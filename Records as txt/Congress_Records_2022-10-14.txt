HONORING SUPERVISOR ROBERT 
WEYGANDT 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
along with my colleague, Representative 
MCCLINTOCK, to recognize the decade span-
ning work and now retirement of Placer Coun-
ty Supervisor Robert Weygandt. Since his 
election to the Board of Supervisors in 1995, 
Robert has been an integral part of Placer 
County Government and business develop-
ment; from his work to establish business cen-
ters in the community, to creating a citizen fo-
cused county government center, to work on 
the Lincoln Highway 65 bypass linking resi-
dents from Northern California to Interstate 80. 
Robert has always put the interests of his 
community first. 
Since the beginning of his public service, 
Robert has led the efforts to drive new busi-
ness into Placer County. Working to establish 
the Sunset Area Plan in 1997, which would 
later become known as the Placer Ranch, has 
created a 400-acre business park including a 
satellite campus for California State University, 
various commercial and industrial develop-
ments, and residential housing units. 
Robert has also worked to create innovative 
government solutions for Placer County, help-
ing the everyday citizen navigate the govern-
mental process. This includes working with the 
Placer County government center to form a vi-
brant place for residents to conveniently obtain 
services and conduct county business. Today, 
the government center is home to several 
state-of-the-art amenities including a new 
Health and Human Services facility that will 
open in 2024. 
Robert has also been instrumental in devel-
oping business partnerships with the United 
Auburn Indian Community during their bid to 
develop Thunder Valley Casino in Lincoln. 
This partnership continues today with United 
Auburn committing to develop the first few 
miles of a bypass from Highway 65 to High-
way 99 in Sutter County linking these busy 
corridors and benefiting many in the northern 
part of the state. 
Robert was also instrumental in gathering 
support for the Lincoln Bypass, a throughfare 
for Highway 65 that opened in 2011. The by-
pass, which encompasses 11.7 miles and cost 
$325 million to construct, moves traffic around 
the City of Lincoln and improves regional con-
nections between business and residential 
centers. This is just another example of Rob-
ert’s tireless efforts to develop Placer County. 
I am proud today to congratulate Robert on 
his numerous accomplishments and to thank 
him for his decade long commitment, dedica-
tion and service to the citizens of the United 
States and the residents of Placer County. 
RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF MAIN UNO BAPTIST 
CHURCH 
HON. BOB GOOD 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the people of the 5th District of Vir-
ginia, I am privileged to recognize the 100th 
year anniversary of Main Uno Baptist Church 
in Madison County, Virginia. Main Uno Baptist 
Church celebrated their 100th birthday on Oc-
tober 9, 2022. One hundred years of a church 
serving the spiritual needs of a community is 
truly significant and worthy of celebration. I 
truly hope that this day is special for the each 
of the church members, and that each one of 
you remembers with fondness and gratitude 
everything God has done amongst your con-
gregation and in your community.

RECOGNITION OF RICHARD DODGE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise along 
with my colleague ANNA ESHOO to honor Rich-
ard (Dick) Dodge upon his retirement from the 
Board of Port Commissioners of the Port of 
Redwood City after 42 years of service to the 
public. Dick is deeply dedicated to commerce 
and to the efficient operation of the port, a 
jewel on San Francisco Bay. 
Redwood City’s port was first established in 
1851 by timber harvesters seeking an efficient 
route to move redwood from the hills of the 
San Francisco Peninsula to a new and thriving 
city, San Francisco. Today, over two million 
tons of cargo typically moves via the port, an-
nually. Located only 18 nautical miles from 
San Francisco, and qualifying as a deep-water 
facility, both liquid and dry cargo transit the 
docks. These shipments often consist of im-
ported construction materials and metal des-
tined for overseas recycling. Redwood City 
plays an important role in the orderly operation 
of the Port of Oakland, allowing shippers to 
obtain timely service for cargoes not otherwise 
amenable to being shipped to Oakland via 
containers. 
Dick Dodge was first appointed Commis-
sioner in 1980. At the time of his retirement in 
July 2022, he was one of the longest-serving 
port commissioners in the United States. He is 
also the port’s institutional memory and helped 
shape its Vision 2020 planning document. 
Through Vision 2020, the port committed to 
maximizing its value to the public by enhanc-
ing public access, preserving the environment, 
and upgrading its commercial facilities. Dick 
Dodge has long advocated for ferry service to 
Redwood City, and the plan reflects his vision. 
Before the pandemic, Google briefly tested 
ferry service to the port, and service is identi-
fied by the Water Emergency Transportation 
Authority as a future expansion opportunity. 
Deepening the channel so that it may handle 
larger vessels was also a priority for Dick. The 
United States Army Corps of Engineers con-
tinues to work on a determination of the cost 
of this important improvement. 
Over his 42 years of public service, Dick 
Dodge was past president of the Association 
of Pacific Ports, and he made numerous pres-
entations before the American Association of 
Port Authorities. In the community, he served 
on the Board of Directors of Chamber San 
Mateo County, the Sequoia YMCA, the Red-
wood City Rotary Club, a bank advisory board, 
and the Water Emergency Transportation 
Authority’s Technical Advisory Committee. 
Serving as a port commissioner is a volun-
teer position. In his professional life, Dick 
Dodge has owned T.H.E. Office City since 
1976. It is one of the largest independent of-
fice products dealers in northern California. 
Before founding his own business, he worked 
for Airborne Express for 12 years. He has a 
business degree from the University of South-
ern California. He and his wife, Ginny, have 
three adult daughters, Kristine, Suzanne, and 
Michelle, and seven grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, it is rare for busy people 
to volunteer for serious work. A port commis-
sioner’s job is certainly serious. The oper-
ations of the port are essential to many busi-
nesses and fill an important role in our re-
gional economy. Dick Dodge and his fellow 
commissioners make multi-decade decisions 
to maximize the impact on commute patterns, 
recreational opportunities, commerce, and the 
environment. The people of Redwood City and 
the Peninsula were fortunate to have Dick at 
the dais for over four decades. We wish him 
well in the years ahead and thank him for his 
years of public service that will benefit all of us 
for decades yet to come.

RECOGNIZING MR. TONY AZEVEDO 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Tony Azevedo, the re-
cipient of the 2022 Greater King’s County 
Chamber of Commerce Agriculturalist of the 
Year award. 
For generations, the Azevedo family has 
been involved in the Central Valley agricultural 
community across both Kings and Tulare 
counties. That trend has continued because of 
Mr. Azevedo, as he has been a farmer in the 
Central Valley for most of his adult life. Before 
he had even graduated college, Mr. Azevedo 
had already begun his first agricultural com-
pany—a commercial spraying business, which 
is still being operated to this day. That passion 
for the agricultural industry has only grown 
throughout his life.

October 14, 2022 
Mr. Azevedo is not only a dedicated farmer, 
but he is also heavily involved in advocating 
on behalf of the Central Valley Ag community. 
He has served on the board of the California 
Water Alliance—an advocacy organization fo-
cused on uniting water leaders in the commu-
nity to achieve equitable and reliable water 
supplies from Sacramento and Washington, 
D.C. Additionally, he currently serves on sev-
eral local irrigation district boards—doing all 
he can to achieve reliable water for Valley 
farmers. 
For Mr. Azevedo and his family, farming is 
not simply a job or a way to earn a paycheck, 
but it is a way of life. Their family operations 
have faced droughts, bad harvests, constantly 
changing environmental regulations and unreli-
able water supplies for years. Through it all, 
Mr. Azevedo has learned to adapt to changing 
circumstances, and always find a way to keep 
his farms alive and well. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring Mr. Tony 
Azevedo for being named Agriculturalist of the 
Year. I cannot think of a more deserving re-
cipient.

DAMARIS DEVORA’S 20 YEARS OF 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
want to honor Damaris Devora, a dedicated 
public servant, as she celebrates her 20 years 
of service to our communities in Chicago. 
For two decades, Damaris has embraced 
and nurtured everyone that has walked 
through the doors of the office of Illinois’ 4th 
Congressional District with a sole mission- to 
provide quality, thoughtful and much needed 
assistance to anyone that seeks it out. 
Damaris proudly hails from Humboldt Park 
in my district, a community that is as culturally 
rich and vibrant as she is. She’s a daughter of 
the 4th; from the district through and through. 
An expert on all things Humboldt Park and 
Chicago, she’ll tell you there is nowhere else 
she would rather be. Outside of our office, she 
is a devoted mother and grandmother who 
fiercely defends, supports and protects her 
family and loved ones. 
Service above self is Damaris’ mantra. She 
is passionate, humble, yet unassuming. She’s 
the type of individual that rocks your world 
with a clever comment, an astute observation 
that makes you laugh, or an outburst of joy 
and energy that is simply contagious. Her co-
workers, past and present, love her as much 
as our constituents do. 
The quality of her service to our constituents 
is truly unrivaled. She has been so effective in 
helping the federal government work for con-
stituents that people ask for her by name 
when they need help, often choosing to face 
wait times rather than leave without seeing or 
speaking with her. She is, effectively, the em-
bodiment of what public service means. 
The amount of individuals she has assisted 
over the years is impossible to count, but they 
hail from all parts of Illinois, the United States 
and even the world. She has fought tirelessly 
to keep families together and to reunite loved 
ones from all across the globe. Her service 
transcends the borders of the 4th Congres-
sional District. There is no greater joy in 
Damaris’s eyes than that of a favorably closed 
case, signaled by her signature bell ring in the 
office. When you hear bells in our office, you 
know Damaris has worked her magic. She de-
serves a medal for her work, yet she’s only 
motivated by her deep desire to help her com-
munity, not by recognition. 
Damaris Devora reminds us that a life dedi-
cated to public service is beautiful and rare. 
This is why Damaris must be celebrated and 
appreciated. Having good, kind hearted, and 
selfless people in our team will always be our 
greatest asset as Members of Congress, and 
we’re lucky to have Damaris on our side. 
Damaris is an important member of our team, 
and her abilities and contributions have been 
crucial to our continued success. I thank 
Damaris for all that she does. Congratulations 
on 20 Years of Service.

REGARDING H.R. 139 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I must say that I am perplexed by 
the Chairwoman’s statements on the COCOA 
Act. Her interpretation of the COCOA Act is 
misleading and inaccurate. There have been 
instances in past election cycles where elec-
tion officials were not aware of Congress’ role 
and responsibility in having its own observers 
on site to watch the election administration 
process and, as a result, were denied access. 
As I stated earlier, this bill fixes a bi-partisan 
problem by providing a citation of convenience 
for existing law that gives the House authority 
to deploy official observers to watch the con-
duct of congressional elections in the States 
and territories. This way, there is no question 
regarding Congress’ authority to have observ-
ers present. 
To my surprise, the Chairwoman identifies 
two late breaking concerns she has with the 
bill. First, she states that while the bill provides 
broad authority to Congress, it fails to provide 
election officials with the ability to protect per-
sonally identifiable information. This concern 
appears to be a novel one, particularly in light 
of the long history of the Congressional ob-
server program. We certainly would have wel-
comed the opportunity to discuss it further in 
our multiple efforts to work with majority staff 
on this topic. 
Second, the Chairwoman expresses con-
cern over an election official’s inability to re-
move congressional observers that are disrup-
tive to the process. Contrary to the Chair-
woman’s statement, the bill outlines the role of 
congressional observers and specifically pro-
hibits these individuals from handling ballots, 
elections equipment, advocating for a position 
or candidate, taking any action to reduce bal-
lot secrecy, or otherwise interfering with the 
elections administration process. The bill also 
permits state and local authorities to remove 
any observer who misbehaves. As such, state 
and local election officials across the country 
would have appropriate protections in place 
and should not be distressed by the presence 
of congressional observers. 
Over the course of the past two years, my 
staff made a concerted effort to engage major-
ity staff on the COCOA Act as we view this as 
a bi-partisan measure. We provided draft lan-
guage to them for review. They did not ref-
erence either of the aforementioned concerns 
or flag any language that they believed to be 
problematic in the few conversations we had 
with them. My staff repeatedly offered to con-
fer on any issue that majority staff may have 
with the bill and received nothing but radio si-
lence. 
It is important to note that we had an initial 
agreement in principle to move the COCOA 
Act together with the PAVA Act. However, at 
the eleventh hour, the majority reneged on our 
agreement in principle to move the COCOA 
Act forward. Again, here on the House Floor 
is the first time we are learning of any issues 
with the bill. 
This bill benefits both sides of the aisle and 
serves as an additional layer of transparency 
and integrity in the elections process. I am 
concerned that, without the COCOA Act in 
place this fall, the majority and minority’s abil-
ity to execute this House’s constitutional re-
sponsibility will continue to face serious chal-
lenges.

HONORING SUPERVISOR ROBERT

Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise

CELEBRATING 30 YEARS OF THE 
ESTE´ E 
LAUDER 
COMPANIES’ 
BREAST CANCER CAMPAIGN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 30th anniversary of the 
Este´e Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer 
Campaign, a co-founder of pink ribbon. Their 
years of service to breast cancer research, 
treatment, and screening are worthy of com-
mendation. 
Breast cancer is the leading cause of can-
cer death among women. According to the 
CDC, about 264,000 cases of breast cancer 
are diagnosed in women and about 2,400 in 
men every year in the United States. Nearly 
42,000 women and 500 men in the U.S. die 
each year from breast cancer. Unfortunately, 
incidences of breast cancer disproportionately 
affect Black and Hispanic women. 
Over the course of the past three decades, 
the Este´e Lauder Companies’ Breast Cancer 
Campaign has become a pillar in the breast 
cancer community. From funding critical med-
ical resources, services, and centers for those 
impacted by breast cancer, the program con-
tinues to actively seek out opportunities to 
help 
individuals 
connect 
with 
life-saving 
screenings and mammograms. They are at 
the forefront of this effort, advancing the con-
versations on the importance of breast health 
education and early detection by facilitating 
discussions between the breast cancer com-
munity, medical experts, and key leaders. 
Three decades ago, breast cancer was a 
taboo topic. For people experiencing the dif-
ficulties of a breast cancer diagnosis and un-
dergoing treatment, there was little discussion 
and understating of what care was needed for 
them. The pink ribbon changed all that. It 
brought breast cancer to the public eye and 
allowed for further public discussion. The now 
iconic pink ribbon was introduced to be a vis-
ual representation of this empowerment, it 
symbolizes strength, unity, and hope. Millions 
of survivors and their advocates wear this 
today. 
The Este´e Lauder Companies’ Breast Can-
cer Campaign has funded more than $108 mil-
lion for lifesaving global research, education, 
and medical services, including $86 million 
funding medical research grants through the 
Breast Cancer Research Foundation that fuels 
research across the entire spectrum of the dis-
ease. Their work has been critical in getting us 
one step closer to our shared goal of a breast 
cancer-free world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating the 30th anniversary 
of the Este´e Lauder Companies’ Breast Can-
cer Campaign. We are grateful for their dec-
ades of impactful work and wish the campaign 
continued success in the years ahead.

HONORING JEFF RAINES AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Jeff Raines, President of the 
Iowa Chapter of the American Parkinson Dis-
ease Association, as Iowan of the Week. April 
is Parkinson’s Awareness Month, so there is 
no better time to recognize the amazing work 
Jeff and his team are doing to help Iowans liv-
ing with this disease. 
The American Parkinson Disease Associa-
tion is the largest grassroots network dedi-
cated to fighting Parkinson’s disease, with 
local chapters across the county. The organi-
zation works tirelessly to help the approxi-
mately one million people in the United States 
that struggle with Parkinson’s disease to live 
their life to the fullest in the face of a chronic 
neurological disorder. 
The American Parkinson Disease Associa-
tion has raised and invested more than $226 
million to provide outstanding patient services, 
educational programs, elevate public aware-
ness about the disease, and support research 
designed to solve the mysteries of Parkinson’s 
disease, with the ultimate goal of putting an 
end to the illness. 
Jeff has been a tireless advocate for com-
bating Parkinson’s disease, educating the 
community about the illness, and a community 
advocate for seniors for over 12 years. Jeff 
believes that with the right research and de-
velopment, Parkinson’s disease can be a 
treatable disease that we are able to subside 
as a community. His day-to-day efforts are 
helping local families navigate challenging cir-
cumstances and moving the needle on an 
issue that affects Iowans across the state. 
I admire Jeff’s mission to educate his neigh-
bors, use his voice to advocate for those in 
need, and his goal to ultimately cure Parkin-
son’s disease. His leadership and determina-
tion are helping to create a future without Par-
kinson’s disease, a goal we can all get behind. 
It is my pleasure to name him Iowan of the 
Week.

HONORING THE CALIFORNIA AGRI-
CULTURAL 
LEADERSHIP 
FOUN-
DATION 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the California Agricultural Leadership 
Foundation (CALF) for over 50 years of serv-
ice to their community. 
In 1970, the California Agricultural Leader-
ship Program seated its first class with the 
mission to enhance the long-term viability of 
California cultivation through developing lead-
ers who can positively impact the communities 
and people that agriculture serves. Since its 
establishment, the program has seen over 
1,300 graduates go on to become influential 
leaders across the industry, which is why it is 
revered today as a premier leadership devel-
opment program. Although there were many 
dedicated individuals and groups involved in 
the formation of the program, much of its suc-
cess is credited to founders Dean Brown and 
J.G. Boswell II who always stood out as vi-
sionary leaders and were consistently com-
mitted to the success of the program. 
In effort to accomplish their mission of grow-
ing leaders who made a difference, CALF de-
veloped a 17–month fellowship program that 
provides individuals with a formative leader-
ship experience through executive coaching 
and a comprehensive curriculum delivered by 
its esteemed partner universities: California 
Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo; 
California Polytechnic University, Pomona; 
California State University, Fresno; and the 
University of California, Davis. By maximizing 
classroom and experiential learning, the Cali-
fornia Agricultural Leadership Program pro-
vides potential leaders with the skills and tools 
necessary to expand their impact, increase 
their leadership capacity and ultimately over-
come the complex challenges surrounding ag-
riculture. A blueprint for success, program 
graduates have gone on to become distinct 
leaders in their families, businesses, commu-
nities, and throughout the industry. 
In addition to this, CALF also offers several 
educational exchange programs that aim to 
raise awareness through education, as well as 
foster 
better 
communication 
and 
under-
standing across sectors. Established in 1982, 
the Washington, DC Educational Exchange 
Program promotes dialogue between govern-
ment and agriculture and allows participants to 
gain a greater understanding of priority topics 
and related policies surrounding farming such 
as water quantity and quality, food safety and 
security, trade imports and exports, and much 
more. Similarly, the California Educational Ex-
change Program takes a more local approach 
to addressing these matters by connecting 
participant with California regulatory organiza-
tions, nonprofits, and local agriculturalists all 
while deepening their understanding of food 
production and ecosystems throughout the 
Golden State. 2023 will also introduce the 
California County Educational Exchange Pro-
gram which will aim to facilitate effective com-
munication, relationship development, and 
leadership skills amongst those who specialize 
in community engagement on the county and 
regional level. 
All this, in addition to their Lifelong Leader-
ship Learning Program, exemplifies the Cali-
fornia Agricultural Leadership Foundation’s 
commitment to education and leadership de-
velopment, which has been essential to the 
continued success of California agriculture. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring over 50 years of California’s 
Agricultural Leadership Foundation. May we 
continue to be inspired by their vital work.

HONORING SUPERVISOR DAN 
MILLER 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to recognize the three-decade spanning public 
service career of retiring Nevada County Su-
pervisor Dan Miller. Supervisor Miller has 
served the people of Nevada County in many 
roles, from his time on the City Council of 
Grass Valley, to his recent time as a County 
Supervisor. His vision has always been to im-
plement common sense solutions to local gov-
ernment issues. Dan is a policy guy, with a 
rich wealth of knowledge on nearly every 
issue topic. 
Dan moved to Grass Valley, California with 
his family in 1962. He went on to graduate 
from Nevada Union High School, Sierra Col-
lege, and earned a BA from California State 
University, Sacramento. Dan went into the in-
surance business. His community involvement 
included announcing Nevada Union High 
School football games on the local radio sta-
tion, KNCO. I share Dan’s passion for our 
local sports teams the San Francisco Giants 
and San Francisco 49ers, the ‘‘correct Cali-
fornia’’ teams. 
Dan served on the Grass Valley City Coun-
cil for 16 years and two separate times as 
Mayor. He was a Grass Valley Planning Com-
missioner for four years and served on the 
Nevada Joint High School District Board of 
Trustees for four years. He was elected Ne-
vada County Supervisor for eight years, serv-
ing as Chair three times. During his time as a 
Supervisor, Dan also served on the Regional 
Housing Authority (RHA), Nevada County’s 
Local Area Formation Commission (LAFCo), 
and the Rural County Representatives of Cali-
fornia (RCRC), where he has served as the 
2022 Chair. 
Throughout his many years of public serv-
ice, Dan’s proudest achievement was imple-
menting the Dorsey Drive Freeway inter-
change, the modernization of the City’s Fire 
Department, working to bring more than 200 
units of affordable housing into Nevada Coun-
ty, and helping to ignite broadband expansion 
initiatives that will continue to benefit Nevada 
County residents into the future. 
Dan and his wife Roxanne, have three chil-
dren—Lisa, Sonia, and Brendon—and four 
grandchildren. Outside of his long career and 
his outstanding service to the community, he 
enjoys playing golf and traveling. I wish Dan 
well in his retirement to the great state of Ar-
kansas, and thank him for his many years of 
dedicated public service and leadership in Ne-
vada County. He will be missed.

RECOGNIZING THE 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CHRISTIANSBURG 
HUNTING CLUB 
HON. BOB GOOD 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the people of the 5th District of Vir-
ginia, I am privileged to recognize the 90th an-
niversary of the Christiansburg Hunting Club. 
The Christiansburg Hunting Club celebrated 
their 90th anniversary on September 24, 2022. 
Hunting is truly a great American pastime and 
outdoor 
tradition. 
Since 
1932, 
the 
Christiansburg Hunting Club has served as an 
organization where generations of families 
have bonded over hunting and sportsmanship. 
An organization that has preserved this tradi-
tion, and the deep relationships that come 
alongside it, for over 90 years is truly worth 
celebrating.

HONORING 
CHRISTOPHER 
PUMFORD OF HOWELL FOR HIS 
WORK WITH AFGHAN REFUGEES 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to give voice to the quiet heroism of a young 
man who has dedicated his time, talent, and 
treasure to the safekeeping and evacuation of 
refugee families from Afghanistan. Christopher 
Pumford of Howell has logged hundreds of 
volunteer hours with The Fletcher Afghanistan 
Evacuation & Resettlement Working Group, a 
grassroots organization that provides emer-
gency support and resettlement assistance to 
Afghans. 
When Afghanistan fell to the Taliban on Au-
gust 15, 2021, the resulting humanitarian crisis 
gripped our hearts and souls. As we watched 
Afghans and foreign nationals seek refuge 
from assured atrocities and even death at the 
hands of the Taliban, a small group of advo-
cates representing the very best among us 
stepped up to find ways to protect the allies 
that had once protected our own. Christopher 
Pumford was one of them. 
Mr. Pumford, a proud graduate of the Uni-
versity of Michigan and the Fletcher School of 
International Law and Diplomacy at Tufts Uni-
versity, joined the evacuation effort in the fall 
of 2021. Since then, he has worked in both 
fundraising and finance, and serves as the 
lead volunteer responsible for dispersing funds 
to Afghans in hiding to cover the costs of safe 
houses. He also tracks and manages reim-
bursement for food drops for these same refu-
gees. His faithful efforts are credited with sus-
taining the lives of 18 families throughout the 
most harrowing year. On top of that, he has 
personally registered more than 100 families 
for evacuation consideration with the United 
States Department of State. In less than one 
year’s time, Mr. Pumford has devoted more 
than 800 hours of service to assisting these 
families with the enormous challenges of food, 
shelter, and security, and has done everything 
in his power to prepare them for a better fu-
ture. 
Despite his young age, Mr. Pumford’s re-
sume is already quite impressive, having in-
terned for the Senate of Canada, the Inter-
national Center for Religion and Diplomacy, 
the delegation of the European Union to the 
United States, USAID, and the Middle East In-
stitute. He is also a graduate of Harvard Law 
School’s program on negotiation, and spent 
last summer on a Fulbright Scholarship to Mo-
rocco. But what stands out most to me is his 
dedication to humanity, his investment in the 
plight of strangers, and his commitment to use 
his skills and talents in the service of the most 
vulnerable. 
We know that evacuation efforts from Af-
ghanistan will continue for years, and it’s en-
tirely possible that Mr. Pumford will never 
meet the families he is working so hard to pro-
tect and rescue from the clutches of the 
Taliban. But their hearts will forever carry the 
story of the stranger who cared enough to 
help. On behalf of those who have no voice, 
it is my honor to speak these words of tribute 
for Christopher Pumford of Howell, Michigan in 
the People’s House.

CONGRATULATIONS TO THE 
MORRIS MUSEUM 
HON. RICK W. ALLEN 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the Morris Museum of Art in Au-
gusta for thirty years of outstanding work in 
collecting, preserving, and sharing the art of 
the American South. 
Founded in 1985, the Morris Museum was 
the first museum in the country devoted to 
southern art. Since first opening its doors in 
1992, the museum’s collection now boasts an 
impressive 5,000 artworks across a variety of 
mediums which help showcase our region’s 
rich artistic heritage. 
Additionally, the Morris Museum is also 
home to the Center for the Study of Southern 
Art—an eminent research library whose vast 
archives support the museum’s vital mission. 
I have had the pleasure of visiting the Mor-
ris Museum many times over the years. 
Whenever I walk its halls, I am struck by how 
authentically its collected works convey the 
history, spirit, and culture of the Southern 
United States. 
For three decades, the Morris Museum of 
Art has enriched our area by fostering a great-
er appreciation and understanding of the art 
and artists who shape the past, present, and 
future of the American South. 
I extend my sincerest congratulations to 
Billy Morris, Kevin Grogan, and everyone else 
at the Morris whose shared efforts have made 
our community a better place.

HONORING 
MELISSA

‘‘MISSY’’ ELLIOTT ON THE DEDI-

LEVARD IN PORTSMOUTH, VA 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to a living icon, Missy 
Elliott, for her groundbreaking music career 
and her contributions to the Hampton Roads 
community. To pay tribute to her remarkable 
accomplishments, her hometown of Ports-
mouth, Virginia will dedicate ‘‘Missy Elliott 
Boulevard’’ in her honor on Monday, October 
17, 2022. 
As a student at Manor High School, pre-
viously known as Woodrow Wilson High 
School, in Portsmouth, Virginia, Missy excelled 
in academics and developed an affinity for 
music. While a student at Manor, she formed

an all-female rhythm and blues group, ‘‘Sista,’’ 
with three fellow Portsmouth natives and her 
childhood friend, Timbaland. 
Even in the early stages of her career, 
Missy was a trailblazer. Instead of signing with 
a major record label, as was common with re-
cording artists in that era, she retained her 
creative independence by founding her own 
record label, The Goldmind, Inc. Her music 
career quickly skyrocketed because of her ex-
ceptional songwriting and signature production 
style alongside her frequent collaborator, 
Timbaland. Missy became a cultural phe-
nomenon because of the artistry of her music 
videos. The creativity she displayed in the 
iconic videos ‘‘SUPA DUPA Fly’’ and ‘‘Work It’’ 
revolutionized how artists expressed them-
selves. Missy has also been an advocate for 
female empowerment in the music industry, 
and she is credited for being a pioneer in 
championing body positivity. 
Over the course of her career, Missy Elliott 
has earned a plethora of accolades, including 
four GRAMMY Awards, six studio albums that 
are Recording Industry Association of America 
platinum-certified, and countless numbers of 
BET, NAACP and Soul Train awards. In 2019, 
Missy became the first female hip hop artist to 
receive the MTV Video Music Award’s Michael 
Jackson Video Vanguard Award; she was the 
first female hip hop artist to be inducted into 
the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and she was 
the first hip hop artist to earn an honorary 
Doctor of Music from the prestigious Berklee 
College of Music. Missy’s impact continues to 
be felt in today’s popular music. She has been 
credited as an influence on other superstar 
artists, such as Beyonce, Ciara, Pharrell, and 
the late Aaliyah. 
Despite becoming a global superstar, Missy 
Elliott has never forgotten her Virginia roots. 
She has contributed to the education of stu-
dents in Hampton Roads by donating to her 
high school alma mater, and through a Hamp-
ton University scholarship fund from her foun-
dation. The latter donation supports the At-
lanta Chapter of the National Hampton Alumni 
Association and funds scholarships, as well as 
tuition and fees for students at Hampton Uni-
versity. 
Madam Speaker, as Missy’s family, friends, 
fans, and supporters gather for the dedication 
of ‘‘Missy Elliott Boulevard,’’ I join them in con-
gratulating Missy Elliott and thank her for all 
she has done for the City of Portsmouth, 
Hampton Roads, and music fans across the 
globe.

RECOGNITION OF BART CHARLOW 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a 1960’s Borscht Belt Baby who, 
of late, has been a distinguished individual 
serving turkey with all the trimmings in San 
Mateo County. Bart Charlow, the Chief Execu-
tive Officer of Samaritan House, is retiring 
after eight years on the front lines of human 
services. We will miss him enormously. 
Samaritan House annually serves clients 
3,000,000 meals, provides 44,120 nights of 
safe shelter, and during the time of Bart’s 
leadership increased donations by 100 per-
cent. Samaritan House provides a place for 
people without fixed housing to recover from 
hospital care. He led the agency to create a 
food pantry, added mental health services to 
the existing medical clinics, doubled food serv-
ices, quintupled case management and finan-
cial assistance, and managed temporary oper-
ations of four additional shelter programs—a 
tripling of shelter capacity during COVID. 
The stories told by Samaritan House clients 
are America’s stories. For example, 72-year- 
old Edwina and Demitrio were living in their 
car, trying to live on their combined Social Se-
curity checks in one of the most costly hous-
ing markets in America. They discovered Sa-
maritan House. Due to its free services, they 
were able to save some money. Then, they 
were selected for a unit in a new affordable 
housing complex, a hotel purchased through 
federal funding. To a large extent, this couple 
can credit Bart Charlow, and the outstanding 
staff and volunteers of Samaritan House, for 
being a rock they could cling to when the 
storm of pestilence swept them into an eco-
nomic sea. 
During Thanksgiving, I’ve personally worked 
next to Bart as we and dozens of volunteers 
distributed thousands of pounds of holiday 
groceries to clients. At Christmas during the 
pandemic, hundreds of families drove through 
the county fairgrounds picking up free gifts 
and food. In pre-pandemic times, Bart and vol-
unteers, including me, would wrap hundreds of 
Christmas presents for children anxious to 
take their bounty home to place under the 
tree. Samaritan House is an official portal for 
safety net services for San Mateo County be-
cause the county trusts this agency’s manage-
ment to handle millions of dollars in contracts 
for services. Its staff follows Bart’s belief: Re-
spect human dignity and lift people up. 
Bart’s come a long way from watching his 
extended family serve tourists at Charlow’s 
Irvington Hotel in South Fallsburg, New York. 
Bart is a painter, and images of the Catskills 
leap from his canvas. Borscht Belt Babies, a 
Facebook group, confirms that Bart’s upbring-
ing was one of family and a tight-knit commu-
nity. I was struck by a 1963 photo taken at 
Charlow’s Irvington Hotel. It showed three 
handsome young men in the shallow end of 
the swimming pool on what was likely a hot 
summer day. Two were white and one black. 
1963 was the year of the March on Wash-
ington and the ‘‘I Have A Dream’’ speech by 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. It was also the year 
that Jackson, Mississippi, drained four public 
swimming pools and sold another rather than 
integrate them. At Charlow’s Irvington Hotel, 
all Americans were welcomed and equal. Of 
the kitchen, Bart remarked, ‘‘I could spend 
hours watching the baker make batter and 
knead dough in the giant mixers . . . . he’d 
fill [baking trays] with hundreds of perfectly 
shaped little cookies or mounds of bread rolls 
in just minutes.’’ I bet the borscht was also 
great. 
Bart joined Samaritan House in 2014. He 
was 65, a time when others hope to retire. 
However, Bart is deeply dedicated to philan-
thropy and brought with him 39 years of exec-
utive experience, largely in the non-profit sec-
tor. He was also a licensed marriage and fam-
ily therapist for 42 years, certainly excellent 
preparation for leading a non-profit. He has a 
BA in Anthropology and Sociology from Wake 
Forest University and a Master’s in Education 
and Counseling, also from Wake Forest. 
Please join me in wishing Bart Charlow the 
time of his life in retirement with his wife 
Nancy, their sons Alex and Michael and 
daughter Lisa. Gevald, di mantens! [Wow, the 
mountains!] is a Yiddish song celebrating the 
Catskills. One of the lines is that, in the moun-
tains, ‘‘Everybody rests their bones.’’ Well, 
now it’s Bart’s turn. He may seek his retire-
ment by resting his bones, but he will never 
truly rest until his fellow Americans are also 
safe, their health secure, and their weary 
bones afforded a cooling retreat in the shade 
created by human dignity.

HONORING THE TREVINO FAMILY 
FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK 
IN PROVIDING INCREDIBLE FOOD

AT 
NANA’S 
TAQUERIA IN WESLACO, TX 
HON. MAYRA FLORES 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mrs. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Alfredo and Roxanna Trevino, own-
ers of Nana’s Taqueria in Weslaco, Texas. 
Originally from Nuevo Progresso, Mexico, 
Alfredo and Roxanna immigrated to the United 
States and opened Nana’s Taqueria in Janu-
ary 2010. 
Since then, Nana’s has become a staple in 
the Rio Grande Valley, serving thousands of 
hungry customers over the last twelve years. 
Roxanna, a breast cancer survivor, has contin-
ually served as a source of inspiration for all 
of us in South Texas as the embodiment of 
the Hispanic values of God, family, and hard 
work. 
The generosity and hospitality shown by the 
Trevino family are second to none, and it is an 
honor to represent them in Congress. Their 
family is living proof that the American Dream 
is alive and well, and I congratulate them for 
their incredible work in the Rio Grande Valley. 
I am grateful to have the opportunity to rec-
ognize this incredible family and restaurant.

CELEBRATING HISPANIC 
HERITAGE MONTH 
HON. JASON CROW

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, it is with great 
respect that I rise today to celebrate National 
Hispanic Heritage Month, and recognize the 
diverse culture, influence, and remarkable 
contributions Hispanic Americans have made 
to Colorado’s Sixth Congressional District. I’m 
proud to represent the most diverse district in 
Colorado. With people from all walks of life 
and over 120,000 immigrants calling our com-
munity home, our diversity makes our commu-
nity a stronger and more vibrant place to live. 
Beginning in 1968, and continuing every 
year since, from September 15 to October 15, 
we observe and celebrate Hispanic Heritage 
Month to recognize and honor the extensive 
history of Hispanic Americans across the 
country. The 2022 theme for Hispanic Herit-
age Month is Unidos: Inclusivity for a Stronger 
Nation. It is only fitting that this year’s theme

necessitates the inclusion of all voices and re-
flects the need for us to come together and 
welcome all people in order to build stronger 
communities and a stronger Nation. 
It goes without saying that the Hispanic 
community in my district plays an integral role 
in making the Sixth District a better place to 
live. In the face of a devastating pandemic, we 
saw COVID–19 disproportionately impact the 
Hispanic community. Healthcare groups like 
Salud Family Health, Servicios de la Raza, 
Colorado Access, STRIDE Community Health 
Center, and Aurora Health Alliance were com-
mitted to educating the Hispanic community 
about 
COVID–19—providing 
vaccine 
and 
healthcare services to ensure our community 
has an equitable pandemic recovery. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to organizations 
like Village Exchange Center and Mı´ Casa Re-
source Center, among many others that foster 
an inclusive environment and work directly 
with the Hispanic community—providing re-
sources, healthcare and vaccine access to 
residents in District Six. 
The contributions by Hispanic Americans 
and community leaders across our District and 
the State of Colorado are tremendous and 
play a vital role in the diversity, development, 
and success of our Nation. I’m proud to cele-
brate and recognize Hispanic Heritage Month 
and all the Hispanic Americans that make our 
community a better and more prosperous 
place to live.

HONORING ARIS MELISSARTOS 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an extraordinary Greek Amer-
ican—Aris Melissartos. Aris was born to Greek 
parents in Galatz, Romania, on December 3, 
1943. The following year the Soviet Union oc-
cupied Romania and implemented a process 
of Sovietization. In 1950 the Melissaratos fam-
ily fled to Greece as refugees. In 1956 they 
emigrated to the U.S., settling in Baltimore 
where Aris worked in, and later ran, a bakery 
with his father. He earned a Bachelor of 
Science degree in engineering at the Johns 
Hopkins University and a Master of Science in 
Contents Early life and education engineering 
management at George Washington University 
and completed the Graduate Program for 
Management Development at Harvard Univer-
sity and graduate research in international re-
lations at Catholic University of America. 
In 1966, Aris joined Westinghouse Electric 
Corporation and soon began work as its chief 
operating officer for defense electronics and 
aerospace. He left Westinghouse as its vice 
president of science and technology after 32 
years with the company. In 1998, he became 
Thermo Electron Corporation’s vice president 
of research and development. He also worked 
as CEO of Coleman Research Corporation, 
Thermo Coleman Corporation and Thermo In-
formation Solutions. In 2001, Aris founded 
ArMel Scientifics, a technology incubation ven-
ture capital entity investing in more than 30 
technology ventures. He also chairs the ArMel 
Scientifics Center for Technology and Public 
Policy and wrote ‘‘Innovation: The Key to 
Prosperty—Technology and America’s Role in 
the 21st Century,’’ which he considers a great 
accomplishment. 
On top of all of his successes in the private 
sector, Aris found great success in Govern-
ment service. In 2003 Aris, a lifelong Demo-
crat, was appointed Business and Economic 
Development Secretary of Maryland in the ad-
ministration of Republican Robert Leroy ‘‘Bob’’ 
Ehrlich, Jr., who became Maryland’s Governor 
in January that year after defeating Demo-
cratic candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend. 
Ehrlich said Aris’ department would be the 
cornerstone of his administration. Explaining 
his willingness to work in a Republican Cabi-
net, Aris said he saw himself as ‘‘a bridge- 
builder’’. He said the basis of his economic 
policy would be a focus on Maryland’s univer-
sities, which he regarded as potential eco-
nomic powerhouses because of their research 
innovation capabilities. Aris was popular in the 
business community and when Ehrlich was 
defeated in his bid for gubernatorial re-elec-
tion, his successor, Democrat Martin O’Malley, 
came under pressure to retain Aris in his Cab-
inet. The Baltimore Sun newspaper reported 
that at a conference in the boardroom of First 
Mariner Bank, ‘‘business leader after business 
leader’’ urged O’Malley to reappoint Aris, who 
was described as ‘‘the best marketing man-
ager the state has had in recent memory’’ and 
as a ‘‘visionary’’. 
Aris has lived a life of great success and 
service. Even with all of his own personal suc-
cess, Aris says that it’s his work mentoring 
and developing employees under his various 
leadership roles that has brought him the most 
career satisfaction. 
As Co-Chair of the Congressional Caucus 
on Hellenic Affairs, I am pleased to honor this 
great Greek-American, Aris Melissartos, and 
offer my sincere gratitude for his many years 
of service to his community. Axios.

RECOGNIZING GAR BENNETT, LLC 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate GAR Bennett, LLC, as 
they receive the King’s County Chamber of 
Commerce Ag Support Business of the Year 
award. 
In 1929, Lon Bennett founded Bennett and 
Bennett Irrigation Systems in Selma, Cali-
fornia. Twenty years later, Gar Tootelian Inc., 
a crop care company, began in Reedley. For 
decades, these two family-owned companies 
were essential to the success of the Central 
Valley agricultural community. But in 2020, 
these two Valley institutions merged to form 
GAR Bennett, LLC. Together, they have 
helped to provide countless resources and 
services to the farmers who feed the world. 
For nearly 100 years, these two family-run 
businesses have been dedicated to the suc-
cess of our farmers and growers in the Central 
Valley. As they have come together under a 
single operation, their mission of providing 
quality fertilizers, fertigation, and irrigation has 
never wavered. GAR Bennett continues to ex-
pand their resources for farmers and growers, 
such as providing logistical assistance on agri-
cultural regulations, deep-well drilling, and 
many other important issues facing farmers 
today. 
GAR Bennett is critical to providing re-
sources to farmers as well as being incredibly 
involved in the community at large. They regu-
larly support multiple local farmers and agricul-
tural advocacy groups and help to support our 
future Ag leaders at local schools like Cali-
fornia State University Fresno, College of the 
Sequoias, and Reedley College. 
While their name has changed and the lead-
ership of the companies has been passed 
down to new generations, the mission of GAR 
Bennett has always remained the same—help 
the farmers who feed the world. These two 
families have helped to make the Central Val-
ley agriculture community what it is today, and 
I cannot think of a more deserving recipient of 
recognition. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in congratulating GAR 
Bennett, LLC for their decades of service to 
the Central Valley and for being named the Ag 
Support Business of the Year.

CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF DR. MICHELE JOHNSON 
HON. DEREK KILMER 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to extend my sincere congratulations and grat-
itude to Dr. Michele L. Johnson on her retire-
ment from Pierce College. Throughout her 45 
years at Pierce College, Dr. Johnson has 
been a faculty member, collegiate coach, ex-
ecutive dean, campus president, and, for the 
last 18 years, Chancellor and CEO. Her lead-
ership has served students, Pierce College 
employees, and the statewide community and 
technical college system. 
In her current role, Dr. Johnson leads two 
colleges and an off-campus site at Joint Base 
Lewis-McChord and oversees two campus 
presidents and a district administration. Her 
dedication to student success and innovative 
leadership promotes Pierce College’s mission 
to create quality educational opportunities for 
a diverse community of learners to thrive in an 
evolving world. Dr. Johnson has consistently 
been committed to the word ‘‘community’’ in 
community college, developing partnerships 
that have made our region stronger and that 
have served as a model for collaboration. 
Under her leadership, Pierce College has 
received national awards, including recognition 
for serving veterans and community college 
excellence. 
Speaking personally, I’ve been honored to 
consider Dr. Johnson a partner and a friend. 
I am grateful for all that she has done to cre-
ate opportunities for students in our region 
and to improve higher education throughout 
our state. 
Madam Speaker, Members of Congress, 
please join me congratulating Dr. Michele 
Johnson on her retirement.

OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Bresee on 40 years of service to the 
district. 
Bresee is a non-profit organization whose 
mission is to battle poverty by empowering 
youth and families in Los Angeles with the 
skills, resources, and relationships necessary 
to thrive. Since its early days, Bresee has 
evolved significantly to support the continued 
needs of youth and families in the community. 
In 2008, Bresee expanded further to include 
family supportive services through the Wilshire 
FamilySource Center. Then, in 2012, Bresee 
joined the city-wide campaign to reduce gang 
violence in Los Angeles by launching a gang 
prevention program through the Mayor’s Gang 
Reduction and Youth Development (GRYD) 
initiative. 
Thanks to Bresee’s dedication, Bresee pro-
vides family services for approximately 1,500 
adults and family members each year. In addi-
tion, Bresee provides youth services for 900 
middle and high school students in the public- 
school system and gang-prevention services 
for 100 at-risk youth aged 10 to 15 years old. 
Bresee is a vibrant community center serv-
ing more than 3,000 youth and family mem-
bers each year. It is an honor to have Bresee 
as a community partner in my congressional 
district. Bresee continues to remind us that 
Los Angeles is a city of hope and inspiration. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring and celebrating the 40th anni-
versary of Bresee.

HONORING 
BASS 
PRO 
SHOPS 
FOUNDER AND CEO JOHNNY L. 
MORRIS 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, as a member 
of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus and 
Representative of the state of Missouri, I rise 
today to recognize an individual that has made 
significant contributions to our nation’s fish 
and wildlife conservation efforts, as well as 
America’s longstanding outdoor traditions. My 
district includes Springfield, Missouri, the 
headquarters of Bass Pro Shops, and I am 
honored today to recognize the lifelong ac-
complishments of the Bass Pro Founder and 
CEO, John L. Morris. 
Across the country, Johnny Morris is often 
referred to as a modern-day Theodore Roo-
sevelt for his leadership, personal commitment 
and dedication to conservation efforts, a com-
parison that is anything but embellished. 
As an unrivaled conservationist, Johnny 
Morris has long recognized the need for citi-
zens to take a strong position in the careful 
management and use of our natural resources 
for future generations to enjoy. Using his en-
trepreneurial success as a platform for that 
cause, he has contributed heavily both in time 
and resources to many significant conserva-
tion causes and initiatives. 
Through his leadership with Bass Pro 
Shops, and now with Cabela’s, Johnny has 
been a long-standing partner of the Congres-
sional Sportsmen’s Caucus through his work 
with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Founda-
tion (CSF) and his advocacy for the great out-
doors. Johnny also served as a co-chair of the 
Blue-Ribbon Panel on Sustaining America’s 
Diverse Fish and Wildlife Resources to ad-
vance solutions for funding a 21st century 
model of conservation to develop the land-
mark Recovering America’s Wildlife Act. 
Johnny’s legacy begins with that of a true 
American success story. This year marks the 
50th anniversary of Bass Pro Shops’ Found-
ing. What started as a tiny bait shop in the 
back of his father’s Brown Derby gas station 
in Springfield, has grown into the world’s larg-
est outdoor merchandiser with more than 200 
stores and 200 million visits annually. Today, 
Johnny and his companies continue to impact 
communities and the future of conservation 
with a mission to inspire everyone to enjoy, 
love and conserve the great outdoors. Key ini-
tiatives such as ‘Conserving Wildlife and Habi-
tat,’ ‘Connecting Kids and Families to Nature,’ 
‘Protecting Sportsmen’s Rights Through Ac-
cess and Advocacy Efforts,’ and ‘Honoring 
Military and Veterans,’ are just some of the 
ways Johnny is helping to protect and ad-
vance our great outdoor traditions. 
A true conservation champion, Johnny has 
received two of the most prestigious awards in 
the world of conservation, honored with the 
Audubon Medal in 2019 and the Teddy Roo-
sevelt Conservation Award in 1990, presented 
by President George H.W. Bush. Today, he is 
one of the country’s leaders working to ensure 
natural habitats, wildlife and the outdoors re-
main healthy and abundant for future genera-
tions to protect and enjoy, having established 
a significant personal legacy that spans na-
tional initiatives and extensive partnerships 
supporting conservation organizations. 
Arguably more inspiring than his dedication 
to conservation is Johnny’s dedication to re-
cruiting America’s next generation of sports-
men and women. Johnny is often quoted say-
ing ‘‘Take a kid fishing. You’ll be happy you 
did.’’ This simple but powerful quote elo-
quently conveys Johnny’s passion for our 
sporting heritage. 
In recognition of Mr. Morris’ service to con-
servation and sportsmen and women—both on 
the ground and in the policy arena—the Con-
gressional Sportsmen’s Foundation has elect-
ed Mr. Morris to the Congressional Sports-
men’s Foundation Honorary Board of Directors 
as an Honorary Life Director, marking the first 
individual to receive this impressive award. 
This board designation was created by CSF to 
recognize an individual who has made signifi-
cant contributions to conservation and hunting 
and fishing, and who strongly supports the 
mission of CSF which is to work with con-
gress, governors, and state legislatures to pro-
tect and advance hunting, angling, recreational 
shooting, and trapping. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Morris 
for his many contributions to America’s out-
door heritage and congratulate him for the 
well-deserved CSF Honorary Life Director des-
ignation. 
HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
REV-
EREND 
GAMALIEL 
MANSFIELD 
COLLINS 
HON. KAREN BASS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Ms. BASS. Madam Speaker, today I cele-
brate the life and legacy of civil rights activist 
and Tuskegee Airman G. Mansfield Collins. 
Collins was a key figure in the civil rights 
movement on the west coast. Under his lead-
ership as executive director, the Western 
Christian 
Leadership 
Conference 
(WCLC) 
raised more than $6 million in the struggle for 
civil rights, mostly through fundraisers at the 
homes of stars like Burt Lancaster, Charlton 
Heston, and Sammy Davis, Jr., and through 
events that attracted the likes of Frank Si-
natra, Dean Martin, Dick Van Dyke and 
Mahalia Jackson. 
In 1963, Collins played a key role in orga-
nizing and coordinating the ‘‘Los Angeles 
Freedom Rally,’’ which drew nearly 40,000 
people including many celebrities to hear Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1965, Collins per-
sonally chartered four airliners to the Selma- 
to-Montgomery marches. On one occasion, 
Dr. King asked him to organize a singing tour 
for his wife, Coretta Scott King. In August of 
1965 during the Watts uprising, an LA Times 
account credited him with saving the life of a 
white man targeted by a group of rioters. 
Born 102 years ago to Reverend H. Mans-
field Collins, a pastor in the African Methodist 
Episcopal (AME) Church, and Amelia Davis 
Collins, a former schoolteacher, Gamaliel 
Mansfield Collins moved to Los Angeles, Cali-
fornia at age 15 when his father was ap-
pointed to lead at what is now known as First 
AME Church. Collins attended high school 
with Tom Bradley, who would become Los An-
geles’ first Black mayor. 
During World War II, Collins was drafted, 
and assigned to the 2044th Quartermaster 
Unit. With recommendations from a Congress-
man and an army general, Collins tested for 
the segregated Air Force Flight School and 
became one of the renowned Tuskegee Air-
men. Collins’ lifelong fight against racism 
began when, in 1945, he and members of the 
447th Bombardment Group attempted to inte-
grate an all-white officers club. This action led 
to the arrest of 162 black officers. 
Honorably discharged, Collins returned to 
L.A. and his father’s church, serving as assist-
ant pastor and musical director, and singing 
with famed actor and composer Jester Hair-
ston. This led to bit parts in the films Mighty 
Joe Young, Imitation of Life and Porgy and 
Bess. By 1961 he had worked with Rev. Mau-
rice Dawkins, Rev. Larry Odom, Bishop H. 
Hartford Brookins, Rev. John Doggett, Rev. 
E.V. Hill, and Rev. James Hargett to establish 
the WCLC. 
Some years later, Collins became an AME 
minister and served out his years with pas-
torates in Tacoma, Washington; Perris, Cali-
fornia; St. Louis, Missouri; and Oakland, Cali-
fornia. In 1995, he served as a founding board 
member and advisor to his daughter, Lisa Col-
lins, in the establishment of L.A. Focus News-
paper, which has become a significant outlet 
serving the African-American community. I am 
proud to honor his memory and to share the 
story of his century of contributions.

HONORING J.R. ROWELL 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor J.R. Rowell, an 
exemplary public servant in North Carolina. 
J.R. is retiring after 36 years of dedicated 
service to his community as a state trooper 
and the Union County Superior Court Clerk. 
J.R. began his career as a state trooper in the 
N.C. State Highway Patrol. He then continued 
to bravely serve North Carolinians as a 1st 
Sergeant for 20 years. Following his law en-
forcement career, J.R. was elected to serve as 
the Union County Superior Court Clerk in 
2006. Since assuming this position, he’s 
sworn in nearly every elected official and 
judge in Union County over the past 16 years. 
J.R. is a Union County native and Parkwood 
High School alumnus. He studied social 
science and criminal justice at Gardner-Webb 
University before completing a master’s de-
gree in organizational management at Pfeiffer 
University. He’s used these skills to help make 
Union County a truly great place to live and 
work. 
I thank J.R. for his many years of selfless 
service to Union County and the state of North 
Carolina. I wish him a long and happy retire-
ment spent with his two children, Kane and 
Melody, and three grandchildren. Once again, 
congratulations to him on his successful ca-
reer.

HONORING EDWARD J. RYAN III 
FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE 
FIELD OF SPORTS MEDICINE 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, a native of 
Salem, Massachusetts, Edward J. Ryan III is 
currently serving as the director of athletic 
medicine at The Andrews Institute providing 
service to the United States Tennis Associa-
tion’s players in Orlando, Florida. In 1980, he 
graduated from Northeastern University with 
his Bachelor of Science in Physical Education 
and completed a Master of Science in Exer-
cise and Sports Sciences at the University of 
Arizona in 1985. He then spent many years 
with the U.S. Olympics in Colorado before re-
locating to Florida in 2016. 
Mr. Ryan has been involved with USA Bas-
ketball teams for well over three decades for 
numerous national and international events. 
From 1995 to 1996, Mr. Ryan was the medical 
coordinator for the USA Basketball Women’s 
National Team. He was also the medical di-
rector and head athletic trainer for numerous 
events, including the 2006 and 2002 Winter 
Olympics, the 2004, 1996, and 1992 Summer 
Olympics, the 1998 Winter Paralympics, and 
the 2011, 2003, 1999, 1995, and 1991 Pan 
American Games. He has also worked closely 
with USA Team Handball and U.S. Track & 
Field at various international competitions. 
Edward Ryan leaves a legacy of progres-
sive change in sports medicine that has im-
pacted all athletes. His medical team model of 
delivery has additionally translated to the bet-
ter health and wellness of the general popu-
lation in America and abroad. Mr. Ryan had a 
vision decades ago to diversify the inclusion of 
a multi-provider team approach in sports medi-
cine that has since optimized healing and 
human performance throughout the wide world 
of sports.

INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROV-
ING REENTRY FOR DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA RESIDENTS IN THE 
BUREAU OF PRISONS ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Improving Reentry for District of 
Columbia Residents in the Bureau of Prisons 
Act of 2022. This bill would require the Fed-
eral Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to place D.C. 
residents serving sentences for D.C. Code 
felonies in BOP facilities within 250 miles of 
D.C. Under the National Capital Revitalization 
and Self-Government Improvement Act of 
1997, individuals serving sentences for D.C. 
Code felonies are in BOP custody. 
Currently, more than 2,000 D.C. residents 
are serving sentences for D.C. Code felonies, 
and they are in BOP facilities across the 
United States. While Congress will not provide 
funding to BOP to build a new facility for these 
D.C. residents, there are more than enough 
existing BOP facilities within 250 miles of D.C. 
to house all of these D.C. residents. Under 
this bill, BOP could place a D.C. resident out-
side 250 miles upon the request or consent of 
a resident, and BOP could place a D.C. resi-
dent outside 250 miles without consent in ex-
traordinary circumstances. 
Having D.C. residents closer to D.C. will 
help them maintain relationships with family 
and support networks and help them as they 
reenter society, which should be a priority of 
BOP. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

RECOGNIZING JOE PODLASEK AND 
JANE STEVENS FOR THEIR DIS-
TINGUISHED 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
TRICKSTER CULTURAL CENTER 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, 
today I wish to recognize the retirements of 
CEO of the Trickster Cultural Center Joseph 
Podlasek and Board Member Jane Stevens 
for their many years of service to our commu-
nity. The Trickster Cultural Center is a unique-
ly Native American owned and operated arts 
institution in Illinois and provides a critical 
space for Native American Veterans and the 
arts at large. 
Among its many important functions, the 
Trickster Cultural Center displays contem-
porary Native American art, provides edu-
cational workshops, and features multicultural 
exhibitions. Joe Podlasek has served as an 
honorable leader of the institution for nearly a 
decade and has been a dedicated and deter-
mined advocate for Native American Veterans 
regarding local, state, and federal issues. 
Jane Stevens is a deeply committed mem-
ber of the Illinois arts community. Ms. Stevens 
curated countless exhibits for the Illinois State 
Museum and has worked closely with the Na-
tive American arts community for over 20 
years. 
Today, I express my heartfelt gratitude to 
Mr. Podlasek and Ms. Stevens for their serv-
ice to our community and for their work in up-
lifting the voices and important artistic con-
tributions of Native American Veterans. 
I also wish to welcome Julia Kelly as the 
new CEO and David Tepper as a new board 
member of the Trickster Cultural Center. Julia 
Kelly, ‘‘Baassa´annee Xiassaa,’’ served in the 
United States Army retiring at the rank of 
Command Sergeant Major after 28 years of 
honorable service. Ms. Kelly has worked tire-
lessly with Veterans, particularly Native Amer-
ican Veterans and Women Veterans, for dec-
ades at the Trickster Cultural Center and other 
government and nonprofit organizations. David 
Tepper has worked as a photographer and ed-
ucator and will be a welcome addition to the 
Board. With the addition of these talented pro-
fessionals, the future of the Trickster Cultural 
Center is bright, and I am confident the orga-
nization will continue to make tremendous 
contributions to our local community.

RECOGNIZING THE BOYS AND 
GIRLS CLUB OF SANTA CLARITA 
HON. MIKE GARCIA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate and recognize 
the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Clarita for 
their more than 30 years of continuous service 
to the youth of our community at their first full- 
time clubhouse. Since 1992, the Boys and 
Girls Club of Santa Clarita has provided in-
valuable resources and mentorship to count-
less children and young adults at the James 
T. Ventress Clubhouse. 
The club’s mission to inspire youth, espe-
cially those who need it most, would not be 
possible without the passion and dedication on 
display every day from the volunteers and em-
ployees of this important organization. The 
time and effort that they invest in our commu-
nity’s youth goes unnoticed far too often, but 
it is because of their tireless work and com-
passion that generations of today’s adults pos-
sess the skills and lessons needed for suc-
cess. This drive to help and mentor our youth 
was perhaps best exemplified by the man for 
whom the club’s first full-time facility is named: 
Jim Ventress. When Jim became director of 
Santa Clarita’s Boys and Girls Club in 1984, 
he set out to expand services to as many chil-
dren as possible and was instrumental in the 
establishment of the first permanent club-
house. 
Years after Jim’s retirement, it’s in this same 
spirit of hard work and dedication that the 
Boys and Girls Club of Santa Clarita continues 
to serve the youth of our valley. They have 
since expanded to include another full-time 
clubhouse and 3 separate after-school pro-
grams available to thousands of children

HOMETOWN HERO—OFFICER JACOB 
ARELLANO 
HON. BETH VAN DUYNE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize our Texas-24 Hometown 
Hero of the Week and one of DFW’s finest— 
the late Dallas Police Officer Jacob Arellano. 
I joined my fellow North Texans with a 
heavy heart as we learned of the tragic loss 
of Officer Arellano, who suffered injuries sus-
tained in a head on collision. 
Officer Arellano joined the Dallas Police De-
partment just over three years ago, and I have 
no doubt he would have continued to bravely 
and selflessly serve North Texas for many 
years to come. 
Please join me in praying for his surviving 
son, Jacob, his girlfriend, and his family and 
friends as they navigate this difficult time.

RECOGNITION OF THE AMERICAN 
HELLENIC 
EDUCATIONAL 
PRO-
GRESSIVE 
ASSOCIATION’S 
CEN-
TENNIAL 
HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the 
American Hellenic Educational Progressive 
Association (AHEPA) on over 100 years of ex-
ceptional service to the communities of the 
United States, and appreciation for their fierce 
advocacy for the ideals of Hellenism. 
The Association was nobly founded in 1922 
by eight forward-thinking Greek American im-
migrants to fight bigotry and discrimination. 
100 years later, AHEPA continues to promote: 
education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, 
love of family and the pursuit of individual ex-
cellence—all to the great benefit of the United 
States. 
AHEPA continues to make great efforts to 
improve the quality of life for Americans in 
need, including through housing programs, 
scholarships, supporting medical research and 
caring for our nation’s veterans. The chari-
table, service-oriented work of their many 
chapters throughout the globe are shining ex-
amples of what the Greek American commu-
nity has brought to our nation—with all levels 
donating nearly $2,000,000 annually to count-
less charitable causes. 
In particular, AHEPA’s National Housing 
Program has been a stable, proven sponsor of 
dignified housing for American’s senior citi-
zens. Through working with the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development their spon-
sorship has reached a sizeable portfolio of 
4,467 units in 87 communities across 19 
states. 
Throughout its history, AHEPA made signifi-
cant and historic contributions to American so-
ciety, and counts among their storied mem-
bers: presidents and vice presidents of the 
United States, members of Congress, and am-
bassadors, among countless other public serv-
ants. AHEPA can be proud that it was one the 
leading contributors to raise funds for World 
War II Bonds, raised more than $253,000,000 
for our nation during World War II, and be-
cause of the effort, AHEPA was named an of-
ficial issuing agent for United States war 
bonds by the Department of the Treasury; no 
other civic organization had yet achieved that 
honor. 
Their historical contributions continued at 
pace and in 1990, AHEPA members donated 
$612,000 toward the restoration of Ellis Island, 
New York, receiving special recognition by the 
Department of the Interior. Particular attention 
has been paid by these devoted students of 
Hellenism to honoring the strong ties between 
Greece and the United States. They raised 
$110,000 for the creation of the George C. 
Marshall Statue on the grounds of the United 
States Embassy in Athens to celebrate the 
historic relationship between our two nations. 
In the wake of the horrors of 9/11, AHEPA 
raised over $1,000,000 to rebuild Saint Nich-
olas Greek Orthodox Church at the World 
Trade Center site, the only house of worship 
whose structure was destroyed on that terrible 
day. Out of love for Hellenism and their nation, 
they have accomplished these great acts of 
charity and brotherhood. 
These are just a few of AHEPA’s good 
works that have benefited our Nation and our 
people for over a century. I know they will be 
continuing their good works, and I am certain 
they will continue to enjoy success for the next 
100 years.

HONORING THE CAREER OF SYN-
DICATED 
RADIO 
HOST 
JIM 
BOHANNON 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the career of Jim Bohannon, a syn-
dicated talk show radio host who is retiring 
today at age seventy-eight after a fruitful ca-
reer in broadcast radio of more than five dec-
ades. 
Jim Bohannon has been the host of the 
late-night syndicated talk show ‘‘The Jim 
Bohannon Show’’ each weeknight for the past 
30 years, including 40 years with Westwood 
One. He is one of the top radio personalities 
in the United States and for three years in a 
row was voted ‘‘The 100 Most Important Radio 
Talk Show Hosts in America’’ by Talkers Mag-
azine. 
Jim Bohannon’s career in radio has gar-
nered multiple awards such as the First 
Amendment Award from the Radio Television 
Digital News Association and the Lifetime 
Achievement Award from Talkers Magazine 
and led to his induction into the NAB Broad-
casting Hall of Fame and the Missouri Broad-
casters Association Hall of Fame. He was 
once the principal backup for Larry King on 
‘‘The Larry King Show’’ and eventually took 
over King’s nighttime talk show slot in Feb-
ruary 1993. 
Jim Bohannon began his career in 1960 in 
Missouri, served in the U.S. Army, and is now 
a proud resident of South Carolina’s Third 
Congressional District. He has played an inte-
gral role in facilitating conservative political 
discourse through the years of weekday pro-
grams, anchoring newscasts, political conven-
tions, and election night coverage. I wish Jim 
Bohannon the very best in his retirement and 
thank him for his contribution during his dec-
ades in radio. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to celebrate those who make a difference 
in our community and country.

REMEMBERING REPORTER 
MICHAEL LOLLAR 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay special tribute to longtime Commercial 
Appeal reporter, Michael Lollar, who passed 
away last week at the age of 74. In a 44-year 
career with the Memphis daily newspaper, 
Mike chronicled every kind of story but was 
best known for features, and for being the 
resident Elvis Presley expert. A charming writ-
er with a dry wit, he came to Memphis right 
out of the University of Tennessee in 1970 
and was a staff writer until he retired in 2014. 
In between, he covered cops, courts, elec-
tions, the ‘‘Deep Throat’’ obscenity trial, James 
Earl Ray’s evolving legal positions on the Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination, and all 
things Graceland. Mike was an old school re-
porter who knew his city, its characters and its 
institutions. He could get complete strangers 
to open up and tell their stories. He was also 
simply a nice guy. I extend my condolences to 
his former wife, Joan, to his daughters Kate 
and Rachel, to his grandchildren and to his 
many friends and admirers. He will be missed.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL RED 
RIBBON WEEK 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of National Red Ribbon Week. 
In 1988, the National Family Partnership dedi-
cated the week of October 23–31 to raising 
awareness about the dangers of drug use and 
the harm that drug trafficking brings to our 
communities. For the past 34 years the NFP 
has continued their work, raising awareness 
for families and schools in neighborhoods 
across New Hampshire. 
For all too many New Hampshire families— 
including mine—the nation’s drug crisis is 
deeply personal. Many of us have lost neigh-
bors, friends, and loved ones to overdoses 
and the harmful effects of drug use in recent 
years. We have learned that the pain of addic-
tion hurts not just one member of our commu-
nity, but us all. 
As the representative for New Hampshire’s 
First Congressional District, I remain firmly 
committed to improving the drug-detection ca-
pabilities of our law enforcement officials and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1050 
October 14, 2022 
will not stop calling for the resources to help 
those struggling with addiction to lead produc-
tive, healthy lifestyles. This is why I was proud 
to introduce the Dark Web Interdiction Act of 
2022 as well as the National ACERT Grant 
Program Authorization Act. These bills work to 
strengthen our law enforcement’s ability to go 
after those trafficking drugs on the dark web, 
as well as providing funding for law enforce-
ment and service agencies to support children 
who have experienced a traumatic event, like 
witnessing a drug overdose by a loved one, to 
support their wellbeing and future success in 
life. 
The mission of Red Ribbon Week to bring 
these issues into the light and to educate our 
youth about the dangers of drugs is critical to 
begin healing our state and our country. I am 
honored to work with the many New Hamp-
shire partners taking on this challenge, includ-
ing our healthcare and recovery workers, Drug 
Free Communities, First Responders, and law 
enforcement from the local state and federal 
level including the DEA High Intensity Drug 
Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program. Each part-
ner carries on the mission to stop illicit sub-
stances from harming our communities, while 
never giving up hope for those in recovery. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
thank the National Family Partnership and the 
Drug Enforcement Agency for your work on 
this issue and hope my fellow Granite Staters 
will join me in recognizing the 2022 National 
Red Ribbon Week.

TRIBUTE TO DICK HELTON 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to Dick Helton, the voice of 
countless breaking news updates, traffic re-
ports, and stories that have kept Los Angeles 
moving and shaking since 1998. After more 
than 53 years on air and decades serving our 
community, Dick is preparing to sign off one 
last time before embarking on a well-deserved 
retirement. 
Dick’s incredible career in radio began on a 
family farm in Brocton, Illinois, where his fa-
ther Kerrick taught him how to grow ‘‘good 
crops of corn’’ on land they have owned for 
over 150 years. After a gig at his college radio 
station at the University of Illinois, where he 
hosted a classical music program, he melded 
his new reporting prowess with his childhood 
pastime by hosting the morning farm show for 
the Illinois Farm Bureau. Along the way, Dick 
picked up another love, politics, and graduated 
with honors from the University of Illinois with 
majors in political science and economics— 
and of course, a bachelor’s degree in jour-
nalism. 
Dick’s professional radio career took off 
quickly in 1969, when he joined CBS news 
radio station WBBM–AM in Chicago as its 
youngest news anchor. He would go on to 
spend nearly three decades there covering a 
wide range of political and human interest sto-
ries, both close to home and far overseas— 
from history-in-the-making like the gripping 
Chicago 7 trial and the notorious 1996 Demo-
cratic National Convention, to interviewing a 
survivor of the Titanic, covering the outbreak 
of war between India and Pakistan, and 
hosting the station’s first-of-its-kind ‘‘Ask the 
Mayor’’ program. His work garnered him nu-
merous awards for broadcast excellence, in-
cluding just about every ‘‘Best Newscast’’ 
award from 1985 to 1997. 
It was at WBBM that he met fellow broad-
caster Carol Ramos, and after several years 
of afternoon-drive co-anchoring and friendship, 
they married in September 1997. After some 
months of living in a commuter marriage, Dick 
moved to Los Angeles, California in 1998, 
where he joined KNX news radio station in 
Los Angeles. Dick and Carol call the Los An-
geles area home, but also spend time at the 
Helton family farm in Illinois. 
For 24 years now, Dick’s deep, reassuring 
voice has been the first millions of Southern 
Californians hear when they get in their cars 
in the morning, and rely on for steady, un-
flinching coverage of the news that will shape 
their days. Dick and his longtime co-anchor, 
Vicky Moore, are often my first call when big 
stories break in California and DC. It has been 
a pleasure to bear witness—as a KNX listener 
and interview subject—to Dick’s great insights 
and wonderful sense of humor over his years 
on air. 
I ask all members to join me in thanking 
Dick Helton for his decades of service to Los 
Angeles, to California, and to the Nation, and 
in wishing him good health and a great adven-
ture in retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ERNEST 
SAUL COWELL 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 14, 2022 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Mr. Ernest Saul Cowell, a 
longtime community member and veteran 
leader in California’s 33rd Congressional Dis-
trict, who passed away on July 26, 2022 at the 
age of 95. Ernest passed away after a short 
battle with lung cancer with his loving wife, 
Patricia, by his side and is preceded in death 
by his daughter. 
Ernest was born in Los Angeles in 1927 to 
Ernest and Beatrice Cowell and was raised in 
San Francisco. At the age of 16, with his 
mother’s permission, Ernest joined the United 
States Army and served in the Pacific Theater 
with the Army Infantry as a Private First Class. 
Ernest was on active duty during the Korean 
and Vietnam Wars and was a former Prisoner 
of War. He was honorably discharged on No-
vember 3, 1946, then served in the Army Air 
Corps reserves until September 11, 1949. Fol-
lowing his discharge from the Army, Ernest 
served in the United States Navy Reserve 
from March 15, 1950, to October 2, 1982, and 
retired a Lt. Commander from the Inactive Re-
serve in 1984. Ernest received several medals 
and citations during his service to our county, 
including the Bronze Star with ‘‘V,’’ two Purple 
Hearts, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the 
Korean War medal. 
After World War II, Ernest attended the Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 
where he received his bachelor’s degree in 
Business in 1950. Ernest later obtained his 
master’s degree and a certification in Urban 
Planning. Ernest began his career by working 
for an international lighting company, then 
later developed and managed his own com-
pany, Lighting Designs Inc., where he pro-
vided architectural lighting designs for residen-
tial, commercial, and institutional properties. 
During his career, Ernest was invited to lec-
ture on architectural lighting at UCLA. 
Throughout the years, Ernest became a vig-
orous supporter of veterans’ rights and bene-
fits. For over 15 years he volunteered at Em-
ployer Support of the Guard and Reserve 
(ESGR), a Department of Defense office 
which 
promotes 
cooperation 
and 
under-
standing between Reserve Component Serv-
ice members and their civilian employers. For 
his years of support, Ernest was recognized 
as the ESGR’s ‘‘Top Volunteer.’’ To further 
honor veterans, Ernest was an early, if not 
founding member, of the Los Angeles National 
Cemetery Support Foundation. Ernest was the 
foundation’s first President Emeritus and 
served as President numerous times. Ernest’s 
other philanthropic efforts include his support 
to the American Legion Ronald Reagan—Pali-
sades Post 283, Ronald Reagan Division— 
United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, Los 
Angeles Police Department, and the Valley 
Forge Freedom Foundation. 
Ernest and his wife of ten and a half years, 
Patricia, had an active life together. They en-
joyed traveling, entertaining at home, and gar-
dening. Ernest and Patricia were inseparable, 
they enjoyed each other’s company, and were 
very happy together. 
Ernest was beloved by his comrades in the 
American Legion, his co-volunteers at ESGR, 
the Los Angeles National Cemetery Support 
Foundation, and by the many organizations he 
aided over the decades. His passing leaves a 
hole that cannot be filled. Ernest is survived 
by his wife Patricia, two sons in Denver, and 
cousins in San Francisco. May Ernest’s legacy 
as a veteran and community advocate live on 
through his work and all those he touched 
throughout his life.
