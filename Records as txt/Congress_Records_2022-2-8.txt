THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE 
ANSWERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of mil-
lions of law-abiding citizens who are 
under attack because they own a fire-
arm. Right now, their rights are under 
attack from the Biden administration. 
This week, it was reported that the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, 
and Explosives is now in possession of 
nearly one billion records detailing the 
firearm purchases of American citi-
zens. This is a gross overstep of the 
ATF’s power. No government agency 
should be spying on Americans. 
Right now, crime is on the rise in cit-
ies throughout America. This certainly 
is not the time to attempt to intimi-
date law-abiding citizens. It is not the 
time to infringe on their constitutional 
right to carry a gun. It is their right to 
defend themselves, their right to pro-
tect their family and their commu-
nities. 
It is time for the Biden administra-
tion to explain this menacing and un-
constitutional action. 
Madam Speaker, the law-abiding peo-
ple of America are awaiting an answer. 
f 
DEMOCRATS ARE DOING 
IMPORTANT WORK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today in support of the impor-
tant work Democrats are doing to 
strengthen our supply chains and keep 
the U.S. economically competitive. 
Last year, the Biden-Harris adminis-
tration and their allies in Congress 
achieved the best record of job creation 
in history. Let me repeat that: The 
best record of job creation in history. 
Texans continue to find jobs with 
higher pay or better benefits. 
We are seeing the best economy for 
American workers in decades, with 
people getting higher wages, better 
benefits, and better jobs thanks in 
large part to President Biden’s Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act and 
the American Rescue Plan and an ef-
fective national vaccine rollout. 
When I visited with leadership from 
the Port of Houston in my district, 
they expressed their gratitude for Con-
gress’ strong investment in the mari-
time infrastructure needed to keep 
America’s economy moving in the 
right direction. 
But they also expressed concern that 
more workers were still needed in tech-
nical training than our current system 
will provide. 
Last week, the House took another 
great step forward to support the job 
creation and the American workforce 
by passing the America COMPETES 
Act. 
Now it is critical for the Senate to 
move on the America COMPETES Act 
to pass measures like my grant pro-
gram for training at Domestic Mari-
time Centers for Excellence. 
The America COMPETES Act will 
also provide real solutions to the prob-
lems of how we start making more of 
our Nation’s critical products right 
here at home. This will provide more 
job opportunities as jobs return from 
abroad. 
It will also make our futures more 
secure by shifting away from reliance 
on foreign countries for the products 
that you and I and everyday Americans 
rely on. 
Finally, it will invest in critical in-
frastructure and development we need 
in science and technology to encourage 
and support our next generation of 
scholars, incentivize innovation, and 
keep the U.S. competitive. 
The bottom line, Madam Speaker, is 
that Americans are back to work and 
getting their vaccines and boosters at a 
record pace. 
The America COMPETES Act can 
continue this trend. 
We must get this bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk now. 
I urge the Senate to pass it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1016 
February 8, 2022 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
rural communities are the heartbeat of 
America. These are hardworking, God- 
fearing people, and they deserve access 
to basic healthcare. And quite frankly, 
if our Nation is going to reap the bless-
ings of our food supply and food secu-
rity and our fuel supply and energy 
independence, we have to work to-
gether to make sure that we have that 
critical access to care, which means 
sustainable rural communities and a 
robust supply of ag and energy. 
Now, in 1969 in the wisdom of the 
Texas legislature, they created the 
Texas Tech University Medical School 
that became the Texas Tech University 
Health Sciences Center. And the mis-
sion was not only to train up the next 
generation of healthcare professionals 
and develop the next generation of 
healthcare innovations, it was to plug 
a gaping hole in rural communities by 
providing excellent healthcare services 
to these good people. 
The Health Sciences Center has be-
come Texas’ center for innovation in 
telehealth practices. 
The Health Sciences Center has pio-
neered telehealth and paved the way 
for over 100,000 rural west Texans to ac-
cess vital healthcare services. 
By understanding the needs of rural 
patients who are at increased risk for 
physician shortages and have a higher 
mortality rate than their urban coun-
terparts, the Texas Tech University 
Health Sciences Center was able to pro-
vide a blueprint for telehealth best 
practices that have been essential to 
our country over the past 2 years. 
In addition to protecting patients’ 
physical health, the Health Sciences 
Center has developed Telepsych, which 
connects patients, including children, 
who are having serious mental health 
issues, to a licensed professional. And 
unfortunately, with school closures as 
a result of the pandemic—and I would 
say later as a result of union-con-
trolled schools—this has become a 
much-needed and much more popular 
service. 
Thank you, Texas Tech University 
Health Sciences Center for being a bea-
con of hope for the health and future of 
our country and especially rural Amer-
ica. 
God bless, and go west Texas. 
WISHING ELVIN N. HOWELL A HAPPY 108TH 
BIRTHDAY 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to congratulate and wish 
Elvin Howell a happy 108th birthday. 
Mr. Howell grew up in Snyder, Texas, 
before hitchhiking to Abilene, Texas, 
to attend Hardin-Simmons University, 
where he played football and ran track. 
After graduating from HSU, Howell 
moved to Kermit, Texas, with his wife, 
Rena. 
Following the attack on Pearl Har-
bor during World War II, Mr. Howell 
heroically enlisted in the United States 
Navy and served as a commander on a 
merchant marine ship guarding the 
United States from a foreign invasion. 
Mr. Howell returned to west Texas 
after the war to raise his family and 
educate the next generation of west 
Texans as a teacher in Tulia, Texas. 
Mr. Howell credits his impressive 
longevity to spending time outdoors, as 
when he celebrated his 103rd birthday 
ziplining in the Palo Duro Canyon. 
What a man. 
Elvin Howell has lived a full life of 
service to his family, community, and 
his country. He is one of the 20 oldest 
living veterans in the United States. 
Elvin is an inspiring coach, a caring ed-
ucator, and a true west Texan. 
Elvin was married to his late wife, 
Rena, for 60 years. They have two sons, 
John and Fred, and three grand-
children. 
On behalf of my colleagues in this 
great Chamber, we want to wish Mr. 
Howell a happy 108th birthday and 
many more to come. 
God bless, and go west Texas.

CONGRESS MUST DO MORE TO EN-
SURE AMERICANS HAVE SAFE 
DRINKING WATER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, for far 
too long, countless people across our 
country have been forced to suffer the 
effects of lead-poisoned drinking water, 
especially 
low-income 
communities 
and communities of color. We need to 
fully fund lead pipe replacement in our 
country to protect our children and our 
neighbors. 
We simply can’t build back better if 
children are being poisoned. 
Water contaminated by lead service 
lines can be found in every congres-
sional district in our Nation and has 
proven to cause long-term effects like 
cancer, brain dysfunction, and more. 
There is no safe level of lead. 
A recent water quality study done by 
the Environmental Working Group and 
recently 
published 
by 
the 
Detroit 
Metro Times shows that there is an 
overwhelming number of contaminants 
in our drinking water, not just lead 
and PFAS, and they are in every com-
munity across the State of Michigan. 
We need $1.65 billion to remove those 
contaminated water pipes now. 
I know experts say that we need close 
to 45 to $60 billion to basically be able 
to provide safe drinking water across 
our Nation. 
The U.S. EPA has historically failed 
to safeguard clean drinking water with 
regulations that are sorely out of date, 
but it doesn’t have to be this way, 
Madam Speaker. 
We must do more to ensure that we 
have accessible safe drinking water, 
and our communities cannot wait. The 
impact on our children’s brain develop-
ment alone is the reason to move with 
urgency. 
This is why I am proud to have 
launched the bipartisan Get the Lead 
Out 
Caucus 
with 
Congressmembers 
DINGELL, MEIJER, and BLUNT
ROCH-
ESTER. We are going to provide a work-
ing group bringing us all together in 
this national crisis that we have. 
Our children and our families deserve 
access to safe drinking water, and I 
look forward to my colleagues’ part-
nership. 
CELEBRATING HATTIE WHITE ON HER 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Hattie White, a 
long-term resident of southwest De-
troit in Michigan’s 13 District Strong 
on the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
Mother Hattie White was born on 
February 23 in 1922 in Alabama and 
later moved to the city of River Rouge, 
Michigan. 
Hattie married the love of her life, 
Albert James White, in 1946. They were 
married for 52 years and raised their 
seven children in the River Rouge and 
southwest Detroit communities with 
love and instilling an ethic of responsi-
bility and kindness toward others. 
In 1967, Mother White and her hus-
band started a community church, 
Love Joy Missionary Baptist Church in 
River Rouge, which cemented her role 
as a matriarch of our community. 
Mother White shines bright in our 
community and has brought so much 
joy to her family, friends, and neigh-
bors. 
Please join me in wishing a happy 
100th birthday to Mother Hattie White. 
CELEBRATING PROJECT WE HOPE DREAM AND 
BELIEVE 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Project We Hope 
Dream and Believe from the 13th Dis-
trict Strong on their hard work on get-
ting civil rights leader Malcolm X’s 
home in Inkster, Michigan, listed on 
the 
National 
Register 
of 
Historic 
Places. 
Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little 
in 1925 in Nebraska. During his child-
hood, his family relocated many times 
to communities in our Nation’s mid-
west, including Inkster, Michigan, be-
fore moving to Boston and New York 
City in his teens. 
The home on Williams Street where 
Malcolm X and his family resided from 
1952 to 1953 sat neglected for decades 
until the leadership of local organiza-
tion Project We Hope Dream and Be-
lieve worked to preserve this historic 
site. 
The house will be transformed into a 
museum that will focus on the life and 
significance of Malcolm X, his advo-
cacy, and as a youth learning center. 
Thank you to the Michigan State 
Historic Preservation Office and the 
Michigan Economic Development Cor-
poration for their help in preserving 
our district’s Black history and Mal-
colm X’s legacy and impact on our 
communities. 
Please join me in congratulating 
Project We Hope Dream and Believe on 
their incredible accomplishment and 
their hard work in preserving our his-
tory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1017 
February 8, 2022 
North Carolina (Mr. ROUZER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Melissa Murphy, my 
chief of staff, who recently moved on to 
a great opportunity working for Duke 
Energy of South Carolina. 
After a decade and a half of service 
here in our Nation’s capital, Melissa 
decided it was time to leave her work 
here in the U.S. House and head back 
home. Melissa started her career on 
Capitol Hill working for her home 
State of South Carolina in Congress-
man JOE WILSON’s office. There, she 
worked her way up to deputy chief of 
staff before joining my team when I 
was elected to Congress in 2014. As my 
first hire and chief of staff, she helped 
me assemble an outstanding team, and 
she helped me build a culture for an of-
fice that has accomplished much. 
Melissa has always been a trusted ad-
visor and a great friend to many. 
Throughout her career on Capitol Hill, 
she served as a mentor and friend to 
many staffers far beyond my office. 
She is always there for her colleagues 
or anyone else searching for advice or 
assistance. 
As every Member of Congress knows, 
nothing would get done in this place 
without the dedicated service of our 
staff who are always working behind 
the scenes. Melissa’s advice, experi-
ence, and hard work have all played a 
large role in helping me to represent 
the 7th Congressional District in North 
Carolina to the very best of my ability. 
I congratulate and thank Melissa for 
her many years of congressional serv-
ice and for leading our team during my 
first three-and-a-half terms. May God 
always bless her path.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO GARRET AU-
GUSTUS MORGAN, BESSIE COLE-
MAN, 
ARCOLA 
PHILPOTT, 
AND 
BENJAMIN BANNEKER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, in 
the past several months, Democrats 
have advanced the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act, along with, 
most recently, the COMPETES Act, 
which will increase American innova-
tion, start making more critical prod-
ucts 
in 
America, 
and 
turbocharge 
American scientific and technological 
leadership. 
With those bills in mind, I thought it 
was 
particularly 
important 
during 
Black History Month to pay special 
tribute to four bold, brilliant, and 
Black minds who have contributed in 
various ways through their inventions 
to innovation and to infrastructure in 
America. 
First, let’s meet the ‘‘Father of 
Transportation 
Technology,’’ 
better 
known as Garret Augustus Morgan. 
Born in Paris, Kentucky, and later 
moved to Ohio, Morgan was a Black 
American inventor. Witnessing a fatal 
car crash was essentially the catalyst 
in Morgan’s invention of the three-po-
sition traffic signal, which is the prede-
cessor to the modern-day traffic light. 
Though the stop-and-go signals had al-
ready existed, Morgan advanced the in-
vention to include a third position that 
stopped traffic in both directions and 
allowed pedestrians to safely cross the 
road. Talented as he was, Morgan’s 
other inventions included a version of 
the gas mask, grooming products, sew-
ing machines, and much more. 
Madam Speaker, a second inspiration 
was a Black American, better known as 
‘‘Brave Bessie,’’ and to others as 
‘‘Queen Bess.’’ The sky was anything 
but the limit to this Texas native, Bes-
sie Coleman. Fueled by rejections and 
constant noes, Coleman’s determina-
tion and diligence allowed her to soar 
as she was accepted into the Caudron 
Brothers’ School of Aviation in France, 
and earned her international pilot’s li-
cense on June 15, 1921. 
Becoming the first African-American 
woman pilot in 1922, Coleman was best 
known for performing tricks in the air 
in both the United States and Europe. 
She 
passionately 
encouraged 
other 
women to learn to fly, both figu-
ratively and literally, by touring the 
country, 
giving 
lectures, 
teaching 
flight lessons, and performing flight 
exhibitions. 
A real go-getter was Arcola Philpott, 
who earned her place in transportation 
history in 1944 when the Los Angeles 
Railway hired Philpott to be the first 
Black 
woman 
streetcar 
operator. 
Philpott opened the door for both 
women and African Americans to oper-
ate streetcars in Los Angeles. Just 
weeks after hiring her, Los Angeles 
Railway hired its first Black motor-
man. Philpott’s time as the first Black 
and streetcar operator represents just 
a small portion of the impact she had. 
Originally from Chicago, she grad-
uated from Loyola University with a 
degree in social science and performed 
welfare work prior to moving to Los 
Angeles. When she returned to Chicago, 
she worked as a nurse and a researcher 
at the University of Chicago’s history 
department. 
And finally, Benjamin Banneker, the 
Black architect who helped design the 
capital city. Banneker was hired by the 
first President, George Washington, 
and came highly recommended by 
Thomas Jefferson. He designed the lay-
out of Washington, D.C.’s, streets, 
parks, major buildings in two days. 
Known for many well-deserved accom-
plishments and contributions through 
his lifetime, he later became a rep-
utable architect, mathematician, engi-
neer, and even an astronomer. 
Black people should be proud of their 
heritage, and all Americans should cel-
ebrate 
the 
achievements 
of 
Black 
Americans. Infrastructure within the 
United States would look incredibly 
different 
without 
the 
inventions, 
achievements, and innovations of these 
Black minds. It is important to docu-
ment and share stories of lesser-known 
historical figures who also contributed 
their greatest efforts. Happy Black His-
tory Month. 
f 
U.S. PARK POLICE 
MODERNIZATION ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor our brave law 
enforcement officers at the United 
States Park Police. From every major 
protest to every parade that occurs on 
the National Mall, our Park Police of-
ficers answer the call to keep our con-
stituents safe when they are visiting 
here in the Nation’s capital. 
However, due to an increase in the 
number of demonstrations and the fact 
that they are extremely understaffed, 
one of our Nation’s oldest uniformed 
Federal law enforcement agencies is 
now stretched extremely thin. 
As of March 1, 2021, there were fewer 
than 500 Park Police officers. That is 
significantly lower than the minimum 
requirement they have of 639 officers. 
This is alarming, and obviously, among 
other concerns, this leaves the Nation’s 
most historic landmarks extremely 
vulnerable. And that is why today, I 
urge my colleagues to support H.R. 
3924, the U.S. Park Police Moderniza-
tion Act. 
And what is the problem? Why are 
they facing the issues that they are 
facing? Well, the bottom line, for what-
ever reason, is because the pay and 
benefits are much lower for the Park 
Police than for other Federal law en-
forcement agencies. And the big ques-
tion is why is that the case? That is an 
outstanding question. Why? 
There is no real good reason. And it 
is for that reason that we, here in Con-
gress, need to immediately improve the 
Park Police’s pay and benefits and to 
put that agency on equal footing with 
other similar departments. To do so 
would incentivize officers to both join 
the Park Police, but even more impor-
tantly, to stay. Both of those issues are 
huge concerns right now. That is how 
we will ensure that Washington, D.C., 
the place where each of us work, the 
place where our staff works, and obvi-
ously, where many of our constituents 
come to visit, remain safe for years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support H.R. 3924. Let’s put 
our U.S. Park Police on equal footing 
with other law enforcement agencies in 
this area so that they can do the job 
that we all depend upon them to do.

hurting because they saw how Officer 
Jason Rivera was taken away from us. 
A 22-year old son of Inwood was taken 
away from us by gun violence when he 
responded to a family dispute. 
But Harlem also is hurting because 
both Officers Rivera and Mora pa-
trolled the 32nd precinct in Harlem, 
and they were both brutally shot and 
killed in the village of Harlem. 
Madam Speaker, East Harlem is 
hurting because we saw how a young 
woman, Kristal Bayron-Nieves, who 
worked in a Burger King, was shot and 
killed. Even though she gave the 
money from the register to the person 
that held up the Burger King at gun-
point, she was still brutally shot and 
killed—19 years old. 
Madam Speaker, finally, the Bronx 
part of my district is also hurting be-
cause an 11-month-old child, just before 
she turned 1, sat in the car with her 
mother and was shot in the face. All of 
this happened within two weeks of each 
other. 
So my district is hurting as we bury 
these two young police officers, 22 and 
27 years old, of Dominican heritage, 
the first in their family to serve the 
Police Department. So gun violence is 
running rampant. And we see how 
many talk about law and order, but 
when it comes to gun violence, they 
are still in the pocket of the NRA; and 
they won’t dare challenge the NRA. 
So I rise because my district is hurt-
ing. And we are supportive of Mayor 
Adams’ plan of precision policing, 
which has identified 700 people that 
have been involved in 1,700 acts of vio-
lence involving an illegal weapon. We 
understand that much more has to be 
invested in ATF; so we cut off the iron 
pipeline that brings weapons to the 
corner of my district from South Caro-
lina, North Carolina, and Georgia. But 
we also have to invest 50 million in 
summer youth jobs. We have to invest 
more money to have the violence inter-
rupters be part of the resolution of this 
violence 
ripping 
our 
communities 
across the country. 
We must all work together to resolve 
this epidemic of gun violence. We must 
pass the package of gun laws that we 
have here on this floor, including ghost 
guns, which continue to play an in-
creased role in the death of people 
across 
the 
country, 
circumventing 
background checks and other restric-
tions that must be put in place to keep 
guns away from people’s hands. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my House 
colleagues to join me today for a 
minute of silence in the memory of Of-
ficer Rivera and Officer Mora. And in 
support of their two families, we join 
them, and we will always be by their 
side. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for a minute 
of silence. 
f 
ONE BILLION GUN RECORDS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, the Biden administration is 
engaged in an assault on the Second 
Amendment rights of law-abiding citi-
zens. 
It was recently discovered that the 
Biden administration has been main-
taining nearly 1 billion records on gun 
sales. My colleagues and I sent a letter 
to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, 
Firearms and Explosives demanding 
answers about this registry. The ATF 
must be held accountable. 
Federal law prohibits the Biden ad-
ministration from maintaining a data-
base of 1 billion gun records. 
b 1030 
What makes this more outrageous, 
this unconstitutional behavior of the 
Biden administration, is that, at the 
same time, they are continuing to em-
power Mexican cartels, criminal car-
tels who are transporting weapons 
across the border while threatening the 
rights of law-abiding Americans. 
Lawful gun owners are rightfully 
concerned, and it is up to Congress to 
investigate further. President Biden 
and the Democrats want to defund the 
police, take away your Second Amend-
ment right to self-defense, and then 
watch as crime skyrockets across the 
country, including in cities like Chi-
cago. 
I will continue to stand up for our 
Second Amendment. As long as I am 
here in Congress, every day I will fight 
for our constitutional rights, including 
our Second Amendment.

RECOGNIZING DR. HAROLD 
WILKINSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize a local hero 
from the borough of Swarthmore, Dr. 
Harold Wilkinson. 
Last month, at the age of 95, Dr. 
Wilkinson passed away peacefully in 
his sleep after a long life of explo-
ration, inquiry, and service. 
Hal enlisted in the Army Air Corps at 
the age of 18 and served stateside 
through the end of World War II. After 
meeting his wife, Rosie, in medical 
school, the pair settled in Swarthmore, 
where he opened a family medical prac-
tice and she worked as a pediatrician 
for children with developmental dis-
abilities. 
For 42 years, Hal maintained his 
practice, 
serving 
generations 
of 
Swarthmore residents. He was known 
for making house calls long after it 
went out of fashion, continuing his 
service into his seventies. 
After his wife, Rosie, passed away, 
Hal was lucky enough to marry an-
other local legend, Sandy Sparrow, a 
beloved former elementary school prin-
cipal with whom he continued to travel 
the world. 
Dr. Wilkinson was a pillar of our 
community, an iconic figure who could 
be seen strolling with his friends or his 
rescue dog, Dugan, until late last year. 
A beloved friend to many, Hal was al-
ways interested in hearing the latest 
updates from friends and neighbors and 
exploring the world around him. 
As 
the 
borough 
of 
Swarthmore 
mourns his passing, our hearts are with 
Hal’s family. We were all so lucky to 
have known him. 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF OCTAVIUS V. CATTO 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate a Philadelphia 
hero, Octavius V. Catto. 
If you come to Philadelphia, you will 
see a statue of Octavius Catto on the 
south side of City Hall. It is the city’s 
first public statue honoring an indi-
vidual African American. 
Throughout his life, Catto was an 
outspoken activist for the abolition of 
slavery and for equal rights for Black 
Americans. During the Civil War, he 
joined Frederick Douglass and other 
Black leaders to recruit African Ameri-
cans to join the fight for emancipation. 
After the war, Catto continued his ad-
vocacy and successfully fought to de-
segregate Philadelphia’s streetcars. 
Catto was a man of many accom-
plishments. He graduated from the In-
stitute for Colored Youth, which is now 
Pennsylvania-05’s own Cheyney Univer-
sity, the first HBCU in the country. He 
also ran the undefeated Pythian Base-
ball Club of Philadelphia, a Negro 
League baseball team that played the 
first Black versus White game. 
However, the most enduring part of 
Catto’s legacy is his efforts to secure 
the right to vote for Black Americans. 
He was a champion for suffrage and 
fought to ensure that no one would be 
denied access to the ballot box. 
Ultimately, his life’s work brought 
about Catto’s untimely death. On Octo-
ber 10, 1871, the first election day that 
Black men were allowed to vote in 
Philadelphia, 32-year-old Catto was 
shot and killed by a White mob trying 
to stop the Black vote. 
Octavius Catto’s life and sacrifice are 
an important reminder of the impor-
tance of continuing his work and hon-
oring his legacy today to ensure that 
all Americans have the freedom to vote 
free from mob rule, gerrymandering, 
and other efforts to silence their 
voices.

FOLLOWING THE CONSTITUTION 
AND RULES OF THE HOUSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
have an article here about the Justice 
Department. It says it continues to go 
easy on the 2020 rioters. 
These are people that destroyed gov-
ernment buildings, destroyed places of 
business, yet this administration con-
tinues to not just prosecute but per-
secute people who just came into the 
Capitol wrongly that should be pun-
ished. But to have people let loose im-
mediately after burning people, being

involved in incidents where people 
were killed, is absolutely an outrage to 
judgment. 
Then, to put people under the control 
of a deputy warden at the D.C. jail who 
absolutely, maliciously, intentionally 
despises anybody that supported Presi-
dent Trump—and she is in charge of 
these people? This is so dangerous and 
should not be allowed. 
On top of that, we have the January 
6th Committee. They were not inter-
ested in following the traditions and 
the rules of the House with regard to 
committees, where both parties could 
submit people for that committee 
membership. 
There is so much damage that is 
being done to this institution. It is not 
the collegial working—sure, we have 
disagreements over the years, strong 
disagreements, but we have never seen 
anything like what we are experiencing 
now where we could have a commission 
that is totally made up of people that 
the one party only wanted on the com-
mission and others that the other 
party wanted on were eliminated. 
So, something has to be done. 
Now, we have seen that this adminis-
tration has not been particularly con-
cerned with its constitutional duties, 
like the one in Article IV that man-
dates that the Federal Government 
must protect the States from invasion. 
You know, to Woodrow Wilson, four 
or five dozen people was an invasion. 
Nowadays, this administration thinks 2 
million is not an invasion even though 
they bring death and suffering in the 
form of drugs, sex trafficking, and 
human trafficking. 
At the same time, for the first time 
since I have been in Congress, we have 
seen that our mail—we have gotten 
two mail just a day apart. One came in 
September 17, stamped by the Depart-
ment of Justice as being received and 
reviewed and examined. Another, from 
a Christian missionary to me, it was 
reviewed by the Department of Justice. 
The Supreme Court has made clear 
that the Department of Justice cannot 
even get a search warrant to search a 
Member’s office, yet this administra-
tion, like this House, doesn’t think the 
rules, the laws, the Constitution, per-
haps, mean what they say. 
We have to get back to following the 
Constitution if we are going to pre-
serve this Republic. It is in a dire situ-
ation. It is in a desperate situation. 
If we do not get back to following the 
Constitution and observing the rules of 
the House, then our Republic will be 
lost. That is where we are being taken 
right now.

HONORING NINA OTERO-WARREN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New Mexico (Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ) 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, today I stand here to honor 
Nina Otero-Warren, a New Mexican ed-
ucator, suffragist, and politician who 
created 
a 
legacy 
of 
civil 
service 
through her dedication and work. 
As the first female superintendent of 
the Santa Fe Public Schools, she advo-
cated to improve education, especially 
for the Hispano communities of her be-
loved State. She preserved the lan-
guage and cultural heritage of our 
communities. 
One hundred years ago, Nina made 
history in our country as the first His-
panic woman to run for U.S. Congress. 
She did so immediately after she led 
the suffragist movement and helped 
New Mexico sign the law. So, 100 years 
ago, she led the effort and was the first 
Latina to run for Congress, and 100 
years later, I am the first Latina to 
represent Congressional District Three 
and her Santa Fe home. 
Her work paved the way for Latinas 
like myself and my colleagues to raise 
their voices and the needs of our fami-
lies and communities in the people’s 
House. As we continue the fight for 
election reform here in Congress, it 
could not be a better time to honor her 
legacy 
with 
this 
year’s 
American 
Women Quarters. 
She will join Maya Angelou, who we 
celebrated earlier this week. Maya’s 
words still inspire so many of our col-
leagues. We are so happy that the 
women poets, educators, and astro-
nauts will finally be the faces on the 
coins of our land. 
PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS OF LGBTQ-PLUS 
COMMUNITIES 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, whether it is in New Mexico 
or across the world, no one should be in 
danger for living as their authentic 
self. Yet, in many places, lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, 
transgender, 
queer, 
and 
intersex individuals are continuously 
targets of horrifying human rights 
abuses. Many suffer cruel and inhu-
mane punishment, imprisonment, and 
even death just for being who they are. 
This is unacceptable. 
That is why I proudly cosponsor and 
support the Global Respect Act. This 
bill demands accountability for indi-
viduals around the world who commit 
human 
rights 
violations 
against 
LGBTQ-plus communities. It also en-
sures 
that 
we 
track 
international 
human rights information more accu-
rately so that we can help end these 
egregious crimes. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
voting for this lifesaving legislation, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. There is absolutely no justifica-
tion for violating another individual’s 
human rights for simply being who 
they are. 
BUILDING ON BLACK HISTORY’S FOUNDATIONS OF 
PROGRESS 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, Black history is American 
history. From the dream of Dr. King to 
the good trouble of Congressman John 
Lewis, Black History Month is a power-
ful reminder to honor those before us 
who built the foundations of progress 
for our Nation. 
Their unyielding dedication to the 
cultural, economic, and political ad-
vancement of all people paved the way 
for others to follow, but their legacy 
continues on in the Black leaders of 
today 
in 
New 
Mexico 
like 
Judge 
Shammara Henderson. 
I campaigned with her and met her 
and just came to rejoice in her wisdom. 
She is the first Black woman judge to 
serve on the New Mexico Court of Ap-
peals and win a statewide election in 
New Mexico. She is blazing trails never 
traveled before. 
It is also through people like Dr. 
Charles Nwankwo, who served as the 
president of Clovis Community College. 
I had the honor of touring Clovis Com-
munity College and meeting with Dr. 
Nwankwo just a couple of weeks ago. 
His work opens doors and unleashes 
the potential of so many New Mexi-
cans. He is truly dedicated to inspiring 
the next generation to achieve new 
heights and conquer new frontiers. 
It is through people like Beverly Mc-
Millan, who works at the Family Advo-
cacy Center to support victims of do-
mestic violence, child abuse, and do-
mestic trauma. Every child, single 
mother, or victim of abuse who opens 
the door of a better future is a testa-
ment to the power of love and compas-
sion. 
These are just a few of the many he-
roes we have in the great State of New 
Mexico writing the next chapter of 
leadership, courage, and service in the 
Black community. 
Judge Henderson, Dr. Nwankwo, Ms. 
McMillan, and so many more, thank 
you for the work you do to create a 
more just world.

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES— 
TRADE AND TRADE PROMOTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in prep-
aration for reauthorizing the farm bill 
in 2023, I rise today to deliver the first 
installment of my farm bill impact se-
ries where I will be highlighting the 
various aspects of the farm bill that I 
think deserve Congress’ awareness and 
support. 
If America is going to thrive, the 
people who feed, fuel, and clothe Amer-
ica must thrive, and the farm bill con-
tains certain programs that have been 
critical to the success of agricultural 
producers in my district. This week, I 
want to speak about two of those pro-
grams that fall within the trade title of 
the farm bill. 
Each year, $140 billion worth of agri-
cultural products are exported. My 
State of Kansas is known as the Wheat 
State, and 50 percent of all wheat sold 
in the United States is exported. So 
Congress must think critically and 
carefully about the international com-
ponents of the Trade title. Trade pro-
grams, 
which 
have 
longstanding 
records of success in America, rep-
resent the partnership between the

public and the private sectors of our 
country. These programs are essential 
because 
they 
spearhead 
innovative 
market access, new market develop-
ment, and promote agricultural sales 
overseas. 
Through the Market Access Program, 
or MAP, U.S. agricultural trade asso-
ciations, cooperatives, State regional 
trade groups, and small businesses co-
operate to share the cost of overseas 
marketing and promotional activities. 
MAP reaches virtually every corner of 
the globe helping build markets for a 
wide variety of U.S. farm and food 
products including dairy, wheat, grain, 
beef, soybean, and sunflowers that 
come from my district. 
The Agricultural Trade Promotion 
program or, ATP, was created in 2018 to 
help U.S. agricultural exporters de-
velop new markets and mitigate the 
adverse effects of other countries’ tar-
iff and non-tariff barriers. The ATP 
supports consumer advertising, public 
relations, 
point-of-sale 
demonstra-
tions, trade fairs and exhibits, market 
research, and technical assistance for 
farmers, ranchers, and our agriculture 
producers. 
I support whatever directly benefits 
farmers, ranchers, and agricultural 
producers in this country because they 
are the lifeblood of America. They keep 
us food-secure, and therefore free and 
self-determining as a nation. That is 
why I support these trade programs 
within the farm bill and why I am 
bringing awareness to them now, to en-
sure that they remain intact for the 
2023 farm bill. 
I also support these programs as a 
fiscal conservative because they are a 
great return on investment for all 
Americans. 
I will be back on the floor soon to de-
liver another installment of my farm 
bill impact series and highlight more 
programs and titles within the bill that 
I believe Congress must understand and 
support to ensure that agriculture con-
tinues to thrive in Kansas and in 
America. 
HONORING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I stand 
today to recognize the dedication of 
law enforcement officers on the thin 
blue line, and condemn calls to defund, 
disband, dismantle, or abolish the po-
lice. 
No one dislikes bad police officers 
more than good police officers. While 
some people are quick to share nega-
tive examples of law enforcement, they 
fail to acknowledge the multitude of 
men and women who bless our country 
with self-sacrificial care. Police offi-
cers are the glue that holds commu-
nities together. They put their lives on 
the line in the morning, and they go to 
their children’s basketball games in 
the afternoon. Most of us cannot even 
comprehend the burden of responsi-
bility that they bear for us and our 
families. 
Today, I will share a story about an 
officer in my district who exemplifies 
the very best qualities of Kansas law 
enforcement. 
Drew Francis started his career in 
law enforcement 20 years ago as a po-
lice officer at Dodge City Police De-
partment. Since then, he has served in 
patrol operations, investigations, and 
now, police administration as Dodge 
City’s Chief of Police. 
Recently, a woman approached Drew 
and reminded him of a time earlier in 
his career when he was dispatched to 
help her. She had been a victim of re-
peated domestic violence, and when 
Drew arrived at her house, she remem-
bered that he took the time to talk 
with her about the importance of re-
moving herself and her children from 
the cycle of violence. The woman said 
that Chief Francis inspired her to 
make this change, and she felt that 
Drew had actually saved her life. 
This particular story is an example 
of the little things that police officers 
do daily, the positive impact of which 
may never be fully comprehended. 
In honor of these individuals who put 
their lives on the line for our safety, I 
have cosponsored several pieces of pro- 
law enforcement legislation, including 
a 
resolution 
condemning 
calls 
to 
defund the police; the Protect and 
Serve Act, which enhances penalties 
for anyone targeting and attacking law 
enforcement officers; as well as the 
David Dorn Back the Blue Act, which 
supports State and local police depart-
ments; and also, a resolution desig-
nating National Police Week. 
I am so proud to represent a district 
where police officers like Drew Francis 
live and work. America must stand in 
support of those who protect and serve 
us, our law enforcement officers.

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Missouri (Ms. BUSH) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise today because, if 
America’s students are not taught the 
truth in school, we can at least make 
the floor of the House of Representa-
tives their classroom. 
My name is CORI BUSH. But Bush was 
not the name that my paternal ances-
tors in Nigeria carried. Bush was the 
last name forced upon them by their 
slave masters right here in America. 
My maternal ancestors carried the last 
name Blakney, forced upon them by 
their slave masters in Pageland, South 
Carolina. 
Our 
Black 
ancestors 
were 
kid-
napped—stolen—from their homelands. 
They were the 12 million Africans who 
were shackled, branded, and packed 
into the bowels of slave ships during 
what is known as the Middle Passage 
where 2 million Africans died. Poor 
ventilation, burning heat, no room to 
stand or room to turn their bodies, 
forced to lay in their own feces and 
urine, they were starved, dehydrated, 
poisoned, and beaten. 
Those who survived the Middle Pas-
sage survived only to be brought onto 
these shores, bought and sold at auc-
tions like the goods their forced labor 
was producing. 
These auctions launched a long-
standing practice in America in which 
White folks—including White women— 
scrutinize and violate the bodies of 
Black people—especially Black women. 
We are going to tell the truth today. 
Black adults and Black children were 
enslaved and forced to endure being 
tormented, being tortured, and being 
raped by White slave owners on slave 
ships and on the plantations. 
Our ancestors tried to escape the 
bondage of slavery just to be hunted, 
captured, imprisoned, and executed via 
slave patrols and convict leasing— 
those institutions whose primary focus 
was to regulate, exploit, and control 
Black bodies. 
More than 1,700 Congressmen once 
enslaved Black people. Those 1,700 peo-
ple who routinely cast votes culti-
vating, 
conserving, 
and 
codifying 
White supremacy did not view Black 
people as human beings. Our own Presi-
dents owned, sold, and enslaved Black 
people. 
The image behind me is the truth of 
our country’s history that our students 
are denied. This is what a lynching in 
America looked like. 
What we must remember is that for 
every Black person they hung from a 
tree, dozens of White people came to 
celebrate. 
When our students don’t learn about 
these lynchings in school, it is not just 
to deny us our justice, it is because 
racist policymakers don’t want White 
children to know that that may be 
great-grandpa smiling in the picture 
and pointing at our ancestors dangling 
like strange fruit. 
This is the truth about our country 
that too many racist lawmakers want 
to prevent our students from learning. 
So to young White people across our 
country: this is your history. The 
atrocities perpetuated against Black 
people for generations were committed 
by your ancestors—not all of you, but 
many of you. 
So you have to know this is Amer-
ican history. 
So what will you do to help repair 
the damage? 
What will you do to help us achieve 
reparations for the harm done? 
And if your history books do not 
teach this history, then question the 
book. Talk to your school district. Tell 
them that we don’t want a white-
washed history. We want and deserve 
the truth. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair, not to a perceived 
viewing audience.

and European democracies are some of 
our most important. It is important we 
work together, try to understand each 
other, and communicate—not only on a 
political but on a personal level— 
through our citizens. 
For nearly 40 years, a cultural and 
political exchange has occurred be-
tween the United States and Germany 
through young members of society. In 
fact, my office is currently partici-
pating. 
Maja Sondermann is a 21-year-old 
from a town close to Frankfurt, Ger-
many, a young professional and stu-
dent studying marketing and adver-
tisement and currently interning for 
my office. She is a participant in the 
39th year of the Congress-Bundestag 
Youth Exchange, CBYX, a program 
jointly funded by the U.S. Congress and 
the German Bundestag, and one of five 
CBYX participants currently interning 
on the Hill. 
Initiated in 1983, the Congress-Bun-
destag Youth Exchange offers young 
Americans and Germans the oppor-
tunity to explore each other’s culture. 
This cultural exchange program in-
volves participants moving to the U.S. 
or Germany for 1 year and strengthens 
the ties of our American-German rela-
tionship through citizen diplomacy. 
Over 26,000 American and German 
high school students, vocational stu-
dents, and young professionals have 
thus far participated in and benefited 
from this incredible experience. 
Even through the pandemic the par-
ticipants remained resilient and joined 
the cultural exchange virtually. This 
year, the CBYX was able to return to 
an in-person exchange in August of 
2021. For the duration of the program, 
the participants live with host fami-
lies, immersing themselves in the daily 
life of a different culture, and attend 
classes, and the young professionals 
even work in the foreign country. They 
form bonds and friendships with people 
whom they meet during the year 
abroad and learn about a different cul-
ture while fully immersing in it and 
building strong personal and profes-
sional connections. 
The participants on both sides gain a 
new perspective on global affairs, poli-
tics, and socioeconomic topics, as well 
as a new sense of empowerment, inde-
pendence, and knowledge of a different 
culture and what it means to be a glob-
al citizen. 
Their contribution to cultural ex-
change 
and 
the 
American-German 
friendship doesn’t end with their flight 
back home. These young minds are 
positively impacted through this expe-
rience, as they share it with others 
after returning to their home coun-
tries. 
Even beyond that, the participants 
stay connected with the people they 
meet and other participants. Many 
alumni of the program continue to con-
tribute to transatlantic relations on 
both sides through the alumni network 
and their personal career paths. 
With the upcoming 40th anniversary 
of the Congress-Bundestag Youth Ex-
change in 2023, and as a member of the 
German-American Caucus, I want to 
draw attention to this important pro-
gram. It continues to support both our 
nations’ transatlantic bonds while also 
inspiring so many young minds to en-
gage in a cultural and political ex-
change. 
Madam Speaker, the CBYX program 
is an exceptional chance for our coun-
tries to connect and communicate on a 
different level and form relationships 
that will last and positively impact our 
future since the program directly im-
pacts the foundation of our future 
young citizens. 
f 
OUR NATION’S FENTANYL CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, there 
is a fentanyl crisis in our country. It is 
plaguing our communities. It is plagu-
ing my district, poisoning our children, 
and devastating American families. 
Madam Speaker, it seems to be ig-
nored by many, however, both in the 
White House and on this House floor. 
Our southern border is an unmitigated 
disaster due to this administration’s 
open border policies. Drugs, crime, and 
the secret transportation of illegal im-
migrants flooding into our commu-
nities without warning in the middle of 
the night is causing serious, long-term 
damage. Yet, it seems to be ignored by 
too many. 
Fentanyl is an extremely deadly sub-
stance. It has flowed into our country 
in droves by way of the southern bor-
der. A recent study found that fentanyl 
deaths have doubled in 30 States amid 
the border crisis. Americans are suf-
fering at the hands of the drug cartels. 
Customs and Border Patrol reported 
a 134 percent increase in fentanyl sei-
zures in fiscal year 2021 with a dis-
turbing 
11,201 
pounds 
confiscated, 
which is estimated to be able to kill 
every American seven times over. This 
is devastating and unbelievable. 
With this high amount confiscated, 
the Drug Enforcement Agency was 
forced to put out a Public Safety Alert, 
warning the American people about 
fake pills laced with fentanyl and other 
fentanyl-related poisons putting so 
many at risk. 
Drug overdoses have hit a record 
high in 2021 at over 100,000 deaths in 
the United States including more than 
5,000 deaths in Pennsylvania. Nearly 
two-thirds of these deaths were con-
nected to fentanyl. 
b 1100 
In 2021, the leading cause of deaths 
for Americans between the ages of 18 
and 45 were drug overdoses. Is there 
any question that Congress should act? 
Madam Speaker, I am a cosponsor of 
the HALT Fentanyl Act. This legisla-
tion 
will 
permanently 
schedule 
fentanyl substances as a schedule I 
drug, giving law enforcement the abil-
ity to prosecute the trafficking of 
deadly fentanyl into American commu-
nities. 
My Democrat colleagues recently 
blocked 
this 
lifesaving 
legislation 
when my Republican colleagues offered 
it for consideration last week. It truly 
is hard to understand why President 
Biden and far too many of our Demo-
crat colleagues, in fact, all last week, 
have ignored this crisis, blocked legis-
lation that would help fight it, and 
have sat idly by as they contemplate 
what the root causes of our southern 
border crisis might be. 
Madam Speaker, if someone can show 
me where we have seen the White 
House actually mention fentanyl as the 
terrible scourge on our country, I 
would like to see it. If, however, they 
were to take a mirror to their own 
policies, they might realize that the 
root cause is the policies themselves. It 
is certainly time for Congress to act, to 
step up and do its job together to stop 
the flow of fentanyl into our commu-
nities.

BIDEN POLICIES HAVE ADVERSE 
EFFECT ON SMALL BUSINESSES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I wanted to shine some light on a topic 
that many Wisconsinites and Ameri-
cans may not really be tracking very 
closely. After over a year under Presi-
dent Biden and his administration, it is 
clear that the policies are having an 
adverse effect on small business. It is 
raising the price of goods, which people 
can see right now when they go to mar-
ket, when they purchase gas, and it is 
slowing the economy. 
While my colleagues across the aisle 
have been really, I think, unable to 
enact an agenda that would combat 
this, the Biden administration’s unac-
countable and unelected bureaucrats 
are trying their hardest to expand and 
enact these reckless policies. That is 
what I wanted to touch on today. 
President Biden’s executive orders, of 
which he signed many right after being 
sworn in as President, have had an ad-
verse effect on competition. They con-
solidate sweeping government power 
over things like agriculture, which is 
near and dear to my own State of Wis-
consin; the airlines; the banking indus-
try; broadband; health and healthcare 
products; meat packers, which we are 
all well aware of; and the technology 
industry. 
It is a broad scope of items that are 
affected. However, robust enforcement 
of the antitrust laws could provide sub-
stantial benefit to consumers because 
that would help ensure that the mar-
kets are competitive, particularly from 
predatory actions as we have seen spe-
cific to Big Tech. 
However, it is clear that the adminis-
tration’s actions are not narrowly tar-
geted at Big Tech where it may be con-
sidered appropriate. But they are part

of an effort to expand government. And 
this is kind of a dirty little secret right 
now. Control over the vast sectors I 
just mentioned are all being done 
under the guise of Big Tech. Giving 
these agencies broader authority is not 
really going to do anything to enhance 
competition, so what we see is the 
heavy hand of government, which is 
right now crushing small business with 
the one-size-fits-all mandates, also al-
lowing these agencies more authority 
over the economy. 
This will make government ulti-
mately less accountable. Rather than 
promoting competition, the Federal 
Trade Commission is now imposing 
more costs on businesses. They are 
driving up prices on consumers, and 
this ultimately will force inflation 
even higher. There is just too much 
cash in the economy right now with 
very few supplies and services avail-
able. That is what inflation is. 
The FTC and the DOJ recently an-
nounced that they will be revising 
merger guidelines out of nowhere, out 
of the blue, and seem to assume that 
mergers harm competition and fail to 
realize efficiencies. Companies are also 
facing the FTC inquiries related to 
unionization and environmental and 
social issues, which are well outside of 
the agency’s mission and also is not re-
lated to their responsibilities in and 
around upholding competition. 
The FTC has also required prior ap-
proval for future deals from businesses 
with a previous violation; again, all of 
a sudden, out of the blue, effectively 
making them guilty without the pre-
sumption of innocence. 
Even more bizarre than we could ever 
imagine, many of the actions have been 
done using so-called ‘‘zombie votes’’ 
from a commissioner who is no longer 
there; not even in the system. The 
clear intent of these actions is to dis-
courage businesses to engage in the 
legal conduct of mergers. 
Even 
former 
President 
Obama’s 
Treasury Secretary, Larry Summers, 
numerous times has stated that these 
policies will reduce supply, which will 
increase prices while discouraging in-
vestment. If the FTC and the unac-
countable bureaucrats at the other 
agencies, such as the FDIC, continue to 
stray from the rule of law, Americans 
will face higher prices. 
f 
HONORING 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE MIGHTY EIGHTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor the 80th anniversary of the 
Mighty Eighth Air Force unit. The 
Mighty Eighth Air Force was organized 
in Savannah, Georgia, on January 28 in 
1942. It was comprised of 48 bomber 
groups, 21 fighter groups, and three 
photo reconnaissance groups, making 
it the largest of its kind at the time. 
The Mighty Eighth was utilized heav-
ily over the course of World War II, 
participating in primarily heavy bom-
bardment of strategic and military tar-
gets in Nazi-occupied Europe and Ger-
many. The Mighty Eighth Air Force 
Museum opened its doors in 1996, in 
Pooler, Georgia, during my tenure as 
mayor. It tells the heroic story of the 
Mighty Eighth, along with the story of 
World War II. 
Featuring a B–17 project from the 
National Air and Space Museum, a fire 
truck used at Hunter Army Airfield in 
Savannah, along with multiple other 
aircraft 
and 
state-of-the-art 
tech-
nology, the Mighty Eighth Air Force 
Museum is a remarkable tribute to our 
brave soldiers. 
The celebration kicked off on the 
28th of January and events will be held 
throughout the year to celebrate this 
momentous occasion. I am proud to 
have been involved in the construction 
and dedication of this tribute to Amer-
ican heroism and want to thank the 
staff and supporters for making this 
celebration possible. 
HONORING GUS BELL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in gratitude for 
the service of a friend and an instru-
mental member of the First District of 
Georgia, Mr. Gus Bell. 
Gus is a proud graduate of The Cita-
del, where he received a bachelor’s de-
gree in civil engineering. From The 
Citadel, he continued his education at 
the University of Kentucky. Gus Bell 
has worked in every aspect of engineer-
ing, starting his career with U.S. Army 
Corps of Engineers in Virginia and Al-
buquerque before joining his private 
firm. 
I am proud to call Gus Bell a friend 
and have had the pleasure and oppor-
tunity to work with him throughout 
the years. He has had an enormous im-
pact on my career. The work that Gus 
has done to better the First District is 
nothing short of remarkable and de-
serves recognition. 
The red brick waterfront, Rousakis 
Plaza, in Savannah and the I–95 cor-
ridor in Pooler are just examples of 
how Gus’ expertise has led to growth 
and new development for the great 
State of Georgia. His commitment to 
his community is an inspiration, and I 
cherish the time we had to work to-
gether. 
Gus is an example of a servant to 
others, and we are very grateful for his 
years of work and commitment. Thank 
you, my friend. 
RECOGNIZING JEKYLL ISLAND’S 75TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Jekyll Island’s 75th anniversary 
as a State park. Under Governor M.E. 
Thompson, Jekyll Island was pur-
chased in 1947 and Jekyll authorities 
will be having events throughout 2022 
to celebrate 75 years. 
This island has been a vacation spot 
for Georgians across the State for dec-
ades, and it will continue to be for 
years to come. Recently, Jekyll has ex-
perienced increasing growth with the 
construction of a hotel in 2010, parks, 
camp sites, public beaches, and more. 
The biggest addition to Jekyll Island 
was conducted in 2015 with a revamped 
shopping center, Beach Village, hotels, 
and the Westin Jekyll Island opening. I 
had the privilege of attending the kick-
off celebration, complete with fire-
works and synchronized swimmers, and 
am excited for what the rest of 2022 has 
in store for Jekyll. 
COVID hit the hospitality industry 
especially hard and Jekyll Island was 
no exception. Through resiliency, hard 
work, and a dedicated community, Je-
kyll Island will be back in full force 
and better than ever. 
This great Georgia vacation spot will 
be back on the map as a must-see for 
residents and people across the coun-
try.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

Many are the plans in our hearts 
today, O Lord, numerous agendas and 
schedules, lists of expectations, and 
countless intentions. We lay all of our 
efforts before You that Your purpose 
would prevail; that Your direction and 
design, Your will and aim would guide 
our lives. 
It seems that our days are driven by 
overwhelming demands on our time, 
goals to accomplish, and deadlines to 
meet. We commit to You, Holy God, all 
that we hope to do today, that You, in 
Your mercy, would allow our plans to 
prosper. 
The way seems clear in our minds; 
Lord, would that You establish our 
steps this day. May we receive the gift 
of Your counsel and the excellence of 
Your wisdom. 
We pray this prayer in the certainty 
of Your holy name. 
Amen.

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Postal Service Reform Act. This legis-
lation would finally eliminate the re-
quirement for the Postal Service to 
prefund pension costs 75 years in ad-
vance. The mandate is punitive to the 
post office and to the people it serves. 
The unreasonable and unsustainable 
mandate risks the affordability of mail 
delivery for customers and it threatens 
the livelihood of hardworking Ameri-
cans. 
The Postal Service employs 630,000 
workers nationwide, including 100,000 
military veterans, and 6,100 Western 
New Yorkers. Each and every day these 
workers deliver for their communities. 
We have an opportunity today to se-
cure the future of one of the most his-
toric and trusted agencies in the Na-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
f 
TEXAS–25 CHAMPIONS 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, I take a moment to recognize the 
extraordinary 
accomplishment 
of 
Texas-25’s high school football teams 
this past season. Texas-25 was home to 
two champions, and I was proud to see 
all the hard work pay off on the field. 
After a season of early mornings, 
long hours on the field, and staying fo-
cused in school, these teams showed 
dedication, strength, and an unwaver-
ing 
commitment 
to 
victory. 
In 
Stephenville, the Yellow Jackets be-
came the 4A Division I Football State 
Champions after beating the Austin 
Jaguars 38–21, marking their sixth 
Texas State football title. 
The Westlake Chaparrals were named 
the Class 6A Division II State cham-
pions with a 40–21 win over Denton 
Guyer, cementing their third-straight 
State championship and finishing the 
season undefeated with a 16–0 record. 
As these winners prepare for their 
next endeavors, I wish them the best of 
luck for an even brighter and more vic-
torious future. Winning is good. Go 
Chaps and go Yellow Jackets. In God 
we trust. 
SKYROCKETING PRICE OF LUMBER 
(Mrs. TORRES of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to express concern 
about the skyrocketing prices of lum-
ber, which is adding to the instability 
of the housing market. Lumber prices 
have hit record highs; yet, there is still 
tariffs on imports of softwood lumber. 
With high tariffs, our low housing in-
ventory will still not improve. 
According to the National Associa-
tion of Homebuilders, America’s hous-
ing affordability crisis and price swings 
in lumber have added more than $18,000 
to the price of a new home; meaning 
Americans needed an average income 
of $144,000 to afford a home last year, 
more than double the median house-
hold income in my district. With al-
most no stock and rising prices, pro-
spective buyers are faced with terrible 
bidding wars, wars that can only be 
won by cash-only investors. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the Biden Admin-
istration to make the high price of 
lumber a priority to improve the af-
fordable housing market. 
f 
APPRECIATING EMILY SALEEBY 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am sincerely grateful to rec-
ognize Emily Saleeby, deputy chief of 
staff for the Second Congressional Dis-
trict of South Carolina. Emily has been 
dedicated and passionate serving the 
people of South Carolina. 
A native of Florence, and a graduate 
of the University of South Carolina, 
where she was student body vice presi-
dent, Emily began working in Congress 
in 2014. She has achieved being some-
one who could be relied on for being a 
dedicated public servant. She is return-
ing to South Carolina for a position 
with Savannah River Mission Comple-
tion, where she will continue to be suc-
cessful. 
I know her parents, Suzanne and 
John Saleeby, siblings, Lauren and 
Timothy, her golden retriever, Cato, 
and her colleagues share my deep ap-
preciation for her continued success. 
Lebanese Americans are vital in South 
Carolina. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from the Afghan safe 
haven to America. 
Go Gamecocks! Go Emily!

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. JOHN 
C. LAW 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Mr. Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Mr. John C. Law, who 
passed away on January 20, 2022. A resi-
dent of the city of Santa Monica, John 
was a beloved husband, father, and 
champion of affordable, high-quality 
healthcare. 
John dedicated his life to serving 
others and was a generous philan-
thropist through Los Angeles County 
during his time on the board of direc-
tors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
During his tenure, John championed ef-
forts to bring women and people of 
color onto the board of directors and to 
better the health and well-being of the 
community. 
As President of the Los Angeles Free 
Clinic, John also worked to improve 
healthcare quality, access, and out-
comes for underserved communities in 
the region. John also contributed to 
healthcare causes and research not 
only 
through 
his 
leadership, 
but 
through his tremendous generosity. 
John and his wife, Hope, made their 
first gift in 1992 and contributed fre-
quently to its prostate cancer research 
and healthcare leadership funds. An ac-
complished businessman, John served 
as president of the LA County Capital 
Asset Leasing Corporation and as co- 
managing director of Warland Invest-
ments. 
John is survived by his loving wife, 
Hope Warshaw, and their son, Jack 
Warshaw. He had an amazing spirit 
that was dedicated to serving his fam-
ily and especially those most in need. 
John will be greatly missed by his 
friends, family, and all who knew him.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA—112th 
ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
the 112th anniversary of the Boy 
Scouts of America. On February 8, 1910, 
Chicago 
businessman, 
William 
D. 
Boyce, who grew up in Western Penn-
sylvania, incorporated the Boy Scouts 
of America. 
Since that time, millions of young 
men and women have joined the Scouts 
and learned the values of patriotism, 
courage, and self-reliance. 
The Scouts have helped shaped some 
of the most memorable figures in U.S. 
history: Former President George W. 
Bush, Martin Luther King, Jr., and 
even retiring Supreme Court Justice, 
Stephen Breyer. 
Mr. Speaker, I have spent more than 
50 years in scouting, including serving 
as Scout Master and achieving the 
rank of Eagle Scout in 1977. It was 
these experiences that first sparked my 
interest in public service. The Boy 
Scout oath, in part, urges us to per-
form our duty to our country. I am 
proud to introduce this resolution des-
ignating today as Boy Scouts of Amer-
ica Day to honor the tireless service of 
Scout volunteers and participants in 
our communities. 
Mr. Speaker, I have witnessed first-
hand the important principles, values,

Boy Scouts of America has played a 
pivotal role in shaping the leaders of 
tomorrow and I look forward to seeing 
their continued contributions to our 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, after the Bible, prob-
ably this manual, the Boy Scout Hand-
book, has done more to shape my life 
and made me the person that I am 
today.

VERMONT POSTAL SERVICE 
(Mr. WELCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, the Postal 
Service is a mess. Today, we are about 
to take up a reform proposal that is 
long overdue. 
Mail delivery in rural Vermont is 
critical for all our rural communities. 
For our seniors who rely on getting 
their checks and getting their prescrip-
tions, and for Vermont businesses, 
from local papers that provide news in 
our country stores, it is crucial. 
Mismanagement, underfunding, labor 
shortages have really created a crisis. 
Last January, my office received eight 
complaints. This January, it was 69 
complaints. And some Vermonters are 
going over a week without getting any 
mail delivery. Our folks are going pay-
check to paycheck and not getting 
their paycheck. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill will finally get 
the United States Postal Service on 
track for our rural communities and 
all Americans. It is overdue, and that 
is why I hope all of us will support pas-
sage today. 
f 
RISING DRUG PRICES 
(Mr. LATURNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss an important issue 
that is deeply concerning to Kansans: 
Rising drug prices. 
So far this year, the price of hun-
dreds 
of 
lifesaving 
pharmaceutical 
medications have already increased. 
Hardworking Kansas families are fac-
ing skyrocketing inflation and many 
simply do not have the funds to keep 
up 
with 
the 
never-ending 
rise 
in 
healthcare costs. 
For the past three decades, the bipar-
tisan 340B program has helped low-in-
come families afford essential medica-
tions 
by 
requiring 
pharmaceutical 
companies to give safety-net and rural 
healthcare providers discounts on pre-
scription drugs. In my home State of 
Kansas, we have over 80 hospitals that 
use 340B savings. Not only do 340B hos-
pitals provide heavily discounted pre-
scription medications, they also make 
additional healthcare services, such as 
trauma care and substance abuse treat-
ment available to most of our vulner-
able patients. 
As the 340B program celebrates its 
30th anniversary, it is vital that we re-
affirm our commitment to protecting 
this program and ensuring all Kansans 
have access to quality and affordable 
healthcare. 
f 
WILD HORSE AND BURRO 
PROTECTION ACT 
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, in efforts to 
control equine populations, the BLM is 
directed to humanely capture wild, 
free-roaming horses and burros and put 
them up for adoption. 
BLM, however, uses helicopter com-
panies to round up these animals, lead-
ing to frightening and sometimes dead-
ly situations. At $500 a head, since 2011, 
the top three helicopter contractors 
have raked in some $37 million in tax-
payer funding. 
Last month, during a gathering at 
the Pancake Complex in central Ne-
vada, a young colt was chased for miles 
by a helicopter, despite having a bro-
ken leg, and had to be put down when 
captured. 
My Wild Horse and Burro Protection 
Act would outlaw the use of helicopters 
in wild horse roundups, employ more 
traditional wranglers for gathering ef-
forts, and require the GAO to employ 
and explore humane alternatives to 
protect these icons of the wild west. 
Mr. Speaker, put simply, save a 
horse, hire a cowboy. 
f 
BIDEN’S VOW TO END NORD 
STREAM 2 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, energy 
security for the free world is an imper-
ative. I rise today to strongly endorse 
President Biden’s vow yesterday that if 
Russia further invades Ukraine, there 
will, ‘‘no longer be a Nord Stream 2 
pipeline across Europe. We will put an 
end to it.’’ 
During the Trump administration, 
this Russian energy pipeline was al-
lowed to creep ever closer into the 
heart of Europe to make our closest 
NATO allies dependent on Russian gas. 
What a strategic failure. 
Reliance on a tyrannical regime is 
dangerous. To our dear allies in Eu-
rope, if Putin were to succeed in 
clawing Ukraine back under Russia’s 
command, he would not stop there. 
The free world must place stronger 
sanctions on Nord Stream 2. It must 
ratchet up diplomat engagement to 
this strongest test of the rule of law 
since World War II. As Russian troops 
amass at Ukraine’s border, the free 
world must deploy the defensive shield 
to protect her liberty and assure her 
territorial sovereignty through a coali-
tion of the willing.

myself such time as I may consume. 
During consideration of this resolu-
tion, all time yielded is for the purpose 
of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day, we met in the Rules Committee 
and reported a rule, House Resolution 
912, providing for consideration of two 
different measures; first, H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Service Reform Act of 2022, 
under a structured rule. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform. It makes in 
order a manager’s amendment and pro-
vides for one motion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 6617, the Further Addi-
tional Extending Government Funding 
Act, under a closed rule. The rule pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Appropriations and provides for one 
motion to recommit. 
Finally, the resolution adopts H. 
Con. Res. 69, which provides for a joint 
session of Congress to receive a mes-
sage from the President, and the rule 
restricts former Members’ access to the 
House floor during the joint session. 
Mr. Speaker, the Postal Service Re-
form Act is a major update and im-
provement to what is going on with our 
post office. Even in this increasingly 
digital world, Americans rely on the 
U.S. Postal Service for access to life-
saving prescription drugs and other es-
sential items of living. 
In the ongoing pandemic, the Postal 
Service has been critical in helping 
tens of millions of Americans vote 
safely and securely. 
The Postal Service is processing an 
astounding 5,000 pieces of mail each 
second and is responsible for processing 
and delivering 46 percent of the world’s 
mail. 
It is no surprise that first class mail 
used to send things like letters and 
bills is on the decline in the digital en-
vironment we live in. Still, the Postal 
Service remains a critical lifeline, es-
pecially for people who live in rural 
areas and Tribal communities and for 
people with disabilities. 
The Postal Service adds a million 
new delivery points each year. That 
means that the Postal Service is deliv-
ering a little bit less mail but to a lot 
more places. 
This act addresses the financial needs 
of the Postal Service, ensuring that we 
can continue relying on it for genera-
tions to come. 
The decline in first class mail, in-
creasing expenses, and the requirement 
that the Postal Service prefund retiree 
health benefits have all contributed to 
some financial instability in the Postal 
Service. 
H.R. 3076 puts USPS on a far more 
stable financial footing. Specifically, it 
requires future Postal Service retirees 
to enroll in Medicare, saving the Postal 
Service $22 billion over the next dec-
ade. While retirees have paid into 
Medicare their entire careers, a quarter 
of retirees choose not to enroll, requir-
ing the Postal Service to pay for higher 
premiums. 
Similarly, the legislation also elimi-
nates the uniquely arduous require-
ment that USPS prefund retiree health 
benefits for a period of 75 years. No 
other company or governmental entity 
has this requirement, which has re-
sulted in significant financial losses for 
USPS. 
The Postal Service Reform Act also 
strengthens transparency and requires 
6-day 
integrated 
delivery, 
ensuring 
high-quality mail service for at least 6 
days a week to all Americans. It re-
quires USPS to develop an online dash-
board detailing weekly national and 
local-level performance data to pro-
mote compliance with on-time mail de-
livery. 
Mr. Speaker, the consideration of 
this measure gives us the opportunity 
to celebrate the remarkable successes 
of the post office in our history. The 
Founders created the post office even 
before they signed the Declaration of 
Independence, and they named, of 
course, Benjamin Franklin as the first 
Postmaster General for the emerging 
Nation. 
It was the post office that unified 13 
divergent and quarreling Colonies into 
a nation as it created a great commu-
nications network that brought the 
news of the day and the news of public 
events to the doorstep of every fledg-
ling American citizen. It was an idea 
that scandalized and horrified the Eu-
ropean powers that, of course, always 
wanted to keep the people in the dark 
under the monarchies and aristocracies 
of Europe. 
The post office also created the 
transportation system for America, 
which is why so many of our towns and 
cities have streets and roads called 
Post Road or Postal Road or Old Post 
Road running through the center of 
town. 
The post office, of course, was an ex-
plicit delegation of power to Congress 
in the Constitution, as well as the 
power to build postal roads under Arti-
cle I, Section 8. 
The communications and transpor-
tation network created by the post of-
fice gave rise to the democratic polit-
ical infrastructure of the Nation. This 
is how the committees of correspond-
ence met that created the political will 
for the American Revolution and devel-
oped the political philosophy of our 
revolutionary forebearers. 
The post office also gave rise to 
America’s glorious free press. That is 
why so many of our newspapers, again, 
bear the name The Washington Post, 
the Buffalo-Courier Express, the Rich-
mond 
Times-Dispatch. 
They 
were 
named after the postal operation that 
made the mass media possible in the 
country. 
The post office has done wonders for 
American commerce and business, and 
continues to do that right up to today, 
so this legislation will help the post of-
fice grow and meet our needs in the 
new century. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman and my 
friend from Maryland for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
makes in order H.R. 6617, a resolution 
to 
fund 
the 
Federal 
Government 
through March 11, 2022, and H.R. 3076, 
the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. 
I know that Appropriations Chair-
woman DELAURO and Ranking Member 
GRANGER continue to engage in bipar-
tisan discussions to find a path forward 
on a fiscal year 2022 funding package, 
and I want to thank them sincerely for 
those efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to commend 
Chairwoman MALONEY
and Ranking 
Member COMER for working together to 
put forth a truly bipartisan package to 
stabilize the financial health of the 
U.S. Postal Service and to improve ef-
ficiency and transparency for senior 
citizens and other Americans who rely 
every day on the Postal Service. 
Mr. Speaker, for the past 3 years, 
Democratic 
leadership 
has 
written 
major legislation behind closed doors 
with little to zero input from House 
Republicans and, frankly, almost zero 
to little input from even the commit-
tees that, of course, the Democrats 
control. This has truly been a behind- 
closed-door process that I have seen for 
the last 3 years. 
So, it is finally refreshing to see the 
House consider a bill that was the sub-
ject of a robust bipartisan negotiation 
and that actually went through the 
normal committee process for once. I 
want to say that I hope my colleagues 
across the aisle will make this the new 
normal, as it has previously been the 
norm. 
Mr. Speaker, I also hope the majority 
will continue the bipartisanship that I 
have seen here today and continue to 
work with House Republicans to ad-
dress the serious and pressing issues 
facing American families across this 
Nation. 
For example, thanks to President 
Biden’s open border policy, deadly 
fentanyl continues to just pour across 
our southern border, which is ravaging 
our communities, literally killing peo-
ple in the heartland of this country. 
For example, in 2021, drug overdose 
deaths in the U.S. topped 100,000 for the 
first time in a single year. In fact, 
fentanyl overdoses are reported to be 
the leading cause of death for Ameri-
cans aged 18 to 45. It is past time that 
Congress acts to stem the tide of dead-
ly fentanyl coming into our Nation

largely through our porous southern 
border. The fentanyl that comes—let’s 
just say it—is largely from China. It is 
time we address that issue. 
At the same time, America is in the 
midst of a crime crisis like we haven’t 
seen before, largely thanks to the 
Democrats’ demonization of our police 
in what I view as one of the worst pub-
lic policy positions I have ever seen, 
their push to actually defund police. 
In 2021, at least 16 cities set new 
records in homicides. It is no wonder 
that 64 percent of Americans dis-
approve of how President Biden has 
handled crime. Congress should be 
working to address this crime surge 
and working to back the blue as well. 
Finally, Americans continue to pay 
higher prices to do everything, from 
feed their families, heat their homes, 
and even fill up their gas tanks. In-
stead of doubling down on the failed 
far-left radical policies and out-of-con-
trol spending that actually caused this 
economic crisis, we should be reclaim-
ing 
our 
energy 
independence. 
We 
should be eliminating burdensome reg-
ulations that hamstring our job cre-
ators. And we should be working to en-
sure American families keep more of 
their hard-earned paychecks. 
b 1230 
I want to applaud the bipartisanship 
work that went into these bills. I want 
to applaud the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform and, of course, the Com-
mittee on Appropriations. But there 
are many other pressing issues that we 
can also be working on and should be 
working on for the benefit of American 
families. 
I therefore urge my colleagues to op-
pose this rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania for his 
kind words for the bipartisan leader-
ship and initiative taken in the Postal 
Service Reform Act, H.R. 3076. 
Unfortunately, I have to take excep-
tion to the suggestion that this is 
somehow unique on our part. The gen-
tleman may remember the bipartisan 
infrastructure act that the Democrats 
brought forward but we incorporated 
lots of Republicans in the process and 
we passed it on a bipartisan basis. That 
is more than $1 trillion invested in the 
roads, the highways, the ports, the air-
ports, broadband, and cybersecurity. 
That was something I remember was 
talked about during the last adminis-
tration. I never saw a bill partisan, bi-
partisan, or otherwise come from that 
side of the aisle, but within the first 
year of the Biden administration that 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
act 
was 
moved through Congress. We brought 
lots of Republicans in. I know a lot of 
them voted against it, some of whom 
are claiming credit for it back in their 
districts now. 
But, in any event, this is not new for 
us. It takes two to tango. So I am glad 
that the gentleman from Pennsylvania 
is recognizing what we are doing here, 
but it is hardly unique in terms of the 
leadership being offered. 
Mr. Speaker, speaking of bipartisan 
leadership, I yield 3 minutes to the dis-
tinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY), who 
is the chairwoman of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding and for his leader-
ship. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
rule on my bill, H.R. 3076, the Postal 
Service Reform Act. The Postal Serv-
ice Reform Act has been years in the 
making, and I am proud to say that it 
is bipartisan. 
As we all know, the Postal Service is 
one of our Nation’s most vital and re-
spected institutions. It provides service 
to every American no matter where 
they live, binding us together in a way 
no other organization does. 
What’s more, it is one of the oldest 
institutions in the United States. In 
fact, the Postal Service is older than 
the United States. It has been oper-
ating in some form since 1775 when 
Benjamin Franklin was appointed the 
first Postmaster General by the Conti-
nental Congress. 
Ensuring that this vital American in-
stitution has the tools that it needs to 
prosper and serve the American people 
for years to come is of the highest pri-
ority. This bill does just that. This bill 
would require postal employees to en-
roll in Medicare when they are eligible 
and retire. All postal employees al-
ready pay into Medicare through their 
careers, and the Postal Service has 
paid about $35 billion into the program 
since 1983, and it is the second largest 
contributor to the Medicare trust fund. 
In short, Postal Service employees 
have already earned these benefits. The 
bill would also eliminate the unfair re-
quirement that the Postal Service 
prefund its retiree health benefits for 
75 years into the future, a provision 
that has already passed the House in 
previous Congresses. These two reforms 
would save the Postal Service nearly 
$50 billion over 10 years. 
I want to emphasize that these 
changes do not cost American tax-
payers one single dime. In fact, the 
nonpartisan CBO just last week deter-
mined that this bill would save $1.5 bil-
lion over the next 10 years. 
In addition to these savings, the bill 
includes a provision that will allow the 
Postal Service to work with States and 
localities to provide non-postal service 
in post office locations. This provision 
would allow the Postal Service to more 
effectively serve communities based on 
their individual needs and raise rev-
enue from currently untapped sources. 
It is abundantly clear that this bill is 
good for both the Postal Service and 
the American people. 
I thank Representative COMER
for 
working diligently with me on this im-
portant legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
rule. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for her very lucid re-
marks. 
One other historic breakthrough of 
the post office, I am recalling now, is 
the fact that it was the first Federal 
public institution to provide for the 
hiring of women, African Americans, 
and other minority groups. So I am 
glad, again, that we have got bipar-
tisan support for this really critical 
measure to reform the post office in 
different ways in order to make it via-
ble in the new century. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, rise in opposition to 
this postal reform bill not because it 
does nothing good but because it 
doesn’t do enough. 
The post office is a constitutionally 
authorized yet failed organization. It 
has failed to make a profit. It has 
failed to properly serve the American 
people, and everyone who has a mail-
box knows it. 
I am pleased that this body and the 
ranking member are tackling postal 
issues, but this is not sufficient reform. 
Unfortunately, for that reason, I can-
not support this bill. 
The problems with the post office are 
clear and longstanding. Congress estab-
lished the post office to be a self-sup-
porting organization, and from the 
time it received a $100 billion-line of 
credit, it has simply used credit to 
cover its losses. 
I could agree that prepayment would 
not be necessary if they were meeting 
their responsibility on a pay-as-you-go 
basis to be profitable and to make 
those reforms. In fact, in 2020, under 
the CARES Act, Congress provided $10 
billion in emergency funding, and yet 
in 2020 they lost $18 billion and are on 
course over the next 18 months to lose 
$22 billion. The fact is they haven’t 
made a profit since 2006 as they are 
mandated. 
The truth is the post office isn’t 
lacking liquidity. It is bankrupt, and 
nothing in this bill will make the post 
office truly solvent. It simply wipes 
out and wipes away debts and shifts the 
burden on to taxpayers. The bill for-
gives $46 billion in debts owed by the 
Postal Service forcing the taxpayers to 
pay it. 
Years ago, when I offered real reform, 
reform that would save on a constant 
basis real money, 6, 7, $8 billion a year, 
those reforms, because they lowered 
total labor, were unacceptable to the 
post office even if they were through 
attrition. 
I do support some of the changes, and 
I do support the Post Master’s attempt 
to modernize the post office, but with-
out teeth in the actual organizational 
reforms, the post office will continue

to lose money, and for that reason I 
cannot yet support this bill. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, while I respect my good friend and 
colleague, especially for what he has 
done in the private sector as well as 
the public sector, I do have some con-
cerns. 
I believe the Postal Service Reform 
Act is a strong bipartisan act, and I 
urge its passage. This measure will 
bring increased transparency. It will 
improve operations for senior citizens 
and Americans who use the Postal 
Service every day. It will help this in-
stitution that is critical, especially to 
rural America. 
Again, I have deep respect and admi-
ration for my friend from California. I 
just would urge passage of this, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, a quick note on the gen-
tleman from California’s points. He 
concedes that our bipartisan legisla-
tion does a lot of good things, but he 
says that it doesn’t do everything. 
He makes the point that the post of-
fice is not making a profit. That is 
true. It is not making a profit. Of 
course, our offices don’t make a profit. 
There are very few Federal entities 
that make a profit. That is not what 
government does. Government serves 
the people. We want to be as efficient 
as possible in doing that, but the post 
office serves people from Alaska to Ha-
waii to Puerto Rico to Florida to 
Texas. 
Everybody gets mail, and we want to 
do it as efficiently and as effectively as 
possible, but the point is to make sure 
that we are all connected and that ev-
erybody gets the benefit of being able 
to get their prescription drugs, that 
small businesses are able to send out 
their parcels, that consumers are able 
to receive what it is they are ordering, 
and so on. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON), who is a distinguished mem-
ber of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from the Rules Com-
mittee for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, for as long as our coun-
try has existed, the United States 
Postal Service has played a critical 
role in the function of our country. 
Whether delivering news or bills, 
medicine or ballots, income tax refunds 
or in a few days maybe Valentines, 
Americans—our small businesses and 
our State, national, and local govern-
ments—rely on the post office and the 
essential daily services it provides. 
The famous motto of the Postal Serv-
ice is: ‘‘Neither snow nor rain nor heat 
nor gloom of night stays these couriers 
from the swift completion of their ap-
pointed rounds.’’ 
How glad we have been to see them 
completing those rounds during a pan-
demic which limited our ability to get 
goods and services from other places 
and which limited our ability in some 
cases to get to the polling places. 
While the U.S. Postal Service has al-
ways been essential, in the last 2 years 
it has been even more so, as it has 
helped us all to navigate a highly 
transmissible virus. 
Unfortunately, 
during 
that 
same 
time, we have seen the Postal Service 
struggle to navigate a series of highly 
disruptive policy changes that slowed 
service and financial constraints that 
have threatened its long-term health. 
Over the past 2 years I have heard from 
hundreds of constituents about prob-
lems with the Postal Service, all ask-
ing: What is Congress going to do about 
it? 
This week, I am proud to support the 
Postal Service Reform Act, a bipar-
tisan bill that will improve the per-
formance of the U.S. Postal Service 
and guarantee its long-term financial 
health. 
This bill will guarantee the Postal 
Service’s 6-day delivery standard, im-
prove customer support, and provide 
customers with increased transparency 
about their local service performance. 
Most notably, the Postal Service Re-
form Act will finally end the—unique 
to the Postal Service—statutory re-
quirement 
that 
it 
prefund 
retiree 
health benefits, relieving the Postal 
Service of this onerous and unneces-
sary burden that has jeopardized the 
service’s finances since it was enacted 
15 years ago. 
These reforms which have been en-
dorsed by the postal unions are esti-
mated to save the Postal Service near-
ly $50 billion over the next 10 years. 
The U.S. Postal Service is one of the 
oldest, core responsibilities of the Fed-
eral Government, and so I look forward 
to enthusiastically voting for this bill 
to ensure its continued success in the 
21st century. 
In addition, Mr. Speaker, today’s rule 
also provides for consideration of an-
other continuing resolution to fund the 
government. The House did its job. We 
passed our funding bills on time, and 
Chairwoman DELAURO has pushed her 
Senate counterparts to begin negotia-
tions early so that a funding deal could 
be passed on time. However, Senate Re-
publicans have hemmed and hawed and 
stalled to avoid negotiations because 
they prefer a CR to finding bipartisan 
compromise. We are nearly halfway 
through the current fiscal year. I re-
gret the necessity of another CR, but I 
look forward to a quick resolution and 
a vote on an omnibus funding bill. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I do want 
to add one point to Ms. SCANLON’s ex-
cellent delivery. 
This legislation, the Postal Service 
Reform Act, requires the Postal Serv-
ice to develop an online dashboard that 
will detail for all of us weekly na-
tional-and local-level performance data 
to promote compliance at every level 
with the on-time mail delivery expec-
tations that we all have. 
I too have spent time in a lot of 
neighborhoods of mine in Frederick 
County, Carroll County, and Mont-
gomery County making sure that the 
Postal Service is getting on time deliv-
ery and making it happen. This new 
tool will allow all of us to monitor ex-
actly what is going on in our particular 
communities. 
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from the great State of Texas (Mr. 
BURGESS), who is my good friend and 
fellow Rules Committee member. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, as you have already 
heard, today’s rule provides for consid-
eration of yet another continuing reso-
lution 5 months into the fiscal year 
and not a single appropriations bill has 
been signed into law. 
This time, the Rules Committee had 
less than 2 hours’ notice before consid-
ering the continuing resolution rule in 
the Rules Committee yesterday leaving 
no time for Members who might want 
to offer an amendment or might want 
to come to the committee to speak on 
this CR. 
b 1245 
This is no secret. This has not been 
an easy year for the American people; 
crisis after crisis, and this Democratic 
leadership in this Congress has not 
really led on those issues. We are still 
facing a crisis on our southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 million migrants have 
crossed without documentation since 
President Biden took the oath of office. 
And in response, what did he do? Well, 
he halted construction on the border 
wall, and he tried to eliminate the re-
main in Mexico program except the 
courts wouldn’t let him do that, so now 
they are slow-walking the enforce-
ment. 
At the same time, Ukraine is facing 
down 130,000 Russian troops that look 
poised to invade, and President Biden 
just recently used his waiver authority 
to ease the sanctions on the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline, a direct link be-
tween Russia and Europe for oil and 
gas. If we had been given time to con-
sider this CR, we could have revoked 
this waiver authority and reinstated 
sanctions on the Nord Stream 2. 
Another problem exacerbated by this 
administration is their continued push 
for vaccine mandates. We see it lit-
erally every day on the news. Mandates 
do nothing but drive unnecessary oppo-
sition, and we need to let people make 
an informed choice for themselves with 
their doctor. Taxpayer dollars should 
not be spent on enforcing mandates. 
Finally, it has been nearly impossible 
to get a response back from the execu-
tive branch agency and the reason is, 
we have delegated our spending author-
ity. We have delegated our appropria-
tions authority basically to the Speak-
er’s Office, and as a consequence, no 
Cabinet Secretary feels obligated to 
answer a phone call from a Member of 
Congress from either party. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6617, 
of course, extends funding for the Fed-
eral Government until March 11, 2022.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1028 
February 8, 2022 
We eagerly anticipate the success of bi-
partisan negotiations for the full omni-
bus package. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the rule providing for 
consideration of the Postal Service Re-
form Act. As the only Member of Con-
gress who has a 30-year career as a 
Postal Service employee, I am honored 
to stand here today as the House takes 
action to protect the Postal Service for 
generations to come. 
Few know that the Constitution de-
fines that America will have a post of-
fice service. For more than two cen-
turies, the hardworking employees of 
the Postal Service have lived up to the 
agency’s motto: ‘‘Neither snow nor 
rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays 
these couriers from the swift comple-
tion of their appointed rounds.’’ 
As the agency finds itself losing bil-
lions of dollars, it is time for the Con-
gress to step in and ensure the Postal 
Service can maintain its commitment 
to providing prompt and reliable mail 
service. This bill will provide the Post-
al Service with the critical reforms to 
help address this long-term financial 
solvency. The Postal Service has deliv-
ered the package. Today we have the 
opportunity to deliver the package. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for those excellent 
remarks and note that I think she 
speaks for millions of postal workers 
across the country who are excited 
about this legislation and the reforms 
that it is going to institute. This has 
the endorsement of the American Post-
al Workers Union, the National Asso-
ciation of Letter Carriers, the mail 
handlers, and a number of other orga-
nizations that are invested in this. So 
we are excited about this bipartisan in-
vestment in making the Postal Service 
work for the people in this new cen-
tury. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Across 
this 
country, 
Democratic 
Governors and local officials have 
forced children to wear masks in 
schools. They have done this without 
real concern for the social develop-
mental and emotional consequences of 
their authoritarian actions. These are 
the actions of petty tyrants, people 
who do not care about real science. 
In stark contrast, House Republicans 
have been consistent this whole time. 
We have been fighting for the rights of 
America’s children, and the American 
parent. 
That is why if we defeat the previous 
question, I will personally offer an 
amendment to the rule to immediately 
consider H.R. 6619, the Unmask Our 
Kids Act. This legislation would block 
education agencies from receiving Fed-
eral funding unless schools are open for 
in-person learning and school mask 
mandates allow parents to opt out on 
behalf of their children. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD along with any 
extraneous material immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, here to explain the amendment is 
the legislation’s author, Representa-
tive ASHLEY HINSON of Iowa, my good 
friend. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 
yielding time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand for 
students, to stand for parents’ ability 
to make decisions for their own kids. 
Across the country, children are strug-
gling. Despite being nearly 2 years into 
the pandemic now, tens of thousands of 
students started this year off still 
being forced to learn from behind a 
screen, cut off from their peers. 
Many school districts are mandating 
masks for children of all ages against 
their parents’ wishes. Parents should 
have the option to send their kids to 
school in person and to decide whether 
or not they want to have their kids 
wearing a mask at school. Thanks to 
the leadership of our great Governor of 
Iowa, Governor Reynolds, and our 
hardworking teachers in Iowa, parents 
have had the option to send their kids 
to school in person in class for over a 
year. 
Governor Reynolds stood for families 
by banning school mask mandates and 
allowing 
parents—parents—to 
make 
this personal health decision for their 
own children. That is at the heart of 
this issue we are talking about today. 
Parents should be empowered. They 
should be empowered to make choices 
that impact their children’s physical 
and mental health, their development, 
and their future. 
As a mom, I know why parents across 
the country are standing up and speak-
ing out when they are being told that 
they can’t decide what is right for 
their kids or their family. And it is in-
furiating to watch the very same peo-
ple who push for kids to wear masks all 
day long, and they are bending the 
rules for a photo op or maybe a night 
out on the town. Meanwhile, kids are 
sitting at home instead of going to 
school, and they are interacting with 
their friends in settings that are not 
normal. They are interacting from be-
hind a screen. That is why I introduced 
the Unmask Our Kids Act. 
My bill would condition Federal edu-
cation dollars to schools on those 
schools doing two very simple things: 
one, schools cannot receive Federal 
dollars if they enact wide-reaching 
mask mandates. They have to allow 
parents to decide whether their child 
will wear a mask at school; and two, 
parents have to have an in-person 
learning option. Schools must offer an 
in-person learning option. Our kids de-
serve normalcy. They deserve a chance 
to learn in person. They deserve a 
chance to play with their friends at re-
cess. 
This is about giving parents a voice 
and the final say when it comes to per-
sonal health decisions that impact 
their family. This is about giving 
school-aged kids who have endured so 
much over the last 2 years a chance to 
finally just be kids, to be normal. The 
next generation is too important not to 
fight for. 
When it comes to our children and 
their well-being, we will not cave, and 
that is why this legislation is so impor-
tant. So let’s put politics aside here. 
Let’s put kids first. We should pass the 
Unmask Our Kids Act today. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The Washington Post this morning has 
an article about how a number of Gov-
ernors—California 
Governor 
Gavin 
Newsom, New Jersey Governor Phil 
Murphy, Delaware Governor John Car-
ney, and Connecticut Governor Ned La-
mont—have all announced changes to 
indoor masking requirements because 
of changes of where we are in the dis-
ease. 
I certainly hope that my colleagues 
are not saying that we never should 
have worn masks, although I know 
some of them have said that and some 
of them have opposed masking guid-
ance from the very beginning. Need I 
remind my colleagues that we have 
lost more than 900,000 people, including 
a lot of children, to this terrible dis-
ease. We have faced an epidemic of 
denialism 
from 
the 
beginning. 
Of 
course, the former President of the 
United States was out hawking quack 
medical 
cures 
and 
denying 
the 
virulence of the disease for a long time 
saying it would just disappear at Eas-
tertime. Maybe everybody should just 
be injected with bleach. 
We have come a long way from then, 
and President Biden has led us in an 
aggressive scientific effort, including 
masking where it was appropriate, in 
order to beat the disease, and we are 
making great progress. Now the States 
and localities are able to drop the 
masking requirements. So I see that 
they want to get on top of the wave 
and somehow claim that they are re-
sponsible for that when it was the 
President from their party who pre-
sided over an historically reckless and 
irresponsible approach to COVID–19, 
one that gave us a leading position in 
the spread of COVID–19. 
So in any event, I haven’t seen the 
bill that they have just introduced yet. 
I know that the Biden administration 
has used the post office to ship 500 mil-
lion coronavirus test kits to people 
across the country, which, again, un-
derscores the importance of the legisla-
tion we are really here to talk about 
today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1029 
February 8, 2022 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting 
that my good friend from Maryland 
would say the former President was 
‘‘reckless’’ during the pandemic. This 
is a man who put together Operation 
Warp Speed, one of the quickest vac-
cination programs and one of the most 
effective the world has ever seen. 
If we are talking about numbers, let’s 
just talk about the numbers. More peo-
ple have died in this pandemic under 
Joe Biden than ever died under Presi-
dent Trump. The numbers don’t lie. 
During President Trump’s first year 
with the pandemic, there were just 
over 390,000 deaths and, again, every 
death is tragic. But to say that Presi-
dent Trump was reckless, look at the 
numbers of Joe Biden. Since Joe Biden 
has taken office, over half a million 
people, 500,000-plus people have died. 
So if President Trump was reckless, 
what word would you use to describe 
President Biden? I am interested to 
hear that. But there are two kinds of 
science; there is real science and there 
is political science. The risk of severe 
disease from COVID–19 to healthy chil-
dren is very low. This is real science. 
The CDC data shows that 863 total pe-
diatric deaths related to COVID–19 
have occurred since the beginning of 
this pandemic, which is less than—and, 
again, for the party of science, this is 
real science—that is less than 0.001 per-
cent of all COVID deaths in the United 
States. Many of these children had un-
derlying medical conditions making 
them 
more 
vulnerable 
to 
severe 
COVID–19 
than 
the 
average 
child, 
meaning that many of these children 
died with COVID not of COVID. 
But again, that is real science, not 
political science. Talking about real 
science versus political science, I have 
got a photo of Stacey Abrams. This is 
political science, and here is why. Be-
cause the kids in this photo trying to 
learn, all of them are masked up. Sta-
tistically, these children are at very 
low risk of contracting COVID and 
even lower risk of dying from COVID. 
Again, the stats don’t lie; 0.001 percent. 
The real person in this photo who 
bears most of the risk is a governor-in- 
exile Stacey Abrams who is not wear-
ing a mask. This photo is political 
science. If the mask wearing was re-
versed, that would be actual science. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kansas 
(Mr. 
LATURNER), my good friend. 
Mr. LATURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to oppose the previous question so that 
we can immediately consider H.R. 6619 
which will prohibit local education 
agencies from receiving Department of 
Education funding unless schools are 
open for in-person learning, and allow 
parents to opt out of mask mandates 
on behalf of their children. 
Over the past 2 years, our children 
have suffered academically and so-
cially throughout the pandemic. As a 
father of four young children, I know 
how important it is that kids are back 
in the classroom and free of unneces-
sary and distracting mask mandates. 
Parents, not politicians, should have 
the power to make the best decisions 
for their children. Let me repeat that 
because so many across this country 
and some in this body don’t understand 
that fundamental truth. Parents, not 
politicians, should have the power to 
make the best decision for their chil-
dren. And that includes whether or not 
they wear a mask in school. 
It has been over a year since the CDC 
implemented universal mask mandates 
in schools with little science to back 
up their claim. Studies have shown 
that students can safely return to 
prepandemic 
educational 
settings; 
meaning in a classroom and without a 
mask. 
The House has also appropriated $120 
billion to reopen schools, nearly three 
times what the CDC had requested. 
Yet, we still have school districts 
across our country refusing to return 
to in-person learning or forcing kids to 
wear a mask against their will. 
These school districts should not be 
given any more hard-earned taxpayer 
dollars from the Department of Edu-
cation or any other Federal agency. 
b 1300 
To make matters worse, the same 
elected officials who are implementing 
these draconian mandates are often 
seen disregarding them completely. 
The lengths some elected officials will 
go to gain a political advantage at the 
expense of the well-being of our chil-
dren is truly astounding. 
The reality is, my colleagues across 
the aisle are not following the science, 
and it is damaging an entire genera-
tion’s educational and social develop-
ment. 
It is time we give parents the power 
to let their kids experience normal 
once again. I urge my colleagues to op-
pose the previous question and support 
H.R. 6619. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentleman from Pennsylvania 
doesn’t have to take it from me. He can 
take it from President Trump’s own 
Coronavirus 
Response 
Coordinator, 
Deborah Birx. 
Dr. Birx said the first 100,000 deaths 
were perhaps inevitable, but the hun-
dreds of thousands that came after it 
were avoidable and were the cost of the 
failure to undertake the public health 
precautions that were required. So, I 
would direct him to Dr. Birx. 
Of course, when the virus was out of 
control and President Biden came into 
office, he was doing everything in his 
power to try to reverse the damage 
done by the lethal irresponsibility of 
the prior administration. 
But in any event, Madam Speaker, 
we are here to try to get beyond all the 
wreckage at this point. We are here to 
fund the government through March 11. 
We are here to make these substantial 
reforms to the post office, on a bipar-
tisan basis, that will make the post of-
fice far more efficient; that will guar-
antee 6-day service to our people all 
over the country; that will end that 
uniquely difficult and punitive policy 
of making the Postal Service alone 
have to prefund everybody’s healthcare 
for the next 75 years, which explains a 
lot of its financial problems. That is 
what we are here to do today. 
We are making progress for America, 
and we are trying to do it on a bipar-
tisan basis. It seems strange to me that 
my colleagues would try to pick a fight 
about COVID–19 in this context when 
we are just trying to recover from the 
wreckage left by the prior administra-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
My good friend from Maryland ref-
erenced Dr. Birx. Let’s be honest: Dr. 
Birx is an unelected career bureaucrat 
who has been wrong repeatedly, just 
like Dr. Fauci has been wrong repeat-
edly. 
Although my friend on the left might 
cite Dr. Birx, I can cite Johns Hopkins 
University, which just did a study. Ac-
cording to this massive study from 
Johns Hopkins University—not a bas-
tion of conservative ideology, I might 
add—they found that lockdowns only 
reduced COVID mortality by 0.2 per-
cent in the United States. In sum, 
lockdowns didn’t work at all. 
What is worse is that those on the 
left have failed to take into account 
that the lockdowns actually led to 
more deaths than they prevented, argu-
ably, with drug overdose and suicide. 
But that is real science, not political 
science. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MIL-
LER-MEEKS) to talk about more real 
science. 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the pre-
vious question so that the House can 
immediately consider Congresswoman 
HINSON’s H.R. 6619, the Unmask Our 
Kids Act. 
The Unmask Our Kids Act would re-
strict funds from going to any local 
education agencies that don’t offer an 
option for in-person instruction at both 
elementary 
and 
secondary 
public 
schools. Further, the Unmask Our Kids 
Act would allow parents to opt their 
child out of having to wear a mask at 
school. 
As the mother of two children, I un-
derstand how important it is for all 
kids to be in school, learning among 
their peers. Unfortunately, throughout 
the COVID–19 pandemic, there has been 
a political theater of both masking 
policies and virtual learning, which has 
resulted in K–12 students paying the 
price through learning loss, which is at 
an even higher rate among students 
who come from disadvantaged families. 
Several studies have found that there 
are adverse effects on the quality of

education due to the lack of time stu-
dents spend with their peers, especially 
for students who struggled with school 
before the pandemic. Students need 
and deserve to have in-person instruc-
tion so that they can receive the best 
education possible for their future. 
As a physician and former director of 
public health, I recognize that children 
are at low risk of severe illness with 
COVID and low risk of transmission. A 
recent 
study 
found 
that 
grade- 
schoolers are at a lower risk than vac-
cinated adults. 
Wearing a mask at school can create 
both behavioral and physical complica-
tions for students. A student wearing a 
pair of glasses may have to keep 
defogging their lenses, or a student 
that has a facial tic may have to keep 
correcting their fallen mask. 
As we have seen across the Nation, 
mental health has been a big part of 
this pandemic, and students are not 
immune to this impact. Not being able 
to see other peers or your teacher’s 
face can lead to only further loneliness, 
anxiety, and depression, and the rate of 
suicide in children as young as 9 has 
been staggering. Many young students 
are also unable to learn because facial 
expressions are absent. 
Just yesterday, New Jersey’s Demo-
cratic Governor announced that, begin-
ning in March, the State will no longer 
require students and school employees 
to wear masks. The Governor was 
quoted saying that: ‘‘This is not a dec-
laration of victory as much as an ac-
knowledgment that we can responsibly 
live with this thing.’’ Europe has had 
that policy for almost a year. 
Beginning this Friday, the Governor 
of Delaware, the President’s home 
State, will lift Delaware’s universal in-
door mask mandate, with a lift on the 
school-based mask mandate beginning 
March 31. 
Also yesterday, a medical analyst for 
CNN said that the decision to wear a 
mask should shift from a government 
mandate to an individual choice. 
If a parent and student believe it is 
in the best interests of their health and 
well-being to wear a mask, so be it. Let 
them make that decision for them-
selves. We do not need elite, powerful 
people imposing their will upon our 
most innocent and most powerless. 
Remove the mask. Let students be 
back in school. And vote down the pre-
vious question. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Someone just tuning in right now 
might be a little confused and think 
that we are somehow debating COVID– 
19. We are here to talk about bipartisan 
legislation on the Postal Service and to 
keep the government open until March 
11. 
I would just point out to my good 
friend from Pennsylvania, who I am 
afraid seemed to disparage science on 
our side or the professional credentials 
of Dr. Deborah Birx, who was the 
former President’s coronavirus coordi-
nator; she went to Penn State medical 
school. I don’t think the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania meant to disparage 
her educational credentials, certainly 
as a graduate of Penn State. 
Look, we don’t need the Federal Gov-
ernment dictating to the States and 
the localities what their policies are 
going to be about masking. I just read 
this morning about a bunch of States— 
I think they have Democratic Gov-
ernors; New York, California, Dela-
ware—that have pulled back on their 
masking policies because the virus, 
today, has dramatically subsided. 
Are we going to pass a Federal bill 
every time the virus goes up or the 
virus goes down and tell them what 
their rules are going to be? Come on. I 
thought that we were all champions of 
federalism. But instead, they want to 
dictate it from up on high. 
Remember, what this legislation is 
about—and I wish we could focus more 
on it—is reform of the Postal Service. 
We have bipartisan support now for 
this. I am delighted to learn that it is 
not just the postal unions that I in-
voked before, but we have a bunch of 
postal associations for it. We have the 
American Postal Workers Union, the 
National Association of Letter Car-
riers, the National Rural Letter Car-
riers’ Association, the National Asso-
ciation of Postal Supervisors, the Na-
tional Active and Retired Federal Em-
ployees, the National Postal Mail Han-
dlers Union, the Package Shippers As-
sociation, the Major Mailers Associa-
tion, the National Newspaper Associa-
tion, Coalition for a 21st Century Post-
al Service, Publishers Clearing House, 
American Catalog Mailers Association, 
and the National Retail Federation. 
We have both the workers in the 
Postal Service and then big businesses 
and small businesses across the coun-
try, underscoring the fact that the 
Postal Service remains the central 
nervous system of commerce in Amer-
ica as well as our public life. That is 
something that we should be cele-
brating rather than picking an unnec-
essary fight, which is completely irrel-
evant to this legislation, about what is 
going on at the State and local level in 
other places. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, look, for the record, I would 
bet on Dr. MILLER-MEEKS any day of 
the week over Dr. Birx. She believes in 
the real science, not the political the-
ater and political science that the CDC 
and Dr. Birx speak of. A great example: 
The CDC never even studied the effects 
of school mask mandates before man-
dating masks in school. 
Say what you will, but that is not 
how science works. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. HUDSON), who is my good friend. 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose the previous question 
so we can immediately consider H.R. 
6619, the Unmask Our Kids Act. 
This is critical because, as a Member 
of Congress, but more importantly as a 
dad of a kindergartner, I am frustrated. 
I am frustrated because all throughout 
the pandemic, bureaucrats, mayors, 
Governors, and school administrators 
have all lectured us to follow the 
science. Just follow the science. 
Well, I agree. Thankfully, 2 years 
into this pandemic, we now have 
science behind the mild impacts of 
COVID–19 on children and the impor-
tance of ventilation instead of masking 
to limit spread in classrooms. We also 
have science on how important it is to 
see faces for a child’s development. 
Yet, even with this data, schools con-
tinue to impose mask mandates, in-
cluding roughly 85 of the 115 North 
Carolina school districts. And if you 
break these mandates, you face severe 
consequences. 
Just last Thursday, 12-year-old Lin-
coln Matthews, from my district, de-
cided not to wear a mask to school, 
with the support of his father. Lincoln 
said he can’t breathe in his mask, espe-
cially when he is forced to wear it even 
while running in PE class. However, 
Lincoln was written up and kicked out 
for insubordination. This is wrong. 
What is worse is, these rules appar-
ently don’t apply to everyone. On Fri-
day, just 1 day after Lincoln was 
kicked out for not wearing his mask, 
Stacey Abrams visited a classroom in 
Georgia without a mask while every 
child around her, as you can see, wore 
their masks. As my colleague, Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER, said, this photo is not 
science; this photo is political science. 
Sadly, this is just the latest example 
of politicians who want to control your 
life. They tell you what to do then ig-
nore their own rules. For these hypo-
crites, it is rules for thee but not for 
me. 
Well, I am here to say that the Amer-
ican people are fed up. I am here to 
say, parents have rights. 
So let’s actually follow the science. 
It is time to scrap these mandates and 
give parents the freedom to choose 
what is best for their own children. 
Today, I encourage my colleagues to 
pass the Unmask Our Kids Act and end 
these mandates once and for all. If it is 
good enough for the politicians, it is 
good enough for our kids. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, talking about more science, 
here is some more science: A North 
Carolina study, where my good friend 
resides, conducted before vaccines were 
available, found that not a single case 
of student-to-teacher transmission oc-
curred when 90,000 students were in 
school. That is the real science. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time as I am prepared to close. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to President 
Biden and thanks to House Democrats 
and their far left, radical policies, 
Americans are currently facing a bor-
der crisis, a crime crisis, and an eco-
nomic crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1031 
February 8, 2022 
Despite a lack of scientific evidence 
to support masks in schools, Demo-
cratic Governors, officials, unelected 
bureaucrats, petty tyrants, have man-
dated the use of masks in schools, dam-
aging the educational and social devel-
opment of our students. It is past time 
that Democrats stop prioritizing their 
woke agenda and work with Repub-
licans to address these and other press-
ing issues facing American families 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question; I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on the rule; and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to say a word on behalf of 
Stacey Abrams, who was the target of 
some rhetorical attacks over there. 
There is a picture of her without her 
mask on in front of a bunch of kids 
who did have their masks on, and it 
was being denounced by the speaker 
from North Carolina momentarily and 
also by the floor leader, who didn’t 
have their masks on, standing in front 
of a whole group of people who did have 
their masks on. 
In other words, they were in exactly 
the same position Stacey Abrams was, 
because the rule of reason we have 
adopted according to medical advice, I 
think across the country, is where 
masks are recommended and indicated, 
people wear them unless they are 
speaking. To turn that into a political 
football to denounce a fellow public 
servant seems to be a little bit beneath 
the dignity of this body. 
But in any event, we are very excited 
about our postal reform legislation 
that we are moving through to guar-
antee excellent 6-day service to every-
body, to have an online dashboard so 
we can all keep track of where the mail 
is in different parts of the country, and 
if there are problems, we can address 
them quickly. 
I am glad we have bipartisan legisla-
tion—at least I hope it is bipartisan— 
to keep the government open until 
March 11. 
As for COVID–19 policies, I think we 
should trust the States and the local-
ities to deal with the manifold ques-
tions that come up as we continue to 
address this public health crisis, which 
was, of course, set into motion by a 
President who denied it, avoided it, 
said he would refuse to wear a mask 
even when it was indicated, who got it, 
who had dozens of doctors at his beck 
and call, who flew in a helicopter to get 
himself served. 
Look, we need to get back on track 
in America. That means the govern-
ment has to work for everybody. We 
have got to stop fighting about public 
health. We have got to work together 
for public health, just like we have got 
to work together for the post office, a 
great American institution which we 
improve and we advance today in the 
21st century. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 912 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
6619) to prohibit the Secretary of Education 
from providing Federal funds to a local edu-
cational agency unless in-person instruction 
is available to all students and parents may 
opt out of student mask mandates, and for 
other purposes. All points of order against 
consideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 6619. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
LAWRENCE). The question is on ordering 
the previous question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr.

tion that is commercially sensitive or is exempt

title 5. 
‘‘(2) REVISED
REQUIREMENTS.—The Commis-
sion may, on its own motion or on request of 
any interested party, initiate proceedings to im-
prove the quality, accuracy, or completeness of 
Postal Service data required by the Commission 
if— 
‘‘(A) the attribution of costs or revenues to 
property, products, or services under this chap-
ter has become significantly inaccurate or can 
be significantly improved; 
‘‘(B) the quality of service data provided to 
the Commission for a report under this chapter

lic interest.

written determination as to whether the activi-
ties carried out pursuant to this chapter during 
the applicable year were or were not in compli-
ance with the provisions of this chapter. For 
purposes of this paragraph, any case in which 
the requirements for coverage of costs attrib-
utable have not been met shall be considered to 
be a case of noncompliance. If, with respect to 
a year, no instance of noncompliance is found 
to have occurred, the determination shall be to 
that effect. Such determination of noncompli-
ance shall be included with the annual compli-
ance determination required under section 3653. 
‘‘(3) NONCOMPLIANCE.—If a timely written de-
termination of noncompliance is made under 
paragraph (2), the Postal Regulatory Commis-
sion shall take appropriate action. If the re-

specified by this chapter are not met, the Com-
mission shall, within 60 days after the deter-
mination, prescribe remedial action to restore 
compliance as soon as practicable, including the 
full restoration of revenue shortfalls during the 
following year. The Commission may order the 
Postal Service to discontinue a nonpostal service 
under section 3703 that persistently fails to meet 
cost coverage requirements. 
‘‘(4) DELIBERATE
NONCOMPLIANCE.—In the 
case of deliberate noncompliance by the Postal 
Service with the requirements of this chapter,

based on the nature, circumstances, extent, and

receipts from fines imposed under this sub-

the Treasury.

Regulatory Commission shall issue such regula-
tions as are necessary to carry out this section.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and insert extra-
neous materials on H.R. 3076. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service 
Reform Act, which I introduced along 
with my distinguished ranking mem-
ber, Mr. COMER. 
I am proud to say that our bill, the 
bill before us today, is the result of a 
truly bipartisan effort from the begin-
ning until our time on the floor today. 
We have jointly over 100 cosponsors al-
most evenly divided between Demo-
crats and Republicans. And according 
to the nonpartisan CBO, this bill actu-
ally reduces Federal spending by $1.5 
billion over the next 10 years. 
The administration also supports the 
bill’s efforts to ‘‘strengthen the U.S. 
Postal Service.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include the Presi-
dent’s statement in the RECORD. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 3076—POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT OF 
2022—REP. MALONEY, D–NY, AND 102 COSPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Reform 
Act of 2022. The United States Postal Service 
and its dedicated employees provide an es-
sential public service and the critical public 
infrastructure for the delivery of mail and 
packages to all Americans in every corner of 
the country. The Postal Service provides 
crucial support to millions of Americans, in-
cluding our Nation’s veterans, including by 
ensuring their ability to vote and providing 
access to prescription medications. Further-
more, the Postal Service is an indispensable 
complement to and foundational support for 
American businesses and communities. 
The Administration supports efforts to 
strengthen the United States Postal Service, 
including by providing Postal employees 
with the dignity, fair pay, and employer-pro-
vided benefits they have earned. The Admin-
istration is committed to ensuring that the 
Postal Service delivers the highest quality, 
most reliable service possible to every Amer-
ican. This legislation would advance these 
goals in several ways. 
Under current law, the Postal Service is 
required to annually prepay future retire-
ment health benefits, a requirement not im-
posed on most other public or private enti-
ties. Consistent with the President’s long-
standing commitment, H.R. 3076 would re-
peal this requirement, which unfairly and 
unnecessarily burdens the Postal Service. 
H.R. 3076 would also establish a new, sepa-
rate Postal Service Health Benefits Program 
(PSHBP) within the existing Federal Em-
ployees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), 
that integrates Postal employees and annu-
itants into Medicare. Making these changes 
would improve the Postal Service’s long-run 
financial outlook, without sacrificing qual-
ity, affordable health coverage for Postal 
employees and retirees. The Administration 
is mindful that these reforms would impose 
administrative burdens on the Office of Per-
sonnel Management and FEHBP, and fur-
ther, that there could be potential chal-
lenges with operationalizing Medicare inte-
gration and with ensuring ongoing funding 
to 
support 
administration 
of 
the 
new 
PSHPB. The Administration looks forward 
to working with Congress to ensure that the 
goals of H.R. 3076 are met in an efficient, eq-
uitable, and cost-effective manner, while 
safeguarding the continued stability of the 
FEHBP. 
Finally, H.R. 3076 would establish new 
transparency and reporting requirements for 
the Postal Service and its regulator, the 
Postal Regulatory Commission; require the 
Postal Service to provide semi-annual re-
ports to Congress on the implementation of 
its strategic plan; provide for a public dash-
board using nationwide delivery metrics to 
track delivery performance; and mandate a 
review of the costing of competitive and non- 
competitive products. The Administration 
supports these efforts to improve account-
ability, reliability and transparency at the 
Postal Service. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. The Postal Service is one of 
America’s most vital and respected in-
stitutions. Originally established in 
Article I of the Constitution, for over 
two centuries it has provided service 
across our country to every single ad-
dress whether you are in an urban sky-
scraper or rural family farm. It binds 
our Nation together in ways that no 
agency or organization does, and it 
adds over 1 million new delivery points 
every year. 
This bill is an agreement to fix some 
of the serious problems that have been 
looming over the post office for years 
and threatening its financial stability. 
It is an agreement that was reached 
with input from Democrats, Repub-
licans, the postal unions, the postal 
professionals, and a wide array of 
private- 
and 
public-sector 
stake-
holders. Over 200 different organiza-
tions have come out in support of this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a list of the organizations in 
support of this bill.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, it is an agree-
ment that contains two major reforms 
that together will save the post office 
over $50 billion in the coming decade. 
First, the bill requires postal employ-
ees to enroll in Medicare when they are 
eligible and retire. All postal employ-
ees have already been paying into 
Medicare throughout their careers, but 
not all retirees could or would enroll 
when they reached 65. So the bill sim-
ply ensures that Postal Service em-
ployees can fully utilize the benefits 
that they have already paid for. 
Second, the bill will eliminate the 
unfair requirement that the Postal 
Service prepay its retiree health bene-
fits for 75 years into the future. This 
commonsense change will help reduce 
the burden on the retiree health ben-
efit fund and help it remain solvent. 
b 1430 
And the bill would provide Congress 
and the American people with a whole 
new level of transparency and account-
ability. It would establish an online, 
public-facing 
database 
that 
shows 
weekly service performance informa-
tion by zip code. 
The bill also requires the Postal 
Service to continue to deliver mail 6 
days a week, using an integrated net-
work, ensuring that Americans can re-
ceive their mail and medications on 
weekends. 
The bill also enables our Postal Serv-
ice to increase revenue through non-
postal services, such as selling permits 
to go fishing or hunting. 
I would like to thank my friend, 
Ranking Member COMER, for his part-
nership on this bill and for helping to 
shepherd it to the floor. It has truly 
been a joint effort. 
I would also like to thank Represent-
atives CONNOLLY, LYNCH, LAWRENCE, 
and FOXX, for their work and dedica-
tion and devotion to getting this bill 
done. 
I also would like to thank Speaker 
PELOSI, Majority Leader HOYER, Whip 
CLYBURN, all of whom supported this 
and helped move it to the floor. 
Let’s do the right thing by all Ameri-
cans and pass this bill, and send it to 
the Senate with a large support from 
this body. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this historic, bipartisan bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time.

OF
REPRESENTA-
TIVES, 
Washington, DC, February 8, 2022. 
Hon. CAROLYN MALONEY, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY: I write con-
cerning H.R. 3076, the ‘‘Postal Service Re-
form Act of 2021,’’ which was additionally re-
ferred to the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce. 
In recognition of the desire to expedite 
consideration of H.R. 3076, the Committee 
agrees to waive formal consideration of the 
bill as to provisions that fall within the Rule 
X jurisdiction of the Committee. The Com-
mittee takes this action with the mutual un-
derstanding that we do not waive any juris-
diction over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and that the Com-
mittee will be appropriately consulted and 
involved as this bill or similar legislation 
moves forward so that we may address any 
remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I 
also request that you support my request to 
name members of the Committee to any con-
ference committee to consider such provi-
sions. 
Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of 
this letter into the Congressional Record 
during floor consideration of H.R. 3076. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr. 
Chairman.

TIVES,

Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN PALLONE: Thank you for 
your letter regarding H.R. 3076, the ‘‘Postal 
Service Reform Act.’’ As you know, the bill 
was referred to the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, with an additional referral to 
the Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
due to provisions in the legislation that con-
cern health care, including Medicare. 
I thank you for allowing the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce to be discharged from 
further consideration of the bill to expedite 
floor consideration. This discharge in no way 
affects your jurisdiction over the subject 
matter of the bill, and it will not serve as 
precedent for future referrals. In addition, 
should a conference on the bill be necessary, 
I would support your request to have the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce rep-
resented on the conference committee. 
I would be pleased to include this letter 
and your correspondence in the Congres-
sional Record during floor consideration to 
memorialize our understanding. 
Sincerely, 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman, 
Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, Americans hold the 
United States Postal Service in ex-
tremely high regard, and that is for 
good reason. All rely on it for our pay-
checks, medications, news, magazines, 
and correspondence with loved ones. 
And now, more than ever, Americans 
enjoy the conveniences of e-commerce 
no matter where they live in this great 
Nation. 
The United States Postal Service is 
truly one of our prized national assets. 
But, as we know, the Postal Service 
has faced financial trouble for many 
years. Service delays stemming from 
an unreliable and outdated delivery 
network, a drastic historical decrease 
in mail revenue, and a sustained surge 
in labor-intensive packages, have all 
contributed 
to 
the 
organization’s 
struggles. 
The rise and dominance of the inter-
net has completely changed the way 
people shop, pay bills, and generally 
communicate. It has changed in ways 
that could not have even been envi-
sioned in the 1970s, when Congress es-
tablished today’s independently oper-
ated Postal Service. 
We need to face the music. The days 
of letters alone driving the Postal 
Service’s revenue are not coming back. 
And with this national pandemic, we 
have seen what happens when the Post-
al Service is stressed to its operational 
limits. 
The dual challenges of workforce 
shortages and a surge in package vol-
ume across its delivery network plain-
ly exposed the inability for the Postal 
Service to adapt to modern challenges. 
I stand here today, after more than a 
year of bipartisan work with my col-
league, Chairwoman MALONEY, to call 
for the House to pass the bipartisan 
Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. This 
targeted bill addresses the immediate 
needs of the Postal Service to help it 
succeed into the 21st century. 
H.R. 3076 bolsters Postal Service-led 
operational reforms that are already 
showing success with better revenue 
and delivery performance. 
For example, the Postal Service saw 
one of the busiest holiday seasons ever 
this past year. And even this current 
White House could not ignore the fact 
that nearly 99 percent of consumers re-
ceived their packages on time or with 
minimal delays. 
This was done under the leadership of 
Postmaster General DeJoy, and in the 
face of constant challenges brought 
about by the pandemic and the current 
political climate. 
Coupled with the Postmaster Gen-
eral’s ambitious and comprehensive 10- 
year reform plan are two legislative re-
quests impacting the Postal Service’s 
ability to operate profitably in the 
years to come. 
First, the well-intentioned 2006 legis-
lative requirement that the Postal 
Service prefund the retiree health ben-
efits of all future potential costs has 
proven 
unworkable 
and 
counter-
productive. 
H.R. 3076 repeals this requirement, 
while continuing to require annual 
payments for what is owed to postal re-
tirees. This helps alleviate immediate 
financial 
stresses, 
while 
still 
pro-
tecting the workforce’s earned retire-
ment health benefits. 
Secondly, the Postmaster General 
has sought legislation to seamlessly 
transition the postal workforce into 
Medicare upon retirement, rather than 
continuing as the primary payer for re-
tiree health benefits. 
Congress has told the Postal Service 
it has to act like a business, and this is

not something businesses do. Busi-
nesses offer secondary coverage to 
wrap-around Medicare benefits, and 
that is what Congress should allow the 
Postal Service to do as well. This is 
sensible policy in keeping with the 
practices of private-sector businesses. 
Postal Service retirees have been 
paying into Medicare their entire ca-
reers and, next to the Federal Govern-
ment itself, the Postal Service is the 
largest contributor to the Medicare 
Trust Fund in the Nation. 
Together, these two legislative provi-
sions requested by Postmaster General 
DeJoy are projected to help the Postal 
Service break even in the coming 
years. 
However, I have made it clear that 
Republicans need to see solutions that 
would also allow the Postal Service to 
fundamentally improve its business 
model. Our reform bill is designed 
around the Postal Service’s current 
operational reform plans. 
Additionally, our bill makes sure 
Congress has key oversight tools. For 
instance, our bill establishes a public- 
facing, online dashboard with full local 
mail delivery performance data. This 
will provide necessary transparency 
into the on-time delivery of mail, and 
equip every House Member to conduct 
oversight of mail performance in their 
local communities. 
Congress should not be caught off 
guard as we were in early 2020 as the 
pandemic 
accelerated 
performance 
problems in real time. 
My colleagues should also consider 
what this targeted reform bill does not 
do. Our legislation does not include 
draconian cuts to service delivery, such 
as post office closures, or decreasing 
delivery to residences. 
Our bill keeps the needs of rural 
Postal Service customers front and 
center. For instance, the bill codifies 
the 6-day delivery of mail and pack-
ages, which provides assurance to busi-
nesses and rural communities alike. 
And importantly, our reform bill 
does all of this without taking the easy 
approach of a bailout or increasing the 
budget. In fact, the bill is projected to 
save over a billion dollars of tax funds 
over the next decade, over a billion dol-
lars. 
Chairwoman MALONEY
and I have 
worked closely on receiving the input 
from the Postal Service and industry 
groups large and small, and have come 
to an agreement that we believe will 
have a real impact. I am very proud of 
this product, this bipartisan work. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader of this Congress. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chair for yielding, and I 
want to thank both Mrs. MALONEY, 
Congresswoman MALONEY
from New 
York, the chair of the committee, and 
Mr. COMER from Kentucky. 
There is nobody covering this right 
now. There aren’t a lot of Members on 
the floor. This will pass in a bipartisan 
fashion. But this is a piece of legisla-
tion on one of the most important 
agencies of government, the most im-
portant services to the American peo-
ple, keeping them in touch, getting 
them goods and services and prescrip-
tion drugs that they need, being able to 
pay their bills. 
This bill is a very important bill. The 
interest in it in terms of the public is 
belied by the fact that it is bipartisan 
and that, therefore, it is assumed to 
happen. 
But I tell you, Madam Speaker, this 
is decades in the making. This bill has 
been debated—not this bill, but the re-
forms that this bill achieves, have been 
debated for decades. 
As the former chair of the Treasury 
Postal Subcommittee of the Appropria-
tions Committee, I know full well how 
difficult this process has been, and it 
doesn’t need me to say anything more 
about the specifics of the bill, other 
than to thank Chair MALONEY. She has 
been tenacious. She has been focused, 
and she has been indefatigable in this 
effort. 
Madam Speaker, I want say that this 
would not have been done without Mr. 
COMER, because it is easy to demagogue 
one part of the issue or some other part 
of the issue. But the gentleman work-
ing together with Mrs. MALONEY has 
made this happen, and America will be 
better. The Postal Service will be bet-
ter. Postal workers will be better. And 
the American community that utilizes 
and relies on the Postal Service will 
have greater security and greater serv-
ice. 
So Madam Speaker, I thank Mrs. 
MALONEY and Mr. COMER. 
I thank all of those who worked on 
this bill in the committee, and I urge 
its overwhelming passage on a bipar-
tisan basis. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), who has 
worked steadfastly and been on board 
and had significant input in this bill 
from day one. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Kentucky who has 
done a masterful job, along with Chair-
woman MALONEY, on this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service 
Reform Act. 
The Postal Service is projected to 
lose $160 billion over the next 10 years 
as mail volume decreases and costs 
continue 
to 
increase. 
If 
nothing 
changes, the Postal Service will run 
out of cash in 2024 and plead for an-
other taxpayer bailout. 
This bill, coupled with Postmaster 
General DeJoy’s 10-year reform plan, 
will return the Postal Service to a 
more sustainable path. It provides ad-
ditional transparency mechanisms to 
help hold the Postal Service account-
able for meeting its goals and ulti-
mately lead its management to operate 
more efficiently. 
It also allows the Postal Service to 
choose the most economic reform of 
transportation, rather than using out-
dated rules that are not tailored to the 
modern needs of the Postal Service. 
The Postal Service Reform Act al-
lows the Postmaster General to make 
two financial reforms that are key to 
the 10-year reform plan. It allows for 
Medicare integration and the elimi-
nation of the pre-funding obligations. 
Last Congress, I requested a recorded 
vote on H.R. 2382, the USPS Fairness 
Act, and I voted ‘‘no’’ on that bill be-
cause I believe it is irresponsible for 
the Postal Service to shed its pre-fund-
ing obligations without making needed 
reforms so that taxpayers are not 
asked to repeatedly bail it out. 
Now I am pleased to say the Postal 
Service Reform Act delivers those sub-
stantial and badly needed reforms to 
the Postal Service, such that its fiscal 
stability will be restored. Even the 
Congressional Budget Office notes that 
this bill would save taxpayers nearly 
$1.5 billion over the next 10 years. This 
keeps the Postal Service solvent, and 
eliminates the need for further postal 
bailouts. 
Common ground is illusive in this 
body, Madam Speaker. I am proud to 
say that the bill before us today is 
truly a bipartisan step in the right di-
rection to help the Postal Service ful-
fill its mission for years to come. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
join my colleague, Mr. COMER, in 
thanking Representative FOXX for her 
unique contribution to this bill. She is 
co-chair of the Postal Caucus and 
played a vital role in moving this bill 
to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE), the distinguished chairman 
of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee that has jurisdiction over 
this bill also, and I thank him for his 
leadership on this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, let 
me thank Chairwoman MALONEY. She 
has worked hard on this and has con-
stantly been telling us for months and 
years how important this was and we 
had to get it done. So congratulations. 
The day has arrived.

The U.S. Postal Service, Madam 
Speaker, is one of the oldest and most 
essential American institutions. Unfor-
tunately, it has struggled financially 
for many years. That is why this com-
prehensive, bipartisan legislation is 
important, because it will address the 
financial challenges facing the Postal 
Service. 
A report last year by the GAO found 
that, since 2007, Postal Service ex-
penses have grown faster than reve-
nues, in part due to the cost of bene-
fits, including retiree expenses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1043 
February 8, 2022 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has worked closely with the 
Oversight and Reform Committee to 
craft healthcare provisions in the Post-
al Service Reform Act that both pro-
tect the benefits of retirees and put the 
Postal Service on a better financial 
footing. 
Under the bill, current Postal Service 
retirees will be able to keep their re-
tirement health plans provided by the 
Postal Service and will not be required 
to enroll in Medicare. However, the 
legislation creates a one-time special 
enrollment period for Postal Service 
retirees who are eligible for Medicare 
to enroll in Medicare part B if they so 
choose. 
Postal Service retirees who enroll in 
Medicare part B through this special 
enrollment period would not pay late 
enrollment penalties on their part B 
premium. Instead, the Postal Service 
would pay any late enrollment pen-
alties on behalf of the individual. 
Arrangements like this exist today 
for certain State and local government 
employees. The new special enrollment 
period will make it easier and more af-
fordable for current Postal Service re-
tirees to enroll in Medicare’s com-
prehensive health coverage, and the 
majority of Postal Service retirees al-
ready choose to take advantage of 
their Medicare benefits. 
H.R. 3076 would also require future 
Postal Service retirees to enroll in 
Medicare when they become eligible in 
order to qualify for the Postal Serv-
ice’s retiree health plan. This would 
mean that future Postal Service retir-
ees who are eligible for Medicare would 
have Medicare as their primary insurer 
but also have their Postal Service 
health plan filling any gaps in Medi-
care coverage. This is a common way 
to provide retiree insurance in the pri-
vate sector. 
Overall, I believe this bill will im-
prove the financial health of the Postal 
Service, and it will allow the Postal 
Service to continue providing critical 
services to the Nation and health bene-
fits to its employees and retirees. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank ev-
eryone, 
particularly 
Chairwoman 
MALONEY, for their involvement in this 
effort, and I urge support for the bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. RODNEY DAVIS), the ranking 
member of the House Administration 
Committee. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I do want to reiterate 
congratulations and thanks to Chair-
woman MALONEY and Ranking Member 
COMER. 
I am a little disappointed, though, 
because our colleague, Mr. YOUNG, the 
dean of the House, is sitting right in 
front of my favorite microphone. But I 
will go here. 
I do want to say, this is a great day. 
We see bipartisanship in action, bring-
ing this bill to the floor. 
I have been a strong supporter of the 
Postal Service throughout my time in 
Congress. The Postal Service is a life-
line to many rural communities across 
our country and many right in Illinois’ 
13th District that I am proud to rep-
resent. 
For many families, the Postal Serv-
ice delivers lifesaving medications, 
benefits, and messages from loved ones. 
Its services are critical. That is why I 
have been a leader in supporting it and 
its employees, like the letter carriers 
and the postmasters, who truly are es-
sential. 
Because of the Postal Service’s im-
portance to my constituents, I have 
worked with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to lead on initiatives to en-
sure it is not privatized, delivers mail 
on Saturdays, and retains strict service 
standards. 
The Postal Service keeps us con-
nected in ways electronic communica-
tion and other services cannot. Addi-
tionally, it finishes delivering pack-
ages for private companies in more 
rural regions of our country, like mine. 
I am glad we are here today, voting 
on this vital piece of legislation that 
will provide more funding and re-
sources to our postal employees. 
This bill, importantly, makes the 
Postal Service financially viable for 
generations to come and implements 
efficiencies that will protect taxpayers 
and consumers alike. Postmaster Gen-
eral Louis DeJoy projects this legisla-
tion will save the Postal Service $58 
billion over the next 10 years and cor-
rect the agency’s long-term financial 
problems by 2030. Additionally, the 
Congressional Budget Office estimates 
this legislation will save the Federal 
Government $1.5 billion over 10 years. 
For these reasons, I support this vital 
piece of legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. 
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ), 
the 
distin-
guished chair of the Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of this long-elusive, bipartisan 
legislation that has been years in the 
making. 
Congratulations 
to 
Chair-
woman MALONEY on her Herculean ef-
fort, along with Mr. COMER. 
In the past 2 years, postal workers 
faced historic public health challenges 
to heroically provide a lifeline for all 
Americans. Just as they always deliver 
for us, this reform bill will deliver 
long-overdue reforms to allow our 
Postal Service to thrive. 
No other entity, public or private, is 
required to prefund retiree health ben-
efits for all its employees decades into 
the future. Only the Postal Service 
faces that fiscally untenable mandate, 
and this legislation eradicates that 
burden. 
This reform also codifies 6-day mail 
delivery, which I am proud to have 
long fought for as an appropriator. 
This consensus bill increases trans-
parency; allows other services to be of-
fered to its customers; and expands 
special rates for newspapers, to help 
these 
vital 
community 
watchdogs 
thrive. These are all commonsense re-
forms. 
As we build on it, the next steps 
should require that Members be able to 
conduct oversight at postal facilities 
without prior notice and allow designa-
tion of single ZIP Codes for cities like 
Hollywood and Cooper City, Florida, in 
my district, where assigned ZIP Codes 
overlap jurisdictions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this critical legislation to help the 
Postal Service better serve the Amer-
ican people. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Wis-
consin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), 
who 
also 
serves as ranking subcommittee mem-
ber on the House Committee on Over-
sight and Reform. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I, 
as well, support this bill. 
This is a bipartisan bill, and people 
have to realize it has to be a bipartisan 
bill. I don’t think either party could 
get 218 votes for this bill, and of course, 
the same thing is true in the U.S. Sen-
ate. Therefore, it can’t be a bill for ex-
treme people. 
There are probably some people who 
want to get rid of the post office and 
just see what happens. Those people 
are going to vote against the bill. 
However, this is a bill in part nego-
tiated by our current Postmaster Gen-
eral, Louis DeJoy. I think he has done 
a tremendous job. 
For years, people have said we ought 
to run the post office like a business. 
Now, we have a businessman who 
doesn’t need the job, and he has nego-
tiated a package. 
Admittedly, some people not nor-
mally known to sign have signed off. 
But it is a good package that will save 
money. 
If this package doesn’t pass today, we 
will probably deal with another pack-
age in 2 or 4 years that is not as good 
as this package. 
We are including new machines, 
which will improve efficiency. We are 
going to switch to more full-time peo-
ple, which will result in less overtime. 
We are going to align the distribution 
network, and there will be transpor-
tation savings there. These things may 
not happen in the future. 
I think Mr. DeJoy has done a good 
job. I think we should stand with him. 
I think if we do not vote for this bill 
today, we are really sending a message 
that we cannot vote for something un-
less it is absolutely perfect. 
I do believe there will be a substan-
tial savings over the next few years, a 
savings which would not result if this 
bill would fail today. I strongly encour-
age my colleagues, including my con-
servative colleagues, to vote for this 
bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Virginia

CONNOLLY),

chairman of the Subcommittee on Gov-
ernment Operations. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairwoman MALONEY for her 
leadership, as well as Ranking Member 
COMER. I am also proud as an original 
cosponsor of this bill and as the chair-
man of the subcommittee with juris-
diction over postal issues. 
This bill contains provisions that, 
when taken together, will right the 
course of the Postal Service, returning 
it to solvency and removing undue bur-
dens that have mired it in debt for 16 
years. 
Much of the blame for the Postal 
Service’s 
financial 
struggle 
rests 
squarely here in Congress. In 2003, Con-
gress enacted the Postal Account-
ability and Enhancement Act, requir-
ing the Postal Service to make annual, 
exorbitant prepayments into its retiree 
health benefits fund, a requirement re-
quired of no other entity in the United 
States. These payments kept the Post-
al Service from profitability for years, 
since 2006. 
To be sure, this prepayment is not 
the only issue plaguing the Postal 
Service’s financial posture in an in-
creasingly online and digital society. 
But as the ranking member indicated, 
what this bill does do is takes care of 
that red ink that we are responsible for 
and puts the Postal Service in a posi-
tion to buy time to develop a 21st cen-
tury business model that will work and 
will continue to serve the American 
people. 
We owe a debt of gratitude to postal 
workers who have, every day during 
this pandemic, served every household 
and every business in America on time 
and reliably, in terms of providing that 
lifeline and that one constant in our 
lives that we depend on. 
This bill is going to shore that up 
and buttress that. It represents a bi-
partisan compromise that is long over-
due, and I salute the leadership of our 
committee, our chairwoman and our 
ranking member, in being able to forge 
that bipartisan coalition that allows us 
to address this issue today in a mean-
ingful way and to pass this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. BACON). 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 3076, the Post-
al Service Reform Act. 
The United States Postal Service has 
been part of our society since Benjamin 
Franklin was appointed the first Post-
master General in 1775. However, with 
the ever-advancing digital economy, 
the Postal Service’s financial difficul-
ties are well known in modern times. 
This bill takes the necessary steps 
toward addressing the financial and 
operational issues facing the Postal 
Service and properly updates them for 
the 21st century. A first-class postal 
system is critical for businesses and 
our economy; it keeps 330 million 
Americans connected. 
This bill also seeks to repair the 
Postal Service’s unsustainable health 
and retirement benefits by coordi-
nating an enrollment into Medicare. 
Under current law, the Postal Service 
is required to annually prepay future 
retirement health benefits, an obliga-
tion Congress does not require of most 
other public or private entities. The 
Postal Service is bound by statute into 
this unmanageable system while still 
being required to work like a private 
business. 
Congress tied their hands. We created 
this problem, and now it has been re-
turned to sender. The package will not 
stamp out all the Postal Service’s 
problems overnight, but it is grounded 
in established practices and will help 
deliver first-class-level results worthy 
of the legacy of Ben Franklin. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. DEFAZIO), the distinguished chair-
man of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mrs. MALONEY for getting us to 
this point today, and I thank the rank-
ing member also. 
Postal reform has been languishing 
around here for more than a decade, 
and we are finally there. The two larg-
est elements of this bill—one was al-
ready just mentioned by Representa-
tive CONNOLLY, the absurd prefunding 
mandate that was stuck in at midnight 
in a conference, and no one knew it was 
there. It was back during the Bush ad-
ministration. They were trying to kill 
off the Postal Service. 
It said you will prepay healthcare for 
the next 75 years of employees. That 
means people who weren’t even born 
yet, people who might go to work for 
the 
Postal 
Service 
someday, 
that 
might retire, we are prepaying their 
healthcare. That has been an incredible 
burden on the Postal Service. 
Now, that is going to be fixed. We are 
going to do away with that. That is a 
bill I have carried for many years, the 
USPS Fairness Act. We had, actually, 
277 cosponsors on that bill in this Con-
gress. I am very pleased it was included 
as a key part of reform. 
The other one is to have postal retir-
ees sign up for Medicare like our Fed-
eral retirees. That saves another $23 
billion. 
Those two things alone will put the 
Postal Service solvent into the near fu-
ture, and we will take other steps to 
increase efficiency. 
The Postal Service is critical. They 
will go where the private sector will 
not go, does not want to go. I have peo-
ple who live in the most remote parts 
of my district, very remote. They make 
a living on eBay and selling things. If 
the Postal Service wouldn’t pick up 
their packages and wouldn’t deliver 
their packages with that box rate, they 
couldn’t make a living. FedEx isn’t 
going to go out there; UPS isn’t going 
to go out there. In fact, they dump all 
the stuff about 25 miles away from 
Powers and say: Hey, take this out to 
that little town. We don’t want to go 
out that far. 
It is an absolutely crucial service for 
tens of millions of Americans, and 
today, we are going to ensure its fu-
ture. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage of 
this bill, and I thank the chair and the 
ranking member for their work. 
b 1500 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG), who has been 
a strong supporter of reform from day 
one. 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
we all know the importance of the U.S. 
Postal Service and its core mission of 
prompt, reliable, and efficient mail 
service to all Americans, regardless of 
where they live. 
This is essential in States like North 
Dakota, where even the most rural 
postal customers rely on the USPS for 
the reliable delivery of everything 
from electric bills to essential medi-
cine. 
But for too long, Congress has ig-
nored the substantial problems plagu-
ing the U.S. Postal Service. From de-
clining mail volume to operational in-
efficiency, the Postal Service has been 
stuck with a business model that is not 
suited to meet the needs of the 21st 
century. 
This body has been complicit in al-
lowing 
the 
financially 
independent 
Postal Service to die a slow death over 
the last 15 years. In that time, we have 
seen mail volume collapse by 40 per-
cent; annual losses total more than $90 
billion; and the addition of more than 1 
million new delivery points every year. 
When I was on the floor debating 
these issues last Congress, I said the 
Postal Service does not need a short- 
term bailout; it needs serious reform. 
This bill begins that process. 
H.R. 3076 is complementary to Post-
master General DeJoy’s 10-year reform 
plan and his request to Congress. This 
bill increases accountability by requir-
ing a public dashboard with national 
and local service performance data 
that is routinely updated. It supports 
the delivery of mail at least 6 days per 
week. It requires regular reporting to 
Congress so we can keep on top of the 
Postal Service’s plan and ensure the in-
vestment goals, cost savings, and rev-
enue projections are met. 
It is more important than ever to 
support initiatives that place the Post-
al Service on a path to financial sta-
bility and maintain its self-sufficiency. 
With a current projected insolvency 
date of 2024, delaying postal reform 
today will only make future decisions 
more difficult and more expensive. The 
status quo is simply not an option. 
I appreciate Ranking Member COMER 
and Chairwoman MALONEY coming to-
gether on this bipartisan bill to do the 
hard work of making the Postal Serv-
ice more reliable and sustainable in the 
long term, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill.

York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to

H1045 
February 8, 2022 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), the distinguished vice 
chair of the Congressional Progressive 
Caucus. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chair and the ranking mem-
ber for this amazing legislation. 
To my good friend from Oregon, Mr. 
DEFAZIO, I remember that bill year 
after year after year because the post 
office was given the death penalty. 
That is what happened in the dark of 
night. 
I worked for the post office. Yes, I re-
member sorting the mail in those old 
days. But what I most remember is the 
1 million new delivery points every 
year that the post office adds. While 
others are making a lot of money, they 
go to the rural areas. 
I also remember the letter carriers, 
the rural postmasters, and all the hard-
working men and women who were 
coming to us week after week, day 
after day, and said: We are dying out 
here, and we need to be able to have 
our healthcare taken care of. 
But guess what? The post office had 
to prepay it. No one else had ever had 
to do that. It was one of the highest li-
abilities. Along with that, they were 
required to fund their pension liabil-
ities at a much higher level than the 
rest of the Federal Government. 
To conserve cash, they hadn’t been 
paying since 2012. Can you imagine, 
they stopped paying their bills since 
2012 because they didn’t have any 
money? 
By more closely integrating Medi-
care, USPS estimates it can save $22.6 
billion over 10 years. What a smart 
thing to do. 
Then, of course, the Postal Service 
Reform Act would eliminate the re-
quirement of the prepaid retirement. 
And, then, it would require USPS to 
develop a public-facing online dash-
board. 
Again, the idea is to save the post of-
fice for the American people, save it 
for the workers, and save it because it 
is patriotic to do so. I congratulate 
you. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member 
of the House and the Committee on 
Homeland Security, and as Chair of the 
Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism, and Homeland Security, 
and a member of the Equality Caucus, 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Service Reform Act of 2022. 
Passage of this legislation is ur-
gently needed because USPS incurred 
its fourteenth consecutive net annual 
loss in 2020, and even if USPS con-
tinues to default on mandated pay-
ments, it would likely run out of cash 
to fund its operations prior to 2024. 
Madam Speaker, USPS funds the uni-
versal mail service it provides to near-
ly 159 million delivery points solely 
through the sale of postage. 
USPS adds one million new delivery 
points every year, even as mail volume 
continues to fall. 
This means USPS must deliver less 
and less mail to more and more places. 
In addition, several congressional 
mandates imposed when mail volume 
was at its peak put USPS on the road 
to insolvency. 
USPS is required to pre-fund the 
health care costs of its employees, re-
gardless of whether they actually serve 
until retirement. 
USPS is also required to fund its pen-
sion liabilities at a much higher level 
than the rest of the federal govern-
ment. 
To conserve cash, USPS has de-
faulted on retiree health care pay-
ments since 2012. 
That is why the key reforms in the 
Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 are 
so important. 
First, the Postal Service Reform Act 
of 2021 would require future Postal 
Service retirees, who have been paying 
into Medicare their entire careers, to 
enroll in Medicare. 
Currently, roughly a quarter of post-
al retirees do not enroll in Medicare 
even though they are eligible, which 
means USPS is stuck paying far higher 
premiums than any other public or pri-
vate sector employer. 
By more closely integrating Medi-
care, USPS estimates it could save ap-
proximately $22.6 billion over 10 years. 
Second, the Postal Service Reform 
Act of 2021 would eliminate the re-
quirement that USPS pre-fund retiree 
health benefits for all current and re-
tired employees for 75 years in the fu-
ture. 
No private company or other federal 
government entity is required to com-
ply with such a burdensome require-
ment and its elimination is estimated 
to drastically reduce its prefunding li-
ability and allow USPS to save roughly 
$27 billion over 10 years. 
Third, USPS Reform Act of 2021 
would require USPS to develop a pub-
lic-facing, online dashboard with na-
tional and local level service perform-
ance data updated each week to pro-
vide additional transparency and pro-
mote compliance with on-time delivery 
of mail. 
Fourth, the Postal Service Reform 
Act of 2021 would require USPS to de-
liver both mail and packages at least 
six days per week across an integrated 
network. 
Finally, the Postal Service Reform 
Act of 2021 would allow USPS to enter 
into agreements with State, local, and 
tribal governments to provide non- 
commercial property and services that 
provide enhanced value, do not detract 
from core postal services, and provide a 
reasonable contribution to Postal Serv-
ice institutional costs. 
In addition, the legislation contains 
several provisions that will improve 
the effectiveness of the Postal Service, 
including: 
The expansion of special rates for 
local newspaper distribution to pro-
mote local news organizations; 
A Postal Regulatory Commission 
(PRC) review of cost attribution guide-
lines for different Postal Service prod-
ucts to ensure pricing accuracy and 
better accounting; 
Increased funding autonomy and con-
trol for the Postal Regulatory Commis-
sion to increase its budgetary re-
sources commensurate with its mission 
of regulating the Postal Service, and to 
shield the PRC from government shut-
downs; 
A study on operational inefficiencies 
in Postal Service flats and magazine 
processing; 
Regular congressional reporting on 
Postal Service operations and financial 
performance to enable accountability 
of stated cost savings, revenue, and in-
frastructure investment goals; 
Adjustments to the considerations 
USPS must make when deciding which 
mode of transportation to use to de-
liver mail in order to ensure greater 
consistency and reliability; and 
The consolidation of the PRC’s small 
Inspector General Office into the more 
robust Postal Service Office of Inspec-
tor General. 
Madam Speaker, the Postal Service’s 
unmatched 
network 
and 
Universal 
Service Obligation serves 159 million 
homes and businesses every day, proc-
essing and delivering an average of 430 
million pieces of mail and packages per 
day. 
In fact, USPS often delivers seven 
days a week due to demand and neces-
sity. 
This has been especially true during 
the Covid–19 pandemic as American 
homes, businesses and private shippers 
have relied on the Postal Service to 
meet their needs in these extraor-
dinary times. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this legislation and urge all Members 
to join me in voting for H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Service Reform Act of 2021. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Alaska 
(Mr. YOUNG), the dean of the House. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. COMER and Mrs. MALONEY. This is a 
good bill. 
I have been working on this program 
for, actually, 48 years. I was here when 
they stopped the post office, when we 
used to run it, and we caused this mess. 
You guys are cleaning it up. I want my 
colleagues to know this is the right 
way to go for the post office. 
Now, you may wonder why I am so 
excited about this bill. Try living in 
Alaska when you don’t have any roads. 
Try not having anything but the post 
office. Try to get your medicines and 
all the other things. The post office is 
the key to the communities in Alaska. 
This bill solves all the problems for the 
post office. 
I am proud of the work you have 
done. I want to thank the staff who 
worked on this legislation. It was a 
hard issue because there are some peo-
ple who say: Oh, let them go private. 
Don’t worry about it. 
You can’t run something like this in 
the State of Alaska. Because of our dis-
tances and lack of transportation, the 
post office is the key to our economy 
in our great State. I want to thank 
both of you for the work you have 
done. God bless you.

February 8, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentleman from Massachu-
setts (Mr. LYNCH), the distinguished 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Na-
tional Security. 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chair MALONEY and Ranking Member 
COMER for the great work they have 
done on this bill. 
As the son of a postal worker, my 
mom; as the brother of two postal 
workers, my sisters Karen and Linda; 
and as a nephew and cousin to about at 
least a dozen more, especially Pat Mor-
ris, my favorite, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service 
Reform Act of 2022. 
This landmark reform agreement 
will finally place our most trusted gov-
ernment institution on a path toward 
financial viability. It is the product of 
bipartisan collaboration and meaning-
ful stakeholder input. It focuses solely 
on fundamental reform areas that have 
long been the subject of bipartisan and 
stakeholder consensus. 
To that end, H.R. 3076 repeals the on-
erous mandate in current law requiring 
the Postal Service to prefund retiree 
health benefits years before it is nec-
essary. 
The agreement also integrates postal 
retiree health benefits with Medicare 
to ensure that all postal workers re-
ceive the benefits that they have al-
ready paid for, a total of more than $35 
billion over the last 40 years. 
Moreover, this legislation codifies 
our support for an integrated network 
through which nearly 650,000 dedicated 
clerks, mail handlers, letter carriers, 
supervisors, and postmasters process 
and deliver mail and packages to the 
American people at least 6 days a 
week, even amid a global pandemic. 
I want to acknowledge the tireless 
contributions of our employee part-
ners, especially the unions, in this ef-
fort, including President Fred Rolando 
of the National Association of Letter 
Carriers, Paul Hogrogian of the Na-
tional Postal Mail Handlers Union, 
President Ronnie Stutts of the Na-

Chairwoman 
MALONEY, Ranking Member COMER, 
Chairman CONNOLLY, Representative 
LAWRENCE, 
and 
our 
dear 
departed 
friend Elijah Cummings, who put a lot 
of time in on this, for their great work. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support H.R. 3076. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
I proudly rise today in support of this 
bipartisan Postal Service Reform Act. 
Our postal workers are the reliable 
chain that links Americans and busi-
nesses, from coast to coast. 
This bill improves the efficiency of 
the Postal Service by streamlining the 
transportation network, optimizing the 
workforce to avoid costly overtime, 
and requiring reporting accountability. 
Additionally, it eliminates the re-
quirement that the USPS prepays 75 
years’ worth of retiree health benefits, 
saving $27 billion over the next 10 
years. It also improves customer serv-
ice by requiring 6-day delivery. 
It is time for us to pave a better path 
for our neighbors who rely on and work 
for the U.S. Postal Service, like John 
Byers, who recently retired after 40 
years of dedicated service to my dis-
trict. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to stand alongside our postal workers 
and vote for this bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 min-
utes to the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. LAWRENCE), the distinguished 
co-chair of the Congressional Women’s 
Caucus. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Service Reform Act. 
As the only Member of Congress who 
served an entire career of 30 years at 
the post office before coming to this 
House, I am thrilled to support legisla-
tion that will be the groundwork for 
the Postal Service to continue serving 
America. 
I came to Congress with a promise to 
my constituents and to this country 
that I would fight to protect and to en-
sure that we uphold and make sure 
that our Postal Service is strong. 
Throughout my career, I was a letter 
carrier, a clerk, a supervisor, and then 
moved up to management. I know first-
hand how important the Postal Service 
is. As a matter of fact, I call myself a 
public servant. I know the hard work of 
our postal employees and how much 
this bill means to them and their lives. 
I know that, today, in a bipartisan 
way—how amazing is that to say on 
this floor—we are working to uphold 
our commitment to address the long-
standing financial issues facing this 
agency. 
Every day, the dedicated Postal Serv-
ice workers deliver packages around 
this country. They deliver them to us. 
Today, Congress has the opportunity to 
deliver a package that will take care of 
the Postal Service, one that is estab-
lished by the Constitution, to ensure 
that neither rain, sleet, nor snow will 
deter 
them 
from 
their 
appointed 
rounds. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 3076, the bipar-
tisan Postal Service Reform Act. 
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitu-
tion gives Congress the power to estab-
lish post offices and to make all laws 
which shall be necessary and proper for 
executing that task. Yes, the U.S. 
Postal Service, like the Department of 
Defense, is a constitutionally created 
entity. 
As a lawyer and longtime small busi-
ness owner and publisher of a direct 
mailed newspaper, the importance of 
access to our unique system of uni-
versal mail via the United States Post-
al Service is a game changer. 
Affordable and reliable mail service 
has given small businesses and entre-
preneurs a level playing field that 
would be eliminated if the Postal Serv-
ice were to be replaced by other more 
expensive private options. 
Seniors and vulnerable citizens rely 
on the Postal Service for access to pre-
scriptions. Small businesses and farm-
ers rely on the post office to provide re-
liable and affordable daily delivery. 
Families across America, and espe-
cially rural America, need the Postal 
Service to stay connected here and 
around the world. 
This bill ensures the U.S. Postal 
Service can continue delivering uni-
versal mail services for years to come 
by alleviating financial burdens and in-
creasing transparency and account-
ability. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from the District 
of Columbia (Ms. NORTON), the distin-
guished chair of the Subcommittee on 
Highways and Transit. 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chair and our 
ranking member for this bipartisan 
bill, and I am pleased to speak today in 
support of the Postal Service Reform 
Act. Amongst other good policy, this 
bill would finally get rid of the 
prefunding of retirement health bene-
fits that has unnecessarily marked the 
U.S. Postal Service’s finances in a way 
that other Federal agencies are not 
treated, nor the private sector. 
Under current law, the Postal Serv-
ice is required to prefund retiree health 
benefits for all current and retired em-
ployees for 75 years in the future. This 
is a unique requirement, and I am 
pleased that this bill that enjoys wide-
spread support would fix this. The bill 
amends the 2006 Postal Accountability 
and Enhancement Act to correct this 
accounting problem, allowing the Post-
al Service to save an astonishing $27 
billion over the course of 10 years. The 
accounting problem led to U.S. Postal 
Service showing losses annually of $5.2 
billion since 2007 when the U.S. Postal 
Service, from 2013 to 2018, instead 
would have shown a surplus of nearly 
$4 billion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield the gen-
tlewoman an additional 15 seconds. 
Ms. NORTON. I would be remiss if I 
didn’t take this opportunity to note 
my strong concerns about delayed and 
undelivered mail in the District of Co-
lumbia. Throughout most of the pan-
demic, I have written to the Postal 
Service to repeatedly raise these con-
cerns. These problems at the Postal

Service in the Nation’s Capital and 
throughout the country need imme-
diate attention. 
I thank Congresswoman MALONEY for 
her leadership on this important issue. 
b 1515 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. GARBARINO). 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Service Reform Act of 2021. 
The United States Postal Service is 
in urgent need of reform. The U.S. 
Postal Service provides an essential 
service to the American people, but due 
to losses in revenue year after year, 
the long-term viability of that service 
is in jeopardy. In fact, it is projected 
that the U.S. Postal Service will run 
out of money completely by 2024. 
This bill would institute reforms that 
would save the Postal Service an esti-
mated $46 billion over 10 years. Among 
other provisions, the Postal Service 
Reform Act would require postal em-
ployees to enroll in Medicare when 
they are eligible and to eliminate the 
unreasonable 
requirement 
that 
the 
Postal 
Service 
prefund 
its 
retiree 
health benefits 75 years into the future. 
Additionally, this bill would improve 
service by instituting transparency re-
quirements, 
promoting 
compliance 
with on-time delivery of mail, requir-
ing operation of at least 6 days a week, 
and expanding nonpostal services. 
We cannot turn a blind eye to the 
collapse of our postal system. I urge 
every one of my colleagues to support 
this bill to prevent this. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI) the Speaker of the House 
of Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding, 
and I salute the leadership of Chair-
woman CAROLYN MALONEY and Ranking 
Member JAMES COMER. I thank them 
both for bringing this important legis-
lation to the floor and their deter-
mined leadership to have a bipartisan 
bill, which is really important, and 
doing so, again, in a spirit of biparti-
sanship that would make our Founders 
proud. 
Madam Speaker, 230 years ago this 
month our fledgling Nation took a bold 
step toward the future by formally es-
tablishing the modern United States 
Postal Service, a beautiful thread that 
continues to weave together commu-
nities across America. 
Today, I rise in support of the Postal 
Service Reform Act, which takes long 
overdue actions to strengthen this pil-
lar of our democracy so that it can 
continue to serve our communities for 
decades to come. 
Since our earliest days, when couri-
ers on horseback traversed the Colo-
nies, America’s postal system has been 
a model for the world. 
Indeed, our Founders knew the value 
of a strong Postal Service, enshrining 
it into Article I, Section 8 of our Con-
stitution: ‘‘The Congress shall have the 
power . . . to establish post offices and 
post roads.’’ 
And, when Alexis de Tocqueville vis-
ited in the early 19th century, he was 
in awe of how our Postal Service 
brought Americans together, writing 
there was ‘‘no French province in 
which the inhabitants knew each other 
as well as 13 million men spread over 
the extent of the United States.’’ 
Yet, decades of poor policy decisions 
and chronic underinvestment have put 
this all-American institution on the 
path of insolvency. As was indicated by 
the gentleman who just spoke, experts 
project that USPS will run out of cash 
as soon as 2024; and reduced services 
and added delays would only continue 
and bring harm in every ZIP Code. 
Meanwhile, our Nation continues to 
ask more and more of our postal work-
ers. Today, they deliver to nearly 159 
million 
delivery 
points—imagine 
that—159 
million 
delivery 
points— 
across the Nation, and they add one 
million more delivery points each year. 
And millions of Americans depend on 
the USPS to deliver prescriptions, So-
cial Security benefits, paychecks, tax 
returns, absentee ballots, and more. 
I will just say in the period of COVID 
the U.S. Postal Service was angelic. It 
was delivering prescriptions to our vet-
erans who were in need of those pre-
scriptions, as well as to seniors and 
others. So we thank them for that. 
So this legislation would put the 
Postal Service on stronger financial 
footing while improving the reliability 
of its services while protecting the ben-
efits of employees and retirees. 
The legislation makes bipartisan, 
commonsense provisions that will wel-
come all future postal retirees into 
Medicare, free the U.S. Postal Service 
from the unnecessary requirement to 
prefund retiree health benefits 75 years 
in advance—and we call that a finan-
cial albatross—and improve USPS reli-
ability with new transparency meas-
ures that will help ensure consistent 
on-time mail delivery. 
I have much more on that that I will 
submit for the RECORD, Madam Speak-
er. 
As a mother of five and grandmother 
of nine, I heavily depend on the Postal 
Service for all kinds of things. Children 
write letters to Santa. They still write 
letters to Santa. They do not text 
Santa. Some do, maybe, but the letter 
to Santa is very important. Parents 
sharing graduation photos; friends of-
fering condolences; wedding announce-
ments; whatever it is, it is still the 
duty of the Postal Service to deliver it. 
And servicemembers communicating 
with home is so important. 
This important legislation takes the 
strong step to empower the Postal 
Service to continue its crucial mission 
to improve our lives, touch our hearts, 
and connect our communities. 
With that, I once again want to 
thank 
Chairwoman 
MALONEY
and 
Ranking Member COMER, and I urge a 
strong bipartisan vote for this legisla-
tion. 
And again, even though we are com-
municating electronically in so many 
ways, there is no substitute for that 
personal connection that the Postal 
Service provides for us. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. ROUZER). 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I had not originally 
planned to speak on this bill, but I 
think there are several things that 
need to be underscored. And before I 
get into those, let me say we have all 
had our moments with the Postal Serv-
ice; I certainly have. But this is one 
agency that is specifically prescribed 
by the Constitution. Major reforms are 
always hard, and when we have the op-
portunity to make these reforms, we 
need to take that opportunity. 
Part of the reason why I am so 
strongly in support of this bill is my 
friend Louis DeJoy, who is the Post-
master General. There is no one more 
capable and qualified to serve in that 
capacity. This is a gentleman who is 
one in a million. 
Now is the best time to get these re-
forms passed and get them imple-
mented. If we don’t do it now, it may 
never happen. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI), 
the 
distinguished 
chair of the Subcommittee on Eco-
nomic and Consumer Policy. 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Postal Service Reform Act. I thank 
Chairwoman MALONEY
and Ranking 
Member COMER
for delivering good 
news for America. 
What is this good news? This bill 
eliminates 
the 
retirement 
health 
prefunding mandate. It requires 6-day- 
a-week delivery. It increases trans-
parency and accountability for the 
Postal Service. 
I thank all of our allies who have 
been working to pass this bill, includ-
ing the letter carriers, post handlers, 
rural carriers, postal workers. Neither 
snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of 
night, nor politics or partisanship can 
get in the way of this bill. 
I urge swift passage of the Postal 
Service Reform Act. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in strong support of the 
Postal Service Reform Act. 
As my colleagues have pointed out 
here, this is a long-overdue reform 
measure that will ensure 6-day deliv-
ery, eliminate the prefund mandate 
which, by the way, applies only to the 
U.S. Postal Service. Not a single other 
government agency across this Nation

has been subject to this wildly out-
rageous provision that has signifi-
cantly undermined the financial sta-
bility of the post office. 
Madam Speaker, the very first Post-
master General was someone from my 
hometown of Philadelphia, a man by 
the name of Ben Franklin. His annual 
salary was $1,000 a year. And you look 
at the history of the U.S. Postal Serv-
ice, all the way up to and including the 
time of the COVID–19 pandemic where 
they were up there on the front lines 
serving our communities, serving our 
constituents, making sure that our 
country continued to run. We owe 
them this support to reform these 
measures and ensure the stability and 
strength of our hero letter carriers and 
postal workers across our Nation. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Kentucky has 81⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from New 
York has 9 minutes remaining. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
DANNY
K. DAVIS), the distinguished 
chairman of the Worker and Family 
Support Subcommittee. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I commend the chair-
woman of this committee and ranking 
member for bringing this very impor-
tant bipartisan bill to the floor. 
I associate myself with many of the 
comments that have been made by col-
leagues on both sides, but I also re-
member when Chicago, the third larg-
est city in the United States of Amer-
ica, believed that its Postal Service 
was the best thing it had going. We 
took great pride in it. That has not 
been the case for the last several years. 
And so we are coming to this point 
today where we can restore the viabil-
ity of our Postal Service. I also worked 
at the post office. It was my first real 
job. And we had a saying: ‘‘Clean 
hands, gentle touch, surely we owe a 
letter that much.’’ We will restore 
that. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. 
KAPTUR), the distinguished chair of the 
House Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Energy and Water Development. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of this bipar-
tisan United States Postal Service and 
Postal Service Reform bill. 
By eliminating the unnecessary and 
harmful mandate to prefund retiree 
benefits, and preserving 6-day delivery, 
we are investing in our hardworking 
postal workers and safeguarding this 
vital American service. 
For more than 200 years, the United 
States Postal Service has delivered to 
households and businesses in every 
community on every block in every 
State of our great Nation. What an 
American enterprise. 
Through rain, sleet, and snow, hun-
dreds of thousands of postal workers 
serve America every single day, mak-
ing sure we all remain connected. 
I was a carrier; I know, too. 
The United States Postal Service is 
foundational to our American way of 
life. It is incumbent upon Congress to 
support this cherished and essential in-
stitution for all the generations to 
come. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote for 
the Postal Service Reform bill and vote 
for the United States Postal Service. 
I thank all those who labored for so 
many years to bring this to the floor. 
Congratulations to you and to Amer-
ica. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1530 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I am prepared 
to close, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume, 
and I thank my House colleagues for 
their heartfelt remarks today. 
Madam Speaker, America’s most es-
teemed institution, the United States 
Postal Service, is in trouble. Since the 
1970s legislative reform, Congress has 
expected the Postal Service to operate 
as an independent and self-sufficient 
organization. However, for years, the 
Postal Service has spent far more than 
it has brought in, and last year alone 
lost over $9 billion. Many of these chal-
lenges are beyond the control of prior 
Postal Service leadership. 
The U.S. Congress has legally obli-
gated the Postal Service to provide 
universal mail service delivery. Today, 
that means delivery to over 160 million 
addresses. This is a massive and expen-
sive 
undertaking 
that 
cannot 
be 
glossed over. Additionally, as our Na-
tion’s population and economy con-
tinues to grow, so will the Postal Serv-
ice’s ever-increasing expenses. 
H.R. 3076 does not change this uni-
versal service obligation, but we risk 
having that difficult national con-
versation if we do nothing. The price 
for inaction is a Postal Service that 
will eventually require drastic service 
reductions, especially in rural, remote 
parts of America, or continual tax-
payer-funded bailouts, which no con-
servative and no taxpayer should want. 
Neither are desirable options. 
We have an opportunity to pass tar-
geted legislation to relieve the Postal 
Service of certain financial hardships 
and bolster its ambitious structure re-
form initiatives. 
This moment, with a bipartisan bill 
and bold Postal Service leadership at 
the helm, may not be easily replicated 
in future years. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3036. 
Madam Speaker, before I yield back, 
I would be remiss if I didn’t say my 
grandmother spent her whole career as 
a rural mail carrier. Her name was 
Maitred Witcher, and she had Route 1 
in Red Boiling Springs, Tennessee. I 
grew up with an appreciation for our 
mail carriers and I appreciate all the 
hardworking employees of the U.S. 
Postal Service. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, as we have heard 
many times on the floor today, the 
Postal Service is vital to the United 
States. It is so important that the 
Founding Fathers put it in the Con-
stitution, right there under Article I. 
They did this because they knew that 
the Postal Service would keep our peo-
ple connected and would ensure that no 
matter where a person lives in this 
country, they can receive mail and 
other critical deliveries. 
As the gentleman, the dean, from 
Alaska said, one stamp can take you 
from across the street in an urban area 
all the way to Alaska to some of the 
most remote areas. It is a critical, crit-
ical service. 
Madam Speaker, this bipartisan bill 
will dramatically improve the financial 
situation of the Postal Service—and I 
would say the country that depends on 
it—and enable it to continue per-
forming these essential services for the 
American people. 
We all know firsthand the incredible 
job that the postal workers did during 
the COVID–19 crisis, risking their lives 
to deliver our mail every day. While 
many of us were quarantined and safe 
in our homes, they were out inter-
acting with people every day providing 
the service. At times in my district, 
half the Postal Service was out sick 
with COVID because of the interaction 
that they did to save our lives. 
Just as 9/11 was helped so dramati-
cally by the police and fire, along with 
the healthcare workers, this COVID 
crisis was helped dramatically by the 
Postal Service. They are really the he-
roes and heroines of this crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I share my thanks 
for the support of so many of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle who 
understand and support the necessity 
of these reforms. A vote for this bill is 
not only a vote for the post office, I 
would say it is a vote for yourself, for 
the services that we all receive, for 
America, for our institutions, and our 
values. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter that lists all the Mem-
bers who reached out to indicate that 
they would have cosponsored the bill 
had they had the opportunity to do so.

DEAR
CHAIRMAN
PETERS, 
CHAIRWOMAN 
MALONEY, RANKING MEMBER PORTMAN, AND 
RANKING MEMBER COMER: I want to salute 
your leadership in introducing bipartisan, bi-
cameral legislation to restore the Postal 
Service to financial sustainability while ad-
vancing service and operational account-
ability. You have struck an important bal-
ance in the Postal Service Reform Act, evi-
dent by the impressive list of bipartisan 
original cosponsors. The American people 
and the men and women of the Postal Serv-
ice will be the beneficiaries of this out-
standing work for years to come. 
The Postal Service supports the bill and 
has provided your staff with modest tech-
nical refinements that we hope will be adopt-
ed as the legislative process advances. We 
have provided similar feedback to the Office 
of Management and Budget at their request. 
Postal reform legislation has faltered in past 
Congresses when language is added that 
unsettles the kind of careful balance you 
have achieved in this bill. Accordingly, I 
would commend your collective resolve in 
advancing a reform bill limited to the cur-
rent set of provisions. 
I wanted to particularly comment on Sec-
tion 202, the Integrated Delivery Network 
provision, which as introduced requires six- 
day delivery through an integrated delivery 
network for market-dominant and competi-
tive products. This provision sets forth im-
portant principles that underlie the Postal 
Service’s provision of universal mail and 
package delivery service and that therefore 
benefit the American people. I strongly urge 
you to retain the wording as introduced, de-
spite what we consider to be a parochial and 
misguided effort to modify or eliminate it. 
I have elaborated in an attachment on the 
reasons this provision is so essential to our 
mission. 
I look forward to continuing to work with 
you to advance the postal reform legislation 
you have put forward to serve the interests 
of the American people. Each of you have al-
ready shown yourselves to be exceptional 
leaders to preserve this essential institution 
and its noble mission. Please let me how we 
can assist in your important efforts. 
Sincerely, 
LOUIS DEJOY, 
Postmaster General, CEO. 
AN INTEGRATED NETWORK ENABLES SIX-DAY 
DELIVERY 
I offer the following context regarding the 
merit of the language proposed in Section 202 
of your bill, which would amend how the 
Postal Service’s universal service obligation 
is described in our enabling statute, Title 39 
of the United State Code. Specifically, that 
provision would amend 39 U.S.C. 101(b) by 
adding the following: ‘‘The Postal Service 
shall maintain an integrated network for the 
delivery of market-dominant and competi-
tive products (as defined in chapter 36 of this 
title). Delivery shall occur at least six days 
a week, except during weeks that include a 
Federal holiday or in emergency situations, 
such as natural disasters.’’ 
Initially, the Postal Service took the posi-
tion that it was not necessary to codify in 
Title 39 the requirement to deliver six days 
a week. We argued the ‘‘Delivering for Amer-
ica’’ plan includes at its core the ‘‘mainte-
nance of universal six-day mail delivery and 
expanded seven-day package delivery reach.’’ 
Recognizing, however, that it is Congress’s 
prerogative to interpret and define the scope 
of the Postal Service’s universal service obli-
gation, we understand the policy goal of in-
cluding a requirement to deliver six-days a 
week in Title 39, rather than continuing to 
include it as a rider to annual appropriations 
legislation. In particular, we understand 
that Congress wishes to make it clear in our 
enabling statute that it is appropriate public 
policy, and in the best interests of the Amer-
ican people, that the Postal Service provide 
at least six days of mail and package deliv-
ery as a central aspect of our universal serv-
ice mission. 
This same rationale applies equally to the 
language requiring the retention of the ‘‘in-
tegrated network for the delivery of market- 
dominant and competitive products’’ concept 
with any codified six-day delivery require-
ment. This language properly reflects that 
the unitary postal delivery network has de-
livered letters as well as packages at the 
same time and through the same delivery 
network for well over a century. American 
businesses and consumers benefit from the 
economies of scope and density resulting 
from the delivery of packages across the 
Postal Service’s universal service network, 
which reduces the average cost of every 
mail-piece in the network and leads to more 
affordable prices for both mail and packages. 
These benefits accrue to other shipping com-
panies as well, who can access the Postal 
Service’s delivery network through our Par-
cel Select product. Overall, society as a 
whole benefits from these economies, and 
there is nothing unfair or inappropriate 
about them. Simply put, and just like 6-day 
delivery, an integrated network for the de-
livery of mail and packages is in the best in-
terests of the American people. 
The Postal Service also considers this lan-
guage to provide the appropriate operational 
flexibility. It does not prevent us from struc-
turing our delivery network in an optimal 
fashion, such as by running special parcel 
routes as a supplement to our normal inte-
grated routes when business conditions war-
rant. It also does not inhibit our ability to 
structure our middle mile processing net-
work in the manner that we see fit, as it 
only applies to the delivery of mail and 
packages, not processing. 
AN INTEGRATED NETWORK ENABLES OUR 
UNIVERSAL SERVICE MISSION 
Congress has recognized the importance of 
universal package delivery, and we see the 
inclusion of this provision as consistent with 
that fundamental principle. In this regard, 
the universal delivery of packages is a core 
component of the Postal Service’s universal 
service mission. The Postal Service provides 
affordable, universal package delivery serv-
ices to the American people in all commu-
nities whether urban or rural, and to Amer-
ican businesses of all sizes. This enables full 
participation by all Americans in the e-com-
merce economy. The importance of this pub-
lic service mission has become even more ap-
parent during the COVID–19 pandemic. Now, 
more than ever, there can be no doubt that 
the Postal Service is part of the critical in-
frastructure of the country, providing an es-
sential service to the American people, deliv-
ering packages with life-sustaining medica-
tions and other necessary consumable goods 
throughout the pandemic, and thereby shor-
ing up the resilience of our nation. 
Not only do competitive products them-
selves represent an important service, they 
also provide critical financial support to 
other universal services. Package delivery 
enables us to generate revenue that is abso-
lutely necessary to support the provision of 
prompt, reliable, and affordable universal 
services in a self-sufficient manner, and 
therefore critical to our financial sustain-
ability. Our package products generate an 
increasingly vital level of contribution to 
support the Postal Service’s universal serv-
ice network and thereby ensure the contin-
ued provision of reliable and efficient uni-
versal postal services to all American people 
and to all American businesses. Efforts that 
limit our ability to compete equally or chip 
away at our revenue generation capabilities 
are contrary to the public policy goal that 
we be self-funded while continuing to provide 
essential universal service to the nation. 
Therefore, if Congress believes that six-day 
delivery is critical enough to the universal 
service obligation to codify it in Title 39, 
then as a matter of sound public policy, it 
should also recognize the equally critical im-
portance of the Postal Service providing 
both mail and package delivery across an in-
tegrated postal delivery network. 
I encourage you to retain the language of 
Section 202 of the Postal Service Reform Act 
of 2021 (H.R. 3076/S. 1720) as introduced.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1050 
February 8, 2022 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. And I would again thank Rank-
ing Member COMER for his partnership 
on this widely supported bill. It would 
not have happened without his partner-
ship, and I am deeply grateful. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I urge all 
of my colleagues to support this his-
toric bipartisan bill. We rarely get a 
chance to vote for a bill that helps so 
many people, that actually saves tax-
payers money, that reforms our gov-
ernment, doesn’t cost anything. We are 
just reforming and making government 
work better to serve the people. That is 
what this bill is. It is a win-win-win in 
every direction. 
Madam Speaker, I hope that this 
body would unanimously vote for it 
and send it to the Senate with a mes-
sage that they should pass it as quick-
ly as possible. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
league, Mr. COMER, for his leadership, 
his friendship, and for the long path we 
went through together to make this 
happen. I thank all my colleagues who 
participated in making this happen, 
particularly our Speaker and our lead-
ership in this Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to support this important legislation to 
bolster the United States Postal Service. 
As we all saw in the last few years, the 
postal service is vital to our communities and 
I’m glad that it is getting the attention that it 
deserves. From keeping rural and small-town 
America connected, to delivering Social Secu-
rity checks and medications, to maintaining 
our democracy by ensuring that people can 
safely cast a vote, we have so much at stake. 
Meaningful postal reform affects us all and 
I am happy to support this critical program. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3076, the 
Postal Reform Act. It is my hope that the 
changes in this legislation will help the United 
States Postal Service and its hardworking em-
ployees continue to serve our communities. 
Our communities depend on a strong and 
vibrant Postal Service. The United States 
Postal Service reaches into every community 
of every size across our nation through its 
unmatchable delivery network. Over 600,000 
hardworking Postal Service employees, nearly 
a quarter of them veterans, help the Postal 
Service carryout its obligations and provide 
top quality service to our communities which 
has helped the Postal Service consistently 
rank as one of the most respected institutions. 
My constituents, like most Americans, rely 
on the efficient and timely delivery of bills, par-
cels and medication by the Postal Service. 
And when asked to do more, our postal work-
ers step up. For example, the administration 
recently leaned on the Postal Service to help 
distribute at home COVID test kits, given its 
presence and ability to reach every community 
in our country. It is critical that the House take 
up legislation to help strengthen the Postal 
Service. This debate has been long overdue 
and so I welcome today’s vote. I hope our col-
leagues in the Senate will quickly follow suit. 
The challenges facing the Postal Service 
are well known. The adverse impact of man-
dates imposed by Congress in 2006 Postal 
Reform legislation that have hurt the Postal 
Service. The declining volume of first-class 
mail and associated revenue losses. Policy 
changes initiated by the current Postmaster 
General that has slowed the mail while raising 
mailing costs, a recipe for disaster. 
At the same time, the Postal Service has an 
aging vehicle fleet that becomes more expen-
sive every year to maintain and keep on the 
road. 
The bill before us, while not perfect and not 
addressing every issue, would help put the 
Postal Service on a better path. I fear that 
every day of further inaction or delay on legis-
lation such as the Postal Reform Act would 
only worsen the situation facing the Postal 
Service, its customers, and its employees. 
And failing to act may only lead to even more 
drastic measures and service cuts that will 
only adversely impact the millions of Ameri-
cans and businesses that rely on the USPS. 
For example, some have used the current sit-
uation to push for ill-advised privatization of 
the Postal Service. 
The Postal Reform Act includes provisions 
from stand-alone bills that I support such as 
preserving six-day mail delivery and repealing 
the requirement that the USPS prefund future 
retirement health benefits. And it would pro-
vide more flexibility for the Postal Service to 
offer work with state, local and tribal govern-
ments, to explore avenues to help generate 
more revenues. 
We need a strong and vibrant Postal Serv-
ice that maintains accessible services for all in 
our community. As the most trusted institution 
in the federal government and the cornerstone 
of a trillion dollar plus industry, the Postal 
Service and its dedicated postal workforce de-
serve every effort on our part to ensure it re-
mains a viable and thriving institution. 
I support this legislation and urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House and the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security, and as Chair of 
the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security, and a mem-
ber of the Equality Caucus, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Re-
form Act of 2022. 
Passage of this legislation is urgently need-
ed because USPS incurred its fourteenth con-
secutive net annual loss in 2020, and even if 
USPS continues to default on mandated pay-
ments, it would likely run out of cash to fund 
its operations prior to 2024. 
Madam Speaker, USPS funds the universal 
mail service it provides to nearly 159 million 
delivery points solely through the sale of post-
age. 
USPS adds one million new delivery points 
every year, even as mail volume continues to 
fall. 
This means USPS must deliver less and 
less mail to more and more places. 
In addition, several congressional mandates 
imposed when mail volume was at its peak 
put USPS on the road to insolvency. 
USPS is required to pre-fund the health 
care costs of its employees, regardless of 
whether they actually serve until retirement. 
USPS is also required to fund its pension li-
abilities at a much higher level than the rest of 
the federal government. 
To conserve cash, USPS has defaulted on 
retiree health care payments since 2012. 
That is why the key reforms in the Postal 
Service Reform Act of 2021 are so important. 
First, the Postal Service Reform Act of 2021 
would require future Postal Service retirees, 
who have been paying into Medicare their en-
tire careers, to enroll in Medicare. 
Currently, roughly a quarter of postal retir-
ees do not enroll in Medicare even though 
they are eligible, which means USPS is stuck 
paying far higher premiums than any other 
public or private sector employer. 
By more closely integrating Medicare, USPS 
estimates it could save approximately $22.6 
billion over 10 years. 
Second, the Postal Service Reform Act of 
2021 would eliminate the requirement that 
USPS pre-fund retiree health benefits for all 
current and retired employees for 75 years in 
the future. 
No private company or other federal govern-
ment entity is required to comply with such a 
burdensome requirement and its elimination is 
estimated to drastically reduce its prefunding 
liability and allow USPS to save roughly $27 
billion over 10 years. 
Third, USPS Reform Act of 2021 would re-
quire USPS to develop a public-facing, online 
dashboard with national and local level service 
performance data updated each week to pro-
vide additional transparency and promote 
compliance with on-time delivery of mail. 
Fourth, the Postal Service Reform Act of 
2021 would require USPS to deliver both mail 
and packages at least six days per week 
across an integrated network. 
Finally, the Postal Service Reform Act of 
2021 would allow USPS to enter into agree-
ments with State, local, and tribal govern-
ments to provide non-commercial property and 
services that provide enhanced value, do not 
detract from core postal services, and provide 
a reasonable contribution to Postal Service in-
stitutional costs. 
In addition, the legislation contains several 
provisions that will improve the effectiveness 
of the Postal Service, including: 
1. The expansion of special rates for local 
newspaper distribution to promote local news 
organizations; 
2. A Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC) 
review of cost attribution guidelines for dif-
ferent Postal Service products to ensure pric-
ing accuracy and better accounting; 
3. Increased funding autonomy and control 
for the Postal Regulatory Commission to in-
crease its budgetary resources commensurate 
with its mission of regulating the Postal Serv-
ice, and to shield the PRC from government 
shutdowns; 
4. A study on operational inefficiencies in 
Postal Service flats and magazine processing; 
5. Regular congressional reporting on Postal 
Service operations and financial performance 
to enable accountability of stated cost savings, 
revenue, and infrastructure investment goals; 
6. Adjustments to the considerations USPS 
must make when deciding which mode of 
transportation to use to deliver mail in order to 
ensure greater consistency and reliability; and 
7. The consolidation of the PRC’s small In-
spector General Office into the more robust 
Postal Service Office of Inspector General. 
Madam Speaker, the Postal Service’s un-
matched network and Universal Service Obli-
gation serves 159 million homes and busi-
nesses every day, processing and delivering 
an average of 430 million pieces of mail and 
packages per day. 
In fact, USPS often delivers seven days a 
week due to demand and necessity.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 912, the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of this manager’s amendment to 
H.R. 3076, which makes minor technical 
changes to the bill. We have already 
discussed this bill at length so I will be 
brief. 
The Postal Service is one of Amer-
ica’s most vital and respected institu-
tions. Every American benefits from 
the services it provides. This bill will 
dramatically improve the financial sit-
uation of the Postal Service and will 
allow it to continue providing its es-
sential services for years to come. The 
technical changes made by the man-
ager’s amendment will help ensure that 
the bill is implemented swiftly and ef-
fectively. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amendment, but 
before that, I want to really give my 
heartfelt thanks to the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform, the staff, that 
made this happen, particularly Mark 
Stephenson and Ethan VanNess. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. 
COMER), my friend, the ranking mem-
ber. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the amendment. 
Madam Speaker, as we have worked 
together on the Postal Service Reform 
Act over the past year, Chairwoman 
MALONEY and I strove to fully incor-
porate the legislative feedback we re-
ceived from the relevant agencies. This 
manager’s amendment contains nec-
essary technical fixes to ensure the 
bill’s requirements are efficiently and 
effectively implemented. 
For instance, it ensures that the U.S. 
Postal Service, and not the American 
taxpayer, fully cover the implementa-
tion costs of the Office of Personnel 
Management, Social Security Adminis-
tration, and Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
woman and the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform staff for working dili-
gently with me to make sure this bill 
is done right. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I urge passage 
of this amendment, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
HAYES). Pursuant to the rule, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the bill 
and on the amendment offered by the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed.

H1053 
February 8, 2022 
that we can finalize a framework in 
short order and then work together to 
fill in the details and enact an omni-
bus. 
The American people deserve the cer-
tainty that comes with full-year fund-
ing bills. The transformative invest-
ments an omnibus provides will help 
create good-paying jobs and grow op-
portunity for the middle class. An om-
nibus will expand access to childcare, 
strengthen our public schools, make 
college more affordable, bolster job 
training, and help small businesses ac-
cess the capital they need to thrive. 
And 
it 
will 
rebuild 
our 
public 
healthcare systems after the devasta-
tion of the pandemic. 
b 1545 
An omnibus bill will confront the cli-
mate crisis by supporting environ-
mental protection, land conservation, 
and clean energy development. It will 
protect our national security and re-
store America’s place in the world. 
An omnibus is the only way to 
unlock the full potential of the trans-
formative funding in the bipartisan In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 
accelerating the rebuilding of our Na-
tion’s crumbling roads, bridges, water 
systems, and other critical transpor-
tation infrastructure. 
Of great importance to the people we 
represent, an omnibus would enact 
Community Project Funding that both 
Republicans and Democrats requested 
for their districts, with strong commu-
nity support. From rebuilding local 
health and transportation infrastruc-
ture, helping veterans to find jobs, sup-
porting small businesses, and expand-
ing educational opportunities, these in-
vestments will revitalize our commu-
nities and strengthen them for years to 
come. 
Once we have a framework, I am con-
fident that appropriators will work 
with great intensity to fill in the de-
tails so that we can enact an agree-
ment that is worthy of the American 
people. 
To provide the time to get that done, 
the Further Additional Extending Gov-
ernment Funding Act continues gov-
ernment funding at current levels 
through March 11. 
This legislation is straightforward 
and includes minimal anomalies, the 
most notable of which is $350 million in 
direly needed new funding to address 
water contamination from the Red Hill 
Bulk Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. 
No one wins from additional con-
tinuing resolutions, which is why, after 
we pass this extension, we will finalize 
an omnibus that will deliver for our 
Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this legislation, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, today, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 6617, a short-term con-
tinuing resolution through March 11. 
I am disappointed to be on the House 
floor today to speak on another CR and 
not a full-year appropriation bill. It 
was my hope that, by now, we would 
have finalized our work for fiscal year 
2022. While conversations are ongoing, 
we need more time to complete our 
work. 
No one wants to have a CR, but the 
alternative is much worse. If we don’t 
pass a CR by next week, we could have 
an unnecessary and costly government 
shutdown. I think both sides agree that 
would be disastrous, especially for our 
national security. 
This bill keeps the government open 
for another 3 weeks and ensures the 
continuation of basic Federal respon-
sibilities, such as national defense, bor-
der security, and care for our veterans. 
The bill also includes defense-related 
anomalies that fund the on-time devel-
opment of Columbia-class submarines, 
DOD’s top modernization priority; it 
provides flexibility to counter threats 
like Russia; it equips DOD to address 
the Navy’s Red Hill fuel leak that dis-
placed servicemembers and their fami-
lies; and it continues development of 
critical cybersecurity systems. 
Madam Speaker, I am hopeful that 
this CR will give us time to work out 
our differences and pass bipartisan, 
full-year bills. We will not be able to 
achieve this goal unless we find con-
sensus on spending levels and know 
that controversial policies have been 
dropped. I have been very clear about 
what House Republicans need to sup-
port a final product. We will not sup-
port partisan bills that include irre-
sponsible spending increases or ex-
treme policies. 
Madam Speaker, I urge support for 
the 3-week CR before us, and I look for-
ward to the additional time to finish 
this year’s appropriations process. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the chair-
woman of the Appropriations Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I ex-
press sincere appreciation to our ex-
tremely able chair, ROSA DELAURO, for 
working so hard, along with our able 
ranking member, KAY GRANGER, on the 
bipartisan effort, the latest short-term 
continuing resolution before us. 
Congress holds a bipartisan responsi-
bility to pass a full-year appropriations 
package, and I guarantee you if the 
people on this floor were the ones to-
tally in charge, we would have done it. 
These appropriations bills deliver the 
services the American people need and 
deserve, everything from the defense of 
our Nation to funding vital health 
services and tending to our national 
parks. 
As chair of the Energy and Water Ap-
propriations Subcommittee, our fiscal 
year 2022 bill will continue the progress 
of the bipartisan jobs and infrastruc-
ture bill. 
The bill will invest in clean energy 
technology. It will bolster the Army 
Corps of Engineers’ ability to protect 
our majestic rivers, lakes, and coast-
lines, and improve our dams and ship-
ping lanes. 
What America makes, builds, and 
grows makes, builds, and grows Amer-
ica. These energy and water invest-
ments will create good-paying jobs for 
hardworking men and women across 
our land. 
Too many of these projects are lan-
guishing on the sidelines, waiting for 
these two bodies to do their job. We 
cannot meet America’s objectives if we 
don’t pass these appropriations bills. 
As we make progress on passing 
these bills, we have before us now a 
continuing resolution that will allow 
our Federal Government to continue 
operating until a final agreement is 
achieved. This is a must-pass bill. 
I respectfully ask all of my col-
leagues to join us in supporting this 
necessary legislation and let us con-
tinue the work to build our country 
forward by investing in the American 
people who sent us here to do their 
work. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the chair-
man 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee 
on 
Transportation, 
and 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the con-
tinuing resolution before us. I am 
pleased we came to an agreement, but 
it is only a stopgap. A bicameral, bi-
partisan omnibus bill must be passed 
to fund government for the remainder 
of fiscal year 2022. 
Limping along from continuing reso-
lution to continuing resolution keeps 
us from making necessary investments 
in critical programs, and it halts 
progress on new programs, including a 
number included within the bipartisan 
infrastructure law. 
The infrastructure initiative makes 
historic investments in roads, bridges, 
public transportation, broadband, and 
much more, but without a full-year 
bill, formula funding is going to be re-
stricted to fiscal year 2021 levels, and 
our ability to transform our Nation’s 
transportation infrastructure will be 
limited. 
For example, the newly created Car-
bon Reduction program and the PRO-
TECT grant program to promote resil-
ience can’t be initiated. Restricting 
funding to fiscal year 2021 levels for 
some programs will delay contracts 
and grants. 
A full-year Transportation-HUD bill 
would update our aging transportation 
infrastructure, remedy inequities in 
housing and transportation, prevent 
evictions, and make our infrastructure 
more resilient to natural disasters and 
a changing climate. 
We also spent months, Madam Speak-
er, vetting hundreds of Community

February 8, 2022 
Project Funding requests in a bipar-
tisan manner for well-designed hous-
ing, transportation, and economic de-
velopment 
projects. 
Without 
com-
pleting the annual appropriations proc-
ess, none of these investments will hap-
pen. 
Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of 
this CR today. I urge my colleagues to 
work together to meet Congress’ most 
basic 
constitutional 
responsibility, 
funding our government and directing 
investments for the future. We must 
come to the table with a constructive 
path forward for fiscal year 2022 appro-
priations. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House of Representa-
tives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chair for her strong leader-
ship in bringing the CR to the floor, 
but also for her relentless work in ne-
gotiating the omnibus, what this is all 
about. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the CR that will keep govern-
ment open, meet the needs of the 
American people, and honor the values 
of our Nation. 
This short-term measure will ensure 
that we have the time we need to final-
ize negotiations on a strong, bipartisan 
omnibus 
to 
fund 
the 
government 
through the end of the year. 
As I commend the gracious madam 
chair, ROSA DELAURO, the chair of the 
Appropriations Committee, I want to 
also 
commend 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER for her leadership as well. 
This legislation extends government 
funding 
at 
current 
levels 
through 
March 11. To be clear, this bill keeps 
government open while making vir-
tually no changes to existing funding 
policy. The CR does, however, include 
urgently needed emergency funding to 
help clean up contaminated drinking 
water leaking from the Red Hill Bulk 
Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii. In 
doing so, we deliver a crucial downpay-
ment to help the Navy meet immediate 
needs and keep families safe. 
In order to advance our priorities for 
our country and our communities in 
the long term, Congress must enact an 
omnibus funding package. 
For families, a new full-year spend-
ing package means strengthening pub-
lic schools, protecting clean air and 
clean water, improving public health, 
and ensuring food and consumer safety. 
For workers, it means creating new 
jobs and supporting small businesses. 
For our veterans, it means funding 
for benefits, reducing backlogs for vet-
erans and their families seeking assist-
ance, and meeting the needs of the 
VA’s healthcare system. 
For our national security, it means 
support for our troops, improvements 
to defense readiness and moderniza-
tion, the securing of our cyber infra-
structure, 
and 
stronger 
leadership 
abroad. 
Now that President Biden has proud-
ly signed our bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, it is essential that we enact an 
omnibus in order to unlock billions in 
more Federal dollars for infrastructure 
projects. While they were in the infra-
structure bill, the money cannot be 
spent unless we pass the omnibus. 
This will help us rebuild our Nation 
while reinvigorating our middle class, 
creating millions of good-paying jobs 
improving roads and bridges, ports and 
airports, water systems, broadband, 
and more. 
As the preamble to our Constitution 
states: It is our duty as lawmakers to 
‘‘establish 
justice, 
ensure 
domestic 
tranquility, provide for the common 
defense, promote the general welfare, 
and secure the blessings of liberty to 
ourselves and our posterity.’’ 
Today, we uphold this sacred respon-
sibility in the short term with this 
continuing resolution. With our omni-
bus legislation, which we hope to bring 
to the floor soon, we will take an im-
portant step to honor the vision of our 
Founders. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong bi-
partisan ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. MCCOLLUM), the 
chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee on Defense. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, it 
is unfortunate that we are here again 
today to pass another continuing reso-
lution. I know that the appropriators 
on both sides of the aisle want to get a 
full fiscal year 2022 omnibus done as 
soon as possible. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairwoman DELAURO for her tireless 
efforts to negotiate a bipartisan agree-
ment with the Senate. We have to pass 
this CR today because America simply 
cannot afford a shutdown. 
A shutdown would have a disastrous 
impact on our continuing economic re-
covery. It would diminish our ability 
to fight the COVID–19 pandemic. And 
Europe is facing one of the greatest 
threats since the end of World War II. 
Our Federal Government should be 
sending a strong, unified message to 
Vladimir Putin that we stand united 
with our European allies. 
As chair of the Defense Appropria-
tions Subcommittee, I want to high-
light a critical life, health, and safety 
provision in this CR for our brothers 
and sisters in Hawaii. The fuel leak 
that occurred at the Red Hill Bulk 
Fuel Storage Facility in Hawaii last 
November is nothing short of an envi-
ronmental catastrophe, one that has 
impacted thousands of residents. This 
spill should have never happened. Con-
gress will hold the Department of De-
fense accountable to make this right. 
Today, we provide an additional $350 
million for the Department and the 
services to continue their efforts to ad-
dress this crisis. 
b 1600 
I want to thank my colleagues from 
Hawaii for leading on this issue, espe-
cially Representative CASE, who also 
joins and serves with us on the Appro-
priations Committee. You will hear 
from him later, Madam Speaker. 
You have my commitment that our 
subcommittee will do everything we 
can to stay on top of this. The people 
in Hawaii impacted by the spill deserve 
clean drinking water. They deserve to 
know that their drinking water will be 
secure. It is just one more reason to 
support the CR today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ Let’s keep the government 
open and get the full omnibus across 
the finish line. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ), who is the chair of the Ap-
propriations Subcommittee on Mili-
tary Construction, Veterans Affairs, 
and Related Agencies. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from Connecticut for yielding. 
Here we are again debating the most 
basic function of our democracy: fund-
ing our government. Yet, once again, 
here we are kicking the can a bit fur-
ther down the road instead of passing a 
budget for a fiscal year that started 130 
days ago. 
As chair of the Military Construc-
tion, Veterans Affairs, and Related 
Agencies Subcommittee, I know that 
we need a full annual appropriations 
bill for military construction projects 
that are critical to our national secu-
rity and to make the needed annual in-
vestments in veterans’ healthcare and 
benefits. 
I have been in this Chamber many, 
many times when we came together for 
the good of the Nation, just like we re-
cently did to pass the infrastructure 
bill that was bipartisan with at least 
some support from the other side of the 
aisle. We found common ground be-
cause infrastructure affects every cor-
ner of this great country. But the bene-
fits of that landmark legislation can-
not be fully realized until we enact the 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills. 
Some States are even putting off 
projects until we appropriate funding 
from the full-year budget. The Federal 
Railroad Administration can’t hire the 
staff it needs in order to implement the 
infrastructure bill. New programs to 
reduce carbon emissions and to protect 
roads and bridges against the effects of 
climate change will stall. All our com-
munities in blue and red districts can-
not access these new programs until we 
do our job and pass the full budget. 
Without 
full-year 
appropriations 
bills we risk upending the greatest 
year of job growth the Nation has ever 
seen. We risk knocking down ladders

into our middle class. We risk our na-
tional security. We are close to a fund-
ing agreement thanks to our appropria-
tions leadership. But we need time to 
finish that legislation in full. This con-
tinuing resolution gives us time to fin-
ish that vital work for the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the CR, and I urge 
our colleagues in the entire House of 
Representatives to diligently work to-
gether to make sure we can bring this 
budget process in for a landing. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Hawaii (Mr. CASE), who is a mem-
ber of the Committee on Appropria-
tions. 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, as a 
proud member of the Appropriations 
Committee, I rise in strong support of 
this measure. 
I especially highlight section 165, di-
recting $403 million in emergency fund-
ing to the Department of Defense’s ur-
gent response to contamination of the 
city of Honolulu’s drinking water from 
fuel leaks from our military’s Red Hill 
bulk fuel storage facility at Pearl Har-
bor. 
Red 
Hill 
is 
a 
250-million-gallon, 
World War II-era facility located only 
100 feet directly above the major aqui-
fer providing drinking water to some 
500,000 residents, of which some 100,000 
are military families served by the 
Navy’s water system and are drawing 
from this aquifer. 
Obviously, contamination of this aq-
uifer from Red Hill fuel leaks would be 
catastrophic, most directly to general 
public health, but also to fundamental 
military readiness. And yet, that is ex-
actly what happened last November 
when likely tens of thousands of gal-
lons of fuel did leak from Red Hill into 
the aquifer and then through the Navy 
water system to thousands of homes, 
businesses, and military operations. 
People got sick, pets died, lives were 
disrupted, 
schools 
and 
businesses 
closed, and some 3,500, mainly mili-
tary, families remain displaced. Over-
all public confidence in our military 
remains shattered. 
Since then, our military, with their 
partners in State and Federal Govern-
ment, has focused immediately on re-
mediating 
contamination, 
restoring 
safe drinking water, and returning 
families to their homes. Our military 
has expended hundreds of millions on 
these efforts to date, with hundreds of 
millions more imminent and billions 
eventually required to implement Red 
Hill alternatives. 
This measure’s $403 million of emer-
gency funding is critical to sustain the 
immediate effort to stabilize and defuel 
Red Hill, return our families to their 
homes, and restore public confidence in 
safe drinking water. 
I deeply appreciate the commitment 
of my chair and committee; our Senate 
counterparts; the administration; and 
my Hawaii colleague, Senator SCHATZ, 
to the inclusion of this critical emer-
gency funding. 
Mahalo. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in favor of this bill. 
I would now like to take some time 
to honor one of my committee staff, 
Dave Raser, who passed away suddenly 
on Saturday. At just 24 years of age, he 
worked just as hard as anyone and did 
so with a heart of gratitude and serv-
ice. 
Dave joined my staff as an intern in 
2019 and did such a great job that he of-
ficially joined my staff in 2020. Next 
week, we would have celebrated his 2- 
year anniversary with the committee. 
He always had a smile on his face and 
a joyful spirit that uplifted everyone. 
He truly made a positive impact on ev-
eryone he interacted with. 
On behalf of Congress and the Appro-
priations Committee, I offer our sin-
cerest condolences to his family, espe-
cially his sister, Emily, whom he great-
ly admired and cherished. 
Words cannot express how saddened 
we are at the loss of someone so young 
and so kind. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, first let me join Rank-
ing Member GRANGER in expressing my 
condolences at the unexpected passing 
of 
Appropriations 
Committee 
staff 
member Dave Raser over the weekend. 
Not an hour ago—to my colleague 
and ranking member—I spoke with his 
father and expressed our condolences 
and our thoughts and prayers being 
with him and assured them that they 
are not alone and that they have a 
family here that mourns with them for 
the loss of Dave. 
The gentlewoman from Texas so 
aptly described him and the promise 
for his future. 
Our thoughts and our prayers are 
with him, with his family, with his sis-
ter, Emily, with whom, as my friend 
mentioned, he was very, very close, and 
his friends and his co-workers. 
Again, 
I 
join 
Ranking 
Member 
GRANGER’s sadness at this great loss 
for our committee. 
Mr. Speaker, regarding the legisla-
tion before us, the American people 
need a government funding agreement 
to support working families, expand ac-
cess to childcare, education, and job 
training. We need to be supporting 
small businesses. We need to rebuild 
our public health and transportation 
infrastructure, confront the climate 
crisis, provide care and benefits for our 
veterans, and protect our national se-
curity. That is what we need to be 
about. 
Let us pass this continuing resolu-
tion. Let us complete an omnibus and 
let us get the job done for the good peo-
ple whom we represent. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this latest continuing resolu-
tion to keep the federal government funded 
through March 11, 2022. I commend my good 
friend, the gentlelady from Connecticut, Ms. 
Delaura, the Chair of the Appropriations Com-
mittee for her leadership in helping the House 
get its funding bills passed last year and her 
continued dogged efforts to reach an agree-
ment to finalize FY 22 funding. 
I hope that this is the last CR that this 
chamber has to consider. The House passed 
funding bills provided critical increases for a 
range of education, health care, transportation, 
housing, funding for our veterans, and other 
priorities that cannot take effect under a CR. 
This includes priorities that I was pleased to 
work to secure including additional funding for 
the TRIO program which helps provides serv-
ices to help students not only get to college, 
but graduate. Other priorities include programs 
such as WIC, McKinney-Vento Homeless As-
sistance Grants, and funding for school break-
fast programs, among many other programs 
that this House was able to support in its FY 
22 bills. 
Additionally, enactment of the final FY 22 
funding bills is crucial to unlocking programs 
and funding from the Infrastructure Investment 
and Jobs Act that passed Congress last fall 
with bipartisan support in both chambers. 
The House passed some great FY 22 fund-
ing bills that will help our communities, create 
jobs, and provided long overdue investments. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to work 
with us to get these bills over the line. And 
soon. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with concern regarding our ongoing use 
of Continuing Resolutions. 
While this Continuing Resolution (CR) is 
necessary to keep the federal government 
open in the short term, CRs are an expensive 
and wasteful solution that we should not con-
tinue to rely on. Congress has a constitutional 
responsibility to ensure that our government 
serves the American people effectively. Short 
term funding resolutions hamstring federal 
agencies and our national defense by freezing 
their ability to award grants, sign contracts, 
and do any long-term planning. 
The House of Representatives completed 
consideration of a majority of our full year ap-
propriations bills months ago. The refusal of 
some to come to the table and do the hard 
work of legislating has created the need for 
these short-term bills to avert a shutdown. 
While I am pleased that this CR includes 
additional funds to keep the critically important 
Columbia Class Submarine program on track, 
we should not need to rely on small carveouts 
to ensure funding for important defense pro-
grams that have already been authorized by 
Congress. Other critical programs, such as 
those that ensure children are fed, the elderly 
can afford their heating bills, and everyone 
can file their tax returns, are also stymied by 
short-term funding. 
I urge my colleagues to pass full year ap-
propriations expeditiously and work together to 
ensure that we can complete the Fiscal Year 
2023 appropriations process on time before 
September 30, 2022. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 912, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill.

CONGRATULATING
REPUBLICAN
PLAYERS
ON 
THEIR VICTORY AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BASE-
BALL GAME 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, as you know, this 
past September we played the Congres-
sional Baseball Game. We had another 
record crowd and raised over a million 
dollars for our charities. It was a great 
game, 13–12. 
I am here today to congratulate our 
Republican players on their victory, a 
hard-fought victory. They played hard. 
The lead went back and forth all the 
way to the last inning when they 
scored enough runs to get that extra 
run and beat us. 
Congratulations. We will see you 
next year. I think the game has been 
set for July 28, and we are looking for-
ward to playing it then. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, it was a great game, 13–12. There 
were a lot of runs scored. I think this 
next one coming up is going to be the 
gentleman’s last one after many years 
of managing, and we appreciate what 
he has done. 
He mentioned the charities; the char-
ities were the big winners. Almost $2 
million in charity income was raised 
from the game. It was a great night. 
It is a huge honor to accept this 
championship trophy for not only the 
team but all of the Republican Con-
ference. Being America’s team is not 
easy. And we are officially America’s 
team. We are looking forward to July 
28 where we hope everybody returns 
and we raise more money for charity. 
It is a great honor. We will display 
this proudly. We look forward to seeing 
our opponents again on July 28. We will 
have Greg Steube ready to go along 
with his bat and everybody else we 
have playing. 
God bless all of you, and God bless 
the great game of baseball.

APPOINTMENT 
OF 
MEMBER 
TO 
THE PERMANENT SELECT COM-
MITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair announces the Speaker’s ap-
pointment, pursuant to clause 11 of 
rule X, clause 11 of rule I, the order of 
the House of January 4, 2021, and the 
order of the House of March 12, 2021, of 
the following Member of the House to 
the Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence: 
Mr. GALLAGHER, Wisconsin 
f 
RESTRICT USE OF NO-KNOCK 
WARRANTS 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, it has 
been 342 days since the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act. For 11 months, 
Senate Republicans have filibustered 
this bill, blocking meaningful change 
and accountability to address systemic 
racism and the use of excessive force. 
One critical reform that can wait no 
longer is restricting the use of no- 
knock warrants. These extreme war-
rants too often create dangerous situa-
tions for innocent bystanders as well as 
for suspects and law enforcement. 
That is why the Saint Paul Police 
Department has not issued a no-knock 
warrant since 2016. But the Min-
neapolis Police Department continues 
to insist on using these no-knock war-
rants. 
The irresponsible choice that they 
are making has resulted again in a 
death, the killing of Mr. Locke last 
week, another life cut tragically short 
during a no-knock search, a headline 
that we have become all too familiar 
with. That is why we need Federal re-
forms now. 
The House has done its job. The Sen-
ate must do its job, stop stalling, and 
pass the George Floyd Justice in Polic-
ing Act. 
f 
HONORING JOE SOUSA 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Joe Willie Sousa for being inducted 
into the Georgia Association of Broad-
casters Hall of Fame. 
Joe is no stranger to the Georgia 
broadcasting awards scene, as he also 
earned the Best Pandemic Coverage 
Award. In the face of a public health 
crisis, Joe’s knowledge and expertise 
helped educate listeners on issues of 
supreme importance to them. He devel-
oped this experience as an on-air radio 
personality for several stations over 
his four decades-long career. 
His career began in the 1970s when he 
took a chance to get into broadcasting 
while working at a Winn-Dixie in 
Brunswick. He had planned to attend 
the University of Georgia after grad-
uating high school but got his big 
break when he was introduced to Ed 
Wright and began working on a radio 
show from 7 to midnight. 
After only a year of work, and show-
ing off his natural talent, Joe had 
shown he was more than capable, and 
Wright offered him a spot on the morn-
ing show. The rest, as they say, is his-
tory. 
Since that day, Joe has broadcast his 
personality across the airwaves, and we 
hope to continue to hear from him for 
years to come. 
f 
SAFE, HEALTHY, AND 
SUSTAINABLE TRANSIT OPTIONS 
(Ms. UNDERWOOD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
public transportation that everyone 
can access is a critical, long-term in-
vestment in our communities. 
The bipartisan infrastructure law is 
the largest Federal investment ever in 
safe, healthy, and sustainable transit 
options for millions of Americans, op-
tions like Pace bus that keep seniors 
and our neighbors in my community in 
northern Illinois connected. 
Not only will the bipartisan infra-
structure 
law 
continue 
record 
job 
growth by adding millions more good- 
paying union jobs; it invests $4.5 billion 
in Illinois for critical upgrades and re-
pairs to aging transit infrastructure. 
Last week, I visited the Crystal Lake 
Metra station to highlight the dif-
ference this money will make for us at 
home. Now, Metra can invest in up-
grading ADA accessibility and replac-
ing decades-old railcars with cleaner 
alternatives. 
I am proud to work with the Biden- 
Harris 
administration 
to 
improve, 
modernize, 
and 
expand 
our 
public 
transportation infrastructure.

CONGRATULATING 
HEARD, 
MCELROY & VESTAL ON 75TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
my good friends and community lead-
ers who have been serving my home-
town of Shreveport for a remarkable 75 
years. 
The CPA firm of Heard, McElroy & 
Vestal has been an integral part of our 
community since 1946. In fact, founding 
partner Charles McElroy served as one 
of the first chairmen of the Louisiana 
Certified Public Accountants. 
From the very beginning, the firm 
has established itself as a pillar of 
trust, integrity, and competence. Their 
firm is now one of the largest public 
accounting groups in northwest Lou-
isiana. 
This firm and its over 100 employees 
have worked faithfully for the people 
of Louisiana every day, and they have 
continued to be a cornerstone for our 
region. We are blessed to have their 
mission of accounting excellence and 
commitment to integrity as a part of 
our community. 
Thank you to my friends for serving 
so well for all of these years, and happy 
75th anniversary.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
TOM BRADY 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the career of 
Tom Brady. 
As the Congressman for Foxborough, 
Massachusetts, I represent the home of 
the New England Patriots. For 20 of his 
22 seasons in the National Football 
League, Mr. Brady was a Patriot. He 
brought pride and six Super Bowl vic-
tories to my district and to the fans of 
New England. 
Mr. Brady embodies excellence. He is 
the greatest football player of all time, 
and his final MVP-worthy season is an 
indication that he was still getting bet-
ter when he retired. 
He won 35 playoff games throughout 
his career. That is more than double 
the second-place quarterback. Even 
down by 25 points with little more than 
15 minutes on the clock in the biggest 
game, he never gave up on his team. 
Indeed, teamwork was Tom Brady’s 
top talent. He elevated others through 
his team-first ethic and his competi-
tive drive. From the sixth round to 
seven Super Bowls, the GOAT was al-
ways focused on the team, not himself. 
On behalf of two decades of Foxboro 
Faithful, I thank Tom Brady for the 
memories.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ANDREW 
SPYROW 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of a young man in my district. 
On February 1, Andrew Spyrow of 
Bettendorf passed away after a nearly 
4-year battle with brain cancer. 
Andrew was a lifelong native of 
Bettendorf, graduating from Our Lady 
of 
Lourdes 
and 
Assumption 
High 
School, where he developed many life-
long friendships. He loved playing 
sports and running, participating in 
several marathons across the country. 
I first met Andrew in 2014 when he 
volunteered and worked at the RNC 
victory office in Bettendorf. 
Andrew was a devoted husband, son, 
and father. After his cancer diagnosis, 
Andrew built a beautiful family. He 
married his best friend and love of his 
life, Mary. They had two beautiful chil-
dren, Audrey and Oliver. 
No matter what was happening in his 
life, Andrew always put the needs of 
others first. Even when he was fighting 
cancer, he always made sure to ask 
how others were doing, never com-
plaining about his diagnosis. 
Andrew’s family, friends, and his 
RNC friends are in our prayers during 
this difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING MOTHER HATTIE 
WHITE’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate Mother Hattie White, a 
longtime resident of Southwest De-
troit, in Michigan 13 District Strong, 
on the occasion of her 100th birthday. 
Mother Hattie White was born on 
February 23, 1922, in Alabama and later 
moved to River Rouge, Michigan. She 
married the love of her life, Albert 
James White, in 1946. They were mar-
ried for 52 years and raised their seven 
children in River Rouge and Southwest 
Detroit neighborhoods with love and 
instilling an ethic of responsibility and 
kindness toward others. 
In 1967, Mother White and her hus-
band started a community church, 
Love Joy Missionary Baptist Church, 
in River Rouge, which cemented her 
role as a matriarch of our community. 
Mother White shines bright in the 
community and has brought so much 
joy to her family, friends, and neigh-
bors. 
Please join me in wishing her a 
happy 100th birthday.

FENTANYL OVERDOSES 
SKYROCKETED IN 2021 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, in 2021, 
U.S. drug overdoses due to fentanyl 
skyrocketed, and it is now reported to 
be the leading cause of death for Amer-
icans aged 18 to 45. The leading cause 
of death for Americans between 18 and 
45 is imported fentanyl, mostly coming 
across our open southern border. 
Instead of combating this epidemic 
by prosecuting drug traffickers or ban-
ning molecularly altered fentanyl sub-
stances, the Biden administration is 
making America’s drug problem worse 
by actually putting crack pipes into 
the hands of users—crack pipes distrib-
uted by the U.S. Government into the 
hands of drug users. Yes. 
This has been already modeled in San 
Francisco, so I guess we want to do the 
Californication of the rest of the coun-
try with these crazy ideas coming from 
the Biden administration. Boy, we have 
gone from just don’t do it to, hey, just 
hand it all out. 
It is unbelievable that this is a policy 
at a time of drug problems in this 
country skyrocketing, harm coming to 
people, and the Biden administration 
wants to hand out free crack pipes in 
the name, I guess, of racial equity. Un-
believable. 
f 
CRACK PIPE DISTRIBUTION BY 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I was just 
listening to Congressman LAMALFA 
from California, and I couldn’t agree 
with him more. 
Here we are, in the United States, 
where crime is skyrocketing. Fentanyl 
is 
crossing 
the 
border 
in 
record 
amounts and is the number one cause 
of death for ages 18 through 45. 
Here, today, I see this headline. I just 
googled it and came up with this one 
from blackenterprise.com. The head-
line says: ‘‘Biden administration to 
fund the distribution of crack pipes and 
syringes to promote ‘racial equity.’ ’’ 
‘‘On Monday, applications closed for 
the Biden administration’s new $30 mil-
lion grant program to provide crack 
pipes and ‘smoking kits’ to promote 
‘racial equity.’ ’’ 
Are you kidding me? Our crime is ris-
ing, and this is what the Biden admin-
istration thinks is the priority? It is 
nuts.

NFL’S LACK OF RESPONSE TO 
RACISM 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
many of our jurisdictional committees 
have oversight over the major league 
sports teams, from baseball to basket-
ball to football. 
As a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I have been engaged with my 
committee in the oversight of the Na-
tional Football League. In fact, I re-
member more than a decade ago we 
were the first committee to deal with 
brain concussions and the lack of re-
sponse by the NFL to the players. 
Today, I rise for the lack of response 
to racism and racial discrimination in 
the NFL. I take note of the lawsuit 
filed by Coach Brian Flores and would 
hope that the words, ‘‘it is without 
merit’’ will not stand. 
I believe it is important, with the 
number of minority players versus the 
number of coaches to that in terms of 
statistics, that we address the seeming 
appearance of racial discrimination in 
the NFL. I think it is important to re-
assess the Rooney rule to give a cri-
teria for how coaches are selected, so 
mistakes like the coach from Boston 
sending the wrong notice that ‘‘you 
have been hired’’ to someone else 
would not happen. 
To Mr. Goodell and the owners, let’s 
work together, let’s get the teams to 
look like America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1062 
February 8, 2022 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the sub-
ject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, this evening we will have Re-
publican Members from across this 
country to address the multiple crises 
that are facing our country, whether it 
is the economic crisis, the crime crisis, 
the energy crisis, the border crisis, the 
foreign policy crisis, or now the related 
issue of the staggering and ongoing cri-
sis of fentanyl, a scourge upon this 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield first to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. GRIFFITH) to 
address this issue. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Speaker, in 2020, 
my State of Virginia hit a tragic mile-
stone: Fatal drug overdoses hit an all- 
time high of 2,309. Fentanyl and its 
analogs caused or contributed to 71.8 
percent of those deaths. The statistics 
we have for 2021 indicate it may sur-
pass that heartbreaking number of 
overdose deaths. 
We have tools at our disposal to re-
duce the availability of illicit sub-
stances such as fentanyl and meth and, 
in turn, prevent overdose deaths, but 
they are not being used. Cartels are 
taking components of fentanyl from 
China, manufacturing it in Mexico, and 
smuggling it across the border. 
In fiscal year 2021, fentanyl seizures 
by U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
increased by 134 percent, but the Biden 
administration is weakening our coun-
try’s ability to secure its own border, 
allowing not only more illegal immi-
gration, but smuggling of deadly drugs. 
Meanwhile, 
fentanyl-related 
sub-
stances have only temporarily been 
listed as a schedule I drug, with exten-
sions passed every few months, includ-
ing today we extended it another 3 
weeks, but not a permanent sched-
uling. 
To correct this problem, I have intro-
duced the HALT Fentanyl Act with 
Congressman BOB LATTA of Ohio. It 
would permanently schedule fentanyl- 
related substances. But our bill doesn’t 
stop there. It streamlines research on 
fentanyl analogs so we can better un-
derstand the effects of these sub-
stances. 
At a recent hearing of the Sub-
committee on Health, we heard testi-
mony there are as many as 4,800 
fentanyl analogs. We have data on 
fewer than 30 of them; in other words, 
fewer than 1 percent of them. 
Most of the fentanyl-related sub-
stances we have data on are dangerous, 
but some are inert and may even have 
properties that block opioid addiction. 
We simply need to know more. 
Our bill makes room for researchers, 
not just at Federal agencies, but across 
research institutions, to get to work. I 
believe our bill would save lives. House 
Democrats should help us send it to the 
President’s desk. 
But this bill alone will not solve the 
problem. It helps, but it will not solve 
the problem. We have to use all the 
tools available to us. 
We need to increase the number of 
border agents that we have, particu-
larly on the southern border. 
We need to give them the tools they 
need. 
We need to give them more drones for 
electronic surveillance in the air. 
We need to give them more dogs to 
help them figure out what is going on, 
to sniff out the drugs when they can. It 
is coming across in small amounts. 
Here you see it, 2 milligrams, a lethal 
dose for most Americans, and there it 
is compared to a penny. They need 
more dogs at the border. 
They need more horses because some 
of that terrain is not suitable for 
motor vehicles. 
And last but not least, Mr. Speaker, 
we need to finish building the wall. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I could not have said it better 
myself. I thank my friend for those 
comments. 
Mr. Speaker, what Mr. GRIFFITH is 
explaining there is the magnitude of 
this crisis, and I have a number of col-
leagues here tonight who will speak to 
it. Illegal drug overdoses recently be-
came the leading cause of death for 
Americans age 18–45; the leading cause 
of death. Today in America illegal drug 
overdoses are killing more people at 
this age demographic than car acci-
dents, obviously, than cancer, more 
than COVID. In my home State of Lou-
isiana alone, opioid deaths increased in 
2021 by 40 percent; 40 percent in one 
year; mostly driven by an increase in 
illicit fentanyl. 
What is fentanyl? Fentanyl is this 
synthetic opioid that is 80 to 100 times 
stronger than morphine. It is created 
with chemicals shipped from China to 
Mexico. It is trafficked across our 
southern border. Its potency means the 
smallest amount, even to fit on the tip 
of a pencil, is considered a lethal dose, 
and now it is fueling one of the worst 
drug epidemics in American history. 
Mr. Speaker, the Biden administra-
tion’s response has been nothing, pas-
sivity. They have been passive about 
securing our border, the entry point for 
all these drugs coming into our com-
munities. 
They 
have 
been 
passive 
about 
prosecuting 
drug 
offenders. 
Many Democrat-led jurisdictions are 
lowering 
felony 
offenses 
to 
mis-
demeanors. They have been passive 
about 
preventing 
drug 
abuse. 
The 
Democrats’ American Rescue Plan, so- 
called, even includes a provision, as 
you have already heard tonight, and 
you will hear it more, to distribute 
drug paraphernalia at taxpayers’ ex-
pense. It is unbelievable. 
Mr. Speaker, fentanyl deaths are cer-
tain to increase unless we act with the 
same resolve that we have used to at-
tack other less-deadly threats. If the 
Biden 
administration 
were 
serious 
about 
addressing 
this 
crisis, 
they 
would start by securing our turnstile 
at the southern border. It is time for 
the Democrats in charge here to wake 
up. 
To help address this problem, we 
have to take immediate steps. We have 
to secure our border. We have to pros-
ecute criminals again. We have to work 
with localities to prevent drug abuse 
rather than accommodate it. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of col-
leagues, as I mentioned, who will ad-
dress this issue in further detail. I am 
delighted that they have taken the 
time to be here. I am happy to yield to 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. C. 
SCOTT FRANKLIN). 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague 
from Louisiana giving me some time to 
talk about this vitally critical matter. 
Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support 
of our border agents, who work tire-
lessly to defend our Nation against the 
flow of deadly drugs crossing our 
southern border. Their job is made in-
credibly more difficult by the Biden ad-
ministration’s open border policies. 
I am sometimes asked why, as a Flo-
ridian, I care so deeply about what is 
happening on our southern border. 
Whether it is criminals, terrorists, 
human traffickers, or drug smugglers, 
problems at the Texas, New Mexico, 
Arizona, and California borders quickly 
become problems for all Americans. 
Florida may be hundreds of miles from 
the border, but illegal drugs from there 
are flooding our communities. 
The Tampa Bay area, my home, has 
an overdose rate that is 50 percent 
higher than the national average. To 
put that figure in context, 30 people in 
the Tampa Bay area are dying every 
week from overdoses. Let that sink in. 
The lion’s share of these overdoses are 
from fentanyl. This highly lethal drug, 
primarily manufactured in China and 
smuggled in by Mexican cartels, is 
many times stronger than heroin, mor-
phine, and other opioids. As little as 
two milligrams, smaller than the tip of 
a pencil, which you can see right here 
in perspective relative to a penny, is 
often enough to kill an adult. 
Fentanyl overdoses are now the num-
ber one killer of adults age 18 to 45. 
This is a national tragedy. It is exas-
perating to see the hands of our agents 
tied as they try to stop this crisis be-
cause their own government stands in 
the way. As one frustrated border 
agent told his chief in a recently 
leaked video, ‘‘for evil to triumph is for 
good men to do nothing.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the Biden administra-
tion is doing worse than nothing. It is 
actively promoting an open border pol-
icy that allows dangerous drugs to flow 
into our communities. This adminis-
tration has the blood of its citizens on 
its hands. For the safety and security 
of our Nation, it must stop. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for that 
compelling message. He is right, every 
State is a border State now, whether 
you are on the coast or whether you

are up north or anywhere in the coun-
try, and Tennessee is no exception to 
that. 
I yield now to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT), my good 
friend. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the great work that Chairman 
JOHNSON has been doing on this for the 
last few weeks, and I look forward to 
working with him in the future. 
Six days ago, Mr. Speaker, I spoke 
about the fentanyl crisis in this Cham-
ber. According to the trajectory of the 
CDC’s most recent 12-month data on 
drug overdose deaths, over 1,600 Ameri-
cans have died since that speech, 1,600. 
In reality, I am afraid that number is 
actually a lot higher thanks to ille-
gally trafficked fentanyl. 
Just last week, an unsuspecting high 
school 
student 
in 
Connecticut 
overdosed on marijuana laced with 
fentanyl. Thankfully, that student is 
all right, but sadly, there are many 
others who do not survive an overdose. 
A man called my office the other day. 
His son died. He was in the Carolinas, 
unsuspecting, took a street drug, and it 
was laced with fentanyl. They said the 
fentanyl, the pill was still in his 
mouth, it was that strong. 
Our government needs to stop illegal 
fentanyl from entering the United 
States right now, Mr. Speaker. Repub-
licans and Democrats must demand 
more action on this issue from our 
leaders. 
Here in the House, Speaker PELOSI 
controls the floor schedule and does 
not say much about illegal fentanyl 
trafficking. Down Pennsylvania Ave-
nue, at the White House, President 
Biden 
issued 
financial 
sanctions 
against foreign smugglers who bring 
drugs like fentanyl into our country. 
Mr. Speaker, that is a nice start, but I 
doubt these cartel thugs and bums will 
quit the drug trade just because they 
can’t use an American bank. 
Earlier today, I delivered a letter to 
Speaker PELOSI requesting that she do 
everything 
in 
her 
power 
to 
stop 
fentanyl from entering our country. 
President Biden received a copy of that 
letter as well. I urged them to consider 
my Fentanyl Trafficker Elimination 
Act, which would sentence fentanyl 
traffickers to life in prison, as a pos-
sible solution to reducing the amount 
of fentanyl that flows across our bor-
ders. 
Politically, I have little in common 
with Speaker PELOSI
and President 
Biden. I met President Biden after the 
prayer breakfast, and I told him that I 
don’t agree with hardly anything he 
does, but I pray for him every day, and 
that is true. However, I believe all 
three of us agree more needs to be done 
to stop Americans from overdosing on 
illegal fentanyl. I think overwhelming 
majorities in our respective parties feel 
the same. The American people will be 
glad to see us put politics aside and do 
something 
to 
reduce 
the 
tragic 
fentanyl overdose deaths that have be-
come too common in our communities. 
Unfortunately, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
we 
spend most of our time up here and, as 
I have said before, these bridges and 
post offices aren’t going to name them-
selves. We need to get back to the peo-
ple’s work, Mr. Speaker, and put an 
end to this tragedy. 
As always, Mr. Chairman, I appre-
ciate your more-than-lackluster abili-
ties. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. It is a seri-
ous issue. Every moment of levity 
helps us. I tell you what, if we can’t 
work in a bipartisan fashion to pros-
ecute criminals and stop the cartels, 
there may not be a lot of hope for this 
institution. I hope we can get back to 
that soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). Ari-
zona is a State that certainly deals 
with this every moment of every day, 
and she has seen it up close. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to read off some headlines. The 
first one is from the New York Post. It 
says, ‘‘Fentanyl now leading cause of 
death among teens in Arizona border 
county.’’ 
In 
the 
article 
it 
says, 
‘‘Fentanyl overdoses have overtaken 
car crashes as the leading cause of 
death among teenagers in an Arizona 
border 
county, 
as 
Governor 
Doug 
Ducey blames President Biden’s ne-
glect of the U.S. border for the rise in 
lethal drugs coming into the country.’’ 
The next article is from a TV station 
in Tucson, and it is entitled, ‘‘Arizona 
poison centers sound alarm as fentanyl 
overdoses spike.’’ 
Another article, and this one is from 
The Center Square. ‘‘Arizona seizes 
record amount of fentanyl, now cited 
as leading cause of death of Americans 
between 18 and 45.’’ It goes on to say, 
‘‘Authorities in Arizona seized $9 mil-
lion worth of fentanyl pills in the 
State’s largest bust of the illicit drug— 
enough, they said, to kill half the pop-
ulation of Arizona.’’ Wow. It goes on to 
say, ‘‘Fentanyl has become the drug of 
choice of the Mexican Sinaloa cartel, 
which controls the U.S.-Mexico border 
stretching from California to El Paso, 
Texas.’’ 
b 1845 
‘‘ ‘This is not a recreational drug’ 
Scottsdale Police Department Chief 
Jeff Walther said. ‘This is death.’ Two 
milligrams is a lethal dose. A teaspoon 
holds about 5,000 milligrams, enough to 
kill 2,500 people. One pound of fentanyl, 
or 453,592 milligrams, could kill 226,796 
people.’’ 
The next headline, and this is from 
NBC News: ‘‘Fentanyl Deaths from 
‘Mexican oxy’ pills hit Arizona hard.’’ 
And just a couple things it says in this 
article: Aaron Francisco Chavez swal-
lowed at least one of the sky blue pills 
at a Halloween party before falling 
asleep forever.’’ 
He and three other teenagers took 
this drug. 
And it says the four thought they 
were taking oxycodone. They didn’t 
know that it was laced with fentanyl. 
‘‘‘It’s the worst I have seen in 30 years, 
this toll that it’s taken on families,’ 
said Doug Coleman, the U.S. Drug En-
forcement 
Administration 
special 
agent in charge of Arizona. ‘The crack 
(cocaine) crisis was not as bad.’’’ 
These are just some of the headlines, 
ladies and gentlemen. And I live in the 
border State of Arizona. We are im-
pacted greatly. 
I call on President Biden. I plead 
with President Biden: Come down to 
the border. See it for yourself. Talk to 
the Border Patrol agents. They will 
show you all of the fentanyl pills that 
they have seized. But we know that 
there is a lot they haven’t even caught, 
and it is coming into our communities. 
It is killing our kids. It is killing our 
brothers. It is killing our sisters. 
Please, President Biden, take this seri-
ously and secure the border now. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, that passion is authentic. And 
as we said, from Arizona you see it 
every day. 
Mr. Speaker, I just received a text 
message 
from 
our 
colleague, 
Mr. 
KATKO, and he is the lead Republican 
on the Homeland Security Committee, 
and he said make sure when we are 
talking about the cartels to point out 
they are getting magnificently en-
riched through this alien smuggling 
surge, and they are, therefore, flush 
with cash, and they are now developing 
their own ability to make fentanyl. 
That is a dangerous game changer for 
the country. This crisis gets worse and 
worse by the hour. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I am 
honored by your yielding and the work 
that you are doing in this area. 
We are in the midst of perhaps the 
widest array of crises this country has 
ever seen. 
A global pandemic, inflation, and an 
unstable world stage that could erupt 
at any moment. 
Yet, COVID–19 and these uncertain-
ties aren’t the only things slowly in-
fecting every corner of this country. 
Fentanyl. Fentanyl. That word. 
It takes just two milligrams of this 
substance, which is 100 times more po-
tent than morphine, to kill a full- 
grown adult. 
In fact, Border Patrol has already 
seized more than 2,700 pounds at the 
southern border this year, 2,700 pounds, 
enough to kill every single American 
twice over. 
The massive inflow of this deadly 
substance is a direct result of our 
weakening southern border and policies 
designed to entice illegal immigrants 
to flow into our Nation. 
Often sourced directly from China, 
our open-border policies have allowed 
the worst of humanity to sneak this 
drug into every community, small and 
large, rural, urban, or suburban across 
our great America. 
It has become so bad, in fact, that 
fentanyl is now the leading cause of

death, as you have heard over and over 
again because it is so unbelievable, of 
all Americans between the ages of 18 
and 45. Imagine that. It is incompre-
hensible. 
Exacerbated by the stress of man-
dates and lockdowns, fentanyl-related 
overdoses across the board increased by 
more than 55 percent. 
I have seen it personally in my home 
district and across the great State of 
New Jersey, where thousands of fami-
lies last year lost a loved one to a 
fentanyl overdose. It has to end. It has 
to stop. 
We must secure our southern border. 
We must provide the resources to get 
this drug off our streets, and we must 
permanently make fentanyl a schedule 
I drug. 
It is time to finish the wall, stop the 
relocating of illegal migrants across 
the country, and we must empower our 
law enforcement at the border to up-
hold the rule of law. 
If not, we will lose our America that 
we love. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, strong words on a very impor-
tant set of issues. 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
hosting this Special Order tonight and 
continuing to keep the effort up to put 
this in front of the American people 
and the Congress and the White House. 
We have talked a couple times here 
this evening so far, and this is a sta-
tistic that I don’t know if it is reaching 
across to enough people. The leading 
cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 
45 is fentanyl. It isn’t car wrecks, it is 
not gun violence—which is usually peo-
ple violence it takes people to run a 
gun, to clear up a term—it is not can-
cer, not some other form, it is a drug. 
So what is this? It really boils down 
to it is a border problem. 
So when the Biden administration 
decided to have a much more open, 
hands-off policy on our borders, the op-
posite of what the Trump Administra-
tion had been attempting to do, this 
problem has been exacerbated. The 
number of people coming across, some 
for asylum reasons, others for eco-
nomic reasons, but the ones that are 
mixing in, that are coming with them 
are bringing this stuff with them. 
Now, as a Californian we have prime 
examples of what that looks like on 
our streets, what it looks like for 
homelessness and for people literally 
dying on the street; San Francisco 
being a shining example of what most 
cities don’t want to be with the prob-
lems they have on their streets with 
homelessness, with drug use, people 
dying on our streets. 
Needle programs. We call it clean 
needle exchange programs. They are 
not even exchange programs. Even one 
of my district towns, Chico, California, 
a nice town, people bring these needles 
in. And they don’t exchange them, as I 
mentioned, they just give them out 
until finally the city council changed, 
and they have moved in a direction to 
try and stop this sort of thing. It was 
killing a small valley town like Chico. 
And yet our administration is pro-
moting an open border policy that is 
allowing in this fentanyl. 
You heard some of my colleagues to-
night talking about how small of an 
amount it takes to not only negatively 
affect people, but kill them. It is ex-
tremely potent. It doesn’t take much 
of this stuff to cause a death. And it is 
coming across, pounds and pounds at a 
time, over our border. 
Why are we allowing this to happen? 
It’s coming freely over our borders, dis-
tributors without consequence putting 
it out, harming our people, harming 
this country. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, if the Democrats, if the 
White House really cared about the 
health and safety of the American citi-
zens, they would implement common-
sense policies to combat this epidemic, 
increasing search and seizures at our 
border, prosecuting traffickers instead 
of letting them go. 
It is just so unbelievable. People 
come up to me all the time as their 
Representative ‘‘We just can’t believe 
what is going on in our country late-
ly.’’ The prosecution letting people out 
of prison, right back to offend once 
again. 
And this wide-open border that is 
just an open conduit to so much harm 
from terrorism. They picked up five 
Syrians the other day. It isn’t just peo-
ple 
coming 
from 
Central 
America 
wanting a better life or reuniting fami-
lies when you have single young men 
coming across the border. This is a 
fraud that is being committed against 
the American people here, and fentanyl 
is just one example of harming not just 
economically but our open border, and 
so many people with an illegal drug be-
cause we have a terrible policy. 
Our border control folks are so de-
moralized by what is going on here, 
and so are the people of this country. 
We have many crises these days, but 
this is one of the worst because we are 
losing the identity of our country with 
what has been going on. 
President Biden’s team needs to get 
on the job here and enforce our border 
and not allow this poison to keep com-
ing across. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
remarks. 
The Border Patrol agents are as frus-
trated as we are. Demoralized is ex-
actly right. We have met with them 
and heard their stories. And the reason 
they are so frustrated, Mr. Speaker, is 
because all of this crisis is completely 
avoidable. These are the results of bad 
policy choices, and that is what is so 
outrageous. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
going to try to add a few additional 
things about fentanyl. 
I first got here about 7 years ago, and 
at the time there were 47,000 deaths 
caused by illegal drugs a year. By com-
parison, there were 57,000 people who 
died in Vietnam, but that was over a 
10-year period, a 12-year period. This is 
over 1 year, 47,000 people. And it was a 
national crisis. And every politician 
had to address that crisis. 
Well, 7 years later what became of 
that statistic, 47,000 deaths a year from 
fentanyl? It went up to 100,000 deaths a 
year. 
Now, I have been at the border five 
times. Every time I am down there the 
Border Patrol, again and again, empha-
sizes that with this open flow of people 
coming into this country, you’re get-
ting unlimited fentanyl. 
So we have to do two obvious things 
to address the problem. We just passed 
a continuing resolution today with 
some increases in there, but the budget 
proposed by our President doesn’t in-
crease funding for the Border Patrol at 
all. You go through that budget, 12 per-
cent over here, 18 percent over here, 7 
percent over here. Border Patrol, noth-
ing. Like these lives don’t matter at 
all. We have got to spend more money 
at the border. 
Secondly, when it comes down to 
penalties for people who are selling 
this fentanyl or trafficking in fentanyl, 
they are not great enough. 
Right now, your penalties for heroin, 
which is a fraction as lethal as 
fentanyl, are much higher, the manda-
tory minimums, than the cutoff for 
fentanyl. 
I have introduced a bill that is going 
to deal with that called the Fentanyl 
Penalties Parity Act, which adjusts the 
mandatory minimum to be the same as 
heroin. 
So we have got to throw more people 
in prison. That 100,000 deaths, by the 
way, that is not what we call non-
violent. Ask the parents of the people 
who died of these fentanyl overdoses 
whether that is just a nonviolent 
crime, and we will slap somebody on 
the wrist and who cares? We have got 
to up the penalties on people who are 
selling that fentanyl. We had 560 people 
die in Milwaukee County alone last 
year, and Milwaukee County is not 
that big. 
And secondly, we have got to do 
something at that border. The idea 
that these fentanyl drugs continue to 
flow across the southern border, and we 
can pretend there is nothing we can do, 
that we can continue to allow KAMALA 
HARRIS
to look out at the border, 
which is just like a joke on the Amer-
ican people. It is a joke on anybody 
who has had a loved one die of this 
fentanyl. That has got to end. 
I hope everybody in this building, 
those people fortunate enough to meet 
the President tell him, Get KAMALA 
HARRIS off that border and get us some 
more Border Patrol agents down there 
so it shows that we are taking the lives 
of these 100,000 people a year a little 
more seriously.

February 8, 2022 
b 1900 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
that forceful message. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 32 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to yield next to a 
gentleman who has been on the front 
lines of all this as a retired police lieu-
tenant. He is also a former professional 
hockey player, and that is pretty cool, 
too. He is a tough guy, but he knows 
the issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the congressman for this Special Order. 
It is needed and I appreciate the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss 
the devastating fentanyl crisis that is 
wreaking havoc on our communities 
and our families. The hardest thing I 
ever had to do during my 23 years as a 
law enforcement officer was tell an 
unsuspecting mother that her child had 
died due to a drug overdose. 
The opioid crisis has ravaged our 
communities for years, and when peo-
ple were forced inside during this pan-
demic, things only got worse. For the 
first time ever, in 2021, drug overdoses 
in the United States topped 100,000. 
Overdose deaths are now claiming a 
new victim every 5 minutes. 
As stated earlier, fentanyl overdoses 
were the leading cause of death for 
Americans aged 18 to 45 just last year. 
That is more than the COVID–19 
deaths, car crashes, or suicides put to-
gether for that age group. 
The American people are suffering. 
We have a moral obligation to do ev-
erything we can to prevent another ad-
diction, to prevent another death, to 
prevent another heartbroken family. 
The DEA revealed in December that 
criminal drug networks in Mexico, 
using resources from China, are traf-
ficking fentanyl over Biden’s open 
southern border at a rate that could 
provide a lethal dose to every Amer-
ican over seven times. 
Cartels and their drug runners are 
exploiting open border policies of Joe 
Biden and this administration, and the 
American people are literally paying 
the price with their lives. Without seri-
ous action, this fentanyl will continue 
to flow across our border and affect our 
families and communities. 
Joe Biden must secure our border by 
finishing the wall, fully reinstate the 
Remain in Mexico policy and send the 
clear message: Don’t come to the 
United States illegally. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. I appre-
ciate his words and his expertise on the 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN), who I think 
will address some of the other crises we 
are facing as well. 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from Louisiana for having 
this Special Order. 
Mr. Speaker, there are multiple cri-
ses. That is exactly right. It is nearly 
impossible to discuss President Biden’s 
self-inflicted economic crisis without 
mentioning his excessive spending. I 
am 
not 
talking 
about 
money 
to 
strengthen our military or to make 
America 
more 
competitive 
in 
the 
world. Biden and the Democrats have 
no interest in that. This out-of-control 
spending is necessary only to appease 
the 
radical 
Democrat 
base 
who 
prioritize radical climate change poli-
cies without a care in the world for 
their consequences. 
As a result, inflation sits at a 40-year 
high and our national debt has in-
creased by trillions of dollars. For 
years, my colleagues across the aisle 
have worked tirelessly to desensitize 
Americans to the word ‘‘trillion,’’ and 
they have succeeded for the most part 
because a trillion of anything is such a 
mind-boggling figure for the average 
human to wrap his mind around it. 
When I was elected to Congress in 
2014, our national debt was $17 trillion. 
Fast-forward 8 years later, our na-
tional debt has topped $30 trillion. This 
should shock every American taxpayer, 
but it doesn’t seem to. Allow me to put 
this into perspective. 
If you owed $1 trillion, and you de-
cided to pay $1 per second until your 
debt was paid off, it would take you 
around 31,700 years to become debt- 
free. Now, multiply that by 30, for $30 
trillion of our national debt. I am no 
mathematician, but this amounts to 
approximately 951,000 years. So if we 
paid $1 per second until our $30 trillion 
national debt is paid off, it would take 
us just shy of a million years to be-
come debt-free. 
President Biden and the Democrats 
must be stopped. American solvency 
must be preserved. Generations of fu-
ture Americans are counting on us to 
regain 
control 
of 
Washington’s 
unsustainable spending. We literally 
cannot afford to fail. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, that debt is so staggering. 
And Dr. Babin is right, so many people 
don’t stop to think about the mag-
nitude of it and what we are doing to 
our children, our grandchildren, every 
future generation of Americans. We 
better get control of it. Thank you for 
that insight tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), another 
gentleman with a lot of expertise, who 
will address some of the crime crises 
that we are facing. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
and I thank him for hosting this night. 
Mr. Speaker, for years, Democrats 
have been pushing this ‘‘defund the po-
lice’’ rhetoric that has demonized our 
law enforcement officers and left them 
unequipped and abandoned by their 
government. Now, we are paying the 
price. 
In the year 2021, 73 of our bravest po-
lice officers lost their lives in defense 
of their country and their commu-
nities. This is a 59 percent increase 
from 2020 and the most that we have 
had since 1995. This is utterly unac-
ceptable. The language from top Demo-
crats empowers those that wish to do 
harm upon others and leaves our law 
enforcement stranded with nowhere to 
look for aid. 
After an entire year of this detri-
mental rhetoric, at least 16 U.S. cities 
have set new homicide records in 2021, 
346 officers were shot, and we saw 115 
percent increase in ambush-style at-
tacks on law enforcement from 2020. 
Democrats aren’t just downplaying the 
impacts of their soft-on-crime rhetoric, 
they are completely ignoring it. 
Shoplifting in California and New 
York has gotten so bad that it is now 
mocked on social media and offenders 
simply walk into a store, grab what 
they want, and walk out. The First 
Congressional District of Georgia is un-
fortunately no exception to this cur-
rent trend. 
In the first half of 2021, violent in-
creased 7 percent, property crimes rose 
10 percent, and shoplifting has risen 9 
percent, all in Savannah alone. 
Folks, this rhetoric is harmful. It 
hurts our communities, it hurts our 
law enforcement, and it hurts our con-
stituents. We must put a stop to this 
and reinforce the fact that we have the 
backs of our police officers. This issue 
is of the utmost importance, and I call 
upon President Biden to say, unequivo-
cally, that he supports our men and 
women in blue. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his in-
sights there. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Vice 
Chairman JOHNSON for organizing this 
Special Order hour tonight and for 
yielding me time to speak. 
Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to ring the 
alarm bell regarding the United States’ 
current financial crisis caused by the 
Biden administration and Democrats’ 
far-left 
policies 
and 
out-of-control 
spending. Just last week, the national 
debt eclipsed $30 trillion. 
As our national debt balloons, Amer-
ican taxpayers will be left to foot the 
bill, not only for the billions and tril-
lions of dollars we are spending annu-
ally but also on a dramatically increas-
ing cost—interest on the debt. 
The Federal Government has contin-
ued to kick the can down the road, ig-
noring the explosive problems caused 
by our out-of-control spending and 
greatly diminishing our future genera-
tion’s quality of life through no fault 
of their own. What a gutless and inex-
cusable thing to do. 
Well, our time is running out, as we 
expect interest rates to rise in the im-
mediate future. If interest rates rise to 
just 5.1 percent, as was the case in 2021, 
American taxpayers would suddenly be 
burdened with an annual interest pay-
ment on the national debt of $1.5 tril-
lion, twice the budget for the Depart-
ment of Defense, or almost 75 percent

of all income taxes collected in fiscal 
year 2021. 
Put another way, three-quarters of 
the income taxes Americans pay would 
go toward nothing more than paying 
interest on the national debt, while 
only a quarter would be left to pay for 
much-needed programs and expendi-
tures like the Justice Department, in-
frastructure, and defense. 
Americans’ pocketbooks are hurting. 
Whether at the gas pump, at the gro-
cery store, or for the energy that heats 
your homes, prices are going up every-
where due to President Biden and 
Democrats’ far-left policies and out-of- 
control spending. 
Just last week, House Democrats 
doubled down on these disastrous deci-
sions by ramming through their $325 
billion America COMPETES Act—more 
like America concedes to China act, if 
you ask me—which only will worsen 
America’s economic crisis. 
How can anyone sit here today and 
encourage this reckless and irrespon-
sible behavior? I have two sons; Guy, 
who is 4 years old, and Sam, who is 10 
months. They will have to make pay-
ments on this massive debt for their 
entire lives, and the generations that 
follow will do the same unless we act. 
We must rein in Washington’s out-of- 
control government spending to pre-
vent future generations from paying 
the price for our financial mistakes. 
This ticking time bomb, otherwise 
known as our national debt, has been 
ignored for far too long. With rising in-
terest rates on the horizon, now is the 
last time and the best time for Presi-
dent Biden and Members of Congress to 
take a serious look in the mirror and 
ask ourselves if we really think the 
American people are okay with our 
country being steered off this fiscal 
cliff. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend. I think 
about the same thing, our children and 
what we are doing to them and their 
future. They will have less security, 
less financial stability, less oppor-
tunity. They won’t have the great for-
tune that we have because we are mak-
ing bad policy decisions right now. We 
are 
adding 
to 
the 
debt. 
We 
are 
compounding the problem day by day, 
and we just can’t get anyone here to 
pay any attention to it. 
The Democrats in charge refuse to 
address the issue. In fact, they just 
continue to double down on bad policy, 
and it is just so frustrating. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) to talk about 
this energy crisis more. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Vice Chairman JOHNSON for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no secret that 
President Biden’s slew of crises are 
self-inflicted wounds that have dev-
astated American workers, their fami-
lies, and small businesses across this 
great Nation. The ongoing energy cri-
sis is no exception. 
President Biden’s destructive energy 
agenda has created skyrocketing gas 
prices, forced burdensome home heat-
ing bills on Americans already strug-
gling with record-high inflation, de-
stroyed thousands of energy jobs, and 
canceled American energy independ-
ence. 
The energy crisis has been fueled by 
the Biden Administration’s failed pol-
icy decisions, starting with canceling 
the Keystone XL Pipeline, which elimi-
nated over 11,000 American jobs. 
Infamously, 
President 
Biden 
also 
greenlit 
Russian 
President 
Putin’s 
Nord Stream II pipeline. He begged 
OPEC to produce more oil, and released 
three days’ worth of oil from our own 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve ahead of 
last Thanksgiving. 
Unfortunately, the ramifications of 
President Biden’s ill-advised policies 
extend far beyond the gas pump and 
now into matters of national security. 
President Biden surrendered American 
energy independence to benefit our ad-
versaries, including Russia. By handing 
Russian President Vladimir Putin the 
Nord Stream II Pipeline, Biden aban-
doned vital leverage, leverage that 
could be used right now as tensions rise 
between Russia and Ukraine. 
Yet, after conceding this opportunity 
many months ago, the President now 
claims he will bring an end to the Nord 
Stream II Pipeline if Russia actually 
invades Ukraine. Really? So do you 
think this new claim is going to make 
Russia tremble in their boots? 
Following a year of embarrassing 
weakness on the world stage, this 
empty threat means nothing to Vladi-
mir Putin. But energy independence 
means everything to Americans strug-
gling to fill their gas tanks and to keep 
their families warm this winter, as 
they 
wonder 
why 
President 
Biden 
prioritized Russian energy above their 
own. 
Mr. Speaker, we must always put 
Americans first, yet the Biden adminis-
tration and their self-inflicted energy 
crisis have again failed America. 
b 1915 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, as we have illustrated tonight 
with so many Members coming in from 
all over the country to express our con-
cerns about all of these crises—and we 
genuinely could go for hours upon 
hours. But the hour is getting late to-
night, and our Special Order hour is 
running out. 
I just want to reiterate again some of 
the things we highlighted in this last 
hour on the floor here in the people’s 
House tonight. 
We addressed this economic crisis. It 
is just staggering. A $30 trillion Fed-
eral debt is a number that previous 
generations of Americans couldn’t even 
have imagined. 
We talked about the crime crisis and 
the utter lack of responsibility that 
Democrats in charge have shown and 
that the White House has shown to ad-
dress this issue. 
The 
border 
crisis 
and 
now 
the 
fentanyl crisis that is directly related 
to that. It has become the number one 
killer of Americans aged 18 to 45 in this 
country. 
The energy crisis—because I come 
from an energy state, the State of Lou-
isiana, I just want to conclude with a 
couple of remarks to put a fine point 
on that latter issue before we close this 
evening. 
Mr. Speaker, the problem here is 
that, as with all of these crises, all this 
is totally avoidable. All of this is the 
result of policy choices. It is bad deci-
sions, bad policy by the White House 
and by the Democrats in charge. 
Mr. Speaker, on the energy crisis, 
President Biden’s anti-energy agenda 
has caused the price of a gallon of gas 
to skyrocket to $3.42 nationally. Last 
week, oil prices hit $90 a barrel. Mr. 
Speaker, $90 is a 7-year high. In just 
the last month, oil prices have surged 
37 percent. That is in 1 month, and it 
has been on a steady and rapid in-
crease. 
Given this agenda and the rapid rise 
in prices, it is not surprising that, ac-
cording to a recent Gallup poll, Amer-
ican satisfaction with our energy poli-
cies is the lowest in two decades. That 
is because Americans have paid at the 
pump more now than they paid since 
the Obama-Biden administration. 
U.S. households will also pay be-
tween $700 and $1,700 more for heat this 
winter, depending on where they live 
and what type of fuel they use. More 
than one in four Americans report now 
that they skipped basic expenses to pay 
their energy bill in the past year. One 
in five Americans report they could not 
pay their full energy bill. This is a cri-
sis. 
Let me just tell you, and break it 
down in layman’s terms, why this is 
happening. 
From the very beginning of the Biden 
administration, the first couple of 
weeks, as soon as he took office, he 
issued that slew of executive orders, a 
record number of executive orders. 
Among those early executive orders 
were his directions on energy policy. 
He reflexively did exactly the oppo-
site of what President Trump had done 
and accomplished. We were energy 
dominant, not just energy independent. 
We were energy dominant because of 
the Trump-era policies. 
What does President Biden do? He 
does exactly the opposite, reflexively 
almost. President Trump moved us to 
domestic oil and gas production to in-
crease that to make us energy domi-
nant, to make us a net exporter. What 
does President Biden do? The opposite. 
He shuts down and puts a morato-
rium on drilling and exploration on 
Federal lands, including offshore, off 
the coast of States like mine, Lou-
isiana. That was a killer for the na-
tional economy. It is a direct contrib-
utor to driving the costs up. 
He also killed the Keystone pipeline, 
of course. That was a big source, an ar-
tery, as it were, for domestic produc-
tion and supply in our country. Here is 
the great irony. Ostensibly, the reason

February 8, 2022 
for doing all those things is he wanted 
to help the environment, I guess. I 
guess he owed it to some interest 
groups or something. They claim that 
that would be better for the environ-
ment if we moved away from fossil 
fuels, as we always hear. 
But here is the great irony—and I 
will close with this. When President 
Biden shut down domestic production, 
not only did he drive up the cost of all 
the fuel that we need to heat our 
homes and to fill up our gas tanks and 
all the rest, not only did he increase 
the pain on American consumers, but 
here is the irony. When they shut down 
domestic production, the demand for 
fossil fuels, oil and gas, in this country 
didn’t go down. The demand didn’t 
change nationally just because the 
President decided he didn’t want to 
supply it anymore. In fact, the demand 
is at least stabilized and, in some 
cases, has gone up. 
So, what does that mean? Well, 
Americans have to get their supply 
from somewhere else. If we are not 
going to produce it here, the bountiful 
resources that God has given us be-
neath our own feet, if we are not going 
to do it here, we have to get it from 
somewhere else. 
The Biden administration turns to 
OPEC. They turn to Russia, Saudi Ara-
bia, begging for more production and 
begging for our supply to be met from 
these overseas parties. 
Do you know what the greatest irony 
about all of this is? Ostensibly, they 
wanted to help the environment, but do 
you know what they do when we get 
more of our oil and gas from Russia 
and Saudi Arabia? We do exponentially 
more harm to the environment. 
If you believe their metrics, this is a 
terrible policy solution because—guess 
what?—we produce oil and gas in a 
much cleaner fashion in the United 
States than they do in those other 
countries. 
So, the great irony is not only do 
they drive up costs for American con-
sumers, not only do they increase the 
pain for everybody; they are actually 
doing more harm to the world that 
they claim they want to help. 
It is truly unbelievable, not to men-
tion it has destabilized us and put Rus-
sia in a better position. Now, we see 
the results of that on a whole different 
crisis that we didn’t even have time to 
address tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I am out of time. I 
would just close by saying that the 
American people cannot tolerate this 
for much longer, and they won’t tol-
erate it for much longer. We cannot 
wait for this election cycle that comes 
up later this year when we get an op-
portunity to be returned to the major-
ity to govern this place again and bring 
some sanity back to Washington. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
ECONOMICS OF CURING DISEASE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, I got behind this microphone, 
and we were actually trying to show 
something that was a bit optimistic. 
But like everyone else on our side, the 
frustration we are going through on so 
many of the Democrat policies that I 
don’t think were meant to be mean- 
spirited or so dystopian in the damage 
they cause, particularly to the working 
poor, which is one of my fixations— 
sometimes, the economics is the eco-
nomics, sometimes virtue signaling 
over the unintended consequences. 
I want to go over something and try 
to explain why I think this is such a 
big deal for both those on the left and 
those of us on the right. There is actu-
ally a window of optimism, but it is 
going to take a policy pivot. 
Last week, I got up here and talked 
about—remember, I gave a couple of 
presentations last December, a major 
success in curing type 1 diabetes. Now, 
it was really only one use case where 
they were able to take T cells and con-
vert them into insulin-producing cells. 
In that particular one, the individual 
would need some immunosuppressants 
because of the body’s reaction to it. 
Now, we have an organization that is 
doing some of the same technology 
with T cells, turning them into insulin- 
producing cells but with CRISPR as a 
partner. They are doing a tiny tweak. 
The model says the body won’t recog-
nize it as a foreign cell, and you won’t 
need immunosuppressant drugs for the 
rest of your life. 
Conceptually, why is this such a big, 
big, big deal to have a cure for type 1? 
If you dig through the literature, it 
says that, at least for people with type 
2, we might have a way to get their 
body—actually, we do have a way— 
dear Lord, let the technology be true 
and actually coming forward—to help 
individuals in type 2, their bodies to 
produce insulin again. 
Then, we have some other big policy 
things we would have to do here. We 
would have to have an honest conversa-
tion of how we do nutrition support. 
We would have to have an honest con-
versation of what we do in the farm 
bill, what we encourage Americans to 
grow, instead of just sort of the com-
modity crops. 
North America used to grow 3,500 dif-
ferent types of grains. Maybe you de-
sign a farm system that allows both re-
gional and uniqueness for different arid 
climates and others, sort of a cacoph-
ony, or whatever the proper word there 
would be, for optionality because there 
is a food security issue when you only 
grow certain crops. 
God forbid you have like what is hap-
pening in parts of Europe, where olive 
trees have a type of fungus. Olive trees 
that are hundreds and hundreds of 
years old are dying. We make ourselves 
much more fragile in food security. 
I sort of say that because I actually 
see an elegant solution coming here if 
we could change the way we view pub-
lic policy. It is often this right-left par-
adigm of the left’s version of wanting 
to be compassionate. They are going to 
build more clinics for those in urban 
areas and Tribal communities and even 
certain world populations that have 
just stunning percentages of type 2 dia-
betes and the misery that comes with 
that. Put up more clinics. My argu-
ment is: Screw that. Let’s cure it. 
If we are seeing technology that may 
lead us to a cure, put the resources for-
ward that create the disruption be-
cause curing a misery is so much more 
wonderful than helping people being 
able to maintain and live within their 
misery. 
Oh, by the way, for those of us who 
are absolutely fixated that the debt is 
going to destroy this Republic, it 
makes a hell of a lot of difference. 
Let’s walk through some of the math 
of why I wish we were having this level 
of optimism that the technology dis-
ruptions we have now of knowing how 
to cure so many diseases actually may 
be the path that we start to take on 
the crushing debt that is coming. 
This is important. This is year-old 
data from CBO. It is a year out of date. 
The numbers today are much worse. In 
29 years, $112 trillion of publicly bor-
rowed debt in today’s dollars; the vast 
majority of it is Medicare, Social Secu-
rity. The rest of the budget is in bal-
ance. 
Why this is so important is the polit-
ical class, particularly here in Wash-
ington, we have lied for decades to our 
constituents. 
The left will say: Oh, rich people 
don’t pay enough. We spend too much 
money on defense. 
Republicans say: Oh, we have to get 
rid of foreign aid, waste, and fraud. 
Maybe those are true, but they are 
not the driver of the debt. The debt is 
demographics. We are getting old as a 
society. You are going to see some 
slides later on that really will kick you 
in the head on these numbers. That 
$112 trillion of publicly borrowed debt 
as projected by CBO last year—and this 
is a number that says there are no 
more pandemics and no more reces-
sions. 
How many of you want to have a se-
cure retirement? How many of you give 
a darn about your kids? Well, think 
about one little factoid here. You just 
saw that Medicare was the primary 
driver of U.S. sovereign debt. What was 
it? $77 to $78 trillion of borrowing over 
the next 29 years? Thirty-one percent 
of Medicare is just diabetes. Now, you 
are seeing the tie. 
If I come to you and say: I hope it 
works, but considering the numbers 
and the benefit of if it does work, why 
aren’t we, at least the left and the 
right, saying let’s end people’s misery? 
Oh, by the way, by doing that, one of 
the greatest effects we can have on so-
ciety is actually curing these diseases 
that make us poorer, sicker, and actu-
ally are the primary drivers of our 
debt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1068 
February 8, 2022 
b 1930 
Mr. Speaker, 31 percent of Medicare 
spending is just related to diabetes—33 
percent of all healthcare costs. So, re-
member, Mr. Speaker, the problem 
with this place is ObamaCare, the ACA, 
and the Republican alternatives were 
finance bills. They weren’t about what 
we spend, they were who got sub-
sidized. That is the math. The Demo-
crats’ bill had three tiers, the Repub-
lican had four tiers, but it was who was 
cross-subsidizing whom and then how 
much was coming out of the general 
fund to subsidize those groups. They 
were spending subsidization bills. They 
had nothing to do with what we spend. 
My argument is if we would embrace 
the technology, push it forward—and 
we have changed a bunch of laws to le-
galize the very technology that will 
disrupt healthcare costs—then we save 
Medicare. But we also end a hell of a 
lot of misery in our society. 
And is that Republican or Democrat? 
I am sure at some point someone will 
contribute to one side or the other and 
we will turn it into partisan, right? 
But at least between now and then it 
is technology. 
And, once again, I fixate on this also: 
5 percent of our brothers and sisters 
who have multiple chronic conditions 
are the majority of our healthcare 
spending. 
If you say you care about healthcare, 
Mr. Speaker, is it nationalizing health 
care? 
Well, 
once 
again, 
nationalizing 
health care, the Medicare for All, 
doesn’t remove any costs. It just col-
lectivizes how you can ration. 
If you want to reduce costs, cure peo-
ple, and end the misery, once again, 5 
percent of our brothers and sisters are 
the majority of our healthcare spend-
ing. 
You already see what is going on 
right now, Mr. Speaker, with some of 
the messenger RNA, some of the new 
stem cell therapies, the number of dis-
eases we are curing. We now have a 
cure for hemophilia. We are about to 
have trials for sickle cell. You already 
see in so many diseases we are taking 
on, so many of the blood cancers today, 
we can cure. But the 10,000-pound go-
rilla is diabetes. 
Maybe it is a little bit utopianism, 
but we have seen a perfect example of 
this. 
Do you remember this body just a 
decade or so ago, Mr. Speaker? 
We were having a real stressor. We 
were having to have conversations with 
State Medicaid systems on how we 
were going to pay for all these liver 
transplants for those people who may 
have had too good a time in the seven-
ties. Remember, we had hundreds of 
thousands of individuals in the United 
States that we thought were having 
failing livers from hepatitis C. Liver 
transplant clinics were being funded 
and organized all over the country, and 
then, suddenly—I think the first drug 
out was Sovaldi—we figured out how to 
cure it. And the drug was outrageously 
expensive, 
it 
was 
something 
like 
$88,000, but it was a fraction of the cost 
of a liver transplant and then someone 
spending the rest of their life on anti- 
rejection drugs. 
And then another drug came to mar-
ket with a slightly different tech-
nology. The price crashed and saved a 
fortune and ended lots of future mis-
ery. 
We lived in the last decade an exam-
ple of what I am talking about. 
But I beg of my friends on the Demo-
crat side: Think about your legislation 
like H.R. 3. We know H.R. 3 function-
ally makes Big Pharma bigger because 
it incentivizes them to take their cur-
rent 
portfolio 
of 
pharmaceuticals, 
make little tweaks, and keep them. 
But the capital staff for the small 
biotechs that are disruptive is crushed. 
There are good articles out there, and 
there are good economic papers that 
make it very clear. 
If the Democrats get their way, it is 
great politics. It is absolutely brilliant 
politics. Talk about drug prices, how 
outraged we are. We are outraged. 
But, Mr. Speaker, are we outraged to 
the point that you are going to kill the 
next generation because they don’t get 
the next pharmaceutical that is cura-
tive? 
We need to think maybe more with a 
calculator 
like 
economists, 
maybe 
economists with a soul and a heart 
rather than: Hey, this is brilliant for 
the next election cycle. 
Back again, think about the body, 
the place we work in. We go home, we 
campaign, and we say all the wonderful 
things we are going to do. But the fact 
of the matter is, this last fiscal year, 77 
percent of all the spending here was on 
autopilot. It is what we call manda-
tory. 
Ten percent was defense. Thirteen 
percent was everything else. We act as 
if we are here doing something when if 
you put defense and say we are just 
going to keep the baseline where it is 
at and the 77 percent is mandatory— 
Social Security and Medicare, you fall 
under a certain income, you are part of 
a certain ethnic or tribal group or you 
hit a certain age—it is automatic. It is 
formulaic. 
This is all we get to focus on. This is 
what all the theater here is about. And 
one of the reasons I think the theater 
has gotten so hyperbolic is we know 
this is what wipes us out, and not one 
person here has actually voted on this. 
It has been, except for the last handful 
of votes the Democrats moved forward, 
we were adding, like we just did today, 
in a piece of legislation that actually 
added to mandatory spending because 
it is easy. It makes you look like a 
hero. Hey, all we protected is there. 
But we don’t have the resources to 
pay for it. 
To give you an idea, Mr. Speaker, of 
how crappy the last fiscal year was and 
how much we borrowed, these slides 
are all out of date now. The numbers 
are much worse. One of the reasons I 
grabbed this one is, take a look here. 
This was 2030. We are going to hit $30 
trillion of borrowing. Well, we hit that 
last week. 
Think about what we have done. And 
there was a time here a couple of dec-
ades ago the discussion was: Well, are 
you willing to do entitlement reform? 
Take that off the table. I know it is 
great political rhetoric, but it is too 
late. 
The 
vast 
majority 
of 
baby 
boomers are already in their retire-
ment age. We missed the window. The 
window was a quarter century ago if we 
were going to do entitlement reform. 
Other than the things we have come 
here and talked about, the massive 
subsidies that we give actually to real-
ly, really, really rich people, when it is 
their third home on Martha’s Vineyard 
and we give them subsidized flood in-
surance, or the Democrats’ Build Back 
Better bill which if you would be mak-
ing $400,000 or $800,000 a year and you 
were going to get—what is it, $125,000 
in tax credits if you bought the right 
electric vehicle, the right solar panel. 
At some point we need to have an hon-
est conversation. We calculated over 
the next 10 years there are $1.4 trillion 
of subsidies for really rich people. 
So instead of the constant rhetoric of 
let’s tax rich people more and make 
them pay their fair share, maybe we 
should just stop subsidizing them be-
cause the subsidies create distortions. 
So back to the thing we don’t do here 
called math, the 2050 number, we were 
saying we were going to be at 195 per-
cent of GDP. That number, the best 
calculation as of today is 15 points 
higher than that. We will be well over 
200. And that is a baseline, not another 
pandemic, not another war, and not an-
other major recession. 
Then we start to deal with our new-
est reality, and I should have grabbed 
the slide, but you see part of it here. 
There is a model put out by CBO that 
says that if interest rates over the 
time of that 29-year period, if the base-
line borrowing costs of the United 
States was 2 points higher in that 25 
year, then every dime—every dime—of 
tax receipts will go just to pay inter-
est. We have made ourselves that frag-
ile, that if the cost of borrowing money 
goes up by 2 points on U.S. sovereign 
debts over the baseline, then every 
dime in the future just goes solely to 
cover the interest costs. 
We have lost our minds. And yet, 
think of the crazy stuff we debate here. 
It is as if we are desperate to debate 
the shiny objects, the stupid, little in-
dignation of the day, and at the same 
time we are borrowing $47,000 every 
second—$47,000 every second. 
That is why I keep coming behind 
these mikes saying that it doesn’t have 
to be this sort of dystopian, crushing 
future. I need the majority to think 
differently, and I need my minority 
over here to think differently. Because 
here are some of the drivers, and this is 
really uncomfortable. I have been 
booed in front of audiences when I have 
given this presentation, but the math 
is the math, and the math always wins.

We can virtue signal, we can tell anec-
dotal stories, and we can talk about 
how compassionate we are. But at 
some point, the math will win. 
This is important because I am going 
to show you the sister slide to this in 
a couple of moments, and you need to 
get your heads around this. The money 
you put in taxes, into Social Security, 
and the money you are going to get out 
of Social Security are pretty close to 
each other. You actually get a little bit 
more out. It is a fairly even deal. But 
that chart you were seeing, Mr. Speak-
er, is substantially driven by this. So 
the average couple—and this is some-
one who is retiring right about now— 
has put in about $161,000 into Medicare, 
and they are getting $522,000 out. And 
those are adjusted dollars. So, ceteris 
paribus, whatever the fancy term is, 
that gap there is the primary driver of 
U.S. sovereign debt. 
So, Mr. Speaker, what happens when 
you talk to millennials? 
We all have in our offices over here 
kids born in 1985, and they just think 
they are never going to see any of this. 
These are actual surveys where they 
already see themselves in enough fi-
nancial pain, and they are worried. 
Then they have people like me get be-
hind the microphone and show them 
the slides and basically say: If we don’t 
do something about this, your retire-
ment—and this is a technical economic 
term—you are screwed. We need to 
start using language like that around 
here because somehow the fancy lan-
guage doesn’t seem to sink into the 
thick skulls here. 
Do you care about this generation? 
These 25-year-olds we have in our of-
fices who are freaky smart, they are 
working their hearts out, and they 
look at the numbers saying, Oh, my 
God, when they start getting near their 
retirement age, the United States will 
have a couple hundred percent of debt 
to GDP, and if interest rates are up, if 
interest rates are up—I didn’t bring the 
slide—there is one model that says 
that 2 percent higher baseline bor-
rowing costs, we go from that 210 per-
cent debt to GDP in 29 years to about 
300, 320 percent because of the multi-
plying effect because we never pay any-
thing off. 
The model as it is as of today says 
that millennial, that person born in 
1985, they are going to put $236,000 into 
Medicare. And if we don’t do something 
to disrupt the cost of healthcare, then 
they are going to take out over $1.2 
million, and this makes the curve 
steepen. When you see the CBO curve, 
you wonder why it starts to steepen. It 
is this delta there. 
There is a hope. There is a path, but 
it needs to be everything. I have my 
healthcare disruptions, but I have also 
come here and talked about how you 
can change the immigration system to 
maximize economic growth and not 
crush the working poor. When we open 
up the borders—we have brought the 
papers here—we crush the working 
poor because we flood the country with 
people with similar skill sets. 
Mr. Speaker, in the last year and a 
half, we are what, 1.7 million behind in 
legal immigration. The kid who just 
got the Ph.D. from Arizona State Uni-
versity and we are sending him home. 
You have seen the healthcare. If you 
care about the environment, the con-
cept of radically changing the way we 
look at regulation using crowdsourcing 
and data instead of the 1938 model of 
stick paper in file cabinets, a Tax Code 
that maximizes economic growth. 
Are we willing to have really disrup-
tive conversations, or should we go to 
a border adjustability model, so you 
don’t have a tax arbitrage for around 
the world to move products to the 
United States instead of making them 
here? 
b 1945 
There are ways, and the trick is, the 
model says you have got to do all of it 
almost at the same time. And this 
place can barely agree on what time of 
day it is. Then we have seen policies 
around here that when so many of our 
brothers and sisters who are older, are 
basically saying it is the rational deci-
sion: I am leaving the labor force. 
One of the other parts of that growth 
model is everyone is needed. Every 
American is needed. We need your tal-
ents. We need your labor, particularly 
if you are older. Would this place be 
willing to provide certain incentives? 
So you are 65, you don’t need to retire. 
But we are going to fix parts of the 
way we tax your benefits to incentivize 
you to stay in the labor force. 
There are ideas that work that basi-
cally make the future something opti-
mistic. My wife and I joke about this, 
and I have said it behind this micro-
phone a bunch of times. We are both 59 
years old and I have a 6-year-old 
daughter. You know you are pathologi-
cally optimistic when you are 59 years 
old and you have a 6-year-old daughter. 
But darn it, doesn’t she have the right, 
doesn’t the kid that is growing up in a 
neighborhood 
of 
poverty 
have 
the 
right, doesn’t the person who is older 
have the right to have a decent retire-
ment? 
Don’t we have the right to be in a na-
tion of optimism where we told the 
truth about the math and our demo-
graphics, and then we provided an opti-
mistic vision that gets us there instead 
of the crazy stuff that has been posed 
this last 12 months that we keep show-
ing economists after economists—and 
these are not conservative economists. 
Many of them are from liberal groups 
saying: You do realize that Build Back 
Better by the end of the decade make 
people poorer? 
But it was great politics. Stop the 
crazy. Buy a calculator, and then if we 
do it by math, I think you could actu-
ally see this body work together be-
cause an optimistic vision can be ours 
if we just fixate on the disruptions that 
make the future great. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
RECOGNIZING OXFORD MICHIGAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. SLOTKIN) is recognized 
for 30 minutes. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the community of 
Oxford Michigan located in my district 
in Oakland County. 
As everyone knows, last year on No-
vember 30, Oxford suffered the worst 
sort of tragedy when a student at the 
town’s high school brought a gun to 
school and used it to shoot a teacher 
and 10 fellow students. 
The community lost four beautiful, 
kind, talented and beloved young peo-
ple that day: Madisyn Baldwin, Tate 
Myre, Justin Shilling, and Hana St. Ju-
liana. I had the honor of attending the 
funerals for Justin and Hana and the 
visitation for Madisyn, and witnessing 
the outpouring of love for them from 
hundreds and hundreds in their com-
munity was inspiring. 
The United States, unfortunately, 
has seen many of these shooting in the 
past 25 years but nothing prepares a 
community for being the one where it 
happens. In Oxford, the wounded from 
that terrible day extends far beyond 
the teacher and six students who were 
shot. The entire community has suf-
fered a devastating and life-changing 
trauma. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about 
what that means and what I hope we 
will do to support the people of Oxford 
and its neighboring communities in the 
months and years ahead, because it 
will take years to heal. 
First, I want to share with you some 
of the stories from Oxford from the last 
2 months. In the aftermath of the 
shooting, the community was deter-
mined to be ‘‘Oxford Strong.’’ The peo-
ple I have met and sat with and lis-
tened to in the past couple of months 
have 
made 
it 
clear 
that 
‘‘Oxford 
Strong’’ isn’t just a catchphrase. 
Strong, in Oxford, is about compas-
sion, about caring about asking for 
help when you need it, and finding a 
way to help your neighbors even if it 
comes at a real cost to yourself. 
To our local small businesses, which, 
in the days after the shooting, went to 
great lengths and great expense to pro-
vide families with support and a safe 
haven. It started with the local Meijer, 
which closed the day of the shooting to 
provide a gathering place for students 
fleeing 
the 
building. 
Meijer 
had 
partnered with Oxford schools to be 
part of their emergency evacuation 
plan so students knew exactly where to 
go when the building became unsafe. 
By the next day, Sick Pizza had of-
fered to donate 100 percent of their pro-
ceeds from pizza sales over several days 
to victims’ families. Owner Scott Tay-
lor hoped to raise about $25,000. In-
stead, his restaurant raised four times 
that amount. 
Oxford Bank sprang into action offer-
ing to collect donations for the victims 
so that the community would have a

trusted, central location to direct its 
generosity. To date, more than $1.6 
million has poured in and the bank has 
enlisted the National Compassion Fund 
to ensure it is distributed thoughtfully, 
fairly, and transparently. 
And though I am only scratching the 
surface of the local business commu-
nity’s generosity, I would be remiss not 
to mention Legacy Center and its 
many tenant businesses which offered 
services entirely for free for several 
days and became a community gath-
ering spot for grieving teens through-
out December. 
As recently as a couple of weeks ago, 
the Legacy Center provided a space for 
my staff and I to meet with a group of 
Oxford parents and educators for a lis-
tening session. They continue to be 
true partners to people of Oxford. 
For the remarkable contributions 
made by our local small businesses in 
the wake of this tragedy, I read the 
statement into the people’s House so 
that it may be remembered in per-
petuity. 
To our elected local leaders, we find 
out what people are made of in difficult 
times. Local Oxford Village President 
Joe Madore, Oxford Township Presi-
dent Jack Curtis, and Orion Township 
Supervisor 
Chris 
Barnett, 
you 
re-
sponded immediately to the crisis fac-
ing your community working tireless 
in the shooting’s aftermath to provide 
anything and everything you could, 
from meals for students returning to 
school because all the stored food had 
perished, to clear backpacks to en-
hance security. 
Jack Curtis opened the township 
doors to me personally, giving me 
space to conduct a virtual townhall 
meeting. Your helpers were too many 
to count, but their actions in those ini-
tial days will never be forgotten. 
For the remarkable contributions 
made by our local leaders in the wake 
of this tragedy I read the statement 
into the people’s House so that it may 
be remembered in perpetuity. 
To the first responders, though the 
story of the Oxford shooting is, of 
course, a horrific one, one part of the 
story has brought many families and 
the larger community comfort, and 
that was your incredible actions on 
that day. More than 30 agencies re-
sponded to the school that day from all 
levels of government, many arriving 
little more than moments after the 911 
calls began. You were incredibly brave, 
and your expertly coordinated effort, 
we know, undoubtedly saved lives. 
During the time I spent in Oxford, I 
have had the honor of meeting with 
many of you, starting with Oakland 
County Sheriff Mike Bouchard and 
Deputy Sheriff Mike McCabe, who just 
retired. I also met Oxford Police Chief 
Mike Solwold who started his career as 
a school liaison officer in Oxford and 
who worked literally nonstop in the 
shooting’s aftermath; and Oxford Fire 
Chief Peter Scholz and Lieutenant 
Mike Majestic who, despite the grief of 
witnessing the death of young people 
whom they had known for years, kept 
showing up to serve their beloved com-
munity, including working as valuable 
partners at emergency management 
planning meetings every week to ad-
dress public safety, mental health, 
funding, 
and 
other 
needs 
for 
the 
schools and surrounding communities. 
I spoke with Lake Orion Police Chief 
Harold Rossman and Lieutenant Todd 
Stanfield who helped secure the build-
ing and who tried desperately to save 
one of the victims, and who spoke elo-
quently of the impact limited mental 
health services have on the commu-
nity. And I met with Orion Township 
Fire Rescue Department led by Chief 
Robert Duke who also responded to the 
scene and who, like many of their col-
leagues, pressed on in the days after in 
the face of their own grief with little 
respite. 
At the funeral for Hana St. Juliana I 
sat with Lieutenant Gregory Glover 
and 
Detective 
Sergeant 
Richard 
Hubble, both of the Oakland County 
Sheriff’s Office, whose mere presence 
was a comfort to me personally and to 
so many others on that incredibly sad 
night. 
I had the chance to see them again 
during a recent visit to town. Both 
men were among the first to enter the 
building along with Deputy John Mac-
Donald, who put Tate Myre in his vehi-
cle in a heroic effort to save him. 
Down the street from the sheriff’s 
substation is the Brandon Township 
Fire Department which I visited at the 
invitation of Lieutenant Doug Brice. 
He and his fellow firefighters entered 
the building directly behind law en-
forcement and did everything they 
could to aid the wounded. 
All of these men, like so many others 
on that day, stayed focused and calm 
in the face of real terror, and by doing 
so not only saved lives but provided 
comfort to terrified students who, no 
doubt, will forever view first respond-
ers differently, having been so well pro-
tected and shepherded to safety when 
they needed it most. 
For the remarkable bravery dis-
played by our first responders in the 
wake of this tragedy, I read the state-
ment into the people’s House so that it 
may be remembered in perpetuity. 
To the parents and students of Ox-
ford, I want to recognize you most of 
all. I have met with many of you in re-
cent weeks, sometimes in hours-long 
sessions, to hear how you are doing and 
what you need most. And it is clear 
what you need from the rest of us is to 
listen. I have heard from parents whose 
children are worried they will fall be-
hind in school if they don’t attend, but 
who find going to class in the same 
building where they fled bullets and 
friends were hurt or killed just a few 
weeks ago to be hard to tolerate. 
I have heard from students who now 
wince at loud sounds and get over-
whelmed by crowds, who are worried 
about their friends and themselves and 
who feel overlooked. Many have told 
me they badly want to get the mental 
health support that they need but their 
parents can’t afford a therapist and 
they are tired of telling and retelling 
their story of the crisis. 
The fact is, everyone in Oxford has 
post-traumatic stress. Everyone. There 
is no escaping the impact of this im-
mense and overwhelming tragedy. But 
I want you to know that post-trau-
matic stress does not have to become 
post-traumatic stress disorder. With 
proper support, traumatized people can 
recover. You may never be exactly the 
same as you once were, but you can 
discover new reserves of strength and 
renewed appreciation for life and for 
your loved ones. 
Psychologists have a term for this. It 
is called post-traumatic stress growth. 
It is a theory that holds that people 
who endure intense trauma can see 
positive growth come from their des-
perate struggle. 
But that doesn’t happen overnight, 
and it doesn’t happen without a lot of 
hard work and help. The people of Ox-
ford, though incredibly resilient in the 
face of staggering loss, need our sup-
port. ‘‘Oxford Strong’’ does not mean 
Oxford can or should do it alone. I have 
heard from teachers who tell me they 
can’t 
possibly 
provide 
the 
mental 
health support that some of their stu-
dents need. 
Schools have precious few social 
workers on staff and troubled students 
have effectively nowhere to go in a 
State with fewer than 300 psychiatric 
beds in the entire State, all of which 
have long waiting lists. So kids with 
serious 
emotional 
and 
behavioral 
issues often must stay in class with lit-
tle support, causing challenges for 
their peers and unable to get the inter-
vention they so badly need. 
I have heard from nearly everyone 
that we need to make sure at the very 
least that we keep guns out of the 
hands of our kids. The shooting at Ox-
ford High School made it very clear 
that we have a serious, systemic prob-
lem to solve. But in the meantime, the 
least we can do is ensure that kids 
don’t have access to guns. I am not 
talking about families who teach their 
kids how to hunt, which in Michigan is 
very common. I grew up in a gun-own-
ing household. I am talking about leav-
ing a deadly weapon unsecured. We 
must do everything we can to keep our 
kids safe, and that is one easy and cru-
cial step we can take. 
I wasn’t able to be in Oxford last Fri-
day night. The Michigan High School 
Athletic Association organized an Ox-
ford Strong night and across the State. 
Teams playing their Friday night 
games showed their support and love 
for the people of Oxford. The MHSAA 
raised $200,000 for the victims and their 
families with its effort. That kind of 
ongoing love and support is so heart-
ening to see. I am standing here today 
asking all of us to continue to hold Ox-
ford in our hearts, and to do the hard 
work necessary to ensure its people get 
the resources they need to recover, and 
to ensure no other community suffers 
such a needless and devastating event.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1071 
February 8, 2022 
It is the honor of my life to represent 
the people of Oxford in the U.S. House 
of Representatives and to be able to 
speak their stories of resilience into 
the permanent record of the people’s 
House. 
In the face of unimaginable adver-
sity, you have shown us a path forward 
on the road to recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

b 2000 
ISSUES LARGELY UNTOUCHED BY 
AMERICAN MEDIA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, to-
night, we are going to address three 
what I consider key issues that have 
sadly been left largely untouched by 
the American media. 
The first one is the penalties against 
married couples in income transfer 
payments and the degree to which 
these income transfer payments are 
going to be affected by the Build Back 
Better bill, if any of that survives for 
passage at the end of the year. 
We know that Karl Marx wanted to 
destroy the American family. We know 
for a while, last year, Black Lives Mat-
ter, which was so important in last 
year’s campaign, had on their website 
that they wanted to destroy the West-
ern-prescribed nuclear family. As a 
practical matter, this means they 
wanted to keep the man out of the 
house. 
People might wonder why I keep 
bringing this up. It seems like old 
news. I would feel better if some Demo-
crat stepped forward and publicly con-
demned Marxism and publicly praised 
the idea that children may benefit 
from having a father at home. But that 
is not going on. 
In America, before Lyndon Johnson 
came in with his Great Society, or war 
on marriage, whatever you want to call 
it, all but 7 percent of American chil-
dren started out with both parents. 
Now, I know wonderful single par-
ents. I know children who became won-
derful adults raised by single parents. 
But nevertheless, the statistics again 
and again show, whatever metric you 
have, you might be better off or it 
might be easier to raise that child with 
two parents at home. 
After the Gingrich reforms in the 
1990s, that number has since stayed at 
about 40 percent of children born with-
out both parents at home. So it went 
from 7 percent to 40 percent, a steady 
increase 35 years after Lyndon Johnson 
passed his war on marriage bills in the 
1960s. Things have been relatively stat-
ic for the last 25 years. 
Now, in my opinion, the reason the 
number of families with both parents 
at home dropped is because most gov-
ernment transfer payments are condi-
tioned upon not having a lot of income 
or not having a major breadwinner in 
the house. 
There are about 90 government trans-
fer payments this is true of. But some 
of the ones that the average person 
should be aware of are SNAP, the food 
stamp program; the low-income hous-
ing program; the earned income tax 
credit program; the Pell grants; and 
the TANF program. All of these pro-
grams are designed to disappear if you 
have a person who makes an average 
income in the household. 
In Build Back Better, the earned in-
come tax credit goes up. Joe Biden in-
creased the food stamp benefits on his 
own, and there will be large increases 
in the amount of low-income housing 
available. 
I want to point out one of the pro-
grams, by the way, that we used to 
build more low-income housing. It is 
called section 42 housing. It is funded 
by very generous tax credits, which 
come from, obviously, very wealthy 
property developers. As a practical 
matter, the government winds up pay-
ing for over 80 percent of the housing 
that a private person gets through the 
tax credits. So one of the primary ben-
efits of this form of low-income hous-
ing is we are, quite frankly, making 
the rich richer. It is one of the big tax 
benefits that helps the wealthier peo-
ple. 
In section 42, because so much of the 
housing is paid for by the government, 
the person who does the building has 
every incentive to make that property 
as expensive as it can be. We are glad 
the Chair is listening here because it is 
something I didn’t know about until 
about 6 years ago. 
It creates a situation in which a de-
veloper who is building low-income 
housing can outbid another developer 
for prime land, and they can build fan-
cier countertops, that sort of thing, be-
cause the government is paying for 80 
percent of it. So if you are somebody 
like me, who sometimes thinks our tax 
code does benefit the ultrawealthy, sec-
tion 42 is one of those provisions. 
Pell grants are another example of a 
program that you can benefit from, ei-
ther you or your children, provided no-
body in the household is making too 
much money. It is another program 
therefore designed—as one mother told 
me: Me and my husband work. My poor 
kids have to take out such big student 
loans. Is it fair we are penalized for 
being married and working? 
That is the way that program is set 
up. It is designed to penalize the old- 
fashioned family, which is what Karl 
Marx would have wanted. 
It is not unusual to have situations 
in which the penalty for getting mar-
ried can be as much as $14,000. Like I 
said, as we have more low-income hous-
ing, as we up the earned income tax 
credit, these programs are pushing, I 
think, America in the wrong direction. 
I will direct people who are listening 
to recent studies that have been put 
out by The Heritage Foundation and 
Robert Rector, who has long been an 
expert in this field, describing the de-
gree to which the penalty on people 
who get married goes up. 
Now, I would hope, for children in the 
future, that we don’t continue down 
this path of apparently penalizing both 
parents for staying in the home. I hope 
it is something that is looked at by Re-
publicans if we get the majority, and I 
hope more Democrats look into this be-
fore we add too many other benefits 
conditioned upon a low-income situa-
tion if Build Back Better is passed. 
Again, I think it would be good if the 
press, which hasn’t so far—but I would 
hope the press would pick up on Mr. 
Rector’s paper and comment on how 
America will change if more and more 
benefits are targeted at people who are 
not married with children. 
I think this is one of the key stories 
in America over the last 50 years. I 
hear a lot of people back home, when 
they feel that America is not quite as 
enjoyable to live in as it was 50 years 
ago, that one of those reasons is what 
they would refer to as the breakdown 
of the traditional family. I hope, after 
hearing my explanation tonight, more 
people realize that that was not nec-
essarily by accident. There are evil, 
leftwing people who want to break 
down the family, and the public policy 
of the American Government right now 
is to use their financial incentives to 
penalize the average family. 
Now, the next issue that, if we look 
15 years down the road—and I always 
think when we take up issues or ad-
dress issues or decide how to vote on 
issues, we should say: How is this going 
to affect America not only today but 15 
years from now? 
I do believe that the screwed-up wel-
fare system continues to chip away at 
America. But I would say the second- 
biggest—maybe the biggest—issue is 
what is going on at our southern bor-
der. 
Earlier today, I had the chance to 
talk to a member of the Border Patrol, 
who appeared here in the Capitol. Hav-
ing seen the border five times last 
year, I thought I had my fill of bad 
things that are going on. But talking 
to him as far as what is going on right 
now, it is worse than ever. They are 
seeing more people and more drug 
gangs operating near the border. 
We are at a point in which we are not 
only seeing Mexican drug gangs hang-
ing out in California, fighting for the 
marijuana fields that are apparently 
popping up in California, but they are 
now fighting with Chinese gangs. I 
mean, I have been down there several 
times. I have yet to see them, but this 
Border Patrol agent told me what we 
have going on in California is violent 
conflict between Mexican gangs and 
Chinese gangs, and they are becoming 
more aggressive. 
You didn’t used to see people coming 
to the border shooting at Border Patrol 
agents, but that is what we are getting 
now. In the past, when I have been

February 8, 2022 
down there, they would avoid the Bor-
der Patrol agents. Now, you really 
have to look out. 
I mention that because I think as we 
work our way through a continuing 
resolution today and work toward the 
budget, we had better do something to 
help out the Border Patrol. 
The Border Patrol right now has to 
deal with a lot more people than they 
did a year ago. When President Biden 
took office, there were about 20,000 peo-
ple coming across here every month. 
We are now at about 90,000 every 
month, including a lot more unaccom-
panied children. 
Obviously, when people turn them-
selves in at the southern border, which 
they do under our asylum policy, the 
Border Patrol agents have to drop what 
they are doing, ignore the border, and 
do the paperwork. There is even more 
paperwork when we have unaccom-
panied minors coming to the southern 
border because then we have to check 
out the young children, and we ship 
them around the country, wherever 
they have to go. 
Now, this drives the Border Patrol up 
the wall—right?—because if somebody 
in this room took their children and 
dropped them off at the Washington, 
D.C., airport and just told the South-
west ticket agent, ‘‘Oh, here is Johnny. 
Send him to somebody in Portland, Or-
egon,’’ social services would be after 
those people. Why are you letting those 
people go? 
But at the southern border, it doesn’t 
work that way. If Johnny shows up at 
the southern border and has on his T- 
shirt, ‘‘I want to go to 14 East Elm 
Street, Portland, Oregon,’’ we deliver 
him to 14 East Elm Street, Portland, 
Oregon, no questions asked. I mean, 
presumably, Johnny knows those peo-
ple. Hopefully, it is an aunt and uncle 
or grandparents. Hopefully, it is some-
body, but we don’t know for sure. 
That is the reason there is a report 
that the U.S. Government will lose 
track of one in three unaccompanied 
alien children it releases to sponsors 
into the country. We don’t even know 
where these kids are. 
I don’t know, for whatever reason— 
maybe it is that they like the current 
administration—there are not banner 
headlines about this, but there should 
be banner headlines about it. Like I 
said, if it were our own children just 
released to the airlines to go around 
the country, we would be concerned. 
I have been at the southern border. I 
have watched as I flew out of McAllen, 
Texas, and watched all the people get-
ting on the airplanes, children getting 
on the airplane, and people getting on 
the 
plane 
without 
identification. 
Again, you and I, we have to turn in 
our driver’s license. ‘‘Here I am. Can 
you let me get back to Milwaukee?’’ 
That is not the way it works with the 
illegal immigrants. They are let in, and 
it is a recipe for trouble. 
But the one primary thing I took out 
today was, again, the large number of 
people coming into the country. 
I should point out, too—and this says 
something about the administration’s 
motivation. In the first 6 months of 
last year, about 85 percent less people 
were deported than 3 years ago. Some 
of that can be attributed to COVID, but 
we largely know how to deal with 
COVID today. 
So, you begin to get even more sus-
picious of the administration, that not 
only are they greatly increasing the 
number of people who come into the 
country, but they are dramatically de-
creasing the number of people with 
criminal records who are being de-
ported from the country. How can 
America survive? 
Again, when I look at Congress, when 
I look at what we should do, I say: 
What effect is this going to have over 
the next 15 years? 
We are right now accepting people 
who we know very little about. I men-
tioned they don’t need IDs. The last 
time I was down at the southern bor-
der, you looked at a path, which was 
maybe as wide as this table, and it was 
littered with ID’s as people from wher-
ever—Venezuela, 
Colombia, 
Chili, 
wherever—throw their ID’s out, I guess 
because they want to start a new life 
and don’t want the American govern-
ment to know who they are, I guess. 
That is how we are changing Amer-
ica. That is how we are determining 
who the new people coming into Amer-
ica are, rather than, if we really want 
to, doing something under the current 
system where people have to check in, 
where people are monitored, where 
there is some vetting process. 
b 2015 
Why you would do it this way if you 
cared about the future of America, I 
don’t know. And I felt more sorry than 
ever for some of the people in Cali-
fornia who are having these drug gangs 
buy up houses, sometimes at height-
ened rates, but are also buying up 
houses that they are using for their op-
erations. Of course, very quickly, those 
neighborhoods change if you have drug 
cartels owning houses in a given area. 
Now, I am going to address one final 
issue tonight, and I am a little frus-
trated at the media not bringing it up. 
As I have said before, I am not the 
most hawkish person on the Ukraine- 
Russian situation, but since Russia and 
Ukraine are in the news, you would fig-
ure the media, including the conserv-
ative media, which hasn’t been that 
loud about it, but any impartial media 
person would take it upon themselves 
to talk about the Ukrainian famine. 
In the early 1930s, Joseph Stalin and 
the Soviet Union controlled what hap-
pened in Ukraine, and they were mad 
at Ukraine because some people in 
Ukraine wanted to be independent and 
hadn’t been under the Communist heel 
enough. 
Ukraine was a very wealthy region as 
far as agriculture was concerned, so in 
order to punish the Ukrainians or 
make sure the Soviet Union took over 
Ukraine, they instituted a famine. 
They wouldn’t let Ukrainians leave the 
country. They took over the crops in 
Ukraine. It dramatically differs if you 
look up the numbers, but somewhere 
between, say, 4 and 15 million people 
starved to death in Ukraine in the 
early 1930s. 
Now, isn’t that news? If you were a 
well-informed, well-read American who 
went to middle school, went to high 
school, 
maybe 
did 
some 
college, 
shouldn’t you know that 4 to 14 million 
Ukrainians were starved to death by 
the Soviet Union in the early 1930s? 
But I talk to people. I talk to people 
in this building. I talk to people back 
home. Somehow, nobody knows it. 
Well, maybe that has something to do 
with some of the animosity between 
Ukrainians and the Russians. Regard-
less, it is something every American 
should know so they know why people 
like me are a little bit concerned when 
we are nice to groups founded by Marx-
ists or when a U.S. Senator from Con-
necticut shows up at an anniversary 
for the Communist Party of America 
and thinks it is no big deal and we can 
just laugh it off. 
There are many, many things wrong 
with communism. Suppression of free 
speech and the free flow of ideas is one 
of the things that is scary. It was not 
uncommon in places like Red China or 
the Soviet Union early on to wipe out 
all houses of worship. That is some-
thing that we find scary, as well as 
complete government control of the 
economy and a situation in which they 
determine that your success economi-
cally will, to a certain extent, be de-
pendent upon following the line and 
bowing to the government. 
I cannot imagine a worse form of 
government than that of communism. 
It is horrible, even without the mass 
murders. But every American child 
should know about the great Ukrainian 
famine of 1931 and 1932 and the millions 
of people who died, both so they are 
knowledgeable on Marxism or com-
munism and to know a little bit about 
historic Ukrainian-Russian relations. 
So, I beg our media to recount what 
happened. It would be a good time to 
recount what happened for the Amer-
ican public, and I hope in the future 
members of the American education 
system do a little bit better job of ex-
plaining some of the horrific things 
that happened in history. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Let us pray. 
Majestic God, who owns the world 
and everything in it, we honor Your 
Holy Name. Lord, You laid the founda-
tions of the oceans and surrounded us 
with beauty. You permit us to daily 
borrow our heartbeats from You. Con-
tinue to bless and guide our lawmakers 
as they look to You for wisdom. May 
Your precepts provide a lamp for their 
feet and a light for their path. 
Lord, guide them as they travel like

their needs out of the abundance of 
Your celestial riches. 
We pray in Your triumphant Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Biden administration spent the end of 
last week boasting that our economy 
added back more jobs in January than 
some economists had predicted, but 
American families aren’t buying their 
spin. 
The working men and women of this 
country know painfully well that the 
Biden administration’s economy is fail-
ing them. One typical recent survey 
showed a majority of Americans dis-
approve of the President’s job perform-
ance, and Democrats’ poor handling of 
the economy is a major factor. 
So let’s be clear. The country was al-
ways—always—guaranteed to add back 
jobs following the 2020 COVID reces-
sion. The Biden administration did not 
create the vaccines, it did not create 
this milder variant, and it is not owed 
particular credit for the fact that our 
economy is continuing to climb out of 
the 
crater 
caused 
by 
the 
2020 
lockdowns. 
Our trajectory of adding back jobs 
has stayed remarkably consistent from 
late 2020 up through today. Job growth 
under President Biden has just kept 
bumping along the trajectory that he 
inherited—notwithstanding that Demo-
crats blew trillions of dollars on sup-
posedly job-creating policies in the 
meantime. 
There has been no noticeable accel-
eration in job growth relative to the 
baseline 
that 
was 
forecast 
before 
Democrats took power, but inflation, 
on the other hand, has absolutely 
soared relative to those forecasts. Con-
sumer prices exploded by 7 percent in 
2021—the worst inflation in 40 years. 
More than 80 percent of Americans say 
the cost of everyday goods have shot 
up, and two-thirds disapprove of the 
job President Biden is doing to help 
their wallets. 
Even though American workers have 
been earning pay raises, inflation is 
leaving them with less purchasing 
power than they had in the first place. 
Once you factor in inflation, the aver-
age American has gotten a 2-percent

real pay cut—cut—under Democratic 
policies. According to one calculation, 
only in one single sector across the en-
tire economy did wage growth outpace 
inflation last year. That was leisure 
and hospitality, as those incredibly 
hard-hit sectors rebounded from their 
especially nightmarish 2020. Everyone 
else, on average, got a pay cut. 
The average retail worker got an in-
flation pay cut; same with miners and 
loggers—inflation pay cuts. Construc-
tion workers, manufacturing workers, 
and transportation workers got infla-
tion pay cuts, and on and on. Ameri-
cans know that Democrats’ failed poli-
cies are the reason. 
ISIS 
Mr. President, now, on another mat-
ter, last week, the U.S. military took 
another top terrorist leader off the bat-
tlefield. This particular leader had 
been ISIS’s top militant since 2019, 
when American special operators intro-
duced his predecessor to a similar fate. 
I am proud of our special operations 
personnel who took on this dangerous 
mission. President Biden deserves cred-
it for making the tough call to send 
U.S. servicemembers into harm’s way. 
Until this terrorist chose to kill him-
self and take innocent citizens with 
him, their mission had been to capture 
him alive for interrogation. That is an 
encouraging sign. If the past 20 years of 
counterterrorism have taught us any-
thing, it is that just taking out top 
leaders does little to uproot their net-
works. This terrorist could have been a 
source of valuable information for de-
stroying ISIS. 
But this aspect of last week’s mission 
also raises a question for our Com-
mander in Chief. If President Biden 
recognizes the value of detaining top 
terrorists, then why are his staff still 
caught up in the longstanding liberal 
obsession with shutting down our de-
tention center at Guantanamo Bay? 
The White House said last year that 
closing Gitmo was ‘‘certainly our goal 
and our intention,’’ but last week, U.S. 
forces undertook this mission that was 
designed to take this terrorist mur-
derer alive for detention and ques-
tioning. So how exactly was the Biden 
administration 
planning 
to 
square 
their political quest to close Guanta-
namo with their stated intention to 
capture this terrorist alive? Where 
were they planning to house this kill-
er—a Holiday Inn? Did they intend to 
turn this guy over to a nonstate, third- 
party partner like the Syrian defense 
forces? That would have created new 
risks of another major ISIS prison 
break. And would his jailers have 
obeyed the Geneva Conventions? What 
if the Syrian regime—itself a state 
sponsor of terror—retakes that part of 
Syria? Or was the administration plan-
ning on bringing him before U.S. 
courts, under article III of our Con-
stitution? Did the FBI come along on 
the raid to read this foreign terrorist 
his Miranda rights? Was their plan to 
eventually give this sworn killer the 
same rights as U.S. citizens and risking 
the possibility of a jailbreak attack on 
our own American soil? Or perhaps the 
correct answer—Guantanamo Bay—was 
their plan all along. Maybe the Demo-
crats’ virtue signaling about closing 
this important facility has finally 
given way to reality. 
Guantanamo is a highly secure, hu-
mane, and entirely legal place to de-
tain terrorists. It would have been the 
safest place to interrogate this ter-
rorist, well within the bounds of the 
laws of war. 
Any Democrats who want to shutter 
it should look closely at the reality of 
the Syrian defense forces’ makeshift 
prisons, like the major jailbreak by 
hardcore ISIS figures that just hap-
pened in Hasakah. They should remem-
ber the massive ISIS prison break when 
the Taliban overran Bagram in Afghan-
istan. 
So if President Biden is pumping the 
brakes on his own plans to close 
Gitmo, he should say so, and I will be 
the first to applaud him. If he isn’t, he 
owes the country some answers about 
his intentions with last week’s raid and 
our national security going forward. 
September 11 taught us definitively 
that we cannot treat terrorism as 
merely a law enforcement challenge. I 
hope and pray it does not come to pass 
that this administration is forced to 
relearn that lesson the hard way. 
This war against terrorists will not 
end simply because we hope it ends. It 
will require sustained pressure to keep 
our enemies off balance. 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
yesterday, the House of Representa-
tives introduced legislation to keep the 
Federal Government open and funded 
through mid-March. Avoiding a govern-
ment shutdown in the near term is an 
obvious, commonsense step. But our 
military commanders and their civil-
ian bosses badly need our country to 
escape the hamster wheel of chronic 
continuing 
resolutions. 
The 
urgent 
task of continuing to modernize and 
strengthen our military requires pre-
dictable budgeting and advanced plan-
ning. So I am glad the bipartisan, bi-
cameral conversations about a long- 
term 
funding 
agreement 
are 
con-
tinuing. 
Let me briefly reiterate some basic 
facts that are known to everybody here 
in Congress. I have been saying since 
last year that three basic boxes will 
need to be checked for a government 
funding deal to pass the Senate and 
make it to the President’s desk. 
No. 1, the agreement will need to 
honor 
the 
longstanding, 
bipartisan 
norm that spending growth for our na-
tional defense receives parity—parity— 
with spending growth for nondefense. 
We live in a world that is too dan-
gerous for Democrats to go hog-wild on 
domestic programs and welfare. In-
stead, we need to refocus our attention 
on resourcing our great-power competi-
tions with Russia and China in equal 
measure. 
No. 2, any agreement will need to 
preserve longstanding, bipartisan pol-
icy riders. Again, this is just the bipar-
tisan norm. The Hyde amendment pre-
vents taxpayers from having to fund 
abortions against their will. Another 
rider 
prevents 
the 
IRS 
from 
weaponizing political bias and tar-
geting citizens. In a 50–50 Senate, we 
obviously need to honor the bipartisan 
status quo on legacy riders. 
No. 3, likewise, any agreement will 
need to keep new partisan poison pills 
out of the process. 
That has been the big picture for 
months now—parity for defense, keep-
ing longstanding bipartisan policy rid-
ers in, and keeping new poison pills 
out. With these basic things, a bipar-
tisan deal should be achievable. With-
out them, it will be impossible. 
I thank Ranking Member SHELBY for 
his tireless work. I hope our Demo-
cratic colleagues in both Chambers will 
fully embrace this noncontroversial 
framework, which has been clear to ev-
erybody literally for months, so that 
Congress can soon deliver the full-year 
funding that our servicemembers need 
to keep us safe. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the order for the quorum call 
be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, our colleagues in the House in-
troduced legislation that will provide a 
temporary extension of government 
funding until March 11. The continuing 
resolution is expected to be taken up as 
soon as today, and once it is passed by 
the House, I intend to have the Senate 
take it up quickly and in time before 
the February 18 deadline. 
While negotiations on the full-year 
funding agreement continue, we will in 
the meantime avoid a pointless and 
costly government shutdown. This CR 
provides a little more time to reach a 
deal for a spending package. It is the 
responsible and prudent path forward 
that eliminates the risk of a shutdown. 
My 
colleagues 
have 
made 
good 
progress, and I am optimistic that 
Democrats and Republicans can soon 
arrive at a top-line deal for an omni-
bus. I am more confident than ever be-
fore that we can reach agreement for 
an omnibus by March 11, which is far 
more preferable to the alternative, a 
CR for the rest of the year. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, now on nominations, 
today, the Senate will continue focus-
ing our responsibility to confirm more 
of President Biden’s nominees. 
By the end of today, we expect to fin-
ish the confirmation of four more 
nominees, including Amy Gutmann to

February 8, 2022 
serve in the pivotal role as U.S. Ambas-
sador to Germany. 
For the information of all Senators, 
there is a strong likelihood that a sig-
nificant number of additional votes 
will be held later today. If so, we want 
to make sure things keep moving 
briskly on the floor. Just as we did last 
week, I ask my colleagues to cast their 
votes quickly, to remain in their seats 
or near the floor as much as possible, 
and to be flexible in order to prevent 
extended delays. We did a good job of it 
last week, so let’s continue the pace 
this evening as well when we move for-
ward on more votes. 
Off the floor, it is an important day 
for my home State of New York when 
it comes to nominations. A few mo-
ments ago, it was my honor to come 
before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee and introduce Assembly-
man Nick Perry to serve as Ambas-
sador to Jamaica. I was also proud to 
introduce Randi Charno Levine to 
serve as U.S. Ambassador to Portugal. 
It would be impossible—impossible—to 
find a better fit for Ambassador to Ja-
maica than my friend Nick Perry, 
whom I urged the Biden administration 
to select for the post. 
Assemblyman Perry represents so 
much of what is good and promising 
about America: He is an immigrant; he 
is an Army veteran; he is a graduate of 
Brooklyn College and one of New 
York’s 
leading 
voices 
fighting 
for 
working families. He is a very, very fa-
miliar face in Brooklyn because he 
likes to do politics the old-fashioned 
way: shake hands, show up as much as 
possible, and just listen to people’s sto-
ries. 
When confirmed, Assemblyman Perry 
would make history as the first ever 
native-born Jamaican to serve as U.S. 
Ambassador. It is a truly important 
milestone and one that is long overdue, 
and it makes Brooklyn particularly 
proud. 
When I go through Brooklyn, I some-
times ask my constituents, particu-
larly at the West Indian Day Parade, I 
ask them: What is the largest island in 
the Caribbean? I tell him it is a trick 
question. Some people say Cuba. Some 
people say Haiti. Some people say Bar-
bados. 
I say, no, Brooklyn is the largest is-
land in the Caribbean because we have 
more Caribbean immigrants than just 
about anywhere else. And that is why 
Brooklyn, particularly, is so proud 
that Nick is going to become our Am-
bassador to Jamaica. Not only is he Ja-
maican-born, but he is a Brooklynite 
through and through. 
From Patrick Ewing to KRS-One, 
from Vice President KAMALA HARRIS to 
Congresswoman YVETTE CLARKE, to the 
late General Powell, Jamaican Ameri-
cans hold a key place in our Nation’s 
rich legacy. Nick Perry will continue 
to add to this legacy, as he has for dec-
ades. So I am so proud to support him 
and to recommend him as nominee for 
Ambassador to Jamaica. 
This morning, it was also my honor 
to introduce Randi Levine to become 
only the second woman to ever serve as 
Ambassador to Portugal. I have known 
Randi and her husband Jeff for over 30 
years. They have been longtime advo-
cates for many different communities 
across New York, especially our Jewish 
population. 
As chair of the Meridian Center for 
Cultural Diplomacy here in Wash-
ington, Randi has also been one of our 
top leaders for promoting cultural ex-
changes between students, diplomats, 
and business leaders. In other words, 
she has already advanced—in a dif-
ferent context—the work that any good 
Ambassador must accomplish: encour-
aging and fostering understanding be-
tween our country and people around 
the world. I have every bit of con-
fidence that Randi will represent the 
United States with distinction as an 
ambassador to Portugal, and she has 
my most enthusiastic support. 
Finally, I also want to recognize and 
commend the nomination of Professor 
Deborah Lipstadt to serve as the State 
Department’s Special Envoy to Mon-
itor and Combat Anti-Semitism, a posi-
tion that carries the rank of Ambas-
sador. 
Dr. 
Lipstadt’s 
leadership 
is 
des-
perately needed. The malicious poison 
of anti-Semitism must be confronted 
whenever it rears its ugly head. We 
have seen a spike of anti-Semitism 
here at home and abroad, making this 
position exceedingly important. 
As one of the Nation’s top scholars 
on the Holocaust and on modern-day 
anti-Semitism, Dr. Lipstadt ought to 
be confirmed as soon as possible, and I 
am glad she is receiving her confirma-
tion hearing today. 
FORCED ARBITRATION 
Mr. President, now last, on forced ar-
bitration, last night, Congress took an 
important and overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan step forward in the fight to elimi-
nate forced arbitration for victims of 
sexual harassment and assault. 
By a large, large margin—335 to 97— 
our House colleagues approved legisla-
tion that, for the first time ever, would 
ensure people who face sexual harass-
ment or assault at work have the free-
dom to hold employers accountable in 
court. It would eliminate the long-used 
practice of including forced arbitration 
clauses in employee contracts, which, 
for so long, have effectively served as a 
condition for employment. 
I commend my House colleagues for 
approving forced arbitration legisla-
tion with overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port. If you look at the vote, it is pret-
ty clear that a majority of both parties 
voted for this legislation. 
It is my intention to move on this 
bill as quickly as we can in the Senate, 
and we hope to take action here on the 
floor as soon as this week. I expect it 
will be met with nothing less than 
broad support from both parties, ena-
bling us to move quickly. 
The legislation has been years in the 
works, and I want to recognize my 
friend Senator GILLIBRAND, who has 
spearheaded the cause of ending forced 
arbitration on this issue for a long 
time. Thanks to her leadership, we are 
close to seeing this change become law. 
I also want to recognize Senator 
GRAHAM. Because of his backing and 
his work with Senator GILLIBRAND, this 
proposal has gotten the momentum it 
needs to move forward. 
Despite disagreements on both sides, 
legislation like this is a prime example 
of both parties finding a way to work 
together on legislation that will make 
a tangible difference in people’s lives. 
We want to work with our Republican 
colleagues on similar proposals when-
ever possible because at the end of the 
day, ending forced arbitration for sex-
ual harassment and assault is about 
making our workplaces safer, holding 
abusive employers accountable, and 
making sure that every American can 
exercise their right to justice in a 
court of law. 
For decades, abusers have used arbi-
tration as a shield for their horrific be-
havior. Employees have been put at 
massive disadvantage when trying to 
hold wrongdoers accountable. This law 
will finally change all that. 
I look forward to finishing the work 
of passing this bill through the Senate 
and getting it closer to the President’s 
desk. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
sure that you, more than most Mem-
bers of the Senate, remember our de-
bate a few weeks ago on the Voting 
Rights Act. I remember your state-
ment on the floor. It was powerful and 
really spoke to the truth of why we 
were meeting and debating this issue. 
We realize that, sadly, since the Civil 
War, when African Americans were fi-
nally given the right to vote, this has 
been a battle every year since. And 
yesterday, the Supreme Court decision 
tells us that we still have a battle to 
fight when it comes to voting rights in 
America. 
By a 5-to-4 vote yesterday, the Su-
preme Court’s conservative majority 
allowed Alabama lawmakers to move 
forward 
with 
a 
congressional 
dis-
tricting map that diminishes the power 
of Black voters in a State where Black 
Americans account for more than 25 
percent of the population. 
You see, this case had been consid-
ered by a three-judge district court 
panel in Alabama, and they ruled in a 
unanimous decision that the map like-
ly violated the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, and they ruled that we should 
block that map because it would vio-
late the right to vote of African Ameri-
cans. 
I might say, for the record, this 
three-judge panel, two of the three 
judges were appointed by former Presi-
dent Trump, and yet they came to that 
conclusion. So the Supreme Court had 
a decision of whether to go along with 
this three-judge panel and stop the im-
plementation of this map until they

February 8, 2022 
could have a full hearing on the subject 
or allow them to go forward. And, 
sadly, by a 5-to-4-vote, the Supreme 
Court’s conservative majority stayed a 
lower court’s decision, where they 
ruled unanimously that the district 
map was discriminatory. 
The Supreme Court did not issue a 
well-reasoned decision; they issued ba-
sically no reason. They did so on what 
is known as the shadow docket. We are 
seeing it more and more by this 
Court—no explanation, no full briefing, 
no signed opinion for the majority. 
What we have was a scant reaction by 
the Court. 
But I do want to note that Justice 
Kagan wrote that that decision by the 
Supreme Court in favor of allowing 
this Alabama map to go forward ‘‘does 
a disservice to the District Court, 
which 
meticulously 
applied 
this 
Court’s 
longstanding 
voting-rights 
precedent.’’ She went on to note that 
‘‘most of all, it does a disservice to the 
Black people of Alabama who under 
that precedent have had their electoral 
power diminished in violation of the 
law this Court once knew to buttress 
all of American democracy.’’ 
Yesterday’s decision is the latest ex-
ample of the Supreme Court hacking 
away the protections of the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965, one of the most im-
portant civil rights laws in our his-
tory—a law singularly responsible for 
decades of progress in minority rep-
resentation in public office. 
As a result of these decisions, legal 
protections for voters of color through-
out the country are being systemati-
cally dismantled by the Republican 
Party through State legislatures and, 
sadly, by our Federal courts. 
So now what do we do? Well, Con-
gress must act. We must restore the 
Voting Rights Act to its full power and 
potential, and we can do that by enact-
ing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act. 
This legislation would strengthen 
and modernize the Voting Rights Act’s 
protections, including by requiring Su-
preme Court Justices to actually ex-
plain their reasoning behind their deci-
sions when they overturn a lower 
court’s decision on a voting rights 
case. Is that too much to ask, that the 
Supreme Court explain to the Amer-
ican people why they are overruling a 
lower 
court’s 
decision 
which 
says 
Americans 
are 
being 
discriminated 
against when it comes to their right to 
vote? I don’t think the Supreme Court 
is that busy that it can’t tell the Amer-
ican people its logic behind these deci-
sions. 
Every day, we are seeing the con-
sequences of this Senate’s failure just a 
few weeks ago to protect the right to 
vote. Mr. President, you and I agree; 
we cannot wait any longer. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. President, let me address a re-
lated topic: 2022 is an election year. We 
know that well. And over the next 8 
months, both parties will have a 
chance to make our case to the Amer-
ican people for the November election, 
to engage in spirited, public debate 
about the issues that matter: the pan-
demic, the economy, and the chal-
lenges facing our country. 
But what happened last week in Salt 
Lake City, UT, is incredible. The Re-
publican Party made its opening move 
in this year’s election. Instead of offer-
ing a vision for the future of America, 
the Republican Party leaders meeting 
in Utah chose to attack democracy 
itself. 
On Friday, the Republican National 
Committee declared that the January 
6, 2021, insurrection was a form of ‘‘le-
gitimate political discourse.’’ This out-
rageous declaration, printed under the 
official letterhead of the Republican 
National Committee, is the saddest 
commentary on what Donald Trump 
and his acolytes have done to a great 
political party, the party of Abraham 
Lincoln. 
The violence that we personally wit-
nessed in this Chamber on January 6, 
2021, was deadly, seditious, and un- 
American—far from legitimate. Is that 
what we call the worst assault on the 
Capitol since the War of 1812? Was it le-
gitimate political discourse when the 
violent mob beat police officers with 
metal poles and assaulted them with 
bear spray? Was it political discourse 
that contributed to the death of five 
police officers who confronted that 
mob? Was it just merely political dis-
course when a defeated, embittered 
former President incited that mob to 
attack this Capitol Building and do its 
best to overturn the results of a free 
election, which he lost? No. It was an 
incitement to violence and an attack 
on our democracy. 
Let’s be clear: The Republican Par-
ty’s whitewashing of the insurrection 
isn’t just a pathetic capitulation to 
Donald Trump and his Big Lie; it is a 
dangerous revelation of the mindset of 
the leadership of America’s Republican 
Party. By legitimizing the insurrec-
tion, Republican Party leaders are ex-
ploring the use of violence and saying 
it is perfectly acceptable, it is legiti-
mate when it comes to the political 
goals. 
This is how democracies die. 
Last year, the intelligence commu-
nity warned that ‘‘narratives of fraud 
in the recent general election . . . will 
almost certainly spur some [domestic 
violent extremists] to try to engage in 
violence.’’ That came from our intel-
ligence community. This is not a hypo-
thetical. 
Over the past year, we have seen how 
the 
Big 
Lie, 
promulgated 
by 
the 
former, 
defeated 
President 
of 
the 
United States, has inspired his sup-
porters to commit and threaten violent 
acts. 
On Friday—the same day that the 
Republican Party declared that the in-
surrectionist mob was legitimate polit-
ical discourse—a Texas man appeared 
for his first day in court. That man is 
facing Federal charges for threatening 
to kill public officials in the home 
State of the Presiding Officer, the 
State of Georgia. 
What is exactly alleged to have hap-
pened? Well, the day before the Janu-
ary 6 insurrection, this man posted a 
message on the website Craigslist call-
ing for the murder of three election of-
ficials in Georgia. He wrote: ‘‘It’s our 
duty as American Patriots to put an 
end to the lives of these traitors and to 
take back our country by force. We can 
no longer wait on the corrupt law en-
forcement and the corrupt courts. If we 
want our country back we have to ex-
terminate these people.’’ 
The case against this man is the first 
case that has been brought forward by 
the 
Justice 
Department’s 
Election 
Threats Task Force, which the Depart-
ment established last June in response 
to the burgeoning threats of violence 
against election officials. But it is 
going to be far from the last case, un-
fortunately. Right now, the Depart-
ment of Justice is investigating dozens 
of similar cases. 
And less than 1 week after charging 
this Texas defendant, the Department 
also charged a man in Nevada who told 
an election worker that she was going 
to ‘‘die’’ because she played a part in 
‘‘stealing’’ the 2020 election from Don-
ald Trump. Thankfully, that election 
worker was not physically harmed, but 
she was shaken and disturbed by that 
declaration. 
She is not alone. Last April, the 
Brennan Center published a report 
finding that nearly one in five election 
officials 
in 
America 
had 
received 
threats because of their roles in the 
2020 election. One in three of these 
election officials says they worry for 
their safety because of the rising tide 
of political violence. Political violence. 
And the Republican National Com-
mittee describes it as ‘‘legitimate po-
litical discourse.’’ 
Is this the cost of participating in a 
democracy in Mr. Trump’s vision of 
America? Since the 2020 election, the 
former President and his supporters 
have latched on to the Big Lie to dis-
credit American democracy and the de-
cision of American voters and to go 
after those who work in it, like elec-
tion workers. 
But this is not the first time a mali-
cious lie has been used to foment dis-
trust, disdain, and even hatred for 
America’s public servants. It was 72 
years ago this week that Wisconsin 
Senator Joseph McCarthy delivered his 
infamous 
‘‘Enemies 
from 
Within’’ 
speech 
in 
Wheeling, 
WV. 
In 
that 
speech, Senator McCarthy pulled a 
sheet of paper out of his pocket, held it 
up to the crowd, and claimed he had a 
list of more than 50 names of Com-
munist agents who had infiltrated our 
government. These scurrilous accusa-
tions by Senator McCarthy made head-
lines 
and 
provoked 
nationwide 
hysteria. Rumors abounded about card- 
carrying Communists working within 
our government. 
And over the next 4 years, Senator 
McCarthy led a personal witch hunt

against public servants, journalists, 
members of the military, and average 
citizens. He destroyed lives in the proc-
ess. But he never revealed his list of 57 
names or any other credible evidence 
for his claims. Nonetheless, Senator 
Joe McCarthy discredited and defamed 
anyone standing in his way. He would 
accuse his opponents of being Com-
munists or Communist sympathizers if 
they publicly disagreed with him. 
With rare and notable exceptions— 
and one of them Senator Margaret 
Chase Smith, Republican Senator of 
Maine, and a few others—no one had 
the courage to question Joe McCarthy 
or challenge his wild allegations. Poli-
ticians were too afraid that he would 
turn on them next, so they remained 
quiet. 
And in the absence of opposition, he 
assumed 
even 
greater 
power—until 
1954, when some courageous members 
of Senator McCarthy’s own political 
party, the Republican Party, joined to-
gether with the Democrats in the Sen-
ate. They voted to condemn Senator 
McCarthy and the lies that had fueled 
his witch hunt. They stood in a bipar-
tisan majority to do it. With that vote, 
Senator Joseph McCarthy’s reign of 
terror was brought to an end. The press 
began to ignore him, and the public 
had had their fill. 
What will it take for our Republican 
colleagues today to say that they are 
done with the Big Lie of Trumpism? 
What will it take for them to reject it 
and renounce the normalization of po-
litical violence? What will it take for 
Republicans to admit that January 6 
was a deadly insurrection, not a ‘‘le-
gitimate political discourse’’? 
Americans of conscience of both po-
litical parties and Independents as well 
need to unite in support of the truth. 
That doesn’t mean we are going to 
agree on every issue. On the contrary, 
real debate is the lifeblood of our de-
mocracy. But we have to work from a 
shared set of facts and reality—like the 
fact that President Biden actually won 
the 2020 election and there was no evi-
dence of widespread voter fraud. 
I want to commend my Republican 
colleagues who have been willing to 
speak the truth in the last few days. I 
know it can’t be easy. 
Over the weekend, Senator MITT 
ROMNEY, Senator BILL
CASSIDY, and 
Senator LISA
MURKOWSKI
spoke out 
against the Republican National Com-
mittee’s decision to censure Congress-
woman LIZ CHENEY and Congressman 
ADAM KINZINGER of Illinois for commit-
ting the unforgivable sin of inves-
tigating the violent assault against 
American democracy. Unfortunately, 
they are a small but courageous minor-
ity. The vast majority of my Repub-
lican colleagues remain silent while 
their party leaders declare January 6 
legitimate. 
And on Friday, former Vice President 
Pence 
publicly 
stated: 
‘‘President 
Trump is wrong . . . Under the Con-
stitution, I had no right to change the 
outcome of our election.’’ 
That simple, declarative statement 
of truth—that the Vice President can-
not singlehandedly overrule the will of 
the American people—is welcomed, but 
the fact that it drew outrage from 
former President Trump and his sup-
porters is a sad reflection on the re-
ality of today’s Republican Party. 
If the events leading up to January 6 
taught us anything, it is that aspiring 
authoritarians like Donald Trump will 
toss aside longstanding laws and values 
to cling to power. That is why for the 
past several months, a bipartisan group 
of Senators have been discussing a pro-
posal to modernize the Electoral Count 
Act, an obscure law that was at the 
heart of former President Trump’s ef-
forts to overturn the election. I have 
been working on this effort on our side 
with Senators KING
and KLOBUCHAR, 
and there is a bipartisan effort, on the 
same matter, taking place as well. 
By updating the Electoral Count Act, 
we can make clear that the Vice Presi-
dent does not have the power to reject 
a State’s lawfully appointed electors 
and overturn the results of an election. 
That is important, and I believe it is a 
promising sign that Democrats and Re-
publicans are going to join together in 
discussion of finally rewriting this an-
cient law. 
But I also want to be honest about 
the scope of threats facing our Amer-
ican democracy. At a moment when 
too many Republican Party leaders are 
legitimizing the January 6 insurrection 
and Republican State legislators are 
erecting new barriers to the ballot box, 
particularly for African Americans, we 
must have the courage to restore the 
Voting Rights Act. And we need to 
come together across party lines to de-
fend our democracy, condemn violence, 
and to live by the rule of law, not the 
rule of the mob. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I don’t 
need to tell anyone—except perhaps 
the Democratic Party here in Con-
gress—that our country has a major in-
flation problem. The first year of the 
Biden administration has been charac-
terized by a huge increase in inflation. 
Inflation is currently at a 40-year high. 
Let me just repeat that. Inflation is 
currently at a 40-year high. The last 
time inflation was this bad, ‘‘E.T.’’ was 
just premiering in movie theaters and 
‘‘Return of the Jedi’’ hadn’t even come 
out yet. 
Inflation is so bad that despite wage 
increases in 2021, Americans saw a de 
facto pay cut. A December survey by 
the New York Times found that just 17 
percent of Americans said their wages 
had kept up with inflation. 
The White House Chief of Staff may 
think inflation is ‘‘a high-class prob-
lem,’’ but for the mom at the grocery 
store wondering if she can afford to 
buy ground beef this week or for the 
young worker just starting out who is 
wondering if she can afford to fill up 
her car, inflation is a very real prob-
lem. 
Americans are struggling. They are 
facing huge price increases at the gro-
cery store; huge price increases at the 
gas pump; big increases in the cost of 
household goods, like furniture and 
bedding and laundry equipment; mas-
sive increases in the cost of fuel oil and 
gas service; higher electric bills; and 
on and on. 
Inflation is weighing down busi-
nesses, too, from larger businesses to 
family farms and ranches. A recent 
survey from the National Federation of 
Independent Business found that 22 
percent of small businesses consider in-
flation to be the biggest challenge fac-
ing their business, a 20-point increase 
from the beginning of 2021—a 20-point 
increase. 
It is no wonder that 69 percent of 
Americans disapprove of the Presi-
dent’s handling of inflation and 56 per-
cent disapprove of his handling of the 
economy. 
Inflation is a major burden for Amer-
ican families and businesses—a fact 
that seems utterly lost on members of 
the Democratic Party. While American 
families struggle, Democrats’ focus is 
on anything but inflation. 
What is worse, many Democrats are 
still hoping to pass elements of their 
reckless tax-and-spending spree, the so- 
called Build Back Better plan, despite 
the fact that it was a bloated Democrat 
spending spree that helped get us into 
this inflation mess in the first place. 
Yes, while the pandemic created infla-
tionary pressures, a big reason we are 
in our current inflation mess is because 
of Democrats’ decision to push through 
an unnecessary and partisan $2 trillion 
spending bill last March. 
When Democrats took office last Jan-
uary, inflation was well within an ac-
ceptable range, what is known as the 
target inflation rate. It might have 
stayed there had Democrats not de-
cided that they needed to pass a mas-
sive government spending spree under 
the guise of COVID relief and, I might 
add, mere weeks after Congress had al-
ready passed a major COVID bill. That 
is right. December 2020 saw Congress 
pass its fifth bipartisan COVID relief 
bill, and that one was a nearly $1 tril-
lion piece of legislation that met essen-
tially 
all 
current 
pressing 
COVID 
needs. But the ink was barely dry on 
the page before Democrats decided that 
they needed to take advantage of the 
COVID situation to pass yet another 
bill—this time, a hyperpartisan $1.9 
trillion piece of legislation packed with 
unnecessary government spending and 
payoffs to Democrat interest groups. 
Again, there were five bipartisan 
COVID bills, the last of which passed in 
December of 2020. It was a $1 trillion

February 8, 2022 
bill that took care of all the out-
standing COVID needs. Yet, within 
weeks, Democrats here in Congress 
were proposing another $2 trillion, 
most of which had little to do with 
COVID or the pandemic and a lot more 
to do with their partisan agenda. 
But the point is, the definition of 
‘‘inflation’’ is ‘‘too many dollars chas-
ing too few goods and services.’’ That 
is exactly the situation the Democrats 
helped 
create 
with 
their 
so-called 
American Rescue Plan. They sent too 
many Federal dollars into the econ-
omy, and the economy overheated as a 
result. Now we are sitting here with 
the worst inflation in 40 years, and in-
stead of trying to address our inflation 
crisis, Democrats still—still—want to 
double down on the strategy that 
helped get us into this mess in the first 
place. 
‘‘Reckless 
and 
irresponsible 
spending’’ is putting it mildly. 
In January, Senator TIM SCOTT and I 
introduced the Inflation Prevention 
Act, a bill to stop Congress from con-
sidering any legislation that contains 
new spending and is estimated to in-
crease inflation if the year-over-year 
inflation rate exceeds 41⁄2 percent. One 
would hope that legislation like this 
wouldn’t be necessary at a time when 
inflation far exceeds the target infla-
tion rate, but, as we have seen with 
Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spending 
spree, that isn’t the case. 
So Senator TIM SCOTT and I, along 
with several of our Republican col-
leagues, have introduced this bill, 
which would help prevent reckless 
spending legislation, like the Demo-
crats’ so-called Build Back Better Act, 
when inflation is high. 
Again, let me just point out that on 
top of a $2 trillion spending bill a year 
ago in March—less than a year ago in 
March—the 
Democrats’ 
prescription 
now is another $5 trillion in spending, 
financed in part with tax increases, 
which also fuels inflation, and about $3 
trillion in debt on top of the $30 trillion 
in debt we already have. 
So we have rampant pandemic infla-
tion, attributable largely to the mas-
sive spending bill passed on a partisan 
basis last March. Now, instead of tack-
ling inflation and putting policies in 
place that would help drive inflation 
down, the solution Democrats are pro-
posing is a $5 trillion spending bill. 
Americans are struggling. Every-
where they turn, they are facing higher 
prices, stretching their budgets to the 
limit. If Democrats really want to help 
American families, they should aban-
don 
the 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
spree once and for all and focus on 
mitigating damage they have already 
done with their inflationary spending. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
Senator 
MORAN and I be able to complete our 
remarks prior to the scheduled votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF RETA JO LEWIS 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
American manufacturing and support 
the nomination of Reta Jo Lewis to be 
President of the Export-Import Bank. 
As President of Ex-Im and chair of the 
Bank’s Board of Directors, Ms. Lewis 
will lead our Nation’s official export 
credit Agency as it supports U.S. work-
ers and manufacturers, especially in 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and throughout 
our country. Ex-Im’s job is to support 
American businesses in the face of 
competition—so often, unfair competi-
tion from countries like China. 
Ms. Lewis is the leader we need in 
the fight to help U.S. manufacturers 
compete globally. She has 25 years of 
distinguished leadership experience in 
international affairs, law, and public 
policy. She is a historic nominee as the 
first Black woman to lead Ex-Im. 
She serves as a senior fellow and di-
rector of congressional affairs at the 
German Marshall Fund, where she 
leads bipartisan efforts to strengthen 
transatlantic cooperation. Before join-
ing the German Marshall Fund, Ms. 
Lewis served in the Obama administra-
tion as the State Department’s first- 
ever Special Representative for Global 
Intergovernmental Affairs. 
She will put American workers and 
exporters first. That has been the hall-
mark of this administration—putting 
workers at the center of our govern-
ment; putting workers at the center of 
our economic policy. 
Ms. Lewis understands that Ex-Im is 
vital to these manufacturing jobs and 
our Nation’s economic competitive-
ness. 
There are some 100 export credit 
agencies and credit programs around 
the world that support foreign manu-
facturers. China’s export finance activ-
ity is larger—China’s is larger—than 
all the export credit provided by the G7 
countries combined. That alone is rea-
son to move forward on Ex-Im. We 
know that the Chinese Government 
used export credit as a weapon to win 
manufacturing business in critical sec-
tors and to undermine American com-
panies and American workers. We must 
be in a better position to compete. 
We have had so much good job news 
in Ohio over the last few weeks. It is 
not a coincidence that for the first 
time in my lifetime, we have a Presi-
dent who leads by talking about work-
ers, who leads by talking about unions. 
As a result of his leadership, we are 
seeing more job creation in Ohio. We 
have seen more jobs created in 2021 
than in any number of years in the 
past. We are seeing now tens of thou-
sands of manufacturing jobs—Intel, 
Hyperion, GE Aviation—coming to my 
State. It is all made possible because 
we are putting workers at the center of 
our economy. 
Look at the results we are getting. 
Last year—this is worth saying like 
five times—last year, for the first time 
in 20 years, our economy actually grew 
faster than China’s. Our GDP grew 
faster than China’s GDP. Again, that is 
because we have a President of the 
United States who puts workers at the 
center of our economic policy, who un-
derstands that carrying a union card 
means better wages, better benefits, 
and more control over your work 
schedule. 
But we know that China and our 
other competitors aren’t giving up. 
They are constantly finding new ways 
to cheat, new ways to undermine 
American jobs. That is why we need 
every tool possible to compete, includ-
ing a fully functioning Export-Import 
Bank with an experienced, tenacious 
leader at the helm. Jobs in Ohio and 
jobs around the country depend on Ms. 
Lewis’s success. 
I urge my colleagues—as we voted 
overwhelmingly on cloture—I urge my 
colleagues to support the nomination 
of Reta Jo Lewis for the Ex-Im Bank. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR NO. 650 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak in support of Mar-
tha Williams to be the Director of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
I represent a State that goes by 
many names. Most of you know it as 
Montana, but it is often called Big Sky 
Country, the Last Best Place, and even 
the 
Treasure 
State. 
Montana 
has 
earned these names through an abun-
dance of beauty and natural resources, 
and as a result we have fostered a ro-
bust outdoor economy that relies on 
responsible forest management. Folks 
come to Montana from all over the 
world to enjoy all that our State has to 
offer. Thousands of folks make their 
living by working the land and showing 
folks the best way to enjoy it. 
But the key to preserving our multi-
billion-dollar outdoor economy is prop-
er stewardship and oversight of our 
natural resources. That means talking 
to folks on the ground. It means bring-
ing competing interests to the table to 
find the most sustainable ways to man-
age our public lands. Not only do our 
forests and rivers create thousands of 
good-paying jobs, but they also create 
countless memories for families in our 
country. So it is critically important 
that we have balanced oversight in 
place to guarantee that Montana’s out-
door economy remains vibrant for gen-
erations to come. 
The Director of Fish and Wildlife 
Service plays a central role in this 
oversight, and that is why I am proud 
to support Martha Williams’ nomina-
tion today. As Director, she will be 
tasked with the management and re-
covery of our Nation’s fish and wildlife 
and overseeing a large chunk of our 
public lands—89 million acres, to be 
exact, from Montana’s own Red Rock 
Lakes National Wildlife Refuge all the 
way to the Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge. 
As a Montanan and a former Director 
of the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and 
Parks, Ms. Williams has demonstrated 
time and time again her ability to 
bring folks together to find lasting so-
lutions, to collaborate to find common 
ground. She always leads with science 
and has developed State management 
plans for issues ranging from grizzly 
bears to aquatic invasive mussels, and 
she has done it with input from all the 
relevant stakeholders. 
She also has a profound respect and 
understanding of the bedrock laws that 
guide responsible land and wildlife 
management. She will be bringing with 
her over a decade of legal experience 
with the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and 
Parks as well as a well-regarded legal 
scholar at the University of Montana. 
She has spent her entire career 
standing up for our public lands and 
proven herself to be a thoughtful, non-
partisan steward who works collabo-
ratively with folks on the ground to 
make positive change. Her top-notch 
ability to find common ground between 
sportsmen and conservationists alike 
and her skills as an exceptional prob-
lem-solver will make her an out-
standing Director at the Fish and Wild-
life Service. 
She has strong support from sports 
men and women, biologists, and aca-
demics alike and has already received 
strong bipartisan support from the 
Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee. She was passed out of com-
mittee on a 16-to-4 vote. 
Make no mistake about it, we will 
miss her leadership in the Treasure 
State, but I am looking forward to see-
ing her effective management skills at 
the Federal level. This position is very 
important for the stewardship of our 
land and our waters, and I would urge 
my colleagues to support her confirma-
tion today. 
And in that vein, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate consider the 
following nomination: Calendar No. 
650, Martha Williams, of Montana, to 
be Director of the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service; that the nomination be

S556 
February 8, 2022 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
reserving the right to object, I would 
like to talk a little bit about not just 
Ms. Williams—who as my friend from 
Montana has mentioned—I actually 
think she is qualified—but the issues 
that are in front of the Fish and Wild-
life Service, as we speak, that relate to 
my State, the great State of Alaska. 
Unfortunately, it has been one Exec-
utive order, Executive action, delay 
targeting Alaska—some from the Fish 
and Wildlife Service that has had an 
enormously negative impact on my 
State. 
I agree with the Senator from Mon-
tana. Fish and Wildlife Service is im-
portant. He mentioned that it manages 
89 million acres nationwide. Well, 77 
million acres of that 89 are in Alaska. 
Eight-five percent of Fish and Wildlife 
Service land that is managed is in one 
State, the great State of Alaska, a size 
bigger than the State of New Mexico, 
just for Fish and Wildlife Service land 
control. 
So this Agency, this nominee will 
have an enormous impact on my con-
stituents and, indeed, right now is hav-
ing an enormous impact on my con-
stituents, and I can’t get them to do 
anything constructive for the people I 
represent. 
Let me give you two, and perhaps my 
colleague from Montana can help me 
out with this. These are two directly— 
directly—in the jurisdiction of the Fish 
and Wildlife Service that we have been 
asking for support on and haven’t got-
ten it. One is the Russian River land 
exchange. This is a vital exchange that 
needs to happen for a highway project 
on Alaska’s Kenai Peninsula. 
Here is the thing about this land ex-
change. It has been in the works since 
1975—44 years, to be exact. We believe 
it is the longest running federally led 
environmental impact statement in the 
history of America, which is actually 
what happens a lot in the great State 
of Alaska. Groups come up; they don’t 
want any resource development; they 
don’t want any access to land and they 
sue and they stop and they try to delay 
things. This one has been delayed, in 
one form or another, for 44 years. 
Now, the previous administration, to 
its credit, heard the voices of Alaska, 
responded to the input from different 
stakeholders, and actually put forward 
a reasonable land exchange that was 
approved by the Federal Government. 
The regional office of the Fish and 
Wildlife Service sent the approved 
package to headquarters in Wash-
ington, DC, in November, where it 
sits—where it sits. 
So one thing I would like to do before 
this nominee moves forward is get a 
commitment to approve that. It is very 
simple—44 years. I don’t think we are 
asking too much, but it is delayed. 
Let me give you another one. Many 
of you have heard about the King Cove 
road. You are going to hear about it 
again because it is an issue that every 
Alaskan, even those who don’t live out 
on the Aleutian Island chain, are pas-
sionate about. Only in Alaska could 
this happen. It is an 11-mile, single- 
lane gravel road that will save lives for 
people in the community of King 
Cove—primarily 
Alaska 
Native—and 
they need approval of that through an-
other land exchange. We have been 
working on that for over 40 years—40 
years. People in my communities in 
that part of the State have died be-
cause there is no road to access an air-
port. There are a lot of storms in that 
part of the world, the Aleutian Islands. 
When they need access to get out on a 
plane, they often don’t have it because 
we can’t build a single lane, 11-mile 
gravel road. 
We have a land exchange approved by 
the previous administration. This ad-
ministration has said they are looking 
to approve it too. That is great news, 
but the Secretary of the Interior has 
said she is not going to fully endorse it 
until she goes out to King Cove and 
sees it herself. OK. We have been wait-
ing for that visit for a year—for a year. 
There is a theme here. With the new 
administration, if there is something 
that has been helpful to my State, pri-
marily by the previous administration, 
the Trump administration, on so many 
issues, bipartisan issues for Alaska, 
which has helped us in historic ways— 
on those helpful things, the new admin-
istration comes in, and they say: We 
are going to delay it. We are going to 
delay it. We have to relook at it. We 
don’t know. If the Trump administra-
tion did it for Alaska, it must have 
been bad. That is their thing. 
But on things that harm my State, 
this administration on day 1 has expe-
dited so many things. Day 1, the Presi-
dent is in office for 1 hour, and he 
issues an order dealing with ANWR, 
which this body approved in 2017. If it 
helps Alaska, they delay it. If it hurts 
Alaska, they are all over it. 
What we have in the first year of the 
Biden administration—first year—are 
21 Executive orders and Executive ac-
tions negatively impacting my State 
across the board on every topic you can 
imagine: access to lands, tourism, fish-
ing—21 Executive orders or actions. 
I gave a speech on this before the 
holidays, and it was 20—now it is 21— 
solely focused on Alaska. There is no 
other State in the country that is get-
ting this kind of attention from this 
administration. I am sure the great 
State of Montana isn’t. 
It is not just about resource develop-
ment. These actions are hurting the 
ability of my constituents to put food 
on the table, lights on in their homes, 
jobs, cultures. 
And one area that doesn’t nearly get 
enough attention, these actions, so 
many of them, are actually negatively 
impacting the Alaska Native commu-
nity of the great State of Alaska. The 
Native people of my State are targeted. 
Let me give you one example. The pre-
vious administration, working with 
this body in a bipartisan way, finally 
passed a bill that provided justice to 
Alaska Native Vietnam veterans who 
served their country during Vietnam. 
The Alaska Native community is one 
of the most patriotic communities in 
the country. They serve at higher rates 
in the military than any other ethnic 
group in the country. 
When many of them went to fight in 
Vietnam, they came home, and a law 
that had been on the books since 1906— 
the ability to get a Native allotment— 
had expired. They came home and said: 
Wait, I can’t get my native allotment? 
So we finally fixed that almost a half 
century later. Of course, a lot of rad-
ical enviros hated it because it is giv-
ing land in Alaska to people. 
The No. 1 issue I raised with Sec-
retary Holland during her confirmation 
process was to make sure the Execu-
tive order to get these lands to Viet-
nam veterans—Alaska Native Vietnam 
veterans—stays on track. The Trump 
administration did all they could to 
make it happen. All they had to do was 
hit ‘‘send.’’ She delayed it for 2 years— 
delayed it for 2 years. She wasn’t even 
going to tell the delegation. I guar-
antee you, in the next 2 years, as this 
is being delayed, a lot of these Vietnam 
vets—Alaska Vietnam vets—will die 
before they even get their lands. So we 
are starting to hear it. 
I want to make one final point. This 
is very important. This administration 
talks a lot about racial justice, envi-
ronmental equity. They talk about it 
all the time, but it comes with a ca-
veat. They say they want to help dis-
advantaged 
communities, 
minority 
communities. I think that is a good 
goal, but it comes with a caveat—ra-
cial justice, environmental equity, un-
less it is for the indigenous people of 
Alaska, and then they get targeted. 
A lot of these Executive orders are 
targeting them. I have a whole list 
where some of the most disadvantaged 
Americans in the country are being 
targeted—in my view, because of their 
race—by this administration. 
I have submitted these before, but I 
am going to submit them again for the 
RECORD, several letters from Alaska 
Native groups talking about this un-
warranted lack of consultation and tar-
geting of their interests in my State. 
I ask unanimous consent to have one 
of these letters printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S557 
February 8, 2022 
of Alaska. I am writing today to provide 
comments on Executive Order 13985 calling 
on federal agencies to advance equity by 
identifying and addressing barriers to equal 
opportunity that underserved communities 
face due to government policies and pro-
grams. 
The North Slope region is one of the most 
remote areas in the United States and all 
eight communities in our region are consid-
ered ‘‘underserved.’’ We see many barriers 
and challenges when addressing equity in 
government policies and action. The focus 
areas identified in EO 13985 around con-
tracting, recreating on public lands and trib-
al discretionary grants are part of a larger 
problem when addressing the issue for native 
communities that we see, in addition to re-
cent decisions by this administration around 
resource development and the economy our 
region relies on. 
As an organization built on inclusiveness, 
we emphasize the importance of addressing 
equity in several ways: most importantly, 
with continued dialogue because we still see 
and feel the effects of a federal government 
that treated our people as a burden and an 
impedance. Several of our communities are 
still dealing with the cleanup of toxic mate-
rials leftover from military occupation and 
the development of Distance Early Warn-
ing—‘‘DEW line’’—sites during the Cold War. 
One of our communities, Kaktovik, was 
forced to relocate three times in recent his-
tory and their homes and gravesites were 
bulldozed to flatten out a runway for Air 
Force activity without restitution or even 
an apology. Trust in our federal government 
is still being built, and the basis of that rela-
tionship is meaningful consultation, collabo-
ration and only then can greater equity be 
seen for underserved communities like ours. 
In terms of equity, we understand that the 
Biden Administration has made promises do-
mestically and internationally to curb this 
country’s emissions and we, as In˜ upiat peo-
ple whose homelands are on the front lines of 
climate change, can understand the need to 
move in that direction when it comes to ad-
dress government policies. What we cannot 
support, however, is that those efforts are 
made on the backs of indigenous peoples 
without even a conversation, that is not how 
more equity is achieved. The federal govern-
ment must allow us the time and resources 
for a thoughtful, deliberate, and sustainable 
transition of our economy but instead we 
have seen secretarial and executive actions 
that threaten our way of economic sustain-
ability and therefore our way of life. 
Our most pressing concern is the imminent 
threat to the North Slope Borough economy 
that started on day one of this administra-
tion, with little warning nor communication 
through reversing Records of Decision, halt-
ing new projects, and a reductionist climate 
agenda that singles out and vilifies the oil 
and gas industry as an alternative to cre-
ating a realistic, multi-dimensional climate 
strategy. The State of Alaska has some of 
this highest and most rigorous environ-
mental protection policies in the country 
with respect to oil and gas development. Our 
regional government, the North Slope Bor-
ough (NSB) is a home-rule government re-
sponsible for more territory than any other 
local government in the nation, an area 
roughly the same size as the state of Indi-
ana. The NSB receives 96% of their revenue 
from property taxes that are levied on oil 
and gas industry infrastructure on the North 
Slope, which enables them to provide serv-
ices that were historically inaccessible in 
the Arctic. The Borough School District pro-
vides vocational and academic education for 
people of all ages; NSB health clinics provide 
modern medicinal services to residents in 
even the smallest and remote of villages. 
The Municipal Services Department operates 
water, sewer, and electric utilities, plows 
roads and runways, and maintains landfills. 
The Planning Department provides a third 
level of oversight to the oil industry within 
our region on top of State and federal over-
sight and regulations. Other NSB depart-
ments provide housing, police and fire pro-
tection, search and rescue, and other critical 
services to our communities. They do this 
independently, without assistance from state 
nor federal government. The benefits of mod-
ern American civilization, common in the 
rest of the nation, have been built on the 
foundation of the North Slope oil industry. 
In terms of equity for our region and as 
economies transition, the U.S. government 
must work to create as much stability as 
possible and make every effort to not leave 
our residents to deal with the volatility and 
instability that will likely result from policy 
changes 
made 
in 
the 
name 
of 
decarbonization. Fossil fuel usage will no 
doubt decrease over time as renewable re-
sources become more widely available and 
affordable. 
However, 
renewable 
resource 
technology has not developed to a place 
where it can be widely applicable in our re-
gion; charging an electric car is not easy in 
villages that experience blackouts or still 
rely on diesel generators for power. Instead 
of trying to score short term political cap-
ital by drastically changing oil and gas ex-
traction and ignoring local perspectives, a 
long-term realistic outlook and working 
with the people in the places that currently 
rely on these resources is not only the right 
thing to do, but an obligation of the govern-
ment under its trust responsibility with its 
indigenous peoples. Without that coopera-
tion and relationship, equity will be impos-
sible to achieve as indigenous and local 
voices will ignored. 
CONTRACTS FOR BUSINESSES WITH CHARACTER-
ISTICS THAT ALIGN WITH THE DEFINITION OF 
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY 
Impacts on equity seen through the con-
tracts and businesses awarded by federal 
agencies are visible in many ways. Our re-
gion has had little investment or resources 
put in place to develop businesses that can 
help build capacity to provide the ability to 
search for, apply and win government con-
tracts. If a local business has an economic 
development arm, most are not comparable 
to outside larger firms who have an advan-
tage and can adjust their business models 
easily to bid and be awarded government 
contracts. The businesses that do get con-
tracts typically do not align with local tradi-
tions and practices or rarely have the poten-
tial to bring tangible economic return to the 
community beyond short-term labor posi-
tions. When and if activity does occur, some 
larger businesses fail engage with local 
tribes, and sometimes even the awarding 
agency fails to communicate with residents 
on what project or business opportunities are 
upcoming in their own community. The De-
partment of the Interior (‘‘Department’’) can 
use power of procurement to contract with 
and support businesses that align and re-
spect native communities, particularly small 
and disadvantaged businesses that align with 
local traditions. 
We recommend that the Department find 
more creative ways to distribute information 
via social media and local media in addition 
to helping facilitate matching programs for 
small businesses to become teaming part-
ners. The Department can also do better by 
communicating opportunities that are avail-
able to tribal businesses by facilitating addi-
tional networking through conferences, fo-
rums or meet and greets. Another way would 
be for the Department to implement addi-
tional policies requiring large businesses to 
work with smaller businesses on contracting 
opportunities, like the small businesses act-
ing as a sub-contractor to a prime con-
tractor, 
allowing 
for 
partnership 
and 
mentorship between the companies of dif-
ferent sizes. Regional non-profits can help fa-
cilitate this partnership and have capacity 
that smaller tribes and communities may 
not. 
Another way to improve the process and 
relationships 
around 
federal 
contracting 
would be to help provide clearer communica-
tion channels for businesses to access the 
Department’s point of contacts. As most 
interactions with the federal government, it 
is difficult finding answers to questions in a 
timely manner, creating additional issues 
for smaller and tribal businesses who are 
trying to navigate the application process. 
We also see barriers surrounding the appli-
cation processes themselves. No two agencies 
have the same procurement or application 
requirements. This builds additional stum-
bling blocks into the system and requires 
local businesses, often an incredibly small 
team of people, to do significant additional 
work. Streamlining federal grants and con-
tracts to have similar requirements would 
greatly improve equity and the ability of 
small indigenous companies or entities to be 
successful through these processes. 
RECREATION ACCESS TO DOI-MANAGED LANDS 
FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES 
The In˜ upiat people and the residents who 
call the Arctic home have a unique relation-
ship with the lands and water. Historically 
our people regularly roamed hundreds of 
miles in search of game and hunted up and 
down our coastlines to survive. But many of 
our communities continue to have a strained 
relationship with the federal government 
and agencies with the Department because of 
historical slights and being denied access to 
lands that were historically used. On top of 
that, additional burdensome Departmental 
and agency regulations and policies have 
created additional barriers when trying to 
access and recreate on across our homelands 
that are now public lands which surround 
many of our communities. Two communities 
in our region, Anaktuvuk Pass which lies in-
side the Gates of the Arctic National Park 
and Kaktovik which lies within the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge are impacted by 
Department agencies that have not imple-
mented their rights under the 1980 Alaska 
National Interest Lands Conservation Act 
(‘‘ANILCA’’). There are several provisions 
under ANILCA that have either not been im-
plemented or have been partially imple-
mented that restricts these communities ac-
cess to their subsistence resources through 
restrictions. Section 1110(b) was intended to 
protect the traditional overland travel for 
these communities to allow for summer ac-
cess however the appropriate documentation 
of traditional access has not been completed 
for Kaktovik over 40 years after the passage 
of ANCSA. The regulation of motorized vehi-
cles on public land makes it harder for na-
tive communities to access their own lands, 
let alone public lands in the federal land sys-
tem. The agencies have not worked with ei-
ther community in implementation of Sec-
tion 1307 with respect to tourism in either 
the park or the refuge. This is the opposite 
of the question, in that the Department 
agencies are issuing permits over the home-
lands of our people yet not providing either 
Anaktuvuk Pass or Kaktovik the ability to 
control tourism to their economic benefit by 
not following Section 1307. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Climate change appears in many different 
forms across Alaska. It is well known that 
the Arctic is ‘‘ground zero’’ for climate 
change; on Alaska’s North Slope, increased

February 8, 2022 
ice-free seasons have resuIted in greater 
coastal erosion and difficulty accessing some 
of our subsistence resources; melting perma-
frost has exacerbated this erosion in addition 
to creating infrastructure damage that is ex-
pensive to repair, ruining our traditional 
sig˙ uaqs (ice cellars where meat is stored) 
through flooding, and is making travel 
across tundra more difficult. Elsewhere in 
Alaska, other regions are also struggling 
with an increase in wildfires, the warming of 
rivers that leads to stresses in the fish popu-
lations that they rely on to subsist, flooding, 
and the introduction and expansion of 
invasive plants and insects. Any response 
mechanisms that the government introduces 
must be flexible and robust enough to cover 
the varying changes that we are seeing 
across our region and the State as a whole. 
VOICE’s overarching recommendation is 
that the Department consider—in lieu of new 
‘‘top down’’ policies that, while well inten-
tioned, don’t always serve communities as 
they are intended—setting up a grant pro-
gram that allows affected communities the 
flexibility and empowerment to respond to 
the impacts that they are facing in a cul-
turally responsible way that fits their local 
environment and community. Overall, we 
have not seen very many examples of govern-
ment responses and assistance to our climate 
related changes that have been particularly 
useful. Any action related to a changing cli-
mate falls to the NSB, to handle the re-
sponses in our communities, including build-
ing sea walls to protect against erosion and 
fixing roads and buildings damaged by per-
mafrost thaw. Through a multi-year effort, 
the NSB has been working through the proc-
ess of receiving funding and support from the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build revet-
ment in the community of Utqiag˙vik, our 
largest community, to prevent erosion from 
consuming many houses, businesses, and 
local infrastructure. Utqiag˙vik is not the 
only community in our region that is experi-
encing significant erosion; there are similar 
needs in Point Hope and Wainwright. Pro-
grams and policies that would assist in as-
sessment of climate related changes and ad-
dress solutions and funding around these im-
pacts are necessary. 
In terms of climate change observation and 
other related programs, we have seen most 
success in local observer networks, when 
local people are trained to monitor and 
measure the changes that they are seeing in 
their own communities, this creates a sense 
of empowerment rather than helplessness. 
Ideally, permanent, local jobs within our 
communities threatened by climate change 
would be created by an initiative from the 
federal government. We believe that support 
of these local networks should be prioritized 
over the many studies in our communities 
that are conducted by multiple federal agen-
cies. Current local network systems need to 
be expanded to include all communities be-
cause they rely heavily on indigenous and 
traditional knowledge of our environment in 
a way that no western scientist can compare. 
VOICE recommends that there are clear defi-
nitions developed around climate change ter-
minology, for example, ‘climate change resil-
ience’ is ambiguous and is geographically 
variable. The truth is that in the Arctic, and 
in Alaska in general, we are well beyond the 
point of mitigation and have firmly moved 
into the realm of adaptation. From retro-
fitting existing infrastructure to moving en-
tire communities, adaptation is incredibly 
expensive. Federal agencies should take a 
stronger initiative in partnering with our 
local communities to better understand the 
impacts of climate change and the viability 
of available renewable technologies that can 
be utilized in arctic conditions. All of our 
communities currently run off of hydro-
carbons and we hear from those unfamiliar 
with our ecosystem that we should begin the 
switch to run our communities off of renew-
able resources, but we have yet to see a le-
gitimate solution to our energy needs that is 
viable in the unique and challenging Arctic 
conditions. 
APPLYING FOR AND ACCESSING TRIBAL 
DISCRETIONARY GRANTS 
One way the process around discretionary 
grants for tribes that can be improved would 
be to set up additional offices and positions 
in regional offices like Tribal grant liaisons 
to assist tribes and help build a sustainable 
beneficial relationship. A regional grant liai-
son dedicated to tribes would also be able to 
help the department create more targeted 
communication grant campaigns and they 
could act as a point of contact for tribes 
navigating the grants process. Small tribes 
like those in our region often have a difficult 
time building relationships with the federal 
government and understanding the federal 
regulations around the grants they are ap-
plying for. As I mentioned the burdensome 
reporting process can create challenges with 
tribes that have low capacity or high turn-
over, leaving them ineligible for future 
grants. Federal agencies should take a 
stronger initiative in partnering with our 
local communities to better understand 
them before developing and awarding grants. 
Thank you for the opportunity to com-
ment on addressing equity in government 
policies. We hope that this conversation will 
be ongoing and that our comments will be 
useful as the United States Government de-
cides how best to address this issue. 
Quyanaq, 
JOHN HOPSON, JR., 
President. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Here is one. It is 
from the president of the Voice of the 
Arctic In˜ upiat, John Hopson, Jr. 
In terms of equity [racial equity] we under-
stand that the Biden Administration has 
made 
promises 
domestically 
and 
inter-
nationally to curb this country’s emissions 
and we, as In˜ upiat people whose homelands 
are on the front lines of climate change, can 
understand the need to move in that direc-
tion when it comes to address government 
policies. What we cannot support, however, 
is that those efforts are [often] made on the 
backs of indigenous peoples in Alaska with-
out even a conversation, that is not how 
more equity is achieved. The federal govern-
ment must allow us time and resources for a 
thoughtful, deliberate, and sustainable tran-
sition of our economy but instead we have 
seen secretarial and executive actions [from 
this administration] that threaten our way 
of [life and] economic sustainability and 
therefore our [entire] way of life [in Amer-
ica’s Arctic]. 
Another group: Apparently, consulta-
tion with all indigenous groups in the 
country, except for those in Alaska, is 
this administration’s policy. 
So, bottom line, I need commitments 
from the Fish and Wildlife Service on 
these issues: the Russian River land ex-
change, the King Cove land exchange. 
More broadly, I need the administra-
tion to end its war on Alaska and our 
working families. 
I am happy to discuss with the Sen-
ator from Montana on these issues and 
maybe get his help, but for right now, 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. 
TESTER. 
Madam 
President, 
could I just get a minute? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TESTER. Because I know there 
is a vote coming. 
First of all, I would ask my friend 
from Alaska—I appreciate the fact you 
are standing up for your constituents 
to do what is right. I have no problem 
with that whatsoever. I have no prob-
lem with the concerns you brought up 
on the Russian River and the King 
Cove Road, although I don’t know the 
issues nearly as well as you do. But my 
point is this: If you are able to put Ms. 
WILLIAMS in as Director of the Fish and 
Wildlife Service, she has a track record 
of listening to people. You happen to 
have a ‘‘U.S. Senator’’ in front of your 
name; you will be at the top of the list. 
She is not somebody who shuts the 
door and says: Just because you are Re-
publican, I don’t want to listen to you. 
She is somebody who always brings in 
people, collaborates, and comes to a de-
cision that will work. I wouldn’t be up 
here advocating for her if I didn’t be-
lieve that. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Well, to my col-
league, I look forward to working with 
you on that and those amendments and 
look forward to moving her nomination 
forward in that light. 
I yield the floor.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, last week, 
I came to the floor to warn that we are 
moving closer to a yearlong continuing 
resolution, or a CR, that would have 
devastating implications for every Fed-
eral Agency—particularly the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
We are 5 months into the fiscal year. 
Soon, the House will send over another 
stop-gap measure so we can avoid a 
shutdown for a few more weeks. When 
the short-term funding bill expires, the 
fiscal year will be halfway over. We 
need to get this work done. 
As outlined last week, Democrats put 
a deal on the table months ago that 
gave Republicans what they wanted— 
more funding for defense than the $22 
billion increase that President Biden 
sought and less money for nondefense 
programs 
than 
he 
requested. 
This 
should have been an easy deal for them 
to accept. Indeed, the defense funding 
number that Democrats are willing to 
agree to is the number that Repub-
licans on the Armed Services Com-
mittee proposed this summer and that 
was incorporated into the National De-
fense Authorization Act. But even with 
that defense number in hand, our Re-
publican colleagues continue to draw 
out negotiations, pushing us closer to a 
full-year continuing resolution that 
would fund defense at a level that is 
less than President Biden initially re-
quested and about $37 billion lower 
than the level set out in the NDAA. 
I think that is important. If the Re-
publicans continue to reject a sensible 
agreement on an Omnibus appropria-
tions bill, they will end up with a de-
fense number that is less than what 
President Biden sent up, and what he 
sent up was harshly and vigorously 
criticized by the Republicans as being 
not only ineffectual but also somehow 
undermining our defense. 
So it is very clear that we have to 
move quickly to make a full-year CR 
an impossibility and that we have to 
move and vote for an Omnibus appro-
priations bill. A CR for the full year 
will shortchange our military. It will 
disrupt the efficient operations of the 
Federal Government in the midst of 
international 
tension, 
the 
ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic, and a fragile eco-
nomic recovery. 
Let me focus on the Navy and Marine 
Corps for a moment. Like the other 
services, they would be hard hit. A full- 
year CR would lead to a shortfall of 
$4.4 billion from the level the President 
requested. 
Even worse, the Navy estimates the 
impact could total more than $14 bil-
lion of misaligned funds because a CR 
prohibits any new starts and produc-
tion rate increases. The military per-
sonnel accounts alone would be $1.6 bil-
lion below what the Navy needs, and 
that is the pay and benefits for our 
men and women in uniform. The 
Navy’s Active-Duty end strength would 
be reduced by 23,000 sailors of its 
planned accessions. Almost half of the 
permanent 
change-of-station 
moves 
would be cut, and the Navy Reserves 
would also face a substantial reduction 
in its end strength. 
A full-year CR could leave the train-
ing and readiness accounts for the 
Navy and Marine Corps about $2.5 bil-
lion short of what they need. This 
shortfall would reduce the services’ 
flight operations by 10 to 20 percent for 
all units for 6 months. Reductions in 
ship operations will put training cer-
tifications for one carrier strike group 
and two expeditionary strike groups at 
risk, thereby impacting fiscal year 2023 
deployments. 
This shortfall would impact the 
scheduling of ship maintenance avail-
abilities for five Virginia-class sub-
marines and two aircraft carriers—

something that will ripple through the 
industrial base in future fiscal years. 
For the Marines, maintenance avail-
abilities for 12 of their landing craft 
would be deferred, including 6 landing 
craft air cushions and 6 landing craft 
utility. These deferrals would poten-
tially impact their ability to support 
operational needs around the globe. If 
we don’t keep our ships and amphib-
ious vehicles maintained, they will not 
be ready nor reliable when they are 
needed in operations, thereby risking 
the safety of our servicemembers and 
impeding their ability to perform the 
mission. 
These are just some of the oper-
ational impacts the Navy and Marine 
Corps would face under a yearlong CR. 
A CR will also prevent the Navy from 
effectively 
modernizing 
and 
rein-
vesting in new programs. The Depart-
ment of the Navy would not be able to 
execute 10 new procurement programs 
and 10 new research and development 
projects. 
Additionally, 20 programs would not 
be able to increase their production 
rate as planned in the budget request. 
Perhaps most importantly, the CR 
would provide insufficient funding for 
the continued construction of SSBN– 
826, the first boat of the Columbia-class 
ballistic missile submarine program, 
which is replacing the aging Ohio-class 
submarines. 
The Columbia-class program is vitally 
important to maintaining our strategic 
nuclear deterrence. I have seen the 
boat currently under construction in 
Rhode Island, the state-of-the-art hull 
cylinders and missile tubes. It is a for-
midable vessel, and it needs to stay on 
track. 
A yearlong CR would also affect the 
advance procurement funding for the 
second, third, fourth, and fifth of the 
submarines of this class. Effectively, 
we would be disrupting the unavoidable 
replacing 
of 
aging 
Ohio-class 
sub-
marines with the new Columbia class. 
All this would mean down the road 
eventually is just more expensive sub-
marines. 
We are already on a tight schedule to 
deliver SSBN–826 to meet the require-
ments of Strategic Command. Chief of 
Naval Operations Admiral Gilday has 
said that the Columbia class is the 
Navy’s ‘‘number one modernization pri-
ority’’ and that it ‘‘is a program with 
zero margin for delays.’’ 
The impacts aren’t limited to our un-
dersea fleet. Under a yearlong CR, the 
Navy also wouldn’t be able to purchase 
three additional surface ships—two of 
the TAGOS ocean surveillance ships 
and one ship to shore connector—and 
the Navy won’t be able to start pro-
curing materials in advance for the 
new frigate and the TAO fleet oiler. 
The Marines will not be able to buy 7 
more F35 Joint Strike Fighters, 20 
more of the amphibious combat vehi-
cle, nor additional quantities of the 
joint air-to-ground missile and Hellfire 
missiles. Instead of procuring six MQ– 
9A Reaper UAVS, the Marines will get 
zero. 
There are many impacts to new re-
search and development projects that 
cannot be started under a CR, and the 
Navy is very concerned about the 
shortfall in funding for the Conven-
tional Prompt Strike Program. This 
missile, which is being jointly devel-
oped and produced with the Army, will 
provide Navy ships and Virginia-class 
submarines with a hypersonic weapon 
capability that is critical to our Na-
tion’s ability to deter conflict with 
China and with Russia. In order to 
make up this shortfall under a CR and 
keep this program on pace, the Navy 
would have to divert funding from 
other important R&D programs. It is 
one step forward and two steps back 
and in some cases may cause delays 
that are unrecoverable. 
The Navy and Marine Corps also 
won’t be able to start 17 military con-
struction projects—new facilities that 
our sailors and marines need to do 
their jobs safely and effectively. This 
includes, among others, $321 million for 
two projects in North Carolina, $288 
million for three projects in Virginia, 
$14 million for a project in Minnesota, 
$49 million for a project in Michigan, 
$558 million for eight projects in Guam, 
and $50 million for a project in Japan. 
This will clearly affect our ability to 
have a forward-operating presence in 
the Indo-Pacific region and to confront 
what the Secretary of Defense has 
called the pacing threat—China. 
These are just some examples of the 
varied impacts and challenges the 
Navy and Marine Corps would face if 
there was a yearlong CR. I would en-
courage my colleagues to read the full 
testimony of the Chief of Naval Oper-
ations, Admiral Gilday, and the Com-
mandant of the Marine Corps, General 
Berger, which they submitted to the 
House Appropriations Subcommittee 
on Defense. 
These statements can be found online 
on the House Committee on Appropria-
tions 
website 
at 
https://appropria-
tions.house.gov/events/hearings/im-
pact-of-continuing-resolutions-on-the- 
department-of-defense-and-services. 
In short, a yearlong CR will make us 
less competitive with our adversaries 
and less able to respond to the rapidly 
changing global landscape, and these 
are some things—these efforts are not 
something the Defense Department can 
do on its own. We need to fund our dip-
lomats and our law enforcement and 
all Agencies of the Federal Govern-
ment. 
Indeed, we cannot afford to short-
change nondefense priorities. A CR will 
not adequately fund our Defense De-
partment nor our domestic Agencies. 
Stating the obvious, we are still in the 
midst of the COVID–19 pandemic. Are 
we truly willing to fund the NIH and 
the CDC and other public health Agen-
cies at last year’s levels? Are we will-
ing to tell school systems to make do 
with the same funding levels for crit-
ical programs like title I? Are we going 
to cut funding for housing rental as-
sistance? Are we willing to short-
change law enforcement, including the 
Capitol Police? 
We need to get our work done. That 
begins with reaching an agreement 
that provides the funding Americans 
need on both sides of the ledger. A full- 
year CR is not an acceptable solution. 
I am hopeful that agreement is near. 
But no one should believe those who 
claim to support our national defense 
while threatening a yearlong CR, and 
no one should claim that our domestic 
needs are somehow unworthy of sup-
port as well. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

2022 WINTER OLYMPICS 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, it goes 
without saying that each of the Amer-
ican athletes competing in the Olym-
pics this year is the best in their event. 
Many of them have dedicated their en-
tire lives to their sports in the hope 
that they might have this opportunity 
to represent the United States at the 
Olympic Games. They have earned 
their spots on Team USA, and I wish 
them the best as they compete against 
other athletes from around the world. 
But make no mistake, Beijing 2022 is 
no ordinary Olympics. Just a 4-hour 
flight from where the Games are being 
held, China has imprisoned more than 
a million Uighur Muslims in con-
centration camps. These Chinese citi-
zens 
are 
prisoners—political 
pris-
oners—in their own country. Their 
crime? Maintaining a vibrant Muslim 
culture that doesn’t fit the mold that 
Beijing wants to impose on China’s 
more than 1.4 billion people. The very 
same government that is hosting the 
Olympics this week is putting these in-
nocent people in labor camps and sub-
jecting them to forced sterilization, 
forced labor, and physical and psycho-
logical torture. 
One of the few things that President 
Trump and President Biden agree on is 
that what China is doing to its Uighur 
population amounts to genocide. 
Last November, one of the most fa-
mous athletes in China, Peng Shuai, 
posted on social media that a high- 
ranking politician in the Chinese Com-
munist Party had sexually assaulted 
her. This wasn’t just any politician; he 
was a member of the Politburo Stand-
ing Committee and the face of China’s 
successful effort to land the 2022 Olym-
pics. He even met with the president of 
the International Olympic Committee 
at least once. 
Speaking out about someone like 
this is dangerous in a country like 
China. Peng Shuai knew that, but I 
don’t think she expected what came 
next. Less than 20 minutes after she

posted her accusation, her existence 
had been scrubbed from the internet. 
Any mention of her name was re-
stricted. For a while, the Communist 
Party banned discussion of hundreds of 
other key words, even words as general 
as ‘‘tennis.’’ She disappeared from the 
public eye for months, and the only ap-
pearances that she has been allowed to 
make since have been scripted and su-
pervised by the CCP. 
If this is how China treats its own 
people, I think it is fair to ask: What 
kind of risks are our athletes facing as 
they 
participate 
in 
the 
Olympic 
Games? 
To protest China’s miserable human 
rights record, the United States insti-
tuted a diplomatic boycott, and Amer-
ican officials will not be present for 
these Games; neither will officials rep-
resenting many of our allies, like Can-
ada or the United Kingdom. That is the 
right decision. We shouldn’t pretend 
that everything is fine in China just 
because the IOC chose them to host the 
Olympics. 
As far as the committee is concerned, 
they have made it very clear that Chi-
na’s money is worth more to them than 
the rights of the world’s athletes. They 
had years to plan for these Olympics, 
but they still chose not to adopt any 
rules to protect the human rights of 
Olympians while they are in China. In-
stead, competitors are required to fol-
low local laws limiting free expression, 
privacy, and other basic freedoms. 
Before they ever set foot in China, 
athletes and journalists were required 
to download an intrusive smartphone 
app, supposedly to track COVID–19 in-
fections. Experts say that China and 
other malicious actors could exploit 
flaws in the app’s design to go beyond 
that and spy on athletes in many other 
ways, both during the Olympics and 
long after they are over. 
The CCP’s app also contains a list of 
more than 400 illegal words that they 
could use to censor athletes’ conversa-
tions. 
The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic 
Committee has gone as far as to tell 
American athletes to ‘‘assume that 
every device and every communication, 
transaction, and online activity will be 
monitored.’’ Many other nations have 
issued similar warnings. 
This all could have been avoided. We 
didn’t have to host a unifying event 
like the Olympics in a country that 
thinks the book ‘‘1984’’ is an instruc-
tion manual. The IOC chose to have 
China host the Olympics anyway. They 
chose to ignore these and many other 
shameless human rights abuses Beijing 
engages in every single day. They could 
have required China to respect the 
basic liberties athletes enjoy in the 
United States and other Western coun-
tries, but they didn’t. The next time a 
host country is chosen, it is important 
that the IOC pick any of the dozens of 
democracies around the world. 
The more than 200 athletes on Team 
USA earned their places at the Olym-
pics with years of hard work and sac-
rifice. I do wish them the best, and I 
pray that they stay safe while they are 
away from home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, in an ef-
fort to make the internet healthy, 
happy, and peaceful, the Chinese Gov-
ernment recently clamped down on 
what it deems as online bad behavior. 
Beijing knows all about bad behavior. 
In fact, if behaving badly were an 
Olympic sport, China would take the 
gold, silver, and bronze. 
Speaking of the Olympics, last week 
the Olympic cauldron was lit in the 
Chinese capital by a Uighur torch-
bearer. It was a spectacular opening 
ceremony, with thousands of partici-
pants filling the Bird’s Nest. Its cho-
reography was innovative, its artistry 
unprecedented as China sought to por-
tray itself to the world not as it is but 
as they want to be seen. 
There was an LED floor below, bril-
liant 
fireworks 
overhead. 
Children 
danced, sang, and raised glowing doves. 
The theme was socially conscious and 
environmentally aware. 
The Chinese flag was passed through 
the hands of people representing the di-
versity within China, and it was raised 
where it billowed proudly, even though 
there wasn’t a breeze. 
And not a single American Govern-
ment official was present—not a single 
government official. You see, we sent 
our regrets to the Chinese Communist 
Party, refused to join in the Xi Jinping 
games. We let a few of the reasons why 
we didn’t appear be submitted candidly 
to the world. 
A million Uighurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz 
are locked away in gulags—raped, tor-
tured with electric batons, sterilized, 
forced into abortions—all in an effort 
to eradicate these religious and ethnic 
minorities not just from Xinjiang but 
from the face of the Earth. 
Taiwan’s sovereignty is continually 
threatened with the Chinese flying air-
craft, streaking across Taiwan’s skies. 
Hong Kong’s democracy is strangled. 
There and across the CCP’s domain, 
dissidents, whistleblowers, and pro-
testers are apprehended, imprisoned, 
persecuted, 
and 
reeducated—free 
speech 
and 
expression 
stifled 
and 
censored, religious freedom denied. 
A virus was recklessly unleashed on 
the world, upturning our lives, killing 
our most vulnerable, closing our busi-
nesses, damaging our economy, and di-
viding our people. 
A nation is hosting a storied athletic 
competition, but that nation erases its 
own athletes for telling embarrassing 
truths about its government. 
The history, distant and recent, of 
the communist Chinese Government is 
one of inhumanity, ruthless violation 
of the most basic human rights, and 
aggression toward America and its al-
lies. 
The Olympic Games in Beijing, spit 
and polished, even carbon-neutral, may 
present the face of a humane and car-
ing world power, but we are not fooled. 
We see through the charade—a slave 
state hosting the Olympics; its partici-
pants 
wearing 
uniforms 
made 
by 
Uighurs tortured and toiling in labor 
camps. 
We see the authoritarian regime be-
hind what the dissident artist Ai 
Weiwei calls China’s fake smile. And 
we are leading by example. The CCP 
has the world stage, but we are not in 
the audience. 
Our athletes are in Beijing, though. 
They are on the ice, in the snow, on the 
slopes, and in the arena, and they 
should be. They have worked their en-
tire lives for this moment. They are 
seizing it, while we root them on. And 
I want America’s Olympians to bring 
back every single gold medal. 
But I also want our athletes to know 
what the Chinese Government might 
have in store for them. So here are a 
few hopefully helpful words for our 
American Olympians. 
Keep an eye on your bank account. 
That is right. When you buy a meal or 
a souvenir in Beijing, you will be 
forced to pay for it with the CCP’s dig-
ital yuan. The Chinese Government 
claims the system creates more effi-
cient payments across its economy, but 
it is also a way of keeping tabs on your 
transactions and watching what you 
buy. Be aware. Think twice about what 
you buy in Beijing. You see, the Inter-
national Olympic Committee made no 
effort to stop the sale of apparel made 
with forced labor. 
Not only will China’s Olympic team 
be wearing uniforms likely produced by 
slave labor, but official Olympic gar-
ments could be coming from the same 
oppressed source. 
And don’t be fooled by uncensoring. 
The CCP erases any unflattering but 
accurate portrayals of itself on the 
internet. With the world watching, it is 
now promising to lower the great fire-
wall, allowing athletes and the press 
open access to the internet through 
SIM cards. China’s own citizens are af-
forded no such privilege. Hopefully, 
you brought a burner phone and left 
your personal devices at home. 
Keep an eye out for your fellow ath-
letes. Now, this is important. Tennis 
star Peng Shuai disappeared in Novem-
ber after accusing a Chinese official of 
sexual assault. Her peers and the Wom-
en’s Tennis Association called for ac-
tion—an extraordinary showing of soli-
darity. But after Peng was seen in a 
video, the world moved on, much to 
China’s delight. 
We may never know how many Chi-
nese athletes live under fear from their 
oppressive government. 
Journalists, by the way, you should 
be on guard too. You see, there is no 
freedom of the press in China. Report-
ers are regularly harassed, censored, 
and surveilled. In fact, in 2021, China 
jailed 50 journalists—more than any 
other nation. 
During the 2008 Summer Games in 
Beijing, there were at least 30 cases of 
CCP officials interfering with reporting 
and assaulting journalists. And that

February 8, 2022 
was when China was truly concerned 
about making a positive impression 
across the world. 
Lastly, and most importantly, to all 
America’s athletes, don’t forget this: 
Your country is behind you. By boy-
cotting the Olympics, our government 
is shining a light on the CCP’s abuse of 
its citizens and its disregard for the 
rest of the world, but by competing in 
the Olympics, our athletes are showing 
what a free people from an open society 
are capable of. Now, remember, the 
Olympics have long been a forum for 
American victory at the expense of au-
thoritarians’ pride. They were an early 
front in the war against fascism. 
Jesse Owens won four gold medals in 
the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, while Hit-
ler looked on, humiliated, his delusion 
of 
Aryan 
superiority 
burst. 
When 
Owens stood on the podium after win-
ning the long jump, he was surrounded 
by Sieg Heils, but he stood taller and 
he stood higher than all of them, salut-
ing Old Glory. 
But it was Cornelius ‘‘Corny’’ John-
son who was the first Black American 
to earn gold in Berlin, winning the 
high jump. The silver went to Dave 
Albritton, another American, who was 
also Black. Delos Thurbur, yet another 
American, won the bronze. Hitler re-
fused to meet with them or to con-
gratulate any of them. 
When they took the podium, all three 
offered their own protest to the dic-
tator—the Bellamy salute; the palm- 
out salute of the American flag named 
for Francis Bellamy, the author of the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
The Olympics were a battleground in 
the Cold War as well. 
In 1980, the unheralded and ragtag 
American hockey team upset the four- 
time gold medal-winning Soviets. Two 
days later, they defeated Finland and 
won the gold. 
Russia had just invaded Afghanistan. 
America’s economy was in recession. 
The victory not only shocked the 
world, it lifted our Nation and sunk the 
Soviet’s spirits. The Russian hockey 
players didn’t even bother to have 
their silver medals engraved; they were 
so angry about losing to America. 
Now, in 2022, another act in a global 
power competition will take place at 
the Olympics. We have seen it unfold in 
recent days. America and the free West 
against the communist Chinese Gov-
ernment. It is part of the contest that 
will define this century—show the CCP 
that the future belongs to the free; 
that authoritarian governments always 
fail the people trapped under them. 
Win. Make Xi Jinping and the Chi-
nese authorities hear the ‘‘Star-Span-
gled Banner’’ and see the Stars and 
Stripes again and again and again. 
We are cheering you on and will be 
waiting for you when you come home 
decorated in gold. Good luck to Team 
USA, and God bless America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, we 
have a true crisis at our southern bor-
der. Those in Washington who refuse to 
use the word ‘‘crisis’’ to describe the 
humanitarian and security challenges 
must 
accept 
the 
disastrous 
con-
sequences of an open-border policy. 
Just look at the numbers from the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
More than 2 million illegal immigrants 
were caught attempting to cross the 
border last year, and if the Biden ad-
ministration doesn’t get serious about 
securing the border, we are on pace to 
repeat or exceed this troubling figure 
in 2022. In December, 178,840 illegal im-
migrants were apprehended attempting 
to cross along this stretch of the bor-
der, making it the highest total for 
that month in Department of Home-
land Security history. 
I have been here before describing 
this chaos, but the reality is, it con-
tinues to escalate while the adminis-
tration refuses to take action to stop 
illegal immigration. 
Unsurprisingly, we are seeing the 
tensions between the Biden administra-
tion and Border Patrol officials boil 
over. These men and women have an-
swered the call to protect and serve. 
They put their lives at risk to enforce 
the law and arrest people illegally 
crossing the border, only to have the 
administration approve the release of 
the very criminals the officers locked 
up. This betrayal by the administra-
tion is creating low morale, with some 
Border Patrol officers choosing to 
leave the job rather than support this 
lawlessness and insanity. 
Instead of preventing illegal drugs 
from entering our country, border 
agents are spending time processing 
paperwork for illegal immigrants. 
Do you know who else is seeing this 
paperwork? TSA agents. The Depart-
ment of Homeland Security is allowing 
these lawbreakers to board airplanes 
using their Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement arrest warrants as identi-
fication at TSA checkpoints. This is 
totally absurd. It is a reckless policy 
that threatens the safety of air trav-
elers and all citizens. The administra-
tion must end this practice. 
The message coming from the White 
House is: Our southern borders are 
open. All are welcome. 
This has been a green light for immi-
grants since day one. It started with 
migrant numbers increasing along the 
southern 
border 
as 
they 
awaited 
Biden’s immigration action, and now 
we see the result. We have experienced 
record border crossings, overflowing 
detention centers, and the release of 
single adult migrants into the United 
States, among many other many prob-
lems. That is how it is going. 
It is not just citizens from Central 
America and Mexico who are taking 
advantage of this foolish generosity; 
people from Syria, Turkey, Russia, 
Pakistan, Cuba, Haiti, and India are il-
legally entering the United States 
along the southern border. 
I have been here before on the Senate 
floor sounding the alarm about the 
threat this dangerous and indefensible 
approach to immigration and border 
security is having on our country. It is 
threatening our sovereignty and under-
mining the rule of law. 
Instead of implementing common-
sense steps to secure the border, the 
administration has prioritized ‘‘border 
czar’’ Vice President HARRIS’s mission 
to discover the ‘‘root causes’’ of this 
crisis while the number of illegal im-
migrants 
entering 
our 
country 
is 
reaching historic levels. 
The reality is, this truly is a crisis of 
the Biden administration’s own mak-
ing. The President reversed policies 
that were curbing illegal immigration, 
like the construction of a border wall 
and the ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy. 
We 
must 
provide 
Border 
Patrol 
agents with the tools and resources to 
successfully accomplish their job. That 
involves enforcing the laws and holding 
illegal 
immigrants 
accountable 
for 
their unlawful actions, not helping 
them board airplanes to travel around 
the country. 
This is a matter of national security. 
My GOP colleagues and I are ready to 
get back to the effective strategies we 
had for controlling the border under 
President Trump, and it is time Presi-
dent Biden gets on board. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

AMERICAN MANUFACTURING 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we have 
had so much good news in Ohio and 
across the country over the last few 
weeks—rising 
wages, 
record 
job 
growth, a million jobs in 2 months. 
Intel is bringing 10,000 new good-pay-
ing manufacturing and trades jobs to 
Central Ohio. That facility will be built 
by union workers—electricians, car-
penters, laborers, pipefitters, and other 
workers of the skilled trades. 
Hyperion, a fuel manufacturer, is 
opening the largest factory built in Co-
lumbus in a decade, creating 700 jobs. 
GE Aviation with Boeing signed a 
new deal exporting planes built with 
next-generation jet engines developed 
in Southwest Ohio, supporting thou-
sands of Ohio jobs. 
As I was flying into Columbus with 
Senator PORTMAN a couple of weeks 
ago to join Intel to announce those 
jobs, I was thinking: Today we are fi-
nally burying the term ‘‘rust belt.’’ 
For too long, corporate elites on the 
coast have used that outdated, offen-
sive term—a term that demeans our 
workers and devalues our work. Now 
Ohio—the center of the country, the 
heart of the industrial Midwest—leads 
the way in the next generation of man-
ufacturing. 
The State that founded the auto in-
dustry and gave us the Wright Brothers 
is today making the most advanced 
chips that go into cars and phones and 
appliances. 
All of this is made possible because 
we are putting American workers at 
the center of our economy. It is not a 
coincidence we are seeing this record 
job growth, when we finally have a 
President who understands what car-
rying a union card means, who centers 
workers, who cares about wages, who 
comes from the industrial heartland—a 
union card that means better wages, a 
union card that means better benefits, 
a union card that often means a more 
flexible work schedule that workers 
have a decision and input into forming. 
And look at the results we are get-
ting. Last year, for the first time in 20 
years, our economy grew faster than 
China. Think about that. For the first 
time in two decades, the American 
economy grew faster than China’s 
economy. 
We know that China and other com-
petitors aren’t giving up. They are, 
every week, trying to find new ways to 
cheat, new ways to undermine Amer-
ican jobs. 
We need every possible tool to com-
pete. It is why last year in the Senate 
we passed the Innovation and Competi-
tion Act. We passed what we are now 
calling the Make it in America Act. It 
is a serious effort to invest in manufac-
turing research and development and 
bring and build supply chains back in 
the United States. 
It is going to mean jobs. It is going 
to bring down prices. For too long, we 
have had a trade policy and a tax pol-
icy lobbied in this body by corporate 
interests that wanted to move overseas 
for cheap labor. We have had a trade 
and 
tax 
policy 
that 
essentially 
hollowed out manufacturing in Ohio 
and across the Midwest. Ohioans know 
what permanent normal trade relations 
with China 20 years ago when Congress 
passed it—to be asked of corporate 
America and pushed by people like 
Newt Gingrich—people know what that 
did to our economy. Almost everyone 
knows 
the 
devastation 
the 
North 
American 
Free 
Trade 
Agreement 
caused to industrial towns in Ohio and 
across the country. 
PNTR and admitting China to the 
WTO hasn’t gotten the same media at-
tention, but Ohio steel companies and

other industries know how big a prob-
lem it has been. It is how we ended up 
with empty factories, lost dreams, sup-
ply chains that are too long, too frag-
ile, and that stretch all over the world 
instead of made in America. 
That is why I wrote the Leveling the 
Playing Field Act that was passed into 
law in 2015. It is why Senator PORTMAN 
and I are working to make sure that 
our bipartisan Leveling the Playing 
Field Act 2.0 is in the competition bill, 
the Made in America Act the House 
passed last week. 
Leveling the Playing Field has been 
critical for Ohio companies, allowing 
them to file and win trade cases 
against foreign companies that cheat 
the rules. We know our competition 
hasn’t stopped coming up with new 
ways to skirt these rules and distort 
the global market to benefit their own 
companies. 
The Chinese Government still sub-
sidizes steel. The Chinese Government 
engages in economic espionage to steal 
American trade secrets to prop up their 
own state-controlled companies. 
Look at the most recent conviction 
of a Chinese spy trying to steal GE 
Aviation’s pioneering jet engine de-
signs to swipe them and take them 
back to China. We need our trade laws 
to keep up. 
Both the Senate and the House bills 
include the CHIPS Act to invest in new 
semiconductor 
production 
in 
the 
United States, like the new Intel fac-
tory coming to Licking County, east 
and north of Columbus. Even though 
the United States started the semicon-
ductor industry, today those vital 
chips are mostly made overseas. 
Fewer than 10 percent of chips are 
made in this country. Right now, 75 
percent of chip manufacturing is in 
Taiwan, 
South 
Korea, 
Japan, 
and 
China. It has meant severe shortages 
and long waits for those chips that are 
critical inputs to so many of the prod-
ucts Americans rely on. 
We need to bring the supply chain 
back home, starting with Intel in Ohio, 
by passing the CHIPS Act. We must in-
vest in domestic manufacturing inno-
vation. It is what Missouri Republican 
Senator BLUNT and I worked together 
to do with our provisions in the Senate 
bill to create more manufacturing hubs 
across the country. 
The first one, as many in this body 
remember because they voted for it, 
was in Youngstown some years ago, 
something called America Makes. All 
of us in the Senate and the House need 
to get to work immediately to get 
these bills over the finish line. 
If you want to get a sense of how im-
portant this is, how strong these bills 
are, just look at what China is doing. 
The Chinese Communist Party is lob-
bying furiously against this bill. That 
is right. The CCP and its cronies, the 
communist party in China, are lob-
bying against the bill that invests in 
American innovation, supports Amer-
ican manufacturing, takes on unfair 
and illegal trade practices. They are 
scared, pure and simple. 
They 
know 
that 
pro-competition 
bills—the Make it in America Act—will 
have real consequences for their cheat-
ing and their trying to undermine 
American workers. 
A Reuters headline from November: 
‘‘Beijing urges U.S. businesses to lobby 
against China-related bills in Con-
gress.’’ 
I will say it again: ‘‘Beijing urges 
U.S. businesses to lobby against China- 
related bills in Congress.’’ 
Unfortunately—I won’t name them 
on the floor, maybe I should—but there 
are U.S. businesses that are lobbying 
against this because they do enough 
business in China, exploiting Chinese 
workers, evading any environmental 
laws or worker safety laws that may be 
in place. 
The Chinese Government threatens 
these American companies, recruiting 
them to lobby against the interests of 
American workers. This time we are 
not rolling over. We are going to stand 
up for American innovation, stand up 
for American manufacturing, stand up 
especially for American workers. 
As I said, we have a President now 
who puts workers at the center of our 
economic policy. We have a President 
who puts workers at the center of our 
economy. We have a President who is 
not afraid to talk about unions, know-
ing carrying a union card means a bet-
ter life for workers. 
We are going to get a strong bipar-
tisan bill that increases our economic 
competitors. We know how to speed up 
our supply chain and lower prices and 
end our reliance on China: make more 
things in this country. 
That is the solution to many of our 
economic problems: make it in Ohio. I 
urge my colleagues in both parties and 
both Chambers to go to work. Let’s get 
this done for American workers. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, many 
Americans are watching the news, 
reading the newspaper, watching cable 
news, and they are seeing the Russian 
buildup of troops on the border of 
Ukraine. 
So I thought what I would do is take 
just a few moments to speak about 
what is at stake in Ukraine. Why 
should 
Americans 
care, 
and 
what 
should we do in response? 
Tensions along the border are high. 
Shuttle diplomacy is occurring and is 
the order of the day. But more than 
100,000 Russian troops are in position 
should an invasion of Ukraine be or-
dered by Russian Federation President 
Putin. 
Reports indicate that Russia has cre-
ated a graphic propaganda video, some-
thing called a false flag operation, to 
serve as a pretext for invading and 
cyber attacks like those that might 
precede a planned invasion are already 
underway. 
Not surprisingly, the Kremlin is en-
gaging in a disinformation campaign, 
making every attempt to blame the 
United States—or any other country 
for that matter—for its own aggressive 
actions. 
This kind of gaslighting might work 
in a totalitarian state, but in the rest 
of the world, where we have access to 
more complete and accurate informa-
tion, we know better. There is no ques-
tion that Russia and Russia alone is re-
sponsible for the military buildup on 
Ukraine’s border and is also threat-
ening peace in Europe. 
As Frederick Kagan, a scholar at the 
American 
Enterprise 
Institute, 
has 
written: 
This isn’t primarily a Ukraine crisis. It’s a 
Russia crisis. More precisely, [it is] a Putin- 
created crisis aimed at destroying [the North 
Atlantic 
Treaty 
Organization, 
otherwise 
known as] NATO. 
It’s Putin’s attempt to drive the [United 
States] and its West European allies to put 
ourselves in a time machine, [to] abdicate 
our alliance obligations, expose countries 
previously occupied, brutalized, and ex-
ploited by the Soviet Union to Putin’s con-
tinued 
aggression, 
demonstrate 
our 
unreliability as partners, and show our 
unseriousness about defending our own vital 
national security interests. In return for a 
promise of nothing at all. 
The United States has played no part 
in creating this crisis, but I do believe 
we have some responsibilities—not just 
a treaty obligation to our NATO al-
lies—because Ukraine is not yet a 
member of NATO, so that obligation 
under article 5 does not apply to 
Ukraine, as I will discuss in a moment. 
But I do believe that we have a re-
sponsibility to support the Ukrainian 
people as they fight to defend their 
own sovereignty, despite the fact that 
they are not members of NATO. 
With so many challenges on the 
home front, though, and around the 
world, it is easy for folks in Texas or 
Massachusetts or anywhere else around 
the country to wonder, why should we 
care what is happening in Ukraine? 
Americans are experiencing the high-
est inflation in 40 years; there is grow-
ing concern about violent crime; we 
have a humanitarian crisis on our 
southern border; and let’s not forget 
the ongoing fight against the pan-
demic. We know families are struggling 
to face the challenges right in front of 
them, let alone those on the other side 
of the globe. 
Americans want to know, how does a 
conflict on the other side of the globe 
actually impact the United States and, 
importantly, why should we help? I 
think those are fair questions. The 
human and financial costs of armed 
conflicts are very high. And we have 
learned the painful lesson during many 
times in our Nation’s history, twice in 
the last century in Europe alone, where 
there were World Wars centered. 
But we also know how much the free 
world depends on the United States and 
its leadership and strength to provide 
stability and prevent wars and promote 
peace, if we can, while safeguarding 
freedom and democracy around the 
world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S565 
February 8, 2022 
The United States is a global power, 
but we are no longer the only one. That 
day has passed. Our leadership role and 
responsibilities in a rules-based inter-
national order were earned by the sac-
rifices of generations of Americans who 
defended our freedoms and our way of 
life and those of our allies. 
Believing, as Ronald Reagan said, 
that peace comes through strength, 
America’s role in the world has been 
achieved by our military might, by our 
strategic alliances, our commitment to 
free markets and trade around the 
world that have produced the economy 
that has allowed us to defend ourselves 
as well as an unwavering dedication to 
our values. And whether we like it or 
not, our unique role in the world brings 
with it certain responsibilities. 
We can’t give anyone—adversary or 
ally—a reason to doubt our commit-
ment to freedom, peace, stability, and 
security. Unfortunately, our reputa-
tion for reliability has suffered some 
damage recently. The botched with-
drawal from Afghanistan, for example, 
caused our NATO allies to doubt the 
future of American leadership and our 
commitments under the North Atlantic 
Treaty. 
Our friends and adversaries alike are 
wondering if the Afghanistan debacle is 
a one-time misstep or the beginning of 
dwindling U.S. commitment and power. 
Of course, Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi will 
not miss an opportunity to disparage 
America’s credibility as a reliable ally. 
Our urgent task, by our actions as 
well as our words, should be to con-
vince friend and foe that we will re-
main a credible friend and ally. 
But either way, Putin is an oppor-
tunist, and today the eyes of the world 
are on the United States to see how we 
will respond to this threatened Russian 
aggression. Will we stand strong in 
support of Ukraine or will we sit pas-
sively on the sidelines? 
Make no mistake, Russia is doing far 
more than just threatening Ukraine. 
President Putin told the world in a 
speech in 2005 that the collapse of the 
Soviet empire—the Soviet Union—was 
what he called ‘‘the greatest geo-
political catastrophe of the century.’’ 
That is his mindset. 
Putting that empire back together 
was clearly on his mind when Russia 
invaded the nation of Georgia in 2008, 
formerly part of the Soviet Union, and 
when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, 
also part of the Soviet order. 
And, of course, we can be confident 
this is foremost in his mind as he 
threatens to invade Ukraine, another 
country that used to be part of the So-
viet Union. 
So Putin is trying to get away with 
as much as he can, and it would be 
naive to think that he will stop at 
Ukraine. 
If the United States fails to support 
Ukraine at this pivotal moment, other 
authoritarian governments, like those 
in China and Iran, will take note. 
Today’s New York Times had a story 
that said, ‘‘Both Sides of the Taiwan 
Strait Are Closely Watching Ukraine’s 
Crisis,’’ in other words, the People’s 
Republic of China—mainland China—as 
well as Taiwan, the independent demo-
cratic state right across that thin band 
of water known as the South China 
Sea. 
Here is what one of the representa-
tives of Taiwan said in this article. He 
said: ‘‘If the Western powers fail to re-
spond to Russia, they do embolden the 
Chinese thinking regarding action on 
Taiwan.’’ 
So this is not just about Ukraine. 
This is not just about Europe. This is 
about America’s credibility and that of 
our friends and allies around the world 
and our willingness to stand up for our 
values and defend our freedoms. 
If our adversaries see that the United 
States responds merely with passivity 
or words, they too will inevitably see 
opportunities for them to exploit. That 
would risk further geopolitical insta-
bility and the cause of peace. It would 
inevitably diminish America’s leader-
ship position in the world, the global 
order of which we are what Elbridge 
Colby has termed the ‘‘cornerstone bal-
ancer,’’ a powerful country anchoring 
the coalition of freedom-loving na-
tions. 
So, yes, Ukraine is on the frontlines 
of the current crisis, but the security 
of Europe is also in question. The reach 
of Russia’s aspirations for reestab-
lished empire are, as well, and, as I 
said, there are global repercussions to 
however we choose to respond. 
I am not suggesting that President 
Biden 
send 
American 
troops 
to 
Ukraine. I want to be clear on that 
point. I know of no one calling for 
American troops to be deployed to 
Ukraine. 
There are, however, concrete steps 
we can take to help Ukraine defend 
itself without putting American lives 
on the line, and, fortunately, there is 
precedent for that. 
In the early 1940s, Nazi Germany was 
making dramatic advances across Eu-
rope, and Great Britain was being pum-
meled by the blitz, a bombing cam-
paign by the German air forces. While 
Britain was hanging on by a thread, 
Prime Minister Churchill asked Presi-
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt for 
help from the United States. 
This ultimately resulted in a very 
creative and successful solution known 
as the Lend-Lease Act. In the words of 
President Roosevelt, this legislation 
transformed the United States into the 
‘‘arsenal of democracy’’ by supplying 
Great Britain with the materiel it 
needed to fend off German attacks. 
He compared it to lending your 
neighbor a garden hose if his house was 
on fire. It wouldn’t just protect the 
neighbor’s home; it would protect your 
home as well. 
Congress and the American people 
agreed 
with 
President 
Roosevelt’s 
logic, and this legislation was signed 
into law in March 1941. 
Soon after, American warships, air-
craft, weaponry, oil, food, and other 
critical 
resources 
made 
their 
way 
across the Atlantic to Allied forces 
fighting against Germany. 
I think this is part of the response we 
need to provide today to provide the 
Ukrainians with the ability to defend 
themselves under a modern version of 
the 1941 Lend-Lease Act. 
With the inspiration of President 
Roosevelt in the 1941 act, I have 
worked with a number of my col-
leagues—Republicans and Democrats 
alike—to draft a 2022 version of that 
legislation, called, not surprisingly, 
the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend- 
Lease Act, which will ensure that 
Ukrainian forces and the Ukrainian 
people will have what they need to 
deter and defend against Russian inva-
sions. 
As it stands today, the President of 
the United States has a menu of op-
tions to support our international 
friends in times of conflict. In some 
cases, such as the loan of equipment, 
the United States will eventually re-
tain end use. In others, such as grants 
and emergency aid, we do not recover 
the funding or the assets sent to our 
friends. 
This bill would provide an additional 
option to that menu, allowing the 
United States to provide assistance 
that may otherwise be unfeasible un-
less we could retain end use. 
This 
legislation 
would 
authorize 
President Biden to enter into lend- 
lease agreements directly with Ukraine 
and provide military equipment nec-
essary to protect the Ukrainian people. 
In an ideal world, access to this ma-
teriel will help the Ukrainians defend 
themselves and deter Russia from 
mounting an invasion in the first 
place. Knowing that Ukraine has ac-
cess to the ‘‘arsenal of democracy’’ 
could help prevent Putin from risking 
a deadly war. But if Putin makes a bad 
decision to move forward, Ukrainian 
forces will have the lethal weapons 
that they need to defend their sov-
ereignty. 
They will also have the support of 
the United States and our NATO allies. 
In the Senate, there is clear support 
for this sovereignty of Ukraine, and I 
am glad to have worked with my col-
leagues on this legislation that in-
cludes this lend-lease component. 
I want to thank Chairman MENENDEZ 
and Ranking Member RISCH on the For-
eign Relations Committee and a larger 
bipartisan group of our colleagues who 
have been working on a comprehensive 
approach to counter this threatened 
aggression by Russia. We have dis-
cussed my lend-lease bill, as well as ad-
ditional security assistance and lethal 
aid for Ukraine. And, as we have read, 
Senator MENENDEZ and Senator RISCH 
are negotiating a limited but imme-
diate sanctions response to this aggres-
sion, including cyber attacks, as well 
as the threat of additional sanctions in 
the event of an invasion. 
As the chairman and the ranking 
member have said, negotiations are 
making some progress, and I hope we

can wrap things up quickly and bring 
the bill to the Senate floor without 
much more delay. 
The fact is, we are racing against the 
clock. Putin could invade Ukraine at a 
moment’s notice, and he is not going to 
wait on the U.S. Senate to act. That is 
why time is of the essence. 
Ideally, the lend-lease agreement, 
military 
assistance, 
sanctions, 
and 
other provisions included in this pack-
age will cause Putin to think twice 
about invading. But that can only hap-
pen if we act before Putin acts. 
So the clock is ticking, and we need 
to move. I am encouraged by the bipar-
tisan support we have seen for Ukraine 
and for this effort, and I hope we can 
take action soon to reaffirm America’s 
position as the lead defender of global 
peace and security. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
JCPOA 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, the 
world was safer when the JCPOA, the 
Iran nuclear agreement negotiated by 
President Obama, was in place. The 
world became a much less safe place 
when President Trump tore up that 
agreement against the advice of his 
Secretary of State and his Secretary of 
Defense. 
We have an opportunity right now to 
reconstruct that agreement—or the 
most important elements of it—so that 
Iran once again is as far as possible 
from being able to obtain a nuclear 
weapon. That would make the region 
safer. That would make the United 
States safer. 
But time is of the essence. U.S. nego-
tiators, European negotiators, the Rus-
sians, the Chinese, and the Iranians are 
right now entering what could be the 
last round of discussions, and it is ab-
solutely imperative that the U.S. Sen-
ate provide this administration with 
the support it needs to effectuate an 
agreement. 
I want to talk to my colleagues for a 
few minutes about how important it is 
for the United States and our European 
allies—for the world, indeed—to recon-
struct a diplomatic agreement with 
Iran. 
And I want to also talk for a moment 
about how disastrous the last 5 years 
have been—a period of time during 
which the United States has largely 
been out of compliance with that 
agreement. 
The JCPOA was signed by the United 
States and European allies and was en-
tered into, on behalf of a coalition that 
included Russia and China, with the 
Iranian Government. It was signed in 
July of 2015, and within about 6 
months, the IAEA was able to verify 
that Iran had completed its obligations 
under the nuclear agreement. 
This 
included 
commitments 
that 
would increase the amount of time 
that Iran needed to acquire enough ma-
terial for a nuclear weapon from 2 to 3 
months—that was the amount of time 
that it would have taken them prior to 
the nuclear agreement—to at least a 
year or more. 
The agreement reduced Iran’s stock-
piles of enriched uranium by requiring 
it to ship 25,000 pounds of it out of the 
country. Iran committed to disman-
tling and removing two-thirds of its 
centrifuges. It modified its heavy water 
reactor at Arak and filled it with con-
crete so that it could never be used 
again, preventing Iran from producing 
weapons-grade plutonium. And, finally, 
Iran agreed to provide unprecedented 
access to its nuclear facilities and to 
its nuclear supply chain—not only the 
sites that we knew about, but it also 
agreed to adopt what are called the ad-
ditional protocols which allow the 
IAEA to be able to request and get ac-
cess to sites in which they might have 
some suspicion that there was new pro-
hibited nuclear research activity hap-
pening. 
Under this deal, Iran reduced its 
stockpile of uranium by 98 percent. It 
kept its level of uranium enrichment 
at 3.67 percent, significantly below the 
levels that you would need to make a 
bomb. 
The JCPOA, as I said, got the Ira-
nians to reduce their number of cen-
trifuges from 20,000 to 6,000. 
And so this was the world that Presi-
dent 
Trump 
inherited—the 
United 
States, Europe, Russia, and China 
united on Iran policy; Iran shutting 
down major elements of their nuclear 
research program, such that they were 
now more than a year out from getting 
a nuclear weapon if they made the de-
cision to achieve a nuclear weapon. 
That is called the breakout time, the 
time from which a country decides it 
wants a nuclear weapon to the point at 
which it has a nuclear weapon. For 
Iran, that went from 2 to 3 months 
prior to the agreement to over a year 
after the agreement. 
But it also lined up the United 
States, Europe, China, and Russia— 
this unlikely alliance of traditional ad-
versaries, at least with respect to Rus-
sia and China—so that we could then 
move on to Iran’s other malevolent be-
haviors. 
Critics of the deal said it only per-
tains to the nuclear program, but that 
is not the only bad behavior that Iran 
is engaged in. 
Well, President Trump inherited a 
united front of unlikely allies that 
then could be utilized to pressure Iran 
to make changes to its ballistic missile 
program, to reduce its support for ter-
rorist organizations and proxy armies 
around the region. That is why Sec-
retary Tillerson and Secretary Mattis 
and many other Trump advisers en-
couraged him to stay in the deal. 
But he didn’t. President Trump tore 
up the deal and announced to the coun-
try and the world that he was going to 
pursue a different strategy. 
Critics of JCPOA said that President 
Obama shouldn’t have entered into an 
agreement. Critics said that he should 
have held out and kept applying more 
and more sanctions, even if the Euro-
peans walked away, as a means of get-
ting Iran to come to the table on a 
broader agreement that would include 
its ballistic missile program and its 
support for terrorists. 
President Obama believed it was im-
portant to get the nuclear question off 
the table. But to the extent there was 
any silver lining of President Trump’s 
decision, it is that it allowed us for 4 
years to test the theory of the oppo-
nents, the theory of the critics, be-
cause President Trump implemented 
the strategy that the critics of the 
JCPOA wanted President Obama to 
employ. 
Donald Trump imposed greater sanc-
tions. He did it without the Europeans, 
and he demanded that he would only 
talk to the Iranians if they came to the 
table on everything. In fact, he set it 
down on a piece of paper. 
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 
gave Iran a list of 12 demands and said 
that we will come to the table and talk 
to you and we will consider releasing 
these sanctions if you talk to us about 
all of your dangerous behaviors in the 
region—your nuclear program, your 
ballistic missile program, your support 
for terrorists. So President Trump gave 
us the gift of testing the theory of the 
opponents. You know how the story 
goes. It was a spectacular failure. 
It was a spectacular failure in mul-
tiple respects. First, let’s just talk 
about what happened to Iran’s nuclear 
program. In May 2019 Iran announces 
that it will no longer observe the 
JCPOA stockpile limit. And, as of No-
vember of last year, the stockpile of 
enriched uranium—enriched uranium 
gas—was roughly 11 times what it was 
during the agreement. 
In July 2019, Iran began enriching 
uranium up to 4.5 percent, above 3.6 
percent, as specified in the agreement. 
In January of 2021, it began enriching 
uranium to 20 percent; in April of 2021, 
up to 60 percent. 
In September 2019, Iran announced it 
would no longer be bound by any re-
search and development limitations on 
advanced centrifuges. They 
started 
that research again. 
In November 2019, Iran announced 
that it would start enriching uranium 
at Fordow up to 4.5 percent. Under the 
JCPOA, enrichment at Fordow was 
prohibited for 15 years. By January of 
last year, Iran was enriching uranium 
to 20 percent at Fordow. 
And in November of 2020, Iran’s Par-
liament passed a bill requiring the 
country to build that new heavy water 
reactor at Arak that allows them a 
path to plutonium. Once built, that re-
actor will be capable of producing 
enough plutonium annually for two nu-
clear weapons. 
And since February of this year, Iran 
has been restricting that IAEA access 
to its facilities. It no longer complies 
with the additional protocols. So if you 
ask for access to a site in which you 
think there is new nuclear research ac-
tivity being undertaken, Iran no longer 
feels obligated to grant that access.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S567 
February 8, 2022 
Iran went to a breakout time of 2 to 
3 months to a breakout time under the 
agreement of more than a year, to, 
today, a breakout time of 2 months— 
arguably less than the breakout time 
prior to the deal. 
But it is important to also note that 
during these last 4 years, none of Iran’s 
other malevolent activities in the re-
gion have abated. In fact, arguably, 
they have gotten worse. Iran continues 
to support proxy armies in Syria, 
Yemen, Lebanon. In fact, their connec-
tion with Hezbollah in Lebanon and 
with the Houthis in Yemen is probably 
stronger today than it was during the 
JCPOA. 
After President Trump backed out of 
the JCPOA, Iran restarted attacks on 
U.S. troops. Now, Iran has been en-
gaged in permanent destabilizing ac-
tivities in Iraq since the outset of that 
war, but during the period of time that 
we were in the JCPOA, they were not 
shooting directly at U.S. troops. Their 
proxy armies had stood down. Once we 
were outside of the JCPOA, those at-
tacks started again. In fact, one rocket 
that was sent by a proxy army at a 
U.S. staff base in Iraq could have killed 
100 U.S. troop members. It just nar-
rowly missed. 
The Iranians have undertaken at-
tacks against the Saudis that they 
never would have contemplated while 
the JCPOA was in effect, taking action 
against Saudi oil facilities, including a 
high-profile 
attack 
against 
Saudi 
Aramco. 
And their proxy armies, similarly, 
are firing at our friends in the Gulf. 
Just in the last few months, we have 
seen an increased level of drone at-
tacks and missile attacks against 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE from inside 
Yemen. 
One of my Republican colleagues 
here in this body claimed that Trump’s 
Iran policy had ‘‘restored deterrence.’’ 
That is a laughable proposition because 
it did exactly the opposite. Once we got 
out of that agreement, Iran started 
their nuclear research program to the 
point that it is stronger than it was 
prior to the JCPOA in some ways. They 
didn’t stop any of their other desta-
bilizing activity. It got worse, and they 
didn’t come back to the table. 
The whole point of the critics of the 
Obama policy was that if we had just 
kept on applying sanctions, Iran would 
come to the table on everything. 
Trump tried it. It didn’t work. Iran 
didn’t come to the table on anything. 
Their actions in the region, their ac-
tions against the United States, their 
nuclear research program just got 
more serious and worse. 
Listen, diplomacy is not weakness. 
News flash: Occasionally there are dip-
lomatic agreements that are in the 
best interests of the United States, and 
the JCPOA was inarguably one of 
them. The data tells a clear story. 
Iran wasn’t a good actor during the 
JCPOA. They were still engaged in all 
sorts of deleterious activity. But Don-
ald Trump inherited the ability to use 
that coalition that was built to build 
the JCPOA to take on that other activ-
ity. He inherited a nuclear research 
program which was controlled, and he 
threw it all away. 
What is interesting is that many of 
our allies who were very skeptical of 
the JCPOA when it was signed are now 
very supportive of the United States 
reentering it. It tells you that they see 
the same story that I am telling you. 
Our Gulf allies, who were among the 
most vocal opponents of the JCPOA in 
2014 and 2015, sent out a joint state-
ment urging ‘‘a mutual return to full 
compliance of the JCPOA.’’ This was a 
deal that the Gulf nations opposed, and 
they now support the United States en-
tering back into it. 
And a cavalcade of Israeli officials— 
former intelligence and defense offi-
cials who can now feel freer to speak 
about their personal views—have been 
equally clear about the need to get 
back into this agreement. 
Tamir Pardo was the former director 
of Mossad. For 5 years he directed the 
Mossad. He said: 
What happened in 2018 was a tragedy. It 
was an unforgiveable strategy, the fact that 
Israel pushed the United States to withdraw 
from the agreement 10 years early. It was a 
strategic mistake. 
Amos Yadlin, the former chief of the 
IDF military intelligence unit, a job he 
held for 4 years, said: ‘‘If we want to be 
honest, 
what 
postponed 
Iranian 
progress towards achieving nuclear 
weapons was the nuclear agreement— 
and not military action. . . . [Iran is] 
closer now than they have ever been 
before. And that is because of the very 
wrong policy . . .’’ of withdrawing from 
the agreement. 
Gadi Eisenkot, former IDF chief of 
staff said that ‘‘the fact that the U.S. 
withdrew in 2018 from the . . . deal re-
leased Iran from all restrictions and in-
spections in the deal, even if there were 
holes [in the agreement], and brought 
Iran to the most advanced position 
today with regard to its nuclear pro-
gram.’’ 
And so, so many of our friends in the 
region see the need to get back into 
this agreement. The status quo is not 
acceptable. 
Now, it is not going to be easy be-
cause there are elements of Iran’s 
progress in nuclear research that are 
difficult, if not impossible, to undo 
given how much new research, how 
many advanced centrifuges they have 
built since President Trump left the 
agreement. 
And, quite frankly, there are some 
sanctions that we have applied to Iran 
since the nuclear agreement that we 
aren’t going to release, because we told 
the Iranians and the world that we 
were going to apply sanctions to Iran 
relevant to their ballistic missile pro-
gram and their support for terrorist or-
ganizations, and we did that—some of 
them under President Trump. Those 
aren’t going to go away. 
But it is important for the Biden ad-
ministration to see that many of the 
sanctions that Trump put in place dur-
ing that period of time may have 
sounded good, but they had no impact 
on Iranian behavior. 
I would put on that list the sanc-
tioning of the Iranian Revolutionary 
Guard and the sanctioning of the Su-
preme Leader. These aren’t good peo-
ple, but those sanctions didn’t change 
Iran’s behavior for the better. In fact, 
during that period of time, their behav-
ior got worse. Their nuclear research 
program became more advanced. And 
so, if releasing those designations or 
sanctions are required in order to make 
the world safer and get Iran back into 
the nuclear box, then I hope the admin-
istration will give serious consider-
ation. 
I hope the administration under-
stands the vital importance of getting 
back into this agreement and being 
willing to do the tough things in order 
to achieve a new nuclear agreement 
with the Iranians. 
The Iranians are going to have to 
make concessions as well. The Iranians 
are going to have to make some serious 
changes to their current scope of nu-
clear research. But it is the only way 
to unlock sanctions relief for a country 
that badly needs it. There is no way for 
the current President of Iran to make 
good on all the promises he made with-
out the sanctions relief. 
But time is of the essence. Time is of 
the essence. President Biden promised 
to restart diplomacy with Iran to make 
the world a safer place by getting back 
into a nuclear agreement. This is the 
moment to do it, and I would urge the 
administration to take all of the smart 
steps necessary in order to prevent 
Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, 
making the region and the world a 
safer place. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO DAVID FERRIERO 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is ap-
propriate to take a moment here in the 
Senate to recognize David Ferriero, the 
10th Archivist of the United States. 
Mr. Ferriero has held the top position 
at the National Archives since 2009, 
overseeing the maintenance and preser-
vation of critical documents like the 
Constitution and the Declaration of 
Independence, along with 10 million 
maps, 13 million pages of text, and tens 
of millions of photographs. On January 
13, 2022, Mr. Ferriero announced his in-
tention to retire in April. 
Prior to his nomination and con-
firmation to be Archivist of the United 
States, David Ferriero spent decades as 
a librarian and library administrator 
for some of the largest research insti-
tutions and public library networks. 
After service in the U.S. Navy during 
the Vietnam war, Mr. Ferriero worked 
as a librarian at the Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology for over three 
decades. In 1996, he moved to North 
Carolina, where he served as the vice 
provost for library affairs at Duke Uni-
versity, where he helped to develop the 
Triangle Research Library Network to 
facilitate greater access to research 
materials and collaboration across uni-
versities. Later, Mr. Ferriero was ap-
pointed the Andrew W. Mellon director 
and chief executive of the research li-
braries of the New York Public Library 
system. 
David Ferriero was nominated by 
President Obama and confirmed to be 
Archivist of the United States by the 
Senate in November 2009. Throughout 
his tenure as the leader of the National 
Archives, Mr. Ferriero made it his goal 
to bring the Archives and its vast 
range of historical records into the 21st 
century. He focused on digitizing the 
Archives’ 
materials 
and 
improving 
availability of these materials online 
so that more Americans could access 
and benefit from these primary source 
records. Under his leadership, the Na-
tional Archives also embraced social 
media and worked hard to bring more 
Americans into the creation, organiza-
tion, and maintenance of our Nation’s 
history and records. 
The documents and records main-
tained by the National Archives reflect 
the foundation and continuing story of 
our democracy and our Nation. They 
outline and define the evolution of the 
United States, documented throughout 
the pages of history, and preserved at 
the Archives as original source mate-
rial. At this critical juncture in our 
endless march toward a more perfect 
union, our history becomes even more 
instructive. 
Mr. Ferriero’s commitment to mak-
ing our Nation’s archives more open 
and more available to all of us is to be 
commended and will be a hallmark of 
his tenure as the Archivist of the 
United States. I wish Mr. Ferriero and 
his wife, Gail, all the best in the next 
chapter of their lives. 
I ask unanimous consent that a pro-
file of Mr. Ferriero, appearing in The 
Washington Post on January 13, 2022, 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, Jan. 13, 2022] 
DAVID S. FERRIERO, ARCHIVIST OF THE UNITED 
STATES, IS RETIRING 
(By Michael E. Ruane) 
David S. Ferriero, who has been the archi-
vist of the United States for more than a 
decade under three presidents, is planning to 
retire in April. 
Ferriero, 76, has been head of the National 
Archives and Records Administration since 
he was appointed by President Barack 
Obama and confirmed by the Senate in 2009. 
‘‘It has been the honor of a lifetime,’’ 
Ferriero wrote in a note to his staff Wednes-
day. ‘‘My time here has been filled with op-
portunities, challenges, and awesome respon-
sibilities. . . . I am humbled and awestruck 
and so deeply grateful—grateful to all of 
you.’’ 
In addition to housing national treasures 
such as the Declaration of Independence, the 
Constitution and the Bill of Rights, the Na-
tional Archives holds 13 billion pages of text, 
10 million maps, charts and drawings, as well 
as tens of millions of photographs, films and 
other records. 
The archives is also responsible for the na-
tion’s 13 brick-and-mortar presidential li-
braries. 
Before coming to the agency, Ferriero was 
director of the New York Public Libraries 
and served in top positions at the libraries of 
the Massachusetts Institution of Technology 
and Duke University. A native of Beverly, 
Mass., he served as a Navy hospital corps-
man during the Vietnam War. 
A self-described introvert, he is reserved 
and has a dry sense of humor. On his watch 
in 2014, the National Archives held its first 
sleepover. 
He has pushed the digitization of the ar-
chives, and he embraced social media. In No-
vember, he noted in a blog post, ‘‘We know 
that not everyone can come to our facilities 
[for research] and providing these records on-
line democratizes access.’’ 
He has also promoted the role of ‘‘citizen 
archivists’’ who volunteer to transcribe and 
review historic documents online. 
‘‘I have met or known half of all Archivists 
of the United States . . . and none has done 
better’’ than Ferriero, historian Michael 
Beschloss tweeted. 
One of the items framed in Ferriero’s office 
is a copy of a letter he wrote to President 
John F. Kennedy when he was in high school. 
The letter had been found at the Kennedy 
Presidential Library in Boston. 
The future archivist asked about the Peace 
Corps and requested a photo of JFK. 
Later, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presi-
dential Library found two letters Ferriero 
had written to President Eisenhower as a 
youngster, and the Lyndon B. Johnson Presi-
dential Library found one he had written to 
President 
Johnson. 
Ferriero 
had 
them 
framed in his office, too. 
In 2020, the National Archives faced criti-
cism when it posted in its headquarters 
building an exhibit with a picture that had 
been altered to blur out words suggesting 
criticism of President Donald Trump. 
The large color photograph, designed to 
celebrate the centennial of women’s suffrage, 
showed a massive protest crowd on Pennsyl-
vania Avenue during the Women’s March on 
Jan. 21, 2017, the day after Trump’s inaugura-
tion. The original photo had been altered to 
obscure some words on signs held by march-
ers. 
A placard that proclaimed ‘‘God Hates 
Trump’’ had ‘‘Trump’’ blotted out so that it 
read ‘‘God Hates.’’ A sign that read ‘‘Trump 
& GOP—Hands Off Women’’ had the word 
‘‘Trump’’ blurred out. 
Less than 24 hours after Washington Post 
reporter Joe Heim pointed out the alter-
ations, the National Archives apologized. 
‘‘We made a mistake,’’ it said in a state-
ment. ‘‘As the National Archives of the 
United States, we are and have always been 
completely committed to preserving our ar-
chival holdings, without alteration. 
‘‘We were wrong to alter the image,’’ it 
said. ‘‘We apologize, and will immediately 
start a thorough review of our exhibit poli-
cies and procedures so that this does not 
happen again.’’ 
The altered picture was removed and re-
placed with an unaltered one. 
‘‘Our credibility, so important to our mis-
sion, understandably has been questioned.’’ 
Ferriero wrote on his blog. ‘‘I take full re-
sponsibility for this decision and the broader 
concerns it has raised . . . [and] pledge to re-
store public confidence in this great institu-
tion.’’ 
The National Archives is headquartered in 
a massive 84-year-old granite and limestone 
landmark on Pennsylvania Avenue in Wash-
ington’s Federal Triangle. A ‘‘temple to 
American history.’’ Ferriero called it. 
The agency also has a large, more modern 
complex in College Park, Md. 
Deputy Archivist Debra Steidel Wall will 
serve as acting archivist until the president 
nominates and the Senate confirms a suc-
cessor. 
‘‘It is not easy to leave you with our im-
portant work continuing, especially initia-
tives to foster equity and enhance the em-
ployee and customer experiences,’’ Ferriero 
told his staff. ‘‘However, our profession is 
one of stewardship, where despite our endur-
ing responsibilities, we are here for what 
amounts to a brief period of time.

S569 
February 8, 2022 
Vermont business that I have turned to 
year after year for gifts for our chil-
dren, grandchildren, other relatives 
and friends. 
Today, Maple Landmark is one of the 
most prominent handmade wooden toy 
manufacturers in the United States. 
However, like many businesses, it 
started small, in Mike Rainville’s fam-
ily woodshop in rural Vermont in the 
1980s. Mike’s business began with build-
ing and selling mostly cribbage boards 
and tic-tac-toe games, but quickly 
grew to encompass a wide range of 
toys, games, puzzles, and home decora-
tions. Among Maple Landmark’s most 
famous products are the wooden letter 
train sets that have graced the bed-
rooms of millions of children across 
the country. They are also in the 
Leahy homes. 
Over the past 40 years, due to its 
beautiful 
craftsmanship 
and 
joyful 
products, Maple Landmark has been 
able to expand its sales operation to 
toy stores and distributors throughout 
the United States and abroad. All the 
while, it has maintained all manufac-
turing 
and 
sourcing 
operations 
in 
Vermont, 
at 
their 
facility 
in 
Middlebury. Mike and his team’s devo-
tion to their craft has allowed for the 
development of a strong homegrown 
business in Vermont that has helped to 
show the world all that our State has 
to offer. 
In March 2020, as much of the world 
shut down and many families and chil-
dren began learning, working, and 
spending more time at home, the popu-
larity of Maple Landmark’s toys and 
games exploded. Facing an unprece-
dented increase in orders from across 
the United States, Maple Landmark 
has been firing on all cylinders. This 
past holiday season was its busiest yet. 
Unfortunately, Landmark Maple has 
not been immune to the labor short-
ages that continue to strain businesses 
nationwide. While labor shortages are 
nothing 
new 
for 
many 
businesses 
across rural communities in Vermont, 
those brought on by the COVID–19 pan-
demic have been particularly chal-
lenging. The inability to find a sustain-
able workforce coupled with the great-
er effort necessary to recruit and train 
new workers has made it more difficult 
for Landmark Maple to take advantage 
of rising demand that would otherwise 
be a boon for the business. 
The story of Landmark Maple is far 
from unique, and it reaffirms that we 
need to do all we can to control the 
pandemic, vaccinate the population, 
and fully restore the economy. Every-
one who can get vaccinated must get 
vaccinated. Everyone who is eligible 
for a booster shot, must get their 
booster shot. If we make these respon-
sible choices and continue to prioritize 
the collective health and safety of our 
families and communities, more Amer-
icans will be willing and able to enter, 
reenter, and remain in the workforce. 
In doing so, we will be able to ensure 
that businesses like Maple Landmark 
Woodcraft can continue to operate and 
contribute to their communities for 
years to come. 
Maple Landmark was profiled in a 
November 10, 2021, article published in 
the Washington Post. I ask unanimous 
consent that the article titled, ‘‘Ho, ho, 
no: For maker of wooden toys, the 
struggle ahead of Christmas is not find-
ing supplies, but finding workers’’ be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post, Nov. 10, 2021] 
HO, HO, NO; FOR MAKER OF WOODEN TOYS, 
THE STRUGGLE AHEAD OF CHRISTMAS IS NOT 
FINDING SUPPLIES, BUT FINDING WORKERS 
(By Jeanne Whalen) 
With eight weeks to go until Christmas, 
tensions were running high at one of 
Vermont’s oldest toymakers. As hammers 
fell on hardwood and machine tools cut train 
engines, managers gathered around a table 
to confront a daunting list of unfilled orders. 
‘‘We need 32 sets of chess pieces. I don’t 
have 32 sets,’’ assembly supervisor Anne 
Cummings told half a dozen colleagues, 
sparking a quick discussion of when the 
items might appear. 
‘‘Umm, hobby horses? We’ll want at least 
three to get finished by tomorrow at the lat-
est,’’ process engineer Adam Rainville told 
the workshop foreman. 
Unlike much of the toy industry, Maple 
Landmark isn’t suffering from a lack of im-
ported materials as global supply lines buck-
le. The maker of wooden toys gets nearly all 
its lumber from nearby mills and has little 
trouble buying lacquer, paint and sandpaper 
from its Vermont suppliers. 
As it fields an unprecedented crush of or-
ders, the main factor holding it back is a 
shortage of workers. 
‘‘We’re just really, really busy and hiring 
workforce 
is 
a 
challenge,’’ 
said 
Mike 
Rainville, who founded the business 40 years 
ago. ‘‘We could use more in assembly. We can 
use more in the shop. I mean, really, any 
production position we can probably use help 
in. 
Rainville has been trying for weeks to hire 
three or four workers to add to his crew of 
46, but competition is fierce. The cheese fac-
tory up the road has eight open positions. 
The cidery next door and the teddy bear fac-
tory on Route 7 have large ‘‘Help Wanted’’ 
signs outside. Maple Landmark has raised its 
average wage rate by more than 7 percent 
over the last year, Rainville said—the aver-
age production worker earns over $15 an 
hour—but some local companies with deeper 
pockets are offering signing bonuses, a perk 
Rainville said he can’t afford to match. 
With an unemployment rate of only 2.9 
percent, Vermont is an extreme example of a 
problem plaguing employers across the coun-
try. In some regions, a shortage of workers is 
more challenging to Christmas preparations 
than the global scarcity of semiconductors 
or the cargo deluge overwhelming ports. 
A nationwide shopping spree is exacer-
bating the strain on companies like Maple 
Landmark. Flush with cash from nearly two 
years of forgoing restaurant meals and trav-
el, Americans are bingeing on products— 
electronics, clothes, gifts and anything else 
they can click into an online shopping cart. 
In September, household spending on goods 
was 14 percent higher than it was as the pan-
demic was beginning in February 2020, ac-
cording to David Wilcox, an economist with 
the Peterson Institute for International Eco-
nomics. If normal pre-pandemic trends had 
continued, demand for goods would be only 5 
percent higher now, he said. 
Maple Landmark felt the surge as soon as 
it began. In early 2020, Rainville was grum-
bling to his staff about the surplus of Chi-
nese checkers sets gathering dust in inven-
tory. But by April and May, as Americans 
were trapped indoors under lockdown, ‘‘we 
sold hundreds of them,’’ he said. 
A rush of online orders last year nearly 
made up for the collapse in Maple Land-
mark’s sales to shuttered retailers. Now, 
with many shops having reopened, ‘‘we’re 
getting hit from all sides,’’ Rainville said. 
‘‘Every week we are falling further behind 
our incoming orders.’’ 
Recently, the company stopped taking 
Christmas orders from new retailers so it 
could focus on its existing retail clients. 
Maple Landmark has searched for workers 
the conventional way—with posts on the em-
ployment 
website 
Indeed.com—and 
the 
quirky Vermont way, with a sign near its 
kindling pile behind the shop. 
The company leaves wood scraps there for 
anyone to take. This summer, Rainville 
tacked a piece of paper to the shed: ‘‘Help 
Wanted. Employees get dibs on scrap wood! 
Apply inside.’’ 
That brought in a few candidates, leading 
to one hire. But other interviews led no-
where, perhaps because workers have so 
many choices, Rainville said. 
‘‘People come in thinking that, gosh, mak-
ing toys, that sounds like fun,’’ he said. 
‘‘Once they take a tour through the shop or 
something, they say, ‘Okay, this is work.’ 
And then, maybe if we had interest, we’d call 
them in for a second interview and they 
don’t respond.’’ 
It’s also hard to find people good at work-
ing with their hands, Rainville said, a phe-
nomenon he attributes to the decline in 
farming life, which taught people to fix and 
build things. 
Vermont demographics—an aging popu-
lation and a shrinking workforce—were al-
ready working against employers before the 
pandemic. With the new consumption surge, 
competition for workers has become ex-
treme. 
A few months ago, Rainville found himself 
vying with the local school bus company for 
one employee. 
‘‘We almost came close to getting her on 
full-time in the summer, and then the bus 
company called her up and said, ‘We need 
you in the fall and we’re going to pay you 
anything to have you.’ ’’ 
Signs of the problem are everywhere. In 
nearby Burlington, several long shelves at a 
CVS Pharmacy were bare, including large 
sections 
missing 
school 
supplies 
and 
ibuprofen. An employee said the pharmacy 
couldn’t find enough workers to stock the 
shelves, while a sign on the door said the 
store was trimming its opening hours due to 
staffing shortages. 
Shopping at the CVS was Devlin Cahill- 
Garcia, a 20-year-old community college stu-
dent who earns $13 an hour working at a shop 
on the other side of town. ‘‘I do have a job at 
the moment, but I’m trying to find a better 
one, which is easier than ever now,’’ he said. 
When covid hit, some of Cahill-Garcia’s 
friends at the University of Vermont quit 
their part-time jobs in Burlington. Many 
haven’t returned, possibly because their par-
ents can support them, he said. ‘‘After being 
unemployed so long, I don’t think a lot of 
people want to go back to work,’’ he said 
Down the road, Lake Champlain Choco-
lates has asked its administrative staff, in-
cluding marketing director Allyson Myers, 
to take shifts in the factory to keep up with 
holiday demand that is 20 percent higher 
than in 2019. 
‘‘This has been a kind of organization-wide 
call of, ‘Okay, administrative team, we need 
you to step up and help us because we are

short,’ ’’ said Myers, who has pitched in bag-
ging Hanukkah gelt and peppermint patties. 
The family-owned company also held its 
first job fair this month to try to fill about 
20 openings and has raised its manufacturing 
starting wage by about 10 percent since last 
year, said Myers, who called the labor short-
age a bigger problem than supply-chain 
issues. 
Matt Parker, head of sales at Danforth 
Pewter, a workshop and retail business that 
sells ornaments and home decor, agreed with 
that assessment. The company has had no 
trouble getting pewter from its Rhode Island 
supplier but has struggled to fill about eight 
openings in production, customer service and 
retail, Parker said. 
The company has raised wages this year— 
by 5 to 10 percent, he estimated—and is offer-
ing bonuses to new and existing employees. 
Parker said he doesn’t know why it has been 
so hard to hire, but guessed that the pan-
demic ‘‘obviously threw a lot of people off 
entering the workforce’’ and made them 
worry about getting infected. 
At Maple Landmark, soaring demand and a 
lack of workers this summer stripped the 
company of its inventory, leaving it with lit-
tle to fill the holiday rush. As a result, the 
woodworkers are making things to order as 
purchases roll in. 
One of the company’s biggest sellers is the 
‘‘name train’’—a chain of brightly colored 
letters on wheels that spell a child’s name, 
between an engine and a caboose. Letters are 
everywhere in the workshop—an automated 
machine cutting a tray of O’s, a worker put-
ting wheels on a carton of red H’s. 
At the morning meeting, Cummings raised 
an urgent problem: They had run out of the 
letter E. 
‘‘Yellow E,’’ clarified Rainville’s mother, 
Pat Rainville, who works in production. The 
customer has specifically requested that 
color for that letter, so more would have to 
be made. 
At her station downstairs, Pat Rainville 
motioned toward a wall of shelves that 
should have been stuffed with boxes holding 
every letter in a variety of hues. But many 
of the shelves were empty. 
Things got so bad over one recent weekend 
that even the letter Q was in short supply, 
Mike Rainville said. ‘‘We know we’re low 
when even Q’s run out.’’

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
authority in section 4009 to allow the 
chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget to adjust budget aggregates and 
committee allocations after the enact-
ment of bipartisan infrastructure legis-
lation. Similarly, the reserve fund in 
section 3003 allows the chairman to re-
vise these levels as well as make ad-
justments to the pay-as-you-go ledger 
for legislation that would not increase 
the deficit over the period of 2022 to 
2031. 
H.R. 3684, the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act was enacted on No-
vember 15, 2021, meets the conditions of 
being bipartisan infrastructure legisla-
tion. As a result, I am revising the 
budget spending aggregates and the al-
location to the Committee on Appro-
priations by $3,230 million in outlays 
resulting from the increase in contract 
authority included in that bill. 
Furthermore, the combined budg-
etary impact of the direct spending and 
revenue provisions in that bill reduce 
the deficit over 10 years. The Congres-
sional Budget Office estimates that 
H.R. 3684 will decrease nonemergency 
mandatory outlays by $3.7 billion in 
2022 and by almost $90 billion over the 
period 2022 through 2031. Revenues will 
increase by more than $8 billion in 2022 
and more than $50 billion over the pe-
riod 2022 through 2031. As such, I am re-
vising the spending and revenue aggre-
gates and the allocation to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works by the relevant amounts. I am 
also revising the Senate pay-as-you-go 
scorecard. The Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act also increased dis-
cretionary spending; that spending is 
designated as an emergency and is 
therefore excluded from enforceable 
budgetary spending levels and com-
mittee allocations. 
Finally, section 4004 of the budget 
resolution allows the chairman to ad-
just budgetary levels for legislation 
containing disaster relief funding. I am 
increasing the outlay allocation to the 
Committee on Appropriations by $89 
million as a result of passage of H.R. 
5305, the Extending Government Fund-
ing and Delivering Emergency Assist-
ance Act, which was enacted on Sep-
tember 30, 2021. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

REMEMBERING DR. LESTER 
CARTER 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Lester Carter, who 
passed away on January 31, 2022, at the 
age of 90. Dr. Carter was a pharmacist 
who founded one of Milwaukee’s first 
Black-owned pharmacies and worked 
there for over five decades. 
Dr. Carter enlisted in the U.S. Navy 
and served in the Korean war. He was 
sent to the Hospital Corpsman School 
in Portsmouth, VA, for training in 
healthcare and was later assigned to 
the USS Tortuga for 2 and a half years. 
After being discharged in 1954, he at-
tended pharmacy school at Creighton 
University in Omaha, NE, and became 
the school’s first African-American 
graduate in 1958. Dr. Carter worked at 
a ‘‘Whites only’’ pharmacy in Omaha 
for 6 years, only being allowed to work 
in the backroom out of public view. 
After filling in at a pharmacy in Mil-
waukee, WI, Dr. Carter was offered a 
position at the store and moved to the 
city. He then began looking for his own 
store and found out about a pharmacy 
located 
on 
North 
24th 
and 
West 
Burleigh where the owners wanted to 
retire. Dr. Carter purchased the phar-
macy and set up shop in what at the 
time was a majority White and German 
neighborhood. Dr. Carter learned Ger-
man phrases and quickly earned a 
great deal of respect and trust from his 
customers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S571 
February 8, 2022 
During his career on Burleigh Street, 
Dr. Carter always welcomed everyone 
with a smile. He touched thousands of 
lives in positive ways, making time to 
talk and get to know his customers 
well. Dr. Carter saw many children 
grow up and become adults during his 
career, and some went on to become 
pharmacists due to his influence. 
Dr. Carter never retired after his 
pharmacy merged with Hayat, working 
part-time as the pharmacy’s herbal 
specialist. Recognizing people’s con-
cern for medication side effects he de-
veloped 12 herbal formulas to resolve 
health issues his customers were hav-
ing. He always listened to customer 
concerns and invested himself into the 
care of the community. 
Dr. Carter served as an example for 
Milwaukee on how to break down bar-
riers. He treated everyone with dignity 
and respect. A common consensus was 
that once you left his store, you were 
already feeling better just by being in 
his presence. In 2018, North 24th Street 
was named in his honor. While Dr. Car-
ter will be missed, he will be remem-
bered by the generations of families he 
helped take care of and by the commu-
nity he helped shape.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO PATTI ANNE LODGE 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleague Senator Jim Risch, 
we honor Idaho State Senator Patti 
Anne Lodge for her 22 years of service 
in the Idaho State Senate. 
Senator Lodge, an educator for 35 
years and agribusiness owner, is a dedi-
cated servant of the community. Her 
determination and patience are hall-
marks of her attentive problem solv-
ing. The list of committees, councils, 
task forces and boards she has led and 
devoted her time and talents to is ex-
tensive and diverse. They include her 
chairmanship of three senate commit-
tees: State affairs; judiciary and rules; 
and health and welfare. She has also 
cochaired the joint millennium fund 
committee and criminal justice rein-
vestment 
oversight 
committee, 
to 
name some of her many other leader-
ship roles. 
Her service stretches far beyond the 
State senate and well into the commu-
nities she represents, as she has served 
on the Boys & Girls Club Advisory 
Committee, Idaho Meth Project Advi-
sory Board, Nampa Chamber of Com-
merce, Caldwell Chamber of Commerce, 
and so much more. She has led local 
Republicans with distinction, serving 
as precinct chairman, Canyon County 
GOP chairman, president of the Idaho 
Federation of Republican Women, on 
the board of the National Republican 
Women, and more. 
It is no surprise she has earned many 
awards and recognitions for her com-
mitted service. They include her rec-
ognition as the Idaho Republican Sen-
ator of the Year in 2010 and Idaho Fra-
ternal Order of Police Legislator of the 
Year in 2014, her induction into the 
Idaho Republican Hall of Fame and so 
many more honors. 
Throughout, 
Senator 
Lodge 
has 
worked hard to be a good steward of 
tax dollars, promoted jobs and edu-
cational opportunities, backed per-
sonal 
accountability 
and 
responsi-
bility, and, overall, she has been a 
thoughtful, steadfast advocate for Can-
yon County residents, including the 
small family farmers and ranchers who 
call this wonderful part of our State 
home. 
Thank you, Senator Lodge, for you 
decades of service on behalf of Ida-
hoans. In addition, thank you to your 
friends and loved ones, especially your 
husband Edward J. Lodge; children 
Mary-Jeanne, Edward R. and Anne- 
Marie; and grandchildren, who have 
shared your time with our great State 
all these years. We congratulate you on 
your extraordinary career and wish 
you well.∑

f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor this evening to urge 
that Congress speak with one voice, at 
a critical time, on an urgent matter. 
The fight for freedom is being waged 
in Ukraine right now, and the outcome 
is going to have profound effects not 
just in Eastern Europe but around the 
globe. 
Russia has invaded Ukraine twice in 
the last 8 years, illegally annexing Cri-
mea, inserting troops and offensive 
military equipment into the Donbas re-
gion in the east. They have initiated 
cyber attacks against public and pri-
vate entities in Ukraine, and they con-
tinue to use disinformation to try to 
destabilize the democratically elected 
government in Kyiv. 
Now, the Russians have gone further 
by amassing more than 100,000 troops 
under the command of 100 tactical 
groups on Russia’s Ukrainian border. 
This 
Russian 
deployment 
includes 
rockets, tanks, and artillery, and it is 
no longer just on the eastern border of 
Ukraine but now on the northern bor-
der, where Russian combat troops and 
heavy equipment have moved into 
Belarus and in Crimea in the Black Sea 
area. 
Let me give a little history as to how 
we got here. Eight years ago, Ukraine 
made a choice. The people of Ukraine 
stood up to a corrupt Russian-backed 
government in 2014 and made a con-
scious decision to turn to the West—to 
the European Union, to the United 
States. 
I was in Ukraine in 2014 shortly after 
what is called the Euromaidan or the 
Revolution of Dignity. When I was 
there in 2014, the Revolution of Dignity 
barricades were still up, and in the cen-
ter of town, the Maidan was still occu-
pied by Ukrainian patriots who were 
determined that their country not go 
backwards. 
The Ukrainian people at that time 
rejected authoritarianism. They said 
instead they were choosing democracy, 
freedom of speech, and freedom to 
gather, respect for the rule of law and 
free markets—turning to us. 
Despite Russia’s unrelenting efforts 
at destabilization over the past 8 years, 
the Ukrainian people are more com-
mitted than ever to an independent, 
sovereign, and democratic nation. And 
Ukrainians today are increasingly pa-
triotic and opposed to the Russian ef-
forts to destabilize their country. They 
don’t want state control, repression, 
and fear; they choose liberty and pros-
perity. 
Moscow would have the world believe 
that somehow this massive, unwar-
ranted Russian buildup is about trying 
to shore up its border against threats 
from Ukraine and NATO. This is, of 
course, patently false. Ukraine’s mili-
tary posture has always been purely 
defensive, and, unlike Russia, Ukraine 
has up held its commitments under the 
Minsk agreements, which were de-
signed to ensure a ceasefire in Eastern 
Ukraine in the Donbas region. 
NATO, of course, is a defensive alli-
ance and is no threat to Russian terri-
torial 
integrity. 
NATO’s 
Secretary 
General Jens Stoltenberg recently told 
reporters that the ‘‘significant move-
ment’’ of Russian troops into Ukraine’s 
neighbor, Belarus, is the ‘‘biggest Rus-
sian deployment there since the Cold 
War.’’ And Russian troop numbers in 
Belarus are likely to climb to 30,000, 
with the backing of special forces, ad-
vanced fighter jets, short-range bal-
listic missiles, and S–400 ground-to-air 
missile defense systems. This is new. 
By the way, Ukraine is not asking for 
us to fight these wars for them. They 
have been in a war with Russia over 
the past 8 years. They have lost over 
14,000 Ukrainians to this battle, includ-
ing at the line of contact, where there 
has been a hot conflict. I have been to 
the line of contact. I have seen it. I 
have seen where the Russian snipers 
have killed Ukrainian soldiers. I have 
talked to the soldiers from Ukraine, 
who are determined, committed, and 
patriotic. 
Fourteen thousand people—if you 
compare the population of Ukraine to 
our population here in the United 
States of America, that would be the 
equivalent of us losing about 120,000 
Americans over the past 8 years to an 
enemy. That is more people than we 
lost in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Af-
ghanistan combined. Think how we 
would feel. This is how the Ukrainians 
feel. 
Ukraine is not asking, again, for us 
to fight their war for them, but they 
are asking for increased lethal military 
assistance to help defend themselves 
should Russia make a big mistake and 
decide to invade further into Ukraine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S579 
February 8, 2022 
When it comes to our allies, I have 
been pleased that most have really 
stepped up to help Ukraine during this 
crisis. The British have provided anti- 
tank missiles. When I was in Ukraine 
recently with the congressional delega-
tion, as we left the airport—this was 
about 3 weeks ago—a cargo plane ar-
rived—an 
American-made 
cargo 
plane—with weapons from the U.K. The 
United Kingdom was providing anti- 
tank weapons to Ukraine. I saw them 
being unloaded, and I saw the smiles on 
the faces of the Ukrainians knowing 
that this will give them a better 
chance to defend themselves. We appre-
ciate the Brits. 
The Canadians have helped, specifi-
cally 
recently 
providing 
important 
training on some of the new equipment 
they are getting. The Danes have 
helped with additional funding, and the 
Baltics have transferred weapons as 
well. Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania 
have all been strongly supportive. Po-
land has been so supportive—and so 
many others. 
We need all of our allies to step up 
like that—certainly all of our NATO 
allies but, really, all freedom-loving 
countries around the world. This is 
where the cause of freedom is being 
fought right now. 
My hope is that Congress can come 
together and speak with one voice—Re-
publicans and Democrats alike—pass 
bipartisan sanctions legislation and an 
aid package that sends a strong mes-
sage of support to the Ukrainian peo-
ple, a message that we stand with them 
in their fight for freedom but also 
sends a strong message to Russia that, 
if they choose to invade further, the 
armed conflict will carry a heavy cost, 
the sanctions will be devastating—and, 
finally, legislation that sends a strong 
message to the world that the United 
States stands with its allies in Eastern 
Europe and throughout freedom-loving 
countries across the world. 
The time to speak is now, with one 
voice. The world is listening and 
watching. 
f 
JOHN H. LEAHR AND HERBERT M. 
HEILBRUN POST OFFICE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
pleased to come to the Senate floor 
today to speak in support of a bill 
sponsored by the entire Ohio delega-
tion 
naming 
the 
post 
office 
in 
Avondale—of Cincinnati, OH—for two 
World War II aviators: John Leahr and 
Herbert Heilbrun. 
These 
two 
remarkable 
men—one 
Black and one White—grew up in 
Avondale, which is a neighborhood 
which is part of Cincinnati, OH. They 
dreamed of flying and signed up for the 
Army Air Corps after Pearl Harbor. 
John Leahr flew the P–51 Mustang with 
the 
Tuskegee 
Airmen, 
and 
Herb 
Heilbrun flew the B–17 bomber. 
The Tuskegee fighters were assigned 
to protect the bombers in the European 
theater. John and Herb worked to-
gether on some of the same missions, 
but as World War II airmen, they were 
segregated and did not interact. They 
didn’t get to know each other until 
more than 50 years after the war ended. 
In 1997, Herb Heilbrun discovered 
that an event for the Tuskegee Airmen 
was going to be held in downtown Cin-
cinnati. He decided to stop by and 
thank the fighter pilots who helped 
protect him and his bomber and his 
bomber squad in Europe. 
There, Herb met John Leahr, and the 
two men hit it off and discovered how 
much they had in common. They found 
out 
they 
had 
both 
grown 
up 
in 
Avondale and both spent time waiting 
for training working at the same en-
gine plant: Wright Aeronautical in 
Lockland, OH. They realized they had 
been in the same third grade class at 
North Avondale Elementary School. 
Luckily, Herb had saved the class pic-
ture; and there, you can see them 
standing right next to each other, John 
and Herb. 
Their friendship was obviously meant 
to be. John Leahr had long wanted to 
make sure people knew about the 
Tuskegee Airmen and their contribu-
tions during the war. Together, John 
and Herb shared their story with 
schoolchildren 
and 
adults, 
talking 
about how things were different in the 
past 
and 
promoting 
racial 
under-
standing and the rejection of bigotry 
today. 
Here they are with a group of young 
people, Herb and John, with models of 
the airplanes that they flew. 
The Harvard Foundation for Intercul-
tural and Race Relations honored them 
for their work in 2003, and in 2007, there 
was a book—‘‘Black and White Airmen: 
Their True History’’—and it recounts 
their story. 
John died in 2015 at the age of 94. 
Herb died in 2020 at 100 years old. 
I believe naming this post office in 
their neighborhood for John Leahr and 
Herb Heilbrun is a fitting way to honor 
the memory of this team, who served 
our country with bravery and distinc-
tion in World War II but then contin-
ued an important part of their public 
service long after their military serv-
ice ended. 
My hope is that this legislation will 
be passed by the Senate on a bipartisan 
basis and we can name this post office 
after these two remarkable men. 
(Ms. HASSAN assumed the Chair.)

TRIBUTE TO ANGIE YOUNGEN 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, fi-
nally, I want to acknowledge someone 
who is in the Chamber tonight. I want 
to acknowledge her dedicated service. 
This is one of my senior staff members, 
who is moving to Richmond, VA, to 
join the new Virginia Governor’s ad-
ministration. 
Angie Youngen is an Ohio native and 
an Ashland University graduate—who 
is very proud of that—and who was the 
scheduler for my predecessor, Senator 
George Voinovich. I have had the good 
fortune of having her on my team. Her 
loyalty, hard work, and judgment over 
the past 8 years is deeply appreciated. 
So, Angie Youngen, we will miss you 
here on Capitol Hill, but best of luck in 
your new adventure. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING 
NATIONAL 
COURT 
REPORTING 
AND 
CAPTIONING 
WEEK, 2022 
HON. RODNEY DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the impor-
tant and irreplaceable work done by our court 
reporters and the National Court Reporters 
Association (NCRA) during National Court Re-
porting and Captioning Week February 5–12, 
2022. 
As guardians of the Record, Court reporters 
hold the great responsibility of capturing our 
history for posterity. Throughout our Nation’s 
250 years of existence, court reporters have 
been the cornerstone of our American justice 
system. From the great speeches of our 
Founding Fathers to the eloquently orated 
speeches of Lincoln and Kennedy, these 
noble servants have transcribed some of the 
most important pieces of American history. 
Currently, the NCRA provides a free course 
to introduce real-time writing to all Americans. 
This course allows high schoolers, career 
changers, college redirects, and military vet-
erans to see if a profession in real-time writing 
is the right career choice for them. 
It has always been an honor and a privilege 
to support the NCRA. Last year, I was proud 
to co-sponsor H.R. 4652, the Training for 
Realtime Writers Act. This bill will establish a 
grant program that will support and increase 
training 
for 
court 
reporters 
and 
closed 
captioners, I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation and I look forward to continuing 
to work to get this bill passed. 
I want to thank real-time writers everywhere 
and the NCRA for all the hard work they do.

A RUSH TO GREATNESS, IN 
MEMORY OF RUSH LIMBAUGH 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor a great American and pioneer from The 
Show Me State our beloved Missouri, who 
changed the world of radio broadcasting In His 
Rush To Greatness. I ask that this poem 
penned in his honor by Albert Carey Caswell 
be included in the RECORD. 
A RUSH TO GREATNESS 
By Albert Carey Caswell 
When our last days are done and seen our 
final suns 
What have we left behind begun? 
Is it light or darkness our true sum? 
Did we make a difference with it all? 
Did we take the path less traveled answering 
the call? 
Few will etch the sands of time, 
up to the heights of Mount Rushmore climb 
Like Mark Twain creating a new paradigm 
When, all seemed lost came rushing in, 
for the forgotten all in his magnificent 
rhymes 
His golden voice touching hearts and minds 
Schooling us from your Limbaugh institute 
The Voice of Truth 
Building a case none could refute 
With Mr. Snerdly in awe at his magic pro-
duced 
Visions of the future, 
from the past brick by brick a wall of proof 
Coming out of the darkness to bring his light 
Use your talent on loan from God to shine 
your light 
At an early age a normal path to success dis-
obeyed 
Deep down inside his heart cried out the 
course to stay 
Dropping out of college his parents couldn’t 
dissuade 
In Rock and Roll he dug the beat, 
his soul longing for something much more 
deep 
Filling American’s void creating a GOLD 
RUSH in hearts to keep 
America began to fade as you Rushed in with 
the answers to save 
The bedrock principals our framers The Con-
stitution and Bill of Rights made 
Things like God, Mom, County, The Flag, 
be proud to be an American don’t ask why 
Mega Dittos, ‘‘It’s The American Way’’ 
Bringing your QUANTUM FORCE to social-
ism slay 
To look to America’s heroes like King, Wash-
ington, Kennedy, Lincoln, Dole, Bush, 
Reagan, Parks, MacArthur for a better 
day 
Like ‘‘The Gift of Hope’’ Bob, 
and The Measure Of The Man Bob Dole his 
character on display 
When children called in you felt his heart 
blush in every way 
For your bravado on their air, 
off one of the most humble men standing 
there 
When no one was looking for his fellow 
human being so cared 
So many stories of helping others with our 
Lord will share 
America has lost a greatest champion of 
freedom here 
The fourth column of truth is weaken for 
freedoms everywhere 
Who to slay socialism dared 
Tonight as your loved ones lay their heads 
down to rest 
Comes a gentle rain across Missouri, Florida 
our Nation to bless 
Our Lord’s tears up in Heaven to help you 
rest 
Until, your lovely wife Catherine and family 
meet again when they crest 
And you won’t have to cry no more 
Rush’s is an angel now, 
You will hear him on the wind 
When, you wake feel you’ll feel him where 
he’s been 
Watching over you time and again 
Rush there are talk shows in heaven my 
friend

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
ACHIEVE-
MENTS OF MS. BEATRICE BYRD 
HON. NYDIA M. VELA´ZQUEZ 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life achievements of Ms. Beatrice 
Byrd, in celebration of her 80th Birthday. Born 
February 3, 1942, Ms. Byrd, has served as a 
selfless and celebrated advocate to her com-
munity of Red Hook, Brooklyn. 
As a public servant, Ms. Byrd ran for City 
Council to represent her community and the 
surrounding area in 1991. She has also been 
elected to serve as the Resident Association 
President of Red Hook Houses West. In her 
appointment as a NYCHA Board member, she 
was an outspoken voice for tenant rights and 
ensured that her neighbors received equal op-
portunities, resources, and access to upward 
mobility. 
In her tenure as an educator, Ms. Byrd was 
a well-respected NYC Public School teacher 
during the most formative years of a child. 
She continues to remain a recognized role 
model in and around the community of Red 
Hook. 
In her role of extended community service, 
she held the prestigious honor as the Presi-
dent to the Brooklyn Branch of the National 
Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People (NAACP), was a member to the Lions 
Club of Red Hook and served on Area Policy 
Board 6. Currently Ms. Byrd continues to rep-
resent Red Hook as a board member to the 
Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center. 
As displayed by her decades of community 
service, Ms. Beatrice Byrd remains a solid pil-
lar of the Red Hook community. She is well 
respected by generations of her students, 
neighbors, community professionals and the 
local clergy. Through her life-long actions she 
has instilled the core values of ethics, public 
service and civic pride. 
I thank Ms. Byrd for her public service and 
Happy 80th Birthday.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO AL LIBASCI 
HON. LLOYD SMUCKER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to Mr. Al Libasci of York, 
Pennsylvania, a World War II veteran who will 
be turning 102 years old on February 25, 
2022. Al’s life has been one of service to our 
country. Drafted into the U.S. Army in 1942, Al 
served in the Pacific Theater during World 
War II with the Jolly Rogers, 90th Heavy 
Bomb Group, 5th Air Force. Al flew over thirty 
combat missions in a B–24 Liberator, bravely 
serving our country overseas. After the War, 
Al went on to work as a civilian employee for 
the government, helping the military to acquire 
land for some of its installations, including the 
land on which the United States Air Force 
Academy now sits. Al’s life has been marked 
by so much more than his career and service, 
however. He is a father, a husband, a bowling 
enthusiast, and a friend to many who has 
touched the lives of people around him with 
his positivity and enthusiasm. 
Al’s life has been an extraordinary one and 
I wish him, his family, and his wife, Rosina, 
the happiest of birthdays as he celebrates his 
102nd.

IN RECOGNITION OF BETSY LAW-
RENCE AND HER SERVICE TO 
THE 
HOUSE 
JUDICIARY 
COM-
MITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise, along 
with ZOE LOFGREN, Chair of the Subcommittee 
on Immigration and Citizenship, to thank Betsy 
Lawrence for her service to the House Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
Betsy came to the Committee as part of a 
distinguished career working to advance the 
rights of immigrants and their families. She 
had previously worked for more than a decade 
at the American Immigration Lawyers Associa-
tion, where she held several different posi-
tions, including Associate Director of Edu-
cation, Associate Director of Liaison, and Di-
rector of Government Relations. Before joining 
AILA, Betsy was an associate attorney at Van 
Der Hout LLP. She earned her B.S. from 
Northeastern University and her J.D. from the 
University of San Francisco School of Law. 
Betsy joined the Committee on the Judiciary 
as Counsel to our Subcommittee on Immigra-
tion and Citizenship in February 2019—an es-
pecially busy time as we prepared to advance 
a robust immigration reform agenda and con-
duct meaningful oversight of the Trump Ad-
ministration’s anti-immigrant policies. Betsy 
quickly proved herself to be an invaluable 
member of our immigration team, and we 
were pleased to promote her to Chief Counsel 
of our Immigration Subcommittee at the begin-
ning of this Congress. 
During her tenure here, Betsy played a piv-
otal role in ensuring House passage of numer-
ous bills to provide for a more humane and 
just immigration system, including the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act, the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act, the National Origin- 
Based Antidiscrimination for Nonimmigrants 
(NO BAN) Act, and the Access to Counsel 
Act. She was also heavily involved in our in-
vestigation into the Trump Administration’s 
‘‘zero tolerance’’ or family separation policy, 
our efforts to include meaningful immigration 
reform in the reconciliation process, and our 
work to ensure immigration provisions were in-
cluded in the America COMPETES Act of 
2022. Despite our polarized political climate, 
Betsy and her team successfully worked to 
pass several bills into law, including the Citi-
zenship for Children of Military Members and 
Civil Servants Act and the HOPE (Honoring 
Our Promises through Expedition) for Afghan 
SIVs Act of 2021. The Committee is deeply 
proud of her record of accomplishment. 
The country has been fortunate to have 
Betsy working hard within the halls of Con-
gress to reform our broken immigration sys-
tem, undo the harms caused by the last ad-
ministration, 
and 
ensure 
the 
expedient 
issuance of special immigrant visas to those 
who served side by side with American troops 
in Afghanistan. Although we will miss her 
greatly, we know she will continue to make 
her country proud as she transitions to her 
new role in the Biden-Harris Administration. 
We thank Betsy for her service to the Com-
mittee and wish her the best of luck with this 
new chapter.

HONORING THE EXTRAORDINARY 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
OF 
CACHAVIOUS ‘‘CHAY’’ ENGLISH 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the extraordinary accomplishments of 
Cachavious ‘‘Chay’’ English, my beloved 
former Chief of Staff, and key advisors; Chay 
joined our staff as a legislative assistant in 
January of 2011 and served his home district 
with distinction for almost ten years. In No-
vember of last year, Chay took on a new role 
at BGR Group, a primer bipartisan lobbying, 
and public relations firm, as a vice president 
where he will be focusing on financial serv-
ices, tax, and health care policies. 
Chay received his education from the Uni-
versity of Michigan, where he served as a res-
idential advisor before receiving his Bachelor 
of Arts in African and African American Stud-
ies. At the University of Michigan, Chay be-
came a member of his esteemed fraternity, 
Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., a brotherhood 
that has provided him an invaluable network 
for years to come. He then continued his edu-
cation at the University of Alabama School of 
Law, where he graduated with a 3.0. It was 
here where he began setting the foundation 
for his promising career in politics as a mem-
ber of the Trial Advocacy Competition Team 
that would go on to become national cham-
pions in 2009 through 2010. As an active stu-
dent at the University of Alabama, Chay was 
also a member of the Order of Barristers Hon-
ors Society and the National Black Law Stu-
dents Association. 
Professionally while working as a legal in-
tern for the National Labor Board Field Office 
and former Alabama 7th Congressional District 
Representative Congressman Artur David in 
2009 and 2010, Chay continued to expand his 
knowledge of politics by performing statutory 
research and analysis on proposed legislation 
concerning Displaced Citizens’ Voting Rights, 
the Elder Justice Act, Military Internet Voting, 
and Gulf Coast Reconstruction. Chay joined 
our office in 2011 and served as a Legislative 
Assistant serving as an interim primary policy 
advisor for all proposed legislative initiatives, 
policy recommendations, and recorded votes. 
Devoting his considerable talents to ensuring 
the progression of Alabama’s 7th Congres-
sional District, he quickly became the primary 
counsel for legislative initiatives and policy 
recommendations pertaining to financial serv-
ices, small business, agriculture, housing, 
workforce development, and labor issues.

February 8, 2022 
In 2013, Chay then became one of the lead 
lobbyists for the American Association for Jus-
tice as a part of the Federal Relations Coun-
sel. Here, he led and managed advocacy ef-
forts, managed complex legislative projects, 
and directly advocated civil justice issues in-
cluding, intellectual property rights, national 
security, transportation safety, and consumer 
protection. 
Returning to serve his home district in 2015, 
Chay returned to our office, where he served 
as Legislative Director, then a dynamic Chief 
of Staff until 2020. Here he brought his same 
hardworking attitude and political astuteness 
to expand and uplift Alabama’s 7th Congres-
sional District. He was not only a valued mem-
ber of my staff but as a fellow native of Selma, 
Alabama Chay’s success continues to be cele-
brated throughout my district. Chay serves as 
the embodiment of what residents from the 
Black Belt can accomplish when given the op-
portunity. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the remarkable accomplishments of 
Cachavious English, a true servant leader 
whose achievements have inspired a genera-
tion of future trailblazers from across the Black 
Belt.

BACK THE BLUE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 7, 2022 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the opportunity to express my heartfelt 
appreciation for our law enforcement officers. 
The men and women in blue who keep our 
streets safe are heroes. Every day when they 
put on their uniform, they do so mindful that 
they may be called upon to put themselves in 
harm’s way. By stepping forward and self-
lessly protecting us, they make everything else 
possible. The recent violence against our po-
lice officers is a stark reminder of the dangers 
of the job. 
On May 31, 2021, Sergeant Dominic Vaca 
of the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Depart-
ment was killed in the line of duty. Sgt. Vaca 
spent 17 years protecting the Inland Empire 
and died a hero. He is just one of 346 officers 
who was shot in the line of duty in 2021. 
Homicide rates in California rose 17 percent 
last year—on top of a 31 percent rise in 2020. 
I believe these increases can be in large part 
attributed to radical calls to defund our police 
and Democrats’ soft on crime rhetoric. 
Thankfully, most Americans see our officers 
for the agents of good that they are. In left- 
leaning states, however, like California, Demo-
crats have enacted laws that actually make it 
more difficult for our law enforcement officers 
to do their job. This is wrong. This is dan-
gerous. 
I specifically would like to thank those that 
keep my community safe. Sheriff Chad 
Bianco; the Riverside County Sheriffs Depart-
ment who serve our county and contract cities; 
as well as the officers of the Corona, Menifee, 
and Murrieta Police Departments; and all 
those who serve Riverside County and across 
the Inland Empire. I thank them for the self-
less and heroic work they do. 
I stand fully behind our law enforcement offi-
cers and will continue to vote for policies that 
support public safety. We can never repay the 
men and women who wear the uniform and 
keep our loved ones safe. But we can—and 
we should—always have their back.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
MENTORING MONTH 
HON. GUS M. BILIRAKIS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of National Mentoring 
Month. 
January 2022 marked the 20th anniversary 
of National Mentoring Month, an annual cam-
paign to focus attention on the need for men-
tors, as well as how each of us can work to-
gether to increase the number of mentors to 
help ensure positive outcomes for our young 
people. 
Mentoring programs across the country 
make our communities stronger by driving 
impactful relationships that increase social 
capital for young people and provide invalu-
able support networks. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, mentoring 
programs have stepped up to fill gaps for 
young people and families, connecting them 
with resources and ensuring that mentoring re-
lationships continue virtually to ensure that 
physical distancing does not mean social dis-
connection. 
Mentoring plays a pivotal role in career ex-
ploration and supports workplace skills by 
helping young people set career goals, equip-
ping mentors with the skills needed to support 
the professional growth of young people, and 
drives positive outcomes for young people and 
businesses. 
Quality 
mentoring 
promotes 
healthy relationships and communication, posi-
tive self-esteem, emotional well-being, and 
growth of a young person and their relation-
ships with other adults. 
Students who meet regularly with their men-
tors are 52 percent less likely than their peers 
to skip a day of school and youth who face an 
opportunity gap, but have a mentor, are 55 
percent more likely to be enrolled in college 
than those who did not have a mentor. Youth 
who meet regularly with their mentors are 46 
percent less likely than their peers to start 
using drugs and 27 percent less likely to start 
drinking. 
National Mentoring Month is the time of year 
to celebrate, elevate, and encourage men-
toring across our country and recruit caring 
adult mentors. I encourage all of my col-
leagues to join me in this celebration and 
thank those individuals who are willing to step 
up and help shape the next generation of 
young Americans.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY 
OF 
HYATTSVILLE 
MAYOR KEVIN WARD 
HON. STENY H. HOYER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the life and legacy of Mayor 
Kevin Ward. The Hyattsville community lost a 
trusted leader and a strong advocate when 
Kevin tragically lost his life to suicide on Janu-
ary 22. He was just forty-four years old and 
left behind a husband, two sons, and a grand-
son. His loss is deeply felt across the commu-
nity and throughout Prince George’s County in 
my district, and the outpouring of grief is a tes-
tament to the impact he left on so many. 
There was no one more willing to lend an ear 
to a neighbor or to do whatever it took to 
change someone’s life for the better in the 
community to which he gave so much of his 
energy, talent, and love. 
Kevin saw Hyattsville as ‘the jewel in the 
crown of Prince George’s County,’ and he 
dedicated himself to making that jewel shine 
brighter. In 2015, Kevin was elected to the Hy-
attsville City Council, and during his tenure as 
a Council member and later as Council Presi-
dent, he promoted an inclusive agenda to help 
Hyattsville residents thrive and get ahead. He 
cosponsored legislation aimed at making Hy-
attsville more welcoming to and inclusive of 
immigrants and voted to expand the municipal 
franchise to include non-citizen residents. 
Under his leadership, Hyattsville experienced 
unprecedented economic growth with the ex-
pansion of the Gateway Arts District and cre-
ation of new housing. 
In 2020, Kevin became Interim Mayor and 
was elected to a full term last May. As Hyatts-
ville’s first openly gay and second Black 
mayor, Kevin was a trailblazer not only in rep-
resentation but in the boldness of his vision. 
During his time in office, he was a champion 
for youth, affordable housing, and sustain-
ability efforts. He worked zealously to help 
residents throughout the pandemic, partnering 
with the First United Methodist Church of Hy-
attsville to set up vaccination clinics and food 
distribution for those in need. 
Kevin was more than an exemplary public 
servant: he was a devoted father, grandfather, 
and husband. His love for his husband Chad, 
his sons Sydney and Norman, and his grand-
son Elijah inspired him to work for a better fu-
ture for them and all who shared their commu-
nity. I offer my deepest condolences to Kevin’s 
family, friends, and neighbors, who will surely 
be reflecting on his legacy for a long time to 
come and who have already been an enor-
mous support to Chad, their sons, and their 
grandson during this very difficult time. 
Through the darkness of this moment, surely 
Kevin’s memory will be the inspiring light to 
guide the community forward into brighter 
days to come. I hope all of my colleagues will 
join me in remembering Kevin Ward and his 
life of service, passion, and love for his com-
munity. 
The rise in suicide among Black Americans 
is a challenge we as a nation cannot ignore. 
The pandemic has exacerbated mental health 
struggles for millions of Americans, and it is 
essential that we all do our part to reach out 
and help others who may be in need of assist-
ance. I urge anyone struggling with grief or 
mental health challenges to reach out and 
seek support from the many resources avail-
able, including the National Suicide Hotline at 
(800) 273–8255.

HONORING DAVE LENTELL AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Dave Lentell as Iowan of the Week. 
Dave is the Lead Lender Relations Specialist 
at the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
Iowa District office. Dave lives in Waukee, and 
through his almost 29 years with the Iowa 
SBA he held countless conversations con-
necting with small business owners throughout 
Iowa and across the 3rd District. I’m glad to 
take this opportunity to recognize Dave for his 
dedicated public service for Iowa’s small busi-
nesses over the course of his career. 
Dave first joined the Iowa SBA in 1993 for 
an internship while studying at Drake Univer-
sity. Quickly after starting his work, the Great 
Flood of 1993 happened, and Dave stepped 
up and took an outsized role in facilitating dis-
aster relief information. Dave was offered full- 
time work after graduating college and has re-
mained with the Iowa SBA since then. Over 
that period, Dave has helped other businesses 
and homeowners through periodic disaster 
events—while also offering technical support 
and advice to businesses seeking to break-
through. Dave most appreciates the ability to 
connect with business owners and lenders to 
identify paths forward for Iowa’s small busi-
ness economy—which includes over 273,000 
small businesses. 
Since COVID–19 began, Dave has once 
again stepped up as he did in 1993—but in 
this case, the pandemic affected every small 
business in Iowa. With SBA charged to admin-
ister disaster relief programs such as Eco-
nomic Impact Disaster Loans (EIDL) and the 
Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Dave’s 
engagement with the business and lending 
community increased. Through collaboration 
with businesses directly, and associated orga-
nizations and groups, Dave worked hard to 
ensure 
that 
information 
was 
distributed 
throughout the Iowa community and has 
earned the respect of his SBA colleagues, 
who nominated him to my office for recogni-
tion. 
While we all seek a general return to nor-
malcy, Dave relates that business models 
have changed during the pandemic—and in 
many cases that change is here to stay. While 
the role of SBA may see changes in the fu-
ture, Dave’s service over the past 28 years 
has certainly been welcome help for our Dis-
trict. I am glad to honor Dave Lentell as Iowan 
of the Week.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 170TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF OX-
FORD 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 170th Anniversary 
of the City of Oxford. 
A part of Alabama’s Third Congressional 
District, Oxford, is located in Calhoun County. 
The 
Muscogee 
Creek 
Nation 
called 
Choccolocco Valley home for 12,000 years. In 
1540, Hernando DeSoto crossed the region on 
behalf of Spain in search of riches. France 
claimed the lands in 1699 after successfully 
establishing settlements at Mobile, New Orle-
ans and Biloxi. Even though France controlled 
the area that would later become Oxford, it 
was still inhabited by the Creek Nation. Eng-
land gained possession after the signing of the 
Treaty of Paris at the end of the Seven Years 
War. In 1789, the entire northern portion of 
Alabama was owned by Georgia. The lands 
were given to the federal government in 1802 
as part of the Mississippi Territory. 
Alabama was admitted to the Union on De-
cember 14, 1819. Benton County was incor-
porated on December 18, 1832, and included 
present-day Calhoun, Cleburne and portions 
of Cherokee and Talladega Counties. At the 
time of incorporation, the only incorporated 
towns in Benton County were Jacksonville and 
White Plains. In the early 1830s, the Snow 
and Simmons families were two of the first Eu-
ropean descent families to settle among the 
Creek natives. Snow owned the land south of 
present-day Choccolocco Street, and Sim-
mons owned the land north. An early legend 
recalls the area south was called ‘‘Skace 
Grease’’ and the area north ‘‘Lick Skillet.’’ 
Local folklore says a traveler was passing 
through and needed a place for rest and food. 
As he was visiting, he was directed to ‘‘lick the 
skillet’’ because they were ‘‘skace of grease.’’ 
Oxford was established on February 7, 
1852, the bill proposed by Representative 
Matthew Allen of Benton County. The limits of 
the town included one square mile from the 
center at the male academy on Second Street. 
Elisha S. Simmons, Edmund P. Gains, John 
A. Turnipseed, Stephen C. Williams, and 
Woodson Seay were authorized to run on a 
ballot for the election of three council mem-
bers and an intendant (mayor). It was decided 
that on the first Saturday of each March, an-
nual municipal elections would be held for of-
fices of council and mayor. 
On February 21, 1860, Oxford was char-
tered for the second time due to redrawing of 
boundary lines and the changing of the name 
of Benton County to Calhoun County. The lim-
its of the town included a half-mile in each di-
rection from the railroad culvert at Spring 
Street. Elections were to be held on the first 
Monday of each March annually. In this incor-
poration, the law called for the election of 
seven councilmembers and an intendant. The 
councilmembers and intendant were given the 
power to elect a marshal, clerk and treasurer. 
Those who have served as mayor of Oxford, 
respectively, include Elisha S. Simmons, Dr. 
Stephen C. Williams, Samuel C. Kelly, James 
S. Kelly, Edgar H. Hanna, Charles T. Hilton, 
William J. Borden, John B. McCain, Dr. Thom-
as C. Hill, Robert P. Thomason, William H. 
Griffin, John N. Gunnels, Thomas A. Howle, 
Maj. William A. Orr, George W. Eichelberger, 
William C. Gray, Dreadzil P. Haynes, Asa C. 
Allen, William R. Norton, Davis C. Cooper, 
Robert R. Pope, Dr. Thomas B. Howle, Carl 
D. Pace, Hemphill G. Whiteside, Alvis A. 
Hamric, Bester A. Adams, Earl R. Martin, 
Therman E. Whitmore, Leon Smith, and Alton 
Craft. 
The Oxford Police Department was estab-
lished at the time of the first incorporation. 
However, the earliest police force only in-
cluded one town marshal. The first recorded 
marshal for Oxford was Francis M. Gardner, 
who served in the early 1880s. The Oxford 
Fire Department was organized on May 18, 
1884, as a volunteer department. Major Wil-
liam A. Orr served as the first chief. 
In 1904, the citizens of Oxford were con-
vinced that the town needed a permanent city 
hall for the purposes of conducting municipal 
business. In September of that year, it was 
decided city hall would be located in a building 
on Main Street and the fire department would 
share the building. An armory was established 
adjacent to the building for the Calhoun Rifles. 
The calaboose was located several yards 
south on Spring Street. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing 
Oxford a happy 170th anniversary.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 2, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I want to com-
mend the authors of the America COMPETES 
Act of 2022 for including $52 billion to 
incentivize private-sector investments and con-
tinued American leadership in semiconductor 
manufacturing to help address supply chain 
disruptions and ensure that more semiconduc-
tors are produced here at home. 
Within my central Florida district is the 
NeoCity technology campus which is recog-
nized as an emerging microelectronics and 
advanced manufacturing hub, that has already 
made synergies with institutions of higher edu-
cation across Florida and key partnerships 
with the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. 
Department of Commerce. NeoCity is home to 
BRIDG, a not-for-profit, public-private partner-
ship specializing in domestic semiconductor 
research, development, and manufacturing. 
Imec, a world-renowned international research 
and development organization active in semi-
conductor design and architecture. SUSS 
MicroTec, a leading supplier of equipment and 
process solutions for the semiconductor indus-
try. And SkyWater Technology, the only U.S. 
owned and operated pure play trusted found-
ry, that works on leading-edge advanced 
packaging technology. They all work in col-
laboration out of the Center for Neovation, one 
of the most state-of-the-art advanced manu-
facturing facilities in the western hemisphere. 
As envisioned by this important legislation, the 
facilities, and experts at BRIDG, imec, SUSS 
MicroTec, and SkyWaterTechnology offer im-
mediate capability to accelerate U.S. produc-
tion of critical semiconductor chips, strengthen 
the domestic supply chain so chips are made 
in America, and turbocharge our research ca-
pacity. Equally as important, the NeoCity 
Academy, a public STEM magnet high school, 
is training the leaders of tomorrow’s science 
and technology workforce. 
I am proud of the work being undertaken in 
my district to support domestic semiconductor 
manufacturing technology development as 
they work to address the supply chain. I look 
forward to working with the Administration and 
the U.S. Department of Commerce on imple-
mentation of the American Competes Act and 
the CHIPS for America Fund.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E127 
February 8, 2022 
I appreciate the inclusion of three amend-
ments for consideration in the final passage of 
the COMPETES Act: 
CHIPS Funding to Non-Profits: Adds non-
profits to the definition of ‘‘covered entities’’ to 
expand the semiconductor incentive program 
to include nonprofit entities. This clarifies that 
non-profit entities like the 501(c) facilities in 
NeoCity are also eligible for funding under the 
semiconductor incentive program. 
AI JOBS Amendment (H.R. 6553): Directs 
the Department of Labor to create a report 
analyzing the future of artificial intelligence 
and its impact on the American Workforce. 
Specifically, the report would collect data to 
analyze which industries are protected to have 
the most growth through artificial intelligence, 
and the demographics which may experience 
expanded career opportunities and those most 
vulnerable to job displacement. This is an in-
clusion of the standalone bill H.R. 6553, the AI 
JOBS Act. 
Blockchain & Crypto Specialist w/in OSTP: 
Requires the Director of the Office of Science 
and 
Technology 
Policy 
to 
establish 
a 
blockchain and cryptocurrencies advisory spe-
cialist position within the Office to advise the 
President on matters related to blockchain and 
cryptocurrencies. OSTP advises the President 
and others within the Executive Office of the 
President on the scientific, engineering, and 
technological aspects of the economy, national 
security, homeland security, health, foreign re-
lations, and the environment. it is critical to 
create such a position within OSTP to ensure 
there is a policy expert capable of advising the 
President and others within the Executive Of-
fice on these issues of growing national impor-
tance. 
The Restoring Resilient Reefs Act (RRRA) 
reauthorizes the Coral Reef Conservation Act 
(CRCA), which expired nearly fifteen years 
ago. It maintains the NOAA Coral Reef pro-
gram, while also introducing overdue improve-
ments to coral management and restoration 
efforts and giving innovative new tools to part-
ners who are closest to this crisis: states, terri-
tories, tribes, communities, and universities. 
KEY PROVISIONS. 
A 5-year authorization with an explicit focus 
on restoration activities where natural disas-
ters and human actives have degraded reef 
ecosystems. This program is currently funded 
at $33M for 2021 but without further direction 
by Congress. 
Creates a block grant program where states 
and territories can receive federal ‘‘matching 
funds’’ for the prior year’s coral expenditures, 
provided they have an action plan in place, 
which will incentivize increased state and local 
investment of in coral reef management ca-
pacity. 
Intergovernmental partnerships are key for 
water infrastructure upgrades, pollution mitiga-
tion efforts and regrowing reefs, 
Allows for the formation of a public-private 
partnerships for coral management, called 
‘‘Coral Stewardship Partnerships.’’ 
Public-Private partnerships are critical for 
sharing researching. 
Authorizes the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force, 
to ensure states, territories, and other stake-
holders continue to have a voice in U.S coral 
reef management. Public feedback is essen-
tial. 
Establishes of a single streamlined set of 
guidelines for ‘‘action plans’’ to implement the 
national strategy, with maximum flexibility 
given to state and local authorities. These ac-
tion plans will focus restoration efforts more 
effectively. 
Allows for emergency grants and emer-
gency funds for coral disasters. This will assist 
with Hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, as well 
as oil spills and other major pollution events.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BERT AARON 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Bertram Donald Aaron. 
Known by friends and loved ones as Bert, Mr. 
Aaron was a staple in the Hampton Roads 
area and leaves a long-lasting impact on our 
community. 
Born in 1922 in Newport News, Bert was 
the eldest son of Harry and Lillian Aaron. He 
attained the rank of Captain in the U.S. Army 
in the Pacific theater during World War II. Fol-
lowing the war, Bert worked as an Aero-
nautical Research Scientist at the National Ad-
visory Committee for Aeronautics, now NASA. 
He then worked as an engineer for the U.S. 
Army Signal Corps where he received the 
Commanders Medal for his service to national 
defense. 
Named Daily Press Citizen of the Year for 
his support of local charities and the Virginia 
Symphony, Bert’s lasting contributions to our 
community are a testament to his enduring 
passion for the performing arts. He worked 
tirelessly to maintain the Greater Williamsburg 
Virginia Symphony Society, serving on the 
Board of the Symphony for 25 years and 
chairing the Williamsburg Area Arts Commis-
sion. Additionally, Bert was a fierce advocate 
for breast cancer research, organizing and 
chairing the first Virginia Breast Cancer Foun-
dation Symposium on state-of-the-art medicine 
for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
I am grateful for Bert’s philanthropic spirit 
and his outstanding contributions to our com-
munity. It saddens me to hear of Bert’s pass-
ing, and I send my deepest condolences to his 
family and friends.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDGAR 
STUART CAHN 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in celebrating the life of Dr. Edgar Stuart 
Cahn, who passed away at 86 years of age 
on January 23, 2022, in Bethesda, Maryland. 
Edgar Stuart Cahn was born on March 23, 
1935, and was raised in an activist household 
in New York. While earning his undergraduate 
degree at Swarthmore College, Edgar met and 
fell in love with fellow student Jean Camper, 
forming a partnership that would eventually 
spur substantial social, political and legal 
change for the benefit of our country’s most 
vulnerable. They married in New York, be-
cause, at the time, interracial marriage was il-
legal in Jean’s home state of Maryland. 
Edgar and Jean both attended Yale Law 
School, where I met them as a fellow student. 
Following graduation, they moved to the Dis-
trict of Columbia in 1963, with Jean working 
as a legal advisor at the Department of State 
and Edgar as Special Assistant to and 
speechwriter for Attorney General Robert F. 
Kennedy. They would later work together in 
the Office of Economic Opportunity, where 
they, along with Sargent Shriver, established a 
first-of-its-kind federally funded program that 
provided legal aid to low-income Americans. 
This groundbreaking initiative, the predecessor 
to the Legal Services Corporation, is widely 
acknowledged as setting a blueprint for legal 
services and catalyzing what was then the 
burgeoning field of public interest law. 
Edgar next undertook a two-year campaign 
organizing Native American leaders in an ef-
fort that led to the end of the official federal 
policy of terminating Native American tribes, 
and, with his book Our Brother’s Keeper: The 
Indian in White America, a classic indictment 
of America’s treatment of Native Americans, to 
enactment of Public Law 93–638, the Indian 
Self-Determination and Education Assistance 
Act. 
Edgar and Jean founded the Antioch School 
of Law, the predecessor to the University of 
the District of Columbia David A. Clarke 
School of Law. He served as a member of the 
UDC law faculty until near the end of his life. 
Edgar was a visionary in strategies to allevi-
ate poverty, a pioneer in clinical legal edu-
cation and a dear friend. He led with an un-
wavering focus to help the most vulnerable 
among us. He was equally beloved for his 
kindness, and he will be greatly missed. 
Madam Speaker, again, I ask the House of 
Representatives to join me in honoring the in-
credible life and legacy of Dr. Edgar Stuart 
Cahn.

safety of our community. 
I am incredibly grateful for the positive im-
pact Paul has had on others throughout his 
long career of service, and I wish him count-
less blessings during his retirement.

CONGRATULATING RICHARD 
LINEBERRY ON HIS ELECTION 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Richard Lineberry of Hamilton for 
his service as State Commander of the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, Department of Indiana. 
Richard joined VFW Post 2457 in 2011 and 
has been a leader since. He has served as 
the 4th District Commander, the Indiana De-
partment Junior Vice Commander and the In-
diana Department Senior Vice Commander. 
Richard has served his community, state 
and country in several capacities beyond that 
of the VFW, as well. For nearly 34 years, he 
served in the United States Air Force Reserve/ 
National Guard. For twenty years, Richard 
served as a law enforcement officer in New 
Haven, where he held positions including dep-
uty coroner, Sergeant, SCUBA Recovery, ac-
cident reconstructionist, and firearms instruc-
tor. For 12 years, he worked at the VA hos-
pital in Fort Wayne both as a police officer 
and as a Means Test Officer where he pre-
sided over initial enrollments for veterans 
seeking benefits. 
Richard is also a proud board member of 
Honor Flight Northeast Indiana, which helps 
bring Hoosier veterans to Washington, D.C. to 
visit memorials dedicated to honor their serv-
ice and sacrifices. Remarkably, he has reg-
istered over 100 veterans for these honor 
flights, including many who served in World 
War II. 
Few men are as deserving of State Com-
mander as Richard. That’s why I’m proud to 
honor him for all the remarkable things he has 
done and the lives he has changed. This posi-
tion as State Commander has been a crown-
ing achievement of a record of service for 
which our community is most grateful.

THREAT FROM FENTANYL FLOW-
ING OVER OUR SOUTHERN BOR-
DER 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to address a catastrophic mass death in our 
country because of our open borders—all due 
to fentanyl. 
Fentanyl is freely flowing across our south-
ern border as seizures increased by nearly 
135 percent in 2021 under Joe Biden’s laxed 
immigration enforcement. 
In FY 2021, Customs and Border Protection 
seized 11,201 pounds of fentanyl, a historic 
rate that is more than all that was seized in 
2018 and 2019 combined. This amounts to 
enough fentanyl to cause 2,540,341,996 
deaths, or more than 7 times the U.S. popu-
lation. 
The free flow of this deadly drug across our 
border is a direct result of the Biden adminis-
tration’s open border policies. The fact is, Joe 
Biden continues to ignore and fails to address 
the record high overdose deaths caused from 
deadly fentanyl-related substances crossing 
our border. 
As a result, the scourge of fentanyl is de-
stroying our communities, killing our children 
and devastating our families. 
According to the Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration (DEA), U.S. overdose deaths reached 
a devastating new height in 2021, claiming a 
new victim every five minutes. 
There is a direct link between fentanyl-re-
lated overdose deaths and criminal drug car-
tels in Mexico. The ease in which the drug 
cartels operate is shocking. The cartels control 
the borders and are taking full advantage of 
Joe Biden’s weak immigration policies. 
Last December, in my home state of Ari-
zona, the Scottsdale Police Department and 
the Arizona Attorney General’s Office seized a 
record 1.7 million fentanyl pills and 10 kilo-
grams of fentanyl powder. 
During a recent two-month public safety 
surge, the DEA Phoenix Field Division an-
nounced total seizures of over three million 
fentanyl pills and 45 kilograms of fentanyl 
powder. 
Just one fentanyl pill can kill. Yet our open 
borders remain a fentanyl pipeline. 
Instead of securing our southern border to 
stop the flow of fentanyl, Mr. Biden has dou-
bled down on his open-border policies that will 
only worsen the ongoing border crisis and de-
stroy more communities and lives. 
Just because Joe Biden ignores the fentanyl 
crisis doesn’t mean Congress should. Con-
gress must address the crisis at the border. 
Congress must also take action and perma-
nently place fentanyl-related substances in 
Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. 
The emergency class-wide scheduling order 
for fentanyl-related substances is set to expire 
on February 18, 2022. 
Speaker PELOSI and the Democrats are 
wrong to allow this order to expire.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
OF 
SOUTHERN 
UNION STATE COMMUNITY COL-
LEGE 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 100th Anniversary 
of Southern Union State Community College. 
Southern Union State Community College is 
the second oldest two-year college in Ala-
bama, and is currently under the leadership of 
President Todd Shackett. 
Southern Union has compiled a rich history 
throughout the years. Originally chartered by 
the Southern Christian Convention of Con-
gregational Christian Churches, SUSCC was 
planned as a feeder school for Elon College in 
North Carolina. In 1922, 51 students stepped 
into a single building in Wadley, Alabama, that 
was then known as Bethlehem College; and 
the dream of a college in east Alabama was 
realized. 
Southern Union remained church related 
until 1964, operating as Piedmont Junior Col-
lege, Southern Union College and The South-
ern Union College. On October 1, 1964, the 
college was the first to be deeded to the State 
of Alabama to become part of the newly-cre-
ated system of two-year colleges. The name 
of the college became Southern Union State 
Junior College, and it achieved accreditation in 
1970 from the Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools. 
In response to requests from business and 
industry, Southern Union expanded its reach 
to an even wider area in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s, offering higher education opportu-
nities in Lee and Chambers counties by hold-
ing classes at local high schools. The college 
continued its commitment to the citizens of the 
area with the construction of campuses in the 
cities of Opelika and Valley. In 1974, the Val-
ley Campus was completed. And, in 1982, the 
college purchased land in Opelika and offered 
a full-range of course offerings at its Opelika 
Campus. On August 12, 1993, the college 
merged with the local technical college, thus 
expanding its technical education offerings. 
Upon merging, the college became Southern 
Union State Community College. 
Today, Southern Union has three campus 
locations in Wadley, Opelika and Valley and 
boasts an enrollment of approximately 5,000 
students. SUSCC serves residents of an eight 
county area of East and Central Alabama as

Southern Union a happy 100th anniversary.

IN RECOGNITION OF JOHN WIL-
LIAMS AND HIS SERVICE TO THE 
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
thank John Williams for his service to the 
House Committee on the Judiciary. 
John came to the Committee as merely the 
last step in a distinguished career in public 
service. He previously worked for various of-
fices on Capitol Hill, including for former Rep-
resentative Baron Hill of Indiana, the House 
Committee on Rules, the House Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, and the 
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation. He has also held positions 
at the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, the IMPAC 2000 redistricting 
project, and, most recently-before rejoining us 
on the Hill-at the Federal Communications 
Commission. John received his bachelor’s de-
gree from the University of Virginia, his Ph.D. 
from the University of Chicago, and his J.D. 
from Georgetown University Law Center. 
John joined the Committee on the Judiciary 
as Senior Counsel and Parliamentarian in No-
vember 2019, as the House was in the midst 
of its first impeachment inquiry into then-Presi-
dent Trump. His knowledge of House proce-
dure and parliamentary rules were critical as 
we navigated the first Presidential impeach-
ment in two decades—and again a year later 
as we conducted the second impeachment of 
that same president. 
John has played an integral role advising 
me, our subcommittee chairs, and staff over 
the course of more than 75 committee hear-
ings and more than 100 bill votes in com-
mittee and on the House floor. John also 
worked especially closely with our subcommit-
tees as we participated in several reconcili-
ation processes this Congress. 
John’s knowledge and counsel have been 
invaluable as we have worked to deliver tan-
gible results for the American people over the 
past two years. His guidance has helped us 
move dozens of bills through both chambers 
of Congress and to the President’s desk. We 
will miss John’s work ethic and counsel as he 
takes the next step in his career. 
We thank John for his service to the Com-
mittee and wish him the best of luck with this 
new chapter.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LULA MARIE EDWARDS 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life and legacy of Lula Marie 
Edwards, an entrepreneur, exemplary commu-
nity leader, and pioneering nurse during the 
Civil Rights Movement who passed at age 92 
on February 1, 2022. 
Mrs. Edwards was born one of six children 
on September 6, 1929, in Orville, AL, to the 
late James and Mary Scott-Harris. Valuing 
education even as a child, Mrs. Edwards was 
the first person in her family to graduate from 
high school at the top of the 1948 Keith High 
School inaugural graduating class. She contin-
ued her education at Selma University, where 
she studied to become an educator. However, 
after caring for her ailing brother Robert, Mrs. 
Edwards gained the attention of the nuns at 
Good Samaritan Hospital, and they encour-
aged her to become a nurse. Upon completing 
her LPN training at Good Samaritan School of 
Nursing in 1953, she served as a pioneering 
African American nurse treating the Foot Sol-
diers who were bludgeoned during ‘‘Bloody 
Sunday’’ in 1965, as they peacefully dem-
onstrated for the equal right to vote. 
During her time at Good Samaritan Hospital, 
Mrs. Edwards served dutifully, working in 
every area of the hospital from 1953 until the 
hospital’s closure. Continuing to serve her 
community as a healthcare professional, she 
went on to work at Vaughan Regional Hospital 
and Dr. Ernest Okeke Family Medicine before 
ultimately retiring from nursing in 1995 at 42. 
Upon her retirement, she was honored by Chi 
Eta Phi Nursing Sorority, Inc. for her extraor-
dinary contributions to the nursing profession. 
Spending much of her childhood in Siloam 
Baptist Church, Mrs. Edwards devoted her life 
to Christ at an early age. She was a member 
of the Queen of Peace Catholic Church before 
joining the Mt. Zion Primitive Baptist Church, 
where she faithfully served in various capac-
ities including, the Mother of the church, a 
member of the Missionary Society, and an ac-
tive Sunday school member. Mrs. Edwards 
was also an ardent fundraiser for the church 
and consistently encouraged the youth and 
supported all church activities. 
Dedicating her life to helping others, Mrs. 
Edwards exuded a sense of community, con-
tinuing, to help people outside of the hospital 
setting by opening her home to provide 
healthcare to people who otherwise would not 
have had access to it earning her the title 
‘‘neighborhood doctor.’’ As an enterprising 
woman, she also served as a landlord opening 
homes on her property once again, to those in 
need providing affordable housing for her ten-
ants and creating a safe haven for the entire 
community. 
Mrs. Edwards was preceded in death by her 
parents James and Mary Harris, loving hus-
band Amos Edwards, son James ‘‘Ebo’’ Ervin, 
sister Nellie B. Jackson, brothers Andrew 
Jackon (A.J.) Harris, James ‘‘Lil Buddy’’ Har-
ris, Jr., and grandson Kenneth ‘‘Ken Bear’’ 
Edwards Sr. She is survived by her children, 
Brenda (Steven) Brazzell, Anthony Edwards, 
Amy (Roosevelt) Marzette, Stephanie Menifee, 
Louis (Lisa) Edwards, Bonita (Calvin) An-
drews, and Derrick (Adrein) Edwards, sixty- 
two grandchildren, seventeen great-grand-
children, 
seven 
great-great 
grandchildren, 
brothers Robert Harris, Sr. and Lovie Lee Har-
ris, faithful God daughter Nancy Clark Jack-
son, and a host of additional relatives, mem-
bers of her church family, friends, and commu-
nity children. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the life and legacy of Lula Marie 
Edwards and her contributions to the Selma 
community.

TRIBUTE TO DR. DAVID E. RIVERS 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a man who was a com-
mitted educator and public servant, who lived 
by the Biblical teaching to ‘‘act justly, love 
mercy, and walk humbly.’’ He also happened 
to be a very dear friend for more than 40 
years, Dr. David E. Rivers transitioned from 
this life on February 4, 2022, and he will be 
sorely missed by all who had the honor of 
knowing him. 
Dr. Rivers was born on June 7, 1943, in 
Fayetteville, Georgia. He was the second of 
five children born to Joseph and Lorine Rivers. 
He earned undergraduate and graduate de-
grees in urban affairs, political science and 
public administration at Georgia State Univer-
sity. He went on to graduate from the National 
Urban Fellows Program in Public Administra-
tion at Yale University and the Riley Institute 
Diversity Leadership Program at Furman Uni-
versity. He was also a charter member of 
Georgia State University’s first Black Greek or-
ganization, Alpha Phi Alpha, Fraternity, Incor-
porated, which was chartered in 1968. 
Before beginning his professional career, 
Dr. Rivers, served three years in the U.S. 
Army. He became Atlanta’s first African Amer-
ican Commissioner of Budget and Planning 
under Mayor Maynard Jackson. He held lead-
ership positions on the Atlanta Regional Com-
mission, at Georgia State University, the U.S. 
Department off Health and Human Services, 
the U.S. Department of Energy and headed 
the Public Health Department in the District of 
Columbia Government under Mayor Marion 
Barry. 
All of these experiences were a precursor to 
his extraordinary career at the Medical Univer-
sity of South Carolina (MUSC). He joined 
MUSC’s faculty in 1995, and served in many 
distinguished capacities, promoting partner-
ships between academic institutions, govern-
ment agencies, elected officials, business in-
dustry, faith-based groups, and community ac-
tivists to build healthier communities. At the 
time of his death, Dr. Rivers was the Director 
of the Public Information and Community Out-
reach Initiative (PICO) at MUSC, a program 
he founded. 
Dr. Rivers served as Principal Investigator, 
administering over $20 million in sponsored 
funding during his career, and was a collabo-
rator in securing funding for over $100 million 
in national, state, and local programs during 
his career. Under his leadership, the PICO Ini-
tiative conducted nationwide Community Lead-
ers Institutes to address the impact of health 
disparities and environmental justice issues in 
low-income, ethnic minority communities and 
other underserved populations. 
South Carolina Educational Television pro-
duced his award-winning Community Leaders 
Institute programs, which were televised to na-
tional audiences. In recognition of his work on 
climate change and its impact across the 
United States, Dr. Rivers received multiple

tional dialogue to share progress in building 
healthy communities from 2007 through 2021. 
He also organized and led the Environmental 
Justice Braintrust at the Congressional Black 
Caucus Foundation, Inc.’s Annual Legislative 
Conference. The Braintrust recommended 
strategies to help policy makers address envi-
ronmental issues by fostering a relationship 
between environmental protection, human 
health, environmental justice, and economic 
development. 
In 2009, Dr. Rivers became the first African 
American to hold a citywide elected office in 
Charleston, SC. He served as a Commis-
sioner of Public Works for the City of Charles-
ton since 2009, where he also served as Vice

ance Bank, and the Trident Urban League. He

liance.

leagues to join me in celebrating the life and 
legacy of Dr. David Rivers. His impact can be 
felt across this country in so many commu-
nities that are addressing environmental jus-
tice and health disparities, and his work will 
continue through the initiatives he developed 
and nurtured throughout his career. Dr. Rivers 
led a life of purpose driven by passion. May 
he rest in power. 
CELEBRATING THE RETIREMENT 
OF SHERIFF BARRY VIRTS 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the career of Sheriff Barry Virts, who re-
tired December 31, 2021 after 44 years with 
the Wayne County Sheriff’s Department. A 
dedicated public servant, Sheriff Virts dem-
onstrated a profound commitment to public 
safety throughout his career. 
Sherriff Virts is a lifelong resident of the 
Town of Rose in Wayne County, New York 
and graduate of North Rose-Wolcott High 
School. He earned an Associate’s degree from 
Erie Community College and began his career 
in law enforcement in 1977 as a corrections 
officer for the Wayne County Sheriff’s Office. 
Sherriff Virts was quickly promoted to road pa-
trol deputy a year later, sergeant in 1985, and 
criminal investigations lieutenant in 1988. In 
1999, he began overseeing the Wayne County 
jail as Chief Deputy. 
Following ten years with the jail division, in 
2009 Sherriff Virts was elected Sheriff of 
Wayne County. At the outset of his term, 
Sheriff Virts placed a significant emphasis on 
improving support for victims and collaboration 
between various police departments. For his 
work, Sheriff Virts has received local honors 
and served on over thirteen community and 
advisory boards including the Wayne County 
Criminal Justice Council, Wayne County Jail 
Advisory, Victim Resource Center, Wayne 
County Diversity Task Force, Wayne County 
Pretrial Youth and Adult Diversion. He also 
served on the Council on Alcoholism & Other 
Addictions, Wayne County Fire Chief’s Asso-
ciation, and the Wayne County Housing Con-
sortium. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
in the House join me in recognizing the career 
of Sheriff Barry Virts and his commitment to 
public safety. I wish Sheriff Virts the best in 
his retirement.

REMEMBERING CHESTER ALAN 
BARTOL 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember Chester ‘‘Chet’’ Bartol of Fort 
Wayne who passed away last month. 
Chet was a hard-working, intelligent man 
who served our country and his community 
with joy. He graduated Warsaw High School in 
1945 and attended Purdue University, where 
he earned a degree in Electrical Engineering. 
For nearly fifty years, he worked in ortho-
pedics as a distributor and was the owner of 
Zimmer-Bartol Associates. 
In addition to his academic and career pedi-
gree, Chet was a veteran of the United States 
Army, having served in the Electrical Warfare 
Division of the Signal Corps. Northeast Indi-
ana, and our country, is grateful to him for his 
service. 
He is remembered as having been particu-
larly active, sociable and selfless. A lifelong 
fan of Purdue sports, Chet ran high school 
and college track, and into old age remained 
a golfer and avid cardplayer. He is also re-
membered as having been a loving husband, 
father and friend. He is survived by his wife, 
Shirley, five children, eleven grandchildren and 
two great-grandchildren. 
In the wake of his passing, I wish Chet’s 
family peace, comfort and joy in knowing he 
lived a long and happy life. Though he is no 
longer alive, his spirit lives on in the minds 
and souls of those whom he knew and loved 
most.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
JOHN BREHM 
HON. ADRIAN SMITH 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, February 8, 2022 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to honor the career of Scotts Bluff 
County Veteran’s Service Officer John Brehm. 
For nearly 50 years John has devoted his life 
to honoring and meeting the needs of Amer-
ican veterans and their families. Prior to this 
John served for three years in the United 
States Army, stationed near the 38th parallel 
in South Korea as well as Fort Carson, CO. 
His recent retirement marks a legacy of faithful 
service to others who sacrificed for our nation. 
Despite his reluctance to assume credit for 
himself, the significance of John’s impact is 
widely recognized. His accomplishments in-
clude restoring annual commencement of the 
local Veterans Day parade, partnering with the 
American Legion to organize County Govern-
ment Day visits for high school students, and 
spearheading the establishment of Avenue of 
Flags displays as well as Veterans Memorial 
Park which now bears his name in my own 
hometown of Gering. 
John has showed personal concern for each 
veteran he served, knowing full well the impor-
tance of going the extra mile. In addition to fa-
cilitating disability claims, his efforts fund-
raising for Disabled American Veterans vans 
have meant a great deal to veterans in need 
of transportation to health facilities in our 
sprawling, rural region. 
John Brehm’s dedication and patriotism are 
rare. His expertise will be missed, but we are 
grateful for his ongoing engagement as a cit-
izen. 
Countless 
Nebraskans 
have 
been 
blessed by his care, and generations to come 
are indebted to his example.
