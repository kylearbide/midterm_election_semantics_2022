PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our Redeemer, we approach You 
humbly asking that You sanctify this 
day and the proceedings that are about 
to unfold. But we dare not ask Your 
favor until we receive Your forgive-
ness. We confess our complicity in the 
animosity and betrayal felt throughout 
our Nation. We pray Your forgiveness 
for the pride and selfish ambition lurk-
ing in the hearts of even the best of 
people. Have mercy on those who suffer 
the injustices we have unknowingly or 
knowingly perpetuated that have di-
vided our country. 
Don’t give us up to these vain incli-
nations, but save us from ourselves. 
Preserve each of us, those who speak 
and those who hear, from being caught 
up in the hatred and vitriol ever 
present in these contentious delibera-
tions. 
Then give us the favor of Your pres-
ence among us, that our eyes will be 
open to the light of Your truth. In the 
transforming of our minds, may we dis-
cern Your will in these decisions of 
great import and national impact. 
We pray these things in the strength 
of Your holy name. 
Amen.

Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), pending 
which I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. During consideration of 
this resolution, all time yielded is for 
the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, today 
the Rules Committee met and reported 
a closed rule, House Resolution 38, pro-
viding for consideration of House Reso-
lution 21, calling on Vice President MI-
CHAEL R. PENCE to convene and mobi-
lize the principal officers of the execu-
tive departments of the Cabinet to ac-
tivate section 4 of the 25th Amendment 
to declare President Donald J. Trump 
incapable of executing the duties of his 
office and to immediately exercise 
powers as acting President. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary or a designee. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment by Chairman NADLER. The 
rule provides that the prohibition 
against engaging in personalities dur-
ing debate, with respect to references 
to the President, shall not apply during 
consideration of House Resolution 21 or 
any special order of business relating 
to the impeachment of the President 
considered on January 13, 2021. 
Finally, the rule authorizes and di-
rects the Sergeant at Arms to impose a 
fine against a Member, Delegate, or the 
Resident Commissioner for the failure 
to wear a mask in contravention of the 
Speaker’s announced policy on this 
subject for the duration of the pan-
demic. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to de-
bate the rule for House Resolution 21, a 
resolution calling for Vice President 
PENCE to invoke the 25th Amendment 
and declare President Donald Trump 
incapable of executing the duties of his 
office. We take this action solemnly 
and with grave concern for the safety 
and security of our Nation and its peo-
ple, even in the final days of this Presi-
dent’s administration. 
Last 
Wednesday, 
a 
lawless 
mob 
breached this Chamber with the most 
evil and destructive intent. They were 
here to take the law into their own 
hands, to disrupt Congress as it count-
ed the electoral college votes, and to 
overturn the lawful election of Joseph 
Biden as our 46th President. 
As violent invaders broke windows 
and rammed doors, they chanted that 
they wanted to hang the Vice Presi-
dent and kidnap the Speaker of the 
House, and they brought the tools to do 
it. They beat one police officer to 
death, tased others, and tried to shoot 
one with his own gun. Another officer 
will likely lose an eye. Scores of others

January 12, 2021 
suffered head injuries when they were 
beaten with pipes. Blood was spilled on 
the marble floor just outside this room. 
Members, staff, and reporters were 
forced to take cover under furniture 
and barricade themselves in rooms, 
clutching gas masks and fearing for 
their lives as the President’s MAGA 
supporters chanted and raged nearby. 
Journalists were specifically targeted 
and beaten. Explosive devices were 
placed nearby to divert the police from 
protecting the Capitol. 
This was not a peaceful protest. 
These were crimes against our country 
and the people who go to work every 
day on Capitol Hill. Just this after-
noon, the FBI announced that it ex-
pects to charge hundreds of people with 
crimes ranging from simple trespass to 
conspiracy and sedition, to weapons of-
fenses, to felony murder. 
Crimes like this do not occur in a 
vacuum. They must be planned. They 
must be led. 
The attack on the Capitol was in-
cited 
by 
this 
administration. 
For 
months, they told their supporters that 
if they didn’t win the election, the 
election was rigged. When the majority 
of American voters decided they had 
had enough of this chaos, they declared 
that the election had been stolen. The 
administration invited the President’s 
most rabid supporters to come to D.C. 
on January 6 for a wild protest. Then 
the administration whipped them into 
a frenzy and sent the mob across town 
to attack the Capitol and disrupt the 
counting of electoral college votes. But 
it didn’t end there. 
The President reportedly watched 
with excitement as the news media 
began streaming images of the terror 
at the Capitol through electronic de-
vices in America and around the world. 
The President tweeted that the Vice 
President had betrayed him. And even 
after the violence was apparent, the 
President and his lawyer placed calls 
to allies on Capitol Hill, trying to per-
suade them to prolong their objections 
to the counting of the electoral votes. 
What the administration didn’t do for 
hours was to lift a finger to call off the 
mob or to rally support to defend the 
government, the historic monuments 
in the Capitol, the police, or especially 
the people under siege in the building. 
Members here in this Chamber know 
that, for hours, the President refused 
to return their calls begging for help. 
Mr. Speaker, in the days since, the 
administration has continued to claim 
that the election was rigged. It has de-
nied any responsibility for the riot, and 
praised the rioters, all while reports 
proliferate that the administration’s 
supporters are planning more violence 
in the weeks ahead. 
This is why this President remains a 
clear and present danger to the coun-
try, so long as he continues to serve. 
The reality is that we all—even the 
most loyal political supporters—know 
that this President is unfit for office. 
Any other President with an ounce of 
character would have resigned after 
seeing the bloody consequences of the 
actions on Wednesday. Any other ad-
ministration would have invoked the 
25th Amendment long ago. 
I don’t care if a President incites a 
riot against Congress on his first day 
or the last day of his or her Presidency. 
Such an act is a crime against our gov-
ernment, much less against the people 
who are terrorized or killed in the at-
tack. If a President can refuse to ac-
knowledge the will of American voters, 
then incite a coup to stay in power 
without punishment, then our democ-
racy is lost. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why it is vital 
for Vice President PENCE and the Cabi-
net to do the right thing—to invoke 
the 25th Amendment. Otherwise, this 
Congress must remove Donald Trump 
from office. 
I have heard the calls for unity, and 
I agree that now is the time to come 
forward in unity, to defend our coun-
try, not to defend a man who has prov-
en himself incompetent to occupy the 
office of the President for another day. 
I am grateful to those Members of 
the Republican Party who agreed that 
the time has come to put loyalty to 
country above partisan considerations. 
And we welcome their support in tak-
ing whatever actions are necessary to 
end this chaos, to defend our govern-
ment, and to protect the American peo-
ple. 
b 1830 
I also find the cries of partisanship 
by the President’s remaining sup-
porters to be unconvincing. The whole 
world watched in horror on January 6 
as the administration encouraged a 
mob to attack the seat of our democ-
racy to disrupt the election of Joseph 
R. Biden and then stood by as rioters 
sacked the Capitol. 
Many civic leaders from both parties 
have condemned the President’s ac-
tions and called for his removal. So, 
no, this is not partisan. 
But I invite the President’s sup-
porters in Congress—no, I beg them—to 
join the American people in holding 
this President accountable for the vio-
lence we experienced last week and to 
prevent further chaos in the days to 
come. 
Before I conclude, I want to take a 
minute to give my deepest condolences 
to the families of the Capitol Police of-
ficers who died as a result of this at-
tack. I want to thank the men and 
women of the Metropolitan and Capitol 
Police forces who valiantly defended 
both our democracy and the people who 
work on the Hill and wish a speedy re-
covery to the scores who were injured 
during the attack. 
I also want to thank our tireless fa-
cilities and custodial staff for putting 
the building back together after terror-
ists violated it and the members of the 
press corps who have been so abused by 
this administration and were specifi-
cally targeted by this mob but contin-
ued documenting the attack so Ameri-
cans could see what was really hap-
pening. 
Lastly, I want to thank our staff 
across the Capitol for their bravery and 
dedication to public service. I want to 
thank them for the work they do every 
day but especially for their heroism in 
returning to the floor last Wednesday 
night to help us continue the electoral 
college vote count, and I thank them 
for being back here with us today. We 
are indebted to them for their service 
to our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
friend, the gentlewoman from Pennsyl-
vania (Ms. SCANLON) for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes, and I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Just a few days ago, the Nation was 
shaken by the violent and destructive 
actions of an outrageous mob that 
stormed the Capitol and attempted to 
gain access to this very Chamber, seek-
ing to harm innocent lives and disrupt 
democracy at work. 
I vehemently condemn their lawless 
actions. This never should have hap-
pened, and the perpetrators of these 
despicable crimes that took place in 
this building must be prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law. 
While Americans have the right to 
passionately voice their views and 
peacefully dissent in protest, the siege 
on our Capitol last Wednesday was the 
furthest thing from peaceful protest. 
As a result of the violent and fright-
ening events of the day, six lives have 
been lost. 
This includes two courageous Capitol 
Police officers who put themselves in 
harm’s way to protect us, secure the 
building, and restore order. We will 
never forget their selfless sacrifices 
and bravery. Our deepest prayers re-
main with their families, friends, loved 
ones, and the entire United States Cap-
itol Police force as they grapple with 
their heavy loss. 
As we seek to pick up the pieces and 
move forward healing our Nation, I am 
concerned that the majority is pro-
ceeding with the wrong course of ac-
tion. 
Earlier today, Mr. Speaker, the Rules 
Committee met and reported out a rule 
for consideration of House Resolution 
21. This is a nonbinding resolution call-
ing on Vice President MIKE PENCE to 
convene the Cabinet and declare Presi-
dent Trump incapable of executing his 
duties pursuant to section 4 of the 25th 
Amendment. 
I think this resolution is misguided 
and inappropriate for the legislative 
branch to pursue. As such, I must op-
pose it. 
Mr. Speaker, under the 25th Amend-
ment to the Constitution, when it ap-
pears the President is unable to fulfill 
his or her duties, it is the responsi-
bility of the Vice President, with the 
concurrence of a majority of the Cabi-
net, to initiate the process for making 
that determination. 
That responsibility, grave as it is, 
rests solely with the Vice President. 
There is no role for Congress in this

process. The only role for Congress 
arises later and only in the cir-
cumstances where there is a dispute be-
tween the President and Vice President 
about the President’s ability to fulfill 
his or her duties, but we are not faced 
with that situation now. 
Nor is this resolution intended to 
designate, by law, another body besides 
the Cabinet to exercise this power, 
which the text of the 25th Amendment 
says it may do. Instead, with today’s 
resolution, what the majority is asking 
the House to do is to assume a power it 
does not have. The House has no role in 
initiating section 4 of the 25th Amend-
ment, and we should not pretend other-
wise. Instead, that power lies with the 
Vice President. 
And we should be very clear about 
what this resolution actually is. It is 
an attempt to pressure the Vice Presi-
dent into performing a duty he clearly 
does not believe is necessary at this 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I was here in the Cap-
itol last week, as were all of my col-
leagues. We all had the opportunity to 
watch Vice President PENCE as he ful-
filled his duty under the Constitution. 
He showed sound judgment and poise 
under pressure, and his actions were 
above reproach. Indeed, he fulfilled his 
oath of office and acted in a manner be-
fitting his constitutional role. It was a 
statesman-like performance under the 
most difficult of circumstances. 
Despite witnessing the Vice Presi-
dent’s sound judgment and ability to 
fulfill his oath in person, the majority 
is now seeking to push him into per-
forming an additional action under the 
25th Amendment. The Vice President 
has not done what the majority wishes 
him to do, and so they are bringing up 
this resolution now in effort to pres-
sure him into doing so. 
This act, attempting to substitute 
the House’s judgment for the Vice 
President’s, is not contemplated any-
where in the Constitution. As we all 
saw last Wednesday, Vice President 
PENCE’s judgment is sound. There is no 
need for the House to attempt to sub-
stitute its judgment for his own. 
I personally have strong faith in him, 
and I believe he will consider his con-
stitutional duty in the same manner 
that he carries out all of the other con-
stitutional duties assigned to him: in a 
forthright manner that fulfills his oath 
of office and attests to his personal in-
tegrity. 
Should the Vice President ever be-
lieve that the 25th Amendment needs 
to be invoked, I have no doubt that 
Vice President PENCE, both as a leader, 
as a former House colleague, and as a 
friend, would exercise good judgment 
with respect to performing that duty. 
That he has not taken that action thus 
far is not an indication that the House 
needs to push him to do so. His record 
of sound judgment should speak to us 
on this issue. 
As such, I urge my colleagues to re-
ject this resolution. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on the rule, a ‘‘no’’ vote on the under-
lying measure, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the gentlewoman from Penn-
sylvania for her leadership and my 
good friend from Oklahoma as well. 
My friend from Oklahoma may be, in 
fact, accurate to the extent that the 
25th Amendment stands on its own as 
actions that the Vice President will 
take. But we are a coequal branch of 
government, and Mr. RASKIN’s resolu-
tion is an appropriate resolution be-
cause we have a responsibility to gov-
ern and to protect the American peo-
ple. 
So this resolution is not in violation 
of the Constitution, because it is the 
Congress calling upon the Vice Presi-
dent to reflect on January 6, a day in 
infamy, to reflect the fact that there 
were six people who died, that we lost 
two precious law enforcement Capitol 
Hill Police, their injuries in many ways 
attributable to this, some in different 
ways than others, and we lost Ameri-
cans. 
Clearly, it is a long chain of events 
that goes back to the President of the 
United States. The President, when a 
duly announced election came about on 
November 6, 2020, proceeded to declare 
that it had been stolen and continued 
to stoke the fires of his believers to 
begin to plan some kind of attack, be-
cause he kept saying, ‘‘Come to Wash-
ington. I will see you there.’’ 
Then, of course, as time went on, I 
valued the President’s right to the 
courts, of which he went, but he did not 
find that to be a solution for him. 
So House Resolution 21 is the Con-
gress speaking, and we have every 
right, as a coequal branch, to speak. 
Why? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Texas an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. We have that 
right, Mr. Speaker, because the FBI 
has indicated that they have seen 
100,000 digital media, and they will be 
looking for more to see those who en-
dangered all of those who were here. 
My appreciation to the police and the 
floor staff and law enforcement, custo-
dial staff, our staff, media, and others 
who were put in harm’s way along with 
Members. 
So I rise to support this resolution 
because it does not violate the Con-
stitution or the intent of the 25th 
Amendment. It provides for the Con-
gress to speak to ask the Vice Presi-
dent to recognize that this President is 
the only one who has ever stoked this 
kind of action. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), who 
is my very good friend and fellow mem-
ber of the Rules Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the rule. 
Over the last week, we have heard 
calls from both parties’ leaders, past 
and present, about the need for unity 
in our Nation. We have heard Presi-
dent-elect Biden and other members of 
the Democratic Party call for unity, a 
path forward for our Nation full of mu-
tual consideration and respect. 
Yet here we are today with Demo-
crats charging in the opposite direc-
tion, further dividing our Nation by 
calling for the invocation of the 25th 
Amendment by the Vice President. 
Let’s consider this for a moment. My 
Democratic colleagues are demanding 
Vice President PENCE invoke the 25th 
Amendment and take over as Presi-
dent. With these calls, it is clear they 
have full faith in the Vice President 
and his ability to act in a manner that 
is consistent with his constitutional 
responsibility. Simply put, they trust 
him to do the job. 
Yet the very demand they are mak-
ing insinuates that Vice President 
PENCE cannot be trusted to make the 
decision to invoke the 25th Amendment 
on his own. It calls into question the 
core of his judgment. 
If you trust someone to lead our Na-
tion and be the acting President, 
shouldn’t you also trust that same per-
son to take the steps necessary to safe-
guard it if needed? 
With that, I urge opposition to the 
rule. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with great sadness and anger 
over the events that transpired on Jan-
uary 6, and I rise with steadfast deter-
mination to take every possible action 
to ensure that those who incited and 
committed the unconscionable acts on 
that day are brought to justice. 
Last week’s violent insurrection on 
the U.S. Capitol left at least six people 
dead and dozens injured. It was a stain 
on our Nation and our democracy. 
They beat police officers, they mur-
dered a police officer, they planted pipe 
bombs, they brandished weapons, and 
they left our Nation shocked and 
mourning. 
Just as this Congress returned mere 
hours after this insurrection to certify 
the lawful results of the 2020 Presi-
dential election, we stand here today 
prepared to take firm, decisive, and 
necessary action to restore our coun-
try. 
No President who invites thousands 
of his most devoted supporters to 
Washington and urges them to fight his 
political enemies by committing a se-
ditious act on our democracy should be 
allowed to remain in office. 
If the Vice President does not act to 
hold the President accountable, then 
we leave this Nation vulnerable to fu-
ture demagogues. 
That brings us here today, on this 
somber day, to carry out our sacred 
oath to defend and protect the Con-
stitution from all enemies, foreign and 
domestic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H129 
January 12, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I will vote to impeach 
those responsible, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great sadness 
and anger over the events that transpired on 
January 6th, and steadfast determination to 
take every possible action to ensure those 
who incited and committed the unconscionable 
acts on that day are brought to justice. 
Last week’s violent insurrection on the U.S. 
Capitol, which has left at least five people 
dead and dozens injured, was a stain on our 
nation and our democracy. The President’s 
blatantly false claims about election fraud, 
which were parroted by current administration 
officials and members of the House and Sen-
ate, finally reached a tipping point last week 
when these boldface lies gave way to a violent 
assault on our nation’s Capitol. Even after 64 
failed attempts in federal court to substantiate 
the baseless claims about election fraud, the 
President, his administration, and members of 
Congress continued to double down and use 
these mistruths to incite a mob to stage a 
bloody insurrection against the United States 
Government. They beat and murdered police 
officers, they planted pipe bombs, brandished 
weapons, and left our nation shocked and in 
mourning. 
What does it mean, then, for America that a 
sitting President invited thousands of his most 
fervent supporters to Washington and incited 
them to commence a violent occupation of the 
world’s citadel of democracy—the United 
States Capitol? 
Without a proper check and proportional re-
sponse to these events, we will be doomed to 
re-live the same hell over and over again. In 
time, we will lose our democracy, our hallowed 
institutions, and irreparably tear at the very 
fabric of our nation. As elected leaders of this 
nation, we have a right, but more importantly, 
a moral obligation to respond to those who in-
cited this riot in the strongest possible terms. 
Just as this Congress returned mere hours 
after this insurrection to certify the lawful re-
sults of the 2020 Presidential election, we 
stand here today prepared to take firm, deci-
sive, and necessary action to restore our 
country from the heinous state it spiraled into 
on 1/6/2021. 
Mr. Speaker I rise today to implore the Vice 
President of the United States and the mem-
bers of the President’s cabinet to invoke the 
25th Amendment and remove this dangerous 
President from office before he can inflict 
more harm on our nation. It’s time for the Vice 
President to stand up for American democ-
racy. I will also join my colleagues in sup-
porting articles of impeachment against the 
President. 
The President’s violent rhetoric and actions 
pose a significant threat to our nation with 
every passing minute that he’s allowed to re-
main in office. No President who invites thou-
sands of his most devoted supporters to 
Washington and urges them to ‘‘fight’’ his po-
litical enemies by committing a seditious at-
tack on our Capitol should be allowed to re-
main in office. Our nation has endured and 
persevered through so much, and it will sur-
vive this President. But if we do not act and 
hold him accountable, then we will leave our 
nation vulnerable to a future demagogue. That 
brings us here on this somber day to carry out 
our sacred oath to defend and protect the 
Constitution from all enemies foreign and do-
mestic. 
I will vote to impeach this President, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately bring 
up a resolution establishing a bipar-
tisan national commission on the do-
mestic terrorist attack on the United 
States Capitol. 
This commission, modeled on the 9/11 
Commission, will be charged with ex-
amining and reporting upon the facts 
and causes relating to the attack that 
occurred on January 6 of 2021 and with 
providing appropriate findings, conclu-
sions, and recommendations for correc-
tive measures. 
I can think of no more appropriate 
path for Congress to follow, Mr. Speak-
er, than to ensure that a bipartisan 
commission reviews all evidence and 
reports back to us on this horrific 
event. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from the great State of Ken-
tucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) for further expla-
nation of the amendment. 
b 1845 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma for 
yielding. 
All of us just still are speechless 
about what happened last Wednesday. 
It is just amazing that it happened 
here, and I condemn it in the utmost 
words as a violent act against the Cap-
itol Building. We must find those who 
did it, and we must prosecute them to 
the fullest extent of the law. 
Every time I travel to Washington, 
the first thing I look for, as I did 
today, is if I could see it from my air-
plane window or if I could see it driving 
across the Potomac, the dome. I always 
feel pride that the people of the Second 
District of Kentucky, Mr. Speaker, 
allow me to serve under the dome. 
When I got here today, it is still here. 
It is still standing. It is still the beacon 
throughout the world. It is bruised, but 
it is there. It is something that we all 
hold dear. 
The protection of this building, that 
dome, this building, the office build-
ings but, most importantly, the people 
who work here, not those of us who are 
just elected to be here but those of us 
who work here and in service, I have 
faces I have talked to tonight on the 
floor that—I was not on the floor when 
it happened, but I knew the faces of the 
people who were, not just my col-
leagues, but those standing at the 
doors here tonight, Mr. Speaker, who 
have been through so much. 
We can’t let this happen again. If we 
defeat the PQ, the amendment my 
friend from Oklahoma has is a bipar-
tisan commission to examine the cir-
cumstances and the attack, as well as 
its aftermath. 
It will be modeled after 9/11 Commis-
sion to reduce duplication and increase 
communication and info-sharing be-
tween relevant government entities 
and law enforcement. The goal is to in-
vestigate, find the facts, and deliver re-
ports so this can never happen again, 
and so we can better protect the Cap-
itol complex and, most importantly, 
the employees that work here, serving 
our great country. We will protect 
them moving forward. 
We all want answers, and this is the 
most prudent step at this time. We will 
follow wherever the facts lead us and 
take appropriate actions in response. 
I urge the defeat of the PQ and the 
adoption of the amendment. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, we, of 
course, share the concern of our col-
leagues from the other side of the aisle 
that an incident like this never hap-
pens again. That is why we are urging 
the Vice President to invoke the 25th 
Amendment, because of the clear and 
present danger of continued violence 
under this administration. 
While I believe there will be a time 
to talk about bipartisan efforts to have 
an investigation through this House, 
this is not the moment for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
MATSUI), a distinguished former mem-
ber of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the rule providing 
for consideration of the resolution be-
fore us today, calling on the Vice 
President to invoke the Fifth Amend-
ment and remove President Trump 
from office immediately. 
Last week, members of both parties 
came to the floor of this Chamber to 
take the oath of office. In that oath, 
each of us pledged to defend the Con-
stitution against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic. I believe that oath com-
pels me and my colleagues to act 
today. 
Last Wednesday’s armed insurrection 
at the United States Capitol was a co-
ordinated attempt to overthrow our 
democratic 
process 
with 
violence. 
Make no mistake, these rioters viewed 
the President’s repeated claims of 
fraud as a mandate to act. Lies, misin-
formation, and demagoguery have con-
sequences. 
Unfortunately, 
America 
witnessed 
those consequences last week, some on 
television, some under tables in barri-
caded offices, some in these Chambers, 
and some in the last moments of life. 
It is not with joy that I immediately 
called on Vice President PENCE to in-
voke the 25th Amendment. I am co-
sponsor of both this resolution and the 
Articles of Impeachment because I be-
lieve I have an obligation to honor my 
oath 
and 
defend 
the 
Constitution 
against a grave domestic threat.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H130 
January 12, 2021 
On a personal note, I am taking this 
stand for the future of my grand-
children. Our obligation to them and to 
future generations is that this democ-
racy stands. 
So, it is with sadness but firm resolve 
that I rise to support this rule and im-
plore my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle to join me. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan (Mrs. MCCLAIN), who will be giving 
her first address on the floor of the 
House. 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
I rise today to echo many of my col-
leagues in the call for unity and a 
peaceful transition of power. I say this 
as a believer in the Constitution and 
the fact that the election has been cer-
tified. 
First, the incitement of politically 
motivated violence that we saw last 
week is intolerable. Words have con-
sequences, and, yes, the President 
could have done more. But I ask you 
this: Doesn’t everybody need to play by 
the same rules? 
Let me highlight some other ques-
tionable statements. 
And I quote: ‘‘Let’s make sure we 
show up wherever we have to show up. 
And if you see anybody from that Cabi-
net in a restaurant, in a department 
store, at a gas station, you get out and 
you create a crowd, and you push back 
on them, and you tell them they are 
not 
welcome 
anymore, 
anywhere.’’ 
That was not President Trump. 
Let me give you another one. ‘‘I just 
don’t even know why there aren’t 
uprisings all over the country.’’ Again, 
not President Trump. 
Can we all agree that at times our 
emotions get in the way because we 
love this country so much? But I ask 
you this: Whatever is good for one side, 
isn’t it good for the other? 
We all have the same name on the 
front of our jersey, and that is the 
United States of America. We need to 
start acting like it and let our actions 
follow our words. 
Impeachment only incites more divi-
sion. It does not provide unity. 
I offer a solution. I am ready to come 
together and get to work for this great 
country in which we live. 
Ms. SCANLON. I would just suggest 
that sedition is inherently divisive, and 
it is difficult to unify before there has 
been accountability. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, I support 
invoking the 25th Amendment to re-
move President Trump from office. 
Former Congressman Tom Lantos, a 
Holocaust survivor, would often say 
the veneer of civilization is paper-thin. 
We are its guardians, and we cannot 
rest. 
I was sitting right there on Wednes-
day when they told us to take out our 
gas masks because the rioters had 
breached the Capitol. 
I was standing right over there as the 
Capitol Police locked and barricaded 
the Chamber doors. I heard what I 
thought were gunshots as the rioters 
broke the windows in the main Cham-
ber door with a metal pipe. 
I was standing right over there when 
the woman was shot outside the Speak-
er’s lobby, and the police radios rang 
out: ‘‘Shots fired in the Capitol. Shots 
fired in the Capitol. Everyone down.’’ 
The veneer of civilization is paper- 
thin. 
Thousands of people, criminals, dese-
crated our Capitol, breaking windows 
and doors, attacking our brave officers, 
and vandalizing offices. Rioters, wear-
ing Army fatigues with Confederate 
and Trump flags, donned Nazi swas-
tikas. That and I saw one man who 
wore a shirt saying: ‘‘Camp Auschwitz 
Staff.’’ 
Our President instigated this. The 
President’s duty is to protect our Re-
public and its people. He built a mob, 
filled it with lies, and encouraged its 
fight to stop the steal. Now, we hear 
intelligence reports that thousands of 
armed militias and white supremacists 
are planning to come again on or be-
fore January 20. 
My colleagues, my friends on the 
other side of the aisle, we must to-
gether call upon the President to de-
nounce this violence, to tell his sup-
porters to stay home. 
Mr. President, you must please put 
America first. You must call off this 
attack. And if not, you must be re-
moved. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. RESCHENTHALER), who is 
the newest Republican member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, let me be clear about something. 
The violence and the rioting in our 
Capitol last Wednesday was tragic. It 
was undemocratic, and it was unac-
ceptable. I unequivocally condemn this 
criminal behavior that occurred in this 
building. 
Our great Nation is deeply divided. 
Unfortunately, rather than looking for-
ward and working together on issues 
that actually unite our country, we are 
here debating a partisan issue, a par-
tisan resolution that will only further 
divide us. 
The Constitution is very clear on the 
issue we are debating. The ability to 
activate section 4 of the 25th Amend-
ment lies with the Vice President and 
Cabinet members, Cabinet members 
who are vetted and confirmed by the 
Senate. 
Congress is only drawn in, House 
Members are only drawn in, when the 
President disputes a declaration of in-
capacitation. That is not what is hap-
pening here. We should respect that 
constitutional prerogative. 
Mr. Speaker, I am also perplexed by 
my Democrat colleagues’ attempt to 
force the hand of a man that they 
clearly had faith in to run our country. 
They must recognize that by calling 
for the President’s immediate resigna-
tion, they are also advocating for Vice 
President MIKE PENCE to lead our Na-
tion. Therefore, they should have full 
trust in Vice President PENCE’s deci-
sion-making ability to act in a manner 
consistent with his constitutional re-
sponsibilities, just as he did last week. 
Further, I am incredibly and deeply 
disappointed that the rule before us 
suspends prohibitions on engaging in 
personalities against the President. It 
is somewhat ironic. If we are truly wor-
ried about rhetoric, then we must set 
an example and ensure that civility 
and decorum remain an essential part 
of the American discourse. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, we must set an example and ensure 
that civility and decorum remain an 
essential part of the American dis-
course. 
Ms. SCANLON. Just to clarify, this 
provision about suspending the rule 
about personalities is so that we can 
have a full and frank discussion of just 
why the request is being made to in-
voke the 25th Amendment and just why 
this President should be impeached. It 
would be difficult, if not impossible, to 
describe the high crimes and mis-
demeanors and other misconduct which 
forms the basis of those requests if 
that rule were not suspended. 
As I mentioned in my opening, we 
don’t view this as a partisan resolu-
tion. We have Members from all sides 
of the political spectrum now calling 
for the removal of this President. Mem-
bers might want to check their news 
feed to see the growing list of civic, 
business, and religious leaders from 
across the country who have said: 
Enough is enough. This President is a 
clear and present danger. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I would disagree somewhat with my 
good friend from Pennsylvania. I have 
had the privilege of being in this body 
for many years, and I have never seen 
what we see in sections 2 and 3 of this 
rule, the suspension of appropriate lan-
guage. 
I understand the difficulties of deal-
ing with this issue and respect that. 
However, at a time when the rhetoric 
has been over the top, I think we 
should set a high example. We have 
never done this before in my time here. 
We didn’t do it in previous impeach-
ments. 
b 1900 
The need to do it now is lost on me, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Again, I have great confidence in my 
friend. I have great confidence in my 
friends on the Rules Committee.

January 12, 2021 
So, the rule is the rule. This will al-
most certainly pass. I would just hope 
that everybody acts as good as they 
can. I mean, I hate to put it that sim-
ply, but this is an important issue. 
I respect all the Members of this 
body. I know they have very different 
points of view on this. That is to be ex-
pected. 
Generally, our debates are profes-
sional. Generally, that standard is 
something we are proud of and some-
thing that we aspire to. I hate to see it 
ever lowered or any exception provided. 
I also have great confidence in the 
Speaker’s Chair, and I know that they 
will enforce the appropriate level of ci-
vility and decency on the floor. 
But, Mr. Speaker, I just ask my fel-
low Members to please, please think 
about this, because we have taken a 
very important safeguard off the rails 
of debate, so to speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JORDAN), my 
very good friend, the distinguished Re-
publican ranking member of the Judi-
ciary Committee. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. 
COLE) for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, this is scary. This is 
frightening, what is happening. 
With less than 1 hour of debate, the 
Democrats bring a rule to the floor 
that says this: You can say anything 
you want about the President of the 
United States of America, no rules of 
decorum about what you say about the 
leader of our country. 
In that rule, they say: If you don’t 
wear a mask, you could get fined, no 
regard to whether you have already 
had COVID, whether you have had the 
vaccination. Your mask slips down a 
little bit, you get fined, in a rule with 
no debate? 
In this rule, they say: To walk on the 
House floor, you have to go through a 
metal detector, a Member of the United 
States Congress walking on the floor to 
represent three quarters of a million 
people in our district? 
And fourth, the rule is for the bill 
that says we should tell the Vice Presi-
dent of the United States to work to 
remove the President of the United 
States. 
I have been here 14 years. I have 
never seen anything like this. And I do 
not know where this ends. I do not 
know where it ends, but it is dangerous 
where they are taking us. 
You couple this with what we are 
seeing with the cancel culture mob out 
there, I do not know where this takes 
us. 
I fear for the First Amendment. I 
fear for the Second Amendment. I fear 
for the Bill of Rights. I fear for the 
Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where 
this takes us, but it is scary what they 
are throwing in a bill that we are going 
to debate for less than an hour, making 
these kinds of changes. I hope they re-
consider. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. I would inquire if the 
gentleman has any more speakers. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to 
urge all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this resolution. 
The resolution asks this House to 
substitute its judgment for the Vice 
President’s in making the grave deci-
sion to initiate procedures under sec-
tion 4 of the 25th Amendment. Under 
the Constitution, this is a role that be-
longs exclusively to the Vice President 
and the Cabinet, not to the House of 
Representatives. Attempting to usurp 
this responsibility is not supported by 
the Constitution and would be a his-
toric overreach. 
Members should also take assurance 
from the Vice President’s strong record 
of sound judgment. Rather than pres-
suring him into acting, we should be 
reassured by the knowledge that he 
would act on this topic as he does on 
all others in performing his duty, in a 
manner befitting his constitutional 
role as Vice President of the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question and 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, after the chaos and po-
tentially—well, definitely criminal be-
havior that we saw here last week, 
there is no trust left between this ad-
ministration and the majority of the 
American people. 
The stability of our executive branch 
is a foundational piece of our democ-
racy. This administration has failed or 
refused to uphold the most basic duties 
of protecting our Constitution and our 
national security or of respecting the 
coequal branches of our government. 
Wednesday’s bloody attack proved 
that this administration is an immi-
nent and continuing danger to our 
country even in the waning days of this 
Presidency. 
I am heartbroken for our country but 
more determined than ever to fight to 
preserve our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I call on Vice President 
PENCE and the Cabinet to do the right 
thing. I call upon our colleagues to do 
the right thing: to put our country be-
fore the interests of any one man and 
to join us in ending this failed Presi-
dency. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the rule and the un-
derlying legislation. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 38 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
275) to establish the National Commission on 
the Domestic Terrorist Attack Upon the 
United States Capitol. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Homeland Security; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 275. 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on ordering the previous 
question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

resolution (H. Res. 21) calling on Vice 
President MICHAEL R. PENCE to con-
vene and mobilize the principal officers 
of the executive departments of the 
Cabinet to activate section 4 of the 
25th Amendment to declare President 
Donald J. Trump incapable of exe-
cuting the duties of his office and to 
immediately exercise powers as acting 
President, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). Pursuant to House Res-
olution 38, the amendment to the pre-
amble, printed in House Report 117–1, is 
adopted, and the resolution, as amend-
ed, is considered read. 
The text of the resolution, as amend-
ed, is as follows: 
H. RES. 21 
Whereas on Wednesday, January 6, 2021, 
the day prescribed under section 15 of title 3, 
United States Code, for the counting of elec-
toral votes, Congress experienced a massive 
violent invasion of the United States Capitol 
and its complex by a dangerous insurrec-
tionary mob which smashed windows and 
used violent physical force and weapons to 
overpower and outmaneuver the United 
States Capitol Police and facilitated the ille-
gal entry into the Capitol of hundreds, if not 
thousands, of unauthorized persons (all of 
whom entered the Capitol complex without 
going through metal detectors and other se-
curity screening devices); 
Whereas, the insurrectionary mob threat-
ened the safety and lives of the Vice Presi-
dent, the Speaker of the House, and the 
President pro tempore of the Senate, the 
first three individuals in the line of succes-
sion to the presidency, as the rioters were re-
corded chanting ‘‘Hang Mike Pence’’ and 
‘‘Where’s Nancy’’ when President Donald J. 
Trump tweeted to his supporters that ‘‘Mike 
Pence didn’t have the courage to do what 
should have been done to protect our coun-
try’’ after the Capitol had been overrun and 
the Vice President was in hiding; 
Whereas the insurrectionary mob attacked 
law enforcement officers, unleashed chaos 
and terror among Members and staffers and 
their families, occupied the Senate Chamber 
and Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office along with 
other leadership offices, vandalized and pil-
fered government property, and succeeded in 
interfering with the counting of electoral 
votes in the joint session of Congress; 
Whereas the insurrectionary mob’s violent 
attacks on law enforcement and invasion of 
the Capitol complex caused the unprece-
dented disruption of the Electoral College 
count process for a 4-hour period in both the 
House and the Senate, a dangerous and de-
stabilizing impairment of the peaceful trans-
fer of power that these insurrectionary riots 
were explicitly designed to cause; 
Whereas 5 Americans have died as a result 
of injuries or traumas suffered during this 
violent attack on Congress and the Capitol, 
including Capitol Police Officer Brian D. 
Sicknick 
and 
Ashli 
Babbitt, 
Rosanne 
Boyland, Kevin Greeson, and Benjamin Phil-
lips, and more than 50 police officers were se-
riously injured, including 15 officers who had 
to be hospitalized, by violent assaults, and 
there could easily have been dozens or hun-
dreds more wounded and killed, a sentiment 
captured by Senator Lindsey Graham, who 
observed that ‘‘the mob could have blown the 
building up. They could have killed us all’’; 
Whereas these insurrectionary protests 
were widely advertised and broadly encour-
aged by President Donald J. Trump, who re-
peatedly urged his millions of followers on 
Twitter and other social media outlets to 
come to Washington on January 6 to ‘‘Stop 
the Steal’’ of the 2020 Presidential election 
and promised his activist followers that the 
protest on the Electoral College counting 
day would be ‘‘wild’’; 
Whereas President-elect Joseph R. Biden 
won the 2020 Presidential election with more 
than 81 million votes and defeated President 
Trump 306–232 in the Electoral College, a 
margin pronounced to be a ‘‘landslide’’ by 
President Trump when he won by the same 
Electoral College numbers in 2016, but Presi-
dent Trump never accepted these election re-
sults as legitimate and waged a protracted 
campaign of propaganda and coercive pres-
sure in the Federal and State courts, in the 
state legislatures, with Secretaries of State, 
and in Congress to nullify and overturn these 
results and replace them with fraudulent and 
fabricated numbers; 
Whereas President Trump made at least 3 
attempts to intervene in the lawful vote 
counting and certification process in Georgia 
and to coerce officials there into fraudu-
lently declaring him the winner of the 
State’s electoral votes, including calls to 
Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and a State 
elections investigator, and an hour-long con-
versation with Secretary of State Brad 
Raffensperger badgering him to ‘‘find 11,780 
votes’’ and warning of a ‘‘big risk’’ to 
Raffensperger if he did not intervene favor-
ably to guarantee the reelection of President 
Trump; 
Whereas President Trump appeared with 
members of his staff and family at a 
celebratory kickoff rally to encourage and 
charge up the rioters and insurrectionists to 
‘‘walk down to the Capitol’’ and ‘‘if you don’t 
fight like hell, you’re not going to have a

country anymore’’ on Wednesday, January 6, 
2021; 
Whereas while violent insurrectionists oc-
cupied parts of the Capitol, President Trump 
ignored or rejected repeated real-time en-
treaties from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Sen-
ate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to ap-
peal to his followers to exit the Capitol, and 
also ignored a tweet from Alyssa Farah, his 
former communications director, saying: 
‘‘Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump— 
you are the only one they will listen to. For 
our country!’’; 
Whereas photographs, cell phone videos, 
social media posts, and on-the-ground re-
porting show that numerous violent insur-
rectionists who invaded the Capitol were 
armed, were carrying police grade flex cuffs 
to detain and handcuff people, used mace, 
pepper spray, and bear spray against United 
States Capitol Police officers, erected a gal-
lows on Capitol grounds to hang ‘‘traitors,’’ 
vehemently chanted ‘‘Hang Mike Pence!’’ 
while surrounding and roving the Capitol, 
emphasized that storming the Capitol was ‘‘a 
revolution,’’ brandished the Confederate bat-
tle flag inside the Capitol, and were found to 
be in possession of Napalm B, while still un-
identified culprits planted multiple pipe 
bombs at buildings near the Capitol complex, 
another lethally dangerous criminal action 
that succeeded in diverting law enforcement 
from the Capitol; and 
Whereas Donald Trump has demonstrated 
repeatedly, continuously, and spectacularly 
his absolute inability to discharge the most 
basic and fundamental powers and duties of 
his office, including most recently the duty 
to respect the legitimate results of the Presi-
dential election, the duty to respect the 
peaceful transfer of democratic power under 
the Constitution, the duty to participate in 
legally defined transition activities, the 
duty to protect and uphold the Constitution 
of the United States, including the counting 
of Electoral College votes by Congress, the 
duty to protect the people of the United 
States and their elected representatives 
against domestic insurrection, mob rule, and 
seditious violence, and generally the duty to 
take care that the laws be faithfully exe-
cuted: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives calls upon Vice President Michael R. 
Pence— 
(1) to immediately use his powers under 
section 4 of the 25th Amendment to convene 
and mobilize the principal officers of the ex-
ecutive departments in the Cabinet to de-
clare what is obvious to a horrified Nation: 
That the President is unable to successfully 
discharge the duties and powers of his office; 
and 
(2) to transmit to the President pro tem-
pore of the Senate and the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives notice that he will 
be immediately assuming the powers and du-
ties of the office as Acting President. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution, as amended, shall be debatable 
for 1 hour, equally divided and con-
trolled by the chair and ranking minor-
ity member of the Committee on the 
Judiciary or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous material 
on H. Res. 21. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 3 minutes to begin. 
Mr. Speaker, we have experienced the 
trauma of a violent attack on this 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
on 
this 
Chamber, and on all of the people who 
work here. 
An armed, lawless, and enraged mob 
smashed windows, beat up and crushed 
Capitol Hill Police officers who cried 
out in agony; overcame and subdued 
law enforcement; killed or caused the 
deaths of at least five American citi-
zens, including a heroic Capitol Hill 
Police officer, Brian Sicknick, and four 
other Americans; inflicted serious inju-
ries on dozens of our police officers and 
other people, including 15 officers who 
had to be hospitalized. 
Chanting ‘‘stop the steal’’ and ‘‘hang 
Mike Pence,’’ they threatened the lives 
and safety of the three individuals in 
the line of succession to the President 
of the United States. They built a gal-
lows right outside the Capitol. 
They screamed, ‘‘Where is Nancy?’’ 
They stormed the Speaker’s office, and 
they occupied it. They stole govern-
ment property. They trashed the place. 
They terrorized officers, staff, and 
Members. They brandished the Confed-
erate battle flag in the Capitol of the 
United States, something that didn’t 
even happen during the Civil War. 
They allowed hundreds or thousands 
of people to enter the Capitol without 
metal detectors or any kind of security 
screening at all, not only to desecrate 
the temple of democracy and to spit in 
the face of Congress but actually to 
interfere with the counting of electoral 
college votes in the 2020 Presidential 
election. 
They may have been looking for Vice 
President PENCE and Speaker PELOSI, 
but every person in this room could 
have 
died. 
As 
a 
shaken 
Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM said, ‘‘The mob could 
have blown the building up. They could 
have killed us all.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, whether or not you be-
lieve the President’s course of conduct 
in encouraging, building, summoning, 
assembling, and inflaming the mob— 
lighting the flame, as Congresswoman 
LIZ CHENEY put it in a very powerful 
and cogent statement this evening— 
whether you believe that that was a 
high crime and misdemeanor, an of-
fense against the Republic, that is a 
question for another time. And to put 
my cards on the table, I think it was a 
crime against the Republic. 
But leaving that aside, I think every 
Member in this body should be able to 
agree that this President is not meet-
ing the most minimal duties of office. 
He is not meeting the oath that he 
swore, to uphold and defend the Con-
stitution against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic. He is not protecting and 
defending the democracy itself, the 
process of electing the President. He is 
not respecting the peaceful transfer of 
power. He is not taking care that the 
laws are faithfully executed. He is not 
protecting the Republic against mob 
insurrection, invasion, and hostility. 
He is not protecting the republican 
form of government for the people of 
the United States when he allowed this 
to happen. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution is sim-
ply asking Vice President PENCE to ex-
ercise 
his 
powers 
under 
the 
25th 
Amendment of the Constitution, sec-
tion 4, to convene the Cabinet and to 
mobilize the Cabinet to state and ar-
ticulate what is obvious to the Amer-
ican 
people—this 
President 
is 
not 
meeting the duties of office and is 
clearly not capable of it—and to trans-
fer the powers to the Vice President 
under the 25th Amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from the 
great State of California (Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK). 
Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
what a sad and ominous way to begin 
the 117th Congress. Hasn’t this body 
done enough in the last session to di-
vide our country and abuse our Con-
stitution without carrying that dam-
age into the new session? 
The 25th Amendment specifically ad-
dresses the incapacity of the President 
to discharge the duties of his office. It 
was never intended as a political weap-
on when Congress doesn’t like the way 
he discharges those duties. 
Now, I have read that speech. He 
never suggested rampaging the Capitol 
and disrupting the Congress. He urged 
them to—and this is an exact quote— 
‘‘peacefully and patriotically make 
your voices heard.’’ 
Now, many of us Republicans joined 
a bipartisan vote to respect the elec-
toral college votes despite our sus-
picions, our misgivings, and our de-
sires. We did this because the Constitu-
tion commanded it and our institutions 
depend on it. Now, today, those same 
principles should compel a bipartisan 
vote to oppose this grotesque abuse of 
the 25th Amendment. 
Last week, the majority argued that 
the President tried to misuse the Con-
stitution to overturn the votes of the 
electoral college. Well, he asserted no 
direct power. Rather, he urged the Vice 
President and Congress to do so. Many 
of us declined his bad advice. 
Yet, this week, the majority directly 
is asserting power to misuse the 25th 
Amendment in a manner that does 
overturn the votes of the previous elec-
toral college. Don’t they see that they 
are committing directly the same of-
fense they accuse the President of com-
mitting indirectly? 
Every act we take builds a precedent 
for future acts. Once Congress asserts

this new role as armchair psychiatrists 
and a new power to equate intemperate 
speech with functional disability, the 
most important pillars of our govern-
ment—stability, the rule of law, and 
the separation of powers—will fracture. 
It won’t affect this President, but it 
will stalk future Presidents from this 
day forward. For their sake, please 
don’t do this. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and applaud 
him and salute him as a constitutional 
scholar, an intellectual resource, and 
the force of justice that he has been as 
he has crafted and advanced this reso-
lution. 
I thank the entire House Democratic 
Caucus for their love of country, deter-
mination to protect our democracy, 
and the loyalty to our oath that had 
been so beautifully manifested in this 
dark past week. 
Mr. Speaker, a dark week it has been 
indeed. On Wednesday, the President of 
the United States incited a deadly in-
surrection against America that tar-
geted the very heart of our democracy, 
this temple of democracy, the United 
States Capitol, defiling the genius of 
the Constitution—separate but equal— 
attacking the first branch of govern-
ment, trying to prevent us from car-
rying out our constitutional duty to 
ascertain that Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS
will be President and Vice 
President of the United States. 
The gleeful desecration of the Capitol 
and the violence against Congress, our 
staff, and our workers are horrors that 
will forever stain our Nation’s history. 
Five Americans have died following the 
violent attack. More than 50 police of-
ficers were seriously injured, including 
15 officers who were hospitalized. 
On behalf of the House, I salute and 
express deepest gratitude to the U.S. 
Capitol Police for the valor that they 
showed in protecting the lives of Mem-
bers, especially protecting our staff 
and those who make Congress function. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a sad day for our 
country, that we have to come to the 
floor in a way to defend the Constitu-
tion of the United States at this time. 
The facts are very clear: The Presi-
dent called for this seditious attack. 
For days, he urged supporters to come 
to Washington for the insurrection. 
Wednesday morning, he participated in 
a rally to encourage the rioters to 
march on the Capitol and fight. 
Not only did he urge people to march 
on the Capitol and fight, he further 
fanned the flames, and he and his fam-
ily cheered and celebrated the desecra-
tion of the Capitol. 
Later that day, as the dangers esca-
lated, he ignored and then flat-out re-
jected the pleas of Congress, including 
those of his own party, to call off his 
supporters—the 
rioters, 
the 
terror-
ists—as they engaged in vandalism and 
violence. 
Now, the President is saying that he 
is not responsible and that his incite-
ment to violence was totally appro-
priate. 
The President’s actions demonstrate 
his absolute inability to discharge the 
most basic and fundamental powers 
and duties of his office. Therefore, the 
President must be removed from office 
immediately. 
This is a decision we make with the 
utmost solemnity and prayerfulness 
which this crisis requires. Removal of 
the President is an unprecedented ac-
tion, but it is required because it is an 
unprecedented moment in history be-
cause of the danger that he poses. 
I heard the previous speaker say that 
we are objecting to the President be-
cause we don’t like the way he exe-
cutes his duties. No, we don’t like it at 
all: acts of sedition, incitement to in-
surrection, treasonous activity. If you 
are associating yourself with that as 
the proper execution of the President’s 
duties, then you are associating your-
self with sedition and treason. 
Yesterday, in a pro forma session, we 
introduced a unanimous consent re-
quest to take up Congressman RASKIN’s 
legislation, which calls on the Vice 
President to mobilize the Cabinet to 
activate the 25th Amendment to re-
move the President from office, again, 
to prevent him from causing more 
damage to our country. Who knows 
what he might do next? 
But House Republicans rejected this 
legislation. So the President’s un-
hinged, unstable, deranged acts of sedi-
tion may continue, endangering Amer-
ica and undermining our democracy. 
Now we are taking up this legislation 
in regular session. After passage, we 
are calling on the Vice President to re-
spond within 24 hours of passage. This 
resolution gives House Republicans the 
clear choice to honor the oath of office, 
to defend our democracy, and to uphold 
the sacred trust given to us by the Con-
stitution and by those whom we rep-
resent. 
Mr. Speaker, during the Trump Pres-
idency, these 4 years, and especially 
during this sad time, I recall the words 
of the great Israeli poet Ehud Manor 
when he said: 
I can’t keep silent in light of 
How my country’s changed her face 
Won’t quit trying to remind her 
In her ears, I’ll sing my cries 
Until she opens her eyes. 
‘‘I can’t keep silent in light of how my coun-
try’s changed her face.’’ I urge my Re-
publican colleagues to open their eyes 
and to finally hold this President ac-
countable. The security of our country 
and the future of our very democracy 
are at stake. 
When we pray for God to bless Amer-
ica, let us hope that that blessing 
comes down strongly on us in the next 
few days. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I applaud the 
great leadership of Mr. RASKIN. 
b 2130 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in opposition to H. Res. 21, calling on 
Vice President PENCE to invoke section 
4 of the 25th Amendment. 
Like all of us, I condemn, in the 
strongest possible terms, the violence 
that occurred here in our Nation’s Cap-
ital last week. Political violence is 
never the answer, regardless of which 
side of the political spectrum it occurs. 
And that is a strongly held position on 
which I have been clear since well be-
fore my time in Congress. 
Let’s be clear about a few things. The 
adoption of this political resolution 
would be divisive rather than unifying. 
The Vice President has said he has no 
intention of taking action under the 
amendment. So, this process is pure po-
litical theater on the part of the major-
ity. 
In addition, no due process has been 
provided. As a former prosecutor, if law 
enforcement brought evidence of a 
crime to me and said take this to the 
jury tomorrow for a jury trial, there 
would be no chance for the defendant 
to prepare any defense. I would be vio-
lating half the Constitution, the code 
of Virginia, and over 100 different rules 
of procedure. 
In the more than 50 years since the 
25th Amendment was ratified, section 4 
has never been invoked. As such, there 
are no judicial or authoritative opin-
ions that would evaluate its implemen-
tation. Absent this, we must look to 
the legislative intent of the Congress 
that passed its language, and nowhere 
in the legislative intent is the current 
situation envisioned. It is meant to be 
used for incapacity, not for political 
ends with 8 days remaining in a Presi-
dent’s term. 
Last week, Vice President PENCE was 
lauded by the majority for not yielding 
to pressure to exert power beyond his 
constitutional authority to determine 
the outcome of the election. Yet, the 
majority today is attempting to pres-
sure him to exert power beyond the in-
tention of his constitutional role in 
section 4 of the 25th Amendment. 
This action will only further fuel the 
political divide among our citizens and 
will be detrimental to the long-term ef-
forts to unify our country. 
Mr. Speaker, both President Trump 
and President-elect Biden have called 
for a peaceful transition of power. I 
would encourage members of both par-
ties to work toward this end and vote 
against this rushed, misguided, politi-
cally motivated resolution. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, last 
week, as we counted electoral college 
votes, I said this day marks a cross-
roads for our American democracy. We 
didn’t know then what an ominous 
statement that was. We do now. 
Congress was attacked by a violent 
mob, incited by the President, to stop 
us from doing our constitutional job. 
The President not only encouraged the 
mob; he said he loved them and made 
no serious effort to stop them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H136 
January 12, 2021 
Lives were lost and put in danger. 
Constitutional 
government 
was 
ur-
gently threatened. The President’s ac-
tions were not only wrong; they were 
dangerous. 
He lives in an alternate reality. He is 
a continuing threat to America. 
Vice President PENCE should invoke 
the 25th Amendment, assume Presi-
dential duties until the inauguration 
next week, and save us from a Presi-
dent who is unable to function, unable 
to protect our country. 
I urge all, including my Republican 
colleagues, to put politics aside. Act to 
secure the safety of our country. We 
truly are at a crossroads for our Amer-
ican democracy. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, the vio-
lence at the Capitol last week has been 
condemned by Republicans, Democrats, 
and President Trump. So, I wonder: 
Why are the Democrats stoking the 
fire instead of dousing the flames? 
This 25th Amendment resolution is 
actually 
similar, 
with 
some 
dif-
ferences, to the proposal filed in Octo-
ber of this year by the same Represent-
ative and joined by 42 Democrats. The 
problem at that time is they were try-
ing to get this commission together. 
This time, they want the Vice Presi-
dent to invoke the other portion of ar-
ticle 4. But the problem, of course, is 
that the Vice President sent a very 
lovely letter to them, saying he is not 
going to do that. 
Our Nation is divided. While folks on 
the left are trying to lay this all on 
President Trump, you should consider 
a 
few 
statements 
from 
colleagues 
across the aisle. 
One of our colleagues at one point 
said: ‘‘If you see anybody from that 
Cabinet,’’ meaning Mr. Trump’s Cabi-
net, ‘‘in a restaurant, in a department 
store, at a gasoline station, you get out 
and you create a crowd. And you push 
back on them, and you tell them they 
are not welcome anymore, anywhere.’’ 
Senator BOOKER called for his sup-
porters to: ‘‘Go to the Hill today. Get 
up and please get up in the face of some 
Congresspeople.’’ 
I have dozens more similar state-
ments. But what we are talking about 
here today is a resolution, asking the 
Vice President to invoke the 25th 
Amendment and get the Cabinet to-
gether to remove this President. 
What that does, it is basically doing 
what Democrats wrongfully claimed 
President Trump did on January 6. It 
pours gas on the smoldering embers, 
which consist of tens of millions who 
believe the integrity of the election 
was questionable. They feel disenfran-
chised. And quite frankly, they are 
more angry than aggrieved. 
Some believe that by doing this, it is 
going to be healing. I heard this gen-
tleman say this in the Rules Com-
mittee, that doing this would be heal-
ing. Yet, the Vice President said he is 
not going to do that. If this resolution 
is to ask the Vice President to invoke 
this 25th Amendment, if this is what 
the purpose of this is, to ask the Vice 
President, then the purpose is now 
null. 
But I suggest to you it looks like, it 
would appear like, if we are going to 
proceed on, even after you received the 
answer that you are seeking, and it is 
disapprobation of your idea, that the 
only thing that could be left is to pour 
gas on the fire. 
I am asking that cooler heads prevail 
here. This is not necessary. Don’t let 
this get in the way. Just to parrot the 
last speaker, I am asking friends across 
the aisle: Don’t do this. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the gen-
tleman reasonably poses the question: 
Why are we doing this? 
We think that the President of the 
United States constitutes a clear and 
present danger to the Republic and to 
our people. 
For example, on the white suprema-
cist websites that helped to build the 
President’s mob, they are now calling 
for a return engagement on the days of 
January 19 and 20. They are calling 
again for an attack on the Capitol, and 
they are calling again for the State 
legislatures, now in 50 States, to be 
surrounded. 
What will the attitude be of the 
President of the United States? Will he 
give them aid and comfort? Will he 
wink at them? Will he send them posi-
tive tweets and messages, calling them 
patriots? 
Also, on extreme rightwing websites, 
they are calling for the President to 
pardon the organizers of the armed vio-
lent insurrection that took place in 
this body not even a week ago. What if 
the President decides to pardon them? 
We know this President is not living 
up to the most minimal duties of his 
office. That is why we are doing this, 
to protect the public. 
By the way, we are not telling the 
Vice President what he must do. We 
have no authority to do that. We are 
telling him what we think he should do 
and that the Congress will be with him 
because we know that he has come 
under extreme rightwing pressure on 
everything from the counting of the 
electoral college votes to his positions 
on a whole range of things to go along 
with Donald Trump. So, we are trying 
to counterbalance that attack on him 
from the right to say the people want 
to see a peaceful way through this. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Accountability 
comes 
before 
healing, 
but 
healing 
should come. 
If we look at the Constitution, we 
will clearly see that Mr. RASKIN’s reso-
lution fits the language: an inability to 
be able to discharge your duties, to ex-
ercise the laws carefully. 
Do you consider these words from the 
President of the United States to in-
surrectionists and terrorists to ‘‘walk 
down to the Capitol,’’ says the Presi-
dent, telling them: ‘‘If you don’t fight 
like hell, you are not going to have a 
country anymore.’’ And that is the at-
tack that the domestic terrorists made 
on this place. 
All we are asking of the Vice Presi-
dent, through this resolution, is to re-
flect on that and to call upon the 25th 
Amendment to convene the Cabinet, to 
begin the healing, because the Presi-
dent of the United States is dangerous 
to the American people. 
That is why we are on the floor 
today. We hope that he will have an op-
portunity to reflect because the Con-
stitution says in many places that the 
actions of this President are dan-
gerous. 
People have died. We have lost two 
police officers. Others are in the hos-
pital. And yes, it was an insurrection. 
It is time to pass H. Res. 21. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, I rise in strong support of H. 
Res. 21, a resolution calling on Vice President 
MICHAEL R. PENCE to convene and mobilize 
the principal officers of the executive depart-
ments of the Cabinet to activate Section 4 of 
the 25th Amendment to declare President 
Donald J. Trump incapable of executing the 
duties of his office and to immediately exer-
cise powers as acting President. 
As a person who was in the House cham-
ber, that day and witnessed the terror, may-
hem, and horror unleashed by the President’s 
incitement of insurrection and utter betrayal of 
his sacred oath, it is manifestly evident that 
the President is clearly incapable, and cer-
tainly unwilling, of exercising the duties of his 
office, which makes it essential for Vice-Presi-
dent PENCE to convene the principal officers of 
the Executive Branch to invoke the 25th 
Amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, the resolution recites a tale of 
abdication and dereliction of duty by a Presi-
dent of the United States unseen in the history 
of our country. 
On Wednesday, January 6, 2021, the day 
prescribed by section 15 of title 3, United 
States Code, for the counting of electoral 
votes, Congress experienced a massive, vio-
lent invasion of the United States Capitol and 
its complex by a dangerous insurrectionary 
mob, which smashed windows and used vio-
lent, physical force and weapons to overpower 
and outmaneuver the United States Capitol 
Police and facilitated the illegal entry into the 
Capitol of hundreds, if not thousands, of unau-
thorized persons (all of whom entered the 
Capitol complex without going through metal 
detectors and other security screening de-
vices). 
This insurrectionary mob threatened the 
safety and lives of the Vice President, the 
Speaker of the House, and the President pro 
tempore of the Senate, the first three individ-
uals in the line of succession to the presi-
dency, as the rioters were recorded chanting 
‘‘Hang Mike Pence’’ and ‘‘Where’s Nancy’’ 
when President Donald J. Trump tweeted to 
his supporters that ‘‘Mike Pence didn’t have 
the courage to do what should have been 
done to protect our country.’ 
The marauders attacked law enforcement 
officers, unleashed chaos and terror among 
Members and staffers and their families, occu-
pied the Senate Chamber and Speaker NANCY 
PELOSI’s office along with other leadership of-
fices, vandalized and pilfered government

January 12, 2021 
property, and succeeded in causing the un-
precedented disruption of the Electoral Col-
lege count process for a 4–hour period in both 
the House and the Senate, a dangerous and 
destabilizing impairment of the peaceful trans-
fer of power that these insurrectionary riots 
were explicitly designed to cause. 
At least five Americans have died as a re-
sult of injuries or traumas suffered during this 
violent attack on Congress, including Capitol 
Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick, and more 
than 50 police officers were seriously injured, 
including 15 officers who had to be hospital-
ized by these violent assaults. 
There could easily have been hundreds 
more wounded and killed, a sentiment cap-
tured by Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM, one of the 
President’s fiercest enablers, who observed 
that ‘‘the mob could have blown the building 
up. They could have killed us all.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, these insurrectionary protests 
were widely advertised and broadly encour-
aged by the current President, who repeatedly 
disgraced his high office by exhorting his mil-
lions of followers on Twitter and other social 
media outlets to come to Washington on Janu-
ary 6 to ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ of the 2020 Presi-
dential election, promising that the protest on 
the Electoral College counting day would be 
‘‘wild.’’ 
Although President-elect Joseph R. Biden 
decisively won the 2020 Presidential election 
with more than 81 million votes and defeated 
President Trump 306–232 in the Electoral Col-
lege, a margin pronounced to be a ‘‘landslide’ 
by the current President Trump when he won 
by the same Electoral College numbers in 
2016, the current and temporary occupant of 
the White House never accepted these elec-
tion results as legitimate and waged a pro-
tracted campaign of propaganda and coercive 
pressure in the Federal and State courts, in 
the state legislatures, with Secretaries of 
State, and in Congress to nullify and overturn 
these results and replace them with imaginary 
and fabricated numbers to maintain his con-
tinuance in office. 
This culminated in the current President tak-
ing the stage at the insurrection rally he held 
on the Ellipse Grounds on January 6, 2021 to 
exhort the rioters and insurrectionists to ‘‘walk 
down to the Capitol,’’ telling them ‘‘if you don’t 
fight like hell, you’re not going to have a coun-
try anymore.’ 
The 
President’s 
putative 
lawyer, 
Rudy 
Giuliani, who possesses the uncanny knack of 
surfacing to make things worse whenever the 
President is acting to undermine American de-
mocracy, warned the mob to expect ‘‘trial by 
combat.’’ 
While domestic terrorists occupied parts of 
the Capitol, the person currently occupying the 
office of President of the United States, ig-
nored or rejected repeated real-time entreaties 
from the Speaker of the House and the Demo-
cratic Leader of the U.S. Senate to appeal to 
his followers to exit the Capitol. 
Mr. Speaker, photographs, cell phone vid-
eos, social media posts, and on-the-ground re-
porting show that numerous violent insurrec-
tionists who invaded the Capitol were armed, 
carrying police grade flex cuffs to detain and 
handcuff people, used mace, pepper spray, 
and bear spray against United States Capitol 
Police officers, erected gallows on Capitol 
grounds 
to 
hang 
‘‘traitors,’’ 
vehemently 
chanted ‘‘Hang Mike Pence’’ while roaming 
the Capitol, emphasizing that storming the 
Capitol was ‘‘a revolution,’’ and committed the 
unspeakable offense of brandishing the Con-
federate battle flag inside the Capitol. 
In all of this, Donald John Trump has dem-
onstrated repeatedly, continuously, and spec-
tacularly his absolute inability to discharge the 
most basic and fundamental powers and du-
ties of his office, including most recently the 
duty to respect the legitimate results of the 
Presidential election and the duty to respect 
the peaceful transfer of democratic power 
under the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, Donald John Trump has acted 
in a manner contrary to his trust as President 
and subversive of constitutional government, 
to the great prejudice of the cause of law and 
justice, and to the manifest injury of the peo-
ple of the United States. 
For the safety and security of the people of 
the United States and the survival of our de-
mocracy, he must be removed from office. 
For these reasons, I urge all Members to 
join me in voting for H. Res. 21, calling upon 
the Vice-President to convene the Cabinet and 
to invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion and assume the powers and duties of the 
office as Acting President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Geor-
gia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I would like to quote the President 
of the United States: ‘‘I know that ev-
eryone here will soon be marching over 
to the Capitol Building to peacefully 
and patriotically make your voices 
heard.’’ 
‘‘Go home with love and in peace. Re-
member this day forever.’’—President 
Donald Trump. 
I condemn this violence. Republicans 
have condemned this violence. Presi-
dent Trump has condemned this vio-
lence. But elected Democrats over the 
past year have promoted violence, have 
supported it. They fund it on their 
ActBlue fundraising platform. 
There has been billions in damage 
caused over this past year, riots all 
over this country. Do you know how 
many companies have endured violence 
and destruction? I have 83 pages here of 
businesses that had property damage, 
were burned, through the Minnesota 
riots. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article about the Minnesota riots. 
[From the Star Tribune, July 31, 2020] 
BUILDINGS DAMAGED IN MINNEAPOLIS, ST. 
PAUL AFTER RIOTS 
(By Josh Penrod, C.J. Sinner and Mary Jo 
Webster) 
TWIN CITIES RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL STORES 
WERE HIT THE HARDEST IN THE RIOTING FOL-
LOWING GEORGE FLOYD’S KILLING 
In the first few days after George Floyd 
was killed by Minneapolis police, rioters tore 
through dense stretches of Minneapolis, St. 
Paul and other metro communities in retal-
iation, causing millions in property damage 
to more than 1,500 locations. 
In their wake, vandals left a trail of 
smashed doors and windows, covered hun-
dreds of boarded-up businesses with graffiti 
and set fire to nearly 150 buildings, with doz-
ens burned to the ground. Pharmacies, gro-
ceries, liquor stores, tobacco shops and cell 
phone stores were ransacked, losing thou-
sands of dollars in stolen merchandise. Many 
were looted repeatedly over consecutive 
nights. 
Other property—like gas stations, res-
taurants and even parked cars—was set on 
fire, with much of it completely destroyed. 
The full extent of damage to Twin Cities 
buildings—including 
residences, 
churches, 
nonprofits and minority-owned businesses— 
could take weeks or months to calculate. Al-
ready on the ropes from months of lost rev-
enue during a global pandemic, some busi-
nesses may never reopen as others are still 
temporarily or indefinitely closed. 
Buildings along a 5–mile stretch of Lake 
Street in Minneapolis and a 3.5–mile stretch 
of University Avenue in St. Paul’s Midway 
area experienced some of the heaviest dam-
age. While this is an incomplete list, here’s a 
look at some of those hardest-hit areas. 
HEAVY DAMAGE NEAR MINNEAPOLIS POLICE 
PRECINCTS 
For three consecutive nights starting on 
Wednesday, May 27, rioters pummeled blocks 
worth of buildings near the Minneapolis’ 
Third and Fifth police precincts, inflicting 
heavy damage. 
On Thursday night, protesters torched and 
heavily vandalized the Third Precinct, and 
destroyed at least 20 nearby buildings, in-
cluding several restaurants, an Auto Zone, 
Minnehaha Lake Wine & Spirits, a U.S. Post 
Office, a cellphone store and the building 
that housed Talk Town Diner, El Nuevo 
Rodeo and others. Midtown Corner, a multi- 
story affordable housing project that was 
still under construction, erupted into a tow-
ering inferno, burning so hot that it melted 
siding off a nearby house. 
The following night, about three miles 
west 
of 
the 
Third 
Precinct, 
protesters 
blanketed the area near the Fifth Precinct, 
heavily damaging at least seven buildings— 
including a U.S. Post Office, a Wells Fargo 
branch, a staffing agency and a Subway in a 
nearby strip mall. Authorities also reported 
that shots had been fired at officers in the 
Fifth Precinct area, but there were no re-
ports of injuries. 
FIRES NEAR MIDTOWN GLOBAL MARKET, HEAVY 
LOOTING IN UPTOWN 
The Midtown Global Market area experi-
enced one of the most concentrated tolls dur-
ing the Floyd riots. More than a dozen busi-
nesses near E. Lake Street and Chicago Ave-
nue were destroyed by fire, and a few dozen 
more reported fire damage with many being 
burned severely. 
Less than two miles to the west near Hen-
nepin Avenue and W. Lake Street, nearly 40 
businesses were broken into or heavily 
looted, including large retailers like H&M, 
Timberland, an Apple store, Kitchen Window 
and Urban Outfitters. Just a few blocks away 
near Lyndale Avenue and W. Lake Street, a 
cluster of nearly 30 businesses sustained 
property damage, including several res-
taurants and bars. There was almost no fire 
damage in this area, a stark contrast to 
other clusters along Lake Street. 
MILES OF DAMAGE ALONG UNIVERSITY AVENUE 
Across the river in St. Paul, the hardest- 
hit area was a 1–mile stretch of the Midway 
along University Avenue between Snelling 
and Lexington Avenues, although damage 
extended a few miles, stopping just short of 
the State Capitol. In all, more than 70 busi-
nesses were hit, with more than a dozen sus-
taining serious fire damage. 
TWIN CITIES SURROUNDING AREA 
Rioters hit buildings well beyond Min-
neapolis and St. Paul, with damage reported 
as far north as Blaine and as far south as 
Apple Valley. Meanwhile, clusters of at-
tacked storefronts sprang up in places like 
Richfield, 
North 
St. 
Paul, 
Maplewood, 
Brooklyn Center and Roseville:

4:34 p.m. 6/1/20 Sprout Social 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, we should not be hypocrites. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am hon-
ored to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise as a 
proud American who has the distinct 
honor of serving this great body. 
As a Member of Congress, we take an 
oath to defend the Constitution be-
cause at times it needs defending. 
On January 6, the Nation watched as 
insurrectionists stormed the Capitol, 
threatened the safety of countless indi-
viduals, and successfully, albeit it tem-
porarily, disrupted our process. 
In the midst of the attack, hundreds 
of Capitol Police officers heroically 
upheld their duty to defend the United 
States and protect those who work 
here. Many officers were severely in-
jured and beaten, including one of my 
former interns. 
Tragically, one officer, Officer Brian 
Sicknick, succumbed to the injuries he 
sustained. 
To Officer Sicknick’s family, I ex-
tend my deepest condolences. Know 
that we are praying for you. 
To all Capitol Police officers, we are 
deeply thankful for your bravery. Be-
cause of you, thousands of lives were 
protected, and the people’s work was 
able to resume. 
Now, just as the Capitol Police pro-
tected us, Congress must match that 
courage and protect the Constitution, 
our democratic processes, and this Na-
tion. 
The President’s role in the insurrec-
tion is undeniable. Both on social 
media ahead of January 6 and in his 
speech that day, he deliberately pro-
moted baseless theories, creating a 
combustible 
environment 
of 
misin-
formation and division. 
To allow the President of the United 
States to incite this attack without 
consequences is a direct threat to the 
future of this democracy. For this rea-
son, I will vote to impeach this Presi-
dent tomorrow. 
The bill before us tonight is a non-
binding resolution, which requests the 
Vice President to invoke the 25th 
Amendment, a step he has already said 
he will not take. It is merely a sym-
bolic gesture, and I will oppose that 
resolution. 
After last week’s attack on the Cap-
itol, it is clear our Nation is more di-
vided than ever in recent history. We 
began this great experiment over 240 
years ago. To preserve it, we must re-
member that our faith, race, or polit-
ical party is not what unites us. What 
unites us is that we are Americans. I 
would encourage members of this body, 
and everyone at home, to remember 
that simple truth. 
b 2145 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Two questions, as we begin another 
24 hours that will deepen the wounds of 
the country and the disaffection among 
Americans: 
First, will you stop at nothing? 
Second, is there any hypocrisy too 
far? 
Let’s call this what it is: An ulti-
matum, an attempt to intimidate and 
bully Vice President PENCE. They are 
not seeking just the same ends as the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK) said, they employ the 
same means. They seek to bully the 
Vice President to abuse power under 
the 25th Amendment, intended to pro-
vide for temporary or sudden inca-
pacity of the President while they 
claim to be scandalized about the 
President bullying the Vice President 
one week ago to abuse power under the 
12th Amendment. 
With all due respect for the gen-
tleman from Maryland, he has not an-
swered: Why are you doing this now? 
Tonight, the Vice President has 
clarified in a letter sent to all of us at 
7:34 p.m. that this resolution has abso-
lutely no other purpose. Here are three 
key things he said: ‘‘I urge you and 
every Member of Congress to avoid ac-
tions that would further divide and in-
flame the passions of the moment. 
Work with us to lower the temperature 
and unite our country. . . . ‘’ 
Quote: ‘‘As you know full well, the 
25th Amendment was designed to ad-
dress Presidential incapacity or dis-
ability.’’ 
Quote: ‘‘Under our Constitution, the 
25th Amendment is not a means of pun-
ishment or usurpation.’’ 
And listen to this one carefully: 
‘‘Last week, I did not yield to pressure 
to exert power beyond my constitu-
tional authority . . . , and I will not 
now yield to efforts in the House of 
Representatives 
to 
play 
political 
games at a time so serious in the life of 
our Nation.’’ 
The Vice President has given you 
your answer before you ask the ques-
tion. No legitimate purpose to this res-
olution remains. Your ultimatum does 
violence to a core feature of the archi-
tecture of the Constitution. The Fram-
ers were emphatic about their purpose 
to avoid making the President a crea-
ture of Congress. The 25th Amendment 
was not ratified to change that, as you 
well know. Please do not pervert this 
important protection to undermine the 
Constitution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind Members that re-
marks in debate must be addressed to 
the Chair and not to others in the sec-
ond person. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
Last Wednesday, I came to these hal-
lowed Halls where I serve to watch the 
electoral college ratify and certify the 
election of Joe Biden in what was a 
fair, transparent election, which 61 
courts had looked into, and all said it 
was fine. I was sitting right up there in 
the gallery when a Capitol Policeman 
came in and said: We are locking the 
doors. We are locking the doors. 
And within only minutes of that, I 
heard the rabble knocking on the door, 
trying to knock it down. We were then 
told to put on our gas masks and to 
evacuate, and we all did it. 
This was an assault on the Constitu-
tion, an assault on Congress. It was a 
felonious assault. It was an attempt to 
murder the Congress and our processes 
to elect our President of the United 
States. It is the political equivalent of 
shooting somebody on Fifth Avenue 
and getting away with it. 
Somebody needs to stand up to that, 
and the 25th Amendment is one way to 
do it, whether Republicans can purge 
themselves of their own creation who 
has damaged this country. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. COHEN. I ask us to pass this res-
olution, bring this country together, 
and get rid of this cancer. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
is an absurd resolution callously politi-
cizing an unpredictable tragedy last 
week. We all know that President 
Trump called for a peaceful and patri-
otic march. I must have attended a half 
dozen Trump rallies in the past year, 
and they have always been peaceful, 
wholesome events, typical of the thou-
sands of peaceful protesters who re-
mained away from the Capitol last 
week. I never would have expected this 
in a million years. 
This is a horrible event, but not like 
the Black Lives Matter, antifa events 
that went on day after day in city after 
city, with prominent Democrats fan-
ning the flames by mischaracterizing 
police shootings or apparently encour-
aging bail for lawbreakers. 
Less than 2 years ago, a Member of 
this body encouraged harassment of 
Trump officers at restaurants, gas sta-
tions, or department stores. And what 
happened? She was rewarded with the 
chairmanship of an ‘‘A’’ committee. 
Even in last week’s riots, the Speak-
er tried to preposterously racialize 
them, which can only lead to trouble, 
maybe violence. Everybody back home 
says we ought to get along. 
Is this the way to start things? 
It is time to get back to dealing with 
the people’s business, dealing with the 
cancel culture.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H139 
January 12, 2021 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, for 244 years, America has stood as 
the world’s bellwether of democracy. 
Last week, the world saw America at 
perhaps her lowest moment. It was 
crazy. We all took the same oath when 
we swore to protect this country from 
enemies, both foreign and domestic; 
and now with a domestic enemy having 
arisen that is crazy, only the Vice 
President has the power to invoke the 
25th Amendment and protect this coun-
try from this domestic enemy. 
The 25th Amendment was written for 
this moment. If not now, when would 
its use ever be appropriate? 
Vice President PENCE, you have an 
opportunity to put country before self 
by implementing the 25th Amendment. 
Please muster the courage to protect 
America from maniacal behavior that 
threatens the very foundations of our 
democracy. Stop the violence, Mr. Vice 
President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, what hap-
pened last Wednesday at the Capitol 
never should have happened. The ac-
tions of those who attempted to breach 
the Capitol Building, and then ulti-
mately did, are inexcusable. Lawless-
ness and violence are never acceptable, 
whichever side of the political divide 
one may fall. Those who broke the law 
should be and will be identified and 
prosecuted. 
In the aftermath of last week’s tragic 
events, most Americans continue to be 
saddened, angry, and wanting answers, 
and they are looking to us to provide a 
positive example of how to bring our 
Nation back together. Unfortunately, 
if what we are doing this evening is 
any indication, Congress might not be 
up to the task. 
The Democrats’ attempt to invoke 
the 25th Amendment and to once again 
impeach President Trump a week be-
fore he will be leaving office anyway 
are, in my opinion, misguided. The 
push to encourage the Vice President 
to invoke the 25th Amendment is espe-
cially ill advised. 
The Constitution is clear that the 
role for Congress to play under the 25th 
Amendment is to decide if the powers 
provided thereunder have been properly 
invoked in the event of a dispute be-
tween the President and Vice President 
or the majority of the Cabinet. In other 
words, we are to serve as judges under 
the 25th Amendment, not instigators. 
By encouraging the Vice President to 
take action, supporters of this resolu-
tion are abandoning our constitutional 
role, which could have a significant 
legal consequence down the road. And 
even more importantly, rather than 
help to heal a divided nation, the 
Democrats’ effort will likely drive us 
even further apart. 
Instead, Mr. Speaker, we should be 
turning our attention toward uniting 
the American people. It is time for us 
to tone down the political rhetoric, to 
work together, to solve the problems 
that face our Nation. It is time for us 
to put aside our differences and find 
common ground. After all, we are all 
Americans. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. SWALWELL). 
Mr. SWALWELL. On January 6th, 
Donald Trump incited radicalized ter-
rorists to attack the Capitol to stop 
the counting of electoral ballots. Don-
ald Trump won’t protect life and can-
not uphold our Constitution, so we 
must do so today. 
It is time for our country to unite, 
but unity in a national crisis starts 
with accountability, and that starts 
here in the people’s House. So let’s 
unite against the violence incited by 
Donald Trump to stop a peaceful tran-
sition of power, and unite for the safe-
ty of all Americans. Let’s unite against 
a President whose hate speech led to 
the death of a law enforcement officer, 
and unite for the cops, the military 
who bravely defended the Capitol. Let’s 
unite against Donald Trump, who in-
spired terrorists to carry a Confederate 
flag into this Capitol, display a noose, 
and desecrate the people’s House. And 
let’s unite for the custodial staff, large-
ly people of color, who cleaned up after 
those 
White 
supremacists, 
because 
they still believe in this democracy, as 
imperfect as it was that day. 
The most essential function of a 
President is to protect life and defend 
liberty. Donald Trump has failed to do 
that and is failing to do that. So Vice 
President PENCE must invoke the 25th 
Amendment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time each side has re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 161⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Mary-
land has 163⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. STEUBE). 
Mr. STEUBE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
be remiss if I didn’t address the atroc-
ities occurring right here on the House 
floor today. A week ago, this building 
was attacked; and instead of working 
with Republicans to attempt to pre-
vent that from ever happening again, 
the Speaker and her Democratic col-
leagues think an appropriate response 
is to prevent Members from exercising 
their Second Amendment constitu-
tional rights in the very place that 
wasn’t secure a week ago. 
This attack didn’t come from the in-
side. It came from the outside. And to 
respond by restricting Members’ Sec-
ond Amendment rights in the very in-
stitution that is supposed to uphold 
those rights is appalling. 
Take note, America. This is what you 
have to look forward to in a Joe Biden 
administration. If they can do it right 
here in the people’s House, they will 
attempt to do it across the country. 
The plain language of the 25th 
Amendment is abundantly clear. Al-
though I am an attorney, you don’t 
have to be an attorney to understand 
that the Vice President is the principal 
required to invoke the amendment. 
The beginning of Section 4 states: 
‘‘Whenever the Vice President and a 
majority of either principal officers of 
the executive departments or of such 
other body as Congress may by law 
provide . . . declare that the President 
is unable to discharge. . . . ’’ 
You must have the Vice President in-
voking this, and you don’t. The Vice 
President has been clear, he is unwill-
ing to invoke the 25th Amendment. It 
is not Congress’ role to override him. It 
doesn’t state in the amendment that 
Congress makes that determination. 
The Vice President does. 
But my Democratic colleagues will 
stop at nothing to remove this Presi-
dent, even a week before his term ex-
pires. The plain reading of the 25th 
Amendment demonstrates that this is 
the wrong approach. An understanding 
of last week’s events demonstrates this 
is the wrong approach. And a consider-
ation of the political tactics that we 
have seen in recent days, months, and 
years tells you that this is a disingen-
uous approach at best and 100 percent 
politically motivated. 
I was elected in 2018. My entire con-
gressional career has been consumed by 
impeaching 
or 
removing 
President 
Trump. After the Russia collusion hoax 
and a phone call to the Ukrainian 
President, and then a failed impeach-
ment attempt that resulted in an ac-
quittal, here we are, a little more than 
a week away from a new President 
being sworn in, attempting this trav-
esty both to the Constitution and to 
America as a whole. 
This is dangerous, unconstitutional, 
and does nothing to heal this country 
and move this country forward. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand before the House floor today 
alarmed—alarmed that just days ago a 
sitting President stirred up a deadly 
attack on our U.S. Capitol. I join my 
colleagues in calling on Vice President 
PENCE to activate Section 4 of the 25th 
Amendment. 
It has become abundantly clear that 
this 
President 
has 
threatened 
our 
democratic system, has interfered with 
the peaceful transition of power, and 
has endangered an equal branch of gov-
ernment. The President of the United 
States is unhinged, unfit, and unstable, 
or as we say in my district, ‘‘esta loco 
el hombre,’’ to the point where he is 
willing to tear our democracy down un-
less he prevails in his quest to overturn 
the election that he clearly lost. 
The actions taken by this President 
and those who enable him show that he 
is unfit to uphold the duties of his of-
fice. For the sake of our Nation’s secu-
rity, this President must be swiftly re-
moved.

January 12, 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
democracy is a gift that one generation 
gives to the next. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Col-
orado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose yet another Democrat 
witch hunt. We should take Democrats 
at their word when they say: Never let 
a good crisis go to waste. 
While section 4 of the 25th Amend-
ment has never been used, a plain read-
ing of the text, coupled with the con-
text of its ratification, contemplates a 
very different scenario from the one we 
are currently in. 
b 2200 
It envisions a President’s disability 
resulting from serious illness or injury. 
To suggest it should be used in a dif-
ferent context violates the very intent 
of the 25th Amendment. 
To be clear, this resolution is a divi-
sive political stunt which would have 
no force of law and is a waste of our 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a 
clear overreach, as invoking the 25th 
Amendment is not something Congress 
can initiate, and this must be initiated 
by the executive branch. 
Democrats talk about unity, but 
clearly that is just talk, as their ac-
tions only further divide us. Their hy-
pocrisy is on full display this week 
with this 25th Amendment stunt, Arti-
cles of Impeachment, censure bills, and 
other efforts to try to punish Repub-
licans for false accusations of inciting 
the type of violence they have so fre-
quently and transparently supported in 
the past. 
Throughout 2020, we witnessed Demo-
crats welcome, encourage, and even 
normalize violence. For them, violent 
riots were effective in advancing their 
agenda. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Very 
quickly, 
the 
gentlewoman, 
whom I have not had the pleasure to 
meet yet, confuses disability and inca-
pacity. Franklin D. Roosevelt was in a 
wheelchair. He had a disability, and he 
was one of our greatest Presidents. 
President Lincoln, according to histo-
rians, suffered from depression, but he 
was one of our greatest Presidents. 
Incapacity is different. Incapacity is 
demonstrated by President Trump’s 
complete, total inability to conform 
his conduct to the rule of law and the 
Constitution. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I came 
to Congress to make sure that no par-
ent ever experienced the pain that I 
have. I came to Congress to fight for 
children who have practiced active 
shooter drills at the same time that 
they are simply learning how to read, 
for families who have lost loved ones to 
gun violence, and for communities that 
will never ever be the same. 
Last Wednesday, Members of this 
body hid from insurrectionists behind 
barricades and locked doors. Staffers of 
this hallowed institution texted to 
their loved ones, ‘‘They are banging on 
the doors outside. I love you.’’ 
And citizens of this Nation watched 
in real time as rioters stormed the Cap-
itol through shattered windows and 
broken glass. The result of the Presi-
dent’s rhetoric has left five Americans 
dead. 
Our response to anyone who seeks to 
overthrow the will of the people must 
be unwavering and resolute. I didn’t 
come to Congress to do this. But Presi-
dent Trump’s actions warrant his im-
mediate removal from office. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. FALLON). 
Mr. FALLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak against this resolution. 
I am at a loss. 
I can’t believe the very first time 
that I have the honor and privilege to 
address this august Chamber is to talk 
about removing the President of the 
United States because he held a per-
mitted, legal, and peaceful rally. 
It is nothing but a wasteful political 
grandstand. Let’s make no mistake: 
January 6 was a dark day in our es-
teemed Nation’s history. It was a dark 
and sad day. 
On the afternoon of January 6, a mob 
breached our sacred Capitol. Donald 
Trump didn’t. A mob destroyed prop-
erty and vandalized historic treasures 
and ran amuck on these grounds, but 
Donald Trump didn’t. 
A mob committed despicable, evil ac-
tions of violence against fellow Ameri-
cans, but Donald Trump didn’t. In fact, 
Donald Trump urged and, in fact, he 
demanded peaceful dissent and nothing 
more. Our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle want us to unnecessarily 
remove a President when we are meas-
uring the time he has left, not in years, 
months, weeks, or days—he has got 182 
hours left in office. 
You don’t achieve unity by simply 
saying it. You achieve unity through 
actions. This resolution accomplishes 
not unity but, rather, is a waste of 
time, and fosters further divisiveness. I 
am going to vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I had 
planned remarks here, but I have to re-
spond to my colleague. His words are 
simply too much to bear. 
The gentleman talks a lot about the 
mob and culpability. Who summoned 
the mob? Who encouraged the mob? 
Who incited the mob? You know as 
well as I do that the President did. I 
stood here 6 days ago in this exact 
same spot, and I quoted Lincoln’s ad-
monition that ‘‘we shall nobly save, or 
meanly lose, the last best hope of 
Earth.’’ 
Less than 10 minutes later, a violent 
mob breached the Capitol, the first 
breach of this hallowed building, the 
citadel of liberty, since the War of 1812. 
Congress must respond. Our under-
taking here is not about politics. It is 
a matter of conscience. I support the 
distinguished gentleman from Mary-
land’s resolution. I pray the Vice Presi-
dent will honor his oath and reconsider 
and invoke the provisions of the 25th 
Amendment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, well, they 
may be calling on the Vice President, 
but based on his letter, he is not an-
swering. 
Everybody in this country knows 
that they wanted to impeach President 
Trump on his first day in office. And it 
looks like they are going to want to 
impeach him on his last day too. But 
all he did in the middle was rescue our 
economy, rebuild our military, reform 
the VA, and reduce America’s involve-
ment in foreign wars. 
Now, I join the bipartisan caucus 
condemning the violence that we saw 
at our Capitol, but the hypocrisy is 
just downright disorienting. 
President Trump called for protests 
that would be peaceful and patriotic. 
He got labeled a national security 
threat. Yet the gentlewoman from 
California can call on her supporters to 
get physical and in the faces of Repub-
licans, and she gets the chairmanship 
of the Financial Services Committee. 
Republican Members of Congress uti-
lized a process contemplated in the 
Constitution to offer an objection, and 
we were labeled seditionists. 
Democrat 
Members 
of 
Congress 
raised funds for groups attacking our 
police, burning our cities, destroying 
our businesses, establishing autono-
mous zones, and they were celebrated 
as justice warriors. 
Wednesday, they called for unity, de-
mocracy, and healing. Now, just days 
later, seeking power and political ad-
vantage, the Democrats have reverted 
to the mean. They have gone back to 
their natural state: the party of im-
peachment, removal, and division. 
They are about to have unified con-
trol of the government. Maybe they 
would use this time to preview an 
agenda for the American people. 
The last two times the 25th Amend-
ment was invoked, it was to facilitate 
a colonoscopy. Now they are using it to 
facilitate a transition to Joe Biden. 
How weird. Why? 
I would call it virtue signaling, but 
there is no virtue in it. This removal 
effort isn’t for America. It is for them 
for their ability to showcase and wield 
power, and we see the power of can-
cellation and removal on full display in 
America today. Forbes Magazine has 
called for White House officials to be 
shamed and unemployable. 
ABC News has called for the cleans-
ing of the Trump movement. I don’t 
know what that means, but talking 
about cleansing our fellow human 
beings sure is scary. Big Tech has driv-
en consumers and conservatives off of

monopolistic platforms, and when we 
created our own platform, Parler, it 
was nuked from the internet alto-
gether. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
was booted from a Harvard advisory 
board because she took an adverse posi-
tion on electors that had been taken by 
every single member of the Congres-
sional Black Caucus in 2001. 
Cancellations for some, celebrations 
for others for doing the exact same 
thing. 
The President of the United States 
can’t tweet or post on Facebook, but 
we know from Project Veritas that the 
principal counsel for PBS can call for 
the government to steal children from 
Republicans and throw Molotov cock-
tails at the White House. We should 
allow America to heal before America 
is lost, but that is not what is hap-
pening today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Florida an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. GAETZ. Mr. Speaker, the pur-
pose of the resolution today, they want 
to show you that they can still tear 
things down. I guess, over the next 2 
years, we will see if they are capable of 
building anything or anyone up. 
This is a deeply unpopular impeach-
ment. The public wishes we were here 
dealing with coronavirus, not the virus 
of Trump hatred that you seem to have 
found no vaccine for. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I heard one of our colleagues say it 
was the fault of the mob, not Donald 
Trump. But who summoned the mob? 
Who created the mob? Who assembled 
it? 
You don’t have to trust us if you 
don’t like what you call ‘‘Democrat 
Members.’’ We do prefer Democratic 
Members for the new ones, but how 
about this? Listen to the chair of your 
own conference. 
The chair of the Republican Con-
ference, LIZ CHENEY, said, ‘‘The Presi-
dent of the United States summoned 
this mob, assembled the mob, and lit 
the flame of this attack. Everything 
that followed was his doing. None of 
this would have happened without the 
President.’’ 
So you can hate the Democrat Mem-
bers all you want. That is the chair of 
the Republican Conference. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, like all of us in this 
Chamber, the Vice President and the 
Cabinet swore in their oaths of office 
to protect and defend the Constitution 
from enemies foreign and domestic. 
Now they must fulfill that oath by 
invoking the 25th Amendment. Donald 
Trump’s reckless actions on and lead-
ing to January 6 underscore that he is 
a clear and present danger to our 
democratic traditions. He repeatedly 
and blatantly lied, spouting baseless 
claims of a stolen election and fraud. 
He called on his supporters to come 
to D.C. on January 6, a day which he 
said ‘‘will be wild,’’ and willfully in-
cited an armed and deadly insurrection 
against another branch of our govern-
ment. 
President Trump must be held ac-
countable, and we must return to the 
peaceful transfer of power. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. CLYBURN). 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this resolution. In recent 
days, it has become indisputable that 
this President is unable to uphold his 
oath to preserve, protect, and defend 
the Constitution. 
On the contrary, he seems only capa-
ble of attacking the Constitution. 
Never before has a President sought to 
overturn a fair and secure election, 
threatening State officials to manufac-
ture fraudulent votes. 
Never before has a President incited 
mob violence to block certification of 
his opponent’s victory. 
Never before has a President refused 
to condemn and demand the cessation 
of an attack on our country. 
The devastating bruises on our Na-
tion’s soul can only begin to heal by re-
moving the weapon used to bludgeon 
us. 
The Vice President must invoke the 
25th Amendment to immediately re-
move power from this dangerous Presi-
dent. And if he doesn’t, we must vote 
to impeach. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Mr. Speak-
er, I am so glad our friends have 
changed their mantra from ‘‘stop the 
steal’’ to ‘‘start to heal.’’ 
But in order to heal, you have to 
take strong medicine, and that medi-
cine happens to be the truth. My 
friends, the truth is, unfortunately, 
this President is no longer fit to serve. 
We cannot trust this President to 
protect American democracy after he 
encouraged his supporters ‘‘fight like 
hell’’ in storming the Capitol. 
We cannot trust him to protect 
American safety after he told these 
violent seditionists, ‘‘We love you. You 
are very special.’’ 
We cannot trust this President to tell 
right from wrong even today when he 
said that his remarks on January 6 
were ‘‘totally appropriate.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot trust this 
President to protect us when he insti-
gated a mob that tried to kill us. 
b 2215 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. SOTO). 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I was in the 
gallery right behind us when the Cap-
itol was breached. Then domestic ter-
rorists breached the Rotunda. I heard 
the loud sounds of gunshots through 
this sacred Chamber. My last images 
were brave Capitol Police, guns drawn, 
to protect us. 
This was the first armed insurrection 
in over 200 years. Who incited this vio-
lent insurrection? Donald J. Trump. 
Our resolution states these protests 
were encouraged by him. He urged mil-
lions of his followers to come and ‘‘stop 
the steal,’’ which is a lie. 
And let’s say this now for the RECORD 
and for the ages: Joe Biden won. 
And for this high crime nearly rip-
ping our country apart, we should be 
removing him by the 25th Amendment 
or he should be impeached. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. WATERS). 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, on Janu-
ary 6, 2021, domestic terrorists the 
President has empowered for years 
stormed the Capitol, desecrated the 
people’s House, and threatened the 
lives of the Speaker, Vice President, 
and countless other Members and staff. 
None of us will ever forget that day. 
The invasion of the Capitol was not 
only foreseeable, it was inevitable be-
cause of the many years the President 
has spent fanning the flames of hatred 
and racism in our country. 
The facts are clear: The President 
rallied his supporters at the White 
House and then sent them to the Cap-
itol to disrupt our democracy and over-
turn an election. 
I won’t spend another second explain-
ing why Donald Trump should have 
long ago been removed from office. 
Donald Trump showed us who he was 
from the very beginning. Too many 
people turned a blind eye, and, last 
Wednesday, our country paid the price. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time both sides have 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 73⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this past year, govern-
ment told Americans: You can’t go to 
church, you can’t go to work, you can’t 
go to school. 
One hour ago, Democrats told Repub-
licans, new rules—new rules for the 
House. 
Today, you can say anything you 
want about the President, no rule on 
decorum, no rule about attacking per-
sonality. They can say anything they 
want, and we see we have done that. 
Today, on the floor, you have to wear 
a mask. If your masks comes below 
your nose, you are going to get fined. 
And in order to come in here and de-
bate and constitutionally represent

January 12, 2021 
your constituents, the 750,000 people we 
all get the privilege of serving, you had 
to walk through a metal detector. 
And they did all those changes with 
less than 40 minutes of debate. 
And, tomorrow, they are going to im-
peach a President, a President who is 
leaving office in 8 days—8 days before 
there will be a peaceful transfer of 
power, just like there has been every 
other time in American history. But 
they are going to do impeachment. 
They are going to do it, again. 
They have been obsessed with it. It is 
truly an obsession. People on the Dem-
ocrat side started calling for impeach-
ment the day President Trump was in-
augurated. They attacked him before 
he even won the first election, before 
he won in 2016. They attacked him that 
summer when they started their inves-
tigation. 
This is scary, where this goes, be-
cause this is more than about impeach-
ing the President of the United States; 
this is about canceling the President 
and canceling all the people you guys 
disagree with. That is what scares me 
more than anything. 
We have seen it play out over the 
past several days. I never thought I 
would see the things that we are now 
witnessing. I don’t know where it ends, 
but I will tell you what: It should scare 
us all. 
And I said this in the Committee on 
the Judiciary—and the gentleman from 
Maryland will remember this—the can-
cel culture doesn’t just go after con-
servatives and Republicans. It won’t 
just stop there. It will come for us all. 
That is what is frightening. 
And I hope you all recognize that and 
that at some point we can unite and 
actually do things that help those folks 
back home that we all get the privilege 
of representing. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the cancel 
culture of violent white supremacy 
tried to cancel out all of our lives last 
Wednesday. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. PA-
NETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Mr. Speaker, on Jan-
uary 7 at 4 a.m., I was right outside 
those doors where, 14 hours earlier, a 
rioter was shot as she violently tried to 
enter this Chamber. 
It was in that early morning and at 
that location that I had a brief con-
versation with Vice President MIKE 
PENCE right after we finished certi-
fying the electoral college. 
I was proud that we did our job that 
morning despite the violence we expe-
rienced earlier that day, but I knew 
that was not enough because of the se-
ditious actions by President Trump be-
fore that riot and his inaction during 
that riot. So I said to the Vice Presi-
dent, ‘‘It’s up to you to keep us safe.’’ 
Tonight, with the President still in 
office, I am beyond asking; I am legis-
lating to compel the Vice President to 
convene the Cabinet, to conclude that 
the President is not just unable but, 
clearly, he is unwilling and unworthy 
to discharge his duties. 
So, through this legislation, I ask my 
colleagues to call on the Vice Presi-
dent to invoke the 25th Amendment, 
yes, to keep us safe and keep this Na-
tion secure. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the misuse of the 25th 
Amendment. 
To preserve separation of powers, the 
authors of the 25th Amendment cor-
rectly intended section 4 to be initiated 
by the Vice President, not by the re-
quest of Congress. 
Process concerns aside, the fact is, 
removing the President from office will 
not heal our Nation. It will not bridge 
our partisan divides, give Americans 
hope, or bring us together. It will only 
make things worse. 
With just days away until President 
Trump leaves the White House and just 
days into our new Congress, we have 
more important things to do. We 
should be working to hold Big Tech ac-
countable. We should be working to 
help families and small businesses get 
through the pandemic. We should be 
working on jobs, on infrastructure, on 
energy, and all the other issues our 
constituents sent us here to address. 
I am appalled by the violence that 
took place here last week. Those who 
assaulted police officers and forced 
their way into these hallowed halls are 
responsible for their criminal acts and 
must be brought to justice. 
I cannot support the 25th Amend-
ment, but I am also tired of the double 
standard, the double talk, and the dou-
ble trouble that we have brought upon 
the American people. We have to stand 
for our Constitution. This is our Nehe-
miah moment, and we better take ad-
vantage. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. BERA). 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, just over a 
week ago, we all took the oath of of-
fice, all of us, Democrats and Repub-
licans, and part of that oath was to 
support and defend the Constitution 
against all enemies, both foreign and 
domestic. 
It is quite clear what happened last 
Wednesday: a domestic attack on our 
government, a domestic attack on this 
body. Republicans have already ac-
knowledged who instigated the attack. 
The lead instigator was the President 
of the United States. 
Now it is our solemn duty to uphold 
that oath, to defend our Constitution 
against all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic. There is nothing more solemn than 
what we have to do. 
If my colleagues don’t want to in-
voke the 25th Amendment—that is one 
mechanism—we will give you an oppor-
tunity tomorrow to impeach the Presi-
dent. That is our duty. That is what we 
have to do. Let’s uphold our oath. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. GOMEZ). 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, we are 
here tonight because a violent mob, in-
cited by the President of the United 
States based on a lie, laid siege to Con-
gress to overturn a Presidential elec-
tion. 
We have to ask ourselves, what would 
have happened if that mob succeeded? 
Why stop at one election? Why not 
two? Why not make Donald Trump 
President for life? 
Thank God that did not happen and 
they did not succeed. 
However, even after that terrible day 
of January 6, 2021, Donald Trump is 
still using the lie of a stolen election to 
turn American against American for 
his own selfish ends. 
I believe even with only a few days 
left in office that Donald Trump is still 
a danger to our Republic and must be 
removed immediately. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 10 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. GOMEZ. Mr. Speaker, as an ex-
ample, today, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
issued a statement reaffirming their 
devotion to the rule of law and affirm-
ing that Joe Biden will be the 46th 
President of the United States. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this resolution. 
‘‘Impressionable children are watch-
ing all of this, and they are learning 
from us. I believe we each have a moral 
obligation to exercise good judgment 
and model the behavior we hope they 
will emulate.’’ That was Betsy DeVos. 
‘‘As I am sure is the case with many 
of you, it has deeply troubled me in a 
way that I simply cannot set aside.’’ 
That was Elaine Chao. 
Mr. Speaker, these were members of 
the President’s own Cabinet who bore 
the sacred responsibility of taking ac-
tion when the President is clearly unfit 
for office. But their words are all talk, 
and if they will not act, then Congress 
will. 
So, today, we are giving the Vice 
President 24 hours to do right by the 
American people. Remove this Presi-
dent from office, and if you do not, the 
House will impeach. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, 6 days

mob into a frenzy with false claims of 
stolen elections and unconstitutional 
schemes. It was a big lie, the same big 
lie he had been telling for weeks. 
He told the mob, ‘‘We are going to 
the Capitol’’ and ‘‘to fight like hell,’’ 
and they did. Five died. Many more 
were hurt. And we were seconds away 
from something much worse. 
My colleagues, upholding our oath, 
the Constitution, and our democracy 
means recognizing that every second 
that Donald Trump is President the 
Nation is at risk. We have the power to 
do something about it. MIKE
PENCE 
must do his duty, invoke the 25th. If he 
won’t, we will move with urgency to do 
ours and impeach Donald Trump again. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining on 
both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland has 23⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 43⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. 
DAVIDSON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I can’t say it better 
than the Vice President said it himself. 
Vice President MIKE PENCE said, ‘‘Last 
week, I did not yield to pressure to 
exert power beyond my constitutional 
authority to determine the outcome of 
the election, and I will not now yield to 
efforts in the House of Representatives 
to play political games at a time so se-
rious in the life of our Nation.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include this letter in 
the RECORD. 
THE VICE PRESIDENT, 
Washington, DC, January 12, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: Every American 
was shocked and saddened by the attack on 
our Nation’s Capitol last week, and I am 
grateful for the leadership that you and 
other congressional leaders provided in re-
convening Congress to complete the people’s 
business on the very same day. It was a mo-
ment that demonstrated to the American 
people the unity that is still possible in Con-
gress when it is needed most. 
But now, with just eight days left in the 
President’s term, you and the Democratic 
Caucus are demanding that the Cabinet and 
I invoke the 25th Amendment. I do not be-
lieve that such a course of action is in the 
best interest of our Nation or consistent 
with our Constitution. Last week, I did not 
yield to pressure to exert power beyond my 
constitutional authority to determine the 
outcome of the election, and I will not now 
yield to efforts in the House of Representa-
tives to play political games at a time so se-
rious in the life of our Nation. 
As you know full well, the 25th Amend-
ment was designed to address Presidential 
incapacity or disability. Just a few months 
ago, when you introduced legislation to cre-
ate a 25th Amendment Commission, you 
said, ‘‘[a] President’s fitness for office must 
be determined by science and facts.’’ You 
said then that we must be ‘‘[v]ery respectful 
of not making a judgment on the basis of a 
comment or behavior that we don’t like, but 
based on a medical decision.’’ Madam Speak-
er, you were right. Under our Constitution, 
the 25th Amendment is not a means of pun-
ishment or usurpation. Invoking the 25th 
Amendment in such a manner would set a 
terrible precedent. 
After the horrific events of this last week, 
our Administration’s energy is directed to 
ensuring an orderly transition. The Bible 
says that ‘‘for everything there is a season, 
and a time for every purpose under heaven 
. . . a time to heal . . . and a time to build 
up.’’ That time is now. In the midst of a 
global pandemic, economic hardship for mil-
lions of Americans, and the tragic events of 
January 6th, now is the time for us to come 
together, now is the time to heal. 
I urge you and every member of Congress 
to avoid actions that would further divide 
and inflame the passions of the moment. 
Work with us to lower the temperature and 
unite our country as we prepare to inaugu-
rate President-elect Joe Biden as the next 
President of the United States. I pledge to 
you that I will continue to do my part to 
work in good faith with the incoming admin-
istration to ensure an orderly transition of 
power. So help me God. 
Sincerely, 
MICHAEL R. PENCE, 
Vice President of the United States. 
f 
b 2230 
Mr. 
DAVIDSON. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the Vice President for his excel-
lent leadership, for his professionalism, 
and, frankly, for his faithfulness to our 
Constitution. 
Not only would it be an abuse of the 
25th Amendment for MIKE PENCE to in-
voke it to make a political statement, 
it is clearly not our role in Congress to 
do what we are doing here tonight or 
what is proposed to be done by the ma-
jority. 
Speaker PELOSI claims that Presi-
dent Trump incited the mob that at-
tacked the Capitol at a rally. As Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK spoke earlier, he read the 
President’s statement. He encouraged 
people to come peaceably and patrioti-
cally. 
The Washington Post is reporting 
something that I would hope that our 
chairman of the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence would know 
about. The FBI report warned of war at 
the Capitol the day before the attack 
on our Capitol. I am curious how some-
one proposes that the President incited 
the mob at a rally the day before the 
rally. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the article. 
[From The Washington Post, Jan. 12, 2021] 
FBI REPORT WARNED OF ‘WAR’ AT CAPITOL, 
CONTRADICTING CLAIMS THERE WAS NO INDI-
CATION OF LOOMING VIOLENCE 
(By Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky) 
A day before rioters stormed Congress, an 
FBI office in Virginia issued an explicit 
warning that extremists were preparing to 
travel to Washington to commit violence 
and ‘‘war,’’ according to an internal docu-
ment reviewed by The Washington Post that 
contradicts a senior official’s declaration the 
bureau had no intelligence indicating anyone 
at last week’s demonstrations in support of 
President Trump planned to do harm. 
A situational information report approved 
for release the day before the U.S. Capitol 
riot painted a dire portrait of dangerous 
plans, including individuals sharing a map of 
the complex’s tunnels, and possible rally 
points for would-be conspirators to meet in 
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and 
South Carolina and head in groups to Wash-
ington. 
‘‘As of 5 January 2021, FBI Norfolk re-
ceived information indicating calls for vio-
lence in response to ‘unlawful lockdowns’ to 
begin on 6 January 2021 in Washington, 
D.C.,’’ the document says. ‘‘An online thread 
discussed specific calls for violence to in-
clude stating ‘Be ready to fight. Congress 
needs to hear glass breaking, doors being 
kicked in, and blood from their BLM and 
Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get vio-
lent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or 
a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our 
President or we die. NOTHING else will 
achieve this goal.’’ 
BLM is probably a reference to the Black 
Lives Matter movement for racial justice. 
Pantifa is a derogatory term for antifa, a 
far-left anti-fascist movement whose adher-
ents sometimes engage in violent clashes 
with right-wing extremists. 
Yet even with that information in hand, 
the report’s unidentified author expressed 
concern that the FBI might be encroaching 
on free-speech rights. 
The warning is the starkest evidence yet of 
the sizable intelligence failure that preceded 
the mayhem, which claimed the lives of five 
people, although one law enforcement offi-
cial, speaking on the condition of anonymity 
to avoid disciplinary action, said the failure 
was not one of intelligence but of acting on 
the intelligence. 
At the FBI office in Norfolk, the report 
was written within 45 minutes of receiving 
the information, officials said, and shared 
with counterparts in Washington. 
The head of the FBI’s Washington Field Of-
fice, Steven D’Antuono, told reporters on 
Friday that the agency did not have intel-
ligence 
suggesting 
the 
pro-Trump 
rally 
would be anything more than a lawful dem-
onstration. During a news conference Tues-
day, held after The Post’s initial publication 
of this report, he said the alarming Jan. 5 in-
telligence document was shared ‘‘with all 
our law enforcement partners’’ through the 
joint terrorism task force, which includes 
the U.S. Capitol Police, the U.S. Park Police, 
D.C. police, and other federal and local agen-
cies. 
He suggested there was not a great deal for 
law enforcement to do with the information 
because the FBI at that time did not know 
who made the comments. ‘‘That was a thread 
on a message board that was not attrib-
utable to an individual person,’’ D’Antuono 
said Tuesday. 
D’Antuono did not say what, if anything, 
the FBI or other agencies did differently as 
a result of that information. Nor did he ex-
plain why he told reporters on Friday that 
there had been no such intelligence. 
Steven Sund, who resigned as Capitol Po-
lice chief, said in an interview Tuesday that 
he never received nor was made aware of the 
FBI’s field bulletin, insisting he and others 
would have taken the warning seriously had 
it been shared. 
‘‘I did not have that information, nor was 
that information taken into consideration in 
our security planning,’’ Sund said. 
Since the riot, agents and prosecutors have 
been intent on tracking down and arresting 
the most violent participants in the mob, in 
part because there is already significant on-
line discussion of new potential clashes for 
Sunday and again on Jan. 20, when Presi-
dent-elect Joe Biden is set to take the oath 
of office. 
Michael R. Sherwin, the acting U.S. attor-
ney for D.C., said there would be a strike 
force of prosecutors looking to file charges 
of seditious conspiracy where the evidence 
merited it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H144 
January 12, 2021 
The Jan. 5 FBI report notes that the infor-
mation represents the view of the FBI’s Nor-
folk office, is not to be shared outside law 
enforcement circles, that it is not ‘‘finally 
evaluated intelligence,’’ and that agencies 
receiving it ‘‘are requested not to take ac-
tion based on this raw reporting without 
prior coordination with the FBI.’’ 
Multiple law enforcement officials have 
said privately in recent days that the level of 
violence exhibited at the Capitol has led to 
difficult discussions within the FBI and 
other agencies about race, terrorism and 
whether investigators failed to register the 
degree of danger because the overwhelming 
majority of the participants at the rally 
were White conservatives fiercely loyal to 
Trump. 
‘‘Individuals/Organizations named in this 
[situational information report] have been 
identified as participating in activities that 
are protected by the First Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution,’’ the document says. 
‘‘Their inclusion here is not intended to as-
sociate the protected activity with crimi-
nality or a threat to national security, or to 
infer that such protected activity itself vio-
lates federal law. 
‘‘However,’’ it continues, ‘‘based on known 
intelligence and/or specific historical obser-
vations, it is possible the protected activity 
could invite a violent reaction towards the 
subject individual or others in retaliation or 
with the goal of stopping the protected ac-
tivity from occurring in the first instance. In 
the event no violent reaction occurs, FBI 
policy and federal law dictates that no fur-
ther record be made of the protected activ-
ity.’’ 
The document notes that one online com-
ment advised, ‘‘if Antifa or BLM get violent, 
leave them dead in the street,’’ while an-
other said they need ‘‘people on standby to 
provide supplies, including water and med-
ical, to the front lines. The individual also 
discussed the need to evacuate noncombat-
ants and wounded to medical care.’’ 
On Jan. 6, a large, angry crowd of people 
who had attended a rally nearby marched to 
the Capitol, smashing windows and breaking 
doors to get inside. One woman in the mob 
was shot and killed by Capitol Police; offi-
cials said three other in the crowd had med-
ical emergencies and died. A Capitol Police 
officer died after suffering injuries. 
The FBI said in a statement that its 
‘‘standard practice is to not comment on spe-
cific intelligence products,’’ but added that 
FBI field offices ‘‘routinely share informa-
tion with their local law enforcement part-
ners to assist in protecting the communities 
they serve.’’ 
For weeks leading up to the event, FBI of-
ficials discounted any suggestion that the 
activities of Trump supporters upset about 
the scheduled certification of Biden’s elec-
tion win could be a security threat on a scale 
with the racial-justice demonstrations that 
followed the police killing of George Floyd 
in Minneapolis in May. 
While the nation’s capital is one of the 
most heavily guarded cities on the planet, 
local and federal law enforcement agencies 
sought to take a low-key approach to last 
week’s event, publicly and privately express-
ing concerns that they did not want to re-
peat last year’s ugly clashes between pro-
testers and police. 
Some law enforcement officials took the 
view that protesters who support Trump are 
generally known for over-the-top rhetoric 
but not much violence, and therefore the 
event did not pose a particularly serious 
risk, according to people familiar with the 
security discussions leading up to Jan. 6. 
Even so, there were warning signs, though 
none as stark as the one from the FBI’s Nor-
folk office. 
FBI agents had in the weeks before the 
Trump rally visited suspected far-right ex-
tremists, hoping to glean whether they had 
violent intentions, said a person familiar 
with the matter who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity to discuss the law enforcement 
activity. It was not immediately clear who 
was visited or if the FBI was specifically 
tracking anyone who would later be charged 
criminally. These visits were first reported 
Sunday by NBC News. 
In addition, in the days leading up to the 
demonstrations, some Capitol Hill staffers 
were told by supervisors to not come in to 
work that day, if possible, because it seemed 
the danger level would be higher than many 
previous protests, according to a person fa-
miliar with the warning who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity to discuss the mat-
ter. Capitol Police did not take the kind of 
extra precautions, such as frozen zones and 
hardened barriers, that are typically used for 
major events near the Capitol. 
Federal agents are on high alert as the in-
auguration nears, with authorities bracing 
for possible violence not just in Washington 
but also nationwide, officials said. 
The FBI recently issued a different memo 
saying that ‘‘armed protests’’ were being 
planned ‘‘at all 50 state capitols’’ and in D.C. 
in the run-up to the inauguration, according 
to an official familiar with the matter, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss a sensitive law enforcement matter. 
The memo—first reported by ABC News 
and later confirmed by The Post—is a raw 
intelligence product, compiling information 
gathered by the bureau and several other 
government agencies, the official familiar 
with 
the 
matter 
said. 
Some 
of 
it 
is 
unverified, and the threat probably will dif-
fer significantly from place to place, the offi-
cial said. 
But the information it highlights to law 
enforcement is nonetheless troubling—in-
cluding that there was data suggesting peo-
ple might storm government offices or stage 
an uprising were Trump to be removed from 
office, the official said. 
In a statement, the FBI declined to com-
ment specifically on the memo about state 
capitols but said: ‘‘Our efforts are focused on 
identifying, investigating, and disrupting in-
dividuals that are inciting violence and en-
gaging in criminal activity. As we do in nor-
mal course of business, we are gathering in-
formation to identify any potential threats 
and are sharing that information with our 
partners. 
‘‘The FBI respects The rights of individ-
uals 
to 
peacefully 
exercise 
their 
First 
Amendment rights,’’ it said. ‘‘Our focus is 
not on peaceful protesters, but on those 
threatening their safety and the safety of 
other citizens with violence and destruction 
of property.’’ 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Others are reporting 
a timeline that has the breach out of 
sync as well, but that highlights the 
importance. There is far too little that 
we know about this attack on our Cap-
itol. 
Here is what we do know. No one has 
defended this attack on our Capitol. On 
the contrary, we are missing—willfully 
missing, in my opinion—a moment of 
extreme unity in our Nation, just like 
what was willfully done earlier this 
year. 
At a time of great political and par-
tisan division, even seething anger, one 
thing all Americans seem to agree on is 
that these attacks were wrong. The 
President condemned them. He discour-
aged violence, not just on January 6 
but on other days throughout the year 
as he talked about law and order and as 
he talked about something that we fi-
nally seem to agree on, that there is a 
clear distinction between the Constitu-
tion’s First Amendment protection of 
the right to assemble peaceably and 
riots, criminal, unlawful riots. 
There is a distinction between rioters 
and protesters. Frankly, it took us 
months to agree on that as a body in 
Congress, but the people of the United 
States of America agreed to it. They 
understood it. 
I encourage my colleagues across the 
political spectrum, the Members of 
Congress gathered here together today 
and tomorrow, to stand united and 
move forward with the agreement our 
country had, that this was wrong. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to Mr. ESPAILLAT from New 
York. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, we 
have all known it for a while now, but 
this past week it has become undeni-
ably clear: Donald J. Trump is unfit. 
To the Secretaries of Agriculture, 
Defense, Commerce, Education, and 
Transportation: He is unfit. 
To the Secretaries of Health and 
Human Services, Homeland Security, 
Housing, Interior, and Labor: He is 
unfit. 
To the Attorney General: He is unfit. 
To the Vice President of the United 
States: He summons his goons. They 
shut their hoods and came with their 
racist Confederate flag to assassinate 
him, to assassinate the Vice President. 
He is unfit. Invoke the 25th Amend-
ment. If not, we will impeach him to-
morrow. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, after listening to all that I 
have heard this evening, I still have 
the faith and belief that we can come 
together as a unit. 
I was reading my Bible the other day 
and saw that it said: Come and let us 
reason together. Otherwise, we shall all 
be destroyed by the edge of the sword. 
I say to my colleagues: Let’s reason 
together. You cannot erase truth with 
a lie. You cannot pretend that what 
has happened did not happen. Yes, we 
ought to have a President, but it is 
time for this one to go. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this 
resolution and agree wholeheartedly. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the distinguished gentleman 
from California (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, the President of the United 
States instigated an attack against our 
democracy. 
For months, he ginned up his sup-
porters with lies about our election and 
incited them to violence. On the 6th of 
January, he unleashed a mob on the 
Capitol.

The President must be held account-
able for this vile attack. He knew what 
he was doing, and now, five people are 
dead. 
Congress will not be intimidated. 
America will not succumb to mob rule. 
The Vice President can initiate re-
moval of a President who is unfit for 
office, and this President is unfit. He 
must be removed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this resolution, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on impeachment tomorrow. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, what happened at the 
Capitol on January 6 was as wrong as 
wrong can be. It is not what America is 
about, and we condemn this violence. 
We commend the men and women of 
the Capitol Police for their bravery, 
and we mourn the loss of those lives 
that were taken last week. 
Republicans have been consistent. We 
condemn the violence last summer; we 
condemn the violence last week. Demo-
crats have been consistent about one 
thing: their endless quest to overturn 
the 2016 election. They are still trying 
to overturn the 2016 election after the 
2020 election. This has been an obses-
sion with the Democrats. 
In the first round, the first impeach-
ment was based on the anonymous 
whistleblower. The majority tried to 
remove the President from office based 
on a guy whom we weren’t allowed to 
see, know who he or she was, and 
couldn’t cross-examine; who was an 
anonymous 
whistleblower 
with 
no 
firsthand knowledge; who was biased 
against the President; and who worked, 
interestingly enough, for Joe Biden. 
So continuing this quest is not, as 
has been said so many times on the 
floor tonight, what the country needs. 
It is not what the country needs, par-
ticularly after the year the country 
has lived through. 
I hope we will not vote for this, that 
this thing will go down, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote against the resolu-
tion sponsored by the gentleman from 
Maryland. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who is the distin-
guished chairman of the Agriculture 
Committee. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, what we are discussing to-
night isn’t about us. It is about the will 
of the American people. 
They are brokenhearted. They are 
crying. And they are discouraged. 
An overwhelming number of Amer-
ican people want this President out of 
office now. This is why we have to do it 
now. We have to heal the wound. The 
longer the President is over there, the 
more we are tearing the heart and soul 
out of the American people. Let us do 
it now. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this resolution. I thank our Speaker 
for scheduling this, and Rep. RASKIN for his 
leadership and deep knowledge of our Con-
stitution. 
I speak today with sadness in my heart but 
purpose in my bones. This Congress must 
take action to remove Donald Trump from of-
fice as soon as possible, for the clear and 
present danger he poses to our Democracy, 
our national security, and to the American 
people. 
Last Wednesday, we saw Donald Trump in-
cite a violent and deadly insurrection at our 
U.S. Capitol in an attempt to reverse the re-
sults of a free and fair election. The risk that 
he might do so again in the next week is why 
he cannot be trusted for another minute as 
commander in chief, overseeing the nuclear 
codes and the U.S. Military. 
The fastest way to protect our republic from 
Donald Trump is for the Vice President and 
the cabinet to take action under the 25th 
Amendment. I implore them to do so. But if 
they do not, my colleagues and I stand ready 
to defend our democracy from Donald Trump. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H. Res. 21, calling on Vice Presi-
dent PENCE to invoke his powers under the 
25th Amendment. We are in the midst of a na-
tional emergency and President Trump must 
be removed from office immediately, before 
any further damage to this Capitol—or to our 
Republic—can be done. 
Last week’s violent attack on the Capitol 
took root more than 5 years ago when Donald 
Trump first descended the escalator at Trump 
Tower to announce his run for President. 
The hateful rhetoric, baseless accusations, 
and contempt for the democratic process were 
all on display that day. Later, they formed the 
foundation of his presidency. Last week, they 
reached a violent crescendo. 
After losing his bid for reelection—in deci-
sive fashion—President Trump embarked on a 
campaign 
of 
misinformation 
aimed 
at 
delegitimizing the results of a free and fair 
election. When this failed, he tried to intimi-
date local election officials into reversing the 
results. When those brave public servants re-
fused to do his bidding, he made one final 
desperate attempt to hold onto power by at-
tacking the constitutionally mandated process 
of counting and certifying the electoral votes in 
a Joint Session of Congress. 
Although the President had willing volun-
teers to join him, Vice President PENCE re-
fused to exceed his limited authority and reject 
the results of the election. That is when the 
President unleashed his supporters to storm 
the Capitol. And the result—an armed insur-
rection—left in its wake lost lives, property de-
stroyed, desecration of hallowed ground, and 
physical and emotional scars that may never 
fully heal. 
Vice President PENCE upheld his constitu-
tional duty and his oath of office that day. It is 
time for him to do so once more. 
Under the 25th Amendment, the Vice Presi-
dent, along with a majority of the members of 
the Cabinet, may inform Congress ‘‘that the 
President is unable to discharge the powers 
and duties of his office,’’ upon which ‘‘the Vice 
President shall immediately assume the pow-
ers and duties of the office as Acting Presi-
dent.’’ 
This is not a step to be taken lightly—but it 
is the step that must be taken today. 
The President is clearly incapacitated and 
unable to exercise the powers of the presi-
dency to protect the United States, as wit-
nessed by the attack on the Capitol itself. 
Rather than immediately calling for an end to 
the violence and calling on his supporters to 
withdraw, the President waited several hours 
before releasing a half-hearted video that also 
expressed his ‘‘love’’ for the rioters who were 
‘‘special people’’. All the while, he continued 
his efforts to subvert the election, seeking 
Senators who would object to the certification 
of as many as ten states’ electoral votes, with-
out a shred of evidence that there was any 
reason to doubt their authenticity. 
And reports indicate that the threat that our 
country faced on January 6th—from a presi-
dent who would do anything to hold onto 
power—is ongoing. It is a national crisis. It de-
mands immediate action. 
I thank the Gentleman from Maryland, Mr. 
RASKIN—a constitutional scholar and a valu-
able member of the Judiciary Committee—for 
bringing forward this important resolution, and 
I call upon the Vice President to do his con-
stitutional duty and to protect the American 
people from one more day of a dangerous 
presidency. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the res-
olution urging Vice President PENCE and the 
Cabinet to remove President Trump from of-
fice. 
In the interest of full disclosure, I want to 
make it clear that I’ve always thought that 
President Trump was unstable and unfit to 
hold the highest office in the land. But since 
the election, I believe that his actions have be-
come more erratic and angry and dangerous. 
He has developed an alternative worldview 
with no basis in reality in which he won more 
votes than Joe Biden, but the election was 
‘stolen’ from him. I suspect that he may actu-
ally believe that. 
But the facts are clear. The 2020 Presi-
dential election was one of the most open and 
transparent elections in our nation’s history ac-
cording to election officials and observers, 
both Republican and Democratic. The FBI 
said that it found no evidence of widespread 
voter fraud. The Attorney General, chosen by 
the President, said that there was no evidence 
of widespread voter fraud. And the chairman 
of the bipartisan U.S. Election Assistance 
Commission said that there was no evidence 
of widespread voter fraud. 
Nevertheless, Donald Trump has widely re-
peated this message in speeches and over 
social media in the months before and after 
the election, which has led to its widespread 
acceptance by thousands and perhaps mil-
lions of Americans. 
In August, for example, he said ‘‘the only 
way we’re going to lose this election is if the 
election is rigged. Remember that. It’s the only 
way we’re going to lose this election.’’ 
Subsequently, he said ‘‘This is a case 
where they’re trying to steal an election . . . . 
They’re trying to rig an election, and we can’t 
let that happen.’’ 
After the election, he said, ‘‘If you count the 
legal votes, I easily win. If you count the illegal 
votes, they can try to steal the election from 
us.’’ 
And on Christmas Eve, he wrote on 
Facebook, in all capital letters, ‘‘VOTER 
FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY, 
IT IS A FACT!!!’’ 
What’s even more disturbing is that his ac-
tions have displayed a similar unhinged qual-
ity. On election night, for example, he urged

his supporters to harass workers counting 
votes in Arizona and Michigan. He had his 
campaign file over 60 lawsuits challenging the 
election processes in a number of states, 
nearly all of which were rejected by state and 
federal courts—including several which were 
rejected by the Supreme Court, He called Re-
publican members of the Wayne County 
Board of Canvassers in Michigan and pres-
sured them to derail the certification of the 
state’s election results. More recently, he 
called Georgia elections officials and pres-
sured them to ‘‘find votes’’ to overturn the 
presidential election results in Georgia. And 
just last week, he reportedly ignored requests 
to mobilize the National Guard in the midst of 
the attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
I believe that his false, misleading claims 
over an extended period of time, culminating 
in his speech on the morning of January 6— 
repeated and validated on conservative cable 
shows and social media—is the root cause of 
the assault on the Capitol last week. 
President Trump has spent months and 
months undermining the American people’s 
faith in the November presidential election. I 
believe part of it may be a coping mechanism 
for him because he’s totally unwilling to accept 
that he was defeated by someone else. But I 
also believe that parts of it are criminal and a 
deliberate, lengthy effort to undermine and 
overturn what are, by all credible accounts, le-
gitimate election results in order to stay in of-
fice. 
Regardless of the motivation for his actions, 
the President currently appears to be unsta-
ble, unfit, and unable to carry out his duties as 
President of the United States. Moreover, his 
instability raises concerns for many, myself in-
cluded, that in his last few days in office, he 
might take some dangerous action or pursue 
some policy that will harm the American peo-
ple in a significant way. 
This man currently controls the entire fed-
eral government, including the U.S. military, 
and he has the U.S. nuclear codes at his fin-
gertips. 
I fear for our nation as long as he remains 
in office under these circumstances. 
That’s why I’m supporting this resolution 
today to urge Vice President PENCE, and a 
majority of the Cabinet to remove him from of-
fice as soon as humanly possible. I believe 
that the future of our nation may be at stake.

HONORING 
KAMALA 
HARRIS, 
AMERICA’S 
FIRST 
FEMALE, 
BLACK, 
AND 
ASIAN-AMERICAN 
VICE PRESIDENT 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to congratulate KAMALA HARRIS on becom-
ing vice president of the United States when 
she will be sworn into office on January 20, 
2021, on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Her 
journey to the White House is a path of many 
historic firsts. 
She is the first woman; the first black 
woman; the first Asian-American woman; and 
the first graduate of an historically black uni-
versity and member of the black Greek- letter 
organization, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, In-
corporated, to serve as vice president. She 
also was the first black woman to be elected 
district attorney in California and the state’s 
first woman to serve as attorney general. In 
addition, she is the second black woman to 
win election to the U.S. Senate. 
Her motto, ‘‘You may be the first, but make 
sure you’re not the last,’’ are words of wisdom 
passed down from her mother that helped 
mold her into a role model who is inspiring 
girls and women around the globe to shatter 
glass ceilings of their own. 
The vice president will, however, be both 
‘‘the first and last in the room’’ as she and 
President Joe Biden address the converging 
crises our nation is currently facing: COVID– 
19, an economic downturn, and racial injus-
tice. 
Vice President HARRIS’s commitment to 
leveraging every aspect of the federal govern-
ment to improve outcomes for men and boys 
of color also is commendable. 
During the 116th Congress, we joined 
forces to pass an historic, bipartisan piece of 
legislation that created the Commission on the 
Social Status of Black Men and Boys. I look 
forward to working with her to enact this legis-
lation and form a thriving commission that will 
address pressing racial inequities and shape 
landmark legislation. 
She will be honored for being a champion 
for boys and men of color at the 5000 Role 
Models of Excellence Project’s 28th Annual 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship Break-
fast on January 18, 2021. The 5000 Role 
Models of Excellence Project is an in-school, 
dropout prevention and mentoring program 
serving thousands of boys of color. 
Vice President HARRIS’s career in public 
service began long before she was elected to 
office. Thirteen-year-old KAMALA successfully 
organized the children at her apartment com-
plex to protest not being allowed to play in the 
building’s grassy courtyard. She turned this 
burgeoning passion into a thriving career after 
earning a bachelor’s degree in political 
science at Howard University and a law de-
gree at the University of California’s Hastings 
College of Law. It is an honor and a joy to call 
our vice president my Alpha Kappa Alpha so-
rority sister and dear friend. 
f 
HONORING BRUCE HAMMOCK 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bruce Hammock and his exem-
plary interdisciplinary career. He has been a 
legendary figure in his field for over four dec-
ades and his efforts have made critical ad-
vancements 
in 
our 
understanding 
of 
neurodegenerative diseases, non-addictive so-
lutions to managing chronic pain, and environ-
mental conservation. 
Dr. Hammock’s recent research on regu-
latory enzyme inhibitors and their effect on 
neuroinflammation has reshaped the way we 
understand both the cause and cure of the de-
generative disease. Alongside his UC Davis 
team, Dr. Hammock partnered with Baylor 
University as well as other researchers across 
the globe to study soluble epoxide hydrolase 
(sEH) and its effect on the brains of mice. Dr. 
Hammock’s study found that inhibiting sEH 
may 
offer 
a 
new 
pathway 
to 
reduce 
neuroinflammation 
and 
neurodegeneration; 
leading to a breakthrough in recognizing the 
potential benefits of sEH inhibitors in Alz-
heimer’s treatment. 
Groundbreaking research is nothing new in 
the world of Dr. Hammock. He is currently a 
distinguished professor at UC Davis in the De-
partment of Entomology and Nematology and 
part of the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer 
Center. During his time at the university Ham-
mock has been at the helm of the Superfund 
Research Program for over three decades—a 
government-funded program focused on find-
ing solutions to the complex health and envi-
ronmental issues linked with the nation’s haz-
ardous waste sites. 
In addition to his invaluable contributions to 
science, Dr. Hammock has taken up another 
admirable charge—to make science and learn-
ing fun. Every year he and his lab organize a 
water balloon fight between faculty and stu-
dents on the lawn of UC Davis’ Briggs Hall 
where other labs and bystanders join in on the 
action. This event is a small glimpse into 
Hammock’s unique character—one described 
by colleagues as enthusiastic, creative, and 
hard-working. 
Dr. Hammock’s limitless drive and curiosity 
contribute both to the stellar reputation of UC 
Davis as an esteemed research institute and 
California’s 3rd Congressional District as a 
whole. We wish him all the best in his endeav-
ors and look forward to seeing all that he ac-
complishes in the future. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROSE 
MATSUI OCHI 
HON. JUDY CHU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Rose Matsui Ochi, who 
passed away on December 13, 2020, at the 
age of 81. Rose was a dedicated public serv-
ant, a longtime constituent of mine in Mon-
terey Park, California, and a dear friend. 
Rose was born on December 15, 1938, in 
East Los Angeles, but her early childhood was 
spent imprisoned at Rohwer concentration 
camp in Arkansas along with countless other 
Japanese Americans during World War II. This 
childhood experience with systemic racism 
helped forge her passion for social justice and 
solidified her determination to break barriers. 
At a time when people of color were not ex-
pected or encouraged to seek higher edu-
cation, Rose graduated from UCLA in 1959 
and received her graduate degree in edu-
cation from Cal State Los Angeles in 1967. 
After witnessing the 1968 East L.A. walkouts 
by Latino students demanding equal condi-
tions in schools, Rose was inspired to pursue 
a career in law to create a more just and equi-
table society. She graduated from Loyola Law 
School in 1972 and was admitted to the Cali-
fornia Bar that year. 
Seen by many as a rising star who pos-
sessed an incredible legal mind, Rose quickly 
became involved in public policy at the federal 
level. In 1979, she was appointed to President 
Carter’s Select Commission on Immigration 
and Refugee Policy, where she pushed for im-
migration reform and helped secure a pathway 
to citizenship for thousands of undocumented 
immigrants. She then took from her childhood 
experiences and helped secure a federal apol-
ogy and redress for Japanese American de-
tention camp survivors in 1988. And in 1997, 
Rose was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to be 
the director of the Community Relations Serv-
ice at the Department of Justice, becoming the 
first Asian-American woman to serve as an 
assistant attorney general. 
She also had incredible achievements in her 
service to Los Angeles communities. She 
served for two decades as the director of the 
City’s criminal justice office, where she helped 
reduce gang violence by supporting programs 
for at-risk youth, designed successful commu-
nity policing methods, and increased the num-
ber of women and officers of color within the 
Los Angeles Police Department. And in 2001, 
she broke yet another barrier by becoming the 
first Asian American woman to serve on the 
Los Angeles Police Commission. 
On top of her long list of accomplishments, 
Rose Ochi paved the way for people like me. 
There were so few Asian-American women in 
leadership positions as I was growing up that 
I never dreamed I could be an elected official,

let alone a Congressmember. But Rose’s spir-
it, determination, and boldness were an inspi-
ration to me. She was passionate and com-
passionate, and always had a word of encour-
agement for me. I was lucky to have her as 
my constituent and I was lucky to have known 
her. I ask my colleagues to join me in com-
memorating the life of an extraordinary woman 
and a trailblazing public servant.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EVELYN 
FERNANDEZ 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to 
honor the life of Mrs. Evelyn Fernandez. 
Mrs. Evelyn Fernandez was born on Feb-
ruary 14, 1932, in Jamaica and migrated to 
the United States in the late 1970s and be-
came a resident of Brooklyn, New York. She 
was a retired schoolteacher and passionate 
about education. 
Mrs. Fernandez was a sincere woman who 
loved God and her church and was faithful in 
her service to The Faith Center Ministries. She 
was a woman of great faith who cared deeply 
for her fellow congregants and worked tire-
lessly to better the lives of all those in her 
community. 
Mrs. Fernandez was the devoted mother of 
three sons and three daughters, among them 
Bishop Henry Fernandez, spiritual leader of 
The Faith Center Ministries in Sunrise, Florida. 
I join Bishop Fernandez and his family as they 
mourn the loss of this kind and compassionate 
soul. 
In the days, weeks and months ahead, we 
will celebrate her life and honor her legacy. 
While this loss will be felt deeply by everyone, 
we are forever privileged to have shared this 
time with her on Earth. May her memory be a 
blessing. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOYCE 
ELLIS 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Joyce Ellis, who 
passed away on December 16, 2020, at the 
age of 62. Ms. Ellis was a remarkable woman 
with a steadfast commitment to serving her 
community, and her leadership and advocacy 
for our region’s youth will be greatly missed. 
At the age of 17, Ms. Ellis opened her first 
dance studio, eventually expanding her oper-
ation to include four studios throughout south-
western Pennsylvania. Ms. Ellis’ students per-
formed across the Commonwealth, from com-
munity parades to Steelers and Pirates 
games. They were also nationally recognized 
at the Cherry Blossom Festival in our nation’s 
capital. 
While Ms. Ellis was an accomplished dancer 
and choreographer, she was also deeply dedi-
cated to mentorship. Students and parents re-
member her commitment to ensuring dancers 
of all skill levels were set up for future suc-
cess. After receiving an Observer-Reponer 
Person of the Year award, Ms. Ellis best 
summed up her approach, ‘‘I really feel I was 
put on this planet to help people become bet-
ter, and upon doing so, I become better.’’ 
At the height of her career, Ms. Ellis felt a 
calling from God to leave her studios and re-
open the LeMoyne Community Center in 
Washington, Pennsylvania, becoming Execu-
tive Director in 2007. Under her leadership, 
the once dilapidated building became a place 
filled with hope and promise. 
Ms. Ellis fiercely believed the LeMoyne 
Community Center should be a source of sta-
bility and comfort for local children. She estab-
lished a food program to provide meals for 
youths across Washington County and started 
Homework and More, a program hosting after-
school activities and tutoring. When school 
was not in session, the center held summer 
camp and Coco’s Christmas, which sourced 
clothing, gifts, and meals for families in need. 
Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness 
that I recognize the loss of Joyce Ellis. Ms. 
Ellis indelibly advanced and improved her 
community through the LeMoyne Community 
Center, and her service will leave a lasting 
legacy for children and families in our region.

HONORING 
BENJAMIN 
CRUMP, 
AMERICAN CIVIL RIGHTS ATTOR-
NEY AND MEMBER OF THE 5000 
ROLE MODELS OF EXCELLENCE 
PROJECT 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to congratulate Benjamin Crump, a nation-
ally recognized civil rights attorney who seeks 
justice for families who’ve lost a loved one to 
police and racially charged violence, and a 
member of the 5000 Role Models of Excel-
lence Project. 
In 2012, Mr. Crump represented the family 
of my constituent, Trayvon Martin, 17, who 
was killed by neighborhood watch vigilante 
George Zimmerman. He also has represented 
the families of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who 
was killed by a Cleveland Police officer while 
holding a toy gun; and Michael Brown, 18, 
who was shot dead by a police officer in Fer-
guson, Missouri. He is currently representing 
the family of George Floyd, who was killed by 
a police officer in Minneapolis, and Jacob 
Blake, who was left paralyzed after being shot 
by a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Mr. 
Crump has collected millions of dollars for 
more than 200 victims and their families and 
his advocacy has significantly raised aware-
ness of the racial inequities embedded in our 
nation’s judicial system. 
Mr. Crump, who has been described as ‘‘the 
hardest working attorney in the country,’’ 
earned his bachelor’s and law degrees from 
Florida State University. His grandmother, who 
helped raise him, once said, ‘‘When you get a 
chance to speak truth to power, you do it.’’ He 
remembers those words everyday no matter 
where he is and uses them as a guide. 
I have the utmost confidence that Mr. 
Crump will continue to serve underserved 
communities. He has exemplified his selfless-
ness by dedicating a large part of his practice 
to pro bono cases, leaving low-income clients 
without debt. Because he is such an inspira-
tional role model, Mr. Crump will be inducted 
into the 5000 Role Models of Excellence 
Project at its 28th Annual Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Scholarship Breakfast on Monday, 
January 18, 2021.

THE PRESIDENT IS MENTALLY 
UNFIT 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, we recently witnessed an unprece-
dented attack on the Capitol as a joint session 
of Congress convened to count and certify the 
Electoral College votes. This was an attack on 
not only the hallowed halls of the Capitol, but 
on the very heart and soul of our democracy: 
it was an attack on the peaceful transition of 
power. 
There can be no doubt who instigated the 
insurrectionists and incited them to domestic 
terrorism. The President of the United States 
called on his supporters to march on the Cap-
itol. He told them: ‘‘We’re probably not going 
to be cheering so much for some of them be-
cause you’ll never take back our country with 
weakness. You have to show strength, and 
you have to be strong.’’ 
In 2017, Dr. Harold Schwartz wrote this op- 
ed, published in the Hartford Courant. In it, he 
describes several mental disorders that may 
be applicable to the President. It has proven 
to be remarkably prescient and foreshadowed 
the events of January 6, 2021. I include it in 
the RECORD here so that Members and the 
public may draw their own conclusions about 
the President’s fitness to serve out the remain-
der of his term. I, for one, believe that the 
President is a malignant narcissist lacking the 
capacity to discharge the duties of his office 
and call on the Vice President to invoke the 
25th Amendment. 
I’M NOT DIAGNOSING TRUMP: JUST SAYING . . . 
(By Harold I. Schwartz) 
Psychiatrists are prohibited by the so- 
called Goldwater Rule from diagnosing pub-
lic figures they have not personally assessed. 
This prohibition followed the 1964 election, 
when Barry Goldwater was the Republican 
candidate for president and felt by many to 
have extreme views. He was castigated in a 
survey of American psychiatrists and un-
fairly labeled with virtually every diagnosis 
in the book. 
Fearful of the implications of diagnosing 
from afar, the American Psychiatric Asso-
ciation prohibited this activity to protect 
the credibility of American psychiatry and 
the privacy, dignity and confidentiality of 
public figures. On the one hand, the prohibi-
tion makes sense. On the other, it’s a gag 
rule preventing psychiatrists from contrib-
uting to the conversation. 
It may not be necessary, however, for a 
psychiatrist to offer a diagnosis to join the 
discussion of just what is (or is not) wrong 
with Donald Trump. Mere information may 
suffice. In this spirit I bring you, straight 
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (the DSM– 
V, psychiatry’s diagnostic bible), the descrip-
tions of several mental disorders. Far be it

from me to say they apply to Mr. Trump. 
You may decide. 
Let’s start in the Personality Disorders 
section. There are many disorders within 
this category and their features often mix 
and match. Here are the characteristics, 
right out of the DSM–V of someone with 
Narcissistic Personality Disorder (You only 
need five to qualify): 
1. Has a grandiose sense of self-importance 
(e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, 
expects to be recognized as superior without 
commensurate achievements) 
2. Is preoccupied with fantasies of unlim-
ited success, power, brilliance, beauty or 
ideal love. 
3. Believes that he or she is ‘‘special’’ and 
unique and can only be understood by, or 
should associate with, other special or high- 
status people (or institutions). 
4. Requires excessive admiration 
5. Has a sense of entitlement (i.e., unrea-
sonable expectations of especially favorable 
treatment or automatic compliance with his 
or her expectations 
6. Is interpersonally exploitative 
7. Lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize 
or identify with the feelings and needs of 
others. 
8. Is often envious of others or believes 
that others are envious of him or her. 
9. Shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or 
attitudes. 
Another interesting personality diagnosis 
is Antisocial Personality Disorder, the tech-
nical term for the more commonly used psy-
chopathy. I have selected criteria that you 
may find most salient (you only need three 
to qualify): 
Deceitfulness, as indicated by repeated 
lying, use of aliases, or conning others for 
personal profit or pleasure. 
Impulsivity or failure to plan ahead. 
Irritability and aggressiveness, as indi-
cated by repeated physical fights or assaults. 
Consistent irresponsibility, as indicated by 
repeated failure to sustain consistent work 
behavior or honor financial obligations. 
Lack of remorse, as indicated by being in-
different to or rationalizing having hurt, 
mistreated or stolen from another 
While it’s not a formal diagnosis, people 
who combine very severe narcissism with se-
vere psychopathy are said to have Malignant 
Narcissism syndrome—it is the very worst 
forms of narcissism and psychopathy com-
bined. You really don’t want to have a ma-
lignant narcissist in your life. 
And because I’ve already suggested that 
elements of the various personality disorders 
often combine, here are a few of the features 
of Paranoid Personality Disorder that may 
be of interest: suspicion that others are 
harming or deceiving him or her, reading 
hidden demeaning or threatening meanings 
into benign remarks or events, persistently 
bearing grudges (unforgiving of perceived in-
juries), quick to counterattack to perceived 
attacks on his or her character. To qualify 
for any of the personality disorder diagnoses, 
the individual must either be distressed by 
these characteristics or, in some way, dys-
functional. Very successful people can be 
dysfunctional in many aspects of their lives. 
Still another diagnosis is Attention-Def-
icit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Just a few of the 
criteria for this include: the failure to give 
close attention to details, difficulty sus-
taining attention to tasks, an avoidance of 
tasks that require sustained mental effort 
and easy distractability. 
The 
definition 
of 
delusional 
thinking 
might be of interest. Delusions are defined as 
fixed false beliefs. But a fixed belief is not a 
delusion, as odd as that may seem to many, 
if it is accepted and shared by the social cul-
tural group the believer finds himself in. In 
a severe personality disorder it may be dif-
ficult to distinguish a fantastical wish from 
a delusion. But we are splitting definitional 
hairs here. 
I must reiterate, lest I find myself at odds 
with my professional organization: I have 
never interviewed Donald Trump and I am 
not diagnosing him. I am merely directing 
your attention to information that anyone 
can find in the diagnostic manual. It would 
be improper of me, as a psychiatrist, to do 
more. On the other hand, you don’t need a 
psychiatrist . . . er, a weatherman, to know 
which way the wind blows.

HONORING HARKER HEIGHTS, TX 
COUNCILMAN JOHN REIDER 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’m honored to celebrate and recognize the 
extraordinary work of Harker Heights, TX 
Councilman John Reider. His eighteen years 
of dedication to his beloved city are the reflec-
tion of a true and devoted public servant. 
With his ‘‘can-do’’ spirit and high-minded vi-
sion, John is a trusted community leader. He 
brought his tremendous work ethic and com-
mitment to excellence to every challenge he 
encountered. It’s public servants like him that 
make Harker Heights the welcoming, success-
ful city that it is. 
While John isn’t tired of the privilege of pub-
lic service, he knows that everything has its 
season and the time has come to allow the 
next generation of leaders to take the stage. 
Stepping away from his office won’t give him 
much idle time as he remains a vital part of 
the Central Texas community, operating a 
successful property management company 
with his beloved family. 
Retirement is meant to be celebrated and 
enjoyed. It is not the end of a career, but the 
beginning of a new adventure. It is my honor 
to recognize the selfless service of John 
Reider as he starts this new chapter of his life. 
On behalf of Central Texas, I thank him for his 
superb work and wish him the very best.

HONORING EDWARD CARTWRIGHT 
MOORE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a treasured member of my staff, 
Edward Cartwright Moore, on the occasion of 
his retirement on January 15, 2021, after over 
30 years in my office. Cartwright, my longest- 
serving staff member, has been a dedicated 
public servant for nearly his entire career. I 
have been honored to know him since the first 
day he stepped into my congressional cam-
paign office in 1990, when I had just been 
elected and before I had any staff. Cartwright 
got to work before day one of my first term in 
the House, and he has been unstoppable 
since. 
Cartwright, born in Ann Arbor, Michigan to 
Margaret and Edward Moore in 1954, has 
over the years become a go-to staffer for gen-
eral casework and for his expertise on immi-
gration and LGBTQIA issues. 
Recently, for example, Cartwright was inte-
gral in assisting a District of Columbia family 
stranded in India during a trip to renew their 
H1–B Visas. While a shoutout in a Wash-
ington Post article stated ‘‘Del. Eleanor 
Holmes Norton (D–D.C.) made some noise to 
bring her constituents back,’’ it was Cart-
wright’s work behind the scenes, spending 
hours working to ensure the family returned 
home to D.C. safely, that deserved the credit. 
Cartwright is meticulous, caring and humble. 
He also keeps other staffers on their toes with 
his witty, unexpected replies to everyday 
questions like, ‘‘How are you?’’ 
Cartwright graduated from Hiram College, 
where he studied history, in 1979. He then at-
tended law school at Case Western University, 
where he studied labor law. He passed the 
bar in both Ohio and North Carolina, and 
worked on various political campaigns, picking 
up a range of expertise along the way. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring Edward 
Cartwright Moore on his 30 years of out-
standing work on behalf of D.C. residents and 
our country.

HONORING LONNIE G. BUNCH III, 
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSO-
NIAN INSTITUTION AND A MEM-
BER OF THE 5000 ROLE MODELS 
OF EXCELLENCE PROJECT 
HON. FREDERICA S. WILSON 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Lonnie G. Bunch III, sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, where he 
oversees 19 museums, 21 libraries, the Na-
tional Zoo, numerous research centers, and 
several education units and centers. He is the 
first-ever African American to serve in this 
role. 
Mr. Bunch, who grew up in Belleville, New 
Jersey, discovered early on his passion for the 
study of history and was greatly influenced by 
his grandfather. He regularly cites a conversa-
tion with him as a pivotal moment that shaped 
his career trajectory. While surveying a photo-
graph labeled Unidentified Children, Bunch’s 
grandfather mused to young Lonnie, ‘‘Isn’t it a 
shame [for them] to live their lives, die, just to 
be listed as anonymous?’’ Consequently, he 
challenges himself to ‘‘make visible the invis-
ible’’ and ‘‘give voice to the anonymous.’’ 
From 1983 to 1989, Bunch served as the 
curator of history and program manager for 
the California African American Museum in 
Los Angeles, where he organized award-win-
ning exhibitions highlighting black Olympians 
and African Americans in Los Angeles. Be-
tween 1989 and 2000, he held several posi-
tions at the Smithsonian, including associate 
director for curatorial affairs at the National 
Museum of American History, during which he 
oversaw the development of a major perma-
nent exhibition on the American presidency. 
As president of the Chicago Historical Soci-
ety from 2001 to 2005, Bunch developed an 
acclaimed exhibition on teenage life titled 
Teen Chicago and launched an outreach ini-
tiative to increase museum attendance by di-
verse communities.

January 12, 2021 
Before serving in his current role, Bunch 
was director of the Smithsonian’s National Mu-
seum of African American History and Culture. 
Under his watch, the museum grew from a 
project with no staff, collections, funding, or 
site, to become a cornerstone of American 
history and culture that has welcomed more 
than six million visitors since its opening and 
houses a collection of 40,000 objects. It is the 
largest museum devoted exclusively to exam-
ining and teaching African American history 
and its impact on the nation and the world. 
He has served on the advisory boards of 
the American Association of Museums and the 
American Association for State and Local His-
tory. In 2002, President George W. Bush ap-
pointed him to the Committee for the Preser-
vation of the White House, to which he was 
reappointed by President Barack Obama in 
2010. In 2005, the American Association of 
Museums named him one of the 100 most in-
fluential museum professionals of the 20th 
century. Bunch also received the Freedom 
Medal from the Roosevelt Institute, the W.E.B. 
Du Bois Medal from the Hutchins Center at 
Harvard University, and the National Equal 
Justice Award from the NAACP’s Legal De-
fense Fund. In addition, he will be inducted 
into the 5000 Role Models at its 28th Annual 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Scholarship Break-
fast on Monday, January 18, 2021. 
Bunch has published numerous books, in-
cluding tomes on the black military experi-
ence, the American presidency, and all-black 
towns in the American West. As Mr. Bunch 
has said: ‘‘You can’t be a historian of black 
America without being hopeful. Because this is 
a group of people who, in many ways, be-
lieved in a country that didn’t believe in them. 
So, for me, there is always hope.’’ 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Lonnie G. Bunch III, who helps us all draw 
hope from our history, even its darkest mo-
ments, and has ensured that our great Smith-
sonian institutions give voice to stories that 
might otherwise would be lost to history.

IN HONOR OF RAYMOND ‘‘RED’’ 
GOULET’S 98TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Raymond ‘‘Red’’ Goulet, who is cele-
brating his 98th birthday this Thursday, Janu-
ary 14, 2021. A World War II veteran and 
longtime resident of Portsmouth, Mr. Goulet is 
beloved among many members of the commu-
nity. Due to COVID–19 precautions, however, 
Mr. Goulet cannot celebrate his birthday with 
friends and loved ones. 
During World War II, Mr. Goulet and his two 
brothers enlisted in the U.S. Army, where he 
served as an Army technical sergeant. He 
landed on Omaha Beach on D–Day, and to 
this day, still carries the same wallet he had 
that day as an enduring reminder of the brav-
ery and patriotism of so many Americans dur-
ing those trying times. 
Mr. Goulet has served as a Pease Greeter 
for many years, doing so to make sure that 
our servicemembers know how much they are 
appreciated. Mr. Goulet has also forged a 
strong relationship with the Portsmouth Police 
Department, and in 2017, was honored by 
them with a special luncheon. Outgoing and 
affable, Mr. Goulet makes an impact wherever 
he goes, and all those who know him recount 
on his knack for making everyone around him 
feel valued. 
Because of how much Mr. Goulet means to 
the community, friends and even strangers 
across New Hampshire have mobilized to 
make sure that Mr. Goulet receives many 
cards and notes of support on his birthday. 
And while cards cannot fully replace spending 
time with loved ones and friends, I hope all of 
these notes will show Mr. Goulet that so many 
people are thinking about him even as we all 
cannot be physically together. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
wish Mr. Goulet a very happy birthday. I hope 
that he will be able to celebrate many more 
milestones in the coming years, and I want to 
thank him for his service to our country and 
his dedication to our community.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF PENN-
SYLVANIA STATE REPRESENTA-
TIVE MIKE REESE 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of Pennsylvania State 
Representative Mike Reese, who passed 
away on January 2, 2021, at the age of 42. 
Representative Reese was a loving husband 
to his wife, Angela, father, mentor, and role 
model to his children Addison, Michael, and 
Claire, and friend to many in our region and 
across the Commonwealth. 
A lifelong Pennsylvanian, Representative 
Reese graduated from Duquesne University 
and obtained a Master’s in Business Adminis-
tration from Seton Hill University. Prior to his 
service in the state legislature, Representative 
Reese taught and served as an administrator 
at local schools and institutes of higher edu-
cation in southwestern Pennsylvania. He also 
held the position of Chief of Staff for former 
Westmoreland County Commissioners Terry 
Marolt and Phil Light and assistant director 
and financial administrator for Westmoreland 
County. 
In 2008, Representative Reese was elected 
to represent the 59th Legislative District in the 
Pennsylvania House of Representatives, serv-
ing portions of Westmoreland and Somerset 
Counties. Throughout his service, Representa-
tive Reese was a tireless advocate for the 
people of southwestern Pennsylvania. His 
hard work and dedication did not go unno-
ticed, and he held several leadership roles, in-
cluding Republican Caucus Secretary and Re-
publican Caucus Chairman. 
Madam Speaker, it is with profound sadness 
that I recognize the loss of State Representa-
tive Mike Reese. Representative Reese’s ac-
complishments and legacy will leave a lasting 
impact on the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, and he will be greatly missed by his 
family, friends, and community. 
REMEMBERING MARSHALL MCKAY 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Marshall McKay and 
his legacy as a champion of Native American 
heritage and the rights of indigenous people in 
his community and around the world. My wife 
Patti and I are devastated to learn of Marshall 
McKay’s passing, who died of COVID–19. 
Born in Colusa, California, to a renowned 
Native American healer and basket weaver, 
Mr. McKay was the first person from his family 
to attend college. Following his graduation 
from Sonoma State University, he worked for 
the U.S. Department of Defense repairing and 
maintaining nuclear submarines for 15 years. 
Following his service, he became a founding 
member of the Native Arts and Cultures Foun-
dation and was appointed to the Smithsonian 
Institution’s Board of the National Museum of 
the American Indian, which stands just a few 
blocks from this chamber. 
In addition, Mr. McKay served on the Yocha 
Dehe Tribal Council from 1984 to 2015. His 
dedication to the work of the council cul-
minated in a decade of service as its chair-
man. During that time, the tribe was a key 
partner with the local community on several 
fronts and a benefactor to many local non-
profits. Through his many roles, Mr. McKay 
championed the environment and fought for 
tribal land-use rights. 
His life’s work has had an indelible positive 
impact on his tribe, our state, and the nation. 
He was a beloved member of our community, 
and he will be deeply missed. Our hearts are 
with Marshall McKay’s family, loved ones, and 
tribe during this difficult time.

tures that led to an acceleration in revenue 
and growth. In addition, he has served as 
president of the African American Chamber of 
Commerce of Central Florida, where he super-
vised organizations and businesses in six dif-
ferent counties. Secretary Davis also co- 
founded a private business that offers youth 
sporting programs and professional training 
services. He was named one of the Top 15

the Seminoles’ football team. In his spare 
time, Secretary Davis enjoys volunteering for 
the United Way, Valencia College, Volunteer

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
PROSECUTOR 
HOME RULE ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Prosecutor 
Home Rule Act of 2021 to give District of Co-
lumbia residents another important element of 
self-government that does not require state-
hood and is enjoyed by all other Americans, 
including those in the U.S. territories. The bill 
would establish a local prosecutor’s office des-
ignated under local law to prosecute all local 
crimes in the District. Under federal law, the 
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colum-
bia, a federal entity, is responsible for pros-
ecuting most local crimes committed by adults 
here, which is the greater part of its caseload, 
in addition to prosecuting federal crimes. This 
bill is special because it effectuates a 2002 
advisory referendum, approved by 82 percent 
of D.C. voters, to create a local prosecutor’s 
office. 
There is no law enforcement issue of great-
er importance to D.C. residents on which they 
have less say than the prosecution of local 
crimes here. A U.S. Attorney has no business 
prosecuting the local crimes of a jurisdiction, 
an anachronism that is a holdover from when 
the District had no home rule and that is out 
of place in any American self-governing juris-
diction. In fact, the territories of the United 
States—Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern 
Mariana Islands—have the authority to pros-
ecute all local crimes in their jurisdictions. A 
local D.C. prosecutor is long overdue, placing 
the District behind all other U.S. jurisdictions. 
The goal of this bill is to give the District the 
same jurisdiction over the criminal matters that 
state, local and territorial jurisdictions justifi-
ably regard as mandatory. 
Amending federal law to create a local pros-
ecutor would be an important step toward our 
goal of achieving true self-government in the 
District. I urge my colleagues to support this 
important measure.

HONORING ANTHONY SAMPSON 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Anthony Sampson, a local busi-
ness owner and influential financial advisor, 
for his exemplary service and commitment to 
the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex. Anthony is 
an active figure in the North Texas community. 
His achievements span decades, and his on-
going involvement in the community is visible 
in many aspects. Beginning his professional 
career with Allstate in 1983, Anthony quickly 
rose through the ranks and held several man-
agement positions. While growing with All-
state, he achieved over two dozen prestigious 
awards. In 1993, Anthony opened Sampson 
Financial 
Services, 
Inc./Allstate 
Insurance 
Agency in Arlington, TX and continues to lead 
his team to bring reassurance and stability to 
our community. Anthony is an active leader in 
the African American community and is com-
mitted to empowering youth through vol-
unteerism and community service. He helped 
found ‘‘100 Black Men of Greater Dallas-Fort 
Worth’’ to show young people how great their 
future can be. The hard work and spirit shown 
by him is an outstanding example of American 
success and ingenuity. 
Anthony is a dedicated leader and mentor in 
our community; his commitment to the devel-
opment of North Texans should be com-
mended and remembered. By honoring An-
thony Sampson, our Dallas Fort Worth, Texas 
residents will recognize his leadership and 
commitment to the betterment of our North 
Texas community and country.

REMEMBERING RICHARD 
ROMINGER 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Richard Rominger 
and his legacy as a champion of rural commu-
nities and American farmers. Patti and I are 
deeply saddened by Richard’s passing, and 
our hearts are with Evelyn and their family 
during this difficult time. I called Rich’s cell 
phone the morning he passed away. He did 
not answer. I’ve called that number hundreds 
of times seeking advice and counsel, and I 
have always come away from the conversa-
tion with a gem of wisdom, a better solution to 
a problem, encouragement, and a precious gift 
of friendship. Not this time. My call was an-
swered 
by 
his 
son 
confirming 
Richard 
Rominger’s death. I’ll keep Rich’s number. He 
won’t answer, but just calling will encourage 
me to stay true to the lessons he taught me. 
I know that Rich treated everyone with the 
same respect and desire to help. Perhaps 
they will keep that number, too. 
Richard and Evelyn Rominger served in 
President Bill Clinton’s administration with 
Patti and I. Richard was Deputy Secretary of 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Patti 
ran the Foreign Agriculture Service’s food and 
famine programs. Richard was always the bul-
wark of support for the American family farm-
er. He knew the challenges facing farm fami-
lies, and he knew how to use government to 
improve their lot. During the Clinton years the 
Department of Agriculture and Department of 
Interior, where I was also Deputy, teamed up 
to produce seminal studies on the effects of 
Climate Change, create the first Tahoe Sum-
mit, address droughts, support land conserva-
tion efforts nationwide, attack invasive spe-
cies, and protect America’s great forest. 
Governor Jerry Brown recognized Richard’s 
potential as a problem solver when he ap-
pointed Richard to serve as the Secretary of 
the California Department of Agriculture. A 
problem-solver was necessary with Medflies, 
drought, water wars, and agricultural labor 
problems in abundance. Undaunted by these 
challenges, Rominger steered a wise course 
that yielded a bumper crop of solutions. 
Following his time in government, Richard 
returned to Winters—where he was raised—to 
continue his work supporting the U.S. agri-
culture 
industry. 
Richard 
was 
named 
Agriculturalist of the Year by the California 
State Fair and received a Distinguished Serv-
ice Award from the California Farm Bureau 
Federation for his lifelong commitment to the 
agricultural community. 
Richard was a dear friend for whom I have 
the deepest respect and admiration. His life’s 
work has had an indelible positive impact on 
our state and nation, and he will be deeply 
missed. Patti and I send our condolences to 
Evelyn and the Rominger family.

Ms. WILSON of Florida. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and commend Mayor 
Daniella Levine Cava on the occasion of her 
historic election as the first female Mayor of 
Miami-Dade County, Florida. 
Daniella Levine Cava was sworn in as 
Mayor of Miami-Dade County on Tuesday, No-
vember 17, 2020, making history as the first 
woman to do so. Prior to her historic election, 
she served as the Miami-Dade County Com-
missioner representing District 8, first elected 
in 2014, and re-elected in 2018. Her district in-
cluded Palmetto Bay, Cutler Bay, Homestead, 
and unincorporated areas of South Miami- 
Dade including Redland, Falls, Princeton, 
Naranja, Leisure City and parts of West Ken-
dall. 
While a member of the Miami-Dade County 
Commission, she served on the following 
Committees: Transportation and Finance; In-
frastructure and Capital Improvements; Public 
Safety and Rehabilitation; and the Community 
Disparities Subcommittee of the Chair’s Policy 
Council. She also served on the Transpor-
tation Planning Organization and the Execu-
tive Board of the South Florida Regional Plan-
ning Council.

Additionally as a Commissioner, her efforts 
focused on delivering on a variety of issues 
like: Fighting for a fair share of resources for 
South Miami-Dade, increasing the County po-
lice force by 80 officers, expanding economic 
opportunity, championing parks and the envi-
ronment, advocating for transit improvements 
and better planning, and hosting the annual 
South Dade Solutions Summit. She secured 
over $30 million in funds for infrastructure 
projects in South Miami-Dade. 
Mayor Levine Cava came to elected office 
after having served as an advocate for South 
Florida families for over 30 years. She served 
special needs children and immigrants at 
Legal Services of Greater Miami, and then 
represented children in the child welfare sys-
tem as Associate and Legal Director for the 
Guardian Ad Litem Program. 
Madam Speaker, in the aftermath of dev-
astating Hurricane Andrew, she was recruited 
to create a new intake system for child abuse 
cases with the Florida Department of Children 
and Families. Her efforts were concentrated 
on the neighborhoods of Miami-Dade County’s 
District 8, where she helped restore the lives 
and homes of those devastated by the storm. 
In 1996, Mayor Levine Cava founded the 
social service organization Catalyst Miami, to 
help low- and middle-income families through

proximately 5,000 people each year to be-
come more self-sufficient.

Cava has done in the community also includes 
service with notable organizations like the 
Florida Bar Committee on Legal Needs of 
Children; the boards of League of Women 
Voters, Orange Bowl Foundation, North Dade 
Medical Foundation, South Florida Health In-
formation 
Initiative, 
and 
several

her impact on the community by numerous or-
ganizations including: the Commission on Eth-
ics, Red Cross, American Society for Public

America, Mayor Daniella received her bach-
elor’s degree in psychology with honors from 
Yale University and graduate degrees in law

her husband, Dr. Robert Cava, a Miami native, 
who returned home to join his father in med-
ical practice. Mayor Levine Cava and her hus-
band raised two children, Eliza and Edward 
Cava. 
Madam Speaker, I urge you, my colleagues 
in Congress, and all Americans to join me in 
honoring Mayor Daniella Levine Cava for her 
historic election as the first female Mayor of 
Miami-Dade County, Florida and her dedica-
tion and commitment to her community and 
our great nation.

OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, I was ab-

Call number 9.

INTRODUCTION OF COUP ACT 
HON. JAMAAL BOWMAN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 12, 2021 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to share that I am introducing legislation to 
create a national commission to investigate 
the attempted insurrection on January 6th, and 
root out ties between white supremacists, 
white nationalists, and Capitol Police. 
How 
did 
a 
group 
of 
armed, 
violent 
seditionists march into one of the most secure 
buildings, forcing Members of Congress to 
hide under their desks? What did the authori-
ties know, and when did they know it? We 
need a national commission that will dig into 
the facts and openly share findings with the 
public. 
What was abundantly clear last week was 
the stark contrast between the scarce and 
under-equipped security when insurrectionists 
stormed the Capitol—and how law enforce-
ment agencies in D.C. and across the country 
rallied resources to brutalize and suppress 
demonstrators who were protesting in defense 
of Black lives and the lives of disabled people. 
But what we saw last week is not new—it is 
a continuation of the American tradition of 
white backlash in the wake of social progress. 
And in this moment, I know that my col-
leagues and I will rise to the challenge and 
work to help our country heal. But none of this 
reconciliation can happen without truth and 
justice first. 
As long as we allow white supremacy to 
continue to thrive in our society and our insti-
tutions, we will continue to suffer the con-
sequences at the hands of its adherents. This 
is why it is so important that we pass my bill, 
the Congressional Oversight of Unjust Policing 
Act. My bill is the first step in the difficult task 
of investigating the failures in leadership and 
security that led up to the deadly events of 
January 6, 2021, and rooting out white su-
premacy in our law enforcement. 
I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this leg-
islation, and join me in moving it to full pas-
sage.
