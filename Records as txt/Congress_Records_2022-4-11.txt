PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
We pray, O God, this morning for all 
those in our communities, our country, 
and throughout the world who feel 
abandoned by You. They are discour-
aged as there are no easy answers 
forthcoming. There appears no reason 
for hope. 
In Your compassion, gather them in. 
May those who feel estranged from 
their families find relationships re-
stored. May those who struggle to 
make ends meet, find the abundance of 
Your grace. And may those who are 
threatened by the caprice of conflict 
find shelter in Your divine care. 
Reveal to us again Your everlasting 
love. 
Restore to us once more the cer-
tainty of Your steadfast faithfulness. 
Redeem our world that injustice and 
enmity would find nowhere to thrive. 
Then may we build on Your founda-
tion of righteousness and establish a 
world free of oppression and without 
fear of terror. For You, O Lord, have 
promised to be near to us forever. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

CELEBRATING THE 90TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE FRANKLIN D. ROO-
SEVELT DEMOCRATIC CLUB 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is my dis-
tinct pleasure to congratulate the members of 
the Hammond, Indiana Franklin D. Roosevelt 
(FDR) Democratic Club as they celebrate the 
organization’s 90th anniversary. In honor of 
this momentous occasion, the FDR Club will 
be hosting an anniversary banquet on April 
30, 2022, at the Hammond Mohawk Athletic & 
Conservation Club. 
The Franklin D. Roosevelt Club of Ham-
mond was founded by forty-two members of 
Polish ancestry on December 3, 1932. Since 
the time of its founding, the club’s members 
set out to engage in the promotion and ad-
vancement of civic progress within the Demo-
cratic Party. Since its inception, club members 
have selflessly given their time and support to 
the community of Northwest Indiana. The resi-
dents of Northwest Indiana are grateful for the 
club’s ‘‘Candidates’ Night,’’ which is held prior 
to each primary and general election. This is 
an outstanding opportunity for voters to meet 
candidates and discuss the needs of their 
community. For their significant contributions 
to upholding the ideals of the democratic proc-
ess in their communities and throughout 
Northwest Indiana, the members and leaders 
of the FDR Club are to be commended. 
At this time, I would like to acknowledge the 
2020 FDR Club Officers. They are: President 
Suzette Kubacki, First Vice President Lee 
Ward, Second Vice President Anna Mamala, 
Secretary Mark Szpak, Treasurer Ted Oberc, 
and 
Trustees 
Rich 
Chmielik, 
Mary 
T. 
Hildebranski, and Brian Krupinski. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in con-
gratulating the Hammond Franklin D. Roo-
sevelt Democratic Club on its 90th anniver-
sary. The work of this truly admirable organi-
zation is a great asset to the people of North-
west Indiana, and for their selfless service, the 
leadership and members are worthy of the 
highest praise, and I am proud to serve as 
their representative in Washington, D.C.

HONORING INDIANA STATE REP-
RESENTATIVE 
DOUG 
GUTWEIN 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO HOOSIERS 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Indiana State Representative 
Doug Gutwein on his remarkable career in 
service to our state and nation as he prepares 
to retire this year. Representative Gutwein, 
who represents Indiana House District 16, has 
dedicated his life to making his fellow Hoo-
siers safer, stronger, and more prosperous. 
A lifelong Hoosier, Representative Gutwein 
was born and raised in Francesville. After 
graduating from high school, he served in the 
United States Army. He returned to Pulaski 
County to run his brother’s small business, 
which he later acquired. 
In 1991, Representative Gutwein began his 
career in public service as a member of the 
Francesville Town Board and he was elected 
president of the board in 1992. 
First elected to the Indiana State House of 
Representatives 
in 
2008, 
Representative 
Gutwein quickly began delivering results for 
Hoosiers. 
During his tenure, he has served as a lead-
er in expanding newborn screenings and safe-
guarding the most vulnerable Hoosiers. Rep-
resentative Gutwein has sponsored legislation, 
including both Graham’s Law and Bryce’s Bill, 
to update and expand the list of screenings 
newborns receive in Indiana shortly after 
birth—increasing awareness of conditions and 
saving lives. 
Representative Gutwein also introduced leg-
islation to address flooding and drainage 
issues along the Kankakee and Yellow rivers 
by the Kankakee River Basin and Yellow River 
Basin Commission, which will have long-last-
ing benefits for our region. 
As a veteran, Representative Gutwein has 
remained active in advocating for his fellow 
veterans and supporting our troops. He led 
legislative solutions to equip Hoosier veterans 
with resources, improve communication with 
the veteran community, and cut taxes for our 
heroes. In addition to his work in the State As-
sembly, Representative Gutwein also is an ac-
tive member of the American Legion and con-
tinues to fight every day for his fellow vet-
erans. He has been instrumental in sending 
Indiana-grown popcorn to American troops to 
share a taste of home. 
Throughout his time at the Statehouse, Rep-
resentative Gutwein has been a strong leader 
for agriculture, small business, and other vital 
Hoosier priorities. He also served as chairman 
of the Environmental Affairs Committee, the 
Employment, Labor and Pensions Committee, 
and the Select Committee on Government Re-
duction. 
Representative Gutwein and his wife, Mary 
Lew, have been blessed with three children 
and seven grandchildren. The entire Gutwein 
family is a cherished part of our Pulaski Coun-
ty community. 
On behalf of the 2nd District of Indiana, it is 
my privilege to honor State Representative 
Doug Gutwein for his distinguished service to 
Hoosiers and Americans across the country. 
As he prepares to retire from the Indiana State 
House of Representatives, I wish Representa-
tive Gutwein and his family all the best in the 
chapters ahead. 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
RABBI 
MENACHEM 
M. 
SCHNEERSON 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and include 
in the RECORD the words of Rabbi Mendel 
Alperowitz of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, hon-
oring the life and legacy of Rabbi Menachem 
M. Schneerson. 
Remarks by Rabbi Mendel Alperowitz: 
Today we recognize the life and leadership 
of 
the 
global 
spiritual 
leader 
Rabbi 
Menachem M. Schneerson, known univer-
sally as ‘‘the Rebbe’’ and head of the Chabad- 
Lubavitch movement. 
Rabbi Schneerson arrived with his wife, 
Rebbetzin Chaya Mushka Schneerson, to our 
shores in 1941 from the Nazi inferno, just as 
our nation was celebrating our independence 
on July 4—a bearded, Yiddish-speaking, 
childless and penniless Soviet emigre. 
Yet, without the benefit of material re-
sources or political power, only the force of 
his convictions, a selfless dedication to the 
Supreme Being and to every human being, 
the Rebbe resuscitated and guided a demor-
alized and depleted world Jewry to rebuild 
and even to flourish after the Holocaust. 
Though he came to this country with noth-
ing, through his work the Rebbe became the 
most influential rabbi in modern history. 
One result of his leadership is the Chabad- 
Lubavitch movement, which, by following 
his teachings and example, became the 
world’s largest Jewish educational organiza-
tion. Today there are more than 3,500 perma-
nent Chabad-Lubavitch centers providing 
educational, religious, and humanitarian 
programming, serving people in all 50 States, 
including in my home state of South Dakota, 
and in over 100 countries around the world. 
The Rebbe’s message to all peoples every-
where in the world community calls for fo-
cusing serious concern on the values of edu-
cation and acts of charity, to provide an edu-
cation which is imbued with ethical, moral 
and spiritual values. The recognition that 
there is ‘‘an Eye that Sees and an Ear that 
Hears,’’—that all humankind is accountable 
to the Creator who provided us with the only 
true guide for life. The Rebbe teaches that 
these moral and ethical values, as enshrined 
in the Seven Laws given to Noah, must be an 
integral part of any educational system if 
humankind is to live in harmony with a fel-
low human and if humanity is to realize G- 
ds expectation of her or him. When does this 
education begin? The moment life starts. 
When does education end? It never does. 
The 
Rebbe 
always 
extolled 
America’s 
unique role and mission on the world stage 
and had meaningful relationships with sev-
eral of our nation’s leaders who saw him as 
the moral guide to so many. For the Rebbe, 
America was a beacon of light with a his-
toric prominence to be utilized in influ-
encing the betterment of all humanity. The 
Rebbe called America ‘‘a nation of kindness’’ 
and pointed to the words ‘‘In God We Trust’’ 
enshrined on all American currency as a de-
fining element of the great American story.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E376 
April 11, 2022 
It is to the eternal merit of our country 
and this august body that we honored the 
Rebbe’s outstanding and enduring contribu-
tions toward world education, morality, and 
acts of charity, by awarding him the Con-
gressional Gold Medal posthumously. His ef-
forts for the betterment of education for all 
Americans are also recognized annually by 
the President of the United States, marking 
Education and Sharing Day USA each year 
on his birthday, calling on all Americans to 
reflect and act on the critical importance of 
moral and ethical education, especially for 
our youth. 
This year, our country will celebrate Edu-
cation and Sharing Day on April 12, cor-
responding to the llth day of Nissan on the 
Jewish calendar. This year is a milestone 
year when we celebrate the 120th anniver-
sary of the Rebbe’s birth. 
As our minds and hearts are never far from 
the people of Ukraine and the brutal war 
they are enduring, it is surely Providential 
to recognize and reflect on the life lessons of 
someone so exceptional, who was himself 
born and raised in Ukraine. 
The Rebbe was born in Nikolaev, Ukraine 
in 
1902. 
to 
Rabbi 
Levi 
Yitzchak 
and 
Rebbetzin Chana Schneerson. His family 
moved to Yekatrinislav, now Dinepr, where 
his father served as Chief Rabbi. During the 
Bolshevik revolution the Rebbe’s childhood 
home became the epicenter for the many ref-
ugees flocking through Dinepr. In an act of 
love and sacrifice, the Rebbe, though only a 
child, gave away his own bed and food to 
allow those he had never met before to have 
a more comfortable and dignified life. That 
was the example his parents set. This was 
the life he lived. 
His mother would recall that once, when 
the family was in hiding during a brutal po-
grom, the Rebbe who was three years old at 
the time, walked around the cellar of a phar-
macy, and consoled and calmed the other 
terrified children who were hiding there. 
Later when he was nine years old, the Rebbe 
dived into the Black Sea to save the life of 
a boy who had fallen from the deck of a 
moored ship. The adult onlookers didn’t feel 
confident enough to jump in. Those who wit-
nessed this heroic act recalled the sacrifice 
the Rebbe had made that day. He himself 
collapsed, almost lifeless, soon after bringing 
the young boy to shore. 
These 
stories 
are 
emblematic 
of 
the 
Rebbe’s life; the sacrifice and deep sense of 
responsibility for all who cry out for help. 
The call of those drowning and no one hear-
ing their cries. For people calling out for 
moral guidance in a world engulfed in dark-
ness, the Rebbe rose to this historic calling 
offering guidance and leadership, 
The Rebbe grew up under the oppression of 
communism, his father stood firm, dis-
playing courage and sacrifice, leading his 
family and community in the Jewish reli-
gious resistance across Ukraine. 
From his humble one room office in New 
York, the Rebbe built and maintained a clan-
destine network of operatives throughout 
the USSR. Young couples were inspired by 
his teachings, and he sent them to make 
what was then significant sacrifices for west-
ern raised kids, to devote themselves com-
pletely to the needs of others, in foreign 
lands. 
With the fall of communism, the Rebbe 
was able to ensure that those underground 
activities sprouted forth and quickly devel-
oped thriving Jewish communities, creating 
unprecedented Jewish infrastructure, serving 
hundreds of communities across the USSR, 
and resulting in the golden era of Ukrainian 
Jewry for the last 30 years. 
Right now, during the current Russia- 
Ukraine war, it is the hundreds of Chabad- 
Lubavitch representatives of the Rebbe, and 
their thousands of employees and volunteers, 
who are at the forefront of the humani-
tarian, social and religious efforts being pro-
vided for the refugees and their loved ones 
left behind. 
Overnight they have transformed their 
schools, synagogues, and orphanages into 
centers for humanitarian relief, shelters, and 
call centers. 
The Rebbe’s message is clear and serves as 
an important calling for all of us. We must 
put ourselves aside and be ready to sacrifice 
for the needs of others. With this urgent 
sense of responsibility and love, we will 
make the world a better place. This is what 
the Rebbe’s people are doing in Ukraine. 
This is the life he exemplified. This is what 
we can all do.

HON. KAT CAMMACK 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to recognize Mr. Joey Mantia on the re-
markable achievement of winning a Bronze 
Medal for speedskating in the Men’s Team 
Pursuit at the 2022 Winter Olympics. I com-
mend Mr. Mantia and his teammates for the 
commitment, hard work, and effort dedicated 
to this hard-fought victory, what an honor it is 
to be able to represent the United States of 
America at such a level. As a 28-time world 
champion and world recordholder, he knows 
the hard work and dedication it takes. May he 
continue to make Florida and our country 
proud with his persistence. 
I am proud to recognize Ms. Erin Jackson 
on winning the Gold Medal in the Women’s 
500m Short Track Speed Skate at the 2022 
Winter Olympics. This victory is well deserved, 
as I know it reflects the hard work and dedica-
tion Ms. Jackson has put in throughout her 
life. Not only does Ms. Jackson hold the title 
as a gold medalist, but as the first black 
woman to medal in speedskating at the Winter 
Olympics and the first American to win this 
event since 1994. May she continue to make 
Florida and our country proud with her persist-
ence. 
I am proud to recognize Ms. Brittany Bowe 
on winning the Bronze Medal in the Women’s 
1000m Long Track Speed Skate at the 2022 
Winter Olympic Games. I commend Ms. Bowe 
for the commitment, hard work, and effort she 
put into this hard-fought victory. As the winner 
of gold and silver medals at the World Single 
Distance Championship, she knows the hard 
work and dedication is what it takes to get to 
where you are today. May she continue to 
make Florida and our country proud with her 
persistence. 
I am proud to recognize the 100th anniver-
sary of the Gainesville chapter of the National 
Society Daughters of the American Revolution. 
The Gainesville chapter was founded on April 
2, 1922 to promote historic preservation, edu-
cation, and patriotism. I am happy to recog-
nize all the good that the Gainesville chapter 
does in their community. Members volunteer 
in their local communities including supporting 
active-duty military personnel and assisting 
veteran patients, awarding scholarships and fi-
nancial aid each year to students, and sup-
porting schools for underserved children. 
Here’s to the next 100 years.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
FORMER STATE SENATOR GLO-
RIA TANNER 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today along with my colleagues, Congressman 
ED PERLMUTTER, Congressman JOE NEGUSE, 
and Congressman JASON CROW, to recognize 
the life and achievements of former Colorado 
State Senator Gloria Tanner, who passed 
away on Monday, April 4, 2022, at the age of 
86. Gloria was a courageous leader who dedi-
cated her life to improving the lives of other 
Coloradans. She was also a friend and mentor 
to so many in the Denver community, includ-
ing all of us. 
Before Gloria’s trailblazing record of service 
began in Colorado, her life’s journey started in 
Atlanta, Georgia, where she was born on July 
16, 1934. Decades later, the chance to earn a 
living while attending school brought her to 
Colorado. In 1972, Gloria became a reporter 
at the Denver Weekly News, which at the time 
was a prominent African American newspaper. 
While working as a reporter, Gloria deter-
minedly pursued her education goals—first at 
Denver’s Metropolitan State College where 
she graduated magna cum laude with a de-
gree in political science, and then later at the 
University of Colorado where she earned her 
master’s degree in Urban Affairs. 
Gloria’s celebrated career included many 
historic firsts, including serving as the state’s 
first African American woman elected to the 
State Senate and the second African Amer-
ican woman elected to a leadership position in 
the State House of Representatives. 
In 1976, after graduation, Gloria worked for 
Colorado’s then Lieutenant Governor George 
Brown, a historic figure in his own right, and 
later for Colorado State Senator George Groff 
in 1978. In 1985, Gloria was elected to the 
Colorado House of Representatives, where 
she quickly rose through the ranks of leader-
ship, eventually serving as the Democratic 
caucus’s minority leader. Then in 1994, when 
Senator Groff retired, Gloria was appointed to 
replace him in the State Senate and spent her 
remaining years representing her beloved Dis-
trict 33. 
What made Gloria so special was her re-
lentless drive to serve and uplift the voices of 
those who our society often has difficulty hear-
ing. Throughout her 17 years in the legisla-
ture, Gloria fought tirelessly for civil rights, 
successfully passing several landmark pieces 
of legislation aimed at improving the lives of 
women, families, workers, and minority com-
munities in Colorado. And that drive was, in 
part, what made her an effective advocate in 
the community outside of the state capitol. Not 
only did she found the Colorado Black Women 
for Political Action, an organization that still 
thrives today, but she also co-founded the 
Colorado Black Roundtable, the National Or-
ganization of Black Elected Legislators— 
Women (or NOBEL-Women), as well as the 
Gloria Tanner Leadership and Training Insti-
tute for Future Black Women Leaders of Colo-
rado.

Throughout her career, Gloria acted as a 
friend and mentor to many, including me. 
When I was elected to the State House in 
1992, she was a source of legislative wisdom 
and personal support to me and my family. 
Even after her retirement from the Senate, she 
never hesitated to reach out, particularly to 
young women, with encouragement and wise 
counsel. 
Even when she received well-deserved hon-
ors and awards, such as being inducted into 
the Colorado Women’s Hall of Fame, Gloria 
always accepted the recognition with grace 
and the constant urging that we all need to 
keep pushing to do more. And so, as both 
Coloradans and elected officials, the four of us 
recommit ourselves to the noble fight for jus-
tice led by Gloria and by so many other coura-
geous leaders who have gone before her. 
Our hearts go out to Gloria Tanner’s friends 
and family. We are so proud to call Gloria our 
friend and mentor, and we will miss her dear-
ly. Though her loss will be deeply felt in Den-
ver and across the state for many years to 
come, the legacy she has left will forever raise 
the standard for future generations of leaders.

REMEMBERING 
PORT 
CLINTON, 
OHIO’S COMPANY C MEMBERS IN 
HONOR OF NATIONAL FORMER 
POW RECOGNITION DAY 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
at the request of members of the American 
Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Memorial 
Society regarding National Former POW Rec-
ognition Day which took place on April 9th. 
The Society notes that this year it ‘‘commemo-
rates the 80th anniversary of the fall of the Ba-
taan Peninsula in the Philippines and the Start 
of the infamous Bataan Death March.’’ Port 
Clinton, a small city along Lake Erie in my 
District, shared 32 of its sons in Company C, 
only ten of whom returned from the Bataan 
Death March. I am pleased to include in the 
RECORD the history of the March written by 
Mindy Kotler Smith, a member of the Amer-
ican Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Me-
morial Society: 
‘‘Participating in the historic defense of 
the Philippine Islands were 32 men from Port 
Clinton, Ohio. They were members of Com-
pany C of the 192nd Tank Battalion, an Ohio 
National Guard unit federalized in late 1940. 
The 192nd arrived in the Philippines two 
weeks before Imperial Japan began its inva-
sion of the American territory on December 
8, 1941—within hours of Japan’s attack on 
Pearl Harbor. 
‘‘On Dec. 22, 1941, at Lingayen Gulf, the 
192nd earned the distinction of taking part in 
the first ‘tank-versus-tank battle’ of World 
War II. But it was Company C, on December 
31st at Baliuag, that won the first American 
tank battle of the war. At a time when vic-
tories were rare, Company C was celebrated 
stateside. 
‘‘For four months, on Bataan, American 
and Filipino forces put up the first signifi-
cant resistance to Japan’s lightning advance 
though Southeast Asia. Sick, starving, lack-
ing ammunition and without hope of resup-
ply, the American commanders fearing a 
slaughter surrendered their men to the Japa-
nese on April 9, 1942. 
‘‘Within hours, those that did not escape to 
Corregidor—the island fortress in Manila 
Bay—were forced onto the Bataan Death 
March up the full length of the Bataan Pe-
ninsula. The 65-mile trek to a train station 
in 
the 
tropical 
heat 
was 
marked 
by 
unimagined cruelty and murder all while 
food, water, and medicine were withheld by 
their capturers. For the next 24 miles, they 
were packed standing into steaming, fetid 
boxcars. Those still alive were then walked 
several more miles to a makeshift POW 
camp that had only two sources of water for 
some 60,000 POWs. 
‘‘Of the 100 men of Company C, only six 
died in combat or on the March. However, 58 
died as POWs of Japan in the following three 
and one-half years of captivity and slave 
labor. Of the 32 men from Port Clinton, only 
10 returned home. 
‘‘One of the Port Clinton tankers who did 
not 
return 
was 
25-year-old 
Sgt. 
John 
Robinette. He survived the Battle of Bataan 
and the Bataan Death March only to suc-
cumb to starvation and disease on November 
10, 1942 in a POW camp in the Philippines. 
‘‘Please join me in remembering the men 
and women on Bataan who gave so much 
against impossible odds and a relentless 
enemy. My condolences to all those families 
of Company C whose loved ones did not re-
turn. And I humbly thank all those who 
fought against tyranny in the Pacific during 
World War II. Never Forgotten.’’ 
It has been my privilege throughout the 
years to meet with survivors of the Bataan 
Death March who hail from Port Clinton. Most 
recently, in 2017, residents of Port Clinton 
turned out en masse to honor John Kovach, 
Jr. whose remains were returned to his sur-
viving sisters, still deeply moved 75 years 
later. Though all of the men have since 
passed on, Bataan Memorial School bears 
their legacy and yearly honors the men who 
represented the school’s namesake. The lives 
of the men who did not survive along with 
those fortunate to have come home, live in our 
memory, always.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I was un-
avoidably called back to the district. There is 
no reason why we should be importing energy 
from Russia, especially when we could be pro-
ducing enough for us and our allies around 
the world. Had I been present, I would have

INTRODUCTION OF THE CIVIL WAR 
DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON NA-
TIONAL HISTORICAL PARK ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, on the an-
niversary of the week of the start of the Civil 
War, I introduce the Civil War Defenses of 
Washington National Historical Park Act, 
which would recognize and preserve the Civil 
War Defenses of Washington located in the 
District of Columbia, Virginia and Maryland. 
The Defenses of Washington, including forts, 
unarmed batteries and rifle trenches, created 
a ring of protection for the nation’s capital dur-
ing the Civil War. This bill would redesignate 
the 22 Civil War Defenses of Washington cur-
rently under National Park Service jurisdiction 
as a national historical park, and allow other 
sites associated with the Defenses of Wash-
ington that are owned by the District or a unit 
of state governments to be affiliated with the 
national historical park through cooperative 
agreements. This bill would also require the 
Secretary of the Interior to facilitate the storied 
history of the Civil War for both the North and 
the South, including the history of the De-
fenses of Washington and the Shenandoah 
Valley Campaign of 1864, being assembled, 
arrayed and conveyed for the benefit of the 
public for the knowledge, education and inspi-
ration of this and future generations. In 2018, 
the House Natural Resources Committee Sub-
committee on Federal Lands held a hearing 
on this bill. Although the Department of the In-
terior opposed this bill, I feel strongly that the 
Defenses of Washington need additional rec-
ognition and should be redesignated as a na-
tional historical park. 
The Defenses of Washington were con-
structed at the beginning of the war, in 1861, 
as a ring of protection for the nation’s capital 
and for President Abraham Lincoln. By the 
end of the war, these defenses included 68 
forts, 93 unarmed batteries, 807 mounted can-
nons, 13 miles of rifle trenches and 32 miles 
of military roads. The major test of the De-
fenses of Washington came with the Shen-
andoah Valley Campaign of 1864, when Con-
federate Lieutenant General Jubal Early, di-
rected by General Robert E. Lee, sought to at-
tack the nation’s capital from the north, caus-
ing Union forces threatening to attack Rich-
mond, the capital of the Confederacy, to be 
withdrawn. General Early was delayed by 
Union Major General Lew Wallace at the Bat-
tle of Monocacy on July 9, 1864, and was 
stopped at the northern edge of Washington at 
the Battle of Fort Stevens on July 11–12, 
1864. The Shenandoah Valley Campaign 
ended when Union Lieutenant General Philip 
Sheridan defeated General Early at the Battle 
of Cedar Creek, Virginia, on October 19, 1864. 
Nearly all the individual forts in the De-
fenses of Washington—on both sides of the 
Potomac and Anacostia rivers—were involved 
in stopping General Early’s attack, and the 
Battle of Fort Stevens was the second and 
last attempt by the Confederate Army to attack 
Washington. 
Taken together, these battles were pivotal to 
the outcome of the war and the freedom and 
democracy that the war represented for this 
country. It is therefore fitting that we recognize 
the Defenses of Washington by redesignating 
them as a national historical park. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

its 100th Anniversary. In honor of this special 
occasion, the club’s leaders and members will 
be commemorating this milestone with a cere-
mony at Dynasty Banquets in Hammond, Indi-
ana, on Saturday, April 23, 2022. 
The East Chicago Good Fellows Club is one 
of the oldest social organizations in the state 
of Indiana. The group was established in 1922 
and was initially formed as an athletic club 
that held a variety of sporting events. 
Throughout the years, the club has continued 
to host and sponsor numerous sporting and 
charity events in support of the community of 
East Chicago and beyond. In addition, the 
Good Fellows Club is active in their support of 
local youth sports teams and other charitable 
endeavors throughout Northwest Indiana. The 
members and leadership of the Good Fellows 
Club are to be highly praised for their commit-
ment to philanthropy throughout the region, 
and I am happy to celebrate and honor their 
good work. 
At this time, I would like to acknowledge the 
Good Fellows Club Officers: President Joseph 
Fabian, Vice President Richard Peterson, 
Business Manager Eugene Nowacki, Financial 
Secretary Ronald Spudich, Treasurer Jerry 
Kundich, Secretary John Folta, and Sergeant- 
at-Arms Thomas Keough. The club’s Trustees 
are Phillip Fabian, Jason Gore, and James 
McCormick. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other 
distinguished colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating the East Chicago Good Fellows 
Club on its 100th anniversary. For their out-
standing dedication to the community of East 
Chicago and Northwest Indiana, the leaders 
and members of this great organization are to

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
BETTY REID SOSKIN 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of esteemed 
activist and public servant, Betty Reid Soskin, 
upon her retirement from the National Park 
Service. 
Throughout her life and career, Betty has 
demonstrated steadfast dedication to advo-
cacy and service. During World War II, she 
was a file clerk for the Boilermakers Union A– 
36, an all-Black union auxiliary. Betty contin-
ued her community involvement as an active 
voice in protesting the Vietnam War and writ-
ing music about the experiences of the Civil 
Rights Movement. She also held other es-
teemed positions like serving as a delegate to 
the 1972 Democratic National Convention, leg-
islative aide for a Berkley City Councilmember, 
and field representative for two California 
State Assemblymembers. 
In 2000 when the Rosie the Riveter World 
War II Home Front National Historic Park was 
established in Richmond, California, Betty be-
came actively involved in preserving the East 
Bay’s rich history. In 2004, Betty became a 
ranger with the National Park Service as-
signed to the Rosie the Riveter Park. In this 
role, Betty educated thousands of park visitors 
by sharing her story as a young Black woman 
working during the war. Betty has worked tire-
lessly to continue honoring the past and to 
teach future generations about the wartime ef-
forts. Her voice has been critical in highlighting 
the experiences of women and African Ameri-
cans who had participated in the war so that 
these stories are not forgotten. At 100 years 
old, Betty was the oldest National Park Rang-
er in the country. 
Betty has been rightfully recognized over 
the years for her advocacy and commitment to 
social justice. Betty was named ‘‘Woman of 
the Year’’ in 1995 by the California State Leg-
islature and was recognized by the National 
Women’s History Project as one of the coun-
try’s ten outstanding women in 2006. She was 
formally recognized by President Obama in 
2015, even having the honor of lighting the 
National Christmas Tree that year. Addition-
ally, she was Glamour Magazine’s ‘‘Woman of 
the Year’’ in 2018 and recently had a middle 
school in El Sobrante named after her. 
Betty is a pillar of our community and I am 
proud to call her a friend. Her leadership and 
passionate spirit are an inspiration to all who 
know her. Please join me in congratulating 
Betty on her retirement and honoring her for 
her years of dedicated service.

BLACK MATERNAL HEALTH WEEK 
2022 
HON. ALMA S. ADAMS 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, information 
can save lives. Even children’s cartoons used 
to say that ‘‘knowing is half the battle.’’ 
So, during the fifth Annual Black Maternal 
Health Week, which runs April 11–17, I want 
to impress upon our community that research 
and data could not be more important to our 
efforts to close the mortality and morbidity 
gaps between white and Black parents. 
When my fellow members of Congress learn 
that Black Americans are three-to-four times 
more likely to die in childbirth than white 
Americans, they pay attention—even if they’re 
not paying attention to concepts like structural 
racism, implicit bias, and social determinants 
of health. 
However, the data also tell us that bias and 
racism are alive and well in healthcare; or as 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who we lost 54 
years ago this week, once said: ‘‘Of all the 
forms of inequality, injustice in Health care is 
the most shocking and inhumane.’’ 
Health care is not equal in our country, and 
it never has been so we shouldn’t be sur-
prised when that inequality extends to mothers 
and their children—and the numbers here 
don’t lie. Unfortunately, we know the truth: ma-
ternal health in America is in crisis, and like so 
many crises, the maternal mortality crisis has 
hit Black America harder. 
As we’ve seen from the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the adage is true: when white America 
comes down with a cold, Black America gets 
pneumonia. In maternal care, Black women 
are three to four times more likely to die from 
preventable pregnancy-related complications 
than non-Hispanic, white women—no matter 
their level of education or socioeconomic sta-
tus—even though 60 percent these deaths are 
preventable. 
What’s worse is for every mother lost there 
are hundreds of near misses. And annually, 
approximately 50,000 women experience se-
vere pregnancy complications which result in 
serious health consequences. 
However, because we have this data, we’ve 
been able to develop policy solutions to ad-
dress the Black maternal health crisis in Amer-
ica. If we get this work done, we will not only 
raise the tide for Black women—who are 
among the most marginalized and the most 
vulnerable—we will also improve outcomes 
and care for all women. 
My work on this issue started when I joined 
up with then-Senator KAMALA HARRIS and the 
Black Mamas Matter Alliance to introduce our 
Annual Black Maternal Health Week resolu-
tion, something we’ve done every year since. 
Then, in 2019, I joined the youngest Black 
woman ever elected to Congress, Congress-
woman LAUREN UNDERWOOD, to launch a Con-
gressional caucus focused on Black maternal 
health. 
As the co-founders and co-chairs of the bi-
partisan Black Maternal Health Caucus, we 
developed a solution: the Momnibus. The 
Momnibus is a package of 12 bills to com-
prehensively address all aspects of the mater-
nal mortality crisis, with a focus on Black par-
ents using reproductive justice as a guide. It is 
a solution that says, unequivocally, Black 
mothers matter. 
With the support of a historic coalition of 
nearly 200 health care providers, Black moth-
ers, policymakers, researchers, activists, and 
maternal health advocates we crafted a col-
laborative, targeted and timely set of policies 
to improve maternal health outcomes for Black 
pregnant and postpartum individuals, particu-
larly during the COVID pandemic. The Black 
Maternal Health Momnibus will fill gaps in ex-
isting legislation to comprehensively address 
every dimension of the Black maternal health 
crisis in America. 
Throughout the process, we remained very 
intentional about centering the voices of Black 
women and ensuring Black woman-led organi-
zations are consulted often. The Momnibus 
makes investments in social determinants of 
health, community-based organizations, the 
growth and diversification of the perinatal 
workforce, improvements in data collection 
and quality measures, digital tools like tele-
health, and innovative payment models. Fi-
nally, in addition to direct efforts to improve 
Black 
maternal 
health 
outcomes, 
the 
Momnibus focuses on high-risk populations, 
including 
women 
veterans, 
incarcerated 
women, and Native Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E379 
April 11, 2022 
When we reintroduced the Momnibus last 
year, we went from nine bills to 12 bills be-
cause we had to have legislation to address 
immunization—vaccines—as well as COVID– 
19. The state of maternal health in this country 
is a crisis, but with the pandemic, we experi-
enced a crisis within a crisis—and tens of 
thousands of pregnant women have had to 
struggle with being pregnant or giving birth 
while experiencing COVID–19. Two of these 
new bills in the Momnibus package promote 
maternal vaccinations to protect the health 
and safety of moms and babies and invest in 
federal programs to address the unique risks 
for and effects of COVID–19 during and after 
pregnancy. 
Last year, we received good news when all 
the eligible provisions of the Momnibus were 
included in the Build Back Better Act, which 
passed the House. The Momnibus provisions 
in Build Back Better invest in addressing so-
cial determinants of health that influence ma-
ternal health outcomes; fund community-based 
organizations working to improve maternal 
health outcomes; grow and diversify the 
perinatal workforce to improve maternity care; 
support moms with mental health conditions 
and substance abuse disorders; invest in His-
torically Black Colleges and Universities to 
train culturally competent health professionals; 
and address the effects of COVID–19 and cli-
mate change on mothers. 
That’s a comprehensive approach to this cri-
sis, something we’ve never tried before. How-
ever, the Build Back Better Act is stalled in the 
Senate and will likely be passed in a more lim-
ited form, if at all. We as Members of Con-
gress must take the Black maternal health cri-
sis seriously. Moms and children are dying, 
and we must act. 
When we think about how important moth-
ers are, we should recognize that parents 
touch so many lives, even outside their imme-
diate families. Their threads weave into count-
less others to form the fabric of our commu-
nities. When we lose a parent to this crisis, we 
lose teachers, volunteers, activists, profes-
sionals, 
caregivers, 
parishioners, 
and 
mommies. When too many threads are pulled, 
the fabric unravels. 
We owe our communities a different future. 
This Black Maternal Health Week, let’s work 
together to pass the Momnibus into law. 
Our mamas cannot wait.

HON. CARLOS A. GIMENEZ

Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
commemorate 
the 
Whispering 
Manes 
Therapeutic Riding Center’s opening of a new 
arena in Florida’s 26th Congressional District. 
It is my honor to recognize individuals and or-
ganizations in my district that dedicate their 
time and resources to helping improve the 
lives of children and their families that struggle 
with physical, cognitive, and emotional disabil-
ities. 
Whispering Manes is opening a new arena 
and dedicating it to Marilyn Fizer March, an 
advocate and leader for children who suffer 
from a wide variety of disabilities. The March 
Arena is in the heart of my district and serves 
a neighborhood that would not otherwise have 
access to equine activities. 
Through safe and supervised programs, 
participants with a wide range of disabilities 
are given the opportunity to participate in ac-
tivities that promote physical, cognitive, or 
emotional well-being. The program aims to 
promote improvements in core and overall 
muscle strength, balance, and motor skills. 
I am always proud to recognize individuals 
and organizations that dedicate their time to 
improving the lives of children in my district 
and in the community. I look forward to seeing 
this new arena provide invaluable services to 
this community and the constituents of Flor-
ida’s 26th Congressional District.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOSEPH 
C. BOSCO 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sorrow that I rise today to honor the life 
of the late Joseph ‘‘Joey’’ Bosco, a lifelong 
Enfield, Connecticut resident who passed on 
April 1st, 2022, at the age of 60. 
Born to Angelo Bosco and Mary Diana 
Bosco in 1962 in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
just across the Connecticut border, Joey was 
destined to be an irreplaceable member of the 
Enfield community. Upon graduating from En-
field High School in 1980, Joey remained in 
Enfield where he became the co-owner of 
Bosco Automotive Inc. Joey was memorable 
for his dedication to his town and family. 
Having lived all his life in Enfield, his love 
for his town was reflected through the many 
hours of dedicated public service to the Town 
of Enfield. Joey served as a member of the 
Enfield Town Council for more than 14 years 
and on several other community boards 
throughout the years. He was especially nota-
ble as a member of the Board of Directors for 
the Four Town Fair. He spent many hours 
planning leading up to the fair, the main event 
of which for him was always meant to be an 
opportunity to connect with family and friends. 
Apart from his constant service to his town, 
Joey spent his free time on the beach, at car 
shows, and on his farm. Friday nights Joey 
was known to be at the Country Diner with his 
family and friends talking for hours. The most 
rewarding title to Joey is being a ‘‘Papa’’ to his 
four loving grandchildren, Charlotte, Waylon 
Joseph, Oliver, and Reagan. 
Madam Speaker, it is an incredible honor to 
represent constituents as loyal to the future of 
their community as Joey Bosco. Though 
Joey’s legacy and character will continue to 
have a ripple effect as a force of altruism, par-
ticularly for those who knew him in the Enfield 
community, his loss and what it means for the 
region cannot be understated. I had the oppor-
tunity to get to know him at community events- 
parades and veteran’s ceremonies. Walking 
beside him, I saw firsthand how revered he 
was by neighbors, customers, first responders 
and fellow public officials. We were different 
parties, but on a personal level he was very 
cordial and down to earth. I really enjoyed 
spending time with him. As difficult as it is for 
us to process his passing, it is worth finding 
solace in the impact that his life will have upon 
the local community as well as his surviving 
family and loved ones, namely his devoted 
wife Jackie, and daughters, Jacquelyn M. 
Siekiera and her husband Zachary, Jessica M. 
Bosco, Jamie Jo Bosco and her spouse, Isaac 
Velazquez, and considered son in law, Ben 
Hebert, and his four cherished grandchildren. 
Joey also leaves behind brothers, John and 
Angelo, and sister, Rori, as well as numerous 
extended family members and friends. 
To that end, I ask that the entire House join 
me in setting Joseph Bosco’s name further 
into stone, and to recognize his life of incred-
ible service to the Enfield community.

OBSERVING DISTRACTED DRIVING 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. KIRSHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join thousands of organizations 
and individuals around the country in observa-
tion of Distracted Driving Awareness Month. 
Over ten years ago, a mother who lost her 
daughter to a distracted driving crash success-
fully petitioned this body to have April officially 
designated as Distracted Driving Awareness 
Month. This month brings a needed aware-
ness of the impact distracted driving has had 
and continues to have on our nation’s road-
ways. 
Research shows that using electronic de-
vices increases cognitive distraction. Yet, ac-
cording to a recent survey released by the Na-
tional Safety Council—a nonprofit based in my 
district—47% of drivers believe they can safely 
text while driving. This can be deadly on the 
road, where a split-second distraction can 
cause a crash. Approximately 3,142 people 
died in distraction-affected driving crashes in 
2020—that’s eight people dying every day 
from a completely preventable cause—and 
this number is widely believed to be under-
counted. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, the roads 
have become much more dangerous. Motor 
vehicle deaths in 2021 are estimated to be the 
highest in 17 years, despite dramatic drops in 
miles driven as Americans stayed home. 
Though there are many factors involved in this 
increase in the number of people dying in 
crashes, distraction certainly played a part. 
I am proud to have led legislation that was 
enacted last year to help end this epidemic, 
though there is more to be done to eradicate 
this issue. I encourage all motorists to commit 
to driving attentively and safely, without the 
distraction of cell phones or other devices. I 
also hope my colleagues will join me this 
month in raising awareness about this impor-
tant issue. Do it for all our constituents. Their 
lives are more valuable than any call, email, or 
text.

HONORING TODD SCHNUCK 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Todd Schnuck, CEO of 
Schnuck Markets in St. Louis, MO, who is 
being awarded the Glen Woodard Award for 
Outstanding Leadership in Public Affairs for 
the food industry by FMI—the Food Industry 
Association. 
I know firsthand what a strong advocate 
Todd is for the food industry. He is in a unique 
position to be a voice for supermarkets— 
spending his career leading the family busi-
ness that was started in 1939, and now oper-
ating over 100 stores in 5 states, employing 
thousands and positively impacting the lives of 
millions of people in our great state of Mis-
souri. 
Todd is a distinguished leader and advocate 
for the industry. Both the company and Todd 
personally are philanthropic leaders in the St. 
Louis area and Todd’s ability to effectively ar-
ticulate public policy issues to federal, state, 
and local elected officials is exceptional. 
Todd and his team have been wonderful 
partners as we have each worked to advance 
our shared goal of making life better for fami-
lies in Missouri. He is a man of strong char-
acter, integrity, and faith, qualities I can attest 
extend to his family as well. I was honored to 
be able to work with his daughter Margaret 
when she interned for my office. 
Todd is not just a leader in his professional 
life, he is also one in our community, and I am 
grateful to call him a friend. I congratulate 
Todd on this well-deserved award and I ap-
plaud FMI—the Food Industry Association for 
selecting a person of Todd’s caliber for this 
important honor.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
101ST 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF TABERNACLE MIS-
SIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, April 11, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I take this 
time to congratulate Tabernacle Missionary 
Baptist Church of East Chicago, Indiana, as 
the congregation joins together in celebration 
of the church’s 101st anniversary. The parish-
ioners, along with Tabernacle’s pastor, Rev-
erend Antonio R. Daggett Sr., will be com-
memorating this momentous occasion with a 
celebratory banquet on Friday, May 13, 2022, 
at Lake Etta Banquet Hall in Gary, Indiana. 
On April 16, 1921, a new church branched 
out from Lily White Baptist Church of Gary. It 
was founded and organized by Reverend 
White at the home of James Nickle of East 
Chicago, Indiana. After prayerful consider-
ation, the name Tabernacle, which means ‘‘a 
sacred tent and dwelling place of God’’ was 
suggested and approved, thus establishing the 
church under Reverend White’s leadership. 
Throughout the years, numerous remarkable 
pastors have helped build the church and ex-
pand the congregation as well as the out-
standing services and programs offered to the 
community. In 1962, Reverend James H. Hun-
ter became pastor of Tabernacle, a position 
he held for an astonishing fifty-six years. A de-
termined and passionate servant, Pastor Hun-
ter accomplished many great things during his 
tenure at Tabernacle, including the relocation 
of the church from 3867 Pennsylvania Avenue 
to its current home at 3715 Butternut Street. 
The building and its furnishings, parsonage, 
and parking facilities were built a cost of more 
than half a million dollars. On April 12, 1981, 
during a joyous service, the church mortgage 
was placed before the altar and burned. 
Over the years under the leadership of Rev-
erend Hunter, Tabernacle has instituted many 
ministries and organizations in its effort to fur-
ther to gospel and promote unity within the 
community. The church continues to be ac-
tively involved in national, regional, state, and 
district affiliates of the Progressive National 
Baptist Convention, as well as local civic 
groups, and is a Life Member of the NAACP. 
On June 13, 2021, Reverend Antonio 
Daggett Sr. was installed as pastor of Taber-
nacle Missionary Baptist Church. During a 
time when many churches and religious orga-
nizations were no longer meeting in person 
due to the pandemic, Pastor Daggett states 
that he, led by almighty God, was compelled 
to continue with in-person worship while main-
taining CDC guidelines and safety measures. 
Under Reverend Daggett’s leadership, Sunday 
School has been reestablished while bible 
study, prayer meeting, youth choir and youth 
ministry, birthday celebrations, nurses’ guild, 
mothers’ board, and many new ventures are 
on the horizon. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring and congratulating Tabernacle Mis-
sionary Baptist Church of East Chicago, Indi-
ana, on its 101st anniversary. The members 
and church leaders have dedicated them-
selves to serving others, especially those most 
in need, and they are an inspiration to all.
