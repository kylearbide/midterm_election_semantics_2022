Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MARCH 10, 2020 
No. 46 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair wishes to 
make an announcement to the House 
regarding floor practices. 
Members are reminded of the unique 
tradition and dignity of the House that 
sets it apart from other institutions 
and workplaces. 
Members should refrain from traf-
ficking in the well when another Mem-
ber, including the presiding officer, is 
addressing the House. 
The rules establish 15 minutes as the 
minimum time for electronic voting in 
the ordinary case and 5 and 2 minutes 
as the minimum time in other cases 
when Members are already in or near 
the Chamber in response to an earlier 
vote. 
As a reminder, Members should at-
tempt to come to the floor within the 
15-minute period as prescribed by the 
first ringing of the bells. As a point of 
courtesy to each of your colleagues, 
voting within the allotted time would 
help with the maintenance of this in-
stitution. 
Members are further reminded that 
the policy is to not terminate the vote 
when a Member is in the well attempt-
ing to cast a vote. Other efforts to hold 
the vote open are not similarly pro-
tected. 
Members should wear appropriate 
business attire during all sittings of 
the House, however brief their appear-
ance on the floor may be. 
f 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
order of the House of January 7, 2020, 
the Chair will now recognize Members 
from lists submitted by the majority 
and minority leaders for morning-hour 
debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
PROTECTING YOURSELF FROM 
CORONAVIRUS 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, as 
the number of coronavirus cases rises, 
it is important that our constituents 
have the information they need to pro-
tect themselves, so I am going to use 
my 5 minutes today to walk through 
what doctors and health experts know 
and what Congress has done in re-
sponse. 
First, there is no vaccine to prevent 
coronavirus, so taking steps to protect 
yourself is paramount. 
As much as possible, avoid contact 
with individuals who are already sick. 
If you yourself are sick, stay home. 
There is no need to go to work and risk 
getting other people sick as well. 
Try to avoid touching your face, es-
pecially your eyes, nose, and mouth. 
If you have to cough or sneeze, cover 
your mouth with a tissue. If you don’t 
have a tissue, use your sleeve. 
Be sure that you are cleaning and 
disinfecting frequently touched objects 
and 
surfaces, 
like 
doorknobs 
and 
phones. 
If you feel compelled to wear a face 
mask, be sure that you check the 
CDC’s recommendations. Face masks 
are not recommended for people who 
are trying to protect themselves from 
respiratory 
diseases. 
This 
includes 
coronavirus. However, face masks are 
recommended if you are showing symp-
toms of coronavirus or another res-
piratory disease. 
Most importantly, the CDC rec-
ommends that you wash your hands 
frequently. Do so with soap and water 
for at least 20 seconds. You should es-
pecially wash your hands after using 
the restroom; before you eat; and after 
you blow your nose, cough, or sneeze. 
If you are unable to wash your hands 
but have a sanitizer available, the CDC 
recommends that it be alcohol-based 
with at least 60 percent alcohol. 
As the coverage of this ongoing out-
break continues and the number of 
positive cases grows, it is also impor-
tant that the American people know 
what the symptoms of coronavirus ac-
tually are. 
According to the CDC, coronavirus 
symptoms may appear as soon as 2 
days and as late as 14 days after expo-
sure. These symptoms include fever, 
cough, and shortness of breath. 
If you are suffering from these symp-
toms, you should stay home. Do not 
rush to the emergency room, a minute 
clinic, or another medical facility. 
While you are at home, do your best 
to stay away from your family or other 
people you may regularly encounter. 
The next step is to call your doctors 
and let them know that you are exhib-
iting symptoms of coronavirus. They 
will tell you the next steps you should 
take. 
If they want you to come in for a 
test, 
this 
call 
will 
allow 
your 
healthcare provider to take the nec-
essary steps to keep other people from 
getting infected. 
If you are going to the doctor or out 
in public with symptoms, now is the 
time to wear a face mask. 
If your symptoms continue to wors-
en, call your doctor and seek prompt 
medical attention. 
Be sure that your doctor is in contact 
with your local or State health depart-
ment. This will make the monitoring 
or self-monitoring process easier for 
both you and health officials. 
If you are instructed to self-quar-
antine, stay at home until you are in-
structed to leave. This will minimize

the risk of transmitting the disease to 
others. 
Finally, we have an obligation to 
each other to do everything we can to 
prevent the further spread of this dis-
ease. 
Again, if you do not feel well or you 
have any of these symptoms, do not go 
to work. This includes my colleagues 
and my staff here in the Capitol, some 
of whom have already made the respon-
sible decision to self-quarantine them-
selves. 
We have had briefings from adminis-
tration officials leading the national 
effort to get this outbreak under con-
trol. We know how serious this is. Now 
is the time to lead by example. 
That is why, last week, Congress ap-
proved a massive $8.3 billion emer-
gency appropriations package to ad-
dress the scale and seriousness of the 
coronavirus epidemic. I was especially 
glad to see that this package included 
several key provisions that meet needs 
specific to my home State of Rhode Is-
land, where we have three confirmed 
cases already. 
This includes nearly $1 billion for 
drugs, masks, lab tests, and additional 
resources that will be provided to State 
and local health agencies; $7 billion in 
low-interest loans to affected small 
businesses, to help cushion the eco-
nomic blow of this public health emer-
gency; $3 billion for research and devel-
opment of treatments and vaccines; 
and $300 million to ensure those vac-
cines are affordable. 
Most importantly, this bill gives doc-
tors and public health experts the re-
sources they need to do their jobs. 
We have the best doctors, scientists, 
and researchers in the world. Now is 
the time to let them do what they do 
best without feeling pressure from poli-
ticians, including the President. 
I am pleased also that the Speaker 
yesterday sent a Dear Colleague letter 
which identifies some of the issues that 
remain of importance to us that we are 
going to focus on in sort of the second 
effort by the Congress: paid sick leave, 
enhanced 
unemployment 
insurance, 
food security, clear protections for 
frontline workers, widespread testing 
for the coronavirus, as well as afford-
able treatments for all, anti-price- 
gouging protections, and increasing the 
capacity of our medical system. 
I really want to thank the Speaker 
for identifying those issues which re-
main unaddressed and which the Con-
gress must address in a full and com-
prehensive response to this public 
health crisis. 
f 
FORGING NEW HOPE FOR 
ALZHEIMER’S PATIENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
EMMER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the hard work of the 
Alzheimer’s Association. 
This month, over 1,000 men and 
women will come together in Wash-
ington for the annual Alzheimer’s Im-
pact 
Movement 
Advocacy 
Forum. 
These advocates, like so many of us, 
have faced the pain of Alzheimer’s, ei-
ther through a friend, a loved one, or 
their own experience. By sharing their 
stories, we can raise awareness and, 
hopefully, implement policies that im-
prove the lives of those suffering from 
this disease. 
One of these policies, Mr. Speaker, is 
the Improving HOPE for Alzheimer’s 
Act. I encourage my colleagues to join 
me as a cosponsor of the bill, which 
will provide Medicare outreach and re-
porting on Alzheimer’s care. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the Alz-
heimer’s Association and the many ad-
vocates who will be in Washington this 
month for sharing their stories, espe-
cially Kanada Yazbek, a constituent of 
Minnesota’s Sixth Congressional Dis-
trict. 
Not only does she have family mem-
bers who have been diagnosed with the 
disease, Kanada has Alzheimer’s. Ev-
erywhere and anywhere people will lis-
ten, Kanada spreads the word about 
Alzheimer’s and its impact on families 
and the urgent need to find a cure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join us in standing up to stop this dev-
astating disease. 
TEACHING FINANCIAL LITERACY FOR LIFE 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the McKinley Area 
Learning Center in Waite Park, Min-
nesota, for their participation in the 
Securities Industry and Financial Mar-
kets Association’s annual Capitol Hill 
Challenge. 
This challenge, which matches teach-
ers and students with Members of Con-
gress, gives teams of three to five mid-
dle or high school students a hypo-
thetical $100,000 portfolio of stocks, 
mutual funds, bonds, and liquid assets. 
The 10 teams with the best performing 
portfolios win a trip to Washington. 
The challenge highlights essential fi-
nancial literacy, like investing. The 
students also work together to manage 
this portfolio and, in the process, learn 
the value of teamwork. 
Good luck to the McKinley Area 
Learning Center students participating 
in the Capitol Hill Challenge. We look 
forward to hearing more about your 
progress, and good luck in the competi-
tion. 
RECOGNIZING NEXT GENERATION OF 
ASTRONOMERS 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Minnesota’s Na-
tional Space Grant College and Fellow-
ship Program. 
The Minnesota program distributes 
funds to sponsor student fellowships 
and scholarships related to space re-
search, education, and public service. 
These grants can accelerate the diver-
sity of the STEM field for future gen-
erations by supporting women and 
other students from underrepresented 
groups. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly 
highlight the work of St. Cloud State 
University, which is working with the 
Leech Lake Tribal College to develop 
Native American knowledge of astron-
omy and model rocketry in the com-
munity and workshops for teachers 
across our State. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the universities 
and colleges across Minnesota that are 
contributing to the program, and I 
thank all the students whose work 
today will advance our future in space. 
CONGRATULATING MARY DEGIOVANNI, CHAMPION 
FOR SARTELL 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mary Degiovanni, 
who announced in January that she is 
retiring in July after 16 years of work-
ing for the city of Sartell. 
After serving as city administrator 
in Annandale, Mary joined the city of 
Sartell as finance director in 2004. 
Since 2013, she has served as a strong 
and capable city administrator. 
In her tenure, Mary has overseen 
rapid growth in Sartell, with projects 
from updating facilities at Watab Park 
and Lake Francis Park, to building a 
new community center and public safe-
ty facility. 
As a community leader, Mary has 
helped build a Sartell that is ready to 
welcome new generations of citizens. 
Rapid expansions in the area, including 
into 
industries 
like 
medical 
tech-
nology, presented challenges that Mary 
overcame. 
Congratulations on your retirement, 
Mary. We are grateful for your service. 
b 1015 
CONGRATULATING THE CHAMPION ANDOVER 
GIRLS HOCKEY TEAM 
Mr. EMMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to applaud the Andover High 
School Huskies women’s hockey team, 
who won the class AA State champion-
ship just a couple of weeks ago. The 
Huskies’ win is the first Minnesota 
State high school league championship 
in the history of Andover. 
In the championship game at the 
Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, An-
dover upset the highly favored Edina 
High School Hornets by a score of 5–3. 
The Huskies’ championship is all the 
more sweet considering the favored 
Hornets had won three straight State 
championships. 
Congratulations to Coach Melissa 
Volk and the Huskies on making his-
tory for Andover.

CORONAVIRUS PREPAREDNESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. BERA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as a doctor and a public health expert, 
someone who has spent his time in 
Congress thinking about global health 
security and pandemic preparedness. I 
rise 
today 
because 
the 
novel 
coronavirus is on everyone’s mind. We 
have to talk about it, and we have to 
think about how we got here, what we 
know, and where we are going. 
First, let’s think about how we got 
here. If you think about it, in late 2019,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1561 
March 10, 2020 
we heard the first reports that there 
was a novel virus occurring in China. 
In early January, we saw China take 
unprecedented steps to enact contain-
ment, locking down Wuhan and large 
portions of their country. 
We had our first briefing about 7 or 8 
weeks ago. At that briefing, I identified 
four areas that the administration 
really had to focus on: 
Number one, you need a command 
control structure. You have to identify 
one person who is not political and not 
partisan but is a public health expert 
who has that ability to work across the 
interagency process. 
Number two, you had to do an emer-
gency supplemental and get resources 
out to the hospitals, the public health 
experts, et cetera, to make sure those 
who were on the front line had what 
they needed. 
Number three, we had to get our sci-
entists and experts—we have the best 
in the world at the CDC and NIH—to 
the epicenter, to the hot zone in China. 
That was delayed not because we didn’t 
want to get there, but the Chinese 
would not allow us direct access. 
Number four, we had to be trans-
parent with the public. We had to let 
people know the facts as they were oc-
curring. 
Fast-forward, 6 weeks ago, I held the 
first hearing in my Subcommittee on 
Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation 
on what was going on. We focused on 
the first step: containment. It was evi-
dent at that hearing with the public 
experts that we had that you really 
couldn’t contain this novel coronavirus 
now known as COVID–19. We knew, 
based 
on 
the 
public 
health 
rec-
ommendations, that we would likely be 
seeing community events and commu-
nity spreading; that was pretty evi-
dent. 
We lost time. The fact that China 
tried to contain things gave us a little 
bit of time, but the fact that we didn’t 
develop a test and we didn’t put things 
in place really set us behind the eight 
ball. 
Two weeks ago, we had the first com-
munity case in my home county, Sac-
ramento County. That patient was 
transferred to UC-Davis, which is my 
home facility. Based on that, we 
changed the testing criteria. We still 
don’t have enough tests out there, but 
we changed the criteria to allow the 
health professionals, if they suspect a 
case of coronavirus, to be able to order 
that test. Now we have got a problem 
though. We don’t have the tests that 
are available. 
We now are moving into the second 
phase of coronavirus, which is mitiga-
tion. In order to do that, Congress took 
the first important step last week with 
the $8.3 billion emergency supple-
mental. We have to get the resources, 
the protective gear, the masks, and the 
tests out to the community who is on 
the front line. 
The reason why I am saying that is, 
yesterday, we had the first community 
case in my home city of Elk Grove, in 
the school district. We had a grammar 
school child who tested positive. Both 
his parents have also tested positive. 
Elk Grove Unified School District be-
came the first school district in north-
ern California to shut down for a week. 
I don’t know if that is the right move 
or the wrong move, but I understand, 
having spoken to the superintendent, 
the security and health of the children 
are paramount. 
Now we have to make sure that our 
folks on the front line and the folks 
who are having to make some of these 
decisions have the best advice possible. 
That is why we have got to make sure 
the CDC puts out guidelines and up-
dates those guidelines on a regular 
basis. 
We have great personnel at the CDC: 
Director Redfield, Dr. Messonnier, and 
others. We have got to let them do 
their work. Even if it is not what the 
administration wants to hear and even 
if it is bad news, it is important for us 
to put out transparent information and 
guidance to the public. 
Now, I also got on the phone and 
talked to my hospital directors and 
others. What is concerning to me is 
they are starting to get those calls, et 
cetera. They still don’t have the test-
ing capabilities that they need. That is 
of paramount urgency right now. 
I applaud Vice President PENCE for 
allowing the commercial sector to step 
in here and start developing those 
tests. Let’s remove those bureaucratic 
barriers and give our private sector, 
public 
health 
labs, 
and 
academic 
health centers the support that they 
need to get testing capabilities up and 
running. 
Now, I think about this as a doctor. 
It is important for us at the local level 
to have good command control struc-
tures in place and good lines of commu-
nication. Let’s let the doctors and the 
scientists do their jobs. Our job as Con-
gress is to support those on the front 
line and make sure they have the re-
sources that they need, and we will get 
through this. 
f 
PRECIOUS LITTLE SON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exemplary cit-
izen, Ms. Crystal Skidmore of West 
Virginia. 
Between 2000 and 2001, around 127,000 
children were adopted in the United 
States, one of whom was Crystal’s son 
whom she gave up for a better life. 
That same year, only 44 percent of the 
3.1 
million 
unintended 
pregnancies 
ended in birth. 
Instead of giving up hope and having 
an abortion, Crystal looked to Jesus 
and chose life for her child. To this 
day, she protects her son’s name when 
she shares her story. But by the grace 
of God, she still has a close relation-
ship with him and his adoptive family. 
Isaiah 40:31 reads: ‘‘. . . but those 
who hope in the Lord will renew their 
strength. They will soar on wings like 
eagles; they will run and not grow 
weary; they will walk and not grow 
faint.’’ 
She has described the miracle of her 
son in a poem she wrote, titled, ‘‘Pre-
cious Little Son.’’ It goes like this: 
Today’s the day that you were made 
A new life has been begun 
Within the womb inside of me 
My precious little son. 
From this first day you changed me 
Now through your eyes I see 
Do I want your eyes to look at 
The same things that I see? 
I look around at this world of mine 
In a way I have never done 
I think . . . Is it safe here 
For my precious little son? 
Sadly I know 
The answer is no 
So I drop down to my knees 
I cry as I ask Jesus 
Please help you and me. 
Where are the smiling faces 
For your new eyes to see? 
They are not here in my world 
If I die, they may never be. 
I can only protect you for a while 
While you are safe inside of me 
So I search for smiling happy faces 
For your brand-new eyes to see. 
Again I ask Jesus 
To help me find someone 
To love this life inside of me 
My precious little son. 
I know someone is waiting. 
God has chosen them 
To give you all the love you need 
And make you part of them. 
How I know you need them 
How they have prayed for you to come 
So they can share a part of their world with 
Their precious little son. 
I found the happy smiling faces 
That I want you to see 
And they can’t wait to meet their son 
Who lives inside of me. 
Their world is so much brighter 
So I share my love for you 
With lots of happy smiling faces 
And they will let me love you too. 
I will always love you 
I want you to know 
You are in my heart forever 
You are everywhere I go. 
Now we wait on your arrival 
We can’t wait for you to see 
How good it feels to share a love 
That only through God can be. 
Our happy smiling faces 
Stand together now as one 
To love this life inside of me 
Our precious little son. 
May God be with you.

Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the all-women team 
of scientists from the Novavax Vaccine 
Lab in Gaithersburg, Maryland, who

vaccine since January 10. While they 
still need to be tested, the team has al-
ready developed three potential vac-
cines. 
Women’s History Month is the per-
fect time to highlight how women have 
contributed in our past and continue to 
contribute to the world now and into 
the future. Today we recognize this 
group of scientists and emphasize the 
importance of having women across all 
industries 
and 
leadership 
positions 
around the world. 
50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DELTA SIGMA THETA 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the Montgomery 
County Alumnae Chapter of Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority for all of the 
work they have done for the commu-
nity over their rich, 50-year history. 
The Montgomery County Chapter 
was founded in March of 1970 by 28 
women under past National President 
Lillian P. Benbow. The organization 
was founded to help promote the qual-
ity of life for both African Americans 
and the community at large in Mont-
gomery County. 
I, myself, am lucky enough to have a 
member of the Delta Sigma Theta So-
rority in my office serving the people 
of Maryland’s Sixth District. 
Today, as a part of Women’s History 
Month, we recognize the Montgomery 
County Alumnae Chapter of Delta 
Sigma Theta Sorority for their 50 years 
of service and the positive impact they 
have had on the Montgomery County 
community. 
RECOGNIZING ED HARGIS, RETIRING FREDERICK 
CITY POLICE CHIEF 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the work of Fred-
erick Police Chief Ed Hargis, who just 
recently retired after 41⁄2 years of serv-
ice as the top law enforcement officer 
in Frederick, Maryland. 
Chief Hargis arrived in Frederick in 
2015 with over 33 years of law enforce-
ment experience from around the coun-
try. During his tenure as police chief, 
he worked with city leaders and citi-
zens to ensure Frederick was a safe, 
welcoming community for everyone. 
Chief 
Hargis 
showed 
tremendous 
leadership in Frederick, and we would 
like to commend him for his 37 years of 
public service to our communities. 
HONORING RUBY RUBENS, EDUCATION AND HOUS-
ING ADVOCATE IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY WHO 
RECENTLY PASSED AWAY 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Ruby Rubens, 
a champion for human rights and edu-
cation in Montgomery County, who 
passed away at the end of February at 
the age of 86. 
Ruby Rubens was a force in her com-
munity. She was a founding member of 
the Montgomery County Coalition for 
Equitable Representation in Govern-
ment and worked extensively on hous-
ing rights with the Montgomery Coun-
ty Housing Opportunities Commission, 
the U.S. Civil Service Commission, and 
the Social Security Administration. 
She was greatly involved in the edu-
cation community as a longtime volun-
teer in Montgomery County Public 
Schools. People were inspired to follow 
in her footsteps, including her son, Joe 
Rubens, who is the principal of John F. 
Kennedy High School. 
For her work, she was a recipient of 
the Neal Potter Path of Achievement 
Award and was inducted into the Mont-
gomery County Human Rights Hall of 
Fame. 
Ruby was known throughout her 
community for being a constant advo-
cate for those without a voice. Today, 
I would like to honor her life and con-
tributions on the floor of the House of 
Representatives.

INDIVIDUALS 
FOR 
HELPING ATTAIN JUSTICE FOR 
THE CHAMORRO PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Guam (Mr. SAN NICOLAS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to recognize a group that often-
times doesn’t get recognized. I rise to 
recognize this Congress of the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize 
Speaker PELOSI, Leader HOYER, Com-
mittee on Natural Resources Chairman 
GRIJALVA, Minority Leader MCCARTHY, 
Committee 
on 
Natural 
Resources 
Ranking Member, ROB BISHOP. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Sen-
ate Majority Leader MCCONNELL, and 
Committee on the Judiciary Chairman 
GRAHAM, 
Senate 
Minority 
Leader 
SCHUMER, and Committee on the Judi-
ciary Ranking Member FEINSTEIN. 
I rise to recognize the staff of this 
House: Trent Bauserman, Shuwanza 
Goff, 
and 
Ray 
Salazar 
of 
Leader 
HOYER’s office; David Watkins and 
Sarah Lim, leading Chairman GRI-
JALVA’s staff on the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources; Elliot Waldman of the 
Senate Judiciary; Sara Zdeb of Senate 
Committee on the Judiciary Ranking 
Member FEINSTEIN’s office. 
Mr. Speaker, I also rise to recognize 
staff 
of 
the 
administration: 
Rob 
Howarth of the Department of the Inte-
rior; Michael DiRoma of the U.S. 
Treasury; and Doug Hoelscher of the 
White House. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize these 
individuals because without them, we 
would not have been able to move for-
ward as expeditiously as we have over 
the past 13 months with H.R. 1365, 
which was addressed by this House yes-
terday. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1365 brings closure 
to a long saga of suffering from the 
people of Guam at the hands of Impe-
rial Japan during World War II, that fi-
nally sees closure with the recognition 
and compensation—as much as we can 
try and call it that—for the sufferings 
of the Chamorro people during the war. 
Oftentimes, Mr. Speaker, it gets 
very, very difficult for us, especially as 
territories, to be able to find closure on 
longstanding issues because of the fact 
that territories are underrepresented 
in this body by the very nature of their 
existence in this country. And yet, de-
spite that, we are able to finally bring 
this issue to closure by the individuals 
I mentioned. 
Mr. Speaker, I put their names in the 
RECORD
today, because I want the 
Chamorro people to be able to look 
back and identify generations from 
now the individuals who made such jus-
tice possible in this House. 
Mr. Speaker, I further rise to address 
another injustice, one that has been 
longstanding in territories, and one 
that also addresses a community that, 
really, in this country should never be 
ignored. 
Mr. Speaker, supplemental security 
income is something that is afforded to 
U.S. citizens throughout this country, 
but once you move to a U.S. territory, 
you immediately become ineligible for 
supplemental security income. 
Mr. Speaker, as we are aware, that is 
something that is provided to the most 
vulnerable in our community—those 
with disabilities, those who are at cer-
tain ages that require that kind of sup-
port. Mr. Speaker, for us to be neglect-
ing our very own citizens in our terri-
tories just because of where they live, 
I think is something that this body 
very much needs to address. 
Unfortunately, we run into fiscal 
constraints and the price tag of having 
to move forward something of such 
magnitude. 
And 
while 
we 
really 
shouldn’t put dollars and cents to the 
quality of life of those most vulnerable 
in this country, we still face those fis-
cal realities as territories, and the fis-
cal realities that this Congress must 
grapple with if they were to extend 
supplemental security income to the 
territories. 
Mr. Speaker, we introduced H.R. 208 
in the 116th Congress. That was in-
tended to address the fiscal constraints 
in a manner that all territories are 
willing to come to the table and work 
together on. And rather than having 
all territories at once try and pursue 
supplemental security income for their 
residents, we have decided to try and 
snowball this and handle it one terri-
tory at a time. And Guam has taken 
the lead with H.R. 208, allowing for 
supplemental security income in Guam 
that we may, for just 170,000 people, ex-
tend a critical quality of life service 
that this country has made available 
everywhere else in the United States. 
After we are able to secure this for 
Guam, perhaps we can move this to an-
other small territory, and to another 
small territory, and incrementally ad-
dress this in our budget, that really on 
the greater picture of the cost of sup-
plemental security income, would be a 
fractional rounding error for justice for 
those who so desperately need it in 
areas that are so highly affected. 
Mr. Speaker, Guam, as you are 
aware, is thousands of miles away in 
the middle of the Pacific Ocean. We are 
closer to every Asian city than we are 
to Hawaii. It is very, very difficult for

people with disabilities to be able to 
avail themselves of service providers 
because they can’t just drive to the 
next county or drive to the next State. 
And the thought of flying to Hawaii to 
be able to get those services is so exor-
bitant that it is actually cheaper to go 
from Japan to Dulles International 
Airport than it is to go from Guam to 
Hawaii. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time for us to take 
the next step and pursue further jus-
tice for our territories. 
I wanted to recognize those individ-
uals who made it possible for us to fi-
nally close a chapter on war claims. 
May we now move on to the chapter of 
addressing those people who have dis-
abilities in our country that we really 
should be taking care of that just so 
happen to be living in the U.S. terri-
tories.

PRAYER 
Reverend Erin Keys, Capitol Hill 
Presbyterian 
Church, 
Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer: 
Loving and gracious God, we ask 
Your blessing upon all those gathered 
here today and upon our Nation, God, 
as we, along with countries all over the 
world, face the anxiety and fear cur-
rently surrounding the coronavirus. 
Though much about how this situa-
tion will continue to unfold is un-
known to us, God, we trust that it is 
known to You. From the beginning of 
time, Your spirit has hovered over the 
chaos of our world, bringing order and 
life, and so we pray that Your spirit 
will continue to do so now. 
We pray for the safety of all people, 
and we pray for wisdom for our leaders 
as they guide us through this time. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY)

Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. QUIGLEY led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. QUIGLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, the CDC 
has given the American public some 
simple 
suggestions 
for 
protecting 
themselves and their communities dur-
ing the coronavirus outbreak: Wash 
your hands, cover your cough, and stay 
home if you feel sick. 
But for millions of hardworking 
Americans, staying home from work 
when they are ill is literally not a lux-
ury they can afford. The difference be-
tween staying home for 2 weeks to self- 
isolate and going to work for 2 weeks 
no matter how you feel is the dif-
ference between putting food on your 
table and watching your children go 
hungry. It is the difference between 
buying 
lifesaving 
medications 
and 
going without. 
Here in Congress, Members are fortu-
nate enough to be able to write their 
own doctor’s notes. They can stay 
home and still collect their paychecks. 
Shouldn’t all Americans have that 
same option? 
f 
HONORING THE HEROISM OF LIEU-
TENANT ERIC VARNER AND DE-
TECTIVE EUGENE WATLINGTON 
(Mr. CRAWFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the heroism of two po-
lice officers in Forrest City, Arkansas, 
Lieutenant Eric Varner and Detective 
Eugene Watlington, who stopped a po-
tential mass shooting in progress on 
February 10. 
On that fateful morning, a gunman 
entered a Wal-Mart in Forrest City and 
began threatening customers. Officers 
Varner and Watlington responded with-
in minutes, despite not wearing body 
armor, as plainclothes officers. When 
they confronted the suspect and tried 
to peacefully deescalate the situation, 
the gunman opened fire. Both officers 
were struck, but they were able to re-
turn fire and kill the shooter. 
Both officers were seriously injured, 
and I ask that my colleagues join me in 
praying for a speedy and full recovery. 
Lieutenant 
Varner 
and 
Detective 
Watlington saved many lives that day 
without regard for their own safety, 
and I invite Congress to join me in hon-
oring them. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the coronavirus is a public 
health crisis in need of a strong, clear, 
and consistent response from Wash-
ington. The only way to stop the eco-
nomic damage is to stop the spread of 
the virus and to keep people from get-
ting sick and dying. 
Paid sick leave should be extended to 
32 million Americans who currently do 
not have it. A onetime Federal tax 
credit could offset the cost of universal 
paid leave to help stop the spread of 
the virus. Public health costs for test-
ing and treatment at the local and 
State level should be assumed by the 
Federal Government for spending on 
the crisis response. 
Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer 
Institute and Erie County Health De-
partment in my community are doing 
that today at enormous expense and 
dwindling resources. 
Every dollar spent on public health 
provides an economic boost. The time 
to stimulate the economy is after the 
virus has been controlled. Once that 
occurs, we need to go big on infrastruc-
ture to inject both growth and con-
fidence 
in 
the 
American 
economy 
again.

COMMEMORATING 100TH BIRTHDAY 
OF JOHN BARFIELD OF LOUISIANA 
(Mr. ABRAHAM asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 100th birth-
day of Mr. John Barfield from my home 
State of Louisiana. 
Mr. Barfield served in World War II 
under George S. Patton as part of the

sion. He was deployed to many dif-
ferent posts throughout Europe and

bravery and his sacrifice. 
Please join me in wishing a happy

John Barfield, whose courage and dedi-
cation to this country are second to 
none.

MATERNAL HEALTH CRISIS 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, this past 
Sunday, we celebrated International 
Women’s 
Day, 
the 
unique 
stories 
women share, and their power to shape 
our world. 
Like many women in America, my 
story includes a struggle to get preg-
nant. My son, Jordan, was a miracle 
for me and my family. But for too 
many mothers in America, the miracle 
of pregnancy ends in tragedy. 
The United States has the worst rate 
of maternal death in the developed 
world. This is unacceptable. There is 
no reason that, in the richest Nation 
on Earth, we cannot keep our mothers 
and our families healthy and whole. 
My bill, the Social Determinants for 
Moms Act, will invest in our mothers 
and fund the access to services and 
critical research that we need to help 
save the lives of our American women. 
We can solve this crisis together if 
we work together, Republicans and 
Democrats, fighting for a safer, more 
compassionate, and more community- 
focused future. 
f 
COVERING KATY NEWS 
(Mr. OLSON asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, the First 
Amendment to our Constitution says 
that Congress shall make no law 
abridging the freedom of the press. The 
strength of our First Amendment is 
our 
local 
independent 
newspapers. 
These papers fan the flame of Amer-
ican rebellion. There is no America 
without a free local press. 
Last week, we lost a local press news-
paper in Katy, Texas, Covering Katy 
News. They ceased operations. The 
owner and founder, Dennis Spellman, 
left radio 8 years ago to get in the field 
and report on stories that matter to 
people back home. Covering Katy News 
was 21st century news, online pri-
marily. 
Dennis’ family put their heart and 
soul into this paper, Covering Katy 
News. He would stay awake from 4 a.m. 
to 6 p.m.—without a day off in 5 years. 
Dennis’ last article was entitled, 
‘‘Time to Say Good-Bye.’’ My dear 
friend, that is the wrong headline. The 
headline should be, ‘‘Time to Say Good 
Luck.’’ 
NATIONAL DISTINGUISHED 
PRINCIPAL, KRIS VANCAS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Kris Vancas, principal at Benner Ele-
mentary School in Bellefonte, Pennsyl-
vania. 
Kris was recently named Pennsyl-
vania 2019 National Distinguished Prin-
cipal by the National Association of El-
ementary School Principals for his 
‘‘collaborative leadership style, em-
powering his staff to create an environ-
ment where students can excel, and for 
his dedication to students, staff, and 
community.’’ 
Leaders like Kris are important to 
the success and well-being of our Na-
tion’s schools. Kris, however, gives all 
of the credit to his staff, the students, 
and their parents. 
Kris has served as principal at 
Benner Elementary for approximately 
7 years and is well aware of the impact 
teachers and administrators have on 
the daily lives of our Nation’s young 
people. He said: ‘‘You don’t know the 
kind of day they’re having when they 
walk in, but you know you can posi-
tively affect them for the next 6 hours 
they’re here.’’ 
I would like to thank Kris for his 
commitment to students in Pennsylva-
nia’s 15th Congressional District, and I 
congratulate him on this achievement.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF TIP-
PECANOE 
COUNTY 
COUNCIL 
PRESIDENT BRYAN METZGER 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today I rise 
to honor the memory of Tippecanoe 
County 
Council 
President 
Bryan 
Metzger. Originally from Milltown, In-
diana, Bryan lived a life full of love 
and service to his community. 
Bryan first gained an appreciation 
for public service when he joined 4–H at 
just 10 years of age. Always an ener-
getic member, Bryan knew he wanted 
to continue his work with 4–H. After 
graduating from Purdue University, 
Bryan accomplished just that, serving 
for decades with the 4–H Extension 
Services in White and Lawrence Coun-
ties, before settling in Tippecanoe 
County. 
His selflessness extended to other 
youth organizations in his community, 
having worked with the Court Ap-
pointed Special Advocate Association, 
the Cary Home for Children in Tippe-
canoe County, and countless other ad-
vocacy organizations. My friend and 
former 
colleague 
cared 
immensely 
about the growth and development of 
our young people, and any number of 
lives are better for his time and gen-
erous spirit. 
Bryan was also a devoted member of 
the Greater Lafayette Rotary Club, 
and he continued to work for his com-
munity through the Tippecanoe Coun-
ty Council following his retirement 
from the Extension Service in 2012 
after 33 years of faithful service. Inex-
haustible as ever, Bryan most recently 
served as president of the county coun-
cil. 
Those who were fortunate enough to 
have known and worked with Bryan ad-
mired and respected his endless civic 
engagement. Described by his peers as 
dedicated and focused, Bryan embodied 
the 4–H pledge of head, heart, hands, 
and health in service to others, and he 
will be missed dearly by his commu-
nity. 
Thank you for your service, Bryan.

ment Accountability Office of the so-

tory exemptions and immunities to preserve 
and sustain a system for Minor League Base-
ball and its relationship with Major League

SEC. 2. GAO EVALUATION. 
Following consultation with the relevant 
committees of Congress, the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall evaluate 
the social, economic, and historic contribu-
tions that Minor League Baseball has made 
to American life and culture. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) 
and the gentlewoman from West Vir-
ginia (Mrs. MILLER) each will control 20 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members may have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 6020. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. Minor League 
Baseball has been part of the social 
fabric of America for over 100 years. 
Today, there are 160 minor league 
teams across the country, including 
the Staten Island Yankees and the 2019 
New 
York-Penn 
League 
Champion 
Brooklyn Cyclones. 
This bill requires the Government 
Accountability Office to conduct a 
study on the social, economic, and his-
torical contributions that these teams 
have made to American society. Minor 
League 
Baseball 
provides 
family- 
friendly entertainment to millions of 
Americans. It is also an important eco-
nomic influence in many communities, 
employing thousands of individuals, 
and often serves as an important 
source of charitable giving. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
LORI TRAHAN and DAVID MCKINLEY for 
their leadership on this bipartisan ef-
fort. I also recognize the members of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form who have cosponsored this meas-
ure, Representatives COMER, HAALAND, 
KELLER, MILLER, and WELCH. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6020, a bill requiring a Government Ac-
countability Office evaluation of the 
social, economic, and historic con-
tributions that Minor League Baseball 
has made to American life and culture. 
This past year, Major League Base-
ball proposed eliminating at least 40 
minor league teams. MLB says their 
goal is to modernize the minor league 
system, but communities say the plan 
is misguided. Minor league teams are 
often found in smaller cities. I have 
two in my own district, and I visited 
with these teams. 
I know they have a vested interest in 
our communities, and they have a posi-
tive economic impact and contribute 
to our diversification. I have spoken 
with the fans, and they tell me how the 
teams provide a sense of community, 
pride, and togetherness, and improve 
livability in the region. 
Mr. Speaker, there are many other 
benefits that minor league teams pro-
vide. For example, the average cost of 
a major league ticket is over $30, com-
pared to the under $10 for the minor’s, 
and that cost rises exponentially when 
you factor in parking, concessions, and 
souvenirs. 
Minor League Baseball also offers an 
affordable alternative to those families 
that wish to teach their kids about 
America’s pastime. 
In addition to these individual bene-
fits, Minor League Baseball teams do-
nated over $40 million to local char-
ities in 2018 alone. The minor leagues 
have also established initiatives pro-
viding opportunities to athletes around 
the world. These initiatives grow the 
game of baseball. Some of these initia-
tives include providing training and 
equipment to Latin-American players 
and expanding the sport by encour-
aging young girls to play. 
Minor League Baseball also creates 
programs and hosts summer camps for 
kids in their local communities. These 
programs and camps promote a healthy 
lifestyle and teach teamwork and lead-
ership. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I sup-
port this bill, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Massachusetts 
(Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from New York, Chairwoman 
MALONEY, for her leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill would direct 
the GAO to evaluate the social, eco-
nomic, and historic contributions that 
Minor League Baseball has made to 
American life and culture. 
George Will wrote last October: ‘‘In 
baseball, as in the remainder of life, 
the most valuable rules are unwrit-
ten.’’ 
To my mind, one of the cardinal rules 
is: ‘‘Don’t forget where you come 
from.’’ My grandmother, an immigrant 
from Brazil, worked in the very mill 
building in Lowell where I now have 
my Congressional office. And each day, 
we help people just like her. It is a con-
stant reminder of the community Low-
ell is—welcoming, loyal, diverse, and 
proud. 
Mr. Speaker, in 1996, the Spinners 
came to Lowell, Massachusetts. The 
Spinners are an affiliate of our beloved 
Red Sox, and they play just 30 miles 
away in Fenway Park. Ever since that 
first season, fans from across the 
Merrimack Valley have rallied to them 
each summer. 
The Spinners are today as much a 
part of our city as the Lowell National 
Historical Park, UMass Lowell, and the 
Merrimack River. The city has in-
vested in ensuring that LeLacheur 
Park, where the Spinners play, is 
among the best ballparks in our coun-
try. 
Baseball has deep roots in commu-
nities just like Lowell across the Na-
tion. However, fans of the Spinners and 
41 other teams nationwide, had a rude 
awakening last fall when it was learned 
that a contraction proposal put their 
affiliations at risk. Instead, they were 
offered a pipe dream alternative that 
would almost certainly spell the end of 
professional baseball in these commu-
nities. 
The bill before us notes that: ‘‘Pres-
ervation of Minor League Baseball in 
160 communities is in the public inter-
est, as it will continue to provide af-
fordable, 
family-friendly 
entertain-
ment in those communities.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, these communities de-
serve better than to be forgotten. They 
deserve better than to be considered 
merely in the context of a balance 
sheet. These communities have sup-
ported their teams through thick and 
thin, and they produce the talent that 
we all see on the baseball diamond at 
the major league level. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge MLB: Don’t for-
get where you come from. Baseball has 
always been a game rooted in commu-
nities like mine. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from West 
Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY). 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 6020, and I thank the 
committee, both sides on this, for ad-
vancing this piece of legislation to us. 
My colleague and I from Massachu-
setts, LORI TRAHAN, have been leading 
this fight around the country to pre-
serve Minor League Baseball in 42 com-
munities. 
Baseball in these communities is 
threatened by this proposal by Major 
League Baseball to virtually eliminate 
minor league teams in small towns, 
from Massachusetts to Montana, in 
communities like Charleston, Blue-
field, and Princeton, West Virginia. 
But why is Congress involved? You 
have to understand: For the most part, 
Major League Baseball controls the 
destiny of minor leagues, and they 
should not be allowed to bully these

small communities into submission. 
Our goal is to level the playing field for 
these small towns and ensure that they 
have a voice in this matter. 
Minor League Baseball is a point of 
pride in these cities and towns and 
brings jobs and economic development. 
It provides affordable, family-friendly 
entertainment, and brings people to-
gether for an afternoon at the ballpark 
and, hopefully, creating the next gen-
eration of baseball fans. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is intended to 
show Congress’ commitment to pre-
serving America’s pastime in small 
parts of rural America, far removed 
from the bright lights of major leagues. 
By passing this piece of legislation, we 
will be sending a message that elimi-
nating grassroots baseball in these 42 
communities is an unnecessary burden 
on these small towns, jerking the rug 
out from under baseball towns in rural 
America. 
Look, there are many things in our 
American culture that should matter. 
This 
particular 
legislation 
dem-
onstrates that there are some things in 
our American society, in our culture, 
that should mean more than dollars 
and cents. Major League Baseball needs 
to think about this. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. HAALAND), a member of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, as the 
granddaughter of the founder of the 
first Native-American baseball team in 
Arizona, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 
6020 and Minor League Baseball. 
I thank Chairwoman MALONEY and 
Mrs. MILLER, and the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform staff for their 
wonderful efforts on this issue. 
In the late 1940s and early 1950s, my 
grandfather recognized the talent in 
his community and started up a base-
ball team to help give everyone a shot 
and strengthen our connection to each 
other. My entire family got involved. I 
remember collecting foul balls because 
my grandfather gave us 5 cents for 
each one we retrieved, so we could play 
a role as well. 
As the team started winning State 
championships, more and more people 
wanted to join. My grandfather wel-
comed everyone, making sure that 
America’s pastime would reflect Amer-
ica’s diversity. Communities across the 
country enjoy celebrating with their 
community’s Minor League Baseball 
teams, just like my community with 
my grandfather’s team. 
My home team, the Albuquerque Iso-
topes, filled their stands with an aver-
age of 8,000 people for each of their 
games last year, and sold more than 
half-a-million 
tickets. 
Albuquerque 
would be devastated to lose our team, 
and small businesses that have conces-
sions at the game would suffer im-
mensely. These games equate to jobs in 
my district. 
Major League Baseball may not be 
targeting 
the 
Isotopes 
with 
this 
change, but dozens of communities 
aren’t so lucky. In incredibly unreason-
able negotiations, Major League Base-
ball is trying to force regulations on 
Minor League Baseball that would 
shutter not only teams but also the 
dreams of kids from all walks of life 
who are inspired by the games they 
watch. 
Minor League Baseball provides af-
fordable entertainment and immeas-
urable joy for families that can’t afford 
Major League Baseball games or are 
living in rural parts of our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I fully support the GAO 
report that will show to Major League 
Baseball, and everyone else in our 
country, 
just 
how 
critical 
Minor 
League Baseball has been to the social, 
economic, and historical development 
of our communities. I am excited to go 
back home in May and throw the first 
pitch for the Isotopes game and hope 
that Members of Congress across the 
country can continue to have that 
honor. 
Go ‘Topes. 
Mrs. MILLER. Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to make the gentlewoman from 
New York aware that I have no further 
speakers, and I am prepared to close. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentlewoman for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the great nights 
in Washington, D.C., throughout the 
whole Congressional year, is the night 
we do the Congressional baseball game, 
where Democrats play Republicans at 
the Washington Nationals Park. There 
are 5,000–10,000 people there—maybe 
more, depending on the year—and it 
actually brings everybody together in 
Washington, D.C., which, as many peo-
ple know, is a unique night. Many of 
the players at that game wear their 
local Minor League Baseball uniform 
to represent their local community in 
Washington, 
D.C., 
at 
the 
baseball 
game. 
I have worn the Mahoning Valley 
Scrappers 
uniform 
there. 
The 
Mahoning Valley Scrappers have been 
just outside of Youngstown, Ohio, in 
Niles, Ohio, right by our mall, the 
Eastwood Mall at Eastwood Field, for 
20 years. It is where young people and 
families can go watch professional 
baseball. They can afford it. They can 
hang out. It is a 5- or 10-minute drive. 
It is an important component of our 
community. 
So, of all the ups and downs of our 
economy in northeast Ohio over the 
last 20 years, we have had baseball. 
And now Major League Baseball is say-
ing: We want to cut over 40 teams. And 
what we are saying here in the United 
States Congress is: Congressman BILL 
JOHNSON, Republican—who also rep-
resents part of the area—myself, and 
others, are coming together to try to 
stop this from happening. 
Young people in our area have been 
able to go to this field and watch CC 
Sabathia, 
Francisco 
Lindor, 
Victor 
Martinez, Jose Ramirez—names every-
body knows in Major League Baseball, 
and when they were starting, they 
played in Niles, Ohio. 
So, we want to make sure that we 
prevent this from happening. We want 
to save Minor League Baseball in com-
munities all over the United States. 
b 1230 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
COURTNEY). 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this bipartisan 
measure to draw attention to a really 
horrible development that could occur 
if, again, Congress and the public are 
not watching, which is a proposal by 
Major League Baseball to eliminate 25 
percent of the minor league teams all 
across America. 
I am here next to the logo of the Nor-
wich Sea Unicorns, which is a Class A 
baseball team in Norwich, Connecticut, 
a franchise that goes back decades. As 
many of the other Members have said, 
it provides an affordable family venue 
for people to go to a professional base-
ball game and see the stars of the fu-
ture, something that, with the price of 
tickets of Major League Baseball, 
whether it is Fenway Park, Yankee 
Stadium, or Citi Field in New York 
City, is just far beyond what a working 
family can afford to do. 
The logic of this, in terms of econom-
ics, makes absolutely no sense. Over 
the last 4 years, Minor League Baseball 
has averaged consistently 40 million 
fans. The cost to Major League Base-
ball per franchise is about $400,000 for 
the entire team for a season. 
When you look at the average value 
of a Major League Baseball team, it is 
about $1.78 billion. Again, there are, 
obviously, the really high-rent teams 
like the Yankees in my friend CAROLYN 
MALONEY’s neighborhood, but even the 
smallest is worth over $1 billion. So, 
the notion that Major League Baseball 
is in desperate financial straits just 
does not add up. 
That is why having GAO called upon, 
which this bill does—this isn’t just a 
feel-good bill. It calls on the gold 
standard, the neutral analysts in our 
country to drill down and look at what 
the economic impact would be. And we 
who represent these communities know 
that the impact would be devastating. 
On February 3, we had a rally in Nor-
wich, Connecticut. Hundreds of people 
showed up, the vendors and folks who 
actually benefit from the economic rip-
ple effect of a Minor League Baseball 
team, but also the families and kids, 
the high school baseball teams that use 
the field. 
We need to rise up and stop this de-
velopment, which really goes to the 
heart of our country in terms of its na-
tional pastime. Again, I strongly urge 
all of us to come together and pass this 
resolution. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I have no further

ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LOFGREN) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
756. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress was created by 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI on January 4, 
2019, when the House adopted title II of 
H. Res. 6, the House Rules package. 
The House voted an overwhelming 
418–12 to create the committee. The 
Speaker was insistent that the com-
mittee’s membership contains a di-
verse set of views, which is why its 
membership is evenly divided between 
Republicans and Democrats and is re-
quired to have two first-term Members 
among its ranks. 
I am proud to serve on the Select 
Committee on the Modernization of 
Congress, a committee whose guiding 
principle, in the words of Chairman 
DEREK KILMER, is to ‘‘make Congress 
work better so that the institution and 
its Members can better serve the Amer-
ican people.’’ 
During its first year of work, the 
committee has heard from former 
Members, discussed making legislative 
information more transparent, and fo-
cused on cultivating diversity and im-
proving retention among congressional 
staff. The committee has also worked 
to promote civility and collaboration 
and listened carefully to Members 
about the congressional schedule. 
The committee is already having an 
effect. Shortly after a hearing on con-
gressional 
mailing 
standards, 
the 
Franking Commission moved quickly 
to modernize their rules so Members 
could communicate with their con-
stituents more directly. 
The committee’s success is the very 
reason that the Speaker decided to ex-
tend the life of the committee. Origi-
nally scheduled to conclude its work 
after the first session, the House 
agreed to extend its work for the bal-
ance of the 116th Congress. 
I was pleased to work with the rank-
ing member of the House Administra-
tion Committee to make sure that the 
select committee has the resources it 
needs to do its work. 
H. Res. 756 incorporates the first two 
sets of recommendations made by the 
select committee. These recommenda-
tions focus on increasing transparency, 
improving human resources practices 
on the Hill, improving the onboarding 
process for new Members, addressing 
needed IT improvements, and making 
the proceedings and functions of the 
House more accessible to all Ameri-
cans. 
It has been a pleasure to work with 
Chairman 
KILMER, 
Vice 
Chairman 
GRAVES, and the ranking member on 
the Committee on House Administra-
tion as we have worked to translate 
recommendations into legislation. 
Successful reform efforts in Congress 
are rare. For the most part, these ef-
forts fade away and are forgotten. I am 
glad that this reform effort, spear-
headed by the bipartisan work of the 
select committee, is moving forward 
and that we will all see tangible results 
in how the Congress operates as a re-
sult of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS) controls the time 
and is recognized. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 756, the Moving Our Democ-
racy and Congressional Operations To-
wards Modernization Resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan resolu-
tion is an important one that I believe 
will improve the day-to-day operations 
of the House. 
I first want to thank Chairman KIL-
MER and Vice Chair GRAVES for their 
impressive leadership of the Select 
Committee on Modernization. 
I also want to give a special moment 
of silence in honor of Vice Chair 
GRAVES’ son, who was in a bad accident 
on a bicycle. If Members could bear 
with me to honor Mr. GRAVES and have 
a moment of silence to pray for his 
son’s recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, the tone that has been 
set at the Select Committee on the 
Modernization of Congress has been a 
refreshing reminder that there is still a 
way to work in a truly bipartisan man-
ner, 
respecting 
differing 
opinions 
across the aisle. Six Members of Con-
gress from each party came together to 
work toward a common goal: to make 
this institution better. 
Americans deserve an efficient and 
effective 
legislature. 
A 
modernized 
Congress will increase our ability to re-
spond to the needs of communities; 
save taxpayer dollars; erase layers of 
bureaucracy; 
further 
professionalize 
the institution; and revitalize a trans-
parent, understandable, and efficient 
legislative process. 
H. Res. 756 is a package of 29 bipar-
tisan recommendations from the select 
committee’s findings on ways to im-
prove Congress. These recommenda-
tions will increase public accessibility, 
modernize the information technology 
that offices use, streamline human re-
sources, improve training offerings, en-
hance the ways we can communicate 
with our constituents, and create more 
transparency and access to public doc-
uments, among other necessary ad-
vancements. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a proud member of 
the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress, and as the 
ranking member at the Committee on 
House Administration, I look forward 
to working toward implementing these 
vital recommendations. 
While the passage of H. Res. 756 is 
crucial for improving how the House 
operates, I know the work is not done. 
I look forward to being a part of mov-
ing additional pieces of legislation the 
select committee puts forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER) who chairs the Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization 
of Congress. 
Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chair LOFGREN and Ranking Member 
DAVIS for their support in bringing this 
resolution to the floor. 
H. Res. 756, the MODCOM Resolution, 
is the product of a bipartisan desire to 
make Congress work better for the 
American people. 
Over the past year, the Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress has taken a hard look at the 
many challenges this institution faces. 
Select committee members have lis-
tened closely to what their colleagues 
and staff have to say about how to im-
prove Congress and listened to the 
American people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1572 
March 10, 2020 
Through a collaborative, bipartisan 
process, the select committee has so 
far passed 45 recommendations to make 
Congress work better so that Members 
can better serve their constituents. 
Making recommendations to improve 
Congress is one thing, but making sure 
those recommendations are carried out 
is quite another. 
The Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress is the first re-
form committee in recent history to 
turn its recommendations into legisla-
tion. The MODCOM Resolution ensures 
that the select committee’s initial rec-
ommendations are implemented by the 
House of Representatives. 
These 
recommendations 
cover 
a 
broad range of issues but share a com-
mon goal: making Congress work bet-
ter for the American people. 
Article I of the Constitution estab-
lished Congress as the first among co-
equal branches of government. Our 
Founding Fathers envisioned a strong 
legislative branch, but Congress’ capac-
ity to uphold its constitutional powers 
has been weakened. This resolution is a 
first step toward restoring capacity 
and strengthening Congress. 
The 
resolution 
improves 
trans-
parency so that the American people 
can easily access basic information 
about Congress, including following the 
bill through the process, seeing how 
Members vote in committee and on the 
floor, and tracking what bills Members 
sponsor. 
The MODCOM Resolution also con-
tains recommendations focused on at-
tracting and retaining a diverse and 
highly 
qualified 
workforce, 
again, 
working on behalf of the American peo-
ple. The resolution creates a one-stop 
HR shop to help Members and staff 
with questions about recruitment, re-
tention, diversity, legal counsel, train-
ing, and benefits. 
The select committee has heard a lot 
about how new Member orientation 
should do more to encourage civility 
and bipartisan collaboration. This reso-
lution will overhaul the onboarding 
process for new Members and provide 
continuing education opportunities for 
all Members. 
Select 
committee 
members 
also 
agree that trying to solve 21st century 
problems 
with 
20th 
century 
tech-
nologies is a disservice to the Amer-
ican people, who rightfully expect 
timely action from their Representa-
tives. This resolution will modernize 
House technologies and, ultimately, 
save taxpayer dollars. 
b 1245 
Modernizing Congress also means 
making the proceedings and functions 
of the House accessible to all Ameri-
cans. The MODCOM resolution address-
es the equal access challenges that per-
sons with disabilities face when work-
ing for, visiting, or interacting with 
Congress. 
The bottom line is this: All Members 
want Congress to work better for the 
American people, and the MODCOM 
resolution serves that goal. 
I am proud to lead this effort, but I 
want to emphasize that this is an en-
tirely collaborative effort. Congress-
man TOM GRAVES, the select commit-
tee’s vice chair, has been a great part-
ner, and I want to thank him for his 
leadership, his partnership, and his 
commitment to the committee’s suc-
cess. 
I thank the gentleman from Illinois 
for wishing Tom and his family well 
and wishing his son a speedy recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, the experience and per-
spective of Chair LOFGREN
and of 
Ranking Member DAVIS
they have 
shared with the select committee has 
also been invaluable. I want to thank 
them and the Committee on House Ad-
ministration and their staff for their 
help and their guidance and for their 
work in bringing this resolution to the 
floor today. 
I also want to thank all of my col-
leagues on the select committee. We 
serve with such thoughtful and dedi-
cated Members, and I look forward to 
our continued collaboration. 
The CAO’s office and the House 
Clerk’s office have also been instru-
mental in this effort, and I want to 
thank the many people in both offices 
who have given of their time and exper-
tise in working through a lot of these 
issues with the select committee. 
This is the first step in trying to 
make Congress function better on be-
half of the American people. There is 
more to come. The committee has ad-
ditional 
recommendations 
that 
we 
hope to move forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support passage of H. Res. 756. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Washington 
(Mr. 
NEWHOUSE), my good friend and an-
other member of the Select Committee 
on the Modernization of Congress. 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank my good friend, Mr. DAVIS, for 
yielding and thank him also for all of 
his hard work bringing this resolution 
to the floor. I also want to thank him 
for being here in person himself to help 
us argue the good points of this resolu-
tion and its bipartisan nature. 
Mr. Speaker, for over a year, the bi-
partisan Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress has worked to-
gether to discuss how Congress, as an 
institution, conducts business on be-
half of the American people. 
From broad subjects, like govern-
ment transparency and congressional 
office payroll, to narrower topics, like 
formatting legislative documents, our 
goal is to bring Congress into the same 
century as the constituents whom we 
serve. 
This resolution is a great first step in 
accomplishing that goal. It requires 
our technology offices to streamline 
the approval process for new and inno-
vative technologies. It takes steps to-
wards Housewide bulk purchasing of 
technology products and services and 
will save every Member money out of 
their MRAs. 
Additionally, the resolution exam-
ines expanding or eliminating the cap 
on the number of employees for Mem-
ber offices. Many Members, particu-
larly in rural areas like my district in 
central Washington, have multiple dis-
trict offices, and Members should be 
able to staff their offices as they see 
fit. 
Empowering Members to adequately 
staff both district and D.C. offices can 
improve retention, but, more impor-
tantly, it can improve communication 
with our constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like 
to again thank Chairman KILMER and 
Ranking Member GRAVES
for their 
leadership and their work in bringing 
this resolution to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues, all Members, to support the 
adoption of this resolution. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. 
BROOKS), another member of the Select 
Committee on the Modernization of 
Congress. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to join my fellow col-
leagues on the Select Committee on 
the Modernization of Congress in sup-
port of H. Res. 756. 
Over these past many months, under 
the incredible leadership of Represent-
ative 
KILMER
and 
Representative 
GRAVES, the members of the Select 
Committee on the Modernization of 
Congress have worked diligently to ad-
dress many, many issues that we be-
lieve in a bipartisan way have nega-
tively impacted the ability of Congress 
to work effectively and efficiently for 
all Americans. 
Throughout my time in Congress, I 
have heard time after time many con-
cerns from my constituents who be-
lieve that Congress has become too 
mired in gridlock, that our current po-
litical process has devolved into a sys-
tem that rewards bitter partisan divide 
rather than an effective, for-the-people 
governance. I think my constituents 
would be so pleased, and all of our con-
stituents would be so pleased, to see 
how this committee has worked and 
how we have plodded together through 
many difficult subjects. 
In the process of creating 21⁄2 dozen 
recommendations, including this reso-
lution, I think a couple of the most im-
portant the committee is focused on 
are how to foster that more civil dis-
course, beginning with new Member 
orientation. 
I want to applaud the chair and the 
ranking member of the Committee on 
House Administration for being so 
open-minded about any ideas that our 
committee put forward, willing to 
make changes to many programs, be-
ginning with new Member orientation; 
also, efforts to create a congressional 
workforce more representative of our 
country’s diverse population through 
initiatives like making permanent the 
Office of Diversity and Inclusion, and 
focusing on issues such as streamlining

and reorganizing human resource serv-
ices for the House of Representatives. 
We often operate as 435 different of-
fices, but we can learn so much from 
each other. We can find, with collabo-
ration and with a stronger H.R. office, 
better expertise in communications 
policies and constituent services. 
So it is my firm belief that the rec-
ommendations being voted on will be 
an integral step in moving Congress 
forward in a direction that not only 
produces a more productive workforce 
and workplace, but a more productive 
legislative branch. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
South 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
TIMMONS), our freshman Member on 
our side of the aisle on the Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress. 
Mr. TIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H. Res. 756, 
legislation implementing recommenda-
tions from the Select Committee on 
the Modernization of Congress. 
The Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress, the only truly 
bipartisan committee in Congress, has 
worked diligently since it was created 
to produce recommendations that will 
make Congress more efficient, account-
able, and transparent to the American 
people. 
This resolution includes nearly 30 of 
the recommendations passed out of the 
committee. The legislation includes re-
forms in five areas, which are: 
Streamlining 
and 
reorganizing 
human resources; 
Improving orientation for freshman 
Members; 
Modernizing and revitalizing tech-
nology; 
Making the House accessible to all; 
and 
Improving access to documents and 
publications for the American people. 
When I first arrived in Washington 
for new Member orientation, I remem-
ber having to get on a bus with only 
Republicans. I was shocked that new 
Members would not be briefed together, 
that this kind of partisanship was en-
couraged from the very start. 
Now, I understand that a majority of 
the time Members will be meeting with 
their respective party, but to encour-
age this divide from the beginning was 
something I was not expecting—and I 
was really disappointed. 
This contributes to the brokenness 
and lack of civility in Congress. This 
was a concern I heard from several 
Members from both sides of the aisle, 
including fellow colleagues on the Se-
lect Committee on the Modernization 
of Congress. 
I am proud that we are able to work 
together on this committee as both Re-
publicans and Democrats to come to a 
solution that encourages more biparti-
sanship in these partisan and incred-
ibly divided times. 
I am truly thankful for Chair KIL-
MER’s and Vice Chair GRAVES’ leader-
ship on the committee, and I look for-
ward to continuing to work with them 
and my colleagues on the committee 
on other ways we can make Congress 
more efficient, such as addressing the 
House calendar and schedule, as well as 
the budget process. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues in the House to support H. Res. 
756. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, at this point, while he mean-
ders up to the microphone, I would like 
to say this is our last speaker, but an-
other valued member of the Select 
Committee on the Modernization of 
Congress, somebody whom not only the 
committee is going to miss when he 
leaves this institution after this term, 
but this institution is going to miss 
him. 
I yield as much time as he would like 
to consume to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. WOODALL). 
Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Illinois for yielding. I 
have so many things that I want to say 
now in light of that. 
The truth is, Mr. Speaker, I just 
came over, had to walk out on some 
constituents to be here. 
Hunter Pruett is in town. He is advo-
cating on behalf of the Juvenile Arthri-
tis Foundation, and he has been meet-
ing with me every year for the 10 years 
I have been in Congress. 
I said: Hunter, I am sorry. I have got 
to go to the floor. This is our bill 
today. I will see you back home. 
He said: I just want to tell you one 
thing, ROB. 
He said: Whatever is going on in poli-
tics, just forget it. What I want you to 
do for your next 9 months in Congress 
is just go and do the right thing for the 
right reasons, and we will be with you. 
That is a pretty common message 
that we get, but our committee process 
doesn’t always allow that to happen, 
and I want to thank the chairman for 
leading a process that has allowed ex-
actly that to happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know if it has 
been mentioned, but I am looking at 
the chairman of the Select Committee 
on the Modernization of Congress sit-
ting beside the chairwoman of the 
House Administration Committee. 
Now, as you look through these 30 
recommendations today, you will see 
that a lot of them have to do with 
House Administration jurisdiction. I 
am standing right beside the ranking 
member of the House Administration 
Committee. 
It is extraordinary in this institution 
for a chairwoman and her ranking 
member to allow another committee to 
have any sort of input on what goes on, 
much less delegate some of that con-
versation and thinking. The lack of 
self-interest that has gone into this 
committee is something I haven’t got-
ten to see much in the 10 years I have 
been here. 
You won’t see in these recommenda-
tions, Mr. Speaker, a recommendation 
to turn all of the committees into the 
exact same bipartisan 50/50 committee 
that we have had the pleasure of work-
ing on. I don’t think you will see that 
in the next round either. 
But I will tell you that one of the fa-
vorite stories I get to tell back home to 
folks who feel like politics has taken 
over this town, for folks who feel like 
MSNBC and FOX News run this institu-
tion these days, that think Twitter is 
the be-all and end-all of in-depth polit-
ical thought, I have gotten a chance to 
work with Members who have, time 
after time after time, put the institu-
tion first with one goal in mind. 
Mr. Speaker, I am certain it has been 
said already, how can we serve our con-
stituency better, every single conversa-
tion, how can we serve our constitu-
ency better; what can we do to better 
serve the American people; how is the 
institution broken, not so that it is not 
serving Members, but so that Members 
are not serving their constituents. 
I know this isn’t the most glamorous 
of topics, modernization of Congress, 
but I would just say to all of my col-
leagues, if you are feeling down, if you 
are feeling beaten by a political season, 
if you think that this is the time of the 
electoral cycle where folks are fussing 
with each other, more likely to tear 
each other down than build each other 
up, read these 30 recommendations. 
Tune in to the next Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress, Mr. Speaker, because what you 
are going to see is exactly what every 
single one of us wanted to see when we 
ran for Congress, and that is serious 
men and women sitting down in a col-
laborative way, putting the American 
people first. 
It couldn’t happen without the lead-
ership of our chairman. It wouldn’t 
happen without the chairwoman of the 
House Administration Committee and 
her willingness to be such a productive 
partner. It couldn’t happen without 
Ranking Member DAVIS and his will-
ingness to be so involved and so col-
laborative. 
There should be recommendation No. 
31, Mr. Speaker, and that is, let’s do 
this again. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, in closing, I can’t add any-
thing to what my good friend ROBERT 
‘‘FRANK’’ WOODALL said, so I am going 
to yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, in clos-
ing, I want to again acknowledge the 
bipartisan work of the Select Com-
mittee on the Modernization of Con-
gress. 
As a body, we haven’t focused on the 
need for internal reforms to improve 
our work for the American people, and 
the Select Committee on the Mod-
ernization of Congress has enabled us 
to focus on reforms and improvements 
that are necessary to better serve our 
constituents. 
It may be true, if you read the re-
ports, some of this is boring. Boring is 
good. To get these things done in a 
very thoughtful, collaborative way so 
the system works better, so we can 
serve our constituents better, it has

been a pleasure to work here, both as a 
member of the Select Committee and 
certainly as chair of the House Admin-
istration Committee charged with im-
plementing 
many 
of 
these 
rec-
ommendations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge that all of us sup-
port H. Res. 756, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as 
Vice Chair of the Select Committee on the 
Modernization of Congress, I want to express 
my strong support for H. Res. 756, the Moving 
our Democracy and Congressional Operations 
Towards Modernization Resolution. 
This resolution is the result of bipartisan col-
laboration and hard work by our committee 
members, who are committed to making Con-
gress work better for the American people. 
H. Res. 756 marks the first time in recent 
history a select committee like ours has turned 
recommendations into legislative action. This 
is a testament to the hard work of our mem-
bers, and the support from our colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle has been instrumental 
throughout this process. 
In the last year, the Select Committee has 
passed nearly four dozen recommendations 
crafted to make Congress more effective, effi-
cient and transparent. Through conversations 
with our colleagues and listening sessions with 
congressional staff, we’ve worked to address 
everything from staff retention and recruitment 
to boosting bipartisanship and civility through-
out the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Today’s resolution addresses five key sec-
tions of reform: streamlining and reorganizing 
human resources; improving orientation for 
Members-elect and providing improved con-
tinuing education opportunities for Members; 
modernizing and revitalizing technology, mak-
ing the House accessible to all; and improving 
access to documents and publications. These 
sections include 29 recommendations that 
were unanimously passed by our committee 
on a rolling basis throughout last year—an-
other first for a committee like ours. 
We’re committed to pushing boundaries and 
breaking the mold with our approach and the 
solutions we propose. Our chair, Rep. Derek 
Kilmer, has been a strong leader and bipar-
tisan partner throughout this process. When 
the Select Committee first started, we chose 
to work together and combine our resources 
as one team, instead of separating the staff 
and office space by party line. This unique op-
portunity and approach has created a bond of 
trust unlike anything I’ve experienced in Con-
gress. 
We have more work to do before the year 
is over, and I can think of no better capstone 
to my career in public service than to leave 
Congress in better shape for the next genera-
tion of leaders. Together we are giving the 
House a roadmap for a brighter future. 
I look forward to continuing our work as a 
bipartisan team and am grateful for the oppor-
tunity to help make a little history here in the 
House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms.

SUPPORT FOR VETERANS IN EF-
FECTIVE APPRENTICESHIPS ACT 
OF 2019 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (S. 760) to enable registered appren-
ticeship programs to better serve vet-
erans, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 760 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Support for 
Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act of 
2019’’. 
SEC. 2. IMPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM 
COORDINATION BETWEEN THE DE-
PARTMENT OF LABOR AND THE DE-
PARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this Act: 
(1) REGISTERED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.— 
The term ‘‘registered apprenticeship pro-
gram’’ means an apprenticeship program reg-
istered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (50 
Stat. 664; commonly referred to as the ‘‘Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act’’). 
(2) 
SECRETARY.—The 
term 
‘‘Secretary’’ 
means the Secretary of Labor. 
(b) ADDITIONAL
REGISTERED
APPRENTICE-
SHIP
PROGRAM
REQUIREMENTS.—Notwith-
standing any other provision of law, for any 
program applying to become a registered ap-
prenticeship program on or after the date 
that is 180 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall— 
(1) acquire from the program sponsor a 
written assurance that the sponsor— 
(A) is aware of the availability of edu-
cational assistance for a veteran or other in-
dividual eligible under chapters 30 through 36 
of title 38, United States Code, for use in 
connection with a registered apprenticeship 
program; 
(B) will make a good faith effort to obtain

program location that employs or recruits a 
veteran or other individual eligible for edu-
cational 
assistance 
under 
chapters 
30 
through 36 of title 38, United States Code; 
and 
(C) will not deny the application of a quali-
fied candidate who is a veteran or other indi-
vidual eligible for educational assistance de-
scribed in subparagraph (A) for the purpose 
of avoiding making a good faith effort to ob-
tain approval as described in subparagraph 
(B); 
(2) in accordance with paragraphs (5) and 
(12) of section 29.5(b) of title 29, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (as in effect on the day be-

plicable to the apprenticeship occupation; or 
(ii) has acquired experience, training, or 
skills through military service that is appli-
cable to the apprenticeship occupation; and 
(3) when the Secretary approves the reg-
istered apprenticeship program, provide a 
copy of the program’s certificate of registra-
tion to the State approving agency des-
ignated under chapter 36 of title 38, United 
States Code, in the State where the program 
is located. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) and the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. WATKINS) each will 
control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Nevada. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks, and 
insert extraneous material on S. 760, 
the Support for Veterans in Effective 
Apprenticeships Act of 2019. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Nevada? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 760, Support for Veterans in Effec-
tive Apprenticeships Act. This legisla-
tion is a commonsense approach to 
helping men and women who have laid 
their life on the line for our freedom. 
So many of our veterans transition 
to civilian life and need to develop a 
skill to get good-paying jobs. Yet, 
many are not suited for traditional 
education pathways. This is where reg-
istered apprenticeship programs are so 
important, and this legislation takes 
important steps to increasing veterans’ 
access to complete financial assistance 
they can use to connect to a registered 
apprenticeship program. 
Registered apprenticeships are our 
Nation’s 
most 
successful 
federally 
funded workforce development with a 
94 percent placement rate for workers 
who complete a registered apprentice-
ship, and an average starting salary of 
$70,000 a year. The bill would ensure 
more veterans access to these high- 
quality programs by: 
One, requiring the Department of 
Labor, DOL, to ensure employers are 
working with their State veterans af-
fairs agencies to obtain education ben-
efits available for veterans; 
Two, improving the coordination be-
tween the DOL and the VA, requiring 
the DOL to provide information to the 
VA on newly registered apprenticeship 
programs to enable the VA to be more 
proactive in outreach to registered ap-
prenticeship programs not yet ap-
proved for GI bill benefits; and 
Three, ensuring that employers grant 
advanced standing or credit, and pro-
vide increased wages commensurate to 
such standing or credit to veterans or

other eligible individuals who can dem-
onstrate competencies or experience, 
training or skills through their mili-
tary service. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in support of this important 
legislation, which will take real steps 
to improve veterans and their families 
access to high-quality registered ap-
prenticeship programs. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of S. 760, the 
Support for Veterans in Effective Ap-
prenticeships Act. This bill would pro-
vide more opportunities for service-
members within apprenticeship pro-
grams that align with their skills and 
their background. 
As a veteran, one of the hardest 
things I did was transitioning back to 
the civilian world. I spent somewhere 
around 81⁄2 years in conflict environ-
ments over the course of maybe 12 or 
13, and it was easier to stay in Iraq or 
Afghanistan than it was to come back 
to the United States. 
Now, we have got an outstanding 
military. It is resilient and bright; 
many fought in two wars. They have 
excellent 
leadership 
and 
technical 
skills, skills that would be used to 
close the skills gap. Veterans are more 
likely to be underemployed than their 
nonveteran counterparts. This is not 
because they lack the appropriate 
skills, rather, they lack the clear path 
that helps them to transition from the 
military service to good-paying jobs. 
S. 760 ensures that veterans receive 
advanced standings in registered ap-
prenticeship programs for their prior 
experience. This bill acknowledges the 
unique capabilities of veterans and 
simplifies the process for veterans 
transitioning from successful careers 
in the military to civilian life. 
We have a wealth of experience right 
here in our country with our veterans. 
Let’s tap into that pool of intelligent 
and hardworking heroes. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Nevada and the gentleman from 
Kansas for their support of this very 
important piece of legislation. 
I rise in support of S. 760, the Support 
for Veterans in Effective Apprentice-
ships Act of 2019. I was proud to intro-
duce the House companion bill, H.R. 
5314, with my colleague, Representa-
tive KATHERINE CLARK. 
Our Nation’s veterans deserve our 
support while deployed and when they 
return home. One of the best ways to 
do that is to prepare them for the 
workforce outside of the military. 
Our servicemembers have attained 
incredible skills during their service, 
many times, quite frankly, under fire. 
Sadly, when they return to civilian 
life, finding a good-paying, family-sus-
taining job may be difficult. 
Many States have significant incon-
sistencies between the number of reg-
istered apprenticeships offered and the 
number of programs listed as approved 
for veterans’ benefits. These discrep-
ancies exist despite the simple, expe-
dited VA approval process for appren-
ticeship 
sponsors 
who 
have 
gone 
through all the steps to register their 
programs through the Department of 
Labor at either the Federal or the 
State level. 
The VA approval process still re-
quires additional steps that not all 
sponsors follow through to completion. 
This makes it difficult in many States 
for veterans to have the full list of ap-
prenticeship programs where they can 
use their earned benefits and apply 
their learned skills and knowledge. 
H.R. 5314 helps streamline the proc-
ess of attaining an apprenticeship and 
reduces roadblocks for our veterans. 
The 
bill 
ensures 
programs 
are 
equipped to complete the expedited VA 
process for registered apprenticeships 
and expands coordination between the 
Department of Labor and the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs. 
Now, additionally, the bill clarifies 
that veterans are eligible for advanced 
placement and appropriate wage in-
creases and instructs apprenticeship 
programs to account for a participant’s 
competencies and prior experiences, in-
cluding those gained during military 
service. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this bill, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
am prepared to close, if the gentleman 
from Kansas is, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I am 
ready to close. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 760 would help vet-
erans transition to the civilian work-
force and address our growing skills 
gaps that has led to 7 million unfilled 
jobs. This bill is a clear win for our 
country, and I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
The Support for Veterans in Effective 
Apprenticeships Act, S. 760, will assist 
our veterans and their families in ac-
cessing the high-quality pathways that 
registered apprenticeships provide. 
As I said before, we owe it to our 
brave veterans to set them up for a life 
of self-sufficiency and dignity. This 
legislation does not create another bu-
reaucratic layer that veterans must 
navigate, instead, it requires coordina-
tion. Coordination between the DOL 
and the VA that will reduce barriers 
for employers and veterans and access-
ing financial assistance they can use in 
connection with the registered appren-
ticeship program. 
We have all heard stories of veterans 
having to navigate complex require-
ments to access benefits that, quite 
honestly, they have earned and de-
serve. This legislation proves that this 
Congress has heard our veterans, and 
we are taking concrete steps to reduce 
barriers by cutting red tape. 
Mr. Speaker, I don’t know why any-
one would be opposed to that, which is 
why I urge my colleagues to support 
the legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Nevada (Mrs. 
LEE) that the House suspend the rules 
and pass the bill, S. 760. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

FEDERALLY REQUIRING EARNED 
EDUCATION-DEBT 
DISCHARGES 
FOR VETS ACT 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
move to suspend the rules and pass the 
bill (H.R. 3598) to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to automatically 
discharge the loans of certain veteran 
borrowers, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3598 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Federally 
Requiring Earned Education-debt Discharges 
for Vets Act’’ or the ‘‘FREED Vets Act’’. 
SEC. 2. AUTOMATIC LOAN DISCHARGE FOR CER-
TAIN VETERAN BORROWERS. 
Section 437(a) of the Higher Education Act 
of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1087(a)) is amended— 
(1) by striking paragraph (2) and inserting 
the following: 
‘‘(2) DISABILITY DETERMINATIONS.—With re-
spect to a borrower who has been identified 
under clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (4)(A), 
the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(A) consider the borrower permanently

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 3598, 
the FREED Vets Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Nevada? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 3598, 
the Federally Requiring Earned Edu-
cation-Debt Discharges for Vets Act or 
FREED Vets Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
CONOR LAMB, BRIAN FITZPATRICK, and 
all the other coleads for their work to 
ensure that those who have served our 
Nation, and are now totally and perma-
nently disabled, do not face additional 
burden to get relief from their student 
loan debt. 
This legislation will improve the 
lives of nearly 40,000 veterans who have 
a service-related disability by requir-
ing the Secretary of Education to auto-
matically discharge their Federal stu-
dent loan debt. 
The Higher Education Act of 1965 re-
quires the Secretary of Education to 
discharge the Federal student loans of 
individuals who are totally and perma-
nently disabled but does not establish a 
process. For too long, veterans with a 
service-connected disability have fallen 
through the cracks. Because of that, 
they have been forced to navigate a 
complicated 
and 
confusing 
system, 
while being straddled with debt. We 
owe our disabled veterans a better op-
tion. 
So, in 2018, the Department of Edu-
cation launched a data-sharing initia-
tive with the Department of Veterans 
Affairs to identify borrowers eligible 
for relief from their student loan debt. 
b 1315 
In 2019, the Department of Education 
started to automize loan discharge for 
these veterans, but it has been stalled. 
This bill will require the Secretary to 
continue matching borrowers with data 
from Veterans Affairs to identify and 
automatically discharge the debt of 
matched individuals, eliminating bur-
den on our veterans. 
These brave individuals who served 
our country and are now totally and 
permanently disabled should not have 
to carry the burden of their debt, espe-
cially when we have the information 
and the ability to eliminate all sorts of 
bureaucratic and, quite frankly, unnec-
essary red tape. 
I am proud to support this legislation 
which creates a clear process for dis-
abled veterans to receive the relief 
they are entitled to under the law. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3598, the Federally Requiring 
Earned Education-debt Discharges for 
Vets Act, or the FREED Vets Act. This 
bill would cancel student loan debt for 
some eligible veterans. 
H.R. 3598 would remove administra-
tive obstacles preventing veterans from 
receiving student loan discharges. It 
modernizes the administration of Fed-
eral student loans, and it is a wonder-
ful way to honor veterans. 
Most debate about student loans is 
highly contentious and very partisan, 
but this bill here and now is an exam-
ple of Democrats and Republicans com-
ing together for the benefit of Amer-
ican heroes. 
Last year, President Trump signed 
an executive order eliminating a proc-
ess for disabled veterans to become eli-
gible for loan forgiveness. Today, we 
are here to ensure that this effort be-
comes permanent. 
I am a veteran, and I have countless 
veteran friends, many of them disabled. 
I know this bill will matter. Our vet-
erans could use this break after selfless 
service, most of whom fought in not 
one war, but two—or many, at least. 
The FREED Act is just one example 
of this body’s commitment and Amer-
ica’s commitment to our Nation’s brav-
est. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY). 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the FREED Vets 
Act, a bipartisan measure led by my 
friend CONOR LAMB from Pennsylvania 
and BRIAN
FITZPATRICK, Republican, 
from Pennsylvania, that will automati-
cally discharge Federal student loan 
debt for eligible permanently disabled 
veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, there is about a trillion 
dollars of student loan debt over-
hanging the U.S. economy, and we have 
worked on the Education and Labor 
Committee to pass the College Afford-
ability Act that would open a pathway 
for people who serve in public service 
to get that debt discharged after 10 
years. 
This bill is, in my opinion, a great 
example of bipartisan agreement that 
there is one population that should get 
immediate relief, which is the men and 
women who have worn the uniform of 
this country and who have suffered 
grievous injury, whether it is visible or 
invisible, and who are 100 percent dis-
abled. 
As again has been stated, the Edu-
cation Department got off to a start in 
terms of trying to implement this type 
of approach. This bill just will again 
strengthen and support that effort to 
make sure that the minute the VA has 
identified an individual who is perma-
nently disabled who served our Nation, 
that notice will go to the Education 
Department and the discharge will be 
automatic. No application process, no 
matching process, again, it will just 
happen by operation of law. 
The statistics show that this is a real 
problem. There are 42,000 veterans with 
student loan debt who, again, are per-
manently disabled, and 25,000 of those 
are in default. Getting this bill passed, 
getting this in operation as soon as 
possible is the most powerful way this 
country can say thank you, to elimi-
nate one additional burden on people 
who have just shown their commit-
ment and patriotism to our country. 
I congratulate the bipartisan spon-
sors of this bill, Mr. LAMB and Mr. 
FITZPATRICK, and urge all of us to come 
together and get this bill passed today, 
as soon as possible. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB), the sponsor 
of the bill. 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague for yielding. I thank my col-
league from Kansas for his excellent 
support and work on this bill, as well. 
People often ask me when I go home 
to western Pennsylvania whether we 
ever knock off all the fighting down 
here and do some actual work and 
work across the aisle between Congress 
and the White House to actually get 
things done. What you are seeing here 
in this Chamber today is an example of 
the fact that there are many of us 
down here who are very serious about 
making that happen and making it 
happen more often as we go forward. 
The FREED Act responded to a very 
specific set of circumstances, which is 
that it has long been true that, if you 
are a 100 percent disabled veteran, you 
have your Federal student loans for-
given. But we all know there is a big 
difference between putting something

down on paper and making it happen in 
real life, and we were seeing huge num-
bers of disabled veterans not take ad-
vantage of this program either because 
they didn’t know about it or because 
the process of applying for it was just 
too burdensome, there was too much 
paperwork, or it took too long. 
If you have a 100 percent disability 
rating, there is a lot in your life you 
have to worry about besides doing pa-
perwork; so Congressman WATKINS, 
Congressman FITZPATRICK and another 
great 
western 
Pennsylvanian, 
Con-
gressman GUY RESCHENTHALER, and I 
were all looking at the same set of 
facts and said: We know what we need 
to do here. We already know these peo-
ple have a 100 percent disability rating. 
Let’s just make the loan forgiveness 
automatic. That was the genesis for 
this bill. 
I want to acknowledge that the ad-
ministration and President Trump did 
the right thing here. They noticed this 
same problem last year, and they 
began to automatically forgive these 
loans by executive order. The problem 
was that there was some legal uncer-
tainty about exactly who had the au-
thority to forgive the loans how fast 
and when. 
Our understanding is that some dis-
putes developed between OMB and the 
Department of Education, and it was 
slowing down the ability of veterans to 
take advantage of this thing that they 
are already entitled to by virtue of how 
much they have given to this country. 
So our bill was necessary to make sure 
that everybody involved knew they 
have the legal authority to forgive 
these loans. 
By this time next year, assuming we 
are able to get this through the Senate 
and to the President’s desk for his sig-
nature, that number you heard from 
Congressman COURTNEY of 25,000 vet-
erans whose loans are in default and an 
even higher number of tens of thou-
sands more who haven’t taken advan-
tage of that should be zero. 
We are making an unequivocal state-
ment today that, if you have given so 
much to this country that you have a 
100 percent disability rating, you do 
not need to worry about your Federal 
student loans any longer. 
It is our job to remove obstacles from 
the paths of people who have given so 
much to this country. We all believe 
that there is much to be done on the 
subject of student loans, but what we 
want to make sure is that these brave 
Americans are first in line when we do 
that, and that is what our bill does. 
It is very common in America these 
days to hear people spot a veteran and 
say, ‘‘Thank you for your service.’’ I 
think the important thing about this 
bill is that it is Republicans and Demo-
crats, Congress and the President all 
working together to say, ‘‘Thank you 
for your service’’—not only in words, 
but in actions. That is what this bill 
means. 
I am so grateful to have had the sup-
port of so many hardworking Members 
who look forward to seeing this bill 
pass today, and I urge all my col-
leagues to support it. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, the 
FREED Vets Act mandates that the 
Department of Education automati-
cally discharge Federal student loan 
debt for eligible permanently disabled 
veterans. The staggering student loan 
debt crisis harms the financial security 
of many Americans, including the 
women and men who have honorably 
served our Nation. 
Our Nation’s veterans have sacrificed 
immensely for our freedom and our 
way of life, and it is unacceptable that 
many disabled veterans continue to be 
saddled with high levels of student 
debt. The least we can do for them, Mr. 
Speaker, is to forgive the Federal stu-
dent loans for those who have served 
our country. 
The VA established a program in 2018 
to forgive veteran student debt, but the 
barrier of going through the processes 
meant that only 20 percent of those eli-
gible veterans received the assistance 
they deserved. This strong bipartisan 
bill makes student loan forgiveness for 
these vets automatic. 
I thank my friend, Congressman 
LAMB from Pennsylvania, for leading 
this bill, and I urge all my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to stand with 
our veterans today and vote for H.R. 
3598. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank the President for all he has 
done for our veterans. I thank the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB) 
as well as the gentlewoman from Ne-
vada (Mrs. LEE) for all of their hard 
work in making this piece of legisla-
tion a reality. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 3598. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
As my colleagues have heard today, 
this legislation would require the De-
partment to continue ensuring that 
veterans who are totally and perma-
nently disabled can have their student 
loan debt discharged without unneces-
sary complexity. 
Think about it, without unnecessary 
complexity. 
All this legislation does is streamline 
a process so those who have been to-
tally and permanently disabled can 
have peace of mind and economic free-
dom. We owe it to those who have 
served our country to make this proc-
ess as simple as possible, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
COURTNEY). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
3598, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 1 o’clock and 27 min-

RECOGNIZING 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF AFFORDABLE CARE ACT 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, this 
month marks the 10-year anniversary 
of the Affordable Care Act, which ex-
panded healthcare coverage to millions 
of Americans, including those with pre-
existing conditions. 
However, the ACA has also been at-
tacked and undermined over the last 
decade, with the latest attempt origi-
nating from my home State of Texas. 
Texas, which has refused to expand 
Medicaid even though the State has 
the highest uninsured rate in the Na-
tion, and the Trump administration 
argue that the entire law should be dis-
mantled. 
With the Supreme Court announcing 
they will hear the case this fall, over 
44,000 El Pasoans are again living with 
the threat of having their healthcare 
coverage taken away from them. If the 
Supreme Court does invalidate the 
ACA, nearly 20 million Americans will 
lose their coverage. 
At a time when we are confronting a 
public health emergency because of the 
coronavirus, a pandemic, we should be 
looking for ways to bolster healthcare 
coverage and protect community clin-
ics and healthcare providers, not tear 
it away from El Pasoans and other 
communities around the Nation that 
need it the most. 
ENSURING DEMAND FOR U.S. 
ENERGY 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, with 
Saudi Arabia and Russia going through 
absurd measures to drive the United 
States out of the energy market, this 
is a prime opportunity to ensure we 
have demand for American energy 
made right here at home. 
That is why I am saddened to see 
Pennsylvania’s Governor publicly op-
pose legislation that will incentivize 
the potential creation of two new pe-
trochemical facilities in Pennsylvania. 
The United States, generally, and 
Pennsylvania, in particular, have bene-
fited from homegrown energy produc-
tion. The natural gas industry in Penn-
sylvania has invested in local commu-
nities, improved educational opportu-
nities, lowered energy costs, and boost-
ed our national security through en-
ergy independence. 
But we cannot allow foreign coun-
tries, especially those who do not share 
our values, to drive us out of the en-
ergy market. 
By supporting an energy and fer-
tilizer manufacturing tax credit, and 
bringing jobs, investment, and local de-
mand for local gas, Pennsylvania could 
invest in our country’s future and our 
national security by ensuring a local 
market for local energy resources.

b 1615 
RESTORING THE VOICES OF THE 
AMERICAN PEOPLE 
(Mr. SARBANES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, 1 
year ago, almost to the day, this House 
of Representatives passed H.R. 1, the 
For the People Act, a transformative 
anticorruption and clean elections bill 
that would give people their voice back 
in their own democracy. 
It would fix gerrymandering; it would 
fix voting; it would fix ethics; it would 
protect the ballot box; it would push 
back against foreign interference and 
foreign disinformation coming into our 
campaigns; and it would lift up the 
voices of average Americans in com-
peting with big money and lobbyists 
here in Washington. 
It would change the status quo so 
every American would feel that their 
voice counts here, that their opinion 
matters, and that that is how we make 
policy. 
Unfortunately, 
MITCH
MCCONNELL, 
the majority leader in the United 
States Senate, has refused to bring 
H.R. 1 to the floor of the United States 
Senate. One whole year of folding his 
arms at the gates of our democracy and 
saying to the American people: You 
shall not pass. 
Madam Speaker, we are not going to 
be deterred; we are not going be to be 
diverted; and we are not going to be de-
feated. We are going to keep pressing 
on to pass H.R. 1 for the people and re-
store the voices of the American peo-
ple. 
f 
REMEMBERING DOROTHY MAE 
BURNS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Ms. Dorothy Burns, who passed 
away on Sunday, February 16, at the 
age of 84. 
Throughout her life, Ms. Burns was a 
trailblazing woman who was heavily 
involved in Georgia government, advo-
cating for candidates she thought were 
best for our State. 
Within the State, she served as the 
very first vice chair of the Georgia Re-
publican Party. Ms. Burns held leader-
ship roles on countless successful cam-
paigns, 
including 
Georgia 
Senators 
JOHNNY ISAKSON, Mack Mattingly, and 
Paul Coverdell and Presidents Ronald 
Reagan and George H.W. Bush. Addi-
tionally, she served numerous times as 
a delegate to national political conven-
tions and as a Presidential elector. 
But her dedication did not stop with 
politics. In Gainesville, Georgia, Ms. 
Burns taught the speech and hearing 
impaired how to read braille. She 
founded the K–12 school, Lakeview 
Academy, which continues to thrive 
today. 
Ms. Burns is leaving our State much 
better than she found it and will be 
deeply missed. Her family and friends 
are in my thoughts and prayers during 
this most difficult time.

HONORING THE WEST ORANGE 
HIGH SCHOOL CHEERLEADERS 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I want 
to congratulate, again, some excep-
tional young people from my district, 
the cheerleaders from West Orange 
High School. Known as the Mountain-
eers, they fought their way to the 2020 
Universal Cheerleading Association’s 
National Cheerleading Championships 
in Orlando, Florida. They survived a 
tough regional in Pennsylvania to get 
there. 
In Orlando, they faced the best high 
school cheerleading squads in the coun-
try. During their first UCA competi-
tion, they won their semifinal for the 
large varsity non-tumbling division 
and earned a trip to the finals. 
Before they left, I said to them I 
hoped that they would bring the trophy 
home to West Orange, and that is ex-
actly what they did. The Mountaineers 
earned a trophy for finishing eighth 
out of 32 squads, and I am extremely 
proud of them. They may not have

CONGRATULATING MARK 
MEADOWS 
(Mr. SPANO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SPANO. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to congratulate my friend, col-
league, 
and 
fellow 
Brandon 
High 
School 
alum, 
Congressman 
MARK 
MEADOWS, on his appointment to be the 
next White House Chief of Staff. 
Like myself, Congressman MEADOWS 
grew up in Brandon, Florida, and also, 
like me, spent time at Florida State 
University and also is an alum of the 
University of South Florida. Go Bulls. 
As a longtime Representative from 
North Carolina, he has boldly served 
his State and country with pride and 
honor. There is no doubt that his con-
stituents have been fortunate to have 
him as their voice in Congress. 
His legacy will be one of relentlessly 
fighting for the American people and 
the American Dream while working 
tirelessly to pass and strengthen con-
servative policies. 
Representative MEADOWS’ resilience, 
passion, humor, and patriotism will be 
missed in committee hearings and on 
the House floor. However, I am con-
fident that he will continue to display 
the same character and fight for these 
same values at the White House and al-
ways provide our President his best 
counsel. 
Again, congratulations on your new 
position, Mark. I know you will con-
tinue to make our Nation proud.

EFFECTIVE APPRENTICESHIPS 
FOR VETERANS 
(Ms. SLOTKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Support for 
Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships 
Act. I am so proud to be coleading this 
bipartisan bill with Representative 
CLARK, and I want to, in particular, 
thank Senator GARY PETERS from the 
great State of Michigan for his leader-
ship in driving this legislation through 
the Senate. 
When we make the decision to send 
men and women to fight for our coun-
try, we make that decision to support 
them for the rest of their lives. That 
means veterans should have every op-
portunity to enroll in an apprentice-
ship that connects them with good- 
paying jobs. 
The bill before us today expands the 
number of programs veterans can ac-
cess with their GI benefits. GI benefits 
can cover things like housing and liv-
ing expenses when they are going 
through their apprenticeship. 
This bill came straight from concerns 
raised by veterans in the district. In 
particular, I want to thank Rick Dono-
van, a veteran from Oakland County, 
who brought this idea to our attention. 
Just last month, I visited Lansing 
Community 
College 
with 
Senator 
PETERS, which has some amazing ap-
prenticeship programs. 
This bill has already passed the Sen-
ate with bipartisan support. It is a 
great example of what can happen 
when we work together on issues that 
matter to all of us across Chambers 
and across parties. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of this bill 
and send it to the President’s desk.

RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNUAL 
WOMEN BUILD EVENT 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to honor the 10th annual 
Women Build event held by the Salem 
County Habitat for Humanity. The 
event and the building took place in 
Penns Grove, south Jersey. The three 
homes that were built in Penns Grove 
will be dedicated on March 30 of this 
year. 
Across the country and around the 
world, about 6,000 women will unite in 
more than 235 communities to build 
and improve 540 homes. The Women 
Build event also raises awareness about 
housing issues facing women and facing 
their families. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of the 
volunteers who helped at the event. 
They are changing lives for the better 
and making our community thrive. I 
thank them for what they do. 
I would specifically like to recognize 
Stephanie Williams. Stephanie has put 
her tools to great use to help families 
in her community. 
It inspires me to see such great work 
happening in our own backyard, and I 
thank them for all of their dedicated 
service, their kind hearts, and their 
hard work in changing the lives of 
those who are very much in need.

NATIONAL WOMEN AND GIRLS 
HIV/AIDS AWARENESS DAY 
(Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam 
Speaker, today is National Women and 
Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. 
In the United States, 235,000 women 
and girls are living with HIV, and they 
make up one in four new diagnoses, 
with Hispanic and African-American 
women disproportionately impacted. 
Although, nationwide, new HIV cases 
are declining, in Miami-Dade County 
they are, sadly, on the rise, making 
today so important for my district. 
Let’s remember, also, that this dis-
ease yet has no cure. Awareness is crit-
ical to reduce transmission. Knowing 
your status is crucial. 
But the reality is that one in nine 
women with HIV are unaware that they 
have it. That is why testing and pre-
ventive medication like PrEP need to 
be accessible and affordable. We must 
also be aware that some women living 
with HIV postpone care because of 
fears of rejection by loved ones or vio-
lence from a partner. 
It is on us to do our part to spread 
awareness, reduce stigma, and support 
women and girls living with HIV and 
AIDS.

CONGRATULATING JILLIAN 
LARRABEE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Jillian Larrabee 
from Durham High School in northern 
California for winning the giant slalom 
race 
during 
the 
California-Nevada 
Interscholastic 
Ski 
and 
Snowboard 
Federation championships. 
As a resident of Durham, Jillian lived 
on her family’s farm during the week 
and drove to Lake Tahoe on the week-
ends to train and pursue her dream of 
professional skiing. 
Her high school never had a ski and 
snowboard team, so Jillian petitioned 
the Durham Unified School Board in 
hopes of bringing a team to her school. 
Earlier this year, the board approved 
her request for the 2020 season. 
Jillian was the lone competitor to 
make the championship from Durham 
High during their inaugural year. She 
finished her first run in 1 minute and 13 
seconds and then narrowed that time 
by clocking a run of 1 minute and 9.6 
seconds, which finished a full second 
faster than the second-place skier in 
the giant slalom. 
As a result of her outstanding per-
formance, Jillian was named to the all- 
State team, the only member from the 
Butte County area. 
From hard work and persistence 
comes great success for her and her 
school. Congratulations, Jillian.

CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I have always said that the role of the 
Federal Government is an umbrella on 
a rainy or stormy day. The Nation now 
faces the storm of coronavirus, and we 
should be the umbrella and be prepared 
and not panic. It is imperative that we 
provide widespread information on just 
the basics of how Americans can care 
for themselves. 
I have organized a bipartisan task 
force on the coronavirus that includes

an opportunity for Members to talk 
about the issues within their congres-
sional districts and try to ensure that 
the American people are well taken 
care of. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
administration 
got a very slow start. In a hearing that 
we just had, one State had the ability 
to test only 472 people; another State 
had the ability to test only 350. Obvi-
ously, we need to be able to ramp up 
the number of test kits to help the 
American people, and we need the 
equipment to protect our medical pro-
fessionals. 
Madam Speaker, I end by saying, as 
hospitals face a crisis and clinics face a 
crisis, the American people must look 
to the Federal Government to do their 
job correctly.

SUPPORTING 
JUSTICE 
FOR 
VIC-
TIMS OF SANCTUARY CITIES ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I would 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks, to in-
clude extraneous materials on the 
topic of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I am 
joined by my colleagues today to dis-
cuss 
how 
sanctuary 
city 
policies 
threaten the safety of American citi-
zens. 
Before I dive in, I want to commend 
the 
Trump 
administration 
for 
its 
crack-down on sanctuary cities, and I 
applaud the recent Second Circuit 
Court of Appeals’ decision allowing the 
Department of Justice to withhold 
funding from sanctuary cities. 
Now, back in June, Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement released a list of 
criminal illegal aliens that were al-
lowed back into their sanctuary com-
munities by local officials. One such 
criminal is Rosalio Ramos-Ramos, he 
is a Honduran citizen who was deported 
four times before authorities arrested 
him in Washington State in October of 
2017. 
Once notified of Rosalio’s arrest, ICE 
issued a written detainer request, ask-
ing the local authorities to imprison 
him for an additional 48 hours so that 
they could decide whether or not to 
begin deportation proceedings. 
Instead, local authorities ignored the 
detainer request and released Rosalio 
back into the community. In January 
of 2018, he murdered his cousin, and 
then he hid the body in a dumpster. 
In another instance, in 2015, Garcia 
Zarate, an illegal immigrant from Mex-
ico shot and killed 32-year-old Kate 
Steinle, a very well-known case, and a 
tragedy, while she was walking with 
her father and her friend on Pier 14 in 
San Francisco. 
Prior to the shooting, Garcia Zarate 
had been deported five times, and was 
supposed to be deported for a sixth 
time. He had been transferred to San 
Francisco’s jail to serve a sentence for 
selling marijuana, but local authorities 
released him a few days later, despite a 
detainer request from Federal law en-
forcement. 
Situations like these are more com-
mon than they should be in our coun-
try, and many local officials protect il-
legal immigrants and ignore Federal 
immigration laws up to the point of 
leaving dangerous individuals in their 
communities. 
As you can see from these horrific ex-
amples, refusing to honor detainer re-
quests and frustrating local law en-
forcement has dire consequences. Not 
only does it make our Nation less safe, 
it leaves no room for the victims of 
these offenders to obtain justice. 
That is why I introduced the Justice 
for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act, 
along with my colleague, Representa-
tive BRADLEY
BYRNE, here in the 
House, and my fellow North Carolinian, 
THOM TILLIS, over in the Senate. 
This legislation would allow anyone 
who is a victim of murder, rape, or any 
felony, to file a lawsuit and bring civil 
action against the State or the sanc-
tuary city if that city failed to honor a 
lawful immigration detainer request 
from the Department of Homeland Se-
curity. Any individual who is injured 
or harmed by an illegal immigrant, 
who benefited from a sanctuary city’s 
policy, will be able to sue the sanc-
tuary city or State. 
My bill also requires sanctuary cities 
to waive a criminal’s immunity as a 
condition of receiving certain Federal 
grants. If the jurisdiction doesn’t agree 
to waive immunity, it will not be eligi-
ble for grants for public works, grant 
planning, and administrative expenses, 
and grants for training, research, and 
technical assistance. 
I am extremely proud that President 
Trump endorsed our bill during his 2020 
State of the Union address. It is time 
for Congress to force sanctuary cities 
to comply with Federal law enforce-
ment, and to stop them from letting 
dangerous criminals remain on our 
streets. It is finally time to give vic-
tims of sanctuary city policies a legal 
pathway to justice. 
During my trip to the southern bor-
der last year, I witnessed the humani-
tarian and security crisis up close and 
personal. I saw the sorry state of some 
areas of our border. I saw places that 
were only defended by thin, barbed- 
wire fences. These weak defenses allow 
practically anyone to break into our 
country, and that includes dangerous 
members of drug cartels who fuel our 
country’s devastating opioid crisis. 
I will continue to support policies 
that crack down on sanctuary cities 
across the United States. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I yield to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. NORMAN), my dear friend, someone 
who has been a staunch advocate for 
securing our border. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BUDD, and I appre-
ciate this bill. 
I rise in strong support of the Justice 
for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act. It 
is high time the United States Con-
gress address the dangers of sanctuary 
city policies. 
I think it comes at a very important 
time, as we are suffering or could suffer 
from a pandemic that we are facing. To 
have open borders and let anybody in 
doesn’t make sense now, nor does it 
make sense in the future. I commend 
my colleagues, Representatives TED 
BUDD and BRADLEY BYRNE, for their 
leadership in holding sanctuary cities 
accountable to the law. 
Make no mistake, sanctuary cities 
kill by offering safe havens to some of 
the most violent and reckless crimi-
nals residing in this country. Sanc-
tuary cities put American lives at risk 
every single day. 
Only a few months ago, an illegal 
alien, Nemias Perez-Severiano killed a 
67-year-old Vietnam war veteran, U.S. 
Marine, Samuel W. Jackson, inside a 
sanctuary county in Pennsylvania. 
Jackson risked his life to defend a 
country that now refuses to protect his 
life. Counties like Montgomery in 
Pennsylvania are an insult to patriots 
like Jackson. 
My district has no sanctuary cities, 
but that does not guarantee our safety. 
In Lancaster, South Carolina, just a 
few miles from where I live, Charlie 
Byrdic, an innocent and law-abiding 
citizen, was killed by an illegal immi-
grant who had hidden from authorities 
for years. Without the cooperation of 
sanctuary cities with law enforcement 
agencies, more families will lose their 
loved ones because criminals are al-
lowed to roam our Nation without con-
sequences. That is why we need this 
legislation. 
This bill will offer a measure of jus-
tice to the victims of those violent 
crimes by allowing victims and their 
families to sue the cities that house 
these assailants. 
Enough is enough. No American 
should lose his or her life, liberty, or 
property, because the government re-
fuses to act against known criminals, 
immigrants or not. 
The choice is ours; do we want to be 
the kind of country that protects the 
victims of crime or the perpetrators of 
crime? I know where I stand. It is time 
to fight against this thing that is 
plaguing our country of opening up our 
borders to anyone. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. NORMAN. 
Madam Speaker, at this point, I 
would yield to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. BYRNE), a friend and col-
league who led the effort with me to in-
troduce the Justice for Victims of 
Sanctuary Cities Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1582 
March 10, 2020 
Like all of us here tonight, he is tired 
of hearing stories about illegal immi-
grants in sanctuary cities committing 
horrific crimes against American citi-
zens. I want to thank him for spear-
heading the effort against this dan-
gerous sanctuary city policy. 
Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, when 
our Founding Fathers began this great 
experiment called the United States of 
America, they did so with the fresh but 
unpleasant memories of a tyrannical 
and repressive monarchy. They set out 
to create a new system of government 
that served American citizens, while 
ensuring their rights and liberties and 
protecting the powers of the individual 
States. 
To protect this system of Federalism, 
certain powers were required to be 
vested with the Federal Government. 
In our Constitution, our Founders 
gave, or enumerated in their language, 
specific powers to our Federal Govern-
ment necessary to provide for a com-
mon defense, establish the rules for 
naturalizing new citizens, and ensure 
the integrity of our international bor-
ders. Controlling immigration into our 
country is essential for the rule of law. 
The integrity of our system requires a 
cooperation, though sometimes a tense 
one, between the Federal and lower 
governments. 
Sadly, a growing movement across 
many cities and jurisdictions has un-
dermined our constitutional order and 
the rule of law which protects it. The 
result of these dangerous and mis-
guided policies is so-called sanctuary 
cities. 
These sanctuary cities do not cooper-
ate, and even undermine, Federal law 
enforcement from apprehending crimi-
nal aliens. The irony is that sanctuary 
cities become more unsafe and inhos-
pitable 
to 
law-abiding 
Americans, 
those my colleagues and I have sworn a 
duty to protect. 
These reckless policies are a danger 
not just to people in sanctuary cities 
but beyond. When dangerous criminals 
are allowed quarter in one location, it 
is only a matter of time before they 
move to another location to continue 
their criminal activity. Sadly, many 
American citizens have been victim-
ized, even murdered. 
That is why last year Congressman 
BUDD and I introduced the Justice for 
Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act. Our 
bill will provide for individuals to sue 
sanctuary cities and jurisdictions if 
they are harmed in a violent crime 
committed by an illegal immigrant. If 
jurisdictions refuse to be sued, they 
will lose out on Federal grant money. 
As President Trump said about our 
bill, it will ‘‘give American victims the 
right to sue sanctuary cities and hold 
them accountable for the thousands of 
lives they have shattered.’’ This will 
disincentivize sanctuary policies that 
fuel even more illegal immigration and 
harm the safety and security of Ameri-
cans. 
I have been to our southern border. I 
have spoken directly with ICE, CBP, 
and other law enforcement agents 
there, the crisis is real. 
We have thousands of miles of border 
and coastline. Border security cannot 
stop at the border. Those who manage 
to sneak in, especially those with 
criminal histories, cannot be given a 
free pass once they make it across. 
Sanctuary cities that undermine our 
laws must be held accountable. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues for joining with me today to 
speak out on this problem and call for 
action on the Justice for Victims of 
Sanctuary Cities Act. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. BYRNE for his friendship and lead-
ership on this. 
Madam Speaker, at this point, I 
would like to yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
I want to thank him for his leader-
ship on the Immigration Detainer En-
forcement Act. This bill makes it easi-
er for local law enforcement to comply 
with lawful detainer requests from the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
I also want to thank him for his 
steadfast leadership on the Committee 
for Homeland Security. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend and 
fellow North Carolinian, Mr. BUDD. 
From San Francisco to my district in 
Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 
cities across the country are declaring 
themselves sanctuary cities. The term 
sounds peaceful, but the results are ex-
actly the opposite. 
For example, North Carolina sheriffs 
in a few urban counties released over 
500 illegal aliens last year, who were 
convicted or accused of serious crimes, 
including domestic violence, indecency 
with a child, even rape, and murder. 
Rather than hand over these vicious 
criminals to the Federal authorities, 
sanctuary cities and counties release 
them into your community to prey on 
you and your family. 
What is the purpose of this policy? 
Clearly, it is not public safety. Nor is it 
for the protection of immigrant com-
munities; indeed, they are the most 
victimized by these predators. Rather, 
it is meant to serve a national liberal 
agenda that prizes open borders over 
community safety. 
Across the Nation, we were horrified 
to learn last year about a 92-year-old 
woman brutally raped and murdered at 
the hands of an individual who should 
have never been released—whom ICE 
asked to hold. 
So, the increasing breakdown in the 
relationship between Federal and local 
authorities isn’t just theoretically dan-
gerous. 
Further, sanctuary policies put dedi-
cated law enforcement officers at risk. 
When criminals are released, despite an 
ICE detainer, ICE has a statutory re-
sponsibility to collect them. Rather 
than have a secure transfer, ICE must 
go into the community to track down 
the individual for an uncontrolled ar-
rest. 
Ironically, if the situation turns vio-
lent, the very local police who arrested 
the alien the first time will be there to 
back up ICE. 
To hold these jurisdictions to ac-
count, I was proud to sign on to the 
Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities 
Act, which would allow victims of 
crimes committed by individuals re-
leased under sanctuary city policies, or 
their survivors, to sue sanctuary juris-
dictions. 
For example, in the New York City 
case, the woman’s family would be able 
to sue the local government for allow-
ing the release of her killer, who 
should have been safely in ICE custody. 
Often, cities and towns claim immu-
nity from being sued like this, denying 
victims’ rights. This bill would allow 
communities to maintain that prac-
tice, but not at the expense of Amer-
ican taxpayers. 
I have heard across the aisle that 
sanctuary cities only release individ-
uals who pose no community harm. If 
you believe that, you should have no 
issue with this bill because those who 
are released won’t endanger the com-
munity, and no one would ever be en-
abled to sue. 
I, however, believe we must take this 
threat seriously and impose concrete 
costs to communities who refuse to fol-
low the law. 
I am proud to support this bill intro-
duced 
by 
my 
friend, 
Congressman 
BUDD, and urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
b 1645 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
BABIN). I thank Mr. BABIN for his lead-
ership as co-chair of the House Border 
Security Caucus and for fighting to 
make America safe. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. BUDD for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary 
Cities Act introduced by my good 
friend from North Carolina, Represent-
ative TED BUDD. 
Since we are supposed to be a Nation 
of laws, this is a bill that really should 
not have even needed to have been 
written. But sadly, because of the reck-
lessness and lunacy of sanctuary cities, 
States, and jurisdictions run by rogue 
local officials, we have to fight tooth 
and nail just to enforce our laws and to 
put the safety of our citizens first. 
The Democrats baselessly like to 
shout that the President is not above 
the law, yet they praise sanctuary ju-
risdictions for doing exactly what they 
claim to fight against. Apparently, 
being in direct opposition to the rule of 
law is okay as long as you are doing it 
under the name of sanctuary. 
Earlier this year, we witnessed a vio-

possession of a weapon. This is who 
New York chose to protect under its 
sanctuary policies rather than Maria 
Fuertes. 
The worst part is that this tragedy 
could have been prevented. It is quite 
simple: If Governor Cuomo had allowed 
this 
monster 
to 
be 
deported, 
he 
wouldn’t have been able to do this to 
Mrs. Fuertes. 
Frighteningly, this is not an isolated 
incident. This is happening every sin-
gle day across America, and nobody is 
being held accountable for it. These 
policies not only pose a great risk to 
the safety and wellbeing of Americans 
but also to the sovereignty of our great 
Nation. 
Do my colleagues on the left not care 
that the drug cartels control those who 
illegally cross our borders and that 
they are abusing our laws for profit? 
Do they not care that these same 
cartels are allowing women and chil-
dren to be violated and abused on their 
journey up to the United States? 
Do they not care that thousands of 
Americans have been assaulted, in-
jured, raped, or—worse—killed by ille-
gal 
aliens, 
all 
being 
preventable 
crimes? 
Facts are stubborn things, as Presi-
dent Reagan used to say. Unfortu-
nately, Washington Democrats don’t 
seem to care about the facts. They are 
happy to trade them for political ad-
vantage through emotion—in violation 
of our Nation’s laws. 
I stand with President Trump and my 
colleagues here today in the effort to 
end these criminal hotbeds. 
At the end of the day, this isn’t about 
statistics; it is about people. It is time 
that we stood up for the American peo-
ple who have suffered at the hands of 
those who shouldn’t even be here in the 
first place. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
ALLEN). I appreciate his steadfast lead-
ership on highlighting the danger that 
sanctuary cities pose to cities across 
America. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
Congressman TED BUDD for calling this 
Special Order and for introducing the 
Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities 
Act. 
One of my top priorities is to secure 
our border and restore the rule of law 
in our immigration system. We are one 
of the most blessed nations on the face 
of the Earth, and we have one of the 
best and most generous legal immigra-
tion systems out there. 
We allow more than a million people 
to come through the system legally 
each year. On top of that, we have al-
most a million students here on stu-
dent visas, studying in our colleges and 
universities. 
We are a Nation of laws, and just as 
every American citizen is held ac-
countable under the law for the crimes 
they commit, so should every alien 
who comes across that border illegally. 
That is why I am proud to be a cospon-
sor of the Justice for Victims of Sanc-
tuary Cities Act. 
This bill holds illegal aliens in sanc-
tuary cities accountable for the hei-
nous crimes they commit on American 
soil. Specifically, this bill allows vic-
tims to sue the sanctuary city where 
the crime took place. 
It is alarming that we shield illegal 
aliens from the consequences of vio-
lating Federal law, yet an American 
citizen who commits a crime is held ac-
countable under the law. This must 
end, and we must give the victims of 
these horrific crimes the justice they 
deserve. 
To further end the harmful practices 
of sanctuary cities, I am also a proud 
cosponsor of the Ending Sanctuary Cit-
ies Act. This bill prohibits Federal 
grant funding to any city or county 
that violates Federal immigration law. 
I am proud to support two critical 
bills that take steps toward preventing 
future violent and unprovoked crimes 
by illegal immigrants. 
I thank President Trump for his lead-
ership in fighting against the cruelty 
of sanctuary cities by stating his sup-
port for the Justice for Victims of 
Sanctuary Cities Act during his State 
of the Union Address. 
This should not be a partisan issue, 
as no one is above the law. 
I stand with my colleagues and Presi-
dent Trump. We must fix our broken 
immigration system, continue building 
the wall, and strengthen our immigra-
tion laws for the safety and security of 
the American people. 
I will continue fighting against sanc-
tuary cities and their abuse of our 
great Nation. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. WIL-
LIAMS), a great capitalist and a great 
baseball coach. 
Mr. WILLIAMS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The greatest commitment I make to 
my constituents in Texas’ 25th District 
is to keep them and their families safe. 
Unfortunately, some State and local 
governments are choosing to put poli-
tics over public safety by passing sanc-
tuary immigration laws that prevent 
local law enforcement from cooper-
ating with Federal immigration offi-
cers. 
Sanctuary laws not only release dan-
gerous criminals back onto our streets, 
but they also are a slap in the face to 
the millions of immigrants who went 
through the legal process to enter the 
United States and comply with our 
laws. 
I believe that individuals who enter 
our country illegally should never be 
afforded the same privileges as law- 
abiding Texans. 
I support President Trump’s decisive 
and necessary actions to withhold Fed-
eral grants from sanctuary jurisdic-
tions that proactively make immigra-
tion officers’ jobs more challenging by 
refusing to follow the law. 
Congress must take additional action 
to follow in the footsteps of the Trump 
administration. For that reason, today, 
I am proud to speak in support of the 
Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities 
Act. 
This important bill holds State and 
local governments accountable if they 
choose to put the public at risk by not 
following immigration laws. It allows 
for the victims to sue sanctuary juris-
dictions if a crime was committed by 
an individual who was released back 
into the public instead of being turned 
over to Federal immigration enforce-
ment officers. 
A report by the Texas Department of 
Public Safety found that 214,000 illegal 
aliens were charged with over 340,000 
crimes between 2011 and February 2020. 
Many were serious offenses that put 
the public at risk. There were over 600 
homicides, 37,000 assaults, and 3,400 
weapons charges, just to name a few. 
The victims of these crimes deserve 
to have an avenue to fight back against 
sanctuary policies. This bill would 
force State and local governments to 
choose whether they will change their 
dangerous policies and get in line with 
Federal immigration laws or risk being 
sued when there is a serious crime 
committed by an illegal immigrant. 
The Justice for Victims of Sanctuary 
Cities Act is the first step to holding 
rogue State and local governments ac-
countable for exploiting our broken 
immigration system. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to put the safety of their con-
stituents first by supporting our efforts 
to get this bill across the finish line. 
In God we trust. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. 
WATKINS). I appreciate his support on 
this bill. 
Mr. WATKINS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
also for his leadership. 
I rise today in support of the Justice 
for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act. 
In June of last year, ICE released a 
list of criminal illegal aliens that were 
allowed back into their sanctuary com-
munities by local officials. One was de-
ported four times before being arrested. 
How common is it for a criminal ille-
gal alien released by the sanctuary ju-
risdiction to go on and commit further 
crimes? It is 40 to 80 percent. 
This is so wrong. We are a people of 
laws. This is unacceptable. 
My own district, the community of 
Lawrence, 
Kansas, 
is 
considering 
adopting a sanctuary city policy. 
Quite simply, these policies put our 
communities at risk. The Justice for 
Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act would 
help victims of murder, rape, and all 
other sorts of felonies. 
I stand with those victims. I stand 
with the President. I stand with my 
colleagues. I stand for all law-abiding 
citizens. And I stand for justice. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
STEUBE). I thank the gentleman for his 
history of being a strong proponent of 
Federal immigration enforcement at

the State level and for his time in the 
Florida Legislature, and I appreciate 
his support here, as well. 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. BUDD for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to 
have the opportunity to stand for jus-
tice with the victims of sanctuary cit-
ies. 
It is completely offensive to me as an 
American that we have cities and, in 
some cases, entire States declaring 
themselves sanctuaries for illegal im-
migrants who are mercilessly commit-
ting crimes in our Nation. 
American 
citizens 
are 
being 
as-
saulted, raped, and murdered at the 
hands of illegal immigrants who should 
have been deported by ICE, but due to 
the blatant disregard of Federal law, 
cities are giving sanctuary to criminals 
and rapists while actual American citi-
zens can do absolutely nothing about 
it. 
Just last year, two illegal immi-
grants committed a horrific gang-re-
lated murder in the Seattle area. One 
took a baseball bat to the head and 
body of a high school student, killing 
him. Another took a machete to the 
teen, chopping off an arm and a leg and 
hacking at his neck. 
This followed another gang-related 
murder in King County, Washington, 
that also involved an illegal immigrant 
that local authorities refused to turn 
over to ICE for deportation. 
In the wake of the killings, King 
County officials have defended their 
policies and complained that ICE is 
harassing the county. Apparently, offi-
cials in King County, Washington, 
would rather have Americans be mur-
dered by machete-wielding illegal im-
migrants than deport noncitizens who 
pose a risk to those who actually call 
America home. 
Ken Cuccinelli, Acting Deputy Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, stated at 
the time: ‘‘You’re talking about lit-
erally crimes that never should have 
happened 
in 
this 
country 
because 
they’re people who, upon their first 
interaction with the justice system, 
should have been deported.’’ 
Therefore, if cities are going to bla-
tantly ignore the law of the land and 
provide sanctuary to illegal immi-
grants that commit crimes in our 
country, then those cities should be 
held financially accountable to the 
families of the victims, and those cities 
should be stripped of Federal funding 
until they comply with Federal law. 
I will take a step further. It should 
be a criminal offense for elected offi-
cials to blatantly ignore Federal immi-
gration law, and they should be held 
accountable for denying ICE the ability 
to protect our country. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to 
support this important legislation. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LAMALFA), a great friend of mine and a 
hardworking Member. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. BUDD for yielding and for 
working on this issue even though he is 
not from a State that has as much of it 
as California. 
Indeed, I have seen so much happen 
to my population at home that many 
are giving up for a host of reasons, but 
this is one right near the top of the list 
for leaving our State, to go to others 
that don’t have sanctuary cities or 
sanctuary State policies. 
If you go back in time, what really 
was at the front of this issue that put 
it on a lot of people’s radar around the 
country was the Kate Steinle tragedy 
that happened in San Francisco. An il-
legal immigrant was here, having been 
deported many times over, and still 
had this opportunity for whatever the 
circumstances that took the life of 
Kate Steinle. 
Time and time again, in my home 
State, people are fed up. I had a chance 
to sit down with some members of ICE 
here the other day. They are just try-
ing to do their job. They are just try-
ing to uphold the law. 
Indeed, what some of my colleagues 
have talked about here this evening is 
that we have people actually causing 
the law to be broken that are elected 
officials—people that swore an oath to 
the Constitution, to the laws of this 
country, and to my home State—now 
causing one of the worst things: an in-
crease of crime you can see in Cali-
fornia. 
b 1700 
The exodus from California comes 
from the root cause of things like not 
only the high cost of doing business 
but the crime wave that is hitting Cali-
fornia, and that is rooted in this sanc-
tuary city, illegal immigration, and 
the things that they cause to make our 
communities less safe. 
So, at this point, I am proud to be 
able to join in this bill that Mr. BUDD 
is bringing. 
We need to have sanctions against 
States and cities and, as Mr. STEUBE 
talked about, hold accountable the 
public officials that are causing their 
own cities, their own jurisdictions, to 
be defying the law. 
How are we supposed to teach our 
kids or anybody that the law has value 
when we have people making it a con-
test to see how much they can defy the 
Trump administration and the law 
itself? 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate this 
time tonight and Mr. BUDD’s effort on 
this. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. LAMALFA, and I appreciate his 
thoughts. 
Madam Speaker, at this time, I yield 
to someone who is focused on securing 
our border, making sure as well that 
West Virginia remains a great place to 
live, work, and raise a family, almost 
heaven, if you will. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. 
MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I 
would first like to thank my colleague 
from North Carolina (Mr. BUDD) for his 
leadership on this important issue. 
We still have a crisis on our southern 
border. While we have made progress, 
we need to finish the job. 
We are continuing to construct our 
border wall, to strengthen our ports of 
entry, and to keep drugs and crime out 
of our communities. Yet, while Presi-
dent Trump, the heads of our Federal 
agencies, and congressional Repub-
licans have joined together to draft 
good legislation and enforce our coun-
try’s laws, we, sadly, have areas in our 
country that harbor criminals under 
the hypocritical title of sanctuary cit-
ies. 
In defiance of our laws, many places 
like San Francisco, Los Angeles, New 
York City, and others have publicly 
pledged to serve as a safe haven for the 
dangerous criminals living in the shad-
ows of our society. 
Meaningful immigration reform is 
crucial, but removing dangerous crimi-
nals cannot wait. Crime affects every 
person in this country—every citizen, 
every visitor, every single person, 
whether of legal status or otherwise. 
We have seen that anybody can be a 
victim of crime when our city leaders 
refuse to remove violent offenders off 
our streets. 
These city officials have provided 
sanctuaries for lawbreakers but not for 
law followers. We need justice for those 
victims. 
While city leaders protect criminals 
from deportation and frustrate our 
Federal immigration enforcers, it is 
well past time to create a pathway to 
justice for the law-abiding members of 
our communities. 
If these sanctuary city officials will 
not protect their citizens, they must 
pay a price. They must be held ac-
countable and responsible for their 
reckless negligence. 
We need to allow victims and their 
families to sue these cities that have 
blocked our Federal agents from en-
forcing laws and shielded violent crimi-
nals from removal. President Trump 
spoke of this in his eloquent and pow-
erful State of the Union Message. 
I am proud to cosponsor the Justice 
for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act in-
troduced by Mr. BUDD because my fel-
low West Virginians and many Ameri-
cans know that this is the right thing 
for our country. 
Good governance depends on trans-
parency and accountability for our 
citizens and cooperation between Fed-
eral, State, and local leaders. Sanc-
tuary cities deny these. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mrs. MILLER for being here tonight. I 
appreciate her support on this. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of my 
colleagues who have made it tonight to 
speak on the dangers that sanctuary 
cities pose to the communities around 
us. 
It strikes me as common sense to 
pursue legislation that allows families 
and victims legal recourse against the 
municipalities and policies that have 
caused them so much damage.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MARCH 10, 2020 
No. 46 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Senator from South Carolina, 
the Honorable TIM SCOTT, offered the 
following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Dear Heavenly Father, teach us rev-
erential awe. Give us the respect for 
You and Your purposes that You are 
due. Bless our leaders. Keep them from 
evil as You lead them to make a posi-
tive impact on our Nation and world. 
Lord, rescue them from the inevi-
table troubles of life, protecting them 
from harm. As they seek to serve You, 
fill them with a faith that will not 
shrink, though oppressed by many foes. 
May they continually rejoice because 
of Your promise that no weapon formed 
against them shall prosper. 
We pray in Your holy Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
IOWA HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as all Iowans know, I love history. 
That brings me to the floor to honor 
March as Iowa History Month. 
Here are some facts about Iowa. 
Since becoming a State in 1846, Iowa 
has raised one President—that is Presi-
dent Hoover—and four Nobel laureates, 
and is home to over 2,000 locations on 
the 
National 
Register 
of 
Historic 
Places. 
Our heritage is preserved by Iowans 
who do their good work through main-
taining Iowa’s museums and historic 
sites. I encourage all of my fellow 
Iowans to help pass on our history to 
the next generation by taking advan-
tage of the many programs hosted this 
month 
by 
visiting 
www.iowaculture.gov. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
yesterday evening, the President, the 
Vice President, and their task force of-
fered an extensive public briefing on 
ongoing efforts to combat this new 
virus, which has spread from China 
throughout the world. 
As the Director of the CDC explained, 
officials are now tracking more than 
500 cases across our country. Nation-
wide, the risk to any individual Amer-
ican remains low, but as the Vice 
President and the experts reminded us, 
the time is now for all Americans to 
engage in basic commonsense measures 
and for Americans at heightened risk 
to take additional precautions. De-
tailed recommendations for individ-
uals, families, and employers are avail-
able online at coronavirus.gov. 
President 
Trump 
also 
announced 
that in parallel with the public health 
response, his administration is consid-
ering ways to mitigate the impact of 
the virus on our economy. Senate Re-
publicans look forward to discussing 
this with Secretary Mnuchin and the 
President’s team so we can all consider 
the best ways to move forward for the 
American people. As our government 
continues to prepare and protect our 
Nation, I would urge all of my col-
leagues, on both sides of the aisle in 
both Chambers, to put reflexive par-
tisanship aside and stay focused on our 
common work to promote the common 
good. This virus does not care—does 
not care—about partisan divisions. 
This disease poses a challenge, no 
question, but our Nation is strong, we 
are well equipped, and we have over-
come far, far greater challenges before. 
As the Vice President put it yesterday, 
‘‘We’re all in this together.’’ 
f 
S. 2657 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, this week, we have 
the opportunity to pass major legisla-
tion to strengthen our domestic en-
ergy. Chairman MURKOWSKI, Senator 
MANCHIN, and the Energy and Natural 
Resources Committee have assembled a 
strong, bipartisan bill. I look forward 
to passing it. 
I was disappointed yesterday when 
the Senate failed to advance the legis-
lation and clear a path toward com-
pleting the bill. The committee’s prod-
uct includes about 50 different bills and 
contributions 
from 
nearly 
three- 
fourths of the Members of this body, 
and contrary to the Democratic lead-
er’s assertions on the floor, I am cer-
tainly not blocking any bipartisan 
amendment. I have stated right here on 
the floor that I hope and anticipate 
that we will vote on amendments this 
week. 
Don’t be fooled by the finger-point-
ing. I am not standing in the way of bi-
partisan amendments. What is really

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1642 
March 10, 2020 
happening is that the Democratic lead-
er is moving the goalposts. There had 
been a bipartisan understanding about 
how to finish this bill, but yesterday 
the 
Democratic 
leader 
decided 
to 
change his tune and demand a vote on 
something outside the scope of the cur-
rent debate. I hope we can get past this 
showmanship, finish this bipartisan 
legislation, and send it to the House so 
we can get it on the President’s desk. 
Let’s don’t squander this real oppor-
tunity. 
Chairman MURKOWSKI’s and Senator 
MANCHIN’s compromise product will 
help our Nation move toward greater 
energy security, energy efficiency, and 
energy 
affordability 
for 
years 
to 
come—new support for energy effi-
ciency efforts, new incentives for inno-
vation, new tools to secure our elec-
trical grid, and new ways to strengthen 
our domestic supply chain for impor-
tant minerals, and on and on and on. 
This Chamber got it right last week 
when it proceeded to the bill by a vote 
of 90 to 4. It hasn’t suddenly become 
controversial 
overnight. 
Everyone 
knows there are plenty of outside 
issues that Senators do not agree on. 
We should let ourselves agree on what 
we do agree on. Let me say that again: 
We should let ourselves agree on what 
we do agree on and complete this legis-
lation this week. 
Let’s keep legislating. Let’s get this 
done. The American people deserve it. 
f 
ELECTION SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
now, on a final matter, this afternoon 
all Senators will have the opportunity 
to attend a briefing on election secu-
rity from administration experts who 
tackle the issue every day. The FBI Di-
rector; the Acting Secretary of Home-
land Security; General Nakasone of the 
NSA and Cyber Command; the Director 
of Counterintelligence at the DNI; and 
a number of other senior leaders will 
come here to the Capitol to discuss this 
critical subject. 
I look forward to hearing more about 
the significant and strong steps the 
Trump administration has taken over 
the past 3 years to secure our democ-
racy and punch back against the real 
and varied foreign efforts to interfere. I 
look forward to hearing more about the 
unprecedented level of coordination 
that has connected nonpartisan Fed-
eral experts in all 50 States, U.S. terri-
tories, thousands of local jurisdictions, 
and private sector leaders to make sure 
the unpreparedness and inaction that 
defined the Obama administration’s 
failures in 2016 was not repeated in 2018 
and will not be repeated in 2020 or be-
yond. 
I look forward to hearing about how 
the record sums of money, hundreds of 
millions of dollars that Congress has 
put aside for direct grants so States 
and local election officials can shore up 
their systems, are making our democ-
racy safer. I expect I will have more to 
say following the briefing. I expect 
many of our colleagues will, but, be-
forehand, I would like to say this: The 
American people have confidence in 
our democracy, as they should. Just 
last month, a survey found that more 
than 70 percent of Americans are con-
fident their State or local government 
will conduct a fair and accurate elec-
tion this November. Let me say this 
again. Just last month, a survey found 
that more than 70 percent of Ameri-
cans are confident their State or local 
government will conduct a fair and ac-
curate election this November, and 
they should be confident about the re-
silience of our institutions. 
Our Nation is strong. The Trump ad-
ministration has made huge strides. 
After 8 years of weakness, this admin-
istration’s foreign policy has made it 
clear to our adversaries that the 
United States of America is not going 
to be pushed around, but the American 
people also know we must remain vigi-
lant. As long as Russia and other na-
tions seek to meddle, we need to be 
ready. 
Election security is critically impor-
tant to our Nation, and it can only be 
handled right if it is handled with good 
faith and bipartisanship. 
When Washington Democrats use this 
particular topic as a platform for de-
monizing the other side or for pushing 
tangential policy proposals, which the 
left had sought many years—many 
years—before 2016, everyone can see 
right 
through 
it. 
It 
only 
signals 
unseriousness. 
So I encourage all my colleagues to 
attend the bipartisan briefing today, 
and then let’s preserve that bipartisan 
spirit and that unity. Let’s focus on 
fighting against foreign interference, 
not fighting each other. 
We should not just snap right back 
into tired, old partisanship. We should 
not let Putin or anyone else bait Amer-
icans into talking down our own de-
mocracy or sowing more fear and dis-
cord among ourselves than other adver-
saries could ever hope to do them-
selves.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 3422 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I understand there is a bill at the desk 
that is due for a second reading. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will read the title of the bill for 
the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3422) to amend title 54, United 
States Code, to establish, fund, and provide 
for the use of amounts in a National Parks 
and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund to 
address the maintenance backlog of the Na-
tional Park Service, the United States Fish 
and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land 
Management, the Forest Service, and the 
Bureau of Indian Education, and to provide 
permanent, dedicated funding for the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. In order to place 
the bill on the calendar under the pro-
visions of rule XIV, I object to further 
proceeding. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bill will be 
placed on the calendar. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
f 
S. 2657 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I get into the remarks, sub-
stance, of coronavirus and H.R. 1, I 
would like to mention that Leader 
MCCONNELL did not give the right story 
when he talked about the Energy bill. 
I would remind people, 13 Democrats 
voted for cloture; 15 Republicans op-
posed cloture. I would remind the lead-
er that it was a Republican, Senator 
KENNEDY, who led the charge to deny 
cloture, and it was well known that 
Democrats simply wanted an amend-
ment on the Kennedy bill—a Repub-
lican amendment—wanted an ability to 
vote. 
Once 
again, 
because 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
does not allow amend-
ments and debate and, instead, just 
adds more items to his legislative 
graveyard, the bill went down. But 13 
Democrats voted for cloture. If he had 
his Republican troops together, he 
might have been able to pass it any-
way. To blame Democrats and say we 
are moving the goalpost is just a total 
misstatement of what happened. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, on 
COVID, as our country continues to ex-
perience the spread of coronavirus, 
COVID–19, the effects are beginning to 
be more acutely felt. First and fore-
most, our hearts go out to the families 
of those who have lost loved ones dur-
ing this illness. Second, our healthcare 
systems are under tremendous stress, 
businesses have been forced to cut 
back, and the virus is already starting 
to take a toll on the economy. As the 
impact of the coronavirus spreads, the 
administration appears to have shifted 
its focus, holding a press conference 
yesterday to talk about measures the 
administration might pursue to calm 
the markets.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1643 
March 10, 2020 
I would remind the White House: By 
far, the best way to ensure economic 
security for the American people is to 
deal directly with the coronavirus 
itself. Again, getting a handle on the 
crisis and addressing the virus itself is 
by far the best way to respond to any 
negative effects on our economy. 
The administration seems to believe 
that the answer to any problem is an-
other tax cut. And no matter what 
they say about it when they put it to-
gether, it always seems to benefit the 
wealthy and the big and powerful cor-
porations. This is a healthcare crisis; it 
demands a healthcare solution. 
To borrow an expression: You must 
treat the disease, not the symptoms. 
Mr. President, do you hear that? You 
must 
treat 
the 
disease—the 
coronavirus—not the symptom, which 
is the result of the coronavirus, which 
is the economy. 
The President wakes up to a problem 
only after it has an effect on Wall 
Street, and his solutions are often 
aimed, misguidedly, only at calming 
the nerves on Wall Street. The real an-
swer in this case is to protect the 
American people, focus on their health 
and 
economic 
security, 
and 
com-
petently respond to the public health 
crisis at our doorstep. 
Speaker PELOSI and I have mentioned 
several actions we could take, from 
paid sick leave for impacted workers to 
unemployment 
insurance, 
food 
and 
housing 
security, 
and 
protections 
against price gouging. But one thing 
the administration must focus on right 
now, above all, is fixing the problems 
we are having with testing. 
The most powerful tool in responding 
to a virus is to know precisely where it 
is and how it is spreading. Because the 
administration took weeks before they 
developed an accurate test and because 
the administration was slow to ramp 
up the number of Americans tested and 
is now having trouble turning around 
the results of those tests at a fast 
enough pace, we are now far behind 
where we ought to be in understanding 
how far the virus has already spread. 
The United States has the best hos-
pitals, doctors, and scientists in the 
world. Yet, currently, we are lagging 
far behind other countries when it 
comes to testing our citizens. We are 
behind the United Kingdom, behind 
France, behind China, behind Switzer-
land, the Netherlands, Israel, Japan, 
and Italy. Every day we read a new 
story in the press about Americans 
having difficulty getting a test for 
coronavirus even though they are dis-
playing symptoms. Our own Health and 
Human Services was unable to say how 
many Americans have been tested. 
It is shocking; it is infuriating. If 
other countries can do this, why can’t 
we? If other countries do it right, why 
can’t we? South Korea, which has far 
more 
prevalent 
amounts 
of 
coronavirus, is already seeing the num-
ber of new reports go down because 
they have done extensive, thorough, 
and accurate testing. 
The result here—why we are not 
doing as well as other countries is a di-
rect result of the colossal failure of 
leadership and planning from this ad-
ministration and this President. One 
word describes the Trump administra-
tion’s response to the coronavirus so 
far: ‘‘Incompetence.’’ 
I know there are hard-working CDC 
scientists and experts trying to help 
the American people. The political ap-
pointees are the ones who don’t seem 
to get it and are putting politics over 
the safety and security of the Amer-
ican people. And it goes right to the 
top. In the midst of a public health cri-
sis—a serious and dangerous public 
health crisis—the President has repeat-
edly pushed unscientific claims about 
the coronavirus, the availability of a 
vaccine, and given bad advice—bad ad-
vice—to Americans who might have 
symptoms. 
If the President would just keep 
quiet, it would be better than what he 
is doing, which is negative. What we 
really need is leadership. More than 
ever, we need the President to drop the 
conspiracy 
theories, 
end 
the 
Panglossian optimism, and the unsci-
entific speculation. Now more than 
ever, we need President Trump to lead 
our government’s response with com-
petence and to be truthful with the 
American people. As I said yesterday, 
we are all rooting for that, but the 
President and his administration must 
take a hard look in the mirror, focus 
on the problem at hand, not the side ef-
fects, and get to work on fixing them. 
f 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
H.R. 1—this past Sunday marked one 
year since the House passed H.R. 1, the 
For the People Act. This bill takes ur-
gent and long overdue steps to renew 
our democracy. It will reverse the cor-
rupting effects of Citizens United. It 
will restore protections for voting. And 
it will take aim at Washington’s cul-
ture of corruption, which has run 
rampant under this administration. 
It could not come at a better time. 
Every election, we see the sweeping 
power of big money. State legislatures 
have found new ways to deny Ameri-
cans, often minorities, access to the 
ballot. Our adversaries—including the 
Russians—work day and night to influ-
ence our elections and sow confusion in 
the public sphere. H.R. 1 would force-
fully and directly address each of these 
issues. But, like every other bill passed 
by the House over the past 2 years, it 
has been buried in Leader MCCONNELL’s 
legislative graveyard. We must move 
it. This bill is about making our de-
mocracy work and giving American 
citizens some faith in the future. 
Republicans, rather than working 
with Democrats to strengthen our de-
mocracy, have stood in the way. They 
have blocked election security legisla-
tion and sanctions to deter foreign ad-
versaries from trying to interfere in 
our democracy. They have enabled 
President Trump’s assault on the sepa-
ration of powers through their silence 
on the President’s many abuses of 
power. Even today, the Republicans are 
putting forward a nominee for the Fed-
eral Election Commission who ex-
pressed doubts regarding the benefits 
of even the most reasonable restric-
tions on campaign spending, including 
disclosure. 
When H.R. 1 first passed the House, 
Leader MCCONNELL called this bill to 
restore voting rights and get money 
out of politics a ‘‘terrible proposal’’ 
and a ‘‘power grab.’’ If Leader MCCON-
NELL thinks that getting big money 
out of politics is a terrible idea, if he 
truly believes making it easier for 
Americans to vote is a power grab by 
Democrats, then God help the Repub-
lican Party and God help this country. 
Democrats will not stop fighting for 
this bill, nor will we ever stop fighting 
to restore the democratic values that 
have guided our Nation for 21⁄2 cen-
turies. In the United States, each per-
son’s vote should have the same weight 
as everyone else’s. That is a hallmark 
of our democracy. A fair and free elec-
tion is the wellspring of our democ-
racy. It is what Americans have died 
for in the battlefields around the 
world, what civil rights activists have 
marched for across the bridges and the 
generations. And though the Repub-
lican leader has been adamant in his 
opposition 
to 
this 
legislation, 
the 
American people, thank God, will have 
a chance this November to elect a new 
Senate that will move this country in 
a dramatically different direction. 
I yield the floor.

5G SPECTRUM 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
United States is poised for nationwide 
deployment of the next generation of 
internet technology—5G. 5G will mark 
a giant leap forward for internet tech-
nology, delivering speeds that are up to 
100 times faster than what today’s 
technology can deliver. It will be vast-
ly more responsive than 4G technology 
and will be able to connect 100 times 
the number of devices that can be con-
nected with 4G. 
While that will make it even easier 
to do the things we do today, like 
check our email or stream our favorite 
shows, the biggest benefits of 5G lie in 
the other technologies that it will en-
able—precision 
agriculture, 
medical 
and surgical innovations, safer vehi-
cles, and more. 
5G is already being deployed. Cities 
across the country, including Sioux 
Falls in my home State, are intro-
ducing 5G networks. There is still work 
to be done before 5G can be fully imple-
mented nationwide. A big part of that 
work is freeing up adequate spectrum 
to support the technology. 
Like all internet technology, 5G re-
lies on radio spectrum, or what we 
commonly call the airwaves. In the 
United States, radio spectrum is owned 
by the American taxpayer but is li-
censed to companies that make use of 
the spectrum to broadcast TV and 
radio programs, connect cell phone 
calls, 
and 
transmit 
internet 
data. 
Radio spectrum is divided into bands— 
low-band, mid-band, and high-band— 
according 
to 
frequency 
and 
wave-
length. Current wireless technology 
mostly relies on low-band spectrum, 
but 5G will require the full range of 
radio spectrum—low-band, mid-band, 
and high-band. 
The United States has done a good 
job freeing up high-band spectrum for 
5G, but we need to free up more mid- 
band spectrum to see full-scale 5G de-
ployment. Mid-band spectrum is cru-
cial for 5G. It combines strong data ca-
pacity with good geographical coverage 
and allows 5G signals to penetrate 
buildings in more urban areas. Mid- 
band spectrum is particularly crucial 
for rural 5G deployment, as it can pro-
vide the coverage and capacity to reach 
less populated areas. 
As past chairman of the Senate Com-
merce Committee and current chair-
man of the Commerce Subcommittee 
on Communications, Technology, Inno-
vation, and the Internet, I have been 
working on 5G for a number of years 
now. In 2018, Congress passed my MO-
BILE NOW Act, which laid the ground-
work for freeing up more spectrum for 
5G. 
This past November, Senator WICKER 
and I introduced the 5G Spectrum Act 
to require the Federal Communications 
Commission to free up a critical por-
tion of mid-band spectrum, commonly 
referred to as C band, for 5G use. While 
Congress did not enact our legislation, 
at the end of February, the Federal 
Communications 
Commission 
an-
nounced it would adopt a framework 
similar to that outlined in our bill to 
make 280 megahertz of C band spec-
trum available for 5G. 
Currently, C band spectrum is li-
censed by satellite companies that use 
the spectrum to deliver programming 
for television and radio broadcasters, 
among other things. Under the FCC’s 
new rules, the majority of this mid- 
band spectrum will be made available 
to wireless companies for 5G. Satellite 
companies will still be able to provide 
all the services they are currently pro-
viding by launching new satellites and 
investing in new technologies to make 
more efficient use of the C band. The 
licensees for the remaining portion of 
the C band spectrum will be returned 
to the government, which will then 
offer the spectrum to wireless compa-
nies in a public auction. Satellite com-
panies will be reimbursed for the cost 
of relocating their operations to the 
upper range of the band, and they will 
be offered incentives for moving their 
operations quickly so that space for 5G 
can be freed up as soon as possible. I 
was very pleased by the FCC’s decision, 
which I think provides the most expe-
ditious and efficient way to free up the 
necessary mid-band spectrum for 5G. 
Some have argued that rather than 
reimbursing satellite companies, the 
government should just pull the sat-
ellite companies’ licenses, but there 
are a number of problems with that ap-
proach. 
First of all, while it is true that radio 
spectrum is owned by the taxpayers, 
satellite companies have invested a lot 
of money to put the spectrum into 
service. While they will still have 
enough C-band spectrum to provide 
current services, shifting their oper-
ations to the upper band of the spec-
trum will require a substantial invest-
ment. It is fair that they be reimbursed 
for this government-required shift. 
Furthermore, reimbursing companies 
and providing incentives for them to 
quickly free up spectrum is the fastest 
way to make that spectrum available. 
Simply demanding that companies re-
linquish their control of a substantial 
portion of the C band could tie the gov-
ernment up in litigation for years, 
while countries like China take the 
lead on 5G. 
Finally, setting a precedent for the 
government to simply seize spectrum 
licenses would create a significant dis-
incentive for technological investment. 
Why should companies invest major 
sums of money in bringing next-gen-
eration technologies to market if they 
are likely to have the licenses on which 
those technologies depend seized with-
out warning? 
The truth is that the taxpayers will 
see a bigger return—for deficit reduc-
tion, rural broadband, and other prior-
ities—if companies are incentivized to 
invest. The United States was at the 
head of the 4G revolution, and we need 
to ensure that we are at the head of the 
5G revolution as well. Winning the race 
to 5G will provide huge economic bene-
fits for American businesses and Amer-
ican workers, and it will allow the 
United States to set security standards 
for 
telecommunications 
networks 
worldwide. 
I am very pleased that the FCC has 
acted to free up mid-band spectrum 
needed for full-scale deployment of 5G 
around the country. I will continue to 
work to ensure that American compa-
nies and American workers have the 
resources they need to bring us into 
the 5G future. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER.

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, per-
haps later today or one day this week, 
we will have debate on the Senate floor 
and a vote, and that vote literally will 
decide the future for over 200,000 young 
Americans. 
Politicians and elected officials are 
prone to exaggeration, but I don’t ex-
aggerate when I say that, because we 
will have an opportunity here to debate 
and vote on a system that was put in 
place years ago to protect students 
from being defrauded by the colleges 
they attend. It is called the borrower 
defense program. It was started years 
ago. It was really designed for that 
rare situation where a student would 
take out a government loan to go to 
college after the college made mis-
representations about the education it 
offered. The student would rely on 
those misrepresentations, sign up for 
the school, sign up for the government 
loan, and learn, to his disappointment, 
months or years later that the school 
had lied to him. The school may have 
told him: If you take this certain 
course at this school, you will qualify 
for a certain job or licensure. The 
school may have misrepresented to the 
student that the courses they took at 
the school could be transferred to other 
schools if the student decided to go to 
a different university to complete their 
education. The misrepresentation may 
have been something as basic as saying 
‘‘All of our professors and instructors 
at this school have certain college de-
grees qualifying them to teach you,’’ or 
the school may have misrepresented to 
the student that ‘‘If you complete this 
course, here are the jobs that will be 
readily available for you to fill.’’ 
Students listen to those promises, 
sometimes rely on them, oftentimes

signing loans with the Federal Govern-
ment that need to be paid off later, and 
then they learn they were lied to. 
Because they were defrauded or lied 
to or misrepresentations were made, 
we set up a provision in the law that 
said there is a way out for the student. 
You don’t end up holding the bag here 
when a college or university which the 
United States government has recog-
nized as accredited has lied to you. You 
are not left holding the bag. There is 
another way out. Our Department of 
Education will take a look at your cir-
cumstances and decide whether there is 
evidence that this school has lied to 
you or misrepresented, and if we find 
it, we can restructure or forgive some 
part or all of your student loan debt. 
You know, that makes all the dif-
ference in the world to these students 
because here they are holding the bag, 
with tens, if not hundreds of thousands 
of dollars of debt because of lies that 
were made by the schools that tried to 
entice them into enrollment. It is 
called the borrower defense program. 
Under President Obama, thousands of 
students came to the program and said: 
We were lied to by these schools. 
Most of the schools are for-profit col-
leges and universities. One of the most 
notorious—Corinthian Colleges—is now 
bankrupt and gone, but for years, they 
were enticing thousands of Americans 
into their programs. They were signing 
up young students for courses, making 
them sign the loan agreements, and 
then after that was done, the students 
learned later on that the education was 
virtually worthless. 
What happened to Corinthian? Well, 
the people who started this for-profit 
college and university did quite well, 
thank you. All these students paid 
thousands of dollars to them, and even 
though they misrepresented the school 
to the students, they ended up taking 
the money and going home, and the 
school faced bankruptcy, and the stu-
dents are left holding the bag. That is 
the unfortunate reality we face. We can 
do something about it today. 
The Secretary of Education, Mrs. 
DeVos, has decided to change the way 
students have to go through proving 
their losses, and that is why we are 
here today. The House has voted over-
whelmingly saying Secretary DeVos’s 
approach was unfair. I will describe to 
you why we think it is unfair. 
What we are asking Members of the 
Senate to do today is take an honest 
look at the plight of these students and 
decide whether they are entitled to any 
relief under the proposal by Secretary 
DeVos. We estimate that fewer than 3 
percent of the students will receive any 
kind of relief because of the approach 
she uses. What we can do today is re-
ject that approach. This vote is not 
about 
any 
alternative 
approach. 
Though, we could sit down and actu-
ally negotiate a better way to deal 
with this. I have talked to Members on 
the Republican side about doing just 
that. 
The first step is to stop this new rule 
by Secretary DeVos, and that will be 
an opportunity we have today. If we 
stop these rules she has promulgated, 
then the students will have a chance to 
have some part of their student loan 
forgiven—perhaps all of it—if they can 
prove through evidence that they have 
been defrauded. 
Let me be more specific about what 
we are facing here. In 1992, Congress 
added a provision to the Higher Edu-
cation Act which I just described called 
the borrower defense program. It al-
lowed student borrowers defrauded by 
their schools to have their Federal stu-
dent loans discharged. Congress rightly 
didn’t want students left holding the 
bag because the schools had been 
guilty of misconduct. It was really a 
little known or rarely used portion of 
the law until the year 2014 with the 
collapse of the for-profit giant Corin-
thian Colleges. 
Corinthian had lied to students one 
after the other. They inflated their job 
placement rates, saying to students: 
Take these courses, and there are plen-
ty of jobs waiting for you. They took 
out loans for students without the 
knowledge of the students, and then 
they lied to the students about employ-
ers’ recognizing their degrees. 
Yet Corinthian was not unique. Near-
ly every other major for-profit college 
has been the subject of multiple State 
and Federal investigations and law-
suits for similar predatory practices. 
Since 2015—just 5 years ago—nearly 
300,000 student borrowers, mostly from 
these for-profit colleges, have applied 
to our U.S. Department of Education 
for borrower defense discharges. They 
have said: We were lied to. These 
schools lied to us about what the edu-
cation would mean to our futures. 
They enticed us into getting student 
loans, and we learned too late that we 
have been subjects of this fraud. Now, 
because our lives have been com-
promised with the great debts that we 
carry, we are asking for relief from a 
1992 law that has been established. 
Almost 220,000 of these students have 
pending claims with the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education. Do you know how 
long they have been waiting for resolu-
tions so they know if they can get on 
with their lives? Many of them have 
been waiting for years. The claims 
come from every State in the Union— 
large, small, red, blue, purple. It 
doesn’t make any difference. 
Sadly, it is not going to stop. The De-
partment 
of 
Education’s 
estimates 
show that nearly 200,000 student bor-
rowers will be subject to illegal prac-
tices by their schools in 2021 alone. The 
schools continue to make these mis-
representations to students. 
With the new borrower defense rule, 
Secretary DeVos at the Department of 
Education will make it virtually im-
possible for these future defrauded bor-
rowers to receive the borrower defense 
discharge that Congress intended. The 
DeVos rule places unreasonable new 
burdens on defrauded borrowers, in-
cluding requiring the student bor-
rowers to submit evidence that they 
will have to obtain by hiring lawyers 
and private detectives. For example, 
defrauded borrowers will have to show 
that the schools intentionally misled 
them. How are they supposed to do 
that? 
In addition, the rule requires de-
frauded borrowers to apply and submit 
evidence individually instead of being 
able to apply as a group when many 
borrowers have experienced similar 
misconduct across a program or school. 
Think about these schools that have 
been investigated by so many different 
States and have been found guilty of 
predatory practices, of exploiting these 
college students. The schools have been 
found guilty of defrauding these stu-
dents in State, after State, after State. 
Under the new rule by Secretary 
DeVos, to be discharged under this bor-
rower defense program, each one of the 
students has to essentially lawyer up. 
Each one of the students has to hire an 
investigator. 
What is the likelihood that a student 
who is burdened with debt and is strug-
gling to find a job is going to go out 
and make those expenditures? It is 
next to nothing. In fact, it turns out it 
is about 3 percent of the students who 
are likely to be able to take advantage 
of that. Secretary DeVos is basically 
telling these student borrowers: You 
are on your own. Lawyer up. Hire a pri-
vate detective to find the evidence. 
This is unfair and unrealistic. We 
need to go no further than the Depart-
ment’s own statistics to realize that 97 
percent of the students have no chance 
under this DeVos rule. By the experts’ 
best testimony, only 3 percent have a 
chance of recovering under this new ap-
proach. That is the rule we will get a 
chance to vote on this week, whether 
that rule should continue. 
The Department claims that these 
new hurdles for borrowers are nec-
essary to guard against fraudulent 
claims made by students, but there is 
no evidence—none—of widespread fraud 
on the part of borrowers among the 
300,000 borrower defense claims that 
have already been submitted. In fact, 
the Department itself notes that it 
does not have sufficient information to 
determine the extent of any potential 
fraud by students. There is no evidence 
whatsoever of this notion that Sec-
retary DeVos’s rule is needed because 
of fraud by borrowers. The new rule 
just means that defrauded borrowers 
with legitimate claims are not going to 
get relief. 
The Department also claims the 
DeVos rule protects taxpayers by shift-
ing the burden of relief from the tax-
payers to the schools that commit mis-
conduct. Yet it then turns around and 
acknowledges that other changes in 
the rule will, in fact, reduce recoveries 
from schools compared to the 2016 rule, 
and that means more cost for tax-
payers. 
The truth is, of the small amount of 
relief that will be awarded under the 
DeVos rule, schools will be on the hook 
for about one-third of it at the most. In

reality, the DeVos rule achieves sav-
ings on the backs of the borrowers who 
are victims of fraud. It eliminates $11 
billion in relief while it reduces the 
share of relief that the schools which 
are guilty of fraud have to pay. 
The Department also acknowledges 
that the DeVos rule is not expected to 
significantly change the percentage of 
loan volume subject to misconduct. In 
other words, this rule will not only 
generate less money from the offending 
schools, but it will be less likely to dis-
courage future misconduct by the same 
schools. On the other hand, the former 
Department inspector general said the 
2016 rule would ‘‘avoid costs to stu-
dents and taxpayers that result from 
school closures.’’ 
I could go on, but the bottom line is 
this: If we want to stop this insidious 
practice of defrauding students and 
having them pile up debt from schools 
that are phony and that eventually all 
go out of business, we have to have a 
program that is sensitive to the needs 
of the student borrowers and that puts 
these schools that are guilty of mis-
conduct on the hook for the payoff 
rather than the taxpayers. 
The DeVos rule eliminates the prohi-
bition in the 2016 rule that prevents 
schools from using mandatory arbitra-
tion and class action restriction as a 
condition of student enrollment. What 
is mandatory arbitration? It is basi-
cally saying to the students and their 
families: You can’t go to court. You 
have to go into a closed room, sit 
across the table from one of our law-
yers, and take it or leave it. 
That is what mandatory arbitration 
is all about. Class action restrictions 
mean that the students of one school 
that defrauded thousands of students 
can’t come together in any kind of 
legal action. 
You don’t see those kinds of provi-
sions for mandatory arbitration and 
class action restrictions in the con-
tracts that most students run into 
when they sign up at colleges and uni-
versities. It is almost exclusively in 
the area of private, for-profit colleges 
and universities. The clauses are often 
buried in stacks of enrollment docu-
ments that students rarely, if ever, 
read. It means that the schools can de-
fraud and mislead students and that 
they are protected from being held ac-
countable in court. Businesses around 
America are held accountable for their 
conduct and misconduct. Why would 
we let the for-profit colleges and uni-
versities off the hook? 
Students have nowhere else to turn 
other than to the taxpayers through 
this borrower defense program that we 
are discussing here. Instead of allowing 
borrowers to hold their schools directly 
accountable for misconduct in court, 
Secretary DeVos’s rule shields these 
schools from accountability and puts 
American taxpayers on the hook. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD a letter that was 
published in the Charlotte Observer 
over the weekend. It was written by 
Shaun Joyce, of Greensboro, NC. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Charlotte Observer, Mar. 8, 2020] 
A DWINDLING DEFENSE AGAINST A 
FRAUDULENT SCHOOL, BIG LOANS 
(By Shaun Joyce) 
I’m one of 300,000 people who applied for 
‘‘borrower defense,’’ a government rule that 
is supposed to cancel federal student loan 
debt for borrowers who have been scammed 
by their schools, almost 8,000 of us from 
North Carolina. Education Secretary Betsy 
DeVos has made it harder for defrauded stu-
dents by rewriting the borrower defense rule 
with so many restrictions that only 3 per-
cent of the people who were lied to by their 
schools will get the relief the law says they 
should. 
Fortunately, the U.S. House of Representa-
tives has already voted to strike down 
DeVos’ rewrite, and the Senate is set to vote 
on it later this month. This won’t help my 
situation because of when I took out my stu-
dent loans, but I’m hoping that North Caro-
lina Sens. RICHARD BURR and THOM TILLIS 
will stand up for people cheated by predatory 
colleges—and pass the bill to provide some 
justice. I always thought college would be 
the magic key to unlock opportunity and 
open the door to the life I wanted. My moth-
er had to drop out before she earned her de-
gree, but always told me, ‘‘Go to school.’’ 
After learning about the Art Institute of 
Charlotte, I thought, 
‘‘Here’s my chance,’’ envisioning a future 
as a video game designer. Art Institute re-
cruiters at a college fair convinced me the 
school was perfect for me. A week later, a 
representative barely glanced at my port-
folio, more interested in selling me and my 
mother on all sorts of loans. She said the 
school would prepare me for the job market 
and connect me to people who could help me 
land a job. My Bachelor’s would cost me 
around $64,000, an amount that seemed a lit-
tle intimidating. But she talked about a 
number of options—all loans—to help pay for 
it. She assured me that if my mother didn’t 
qualify for a parent PLUS loan, the school 
itself would cosign loans for me. 
We signed. I was on my way to earning the 
college degree that would change my life. 
And it did. But not in any way I would want. 
Today, I owe nearly $100,000 for a degree 
that didn’t prepare me for a job within the 
gaming industry. I work writing on—hold 
telephone messages for a marketing com-
pany and attend one class at a time at my 
local community college, working toward a 
degree in biology—none of my Art Institute 
classes transferred. 
The Art Institute of Charlotte shut down 
two years ago, but my degree was worthless 
before then. None of my classes had anything 
to do with video game design. The school 
kept pushing me to take out more loans, and 
I didn’t feel I could leave. I still had my 
dreams—and, as a young black man, the last 
thing I wanted to do was become just an-
other statistic by dropping out. I switched to 
an Associate ’s in hopes of saving money. 
When I asked about career opportunities, 
my adviser sent me Craig’s List job postings 
in California. I never saw any great opportu-
nities. I’m not the only one. Hundreds of 
thousands of people like me have attended 
colleges that failed to educate them, left 
them with crushing debt, and shut down for 
predatory lending and fraudulent recruit-
ment. 
I hope Congress comes through to provide 
these people struggling and in debt through 
no fault of their own with some relief. Sen-
ators Burr and Tillis should vote yes on Sen-
ate Joint Resolution 56. 
Shaun Joyce is a 2010 graduate of the Art 
Institute of Charlotte. He lives in Greens-
boro, N.C. 
Mr. DURBIN. Shaun is one of nearly 
6,000 borrowers from North Carolina 
who have applied to the Department 
for a borrower defense discharge. He at-
tended the Art Institute of Charlotte 
and thought it was his path to having 
a successful future. He was told by re-
cruiters that the school would prepare 
him for a job in video game designing 
and that those at the school would con-
nect him with people who would help 
him land that job. That is a pretty se-
rious promise to a young person, isn’t 
it? He said they kept pushing him to 
take on more and more courses and 
more and more debt. Eventually, he 
had so much debt that he felt there was 
no other option than to finish the de-
gree. He had to go all in with this 
school, the Art Institute of Charlotte. 
He writes: ‘‘[As] a young black man, 
the last thing I wanted to do was be-
come just another statistic by dropping 
out [of school].’’ 
Shaun owes nearly $100,000 in student 
loan debt today for a degree that did 
not prepare him for a job in the very 
industry he was promised. When he 
asked the Art Institute of Charlotte 
about career opportunities, do you 
know where they sent him? Craigslist. 
As of today, Shaun’s work is in writ-
ing on-hold telephone messages for a 
marketing company, and he attends 
one class at a time at his community 
college at which none—not one—of his 
Art Institute credits can be trans-
ferred. He has asked the Senate to 
overturn the DeVos rule. He knows the 
struggles defrauded student borrowers 
go through. 
I want to share with you a story of a 
U.S. Army veteran whose name is 
Jarrod Thoma. Jarrod is from the 
State of Colorado. After Jarrod left the 
Army, he wanted to pursue his lifelong 
passion for electronics by pursuing a 
degree in engineering. He signed up at 
the for-profit DeVry University in 
Westminster, CO. He said he quickly 
realized he was not getting the quality 
education it had promised. Course ma-
terials and the equipment for instruc-
tion were subpar and not as advertised. 
He says: ‘‘Although DeVry was more 
than happy to cash all of my GI Bill 
benefits, my complaints about quality 
[of the courses they were offering] fell 
on deaf ears.’’ 
When he tried to transfer, he found 
out that his credits wouldn’t transfer 
to a public university or even a com-
munity college even though DeVry had 
promised him they would. 
In addition to using his entire GI bill 
benefit for serving this country, he ac-
cumulated $52,000 in additional student 
loan debt in order to finish his program 
at DeVry. 
On top of that, Jarrod says: ‘‘Upon 
entering the job market, I quickly 
found that the degree . . . was not 
worth the paper it was printed on, and 
it actually hurt my job prospects.’’ 
Jarrod is waiting, along with 3,800 
other Coloradans, for the Department

to act on his borrower defense request, 
and he has urged the Senate to over-
turn the DeVos rule in order to help fu-
ture veteran borrowers like him. 
Let 
me 
also 
show 
you 
Tasha 
Berkhalter. I met her recently. She is a 
U.S. Army veteran from Lima, OH. She 
enrolled at ITT Tech, which is another 
notorious for-profit school. After she 
had been honorably discharged from 
serving in our U.S. Army, she was 
promised by ITT that her GI bill bene-
fits would cover the cost for the pro-
gram and that her program would lead 
to a job in her field after graduation. 
At one point, she tried to transfer, 
only to find out that other schools 
wouldn’t accept the credits she had 
earned at ITT Tech. She didn’t have 
any options. She had to finish at ITT. 
Not only did she exhaust her entire GI 
bill benefits at ITT Tech, but she had 
to take on additional Federal student 
loans despite all of ITT’s assurances 
that was not going to happen. Tasha’s 
student loan debt today for having at-
tended ITT Tech is almost $100,000 be-
yond her GI bill benefits—all for a de-
gree that she says no employer takes 
seriously. 
Of course, this puts a lot of pressure 
on her now. Tasha is married and has a 
family. She is facing overwhelming 
stress, anxiety, and depression because 
of the miserable experience she had 
with this for-profit school, ITT Tech, 
and the student debt she incurred. 
She served our country, and she 
risked her life for America. When it 
came to her GI bill benefits, she lost all 
of it at this for-profit school. She is 
asking for a chance to start over with 
her life, and our vote on the Senate 
floor may decide that. She even ques-
tions herself as a wife and as a mother 
of four young children because she is 
unable to provide for her family as she 
is still unable to get a job in her field. 
She has lost cars, homes, and has had 
to move from State to State. She sup-
ports overturning the DeVos borrower 
defense rule because she wants de-
frauded veterans like her to have a 
shot at relief. 
Veterans like Jarrod and Tasha are 
the reason that I bring this matter to 
the floor and ask my Republican and 
Democratic colleagues to join me. So 
many of us give speeches about our ap-
preciation for the veterans and their 
service to our country. So many of us 
voted for the GI bill benefit package. 
We said to veterans: We owe it to you. 
You served our country. We want to be 
on your side after that service so you 
can build good lives in America. 
Then schools like Corinthian and 
schools like ITT Tech defraud these 
students out of their GI bill benefits 
and pile additional debt on top of them. 
That is why this has become such a 
major veterans issue. 
Take a look at the veterans organiza-
tions that support the measure that I 
bring to the floor today: the American 
Legion—and I am going to quote from 
a letter from its national commander 
in just a moment; the Student Vet-
erans of America; the Iraq and Afghan-
istan Veterans of America; the Na-
tional Military Family Association; 
the Paralyzed Veterans of America; the 
Tragedy Assistance Program for Sur-
vivors; VetsFirst; Veterans for Com-
mon Sense; and Veterans Education 
Success. 
I would like to show you this last 
poster here. It is a letter that I re-
ceived from Bill Oxford. Bill, as you 
can see, is the national commander of 
the American Legion. He wrote to me 
on behalf of 2 million American Legion 
members whom he represents because 
he wanted to go on the record and give 
me a chance to bring this evidence be-
fore my fellow Senators, Republicans 
and Democrats. Many of them are 
being visited today by representatives 
of these veterans organizations, includ-
ing the American Legion. I hope they 
can spare a minute of their time in 
their offices in honor of these veterans 
and listen to the pleas they are going 
to make for a vote in favor of the 
measure I am going to bring before the 
Senate. 
Here is what Bill wrote in his letter 
to me: ‘‘Thousands of student veterans 
have been defrauded over the years— 
promised their credits would transfer 
when they wouldn’t, given false or mis-
leading job placement rates in mar-
keting, promised one educational expe-
rience . . . but given something com-
pletely different.’’ Bill calls this rule 
by Secretary DeVos ‘‘fundamentally 
rigged against defrauded borrowers’’ 
and writes that it ‘‘flagrantly denies 
defrauded veterans [fair and timely] 
decisions [on their claims].’’ 
Bill closes his letter by calling on 
Congress to overturn the DeVos rule. 
How many times have each of us 
stood on the floor and talked about 
honoring the sacrifices of men and 
women who serve our country in uni-
form? 
Well, we have a chance to do it with 
a vote this week—to put our votes 
where all of our speeches have been. We 
have a chance to stand up not just for 
the American Legion but for all the 
veterans groups that I referred to be-
fore, to give defrauded student vet-
erans and student loan borrowers a fair 
shot at the Federal student debt relief 
that Congress intended for them. 
We don’t do many things on a bipar-
tisan basis around here anymore, and 
it is a shame. I hope this will be an ex-
ception. Frankly, all of us have given 
these speeches on both sides of the 
aisle. All of us have said how much 
these veterans and their families mean 
to us. Well, now they are asking us to 
be on their side with this vote. 
I am urging my colleagues to show 
America that, when it comes to sup-
porting our veterans, the Senate, on a 
bipartisan basis, can come together 
and do the right thing. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, stu-
dent debt and student loans are a fre-
quent topic of conversation, and, of 
course, that is what we are discussing 
here today. As someone who took 
about 20 years to pay off my law school 
loans, this is personal. Fortunately, I 
was able to do so due to generous inter-
est rates and lending that helped facili-
tate people pursuing higher education 
and beyond. 
Across the United States, student 
loan debt totals nearly $1.6 trillion and 
is made up of some 45 million bor-
rowers. As more and more Americans 
are going to college and beyond, which 
is a good thing, this widespread prob-
lem isn’t going to go away any time 
soon. 
I agree that we need to take some ac-
tion here in Washington to address the 
financial burden for those with existing 
debt and to help give prospective stu-
dents a better understanding of what 
the debt that they will assume will 
mean to them in their future life, be-
fore it is too late. 
One of the leading candidates for 
President on the other side of the aisle, 
Mr. SANDERS, has suggested that we 
just make education free and that we 
eliminate all debt. Well, that is a fan-
tasy. There is no such thing as free. I 
am tempted to quote Milton Friedman, 
who said: There is no such thing as a 
free lunch. Of course, what he meant 
by that is that somebody, eventually, 
will pay. It may not be the immediate 
person who is the object of your boun-
ty, but somebody will pay. 
It is not financially responsible to 
just suggest that you are going to wipe 
away all debt, and it is certainly not 
fair to those who worked hard to earn 
the money to pay for their school only 
to find that those who did not find 
themselves with no debt. We have to 
come up with some commonsense an-
swers, not just live in a fantasy land. 
Of course, to say that we are going to 
wipe away the debt is not fair to the 
parents who started saving for their 
kids’ college even before they started 
walking or to the college student who 
worked multiple jobs to graduate with 
little or no debt at all or decided to go 
to community college at a lower cost 
before they then transferred to a 4-year 
institution and found a way to miti-
gate or keep their debt manageable. 
This idea of wiping away debt or mak-
ing everything free is unfair to the per-
son who chose not to go to college, 
only then to be saddled with someone 
else’s debt. That is not fair. 
So the problem with wiping away 
debt is that it is never really gone. You 
just pass the responsibility on to some-
one else, and we see that concept—that 
mentality—at play here today, when it 
comes to this rule promulgated by the 
Trump administration that our friends 
across the aisle seek to reverse. 
Last fall, the Department of Edu-
cation took a big step to forgive loans 
for students who have been defrauded 
by an institution of higher education 
without placing a serious burden on 
taxpayers. I think that is a good thing. 
People who commit fraud ought to be

held to account and those loans should 
be forgiven, but the burden should not 
be placed on taxpayers. 
There have been similar regulations 
around for decades, and, in 2016, the 
Obama administration made some seri-
ous changes that actually broadened 
the types of claims a student can 
make. They issued a rule that said a 
school’s substantial misrepresentation 
could result in a student’s loans being 
forgiven. 
But if my time in a courtroom 
taught me anything, it is that a good 
lawyer could portray even a factually 
accurate advertisement as somehow a 
misrepresentation, and there is no re-
quirement that it be material but just 
that there be some abstract misrepre-
sentation. 
I don’t have any doubt about the in-
tent of the law and that the intention 
is good, but the concept is far too 
broad and the sad truth is, being so 
broad, it is ripe for abuse, and that is 
exactly what the current rule in place 
sought to change—to maintain the 
ability to relieve debt as a result of 
fraud, but not make it so broad that it 
was subject to further abuse. 
The new rule establishes a clear 
standard for students to get individual 
debt relief and helps those impacted by 
school closures to find a way to finish 
their degree. It also takes big steps to 
hold schools accountable, which I be-
lieve is absolutely critical. We have 
this strange system where the school 
itself receives the tuition but has no 
accountability if the student is unable 
to complete their course of study or 
ends up getting a degree or a certifi-
cate in something that does not gen-
erate the income they need in order to 
pay that debt back. So we need to find 
ways to hold schools responsible, as 
well—as well as prevent predatory be-
havior from impacting more students, 
for example, targeting of veterans and 
then draining their GI bill benefits and 
leaving them with basically nothing to 
show for it. Those are the types of 
things we ought to be focusing on. 
Overall, this rule—the underlying 
rule that our Democratic colleagues 
seek to reverse—includes commonsense 
reforms to ensure it achieves the goal 
of helping students who are defrauded, 
while preventing taxpayers from foot-
ing the bill for a far-too-broad defini-
tion of what constitutes a misrepresen-
tation. 
It is disappointing to see that they 
are trying to take us back to the pre-
vious rule, which was so ripe for abuse. 
In doing so, it would cause serious 
harm to students and schools and to 
the American taxpayer. They will end 
up left holding the bag. 
Rather than zeroing out the loan bal-
ance for tens of millions of borrowers 
or allowing broad and vague allega-
tions of fraud, we need to look at tar-
geted changes that can make a huge 
difference. One place that I mentioned 
a moment ago where we need to focus 
is our veterans. I have heard from a 
number of my constituents who are 
straddled with student debt—many be-
fore the time they actually served in 
the military. 
If someone goes to college after leav-
ing the military, the GI bill of rights 
will cover a substantial part of their 
education. But what about those who 
went to college or graduate school be-
fore they went into the military, those 
who took out loans prior to their serv-
ice? 
Well, in most cases, the GI bill can-
not be applied retroactively, and serv-
icemembers are left footing the bill for 
an education that otherwise would 
have been covered if they had gone to 
school after their military service. 
Well, I don’t think we should cat-
egorically exempt student debt and tui-
tion incurred before military service 
and thus make the GI bill of rights, if 
you go into the military after that, 
worth basically nothing. These men 
and women should have the choice and 
the flexibility to use the benefits they 
have earned to pay off their student 
loans—in other words, use their GI bill 
of right retroactively, just as they 
would be able to use them pursuing a 
new degree. 
I will be introducing legislation soon 
to make that change and to help our 
servicemembers 
address 
loan 
debt 
using the benefits that they have al-
ready earned. 
We can’t just look at preexisting 
debt, though. We need to ensure that 
prospective students are making wise 
financial decisions on the front end. 
Unfortunately, that is easier said than 
done. There is no clear system that 
makes it easy for students to compare 
financial aid packages from one school 
to another and to decide what the true 
cost of each will be. Many times, it is 
like comparing apples and oranges, and 
sometimes it can be downright mis-
leading. 
Depending on how a school displays 
information 
about 
scholarships 
or 
other financial information, the dif-
ference in the pricetag can be pretty 
stark. It doesn’t matter whether you 
are a 17-year-old heading straight to 
college from high school or somebody 
who has been in the workforce for 
years and is now heading back to 
school. The process is far too con-
fusing, and it does not need to be. 
There are a lot of resources to help 
students get a clearer picture about 
their loan obligations and their ex-
pected salary after graduation and how 
that will impact their loan payments. 
Every student who incurs a penny of 
debt ought to have the information 
they need to be able to determine what 
amount of debt is acceptable in light of 
their 
future 
earning 
capacity 
and 
whether they will actually be able to 
get a degree that will allow them to 
pay back the money they borrowed for 
their school. 
I believe that is a shared responsi-
bility. Not only is that something that 
the student bears responsibility for, 
but I think the school they attend 
bears responsibility as well. 
At the very least, we ought to pro-
vide accurate information. For exam-
ple, the Department of Education has a 
calculator on their website that lets 
students calculate the net price of a de-
gree before ever deciding which school 
to go to or what kind of loan to take 
out. 
The issue, though, is that this infor-
mation isn’t always easy to find and 
colleges and universities are not doing 
a great job at promoting it. That needs 
to change. 
I am a proud cosponsor of several 
pieces of legislation that would help 
prospective students better understand 
the cost of their higher education on 
the front end. 
Three of these bills have been intro-
duced by our friend from Iowa, Senator 
GRASSLEY, and would simplify the 
process for prospective students. One of 
these bills would standardize the for-
mat in terms of financial aid so that 
students aren’t comparing apples to or-
anges; they are actually comparing ap-
ples to apples. Another would improve 
both the effectiveness and access to 
net-price calculators to help students 
make informed decisions before even 
deciding where to apply. The third 
would strengthen student loan coun-
seling requirements to schools, so stu-
dents are made aware of every option 
available, making it less likely that 
they will borrow more than they are 
likely to be able to repay. 
So despite what our colleagues across 
the aisle are saying, outright loan for-
giveness across the board isn’t the only 
path here. There are other options 
which I intend to pursue to make in-
cremental changes that will have a 
huge impact on people working to 
repay 
their 
student 
debt 
without 
spreading that burden to each and 
every single American taxpayer. While 
these ideas may not fit on a bumper 
sticker, that does not mean they are 
not worth pursuing. 
I look forward to working with our 
colleagues to try to address this prob-
lem of mounting student debt and the 
difficulty many students have of pay-
ing that debt back because of misin-
formation or bad decisions they made, 
unaided by the schools they attend, to 
determine whether the degree they are 
pursuing and the debt they are incur-
ring is actually realistic in light of 
their future income-earning capacity. 
We can address this sensibly and re-
sponsibly and in a way that does not 
affect each and every American tax-
payer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1649 
March 10, 2020 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
later today the Senate will be taking 
up the borrower defense CRA vote and 
likely voting on it tomorrow. Each and 
every Senator will have a choice. They 
can side with working students, or 
they can side with predatory, for-profit 
colleges. It should not be a hard choice, 
and that choice certainly should not be 
partisan. 
Students who were cheated and de-
frauded by predatory, for-profit col-
leges are often left with crushing debt 
and no path forward. That is why 
President Obama issued the borrower 
defense rule—to help students move 
forward with their lives and education 
and to get the debt relief they so ur-
gently need. 
Since taking office, Secretary DeVos 
has put up roadblock after roadblock 
for students and borrowers. First, she 
refused to implement the borrower de-
fense rule that was on the books, until 
a court forced her to. She stalled on 
debt relief for hundreds of thousands of 
borrowers who were left waiting for an 
answer, with tens of thousands of them 
falling into default and collections. 
Once again, the Federal courts were 
forced to step in. 
Now Secretary DeVos is trying to 
deny full relief to students who were 
clearly cheated by predatory colleges. 
For so many people, getting relief on 
your student debt means the difference 
between making ends meet or not, the 
difference between paying your rent or 
not, and the difference between getting 
back on your feet or not. 
Now, to make matters even worse, 
Secretary DeVos has gone further than 
just delaying and limiting the relief. 
She has issued a disastrous new bor-
rower defense rule intentionally de-
signed to make it harder for defrauded 
borrowers—defrauded 
borrowers—to 
get relief even when predatory colleges 
clearly violated the law. It will prevent 
students from getting their day in 
court and let predatory colleges off the 
hook financially. This rule says, in the 
fine print, that students will be stuck 
repaying 97 percent of their fraudulent 
debt. The Department even admitted 
that students will be cheated out of 
$2.5 billion per year, and students will 
only get 3 cents back for every dollar 
of fraud they experience. That is cruel 
and wrong. 
The Congressional Review Act, or 
CRA, would immediately halt Sec-
retary DeVos’s rule in its tracks and 
prevent it from going into effect. 
It is time to put an end to the non-
stop efforts by this administration to 
prioritize the interests of predatory, 
for-profit schools over the interests of 
our students. It is time for Senators to 
decide, once and for all, if they will 
support our student loan borrowers 
who have been cheated out of a quality 
education or help corrupt institutions 
with their bottom line. 
I want to personally thank Senator 
DURBIN for his tireless efforts to push 
this important issue forward. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if 
your car is a lemon, you don’t sue the 
bank; you sue the dealer. A college can 
be a lemon, just like a car can be. A 
college could promise a potential stu-
dent a job and then tell them that 50 
percent of their students scored per-
fectly on their SAT tests. The poten-
tial student might use that informa-
tion to take out student loans and en-
roll in a college. Then, if the informa-
tion turns out to be false, the student 
may be stuck with student loans they 
can’t afford to repay. Unlike a car, if 
your college is a lemon, you do sue the 
bank, and the bank is the taxpayer. 
Today, Democrats are forcing the 
Senate to vote on a Congressional Re-
view Act that, if passed, would over-
turn the Trump administration’s bor-
rower defense rule. This process allows 
a borrower of a Federal student loan to 
have their loan forgiven if their insti-
tution misled them and that misrepre-
sentation led to financial harm. 
First, if your college closes, it is im-
portant for you to know that your 
loans are forgiven. Let me say that 
again. If your college closes, it is im-
portant for you to know that your stu-
dent loan is forgiven. 
There are about 6,000 colleges and 
universities in our country, and 783 of 
them closed in 2018. For example, when 
Corinthian College closed, that made a 
lot of news. Many students, though, 
transferred to another college. But if 
they 
didn’t 
transfer, 
they 
weren’t 
stuck with their student loans; their 
loans were forgiven. 
We are not talking about that today 
when we vote. If your college isn’t clos-
ing but it does defraud or mislead you, 
then you can file a claim. You can file 
a claim to have your loan forgiven, and 
you file it with the U.S. Department of 
Education. 
There are 42 million Americans with 
an outstanding Federal student loan. 
In 2018, about 106,000 of those 42 million 
Americans filed what we call borrower 
defense claims. They claimed they 
were misled by the college when they 
used their student loan to go to that 
college. 
In November 2016, the Obama admin-
istration issued a rule that required a 
borrower to demonstrate only that 
they had been misled, not that they 
had 
been 
financially 
harmed. 
The 
Trump administration fixes that overly 
broad regulation, while still protecting 
borrowers and the taxpayer. 
Here is the difference. Under the 
Obama administration, if one student 
had filed a claim and proved that he or 
she had been defrauded, all the other 
students in that program had to do was 
attest they had been misled in a simi-
lar way before having their loans for-
given as well. It was sort of a class ac-
tion. 
It was unnecessary for the first stu-
dent or subsequent students to prove 
they had been financially harmed by 
that 
misrepresentation. 
What 
this 
meant is, if you went to a school that 
had misled students, your loan could be 
forgiven even if you had a job making 
$85,000 a year. 
Under the Trump administration, 
each student needs to file a claim, 
prove that they were defrauded and 
that they were financially harmed, and 
then their loan would be forgiven by 
the taxpayer. Remember, the bank is 
the taxpayer. 
Secretary DeVos’s borrower defense 
rule restores the original intent of the 
law that a borrower must be misled 
and harmed. 
The new rule establishes a fair and 
clear process as to what a borrower 
must demonstrate: No. 1, that the 
school misled them; No. 2, that the stu-
dent relied on that information to en-
roll in the school; and No. 3, that the 
student was financially harmed. The 
new rule gives the borrower ample time 
to submit a claim and ensures that the 
Department is basing their judgment 
on all available information. 
The DeVos rule also protects the tax-
payers who spend roughly $100 billion a 
year on Federal student loans. It con-
tinues to allow the Secretary to recoup 
funds from an institution that has de-
frauded or misled borrowers. It encour-
ages borrowers and the institution to 
resolve issues directly rather than in-
volving the Federal Government. 
And the new rule allows the Depart-
ment to evaluate the level of harm to 
each individual borrower filing the 
claim and forgives the appropriate 
amount. For example, if you were told 
by the school that you would make 
$45,000 a year when you graduated, but 
you are only making $40,000, the De-
partment could decide to forgive a part 
of your loan. 
The Obama administration’s rules 
went too far and allowed borrowers to 
have their loans forgiven whether or 
not they had actually suffered finan-
cial harm. Secretary DeVos’s new bor-
rower defense rule restores the original 
intent of the law that the borrower 
must be misled and harmed. 
I encourage Senators to vote against 
today’s Congressional Review Act. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1650 
March 10, 2020 
reforms since Watergate—1 year. H.R. 1 
shines a light on secret campaign con-
tributions, makes it easier to vote, and 
cleans up corruption in Washington. It 
is the solution to the gridlock that the 
American people are tired of in our Na-
tion’s Capital. But for 1 year, H.R. 1 
has gathered dust on Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL’s desk. 
Every single Senator in the Demo-
cratic Congress and in our caucus here 
in the Senate is cosponsoring the For 
the People Act, which is Senator 
MERKLEY’s and my companion bill to 
H.R. 1, For the People Act, but it is 
buried deep in the leader’s legislative 
graveyard. 
Over the course of the last year, as 
the For the People Act has languished, 
tens of millions of dollars were spent— 
much of it in secret—to influence the 
policymaking process. 
Almost half a dozen States passed 
new laws restricting voter rights. The 
U.S. Supreme Court gave the green 
light to political gerrymandering. And 
President Trump, visiting his own 
properties dozens of times, funneled 
millions of taxpayer dollars into his 
own pocket. Yet, the Republican Sen-
ate is silent—silent as our democracy 
faces a crisis like none we have ever 
seen in our lifetimes. 
We can draw a straight line from the 
crisis in our democracy to more than 
300 bipartisan bills buried in the major-
ity leader’s graveyard. The bills wait-
ing for Senate action are broadly sup-
ported by the American people, but 
they are opposed by the ultrawealthy, 
the special interests, the powerful cor-
porations in that they try to buy our 
elections. Like Senator MCCONNELL, 
these Big Money interests are proud of 
killing these bills. 
Here is what happened over the year 
that the For the People Act has been in 
the majority leader’s graveyard: The 
number of Americans without health 
insurance increased by hundreds of 
thousands. California wildfires, wors-
ened by climate change, cost $25 bil-
lion. Flooding in the Midwest, also a 
casualty of climate change, cost $12.5 
billion. And 22 people were gunned 
down at an El Paso Walmart by a 
White nationalist armed with an as-
sault rifle. Sadly, that was just a frac-
tion of the thousands of gun-related 
deaths in our country last year. 
This is not the America that the 
American people want. The American 
people want us to act. The gap between 
what the American people are clam-
oring for and what the Republican ma-
jority in the Senate is giving them is 
as wide as the Grand Canyon and is 
growing by the day. 
Just look at the polls. Staggering 
numbers—closing in on 90 percent of 
Americans—support universal, afford-
able healthcare. With these numbers, 
you would think Republicans would be 
making sure that every American has 
healthcare, but, instead, Republicans 
have tried to dismantle the Affordable 
Care Act every chance they get. As we 
speak, President Trump and 18 Repub-
lican Governors and attorneys general 
are urging the Supreme Court to strike 
down the Affordable Care Act. 
The American people want exorbi-
tant prescription drug prices reeled in. 
Eighty percent of Americans think the 
cost of prescription drugs is far too 
high, and we all know that Big Pharma 
is the reason why. Yet legislation to 
reduce drug costs is also stuck—stuck 
among the hundreds of other bills on 
the majority leader’s desk. Over the 
last two-plus decades, Big Pharma has 
spent $3.7 billion—yes, that is billion— 
on lobbying. So today the same vial of 
insulin, which cost $175 15 years ago, 
costs more than $1,400 today. As a re-
sult, some diabetics ration their insu-
lin, and some, as a result, have died. 
It is not just our healthcare. The 
ability of our planet to support human 
life as we know it is at stake. Time and 
again, polling tells us the American 
people want us to tackle climate 
change. The American people accept 
the science. They understand the exis-
tential threat. Yet dozens of climate 
change bills lie dead in the Senate, in-
cluding 
my 
Renewable 
Electricity 
Standard Act, to move us to 100 per-
cent clean energy by midcentury. 
Nearly 70 percent of Americans, in-
cluding a majority of Republicans, be-
lieve we need to take aggressive action 
to fight climate change, and almost 80 
percent believe the government should 
invest more in renewable energy re-
sources. With these kinds of numbers, 
you would think Congress would be 
passing climate change legislation on a 
regular basis, except you would be 
wrong. Why? 
Well, an expert analysis found that 
from 2000 to 2016, $2 billion was spent 
on lobbying regarding climate policy, 
and the fossil fuel interests outspent 
environmental public interest groups 
by a factor of 10 to 1. This is not de-
mocracy at work. This is a complete 
perversion of our democratic ideals. 
But the good news is we can change 
all of this. We can reinvigorate our de-
mocracy. We can end the reign of Big 
Money, empower small donors, make it 
easier to vote, stop political gerry-
mandering, and bring ethical conduct 
to Washington. The majority leader 
just needs to stop doing the bidding of 
the wealthy special interests and bring 
the For the People Act to the Senate 
floor. 
I 
know 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
MERKLEY is here and Senator BENNET, 
Senator 
WHITEHOUSE, 
and 
Senator 
CARDIN. 
I yield to Senator CARDIN. Thank you 
all for being here today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
want to thank Senator UDALL for his 
leadership on the For the People Act, 
and I want to thank Senator MERKLEY 
for his leadership on this bill. 
This bill contains many provisions 
that deal with the fundamental values 
of this country. I also am proud of my 
colleague in the House of Representa-
tives, Congressman SARBANES, who is 
the lead sponsor of H.R. 1, which is the 
For the People Act. It passed the House 
of Representatives over a year ago, and 
there has been no action on the floor of 
the Senate as a result of the majority 
leader’s decision not to bring these 
bills to the floor. 
As I said, it includes a lot of different 
bills that all deal with America’s val-
ues. These are the values that are the 
strength of this Nation—free and fair 
elections. That is what we promote 
globally because we know that is key 
to a stable democratic society. Yet 
when you look at the way we conduct 
elections in this country, we are not 
setting a very high example. Look at 
how much money is involved in elec-
tions in this country. From the Presi-
dent of the United States to our local 
offices, too much money speaks to who 
is going to be able to get the attention 
of the voters. We need to change that. 
We know that suppression of voters 
has been institutionalized as a strategy 
to win office. That should have no 
place in America. We should want the 
maximum amount of voters to partici-
pate in our political process, not try to 
prevent people from exercising their 
right to vote. 
The For the People Act brings about 
meaningful change so that America, 
which is the shining example of democ-
racy, can lead the world by the way we 
conduct our own elections. Let me 
mention two provisions that I am par-
ticularly pleased are included in the 
For the People Act. One is democracy 
restoration; that is, to allow those who 
have been convicted of crime, after 
they have served their penalty, to be 
able to participate in elections. We are 
one of only a few western democracies 
that permanently disenfranchise an in-
dividual who has been convicted of a 
felony. There are 6.1 million adults who 
currently are disenfranchised as a re-
sult of that provision, yet only 22 per-
cent of those individuals are incarcer-
ated. The other 78 percent have paid 
their penalty, have done their time, 
and are now reintegrated into society. 
It is in our interest to have them par-
ticipate in our democratic system. It 
reduces recidivism. And, quite frankly, 
it is targeted at people of color. They 
are who have been most disenfran-
chised as a result of this provision. 
Thirty-four States still have restric-
tions, and 12 have lifetime restrictions 
on those convicted of a felony. The De-
mocracy Restoration Act would rem-
edy that situation. 
The second bill I am going to refer to 
very briefly is the Deceptive Practices 
and Voter Prevention Act that targets 
primarily minority voters to suppress 
their vote. It is the modern Jim Crow 
laws in which we find we are using 
modern technology. We have campaign 
strategies aimed at minority commu-
nities to give them misinformation 
about how they can vote or whether 
they are eligible to vote or where they 
can vote. That is being used today. We 
have to make sure that doesn’t happen 
in the American election system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1651 
March 10, 2020 
For the People provides meaningful 
changes so that we don’t allow suppres-
sion of votes to be an institutionalized 
strategy to try to win an election, so 
that we have the maximum participa-
tion of voters in our process, and it 
deals with the ever-flowing increase in 
the amount of dollars that are put into 
American elections. 
The U.S. Senate should not be a 
graveyard. Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL has prevented hundreds of bills— 
bipartisan bills—from coming to the 
floor of the U.S. Senate. It has been a 
year since we have had the For the 
People Act passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives. It is well past time for 
the Senate to take up this legislation 
so that we can show the American peo-
ple we support the values that have 
made America the great democracy in 
our country. 
Thank you very much. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, Shakespeare’s great play ‘‘Ham-
let’’ began with the phrase: Something 
is rotten in Denmark. 
Well, something is rotten in Con-
gress, and what is rotten in Congress is 
dark money. Citizens United—perhaps 
one of the most foolish decisions ever 
rendered by the U.S. Supreme Court— 
opened unlimited spending into our 
politics, which benefits whom? It bene-
fits those who have unlimited money 
to spend and a motive to spend it in 
politics. That is not a group of people 
whose voices were not being heard here 
already. That is the favored group. But 
Citizens United opened the door for 
them to spend unlimited money, and 
then the Supreme Court failed to po-
lice its own decision. Its own decision 
said this unlimited spending was going 
to be independent of candidates and 
transparent to the public. Well, they 
are 0 for 2. It has been a decade, and 
they have never even tried to enforce 
the basic predicates of their decision. 
It is a shameful, shameful effort by the 
Court. Now, as a result, we have 
throughout 
our 
politics 
this 
dark 
money tsunami of slime. 
How bad is it? These groups have 
spent 
$4.5 
billion 
since 
Citizens 
United—$4.5 billion trying to influence 
Congress. Do you think they were 
doing that in the public interest? Of 
course not. Do you wonder why bills 
die here in the legislative graveyard of 
the Senate? Take a guess. 
Outside groups—these phony-baloney 
front groups for these big special inter-
ests—are now outspending candidates 
in races. In fact, in the decade after 
Citizens United, outside groups out-
spent candidates in 126 different con-
gressional races. And it is a very small 
group of people behind it. The top 10 
donor households gave a combined $1.1 
billion to these front groups. Do you 
think they were looking out for the 
public interests? Dream on. 
Who are the big spenders of this dark 
money? National Rifle Association; 
Americans for Prosperity, which is the 
Koch brothers front group; Crossroads 
GPS, which is Karl Rove’s front group; 
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, 
the champions of climate denial and 
obstruction. 
Do you want to know why we are not 
getting things done around here? It is 
because billions of dollars are being 
spent secretly by special interests to 
shut things down, and it is creeping 
now even into the courts. The Fed-
eralist Society, which is picking our 
judges, is at the center of a $250 million 
dark money network. A group that ran 
the campaigns against Garland and for 
Gorsuch 
and 
then 
afterward 
for 
Kavanaugh got an individual $17 mil-
lion donation for each of those two 
campaigns. It is actually probably the 
same donor, which means somebody 
out there anonymously gave $35 mil-
lion to determine the makeup of the 
U.S. Supreme Court, and we don’t 
know who that is. We don’t know what 
business they have before the Court. 
As I said, Hamlet begins with ‘‘some-
thing is rotten in . . . Denmark.’’ 
Something is rotten in Congress, and 
the rot is creeping over to the Supreme 
Court, and it is dark money, and it is 
the patriotic and decent thing to do to 
extirpate this menace. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, last 
year, I was proud to stand with my col-
leagues as we introduced the For the 
People Act in the Senate just weeks 
after it passed the House of Represent-
atives. 
This 
measure 
has 
already 
passed the House of Representatives. 
If you took civics 101, they explain 
that after the House took action on a 
measure, it came here. So the obvious 
question is, What happened to it? It 
has been a year. It must be here some-
where. Well, we know exactly where it 
is. It is in Senator MCCONNELL’s office. 
He is the Republican Leader of the U.S. 
Senate, and he has made a conscious 
decision that hundreds of bills just like 
this one will not even be considered on 
the floor of the Senate. It isn’t that he 
doesn’t have a majority; he does. But 
he doesn’t want us to even debate or 
discuss these bills before the American 
people. 
This U.S. Senate once enjoyed its 
reputation as the world’s most delib-
erative body, which means we came 
here, debated, argued, and voted on 
things like amendments and bills like 
this one. Last year in the U.S. Senate, 
the calendar year 2019, we considered 
exactly 22 amendments in the entire 
year—22 amendments in 1 year in this 
Senate. Six of them were offered by 
Senator PAUL, who, with a gun to our 
heads, said: If you don’t give me a vote 
on my amendment, you can’t go home. 
All six of his amendments were de-
feated, but that just gives you an ex-
ample of why there is so little activity 
and why this floor is so empty so many 
times. 
In fact, this floor has become a mu-
seum piece where bystanders, wit-
nesses, and spectators can come in, sit 
in the Galleries, and look down on the 
desks that used to be occupied by Sen-
ators who debated and voted. We don’t 
do that anymore. Instead, we consider 
one after the other after the other of 
judicial nominations. I am not going to 
get into that issue because it has been 
touched on already. 
My contribution to this For the Peo-
ple Act goes to the heart of political 
campaigns. If you don’t think Amer-
ican 
political 
campaigns 
are 
long 
enough, if you would like us to be on 
television a few more months each 
year, hang on tight because it is com-
ing. If you don’t think enough money 
is being spent on American political 
campaigns, hang on tight because more 
is coming. If you want to reach the 
point where we have no idea where 
most of the money is coming from that 
funds these campaigns, hang on. The 
Citizens United decision by the Su-
preme Court across the street has set 
the stage for that, and that is where we 
are headed in America today. 
My proposal for fair elections now 
moves in exactly the opposite direc-
tions—shorter campaigns, smaller con-
tributions, more confrontation between 
candidates over issues than to have 
this battle of television ads that goes 
on now. 
My act would create a voluntary, 
small-donor, public financing system 
for Senate candidates who agree to 
raise only small-dollar contributions. I 
know it is a dream, but think about 
what it would do to change American 
politics. Here is how it would work: 
Qualified Senate candidates would re-
ceive grants based on their State’s pop-
ulation, 6-to-1 matching grants for con-
tributions they get of $200 or less— 
smaller contributors—and vouchers for 
purchasing television advertising other 
than social media. Once candidates 
reach the maximum amount of match-
ing funds they receive, they continue 
to raise an unlimited amount of con-
tributions of $200 or less—a $200 cap on 
contributions. They can also raise 
money from small-donor political ac-
tion committees, known as People 
PACs, which allow citizens to make 
their voices heard by aggregating just 
small contributions—no big hitters. 
The fair elections public financing 
system would elevate the views and in-
terests of a diverse group of Americans, 
rather than the traditional wealthy 
class, and we would pay for it without 
spending a dime in taxpayer dollars. 
Our system would be financed with as-
sessments on wealthy bad actors and 
industry law breakers. In the 2018 mid-
term elections, the price of victory for 
a successful House congressional can-
didate averaged about $2 million, and 
35 Senate candidates who won in 2018 
spent an average of $15.7 million 
apiece. 
If we don’t rein in the cost and 
length of campaigns, shame on us. We 
have to reclaim the reputation of this 
great Congress and the U.S. Senate, 
and it starts with the way we finance 
our campaigns.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1652 
March 10, 2020 
In addition to the Fair Elections Now 
Act, this bill has measures to increase 
access to the ballot box, to strengthen 
election security, to improve oversight 
in our campaign finances, and to re-
move corruption from office. 
I think it is outrageous that we live 
in an America in which people are 
dreaming up ways to restrict and re-
strain people’s right to vote. If there is 
anything fundamental to a democracy, 
it is the vote of those who are legally 
entitled in America. I have been in this 
business for a while. I started off by 
losing a few elections. I didn’t enjoy a 
moment of that, but there was a notion 
that at least the American people had 
spoken in those elections, and I accept-
ed the verdicts of those people. They 
have come back and given me a few 
chances since to be in public service. 
Let’s make sure the American people 
have the voice—the most important 
voice in this process—through their 
right to vote. Keep foreigners out of 
the process, and put Americans into 
them. Don’t make it hard to vote. 
Make it easy for those who are legally 
entitled to vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor to mark the 1-year 
anniversary of the House passage of 
H.R. 1, the For the People Act. I am 
honored to be here with my colleagues, 
and I am here to urge the Republicans 
to bring this legislation to the floor for 
a vote. 
This bill has been languishing in the 
legislative graveyard for a year. I know 
because I have 13 provisions in this bill. 
This bill—the combined work of so 
many people in this Chamber, includ-
ing of my friends Senator UDALL, Sen-
ator MERKLEY, and many others— 
would fundamentally improve our de-
mocracy by protecting voting rights, 
securing our election systems, and get-
ting dark money out of our campaign 
system. 
Why is it so important for us to act 
on this bill? Every one of the things we 
want to get done—finally addressing 
the climate crisis, immigration reform, 
improving people’s healthcare, making 
healthcare more affordable—depend on 
there being a democracy that works so 
people can make sure their votes 
count. 
At a time when the right to vote is 
under attack, when foreign adversaries 
are trying to exploit our divisions and 
interfere in our elections—something 
we are going to be briefed about this 
afternoon from intelligence agencies— 
and when an unprecedented amount of 
money from special interests is drown-
ing out the voices of the American peo-
ple, we need to take bold action to re-
store Americans’ confidence in our po-
litical system. That is exactly what 
the For the People Act does. 
As the ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Rules and Administration, I 
know this bill is important. I am frus-
trated that we have not had more 
Rules 
Committee 
hearings 
about 
things like the oversight of the FEC. I 
am frustrated that, just today, a Re-
publican Commissioner was put forth 
for a hearing, recommended by the 
White House, when there is a highly 
qualified Democratic candidate who 
would be the first person of color in 
history to serve on the Federal Elec-
tion Commission who has been vetted 
and has cleared the White House. Yet 
we only saw the Republican candidate. 
This is why this bill is so important. 
This year marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the passage of the 19th Amend-
ment, which granted women the right 
to vote. As we celebrate, we are re-
minded that, throughout our country’s 
history, the right to vote has been hard 
fought and hard won. Just 2 weeks ago, 
I had the honor of joining Congressman 
JOHN
LEWIS—a true hero for voting 
rights—on 
the 
55th 
annual 
Selma 
bridge crossing to commemorate the 
sacrifices made on Bloody Sunday. 
When we reflect on the sacrifices 
that have been made for the right to 
vote, one thing is truly clear—that the 
fight is not over. There are people 
today who are working to take the 
right to vote away. Their work comes 
in many forms: voter ID laws, gerry-
mandered 
districts, 
purging 
people 
from voting rolls, and one that we just 
saw just last week on Super Tuesday— 
polling place closures that result in 
voters having to wait hours in line just 
to cast their ballots. Just last week in 
the State of Texas, some African- 
American voters waited more than 5 
hours in line. When a reporter asked 
one group of voters how the group got 
through it, a man said: We thought 
they were making us wait on purpose, 
so we motivated each other to stay. 
The policies that led to those long 
lines didn’t happen by accident. Dis-
crimination in voting is happening, as 
the Fourth Circuit noted in a North 
Carolina decision on gerrymandering— 
and these are the words of the judges— 
with ‘‘surgical precision.’’ Discrimina-
tion in voting is happening with sur-
gical precision against the African- 
American community. 
Our democracy is stronger when 
more people participate, and our poli-
cies are better when more people par-
ticipate, so we should be making it 
easier, not harder, to vote. Every eligi-
ble American should be automatically 
registered to vote when one turns 18. 
That is a bill that I lead. If Target, 
which is my hometown company, can 
track a pair of shoes in Hawaii with a 
SKU number, if everyone gets a Social 
Security number, we should be able to 
make sure that people who are eligible 
to vote are automatically registered 
when they turn 18. 
So as to end the practice of gerry-
mandering, we also need to reform how 
we draw district maps by having an 
independent commission in each State. 
Certainly, we also need to ban the 
purging of voting rolls. As my friend 
Stacey Abrams has said, if you don’t go 
to church or the synagogue or the 
mosque for a year or so, you don’t lose 
your right to worship. If you don’t go 
to a PTA meeting or any other kind of 
Rotary Club or anything for a few 
years, you don’t lose your right to as-
semble under the U.S. Constitution, 
and if you have not voted in a few elec-
tions and show up when you have been 
registered but, somehow, they never 
sent you the notice and, because there 
is no same-day registration, you find 
out you cannot vote, even though you 
had been duly registered to vote, you 
should not lose your right to vote 
under the U.S. Constitution. That is 
exactly what is going on right now 
with voting purges. 
I am proud to lead provisions in the 
important For the People Act that 
would accomplish the goals to end 
these 
discriminatory 
practices. 
Of 
course, we also have to make voting 
more secure, which is my last topic. 
It has been 1,218 days since Russia at-
tacked us in 2016, and we have yet to 
pass comprehensive election security 
legislation. The next major elections 
are just 240 days away, and primaries, 
as we know, are underway. We must 
take action now to secure our elections 
from foreign threats. That is why I 
have championed legislation to beef up 
our election systems, which was in-
cluded in H.R. 1, by providing States 
with the resources to modernize our 
voting equipment—some of this has 
been passed here in this Chamber—but 
also to set standards for Federal elec-
tions, which is the key part—require-
ments like paper ballots and post-
election audits. We still have States— 
entire States—that have no backup 
paper ballots. 
I am not going to spend time going 
through all of those States, but let me 
tell you that the Russians know ex-
actly which States those are that have 
no backup paper ballots. We just had 
some caucuses in this country, and 
people resorted to looking at those 
paper ballots. Imagine if we were 
hacked in a certain county or in a cer-
tain State and there were no backup 
paper ballots. What would that do to a 
Federal election? 
These are the basics of a secure elec-
tion system, but in 2020, as I noted, 
voters in eight States will now cast 
their ballots on machines that produce 
no paper trails. There are 16 States 
that still have no statewide audit re-
quirements to confirm the results of an 
election, and a majority of States re-
lies on voting systems that are at least 
10 years old. That is wrong. 
That is why Senator LANKFORD and I, 
as well as Senator WARNER, Senator 
HARRIS, Senator BURR, and many oth-
ers, have been pushing the Senate to 
act, but we have been gut-punched be-
cause calls were made from the White 
House and calls were made from Sen-
ator MCCONNELL a year ago to stop the 
votes to get that bill through the com-
mittee to the Senate floor. 
Making voting easier and more se-
cure is only part of the solution. We 
also have to get dark money out of our

politics 
and 
increase 
transparency. 
Americans know this. They know there 
is way too much dark money in our 
politics. In poll, after poll, after poll, 
they overwhelmingly want to have 
more transparency. Campaign finance 
reform is a central part of H.R. 1 for a 
reason. If we don’t put a check on the 
corrupting influence of money in poli-
tics, American voices will continue to 
be drowned out by special interests. 
Think about the three things I have 
just proposed: making voting easier, 
securing our election systems, and get-
ting Big Money out of our campaigns. 
These are not radical proposals. These 
are proposals on which nearly everyone 
in our country agrees. 
I conclude by noting, in addition to 
marking the 1-year anniversary of the 
passage of H.R. 1 in the House, today is 
Harriet Tubman Day. Most people re-
member Harriet Tubman for her in-
credible work on the Underground 
Railroad, where she repeatedly risked 
her life for the freedom of others. I re-
cently watched the movie ‘‘Harriet’’ 
and highly recommend it to my col-
leagues. Yet Harriet Tubman didn’t 
stop her fight for freedom and equality 
after the Civil War ended. She took up 
the cause of women’s suffrage and 
worked tirelessly until she was 90 years 
old in helping women get the right to 
vote. We celebrate her life today be-
cause she spent a lifetime bending the 
arc of our moral universe toward jus-
tice. 
The best way we can honor her and 
the countless others who have risked 
their lives for our country and our de-
mocracy is to continue the work of im-
proving our democracy so that it works 
better for the next generation. That is 
what the For the People Act is all 
about. 
I urge my Republican colleagues—I 
implore them—a group of people who I 
know believes in freedom—to allow us 
to have this bill come up for a vote to 
ensure that people have the cherished 
freedom to vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the opportunity to talk about 
this bill. 
I thank my colleague Senator UDALL, 
of New Mexico, and my colleague Sen-
ator MERKLEY, of Oregon, for their ex-
traordinary work. 
I don’t know if they have ever had 
the experience that I have often had or 
the Presiding Officer has had, but there 
are times, in my having spent a week 
here after having done absolutely noth-
ing, when I am walking through the 
Denver International Airport, and I 
want to put a paper bag over my head 
because I am so embarrassed about the 
failure of this institution to live up to 
even the barest responsibilities that we 
have. 
I mean, we can’t even pass a basic in-
frastructure bill around this place 
while China is building 3,500 miles of 
fiber-optic cable to connect Latin 
America with Africa and back to China 
to export the surveillance state from 
China. That is what China is doing 
there while we are doing nothing here. 
We have become the land of flickering 
lights, whereby the standard of success 
is whether we have kept the lights on 
for another 2 hours or another 4 hours. 
What the American people need to 
understand is that this is the ideolog-
ical end state of what the Freedom 
Caucus came to Washington to do. It 
has become the ideological end state of 
what MITCH
MCCONNELL
can do be-
cause, in the rubble of our institutions, 
they can achieve the objectives they 
want to achieve. They can put right-
wing judges on the courts without our 
institutions working. They can come 
out here and cut taxes for rich people 
and claim it is a middle-class tax cut 
without our institutions working. Yet 
what we are unable to do without those 
institutions working is invest in our 
infrastructure, is make sure that we 
have an education system in this coun-
try that is actually liberating people 
from their economic circumstances in-
stead of reinforcing their economic cir-
cumstances, is ensure that we are 
doing something on the climate and 
doing something on guns. 
It has been more than 20 years since 
Columbine happened in Colorado. My 
State—the Western State, a Second 
Amendment State—passed background 
checks after Columbine. My three 
daughters grew up knowing they lived 
in a State that was actually trying to 
respond to what was going on in their 
schools—not true of the U.S. Congress. 
The reason for much of this inaction 
is the Supreme Court’s decision with 
regard to Citizens United. I will not be-
labor the point, for I know my col-
league from Hawaii was kind to let me 
go ahead of her, but let me just repeat 
this: After Citizens United, 10 donors 
over the past decade have contributed 
$1.2 billion to our policy. That has cre-
ated a corruption of inaction in the 
U.S. Senate. It is not corruption that 
you see because it is a corruption of in-
action. It is the bill that is not intro-
duced. It is the committee hearing that 
is not held. It is the vote that is never 
taken for fear that, if you do that, 
some billionaire is going to drop $30 
million on your race and run a primary 
against you in your next election. 
Do you want to know why we can 
have a Senate in the United States 
that votes on only 22 amendments in a 
year? That is the reason. Do you want 
to know why we have a Senate wherein 
75 percent of the votes are personnel 
votes and 25 percent are actually on 
amendments? That is the reason. We 
have to overcome it, not for Democrats 
or Republicans but for the American 
people because this is their exercise in 
self-government. This is the way they 
make decisions. 
I know these reforms can work be-
cause they have worked in Colorado 
with a bipartisan commission to end 
gerrymandering, mail-in voting, and 
automatic and same-day voting reg-
istration. The result is that we have 
the second highest voter participation 
rate in America. How can that not be 
good for our democracy? 
So my hope is that at some point, 
when he hears the voices of the Amer-
ican people, MITCH MCCONNELL will re-
lent and allow these bills to come to 
the floor. 
He described this bill last year as a 
power grab—a power grab—and I will 
accept that if it is understood that it is 
a power grab by the American people, 
which is what it is—an effort to get 
money out of our politics and to put 
people back into our politics so we can 
start doing the work that the Amer-
ican people sent us here to do. 
With that, I thank my colleague from 
Hawaii again for her indulgence. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
also want to thank Senators Udall and 
Merkley for their extraordinary work 
on the For the People Act. 
We are confronting a crisis in our de-
mocracy. We have a President who re-
peatedly invites foreign intervention in 
our elections, engages in widespread 
corruption, attacks the news media as 
part of a broader assault on the truth, 
and uses false claims of voter fraud to 
legitimize voter suppression across the 
country. 
These challenges to our democracy 
are not limited to the Trump adminis-
tration, but this President has un-
doubtedly made things much, much 
worse. It is why I joined an over-
whelming number of my Democratic 
colleagues of both Chambers of Con-
gress in cosponsoring H.R. 1, the For 
the People Act. 
This crucial piece of legislation is 
the most expansive and serious at-
tempt to strengthen American democ-
racy in decades. Among its many provi-
sions, this bill would root out corrup-
tion by attacking the dark money in 
our politics. The door was opened in 
the Citizens United decision by the Su-
preme Court. This bill would also se-
cure our elections from foreign inter-
ference and restore voter protections 
that Republicans have spent decades 
attacking for their own partisan polit-
ical benefit. 
Like many of my colleagues, I am 
particularly focused on combating the 
Republican 
Party’s 
efforts 
to 
dis-
enfranchise millions of minority vot-
ers. I could spend hours detailing the 
efforts throughout American history to 
make it as difficult as possible—or 
even impossible—for people of color to 
vote. 
But today I want to focus on the im-
pact of the Supreme Court’s 2013 deci-
sion in Shelby County. In this 5-to-4 
decision, Chief Justice Roberts and the 
Court’s conservative Justices effec-
tively gutted the core protections of 
the Voting Rights Act. They decided 
that States with long histories of dis-
crimination no longer had to obtain 
Federal approval for voting changes 
under the Voting Rights Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1654 
March 10, 2020 
As author Carol Anderson explained, 
Chief 
Justice 
Roberts 
has 
‘‘[l]ong 
[been] an opponent of the Voting 
Rights Act,’’ and in Shelby County he 
used arguments that had been ‘‘care-
fully crafted’’ over ‘‘several decades’’ 
to eviscerate the Voting Rights Act. 
Without the constraints of the Vot-
ing Rights Act, States with long his-
tories of discrimination ramped up 
voter suppression, from racist voter ID 
laws to eliminating early voting, to 
purging voter rolls and closing polling 
places. 
In the 6 years following the Shelby 
County decision, for example, States 
previously subjected to preclearance 
under the Voting Rights Act closed at 
least 1,688 polling sites. Texas alone 
closed 750 polling places. 
The closures had their intended ef-
fect. A study at Harvard University 
found that minority voters are six 
times more likely than White voters to 
wait longer than an hour to vote. 
Longer waits impose greater costs for 
voting on minorities and deter them 
from voting in future elections. We saw 
the impact of these policies just last 
week on Super Tuesday, which saw in-
ordinately long lines in minority pre-
cincts in Texas. 
Mr. Hervis Rogers waited more than 
6 hours to vote, but he was determined 
to make his voice heard. So when he 
got to his polling place at Texas South-
ern University, a historically Black 
college in Houston, he patiently waited 
in line until he could cast his vote at 
1:30 in the morning. 
Mr. Rogers’s experience last week 
speaks to one part of a broader prob-
lem. The Republican Party is so in-
vested in voter suppression because 
they view it as an effective tool to win 
elections, and these efforts had dev-
astating consequences for our country 
in the 2016 Presidential election—the 
first Presidential election held in 50 
years that did not have the protections 
of the Voting Rights Act. 
We saw plummeting minority turn-
out across the country, including in 
the key swing States of Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, and Wisconsin. 
Carol Anderson observed that in 2016, 
50,000 fewer people voted in 1—just 1— 
overwhelmingly 
African-American 
county in Wisconsin. Donald Trump, by 
comparison, won Wisconsin by only 
27,000 votes. 
Efforts to further suppress the mi-
nority vote in swing States continue to 
date. Last year, for example, a conserv-
ative interest group sued Wisconsin’s 
State Elections Commission to force a 
purge of 209,000 infrequent voters from 
the voter rolls. Although a lower State 
court granted the conservative group’s 
request, a Wisconsin appeals court put 
the voter purge on hold while the fight 
in court continues. 
These ongoing voter suppression ef-
forts serve as stark reminders of why 
we need to pass the For the People Act. 
This bill not only blocks common 
strategies Republicans have used to 
make it harder for minorities to vote, 
but it also includes critical democracy 
reforms to make their votes count. 
This legislation would also set strong 
national standards to protect voting 
access that reflect and improve upon 
steps that have already been taken by 
States like Hawaii. Last year, for ex-
ample, Hawaii became the fourth State 
in the country to provide mail-in bal-
lots to all voters. Our State also has 
same-day 
voter 
registration, 
preregistration for residents under the 
age of 18, and a 10-day early voting pe-
riod. 
While some States are stepping up to 
protect voting rights, Congress needs 
to take strong and decisive action to 
restore voting rights and end voter 
suppression across the country. 
We also need to take an equally 
strong stand against Donald Trump’s 
efforts to pack our Federal courts with 
judges who have dedicated their ca-
reers to undermining the voting rights 
of minorities. 
At the Supreme Court, where Donald 
Trump has appointed two Justices, 
there have been a number of cases at-
tacking the voting rights of minority 
communities, and there are real con-
cerns that the Roberts Court will con-
tinue to uphold these voter suppression 
efforts. 
In the lower courts, Trump judges in-
clude Andrew Brasher, now an Elev-
enth Circuit judge, who argued in sup-
port of gutting the Voting Rights Act 
in the Shelby County case; and Kyle 
Duncan, now a Fifth Circuit judge, who 
defended North Carolina’s discrimina-
tory voting law that the Fourth Circuit 
found—and I quote the Fourth Cir-
cuit—‘‘target[ed] 
African 
Americans 
with almost surgical precision.’’ These 
are overt acts to suppress voting. 
President Trump’s hostility to voting 
rights is so extreme. He is appointing 
anti-voting rights advocates even to 
courts that do not handle voting 
issues, such as Stephen Schwartz for 
the Court of Federal Claims and Ste-
phen Vaden for the Court of Inter-
national Trade. Both have no experi-
ence with these courts, but both have 
defended North Carolina’s discrimina-
tory voting law. 
The right to vote is one of our most 
sacred rights, and we must do all that 
we can to protect it for all Americans. 
That is why I will continue to fight 
back against Donald Trump’s court 
packing and fight for the passage of 
critical legislation like the For the 
People Act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
am pleased to be here with my col-
leagues to fight to restore the Amer-
ican Constitution. I am pleased to be 
here with Senator TOM UDALL, who has 
led the For the People Act, and my col-
leagues MAZIE HIRONO, MICHAEL BEN-
NET, AMY KLOBUCHAR, and DICK DUR-
BIN—all speaking up to say that we 
must defend the American Constitu-
tion. 
At the root of that is our system of 
electing those who represent us, and 
that election system, America, is now 
deeply corrupted by gerrymandering, 
by extensive, persistent voter suppres-
sion, and by dark money. It affects ev-
erything that we should achieve for the 
people of the United States. 
If we believe we need to end the price 
gouging of Americans on pharma-
ceutical drugs, we need to end this cor-
ruption and pass the For the People 
Act. If we believe that every child de-
serves a quality K–12 education and 
that our children should be able to go 
to college without a mountain of debt, 
we need to end this corruption and pass 
the For the People Act. If we believe 
that Americans should be living in 
homes and apartments, not sleeping on 
the streets, we need to end this corrup-
tion and pass the For the People Act. If 
we believe that we have a responsi-
bility to pass on a habitable and livable 
planet, free of pollution, to our chil-
dren and grandchildren, we need to end 
this corruption and pass the For the 
People Act. 
This 
corruption—gerrymandering, 
voter suppression, dark money—is all 
about eviscerating the very soul of our 
Constitution—the ‘‘we the people’’ vi-
sion of our Constitution, that we would 
not be like European nations that had 
government by and for the powerful, 
but that here in America representa-
tives of the people would be able to 
have government by and for the people. 
It is Jefferson who said: The real test 
of whether we succeed is whether the 
laws reflect the will of the people. But 
instead, we see the laws in this Cham-
ber being constructed solely, uniquely, 
and, unfortunately for the most power-
ful and wealthy among us rather than 
the people. 
Gerrymandering, where voters should 
choose their politicians but, instead, 
politicians choose their voters—that is 
a deep and powerful corruption that 
has extensive impact on the Chamber 
that is just down the hall. 
We have seen what happened in 
North Carolina, where 47 percent of the 
State’s popular vote in House races 
won 23 percent of the seats and, simi-
larly, in Pennsylvania, in the election 
before last, and the Supreme Court 
threw up its hands and said: We can’t 
do anything about this, even though 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court un-
derstood it is so important to fairness 
and equal representation and took it 
on and solved it. 
This bill sets up independent com-
missions across the country so that the 
districts for representation are drawn 
fairly. 
Then there is voter suppression and 
intimidation. If you believe in our Con-
stitution and if you honor it, you be-
lieve in voter empowerment, not voter 
suppression. 
We have seen a flood of suppression 
and intimidation since the Supreme 
Court took a hatchet to the Voting 
Rights Act in the Shelby County case— 
voter ID laws, purges of voter rolls,

moving polling locations, cutting back 
on the hours, cutting back on the staff-
ing. We have seen it in North Dakota. 
We have seen it in Georgia. We have 
seen it in Ohio, and we have seen it in 
North Carolina. We have seen it in 
Iowa. We have seen it in New Hamp-
shire, and we saw it in Texas last week. 
There are strategies to keep the poor 
from voting, strategies to keep those 
Americans of minority communities 
from voting, strategies to keep Amer-
ican Native Indians from voting, and 
strategies to keep college students 
from voting. Talk about the intense 
and deliberate corruption of America. 
Voter suppression and intimidation is 
it. 
But this bill lays it out—automatic 
voter registration, national vote-by- 
mail, prohibiting the purging of voting 
rolls, online registration to enable peo-
ple to have a smooth, solid road to be 
able to participate, rather than road-
blocks and land mines to prevent them 
from participating. 
Then we have the dark money. These 
are the most powerful and richest 
Americans trying to drown out the 
voices 
of 
millions 
of 
Americans 
through 
unlimited dark and dirty 
money in our campaigns. Americans 
know the system is now rigged. They 
know it is now corrupted by this 
money. We have seen an explosion of 
this money since 2010 when the Citizens 
United decision came down, a 5-to-4 de-
cision from the Supreme Court. It 
bloated to more than $4.4 billion. 
This bill takes that on. It shines a 
light on all the money so we know 
where it is coming from and where it is 
going, so it can’t be hidden in a shell 
game from one level, to the next, to 
the next. It requires honest ads. It al-
lows 
small-donor 
matching 
grants. 
This bill, for the people, says no to cor-
ruption and yes to the ‘‘we the people’’ 
Constitution of the United States of 
America. 
If we want to act on the fundamen-
tals for families on healthcare, on 
housing, on education, on infrastruc-
ture, and on living-wage jobs; if we 
want to take on the Equality Act so 
doors are no longer slammed for the 
LGBTQ community; if we are going to 
take on the carbon pollution that is de-
stroying so much in American agri-
culture and our forests and our fishing, 
doing so much damage with fiercer 
storms; if we are going to take this on, 
we must pass the For the People Act. 
This act has passed the House down 
the hall. It has come down here, and it 
has been buried by the Republican 
leadership in this Chamber in, I must 
say, one of the most deliberate acts of 
sabotage of the Constitution we have 
ever seen on the floor of this Senate, 
and that sabotage must end. 
Therefore, Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 39, H.R. 1; that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed; and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). Is there objection? 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, I must 
admit I was sitting here, and I thought 
I was coming over for H.R. 1 from the 
House, which was attempted to be put 
on the floor—a bill that was supposedly 
designed to create ballot security—and 
I got here and found out that this is 
the bill that will right all wrongs. I had 
no idea that in one piece of legislation, 
so many things could happen. 
I understand also it is a bill that 
stops the subversion of the Constitu-
tion. I actually always thought a prin-
cipal purpose of our Constitution was 
to divide between the State and the 
Federal Government those things that 
could be better done by local govern-
ment and those things that could be 
better done by State government. That 
certainly is not what I heard today. 
I also thought that the reason for 
this bill supposedly from the House was 
a bill that would create a level of elec-
tion security that I never thought the 
bill would create, but I haven’t heard 
that. 
I almost went down to ask as my 
friend was finishing up, am I really 
here for H.R. 1, or is this some other 
bill that does so much more than I ever 
could have imagined that H.R. 1 could 
do? 
In March of 2019, the House did pass 
this bill. It gave unprecedented control 
to the Federal Government over the 
elections of the country. You take 
away—you moved as far as you pos-
sibly could, with this bill, the responsi-
bility for running an election at a pre-
cinct in a jurisdiction. 
At that time, the Senate requested 
that the bill be taken up, and it was 
objected to—by me, actually. In the in-
tervening year, the bill hasn’t changed. 
It appears to have gotten a lot better 
at what it might possibly be designed 
to do, which appears to be everything 
that anybody would ever want to deal 
with, but what it really does is it still 
represents a one-size-fits-all Federal 
power grab to take control of election 
administration away from the States 
and in most cases away from the com-
munity and in many cases away from a 
locally elected official whose—the very 
essence of the job they have been elect-
ed to do is to be sure that not only can 
people vote but that people have con-
fidence in what happens on election 
day. That, in my view, would change 
dramatically if you move that respon-
sibility from the people who have it 
now to some group here in Washington, 
DC, who would try to administer elec-
tions nationally. 
I am confident that wouldn’t happen. 
In fact, the security of our elections— 
since the impetus of this was supposed 
to be more secure elections when the 
House first said they were going to 
pass a big election bill that ensures 
elections will be more secure, I think 
the thing that secures our elections the 
most is the diversity of the system. 
This bill would undermine the decen-
tralization of the system. It would un-
dermine the ability of local officials to 
be responsible. 
I spent 20 years as either the election 
official in the biggest county in our 
State where one person had that re-
sponsibility or as the secretary of 
state, the chief election official. I have 
been advised by and I have given advice 
to and I have worked with local elec-
tion officials who are incredibly moti-
vated to see that what happens on elec-
tion day is what voters want to have 
happen—the ability to cast their bal-
lots with minimum obstacles and with 
maximum confidence that what hap-
pened on election day was what voters 
intended to do. I think I understand 
how hard those election officials work 
and everything they do to ensure that 
voters will be heard. 
It is not just my opinion. President 
Obama in 2016 said that ‘‘there is no se-
rious person out there who would sug-
gest somehow that you could even rig 
America’s elections, in part because 
they are so decentralized and the num-
ber of votes involved.’’ I actually agree 
with that. I think that was right then, 
and I think that is right now. 
But this bill tells States how they 
could run every aspect of their elec-
tion. It takes away the authority of 
States to determine their own process 
in 
voter 
registration. 
It 
requires 
States—many States do this. If States 
do this and they think it works in their 
State, fine with me. But this would re-
quire online registration. It would re-
quire automatic voter registration. It 
would require same-day registration. If 
we were concerned about access to the 
voter rolls, none of those things would 
be things that from Washington, DC, 
we would believe we could require. It 
requires the criteria of how you process 
how a voter can be removed from the 
voter rolls. It tells States what kind of 
election equipment they must use. It 
tells States how their ballots have to 
be counted. It tells States how their 
ballots have to be audited. It even goes 
so far as to tell States what kind of 
paper their ballots have to be printed 
on. 
That is exactly what happens when 
you decide you are going to make 
something better by making one big 
one-size-fits-all system. Nothing is too 
small for that system to decide they 
can do better than anybody locally 
could decide, even what paper the bal-
lot is printed on. 
This doesn’t stop at that, though. It 
changes Federal campaign finance law. 
It includes politicizing the Federal 
Elections Commission by changing it 
from an evenly divided number to a 
partisan, 
five-member 
Commission 
where three members would always be 
of the opposite party from the other 
two. It creates a program for public fi-
nancing of Federal elections, which

March 10, 2020 
was just described as ‘‘grants to politi-
cians’’—the most ingenious description 
I have heard of giving tax money to 
politicians to run elections. It would be 
a grant to politicians. 
This bill hasn’t changed since last 
March, but a lot has changed since last 
March. The Intelligence Committee 
that I am a member of has released 
three volumes of its report on Russian 
interference in the 2016 election. Those 
three volumes include numerous rec-
ommendations to combat foreign elec-
tion interference in our elections. The 
vast majority of those recommenda-
tions are not in this law. Many of those 
recommendations have been passed by 
the Senate and not passed by the 
House. 
We are going to have a briefing in 
just about 50 minutes from the FBI, 
the Homeland Security people, and the 
people who are actually working to se-
cure our elections so that every Sen-
ator can hear what is happening there. 
None of that is in this bill. 
State and local officials have moved 
dramatically since 2016 to upgrade 
their systems. All but two States, I be-
lieve, now have largely moved to where 
they have an auditable paper trail, 
which I was always insisting upon as a 
State election official. States are mov-
ing in that direction. They are chang-
ing their own laws. Federal officials 
are giving them advice when they need 
it but not trying to take over. 
This bill not only doesn’t acknowl-
edge what State and local officials 
have been doing, but it actually under-
mines what they have been doing by 
setting standards that the brandnew 
equipment might not fit—equipment 
that has a paper trail, equipment that 
States had just bought, equipment 
they bought that they think would do 
a better job but might not be in full 
compliance with this new law. 
There certainly are things that the 
Federal Government can do to assist, 
particularly in securing local elections 
and giving advice to local election offi-
cials. H.R. 1 does not do most of those 
things. It doesn’t meet the standard 
that it sets for itself. It doesn’t address 
the actual challenges in elections. So, 
Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
my colleague has just demonstrated 
why this bill should be on the floor. He 
has given extensive conversation on a 
series of points that should be delib-
erated upon. 
I say to my colleague from Missouri, 
isn’t this what we should be doing as a 
body, putting issues on the floor of the 
Senate and debating them for the fu-
ture of this country so that we can get, 
if you will, right to the facts rather 
than to have things obscured by the 
fact that the issue is not on the floor. 
So I would encourage my colleague 
from Missouri to go back to his caucus 
and say: You know, I just gave a vig-
orous opposition to this bill, but I be-
lieve in the role of the Senate in delib-
erating the issues. So I think this bill 
should be put on the floor, and I think 
it should be open to amendments. 
I can hear from what my colleague 
has stated that he probably thinks the 
bill should be shrunk and probably 
thinks it could also be expanded. Good. 
That is the point of having debate and 
amendments on the floor of the Senate. 
So I would hope, in the spirit of your 
comments, you would be willing to ac-
tually stand up and debate this bill and 
advocate for your colleagues to debate 
this bill on the floor of the Senate, be-
cause once upon a time, this floor 
would have been full of Members argu-
ing over key issues, enlightening each 
other, pointing out the flaws in their 
thinking, but now substantive policy 
bills don’t arrive here on the floor be-
cause of an unconstitutional position— 
one that is not delineated in the Con-
stitution—the majority leader has de-
cided that nothing should be debated 
on this floor that he alone doesn’t want 
considered. 
Let’s think about some of the points 
that were just raised. One point was 
that the Federal Government should 
have no role in elections; it should all 
be left to local officials. Didn’t we have 
that debate in 1965 in the Voting 
Rights Act? Why did the Federal Gov-
ernment say that we should, in fact, 
have laws for the integrity of our elec-
tions? It was because there were all 
kinds of forms of voter intimidation 
and voter suppression, keeping the peo-
ple of the United States, the citizens of 
the United States, from fully partici-
pating in their democratic Republic. It 
is the Constitution that laid out this 
role for the Federal Government, say-
ing Congress may at any time by law 
make or alter such regulations regard-
ing elections. So it is the Constitution 
that envisioned that if States failed to 
protect the integrity of our elections, 
then we should act right here, right 
now. 
My colleague said he didn’t like the 
idea that the bill says what type of 
paper to use. Well, that’s certainly 
something that can be worked out. But 
shouldn’t we have paper ballots every-
where? 
My colleague said local officials are 
doing a great job. Then why were peo-
ple in minority districts waiting 7 
hours to vote, when people in many 
other 
districts—more 
affluent 
dis-
tricts—were waiting 7 minutes to vote? 
That is discrimination, straight and 
simple. Shouldn’t we debate elimi-
nating that discrimination here on the 
floor of the Senate? 
This is about the integrity of our 
elections. This is about the vision of 
our Constitution. This is about not let-
ting the wealthy and powerful control 
what happens in our United States of 
America. 
If we do not address this corruption 
of this Senate and of the voting insti-
tutions, then we, in fact, will fail to 
fulfill our responsibility under the Con-
stitution of the people, by the people, 
and for the people. 
Thank you, Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
AUSTRALIAN WILDFIRES 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to honor the 
alliance we have between America and 
Australia. Specifically, I want to pay 
tribute to the partnership we have with 
regard to firefighting. America’s cen-
tury-old friendship with Australia has 
safeguarded two great nations. 
July of 2018 marked the 100th anni-
versary of our historic victory in the 
pivotal Battle of Hamel during World 
War I. The Australia, New Zealand, 
United States Security Treaty came 
together to cement this military alli-
ance. Since that treaty was signed in 
1951, we have always supported each 
other in times of crisis. It is this en-
during spirit of mutual concern and co-
operation and commitment that we 
celebrate today. 
Senator BEN CARDIN of Maryland and 
I have put together a bipartisan resolu-
tion paying tribute to our firefighting 
alliance. 
In recent years, the United States 
and Australia have suffered some of the 
hottest, driest weather on record. As a 
result, we have seen longer, fiercer 
wildfire seasons. For over 15 years, the 
two nations have come together to bat-
tle some of the most damaging and 
deadly fires. In 2018, more than 100 Aus-
tralians helped the United States com-
bat wildfires ravaging the West Coast. 
For our part, U.S. agencies have been 
sending American firefighters to help 
the people of Australia. These agencies 
include the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, the Forest Service, the National 
Park Service, the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs, and the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice. 
Most recently, 362 firefighters helped 
battle this season’s brutal Australian 
brush fires. These brush fires burned 
over 30 million acres before the last 
fires were put out just this month. 
Tragically, three former American 
servicemembers died in a plane crash 
fighting the wildfires in Australia. One 
of these heroes, Ian McBeth of Mon-
tana, was actually a member of the 
Wyoming National Guard. Also killed 
were firefighters Paul Hudson of Ari-
zona and Rick DeMorgan of Florida. 
This resolution honors their ultimate 
sacrifice. It also recognizes the sac-
rifices of all of the courageous Amer-
ican and Australian firefighters. 
I especially want to thank the 15 fire-
fighters from my home State of Wyo-
ming who assisted Australia: Travis 
Braten, Anna Cressler, Peter Freire, 
Kyle Miller, Chris Rankin, Eldred 
Slagowski, 
Traci 
Weaver, 
Timothy 
Haas, Richard Howe, Frank Keeler, 
Robert McConchie, Shane McCormick, 
Heath Morgan, Rance Neighbors, and 
Jonathan Ziegler. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
complete list of all of the names of 
those U.S.-Australia brush fire fire-
fighters be printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
the fact is that America’s firefighters 
put their lives on the line every day to 
keep people safe. They do it here at 
home, and they do it when they go 
abroad. 
This resolution applauds the brave 
men and women who responded to the 
Australian people in their hour of need. 
It also promotes the sharing of critical 
resources, research, and best practices. 
This will help us prevent and suppress 
future fires. 
Be assured that the American-Aus-
tralian firefighting alliance will con-
tinue to protect us in the time of cri-
sis. Our bipartisan resolution cele-
brates this enduring partnership. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
HONORING IAN MCBETH 
Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator from Wyoming for 
his comments. I come here today to ex-
press some very similar ones. 
I come here today at a sad time—a 
sad time for Americans and especially 
a sad time for Montanans. You see, at 
the end of January, we lost three great 
Americans who paid the ultimate price 
for risking their lives for our allies 
down under. Those three great Ameri-
cans 
are 
Flight 
Engineer 
Rick 
DeMorgan, First Officer Paul Clyde 
Hudson, and Captain Ian McBeth, who 
is a Montanan. They all lost their lives 
when their plane went down fighting a 
devastating bush fire in Australia. 
Captain McBeth lived in Great Falls, 
MT. He was a dedicated pilot and serv-
icemember. He was a member of both 
the Montana and the Wyoming Air Na-
tional Guards and he completed several 
combat deployments, including tours 
in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
Captain McBeth was one of the best 
pilots Montana had to offer. It was as if 
he was born to fly C–130s. But even 
more, he was born to be a caring fa-
ther, husband, brother, and son to the 
incredible family he has left behind. At 
44 years of age, he was taken from 
them far too young. 
Captain McBeth was devoted to his 
family, 
leaving 
behind 
his 
wife, 
Bowdie; his kids, Abigail, Calvin, and 
Ella; and his parents and siblings, 
whose hearts have to be aching right 
now. 
My wife Sharla and I are keeping 
them in our prayers and in our hearts 
through this trying time. 
Captain McBeth heard the call to 
serve this country and did so honor-
ably, taking that call to duty even fur-
ther to help the folks in need on the 
other side of the world to fight 
wildfires. 
Now, Montanans are no stranger to 
the risks that come from fighting 
wildfires, but that doesn’t make it any 
easier when we lose one of our own. 
Captain McBeth and so many other 
Montanans who bravely run into dan-
ger when others run out—these are our 
heroes, plain and simple. We owe a debt 
of gratitude to Captain McBeth that 
can never be repaid. Montana has lost 
one of its finest, and he will be missed. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I suggest 
the absence of a quorum.

Ms. MCSALLY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

HONORING PAUL HUDSON 
Ms. MCSALLY. Madam President, 
last week, I cosponsored a bipartisan 
resolution honoring the three Amer-
ican firefighters who lost their lives 
fighting Australia’s bush fires this 
year, including First Officer Paul Hud-
son, from Buckeye, AZ. Each of these 
men gave the ultimate sacrifice in 
service to others. 
Paul dedicated his life to protecting 
others, first as a marine and then as a 
firefighter. He served in the Marine 
Corps for 20 years, including as a C–130 
pilot, before retiring as a lieutenant 
colonel. Paul graduated from the Naval 
Academy in 1999 and later went on to 
earn a master’s degree in business ad-
ministration and information tech-
nology management from the Naval 
Postgraduate School. 
When aid was needed in Australia to 
combat the devastating wildfires, Paul 
jumped into action and put his life on 
the line to help others. He was only 42 
years old when he was killed in a plane 
crash while fighting to extinguish 
these awful fires. My heart and my 
prayers, and Arizona’s heart and Arizo-
na’s prayers, go out to his wife, Noreen, 
and her loss. Arizona will not forget 
Paul’s immense selflessness and his 
sacrifice.

PROVIDING FOR CONGRESSIONAL 
DISAPPROVAL UNDER CHAPTER 
8 OF TITLE 5, UNITED STATES 
CODE, OF THE RULE SUBMITTED 
BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDU-
CATION 
RELATING 
TO 
‘‘BOR-
ROWER 
DEFENSE 
INSTITU-
TIONAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY’’—MO-
TION TO PROCEED 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in just a 
few moments, we are going to be con-
sidering the motion to proceed to the 
borrower CRA, and I would like to say 
a few words, understanding that the 
Senators are expecting this motion to 
come up in about 5 minutes. 
This is a joint resolution that was 
passed on a bipartisan basis in the 
House of Representatives to overturn 
the borrower defense rule that has been 
promulgated by Department of Edu-
cation Secretary Betsy DeVos. I am 
pleased to be the Senate’s sponsor. 
Here is what it comes down to—hun-
dreds of thousands of Federal student 
loan borrowers having been defrauded 
by their schools. They went to some of 
these for-profit schools that have gone 
out of business, but many schools de-
frauded these students over the years. 
We in Congress established what was 
known as the borrower defense. We 
said, if you borrow money from the 
Federal Government and go to colleges 
that we acknowledge as being accred-
ited and they defraud you, lie to you, 
misrepresent to you what your edu-
cation is going to cost or what it is 
going to give you, then, you don’t have 
to be saddled with the student debt for 
the rest of your life because of their 
lies, because of their fraud. You have a 
chance to go to the Department of Edu-
cation and plead your case that you 
were defrauded, and you should at least 
be relieved of some, if not all, of your 
student loan debt. That is what it is all 
about. 
There are 230,000 student borrowers 
who are waiting for the Department of 
Education, under Betsy DeVos, to do 
something. The Department has not 
done anything except to come up with 
a new rule that says, at this point, it is 
going to be harder for these students to 
prove fraud. It isn’t enough that the 
States and other units of government 
have found fraud by these schools. 
These students are supposed to be their 
own lawyers and their own investiga-
tors and prove the fraud and how it af-
fected them personally. 
Is it reasonable for a young student 
who has been defrauded and is carrying 
student debt to have that responsi-
bility? Secretary DeVos thinks yes. I 
think no. That is what this vote is all 
about. 
Who agrees with my position on this 
issue? Most of the advocates for stu-
dents do. In addition, the veterans or-
ganizations across America, led by the 
American Legion, are supporting our 
effort now under this Congressional Re-
view Act to do away with the new rule 
by the Secretary of the Department of 
Education. They say it is unfair to vet-
erans—it is—and unfair to student bor-
rowers to hold them to this standard. 
The American Legion’s national com-
mander, Bill Oxford, called the rule, 
which we are going to get a chance to 
vote on after the debate, ‘‘fundamen-
tally rigged against defrauded bor-
rowers.’’ He is speaking on behalf of 
veterans. He could be speaking on be-
half of young men and women across 
America who have been misled by these 
schools over and over again. The Bipar-
tisan 
Policy 
Center 
Action, 
the 
NAACP, Third Way, 20 State attorneys 
general, and a host of others have 
joined me in urging the Senate to over-
turn this unfair rule. 
The Senate has a chance today to 
show the country that we can come to-
gether and do the right thing for stu-
dents and veterans. How many times 
have we given speeches about how 
much we care about veterans? Here is a 
chance to vote with the veterans, espe-
cially those who have been defrauded 
out of their GI bill of rights and have 
ended up with additional debt. 
Secondly, how many times have peo-
ple told us these student debts are too 
much, are ruining kids’ lives, and to 
give them a chance? I am not for for-
giving all loans to all students, but 
these students have been defrauded. 
They should have an opportunity to 
start life again and not be burdened 
with the debt that is going to make life 
impossible in their futures.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1659 
March 10, 2020 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle will join me. Regardless of 
what you think of the 2016 rule, we can 
certainly do better than what Sec-
retary DeVos has come up with. 
I have been advised that we are not 
quite ready for my request of the 
Chair. So I will say a couple of more 
words on the subject. I moved it along 
quickly, but I didn’t have to. 
Under the new Betsy DeVos rule, it 
turns out that, of the 100 percent of 
students who have been defrauded and 
are asking for relief, the estimate is 
that 3 percent will be successful but 
that 97 percent of these students will 
not have the opportunity to get this re-
lief. 
One of my colleagues whom I respect 
very much came to the floor here and 
said: If your car is a lemon, you don’t 
sue the bank; you sue the dealer. A col-
lege can be a lemon just like a car can 
be. In his scenario, the school is the 
dealer, and the Department of Edu-
cation is the bank. The case that he is 
making for a student who has been de-
frauded by a school is that one has 
been sold a lemon of an education and 
that we should go after the offending 
school. 
Doesn’t that sound right—that, if a 
school has defrauded you, you would go 
after it? 
It turns out that the rule that Sec-
retary DeVos has promulgated ties the 
hands of a student who is going after 
the school. It requires forced, manda-
tory arbitration. So you can’t take it 
to court. It eliminates class actions so 
that students from the same school, 
like the Corinthian Colleges, which 
went bankrupt, can’t even come to-
gether as a class. No, you have to law-
yer up individually. You have to get 
ready to fight in some room that has 
been set aside in which the for-profit 
school and the Department of Edu-
cation are going to argue against you. 
Is that what we want to say to these 
students who have been through bad 
college experiences and want to get on 
with their lives, who found out that 
these credit hours from these for-profit 
colleges didn’t transfer anywhere, and 
who found out the courses that were 
supposed to lead to jobs didn’t lead to 
jobs? 
These students were misled by these 
schools, and these schools are noto-
rious for it. The question is this: Are 
we going to stand up for the students, 
many of whom are veterans, or are we 
going to stand up for the schools that 
have been affected by this? 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I rise 
in support of S.J.Res. 56, a resolution 
of congressional disapproval for the De-
partment of Education’s, Borrower De-
fense Institutional Accountability rule. 
It is inconceivable to me that the 
Federal 
Department 
of 
Education 
would choose to protect the profits of 
predatory corporations instead of the 
students they ripped off, but sadly, 
that is exactly what Secretary DeVos’s 
borrower defense regulation does. It is 
now up to Congress to step in and re-
verse the harm that her Department is 
seeking to do. 
Four years ago, the Obama adminis-
tration took action when it became 
clear that a number of for profit col-
leges were defrauding students, leaving 
them on the hook for massive loans 
without an education or a job. The bor-
rower defense rule established under 
President Obama made sure that stu-
dents who had been hurt by these 
schools could access debt relief and get 
a chance at restarting their education. 
Unfortunately, Secretary DeVos chose 
to gut that regulation, making it near-
ly impossible for defrauded students to 
get any kind of debt relief from the 
loans they took out to attend colleges 
that were later found to be bad actors. 
To make matters worse, Secretary 
DeVos also rescinded existing protec-
tions and ended forgiveness pathways 
that were included in the 2016 borrower 
defense rule. Secretary DeVos took 
what was a fair and transparent proc-
ess and rigged the deck against stu-
dents. 
Because of the new barriers to debt 
relief established by Secretary DeVos’s 
new borrower defense rule, only an es-
timated 3 percent of loans associated 
with school misconduct will be dis-
charged. The DeVos rule eliminates the 
ability for borrowers to file for relief in 
groups and requires individuals to meet 
an unreasonably high standard of evi-
dence that the school intended to mis-
lead them. In addition, the rule only 
gives borrowers 3 years from the time 
they leave school to file a claim. In a 
large number of previous cases, it has 
taken many years to gather evidence of 
and establish fraud. Finally, the DeVos 
rule prohibits borrowers from appeal-
ing the decision on their claim, even if 
new evidence of a school’s misconduct 
comes to light. 
This new rule might be good for cor-
porate profits, but it will have a cruel 
impact on many vulnerable people who 
can afford it the least. I hear often 
from Connecticut residents who have 
been crippled by massive debt accrued 
while attending what turned out to be 
a valueless institution and who des-
perately need access to debt relief 
through a borrowers defense claim. 
I have heard from a number of stu-
dents in Connecticut who joined a law-
suit in the bankruptcy case of ITT 
Technical Institute after its closure 
left 40,000 students in limbo. Students 
described falsified job placement rates, 
lack of career connection with indus-
tries associated with their degree pro-
grams, unqualified teachers, and inac-
curate information about their loan 
terms. 
Meanwhile, the Department holds 
those with claims in financial limbo as 
they 
wait 
years 
for 
a 
decision. 
Natarsha 
Morales, 
who 
attended 
Briarwood College in Southington, CT, 
filed a claim on $39,000 in outstanding 
Federal student loans. Natarsha filed 
this claim nearly 4 years ago and has 
yet to receive a decision. During this 
time, Briarwood College, which later 
became Lincoln College, closed perma-
nently after a history of defrauding 
students like her. As the Department 
neither grants nor denies her request, 
the interest on her loans continues to 
grow. As a result, Natarsha has strug-
gled to plan for her financial future. 
She has been unable to buy a home and 
unable to enroll in another educational 
program. 
These students were just trying to do 
the right thing; they made sacrifices to 
try to get an education, better them-
selves, and get on a path to a better- 
paying career. Tragically, we now 
know that the degrees these students 
obtained—or sought to obtain—were 
worthless, and they were taken advan-
tage of by predatory institutions that 
cared only about taking as much 
money as possible. The least we can do 
for these students is to give them a 
chance at loan forgiveness. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of S.J.Res. 56 and repeal the DeVos 
Borrower Defense Institutional Ac-
countability rule that turns its back 
on borrowers and reduces the culpa-
bility of risky institutions. 
Mr. DURBIN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum.

Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I under-
stand there is a discharge petition at 
the desk for S.J. Res. 56 that has been 
signed by at least 30 Senators, which 
will cause the joint resolution to be 
discharged under the Congressional Re-
view Act; is that correct? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is. 
MOTION TO PROCEED 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I move 
to proceed to Calendar No. 439, S.J. 
Res. 56, a joint resolution providing for 
congressional disapproval under chap-
ter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of 
the rule submitted by the Department 
of Education relating to ‘‘Borrower De-
fense Institutional Accountability’’.

There is a sufficient second.

BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT ACCU-
RACY 
AND 
TECHNOLOGICAL 
AVAILABILITY ACT 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
rise 
in 
support 
of 
S. 
1822, 
the 
Broadband DATA Act, and in a mo-
ment I will make a unanimous consent 
request with regard to that legislation. 
This bill will ensure that the FCC has 
the most accurate broadband coverage 
maps in the world today to deploy 5G 
networks. As you know, we were in a 
race to win that race globally, and I 
think we can still do it. 
In 
December, 
the 
Senate 
unani-
mously passed this measure, S. 1822, 
but because the House passed a slightly 
amended version last week, we need to 
act again to get this bill across the fin-
ish line. 
We have a digital divide in this coun-
try which threatens to leave rural 
America behind. We have done a lot to 
address that divide. However, an esti-
mated 20 million Americans still lack 
access to broadband—Americans like 
those in Arizona or Mississippi or other 
States across our heartland. Every 
year, the FCC spends billions of dollars 
to promote deployment of broadband 
across the United States. S. 1822 will 
result in highly detailed and accurate 
maps so that the FCC can direct sup-
port to areas most in need. 
This legislation represents extensive 
negotiation and work on a bipartisan 
and bicameral basis, for which I con-
gratulate this Senate. My hat is off to 
our colleagues in the other body and 
thanks to all the staff who have helped 
on both sides of the aisle. 
Madam President, I ask the Chair lay 
before the Senate the message to ac-
company S. 1822. 
The Presiding Officer laid before the 
Senate the following message from the 
House of Representatives: 
Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 
1822) entitled ‘‘An act to require the Federal 
Communications Commission to issue rules 
relating to the collection of data with re-
spect to the availability of broadband serv-
ices and for other purposes.’’, do pass with an 
amendment. 
MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I 
move to concur in the House amend-
ment, and I ask unanimous consent 
that the motion be agreed to and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague, Senator 
DURBIN, for leading efforts this week to 
undo Betsy DeVos’s harmful rollback 
protections for millions of Americans 
with student loans ripped off by for- 
profit colleges. This is an example 
where the Senate stood up to the Presi-
dent, stood up to the billionaire Sec-
retary of Education whose mission in 
that job is to privatize public edu-
cation and turn profits for her and her 
friends and her allies. This bipartisan 
Senate stood up to her and stood up to 
the President, stood up to the majority 
leader, and did the right thing. 
We have seen these for-profit colleges 
in Ohio. Schools like Corinthian and 
ITT, which make big promises with 
fake—and this time the word ‘‘fake’’ is 
accurate—they make big promises with 
fake or deceptive job placement rates. 
They spend millions on marketing, and 
they trick students into taking out 
huge loans, only to close up shop and 
leave them with meaningless degrees 
or, worse yet, just credits but always 
mountains of debt. 
These are people trying to get an 
education to improve their job pros-
pects to build a better life for them-
selves and their families. Too often 
these predatory schools target Black 
students, Latino students, immigrants, 
low-income students, and first-genera-
tion college students. Many of them 
are veterans returning from serving 
our country and looking to start a new 
career. 
These for-profit colleges are willing 
to exploit people who have taken out 
loans to go there who are veterans. 
Sometimes they go to school. They 
served their country and then they go 
to school, and these for-profit colleges 
are willing to take advantage of them. 
These for-profit schools are all about 
lining the pockets of their CEOs. 
We need to stand with the defrauded 
student borrowers and hold these for- 
profit schools accountable. Of course, 
we have learned not to hold our breath 
when it comes to the Trump adminis-
tration holding anyone accountable— 
at least anyone rich accountable. In-
stead of figuring out how to provide re-
lief 
for 
students, 
Secretary 
Betsy 
DeVos went to work figuring out how 
to let the schools that scammed them 
off the hook. 
Three hundred thousand people had 
submitted borrower defense claims as 
of last December. More than 200,000 of 
those requests are still pending. More 
than 7,700 Ohioans—7,700 people in my 
State—are waiting for relief. 
In 2016, the Obama administration 
announced a rule to help these stu-
dents get their loans canceled, but the 
DeVos Department of Education—the 
Trump 
Department 
of 
Education— 
dragged its feet on processing borrower 
defense claims. They rewrote the rule 
to make it damn near impossible for 
defrauded students to get the relief 
they were promised. They are throwing 
up hurdle after hurdle: narrow time 
limits, making students gather all 
kinds of unnecessary paperwork, and 
banning students from appealing a de-
cision. 
DeVos’s rule opens up the doors for 
schools to once again use mandatory 
arbitration. I am not a lawyer, but I 
know from seeing this done to far too 
many of my constituents. Its legal fine 
print that for-profit schools sneak into 
their enrollment agreements deny stu-
dents their day in court. Students 
don’t know they are part of these 
agreements. They are, and they lose 
their day in court. 
I hear from Ohioans all the time who 
have been scammed by these schools.

this important issue. She is an Army 
veteran. She served our country with 
honor. She is a mother of four. She re-
turned 
home. 
She 
wanted 
to 
do 
forensics with the FBI, so she enrolled 
in ITT’s criminal justice program. She 
didn’t think of it as a for-profit school. 
She didn’t know she was about to get 
scammed. 
She had served our country. She 
wanted to serve our country. She went 
to this for-profit school. ITT told her 
that her GI benefits would cover the 
full tuition and that they would help 
her get a job after graduation. But 
when she began to suspect the program 
wasn’t the high-quality education that 
it claimed and tried to transfer, she 
found out that no other schools—no 
other legitimate schools—would accept 
her ITT credits. The supposedly high- 
tech school was using outdated books. 
Faced with a choice of continuing at 
ITT or starting completely over, she 
finished her degree. She ended up 
$100,000 in debt. Remember, ITT told 
her the GI bill would cover every-
thing—well, except for $100,000. She 
ended up $100,000 in debt with a degree 
that, unfortunately, employers didn’t 
take seriously. 
Those are the people whom Secretary 
DeVos and those are the people whom 
President Trump, with his own Trump 
University, want to take over our high-
er education system. 
Now she has lost her shot at using 
the GI benefit she earned, and she is 
drowning in debt. 
Ms. Berkhalter and other student 
veterans defrauded by shady schools 
deserve better than the treatment they 
are getting under Betsy DeVos. Not 
only is Betsy DeVos refusing to help, 
her new borrower defense rule will let 
other for-profit colleges continue to 
run the same scams on other students 
and student veterans. 
The Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau is supposed to crack down on 
these schools and on loan-servicing 
companies that handle people’s student 
loans. That is why we created the 
CFPB—to look out for people like Ms. 
Berkhalter. 
But 
under 
President 
Trump, under Betsy DeVos, they refuse 
to let the CFPB look into loan services 
that are scamming students. 
I asked the CFPB Director today 
about this. We have been asking her for 
a year to take this over and make it 
work. She continues to yield to her bil-
lionaire friend in the Cabinet, Sec-
retary DeVos, who is a billionaire 
friend of the billionaire President and 
has no interest in making him account-
able. President Trump’s CFPB Director 
is rolling over, refusing to do her job 
protecting the tens of millions of 
Americans with student loans. 
It comes back always to whose side 
you are on. Are you going to stand 
with student veterans, or are you going 
to stand with these for-profit CEOs, 
these CEOs of for-profit schools who 
are making literally millions of dollars 
a year? Are you going to fight for de-
frauded Americans saddled with stu-
dent loans or the shady schools ripping 
them off? It is pretty clear with whom 
President Trump and Betsy DeVos are 
standing. Over and over and over, 
President Trump and his administra-
tion betray the people he promised to 
fight for. 
I am glad my colleagues stood up 
today. It was a bipartisan victory. It 
said to President Trump and Betsy 
DeVos and Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL that that kind of fraud, that kind 
of exploitation of our veterans and our 
students who are defrauded by these 
for-profit colleges is something we will 
no longer accept. 
REMEMBERING NATHANIEL JONES 
Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I rise 
to honor a leader in the fight for jus-
tice, a great Ohioan whom we lost last 
month, Judge Nathaniel Jones. 
At a ceremony dedicating the Fed-
eral courthouse in honor of Judge 
Jones in 2003, former Congressman 
Louis Stokes said that the courthouse 
served as a testament to the out-
standing public service by ‘‘a local who 
made good.’’ Judge Jones certainly was 
that. 
Born in Youngstown in 1926, he 
served a country that did not yet rec-
ognize his full legal equality. He served 
his country in World War II. He went 
on to become a respected lawyer. He 
went on first to be a journalist who 
worked for the Youngstown and Pitts-
burgh News. He worked for the Youngs-
town newspaper. He covered Jackie 
Robinson when Jackie Robinson played 
in AAA and became a friend of his. He 
went on to become a respected lawyer, 
a Federal judge, and an international 
civil and human rights advocate. He 
was a local who made good, but more 
importantly, he was a man who did 
good. He committed his life to the pur-
suit of justice and equality. We are all 
the better for it. 
He led efforts to end employment dis-
crimination as the Executive Director 
of the Fair Employment Practices 
Commission. He was the first African- 
American U.S. attorney for the North-
ern District of Ohio. He served as As-
sistant General Counsel for President 
Johnson’s Kerner Commission. That 
Commission issued a landmark report 
warning that racism and poverty were 
the root causes of violence in our Na-
tion’s cities during the 1960s. 
As general counsel for the NAACP, 
Judge Jones directed efforts to fight 
discrimination faced by African-Amer-
ican soldiers and worked to deseg-
regate public schools in the North, 
stepping in personally to argue several 
cases. 
Nominated by President Carter, he 
was confirmed in 1979 to the Sixth Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals—one of only 39 
African Americans to ever serve on the 
Federal Circuit. As a judge, he felt it 
was his duty to be an instrument of 
change in a system that too often de-
nied justice to people of color. In many 
of the cases that came before the court, 
he so often sided with those taking on 
powerful interests and fighting for 
their rights—something we see far too 
little of in this body and in this gov-
ernment. 
As South Africa began to move be-
yond the dark days of apartheid and 
chart a new future of inclusion and 
equality, Judge Jones was called to 
help draft the country’s new Constitu-
tion. 
In Cincinnati, which he called home 
for some 45 years, the footprints of his 
good work can be seen across the city. 
Some of my favorite times were sitting 
in Judge Jones’s office and listening to 
him tell about his days as a reporter 
knowing 
Jackie 
Robinson, 
talking 
about his days at the NAACP, and talk-
ing about his belief in justice and his 
passion for fair play. 
He was one of the early supporters of 
the National Underground Railroad 
Freedom Center. He mentored numer-
ous young lawyers who served as his 
law clerks. He offered his assistance to 
local leaders seeking to address the lin-
gering stigma of racism still far too 
present in our society. Judge Jones was 
a brilliant legal thinker. He was a dog-
ged advocate for civil rights. 
Judge Jones was a wonderful husband 
and father. I am privileged to know 
well Stephanie, his daughter, who 
worked in the House of Representatives 
some years ago. He was a good friend, 
and he was a mentor to so many. He 
was also a relentless optimist who 
never—never—ceased to believe in the 
promise of our great country. 
The legacy of Judge Nathaniel Jones 
will live on through his far-reaching 
work for justice and through the many, 
many lives he touched. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, 
my colleague from Ohio just spoke 
about Nathaniel R. Jones, who was a 
circuit judge with the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Cincinnati and had 
a distinguished career as a judge but a 
long, distinguished career as a true 
champion of civil rights going back to 
the 1960s and was also general counsel 
of the NAACP when landmark cases 
were decided. I also happened to have 
had the privilege of getting to know 
him over the years and considered him 
a dear friend. 
We have a resolution that passed the 
Senate last month with regard to 
Judge Jones, and I am pleased to join 
my colleague SHERROD BROWN today in 
paying tribute again to Nathaniel R. 
Jones. That resolution is now in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD and therefore 
the agent for all of us to be able to un-
derstand the importance of the work he 
did and for future generations to un-
derstand the importance of the march 
to freedom that he represented.

S1662 
March 10, 2020 
GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT 
Madam President, I am also here on 
the floor today to highlight the intro-
duction of landmark new legislation 
called the Great American Outdoors 
Act. It is to ensure that some of our 
country’s greatest resources and our 
greatest treasures, including our na-
tional parks, are taken care of for gen-
erations to come. 
I am proud to help lead the introduc-
tion of this bill along with my col-
leagues 
Senator 
GARDNER, 
Senator 
MANCHIN, 
Senator 
DAINES, 
Senator 
WARNER, Senator ALEXANDER, and Sen-
ator KING. I also want to thank Presi-
dent Trump and his administration, 
first for President Trump’s support of 
the Restore Our Parks Act, which is 
part of this legislation, over the past 
few years but also for their support of 
this broader legislation, the Great 
American Outdoors Act. 
In the spirit of President Teddy Roo-
sevelt over 100 years ago, Federal land 
management agencies like the Na-
tional Park Service, the U.S. Forest 
Service, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, and others have worked to des-
ignate and preserve some of the most 
beautiful and historic parks of our 
country. Those lands, of course, in-
clude those we all know of as our na-
tional parks—Yosemite, Yellowstone, 
some of the great ones, Glacier—but 
also more modest sites like the boy-
hood home of President Taft in my 
home State of Ohio. 
In all, the National Park Service and 
its system include more than 84 million 
acres of parks and historical sites that 
now attract 330 million visitors annu-
ally. Actually, that is a record. More 
people are going to the parks than 
ever. That is great. The concern is, 
when they get to the parks, sometimes 
the parks aren’t working for them be-
cause of the huge infrastructure needs 
and the deferred maintenance prob-
lems. 
We have eight of these national parks 
in Ohio, including Cuyahoga Valley Na-
tional Park, which is our largest single 
park and actually is the 13th most vis-
ited national park in the country. It is 
a great park. Whether it is for biking, 
hiking, fishing, or kayaking, I am one 
of those 2.7 million visitors to Cuya-
hoga Valley National Park and Ohio’s 
national parks every year. I want to be 
sure these public lands are preserved so 
more Americans can visit these incred-
ible sites into the future. 
Going back to my days as the Direc-
tor of the Office of Management and 
Budget in the George W. Bush adminis-
tration—going back about a dozen 
years—I have taken the lead on fig-
uring out ways to help protect our na-
tional park sites throughout the coun-
try. At that time, we proposed—in the 
Bush administration—a centennial bill. 
We were coming up on the 100th anni-
versary of our national parks, and the 
notion was to get more public-private 
partnerships involved in the parks. 
President Bush and his Secretary of 
the Interior at the time were very sup-
portive of this effort, as was the Office 
of Management and Budget. 
After my time in the Bush adminis-
tration, I was a member of the Centen-
nial 
Commission 
on 
the 
National 
Parks, and here in the Senate, I am the 
author of what is called the National 
Park Service Centennial Act, which 
was signed into law in 2016, on the 
100th anniversary, to establish the Cen-
tennial Challenge Fund for the na-
tional parks. 
By the way, that Centennial Chal-
lenge Fund has done pretty well—$113 
million has been appropriated, but it 
has been leveraged by an additional 
$147 million from the private sector. So 
it has worked exactly as we intended it 
to—in fact, even better; it has been 
even more than a one-to-one match— 
the notion being, you put a challenge 
fund out there and say, if you care 
about the parks, the Federal taxpayer 
will put in some money, and you hope 
the private sector will also match it, 
and it has been more than matched. 
We also established the centennial 
endowment at what is called the Na-
tional Parks Foundation. This endow-
ment is intended to fund projects to ad-
dress things like deferred maintenance 
at our parks. Separately, that centen-
nial endowment has now $31.5 million 
in it. 
We know there is more work to do, 
though, to protect our national lands 
to ensure they are going to be there to 
enjoy for the future. The Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act will help us in mov-
ing forward with this mission through 
two main initiatives. 
First, it will permanently fund what 
is known as the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund through a provision of-
fered 
by 
Senators 
GARDNER
and 
MANCHIN—a $900 million initiative. The 
Land and Water Conservation Fund 
provides resources to State and local 
governments, as well as the Federal 
Government, to acquire land and water 
so that they can be protected. Often 
this is your city park back home, so 
sometimes it is neighborhood land. 
Sometimes it is land that connects to a 
national park or a national forest. 
Sometimes there is a checkerboard 
pattern of private ownership and public 
ownership, and it helps to connect 
those together to preserve some of our 
existing public lands. 
In any case, the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund has been successful 
over the years. Since its creation in 
1965, over $330 million in LCF funding 
has gone to protecting land in Ohio, as 
an example, and ensuring recreational 
access to those lands. 
The second part of this legislation is 
that, along with the LWCF, the Great 
American Outdoors Act includes our 
bipartisan Parks Act. It is called the 
Restore Our Parks Act. I authored this 
along with Senator WARNER, Senator 
KING, and Senator ALEXANDER. 
As I said, the parks and public lands 
are some of our greatest treasures in 
this country. The problem is that, over 
time, we have allowed this mainte-
nance backlog to build up, meaning 
that a lot of the buildings and infra-
structure, the roads, the bridges, and 
the water systems are deteriorating to 
the point that a lot of them are com-
pletely unusable. 
Again, it is great that a lot of folks 
are going to the parks now, but when 
they get there, sometimes the trail is 
closed, the bathroom is not working, 
and the visitor center has a leak in the 
roof and can’t be used. So it is time for 
us to put some funding into these de-
ferred maintenance expenses. Some 
would call them, perhaps, capital ex-
penses. 
Why has this happened? Well, be-
cause although every year we appro-
priate funding for the parks, the fund-
ing is for the operations of the park— 
for the nature programs, for the rang-
ers, for just the day-to-day activities— 
not for these infrastructure or capital 
expenses or what we call deferred 
maintenance. 
I have seen this firsthand in Ohio, 
where there is more than a $100 million 
backlog in long-delayed maintenance 
projects at our eight national park 
sites. Last fall I was at the Cuyahoga 
Valley National Park. I go there fre-
quently. It is a great park, but it badly 
needs more than $15 million in re-
pairs—renovations 
for 
shelters, 
for 
parking lots, for a bridge that is dan-
gerous to cross, for railroad tracks. 
There is a scenic railroad that runs 
through the Cuyahoga Valley National 
Park, but the railroad track is in such 
bad repair that it is dangerous—or will 
be soon—to go on that scenic railway. 
Trails have been falling apart because 
of erosion, and they don’t have enough 
money to do it. 
Let me give an example. The Cuya-
hoga Valley National Park has about 
an $11 million budget every year. So 
the taxpayers of America come to us 
here in Congress and say: Let’s fund 
our parks. We fund the parks for daily 
operations, and $11 million goes to 
Cuyahoga 
Valley 
National 
Park— 
again, the 13th most visited national 
park. It is a great park. There are a lot 
of visitors. It is sort of a suburban and 
in some places almost an urban park as 
well as a rural park. It is exactly what 
we need more of. A lot of kids access 
it—a lot of schoolkids. Well, the de-
ferred maintenance is over $50 million, 
so at $11 million a year, how do you 
pay for that deferred maintenance? 
That has been the challenge. 
Elsewhere in the State, I have toured 
Perry’s 
Victory 
and 
International 
Peace Memorial, which is on the shores 
of Lake Erie. This is at Put-in-Bay, so 
if you know Put-in-Bay—a famous spot 
for recreation, but the historic part of 
it is Perry’s Victory Monument. It was 
established under those who fought in 
the Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 
1812, as well as to celebrate the long- 
lasting peace between Britain, Canada, 
and the United States. So it is an im-
portant historical marker. 
There I saw some of the $48 million in 
long-delayed maintenance needs at the

site, which includes millions in needed 
repairs to fix a concrete seawall that is 
literally crumbling. The high-water 
level of Lake Erie has been part of the 
problem. Part of the problem is that it 
is just old, and it is crumbling. There 
are sinkholes around it. You are not al-
lowed to go near the seawall or there-
fore near the lake. The visitor center 
needs significant updates and needs to 
be made ADA accessible. The Ameri-
cans with Disabilities Act requires that 
they make it accessible, and they don’t 
have the funds to do that. 
In that case, there is a $48 million 
price tag to do the maintenance re-
pairs, and their annual budget is min-
uscule because it is a small park. It is 
a monument with a small visitor cen-
ter. Yet they have this huge expense. 
I have also been to the Hopewell Cul-
ture National Historical Park in Chil-
licothe to see millennia-old burial 
mounds from the original Native Amer-
icans who were there and earthworks 
from the area’s pre-Columbian inhab-
itants. Again, I also saw there about 
$3.5 million in unmet maintenance 
needs, including needed repairs to the 
exterior of the visitor center and its 
trail system. 
Parks have a lot of issues that over 
time have built up, and that is a huge 
problem for us. In a way, it is kind of 
like being a homeowner: If you allow 
the deferred maintenance to build up, 
if you don’t take care of the roof, what 
happens? Your drywall gets wet, and 
you have mold in the drywall, and then 
the floor starts to buckle. But for being 
able to fix that roof, you have all kinds 
of other problems. That is what has 
been happening in our parks. The costs 
just keep mounting. The total backlog 
at the national parks is now believed 
to be over $12 billion. 
By the way, we require the parks to 
keep these lists: What are your most 
urgent needs, and what are the broad 
needs you have in terms of deferred 
maintenance? So we have good data on 
this one, and we know it is over $12 bil-
lion. 
It is a compounding problem. If you 
don’t fix it, it gets worse and worse and 
worse, which only increases the cost to 
taxpayers. The longer we wait to ad-
dress these maintenance needs—not 
fixing the hole in the roof creates a lot 
of other costs for taxpayers. 
I like this legislation because essen-
tially it is saying: These are debts un-
paid. This is work that should have 
been done previously. So let’s find a 
funding source that is appropriate to 
that. I think the funding source we 
found is the right one, which is the on- 
and offshore oil and gas revenues. In-
stead of going into the U.S. Govern-
ment, some of these are going to be di-
verted to our national parks to pay for 
expenses that have been there for years 
that we should have paid for earlier but 
just don’t have the method and the 
ability to pay for those kinds of capital 
expenses or those kinds of deferred 
maintenance projects in the annual 
budget. 
So that is why we need to address 
this problem, and it is a problem that 
is growing. We don’t want it to get 
worse. Again, it comes at a time when 
visitation is pretty good. From 2006 to 
2017, annual visitation increased by 
more than 58 million people. Again, 
over 330 million people visited the 
parks last year. That has also put, I be-
lieve, more pressure on the parks and 
on this deferred maintenance we talked 
about. 
The challenges of keeping up with it 
have stretched our land management 
agencies thin—not just the parks but 
the Forest Service, our fish and wild-
life refuges, our other Department of 
Interior land. We have more issues now 
because so many of these lands have 
been using bandaids to kind of get 
through it, and that doesn’t deal with 
the underlying issues, so the costs are 
mounting. 
We initially introduced this common-
sense solution to just deal with the 
parks, which, again, have reached over 
$12 billion. Since then, I am pleased to 
say we have worked with our col-
leagues on the other side of the Cap-
itol, who included these other lands, 
and also with the administration to in-
clude funding for other land manage-
ment agencies that also have deferred 
maintenance issues—again, the Forest 
Service, the BLM over at the Depart-
ment of Interior, the fish and wildlife 
refuges, and some of the Bureau of In-
dian Affairs lands. 
To address this, the legislation before 
us creates what is called the Legacy 
Restoration Fund, which will provide 
$1.9 billion per year for 5 years—it is a 
5-year program—from unobligated on- 
and offshore energy revenue. So these 
are royalties from that energy, which 
is actually increasing as we do more 
exploration. So it is a total over 5 
years—$1.9 billion a year—of $9.5 bil-
lion to be divided across the National 
Park Service, which gets the bulk of it, 
but also the Forest Service, wildlife 
refuge, Bureau of Land Management, 
and Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
It addresses only the priority needs 
because that is not enough to take care 
of all the needs. But the way the parks 
have analyzed this, they have priority 
needs of about $6.5 billion, as an exam-
ple, out of the $12 billion, and all of 
those needs can be met with this fund-
ing. It is not all that is needed. We 
know we will have to go back at this 
again. But it is a very important bill— 
to do this for these 5 years to ensure 
that we can indeed have these treas-
ures continue to be places where visi-
tors can come from around the world, 
from around the country, from the 
Cleveland city schools right next to the 
Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and 
enjoy the majesty of our public lands. 
I want to thank my colleagues 
again—Senators 
GARDNER, 
MANCHIN, 
and DAINES—for their support in help-
ing to put this final package together. 
I want to thank our Restore Our Parks 
Act colleagues who have been at this a 
long time—4 or 5 years—Senator WAR-
NER, myself, and also Senator ALEX-
ANDER and Senator KING. 
Finally, I would like to once again 
thank President Trump for his strong 
support of the Restore Our Parks Act 
over the past few years and now of this 
new product that has come together. 
He understands the need to protect the 
natural beauty of our public lands. I 
spoke to him about it today. 
To me, the Great American Outdoors 
Act is the next step in carrying out 
Teddy Roosevelt’s legacy, Teddy Roo-
sevelt’s mission of protecting the envi-
ronment for future generations. 
I look forward to the ability to de-
bate this on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate week after next and to then pass it 
with a strong bipartisan vote and send 
it to the President for his signature to 
ensure that this landmark legislation, 
this historic legislation, can be enacted 
into law. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise this evening to discuss the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act of 
1969, which is oftentimes referred to as 
the ‘‘Magna Carta’’ of environmental 
laws. When I think about our Nation’s 
most illustrious documents, I am re-
minded of the true expression of Amer-
ica and its aspirations. I am reminded 
of our Declaration of Independence and 
its embrace of ‘‘Life, Liberty and the 
pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
I am also reminded of our Constitu-
tion. Delaware is known as the First 
State because we were the first State 
to ratify the Constitution, December 7, 
1787—one week before anybody else. 
Our Constitution is the most replicated 
and enduring Constitution in the his-
tory of the world. It is not entirely un-
like our more recent expressions of 
America’s values and guiding prin-
ciples, 
like 
the 
National 
Environ-
mental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. 
NEPA has served as one of our bedrock 
environmental laws for a half century 
now. 
According to its six pages of statute, 
NEPA’s 
purpose 
includes 
‘‘efforts 
which will prevent or eliminate dam-
age to the environment and biosphere 
and stimulate the health and welfare of 
man.’’ 
NEPA enshrines democracy by giving 
the American people a voice to help de-
cide the fate of Federal decisions. For 
50 years, NEPA has sought to ensure 
environmental 
protection, 
public 
health, and the notion that the Amer-
ican people have a say in Federal deci-
sion making. 
Like our Constitution, NEPA is one 
of our Nation’s most replicated laws. 
The same principles of democracy and 
citizen participation that are enshrined 
in our Constitution are also enshrined 
in NEPA. We have made changes to our 
Constitution over the years, but those 
changes were made rarely and with 
great forethought. 
However, just 60 days ago, the Trump 
administration proposed a rule that

March 10, 2020 
would fundamentally change the NEPA 
regulation for the first time in its 50- 
year history. 
Earlier this month, I testified at the 
Council on Environmental Quality’s 
public hearing in Washington, DC. 
There, I stated that unlike the Ten 
Commandments, the NEPA regulations 
are not written in stone. I understand 
that. 
In 1978, there was broad consensus to 
finalize the NEPA regulations. If we 
had that same kind of broad consensus 
today to update certain NEPA provi-
sions, this would be another story. 
After all, I have said oftentimes that if 
something isn’t perfect, let’s make it 
better. But there is a reason that 
NEPA is one of the most imitated envi-
ronmental laws on this planet—it has 
had a lot of success. 
Any changes to the implementing 
regulations of this bedrock law—let 
alone such substantial changes pro-
posed by the Council on Environment 
Quality to NEPA regulations—require 
careful thought, meticulous delibera-
tions, and bipartisanship. Consequen-
tial changes should be made rarely and 
with great forethought. 
Speaking of bipartisanship, one of 
our nominees before the Environment 
and Public Works last year, nominated 
for a senior position in the Department 
of Interior, said, in these words: Bipar-
tisan solutions are lasting solutions. 
That is what he said. He is a Repub-
lican, from Wyoming. He said: Bipar-
tisan solutions are lasting solutions. 
NEPA was signed into law 50 years 
ago by a Republican President, Richard 
Nixon. NEPA was passed in this body 
by a bipartisan majority. NEPA was 
passed in the House by a bipartisan 
majority. The reason why it is still 
alive and well and functioning, pro-
tecting our environment, is because it 
is a bipartisan solution, and it has 
helped make it a lasting solution. 
Any changes—any changes to the im-
plementing regulations of this bedrock 
law, let alone the kind of changes 
sought by CEQ, require a lot more 
careful thought, deliberation, and bi-
partisanship. 
CEQ simply has not aimed to address 
the needs of all the stakeholders. Wit-
ness the universal opposition of the en-
vironmental community, NEPA’s most 
consistent constituency. Council on 
Environmental Quality has touted this 
proposal—their proposal now—as a way 
to ‘‘modernize’’ NEPA. However, the 
proposal is instead an anachronism, 
taking us back to a time when con-
struction bulldozed and disconnected 
communities, before NEPA was en-
acted in 1970. 
This proposal casts aside any consid-
eration of frontline communities, as 
well as the severe environmental con-
sequences that come with eliminating 
the requirement to consider cumu-
lative environmental impacts and indi-
rect effects. 
Taking away that requirement is 
akin to creating a new NEPA mandate 
that would exclude the impact to air 
quality—or water quality—from a pro-
posed action. Simply put, it makes no 
sense. 
Not only is removing these require-
ments a bad idea for public health and 
for our environment, but doing so will 
end up costing taxpayers more when 
projects aren’t built to be resilient and, 
as a result, taxpayer investments are 
quite literally washed away by the 
next big storm or flood. 
What is more, this proposal gives the 
fox the keys to the henhouse by allow-
ing companies to write their own envi-
ronmental impact statements. Think 
about that—by allowing companies to 
write their own environmental impact 
statements. That is a little bit like of-
fering students self-graded, take-home 
exams. This proposal also creates loop-
holes to avoid environmental review 
and public input, which is especially 
harmful to environmental justice com-
munities that are often the targets of 
industrial investments and projects. 
I take no joy in saying this, but the 
proposal before us is one that is, sadly, 
myopic and ideologically driven. I have 
repeatedly called on CEQ to withdraw 
this proposal, and I do so again today. 
Along with the policy, I must also 
mention CEQ’s refusal to open this no-
tice to proposed rulemaking to greater 
public involvement that is commensu-
rate with its gravity and scope. 
In rebuttal to repeated concerns from 
more than 160 Members of Congress, 
and literally hundreds—hundreds—of 
stakeholder organizations, CEQ stated 
that it is ‘‘engaging in extensive public 
outreach, including through requests 
for public comments, two hearings and 
other outreach’’—two hearings in the 
whole country. 
Just last week, with only three full 
business days prior to the close of the 
comment period, CEQ finally told 166 
other Members of Congress and me 
that it would refuse to extend the pub-
lic comment period, thus providing the 
public as little opportunity as possible 
to have their voices heard. 
Both CEQ’s reply and its public 
statements make clear that CEQ be-
lieves it somehow deserves extra credit 
for allowing the public to participate 
in this rulemaking. Public involvement 
means not only an opportunity to com-
ment, it means taking those comments 
seriously by CEQ. 
Let me be clear. Neither this CEQ 
nor any Council on Environmental 
Quality gets extra credit for the mere 
act of requesting public comments on 
America’s bedrock environmental law. 
CEQ certainly does not deserve extra 
credit for allowing only 60 days to re-
view and comment on this massive en-
vironmental protection rollback. CEQ 
also does not get extra credit for only 
two hearings in the entire country— 
two hearings—to receive public com-
ment. 
At these hearings, the public needed 
a ticket and only got 3 minutes to 
speak. Think about that: 3 minutes for 
a law that has been around for a half 
century that is a basic bedrock envi-
ronmental law, 3 minutes; constraining 
comments to a couple of minutes; the 
idea of requiring tickets, as if it is 
some kind of prize to participate in 
something that should be a democratic 
norm; and the idea of CEQ failing to 
engage a single speaker in Denver or 
Washington, DC. Think about that: not 
engaging even one speaker in the two 
places where the public actually had 
the opportunity to comment. Not one. 
That doesn’t constitute an open proc-
ess, not where I come from. I think it 
probably doesn’t for most other folks 
as well. It doesn’t come close. What we 
have here is a clear sign that CEQ is 
limiting the involvement of the public 
and wants the clock to expire before 
the public can find out what is actually 
in the massive rewrite. That is what it 
is. 
To say I am disappointed with CEQ’s 
response is an understatement. NEPA 
is a 50-year-old law, but Americans 
have only been given 60 days to defend 
it. 
I will go back to what I said before. 
No law is written in stone. The Dec-
laration of Independence, the Constitu-
tion of our country are not written in 
stone. Everything we do, I know we can 
do better. But the way CEQ has ap-
proached this task, this undertaking, is 
not just disappointing, I think it is 
shameful. 
NEPA reminds us that our govern-
ment is one that is of the people, for 
the people, and by the people. But this 
proposal and this process bear—what I 
just described—little resemblance to 
those 
words 
of 
Abraham 
Lincoln. 
Sadly, they make a mockery of them. 
Let me be clear. I will continue to 
fight to defend NEPA and the demo-
cratic tools it avails to the American 
people. 
I yield the floor to my friend from 
Oklahoma.

ator from Oklahoma. 
EMBRACE HOPE 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to unasham-
edly brag on the people of Southwest 
Oklahoma. It is a pretty remarkable 
group of folks. In the community 
around Lawton, OK, and surrounding 
communities, there are people who 
serve their neighbors every day. There 
is a remarkable group of churches and 
nonprofits, ministries, Federal work-
ers, State, city, and county staff who 
are there and do a pretty amazing job 
of taking care of their neighbors. 
This weekend is above and beyond. 
This weekend, Southwest Oklahomans 
organized what they call Southwest 
Oklahoma Embrace Hope—so 1 day, on 
Saturday, where the whole community 
will be having neighbors serving neigh-
bors to see what they can do to help 
each other. 
Serving your neighbor is not about 
how much money you have or a title 
you hold or a certain house you live in. 
Taking care of your neighbor is just 
basic honoring each other and finding a 
way to love your neighbor. The vision

March 10, 2020 
behind the Embrace Hope event is 
about stepping up and saying as indi-
viduals that we can do more if we do it 
together. 
The Embrace Hope community event 
in Lawton will offer Oklahomans an 
opportunity to access a lot of free serv-
ices and some basic help. There are 
partners from all over the State of 
Oklahoma who have donated their 
time, their services, their finances to 
help those in need all over Southwest 
Oklahoma—all in one place, all at one 
time. If someone needs housing—shel-
ter, information, or a referral, food— 
there will be folks there who can help 
them. 
There will be agencies there to talk 
about long-term needs and people need-
ing short-term needs. If someone needs 
a job, there will be folks there who will 
show them opportunities for hiring. If 
someone needs to get their resume to-
gether so they can get a job, there will 
be folks there who can take a picture 
so they can use it with their resume. In 
fact, if folks need a suit to wear to an 
interview, there will be folks there to 
help them get a suit so they are able to 
prepare themselves for a job. 
There will be health services there. 
You can schedule an appointment with 
a local health center, and there will 
also be ways to get dental services, op-
tometry, pregnancy resources, or even 
a breast exam, if that is needed. 
There will be folks there who can 
give them a haircut if they need a hair-
cut and haven’t been able to get access 
to that. 
There will be folks there who are 
mental health professionals and coun-
selors so they can interact with folks 
who may struggle with substance abuse 
or dealing with the stress of life. There 
will be folks there who can help them 
with legal assistance. These are com-
munities coming together; ministries, 
churches, organizations, and govern-
ment agencies are all coming to one 
place at one time to help. 
There are a lot of needs in the area. 
In fact, in Oklahoma, according to DHS 
statistics just from this last year, we 
had 78,000-plus households that needed 
winter heating assistance in our State. 
More than 378,000 Oklahomans receive 
food benefits, like the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program. These 
are Federal resources and Federal pro-
grams. 
As Members of Congress, we work to-
gether to help in whatever way we can 
to help those in greatest need to be 
lifted out of poverty and to be able to 
walk through some of their low points 
in life. But a government check or a 
check-in with a Federal entity is no 
substitute for a neighbor helping a 
neighbor. When you are at your low 
point of life, a check is helpful to get 
you through a hard time, but you need 
a person; you need a mentor; you need 
a friend; you need a neighbor. 
The Embrace Hope event is all about 
that. It is neighbors helping each other 
to be able to walk through this process, 
but it is also about opportunities for 
people who live in Southwest Okla-
homa. It is not just to help someone 
one day, but also to understand that we 
could do this throughout the course of 
the year because there are lots of folks 
who say: I want to be able to help. 
They just don’t know where to go to 
be able to help their neighbors. They 
might help the folks who are around 
them; they might help people in a 
small group at their church; they 
might have family members they help, 
but they say that they want to be able 
to do more. 
The Embrace Hope event allows vol-
unteers by the hundreds who have 
signed up to serve their neighbor one 
day, but it also allows them to take a 
test drive with a bunch of other min-
istries and nonprofits in the area and 
say: What do you do that I can volun-
teer one day to help people, but maybe 
I can plug in and help you at other 
times? 
It allows those nonprofits and min-
istries to reach out to a whole pool of 
people, who maybe are not involved all 
the time, to say: If you enjoyed helping 
your neighbor that day, why don’t you 
come work with us the rest of the 
year? 
It is a way for them to meet each 
other. Quite frankly, it is a way for us 
to build a stronger State, a stronger 
community, and stronger connections 
with our neighbors so that we don’t de-
fault by saying ‘‘They get help from 
the government, so that is probably all 
they need,’’ when we know in our heart 
it is not. They need help from some-
body local. They need a friend, and 
they need somebody who can look 
them in the face and say: How can we 
help? That is Embrace Hope. 
There have been hundreds of people 
who have volunteered already, and as 
they are preparing for this Saturday, it 
will probably be a cold and wet day, 
which is a perfect day to help people in 
need. 
As we get together on this Saturday 
with all the volunteers and all the 
folks, there will be one person who will 
be in the background whom the whole 
event will circle around, but a lot of 
folks will not know it. Her name is 
Brenda Spencer-Ragland. She is the 
lead event coordinator for Embrace 
Hope. I can’t even imagine how many 
hundreds of hours she has put in behind 
the scenes to be able to bring this to 
reality. Her title is event coordinator, 
but that title doesn’t remotely do jus-
tice for the work she has done to bring 
Embrace Hope to reality. 
She is one of those incredible individ-
uals who everyone wishes lived around 
them, but Southwest Oklahoma actu-
ally has her. She has a servant’s heart 
and a servant’s attitude. It is who she 
is, quite frankly, more than just what 
she does. 
Brenda served our Nation as a civil-
ian with the U.S. Army for 32 years be-
fore assuming her current role. She 
was Director of the Family and Morale, 
Welfare and Recreation Program at 
Fort Sill in Lawton. Her title was a 
fancy way of saying that she took care 
of military families in whatever way 
she possibly could, and she did it well. 
She loved serving those who serve us. 
On her retirement, she grieved because 
she loved serving those folks at the 
post. 
Now, after dealing with morale at 
Fort Sill and after serving also as the 
Housing Director at Fort Sill, she has 
found a new way to serve—Embrace 
Hope. She has built around that same 
mission. She came to Oklahoma City, 
and she saw an event called Love OKC, 
which was similar to this. She brought 
a whole group of volunteers to come 
take a look at what was happening in 
Oklahoma City and the remarkable 
Love OKC event that has happened for 
7 years in a row. She took that vision 
back to Southwest Oklahoma and cre-
ated Embrace Hope. Meeting after 
meeting, donor after donor, long night 
after long night of organizing—it is 
about to happen. 
Brenda, for all of the folks in Lawton 
who don’t know you, they should be-
cause, if they did, they would give you 
a warm hug and a very grateful thank- 
you for blessing so many people. Thank 
you for answering the call to serve 
your friends and neighbors and step-
ping up when you saw a need and tire-
lessly giving back to Southwest Okla-
homa and the community that you 
love. It is an honor to call you a friend 
and a neighbor. I look forward to serv-
ing alongside you this weekend in Em-
brace Hope, doing whatever you need 
me to do to help you as we love our 
neighbors together. 
God bless you. I look forward to see-
ing you there, Brenda. I love getting a 
chance to be able to brag about what is 
happening in the great Southwest 
Oklahoma. 
I yield the floor.

S1666 
March 10, 2020 
to commemorate their 50 years of serv-
ice. 
St. Michael’s Fire and Rescue Squad 
was founded in late 1969, after a local 
student died while waiting for emer-
gency medical services to arrive. The 
community recognized that in order to 
prevent further tragedies of this na-
ture, greater resources must be dedi-
cated to emergency responders. Stu-
dents rose to this challenge, and with 
the help of Donald ‘‘Pappy’’ Sutton, 
the former dean of students, they 
formed the squad. Despite starting out 
with only minimal equipment, this re-
markable group now serves 385 square 
miles of Chittenden County, spanning 
their reach into surrounding towns and 
along 26 miles of Interstate 89. The ter-
ritory covered far exceeds what we 
might expect from a group of college 
volunteers, but their capacity to serve 
only goes to show just how dedicated 
the St. Michael’s Fire and Rescue team 
truly is. 
Perhaps one of the most impressive 
aspects of this team is the fact that 
they are all between the ages of 18 and 
22. The maturity and grace displayed 
by these young individuals while ful-
filling their duties is nothing short of 
inspiring. These are people who, for 
some, have just left home for the first 
time and yet are successfully respond-
ing to crisis situations which would tax 
even the most experienced of us. These 
responders will sometimes be the first 
on the scene for a car crash, overdose, 
fire or medical emergency, and a split- 
second decision could make the dif-
ference between a life saved and a life 
lost. And we should not forget: these 
responders are all students managing 
their college classes in addition to vol-
unteering. Emergencies give no cre-
dence to a student’s sleep schedule; 
sometimes these students will get 
woken up in the late hours of the night 
or early hours of the morning to put 
out a fire, despite having class the fol-
lowing morning. Those who receive 
credit for their volunteer work are on 
call for 24 hours a week, taking turns 
sleeping in the designated volunteer 
bunks. 
The work done by the St. Michael’s 
Fire and Rescue team is not always 
glamorous, but it has kept the commu-
nity remarkably safer. On average, the 
squad responds to more than 3,000 calls 
each year—some just false alarms, oth-
ers far more severe in nature. But what 
has remained consistent is the relief 
that these volunteers have offered to 
local emergency responders and the 
peace of mind they have bestowed upon 
our residents. By offering support to 
our hard-working first responders, they 
inevitably 
ensure 
that 
more 
Vermonters get the help they need in 
the nick of time. In the process, they 
have inspired other college campuses 
around the Nation to form their own 
volunteer response teams, who can 
then help their own communities in 
times of need. 
This is the type of bravery and self-
lessness that we are proud to see exem-
plified in our young citizens, and I am 
honored 
to 
have 
them 
recognized 
today.

RECOGNIZING ELMORE MOUNTAIN 
BREAD 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
want to take a moment to recognize a 
Vermont gem, Elmore Mountain Bread, 
a small business founded by a wife and 
husband team. Blair Marvin is a native 
Vermonter, who met her husband, An-
drew Heyn, in Seattle, where she at-
tended culinary school and worked. 
Blair brought Andrew to Vermont, 
where after working in several local 
restaurants, they took over a small 
bakery. Their work has been recog-
nized locally, regionally, and nation-
ally, in publications including Kids VT, 
Yankee Magazine and over the air-
waves on National Public Radio. An ar-
ticle by Amelia Nierenberg in the Feb-
ruary 18, 2020, edition of the New York 
Times focuses on Blair and Andrew’s 
development of soft, sliced organic 
loaves, inspired by Blair’s effort to pro-
vide healthier bread to their son 
Phineas’s classmates at a local one- 
room schoolhouse. Small businesses 
like Elmore Mountain Bread are the 
cornerstone of our local economies, are 
fixtures in our communities, and are at 
the very heart of the American dream. 
In recognition of Blair and Andrew’s ef-
forts, I ask that the article ‘‘The 
Whole-Grain Grail: A Sandwich Bread 
With Mass Appeal,’’ be printed in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Feb. 18, 2020] 
THE WHOLE-GRAIN GRAIL: A SANDWICH BREAD 
WITH MASS APPEAL 
(By Amelia Nierenberg) 
ELMORE, VT.—When Blair Marvin started 
making and selling bread 15 years ago, she 
promised herself three things: She would 
never preslice it. She would never bake it in 
a pan. And she would certainly never sell it 
in plastic. 
But three years ago, as she was helping out 
in the one-room schoolhouse where her son, 
Phineas, attended first grade, she realized 
she had a problem. At lunch, his friends 
weren’t eating sandwiches made from the 
stone-ground, organic loaves she and her 
husband baked at Elmore Mountain Bread, 
and sold in local supermarkets. Sure, the 
students had Vermont-churned cheese from 
Vermont-raised cows. But their bread often 
came from a national bread company, made 
from white flour or laced with preservatives. 
‘‘All of these preconceived notions and 
standards I set for myself,’’ said Ms. Marvin, 
39. ‘‘None of it mattered. If Phineas’s peers 
weren’t eating our bread, then we were doing 
something wrong.’’ 
So she broke her vow. Using mostly whole- 
wheat flour, stone-ground in a mill made by 
New American Stone Mills, a company 
owned by her husband, Andrew Heyn, she de-
veloped a new loaf—soft, sliced and sealed in 
plastic. 
‘‘Everybody should have access to healthy 
food,’’ she said. ‘‘We’re trying to make some-
thing that is recognizable to the general pop-
ulation. It’s a way of getting real bread into 
people’s diets.’’ Ms. Marvin and Mr. Heyn are 
part of a collective of about 40 bakers, mil-
lers, teachers and wheat-breeders who work 
with the Bread Lab, a famed research center 
affiliated with Washington State University 
that has long focused on developing wheat 
varieties specific to regions of the country. 
Since last April, using guidelines established 
by the lab, the collective has pursued a com-
mon goal: making a whole-grain loaf that’s 
familiar-looking and affordable enough to 
appeal to a mass audience. 
The Bread Lab calls it ‘‘the approachable 
loaf,’’ but each bakery in the Bread Lab Col-
lective makes a slightly different version, in-
formed by local tastes and local grains. 
Elmore Mountain Bread calls its bread the 
Vermont Redeemer, after a type of local 
wheat. 
Zingerman’s 
Bakehouse, 
in 
Ann 
Arbor, Mich., calls its loaf State St. Wheat. 
King Arthur Flour, an employee-owned com-
pany in Norwich, Vt., christened its version 
Just Bread and published a recipe for home 
bakers on its website. It sells 350 of the 
loaves a week and donates others to a food 
pantry, said Karen Colberg, a chief executive 
at King Arthur Flour. 
Whatever the name, the approachable loaf 
is made in 20 states, from Kalispell, Mont., 
to New Haven, Conn., as well as in England, 
Canada and Australia. For each loaf sold, 10 
cents goes back to the Bread Lab to help 
fund grain research. 
The loaf is something of a Trojan horse, a 
way to sneak healthy ingredients onto the 
taste buds of a younger generation. Its dis-
guise as a standard-issue sandwich bread 
might be just the guerrilla tactic needed to 
get regional whole grains integrated into the 
developed world’s diet. 
‘‘If it’s crusty, you’re not going to get soc-
cer moms saying, ‘Hey, we need to make pea-
nut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 
this,’ ’’ said Anthony Ambeliotis, a member 
of the collective who sells a version of the 
approachable loaf for $4.50 at Mediterra 
Bakehouse, his family bakery outside Pitts-
burgh. 
Despite a growing interest in baking bread 
and declining consumption of white bread, 
most loaves sold in America are still less 
than ideal in nutrients and fiber. Even the 
whole-grain breads that have reached a na-
tional market sometimes contain chemical 
preservatives 
or 
additives, 
like 
flavor 
enhancers or sugars. 
‘‘Why is it that ‘affordable’ has to be this 
hyper-centralized, hyper-processed product?’’ 
said Stephen Jones, the director of the Bread 
Lab, standing in its flour-covered research 
kitchen in Burlington, Wash., about 70 miles 
north of Seattle. 
Since he founded the lab in 2011, Dr. Jones 
has tried to reinvent bread by promoting re-
gional grain, breeding wheat varieties that 
taste good, like heirloom strains, but have a 
strong yield, like most modern hybrids. At 
the Grain Gathering conference, an annual 
meeting he hosts at the lab, enthusiasts and 
members of the collective come together to 
discuss how to incorporate the lab’s research 
into craft baking. 
‘‘Once, if you said, ‘I want to put my bread 
in a plastic bag and I want it sliced,’ people 
would be like: ‘I think you’re at the wrong 
conference,’ ’’ said Louie Prager, an owner of 
Prager Brothers Artisan Breads in San 
Diego, which sold 4,800 approachable loaves 
last year, at $5 apiece. ‘‘But now, it’s fine to 
make a bread that works better for more 
people.’’ 
In summer 2018, Dr. Jones laid out his new 
vision. Like Ms. Marvin, he recognized that 
the collective needed to pivot and work with, 
rather than against, an American palate 
shaped by generations of white-bread sand-
wiches. To build the base formula for the 
new bread, he turned to Jeff Yankellow, a 
baker and the western region sales manager 
for King Arthur Flour.

‘‘It’s not the bricks of whole wheat bread 
that you think of from the hippie days,’’ Mr. 
Yankellow said. ‘‘We’re making really good 
stuff.’’ 
The Bread Lab has set three strict param-
eters for the approachable loaf: More than 60 
percent of the flour must be whole wheat; it 
can’t have more than seven ingredients, all 
of which have to be real food, not chemical 
additives; and it can’t cost more than $6. 
‘‘It’s local, and I know the people who 
make it,’’ said Elaina Lefevre, 27, who regu-
larly buys Ms. Marvin’s loaf for her young 
daughter at the Hannaford supermarket in 
Morrisville, Vt. ‘‘Five ingredients or less on 
a label is what I aim for.’’ 
Bread is among the simplest and most 
mundane things humans eat. It’s in our pray-
ers: Give us this day our daily bread. It’s in 
our wallets: our bread and butter. 
But bread has also been a catalyst for 
change. In 1789, the high price of bread 
brought angry protesters to the streets of 
Paris. In 2011, it did again, in Cairo’s Tahrir 
Square. 
‘‘There’s nothing more revolutionary than 
bread,’’ Dr. Jones said. ‘‘But there’s also 
nothing more mundane or pedestrian than 
bread. It’s who we are.’’ 
Dr. Jones often works in an apron branded 
with a skull and the words ‘‘White Sliced 
Death,’’ armor in his crusade for whole 
grains. Still, his no-hostages approach to 
white flour and regional grains has earned 
him the respect of many in the local-food 
movement. 
‘‘I think what we’re doing is radical,’’ Mr. 
Prager said. ‘‘It’s radical to make good, or-
ganic, clean food affordable to more people.’’ 
The collective has a point. It is a curious 
quirk of contemporary America that a 6- 
year-old from Burlington, Vt., and a 6-year- 
old from Burlington, Wash., can eat entirely 
identical sandwiches for lunch. Once, that 
would have been impossible. Vermont bread 
was made with Vermont wheat, and Wash-
ington bread was made with Washington 
wheat, made from local grains ground in 
local mills. 
But in the late 19th century, a new tech-
nology arrived from Europe, changing Amer-
ican flour: roller mills, which separate the 
bran—the ‘‘whole’’ part of whole wheat— 
from the kernel. Without the bran’s oils and 
proteins, the chalky ‘‘all-purpose flour’’ that 
most Americans would recognize today is 
inert and easier to preserve. 
Although it keeps longer, white flour is 
less nutritious, as the bran holds most of the 
kernel’s fiber. Dr. Jones also thinks it is 
wasteful in an agricultural system strug-
gling to adapt to climate change. 
‘‘If you’re a farmer and you grow 100 
pounds of wheat, only 70 of it is going to be 
made into food,’’ Dr. Jones said ‘‘If you 
wanted to raise the yield of wheat tomorrow, 
just eat the whole kernel.’’ 
Without added chemicals to keep the bread 
soft and mold-free, the approachable loaf has 
a shelf life of about a week before it goes 
stale. This requirement also helps ensure 
that the bread stays local; any time spent 
traveling to a store would waste precious 
freshness. 
‘‘There’s no reason that bread should keep 
for this long,’’ said Dr. Jones, shaking a 
mass-produced loaf with a sell-by date of 
June 2018 that is still soft. He keeps it in the 
lab to help make his case. 
Today, after millenniums as a daily staple, 
good bread has almost become a luxury item. 
Whole-wheat flour can be expensive, espe-
cially if it’s organic. Loaves baked by hand 
cost more, as bakers need to be paid for their 
time and labor. 
Even $6 for the approachable loaf can be a 
steep price for many families. But though 
it’s not as cheap as Wonder Bread, the loaf is 
close in price to most other whole-wheat op-
tions sold in supermarkets. Members of the 
collective hope that, together, they get 
Americans to take bread more seriously. 
‘‘People care about their hops and their 
cheese and their coffee and their dairy and 
their meat, but they don’t even think twice 
about their grains,’’ Ms. Marvin said. ‘‘But 
bread is the most broken.’’

RECOGNIZING KING ARTHUR 
FLOUR 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Madam 
President, 
Vermont’s King Arthur Flour has long 
been a worldwide leader in culinary 
circles. Today, I would like to recog-
nize the company’s effort to produce a 
healthier bread, called Just Bread. 
King Arthur Flour, which is an em-
ployee-owned company in Norwich, VT, 
sells 350 loaves of Just Bread each week 
and also donates loaves to a local food 
shelf, 
in 
the 
true 
tradition 
of 
Vermonters reaching out to help oth-
ers. In recognition of these efforts, I 
ask that the February 18, 2020, article

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOSEPH 
VICTOR SHELDON III 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, 
today, I would like to recognize Capt. 
Joseph Victor Sheldon III, command 
chaplain, 4th Marine Division, for his 
32 years of service in the U.S. Navy as 
he approaches his retirement cere-
mony. Captain Sheldon will be dearly 
missed by those who served with him, 
and our country thanks him for his 
dedicated service. 
Captain Sheldon served in a unique 
and critically important role as a chap-
lain in the U.S. Navy. His recognition 
of the importance of this role allowed 
him to effectively serve the soldiers he 
served with, as well as their families 
and civilian military workers. Military 
chaplains are also charged with forging 
relationships with their counterparts 
around the world when they serve 
abroad. Captain Sheldon took this re-
sponsibility in stride and provided a 
blueprint on how military chaplains 
should build relationships with their 
religious counterparts. 
His service included time in the Mid-
dle East following 9/11, Germany, the 
Pentagon, as well as serving as the Di-
rector of Religious Affairs of the Com-
bined Joint Task Force in the Horn of 
Africa, CJTF–HOA. Louisiana and the 
entire Nation are grateful for Captain 
Sheldon’s life of service to our great 
country.∑

RECOGNIZING MINOT, NORTH 
DAKOTA 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the city of 
Minot. It has been 60 years since the 
U.S. Air Force and Minot began work-
ing together to establish the Minot Air 
Force Base in northwestern North Da-
kota. This was in the late 1950s, when 
Minot leaders stepped up to buy the 
land where the air base now stands. 
Throughout the ensuing decades of 
growth and change in the Minot com-
munity and the base itself, this co-
operation has continued. 
This year, the Air Force Global 
Strike Command has recognized this 
solid 
partnership 
by 
awarding 
its 
Barksdale Trophy to the city of Minot. 
This honor is given to the community 
providing the most outstanding sup-
port to one of its bases. Minot Air 
Force Base’s 5th Bomb Wing and 91st 
Missile Wing support the Air Force 
Global Strike Command. The trophy is 
awarded by Shreveport and Bossier, 
LA, which are home to the command 
and the Barksdale Air Force Base. 
The Minot Area Chamber of Com-
merce submitted the city’s nomination 
for this award and in it detailed many 
notable projects and partnerships over 
the years. This includes a community 
auction, which for 30 years has raised 
$800,000-plus for programs supporting 
the morale of those at the base. An-
other 30-year event is a Military Ball, 
bringing airmen and their spouses and 
area residents together for a special 
evening. A favorite holiday tradition is 
the thousands of home-baked cookies 
delivered to airmen who are spending 
their first year in Minot and are unable 
to be home for Christmas. Those sta-
tioned at the base and their families 
reciprocate by volunteering to help 
with Minot’s many programs and an-
nual events, including the North Da-
kota 
State 
Fair 
and 
the 
Norsk 
Hostfest. 
In North Dakota, we take pride in 
the two Air Force bases within our bor-
ders that help to safeguard world 
peace. The support we give to those 
who call North Dakota home while sta-
tioned at these bases is not done for 
recognition nor awards. Yet, receiving 
the Barksdale Trophy is a well-de-
served nod to North Dakota’s leg-
endary hospitality and its steadfast 
support of the Minot Air Force Base. 
Mr. President, I congratulate the 
residents of the Minot area for being 
awarded 
this 
prestigious 
Barksdale 
Trophy. On behalf of all North Dako-
tans, I thank them for their support of 
our Nation’s military and for wel-
coming those who are called to serve in 
this noble mission.∑

TRIBUTE TO TERRY HILL 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I am 
speaking today to highlight a service- 
disabled veteran and my constituent, 
Terry Hill, who is the CEO and co-
founder of Rapid Application Group, an 
additive manufacturing facility just 
outside of my hometown of Tulsa in 
Broken Arrow, OK. Mr. Hill is a hero 
who served his Nation nobly as a UH–60 
Black Hawk medical evacuation pilot, 
flying more than 750 combat missions 
serving in the U.S. Army. 
Due to Mr. Hill’s experience, he 
knows better than anyone just how es-
sential the technology of additive man-
ufacturing can be in the field to sup-
port nonflight-critical parts to in-
crease the overall readiness and force 
of our military. Additive manufac-
turing has improved military readiness 
and enabled the military services to be 
more self sustainable. Continued ad-
vancement in this area will further im-
prove our military’s readiness and 
overall ability to accomplish the mis-
sion at hand. 
When Mr. Hill returned home and 
started his business, he continued to 
serve our Nation by taking care of his 
fellow veterans. He is committed to 
hiring veterans to work in his facility 
and is known within our community 
for seeking out opportunities to help 
those who have worn the uniform. I 
take this opportunity today to high-
light and thank Mr. Hill for his service 
in the U.S. Army, but also for his con-
tinued service in delivering needed 
tools to the warfighter and for sup-
porting our veterans.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1669 
March 10, 2020 
REMEMBERING DR. THOMAS L. 
MORIN 
∑ Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, on 
February 25, Indiana lost a great Hoo-
sier when Dr. Thomas L. Morin passed 
away at the age of 76. Today, I rise to 
pay tribute to Tom’s remarkable leg-
acy as a husband, father, and professor 
and to recognize his educational serv-
ice to our State. 
In 1965, Tom earned his bachelor’s de-
gree at Rutgers University, followed by 
a master’s degree from the University 
of New Mexico in 1967. While on a full 
NASA scholarship, Tom subsequently 
earned a second master’s degree and a 
PhD in Operations Research from Case 
Western Reserve. 
For nearly 45 years, Tom served as a 
professor of industrial engineering at 
Purdue University in West Lafayette, 
IN. While at Purdue, he won the admi-
ration and respect of his students and 
colleagues alike. As a professor and re-
searcher, Tom changed the way young 
Hoosiers think, pushing students to 
pursue an analytical and practical ap-
proach to solving the world’s wide- 
ranging issues. A lifelong educator and 
Fulbright scholar, Tom was a gifted 
mentor to his students and a valued 
member of the scholarly community. 
Tom is one of those remarkable people 
that made Purdue University what it is 
today: the national destination for pio-
neering research and education in engi-
neering, research to which Tom was a 
key contributor. 
To his family, Tom was a man of re-
markable character and passion. He 
was utterly devoted to his children, 
grandchildren, and the love of his life, 
Susan, whom he met in 1962 and with 
whom he remained inseparable for 58 
years. As avid travelers, Tom and 
Susan toured the world together, from 
Las Vegas, to the Sahara and the 
Greek Isles. Beyond his own family, 
Tom served as a role model and a lead-
er in his community. On behalf of the 
Hoosier State, I recognize how fortu-
nate we are that Tom dedicated his 
life, passion, and knowledge to Indiana. 
While West Lafayette has lost a pil-
lar of its community with Tom’s pass-
ing, I believe that his work will serve 
as a legacy for future generations. I 
ask my colleagues to join me in ex-
tending our sympathies to Tom’s wife, 
Susan; 
two 
children, 
Michael 
and 
Marisa; and four grandchildren, An-
drew, Gaby, Charlie, and Kennedy, as 
they remember the great life of Dr. 
Thomas L. Morin.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–188. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey respectfully 
urging the United States Congress to propose 
an amendment to the United States Con-
stitution to prohibit the use of slavery or in-
dentured servitude for individuals convicted 
of a crime; to the Committee on the Judici-
ary. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 16 
Whereas, The Thirteenth Amendment to 
the United States Constitution was adopted 
in 1865, and is commonly understood to have 
abolished slavery and indentured servitude 
in the United States; and 
Whereas, 
The 
Thirteenth 
Amendment 
reads: ‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary ser-
vitude, except as a punishment for crime 
whereof the party shall have been duly con-
victed, shall exist within the United States, 
or any place subject to their jurisdiction’’; 
and 
Whereas, The Thirteenth Amendment did 
not completely abolish slavery and inden-
tured servitude, but rather allowed both 
slavery and indentured servitude to remain 
legal as punishments for individuals con-
victed of a crime; and 
Whereas, 
Twenty-Five 
percent 
of 
the 
worlds incarcerated population, roughly 2.3 
million people, currently reside in the 
United States; and 
Whereas, Nearly 20 percent of federal pris-
oners and seven percent of state prisoners 
are held in private correctional facilities; 
and 
Whereas, The private correctional facility 
industry is a $4.8 billion industry; and 
Whereas, In order to make a profit, private 
correctional facilities often rely on low cost 
labor provided by prison workers; and 
Whereas, According to the Seventh Circuit 
Appeals Court, prison workers are not enti-
tled to receive the minimum wage under the 
‘‘Fair Labor Standards Act,’’ and the aver-
age working inmate’s wage is 93 cents per 
hour; and 
Whereas, Incarcerated workers in states 
such as South Carolina and Texas are not 
paid for the work that they are forced to per-
form; and 
Whereas, According to the Solidarity Re-
search Center, the California prison system 
made a $58 million profit from the work of 
prison inmates, where 4,000 California prison 
workers earn $2 per day; and 
Whereas, Most of the work performed by 
incarcerated individuals does not develop 
skills that are translatable to the labor mar-
ket outside of prison; and 
Whereas, Therefore, it is appropriate for 
Congress to adopt an amendment to the 
United States Constitution to prohibit the 
use of slavery and indentured servitude for 
incarcerated individuals: Now, therefore,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1672 
March 10, 2020 
Be it resolved by the Senate of the State of 
New Jersey: 
1. This House urges Congress to propose an 
Amendment to the United States Constitu-
tion to prohibit the use of slavery, inden-
tured servitude, and involuntary servitude 
within the United States or any of its terri-
tories. 
2. Copies of this resolution as filed with the 
Secretary of State shall be transmitted by 
the Secretary of the Senate to the President 
of the United States Senate, the Speaker of 
the United States House of Representatives, 
and each member of Congress elected from 
this State. 
POM–189. A resolution adopted by the Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of New Jersey 
urging the United States Congress and the 
President of the United States to provide 
funding and other incentives to states to 
promote hydrogen fuel cell vehicle usage; to 
the Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
ASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 38 
Whereas, There is a vital need to support 
transportation energy sources other than 
imported and domestic fossil fuels, which ad-
versely affect economic growth, cause air 
pollution, and contribute to climate change; 
and 
Whereas, The promotion of hydrogen fuel 
cell vehicles and the infrastructure needed 
to refuel them would reduce the billions of 
dollars that New Jersey citizens, businesses, 
and institutions pay each year to foreign oil 
suppliers for the gasoline and diesel fuels 
needed to support an estimated 77 billion on- 
road vehicle miles traveled annually in the 
State; and 
Whereas, Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and 
related refueling infrastructure can be used 
to attract new business and industries to the 
State; and 
Whereas, New Jersey residents continue to 
breathe unhealthy levels of air toxins, such 
as oxides of nitrogen and ozone, which can 
compromise their health; and 
Whereas, Air pollution is particularly 
harmful for children with asthma and sen-
iors with breathing problems or other health 
issues, resulting in missed school days, asth-
ma attacks, and even premature deaths; and 
Whereas, Air quality will continue to dete-
riorate if practical approaches to transpor-
tation energy sources and transportation in-
frastructure in the State are not adopted; 
and 
Whereas, Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are 
zero emission—they run on compressed hy-
drogen fuel cells that produce electricity to 
propel the vehicle—so operating them does 
not produce air pollution; and 
Whereas, Global warming is a serious 
threat to New Jersey, putting the State’s 
beaches, waterfront communities, and tour-
ism industry at risk from sea-level rise, and 
threatening to cause dramatic and costly 
interruptions in vital transportation and 
shipping infrastructure; and 
Whereas, The State of New Jersey set 
strong standards to reduce global warming 
and air pollution and to increase renewable 
energy production through the passage of 
the ‘‘Global Warming Response Act’’ and the 
adoption of a strong renewable energy man-
date on the State’s utilities; and 
Whereas, Hydrogen can be produced using 
only electricity and water, so hydrogen fuel 
cell vehicles can be fueled and operated with-
out generating carbon dioxide or other 
greenhouse gases; now, therefore, and be it 
Resolved by the General Assembly of the State 
of New Jersey: 
1. This House respectfully urges the United 
States Congress and the President of the 
United States to provide financial support 
and other incentives to the states to pro-
mote and incentivize the local adoption of 
hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as a means of re-
ducing the nation’s dependence on fossil 
fuels, particularly imported fossil fuels, 
which would also serve to mitigate the detri-
mental effects of global warming and air pol-
lution caused by vehicle emissions. 
2. Copies of this resolution, as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Clerk of the General Assembly to the 
President and Vice President of the United 
States; the Majority and Minority Leaders of 
the United States Senate; The Speaker and 
Minority Leader of the United States House 
of Representatives; and every member of 
Congress elected from this State.

thority of the City of High Point, North

Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. MARKEY, 
Mr. CARDIN, Mr. BOOKER, and Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works: 
S. RES. 537 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act is one of the Nation’s bedrock envi-
ronmental laws that has helped protect the 
Nation’s environment and public health for 
half a century; 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act was passed by an overwhelming bi-
partisan majority in Congress and has long 
enjoyed widespread public support; 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act has a basic but critical purpose of di-
recting Federal agencies to identify and dis-
close the significant environmental and pub-
lic health impacts of major Federal actions 
before such actions are taken, encouraging a 
‘‘look before you leap’’ approach in Federal 
decision making; 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act appropriately gives the public a 
chance to review and give input on major 
projects before building and development 
starts, resulting in improved, more demo-
cratic government decision making on ev-
erything from fossil fuel, transportation, and 
water infrastructure decisions to habitat and 
ecosystem conservation; 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act is one of the most important tools 
available in the fight against the climate 
crisis; 
Whereas efforts to block the enforcement 
of the National Environmental Policy Act 
will make it easier for corporate polluters to 
hide the air, water, and climate impacts of 
major projects; 
Whereas efforts to block the enforcement 
of the National Environmental Policy Act 
will undermine critical building require-
ments that make our roads, bridges, and 
other infrastructure safer and better pre-
pared to withstand natural disasters such as 
wildfires, floods, and storms, which are get-
ting more destructive and severe as a result 
of climate change; 
Whereas efforts to block the enforcement 
of the National Environmental Policy Act 
will require the United States to spend bil-
lions more taxpayer dollars on infrastruc-
ture projects that won’t survive the effects 
of climate change; 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act is a critical civil rights tool that 
gives all Americans a voice in Federal deci-
sion making by allowing communities to be 
informed and weigh in on major proposed 
projects affecting their communities; 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act requires Federal agencies to evaluate 
the degree to which proposed projects affect 
air quality, water quality, public health, and 
public safety in nearby communities and 
consider alternative approaches that would 
be better for nearby communities and the en-
vironment; 
Whereas before the enactment of the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act there was 
often no way for people living in disadvan-
taged communities to become aware of, 
much less have their voices heard on, major 
projects that would result in dispropor-
tionate health and environmental impacts in 
their neighborhoods; 
Whereas that when the National Environ-
mental Policy Act’s public input process is 
cut short or weakened, ill-conceived projects 
advance that can have devastating public 
health and environmental consequences for 
American communities; and 
Whereas the National Environmental Pol-
icy Act’s charge to ‘‘foster and maintain 
conditions under which man and nature can 
exist in productive harmony’’ is timeless and 
its insistence on meaningful local involve-
ment, sustainable development, and delib-
erate Federal decision making was, and re-
mains, visionary: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the value of the National En-
vironmental Policy Act; 
(2) supports the continued enforcement of 
longstanding legal requirements of the Na-
tional Environmental Policy Act, including 
the required consideration of climate change 
when developing and planning Federal infra-
structure projects; and 
(3) opposes the Trump administration’s on-
going efforts to undermine the National En-
vironmental Policy Act through the regu-
latory process.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Christopher 
Diaz for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Christopher Diaz is a student at Jefferson 
High School and received this award because

him to overcome adversities.

Diaz is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels

ture accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING SGM KEVIN MILLER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
today I recognize SGM Kevin Miller, of the 
United States Army for his extraordinary dedi-
cation and service to our Nation. SGM Miller 
is retiring after over 30 outstanding years of 
service. 
SGM Miller answered the call to serve our 
great Nation in March of 1990 as a Non-com-
munications Interceptor and Analyst. SGM Mil-
ler has had an impressive career and has held 
every leadership position from team leader to 
Command Sergeant Major. His service took 
him all over the world, including assignments 
to Germany, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Baghdad. 
His service earned him numerous accolades, 
such as the Military Intelligence Corps’ 
Knowlton Award, the National Military Intel-
ligence Association’s Academic Excellence 
Award, and the Bronze Star Medal. 
On behalf of a grateful Nation, it is my 
honor to recognize the selfless service and 
sacrifice of SGM Miller. I hope he enjoys his 
well-deserved retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LIEUTENANT COLONEL NENG 
VANG 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Lieutenant 
Colonel Neng Vang, a true American hero and 
inspiration to many throughout North Caro-
lina’s Eighth Congressional District. 
Lt.Col. Vang was born on January 5, 1942 
in Phuv Luam, Xieng Khouang Province, Laos. 
After graduating from Nai Leoui Dong Heng 
Military Academy in 1963, he felt compelled to 
defend his country from the rising threat of 
communist forces. 
Lt.Col. Vang proved to be instrumental in 
many American operations throughout the re-
gion and assisted the U.S. Central Intelligence 
Agency (CIA) in rescuing fallen American pi-
lots, securing U.S. radar stations, and pre-
venting Northern Vietnamese assets from 
reaching South Vietnam. He served alongside 
the United States at great personal risk until 
the fall of Laos on May 15, 1975. 
Following the war, Lt.Col. Vang led a ref-
ugee camp in Thailand where he established 
post offices, implemented a system of law and 
justice, and provided valuable vocational train-
ing to fellow refugees. 
Lt.Col. Vang fled with his family to the 
United States on December 24, 1982 and later 
settled in Troy, North Carolina. He became an 
American citizen on April 2, 1993 and dedi-
cated the remainder of his life to the preserva-
tion of Hmong heritage and tradition. 
I am honored to join our community today in 
remembering his remarkable life and service. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Lieutenant 
Colonel Neng Vang.

HONORING ANA POTTRATZ 
ACOSTA 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Ana Pottratz Acosta, a tireless attorney, 
advocate, and organizer, as she receives the 
International Institute of Minnesota’s Olga 
Zoltai Award. I cannot imagine a better person 
to be recognized with this award. 
Ms. Pottratz Acosta wears many hats in the 
Twin Cities—a clinical instructor at Mitchell- 
Hamline School of Law, vice chair of the re-
gional American Immigration Lawyers Associa-
tion chapter, a pro-bono mentor at the Advo-
cates for Human rights, and more. She’s also 
at the forefront of community response to 
major immigration policy changes, such as the 
Central American Minors refugee program and 
the recent Liberian Refugee Immigration Fair-
ness Act. Connecting these threads is a deep 
passion for immigration justice—a commitment 
that our openness and acceptance of immi-
grants and refugees is a non-negotiable prin-
ciple of our country. Ms. Pottratz Acosta has 
approached this work not as a savior—but 
rather a partner in our common fight for libera-
tion. 
To me, Ms. Pottratz Acosta represents the 
best parts of America: someone who is using 
all the tools at her disposal to fight for a world 
that is more filled with love, more connected, 
and more beautiful. When I see Ms. Pottratz 
Acosta, I also see in her face the faces of all 
the immigrants she has helped start a better 
life in our community. Because of her, I know 
that our future is brighter. 
I thank Ms. Pottratz Acosta for her service 
to our community. It is an honor to get to work 
alongside her for justice for all of our neigh-
bors.

women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Esther Baum 
of West Hollywood, California. 
Esther was born and raised in Los Angeles 
and has called West Hollywood home for the 
past thirty years. Upon graduating from high 
school, Ms. Baum attended college and ma-
jored in accounting. With an abundance of tal-
ent and skill, Esther had a successful career

manufacturer, women’s sportswear shop, a 
beauty salon chain and an oral surgery prac-
tice. She retired in 2017. 
While Ms. Baum had a successful career, 
she never lost sight of the importance of vol-
unteering and giving back to the community. 
Esther volunteered at a cancer center in Santa 
Monica, California where she reconstructed 
the files and payroll records after the building 
caught on fire. She also volunteered at Project 
Angel Food, The Maple Counseling Center in 
Beverly Hills, and AARP, where she did tax 
preparation for senior citizens. 
At ninety-four years old, Esther continues to 
be a dynamic force in the community. She is 
currently serving on the City of West Holly-
wood Senior Advisory Board and is active in 
the West Hollywood Seniors in Action pro-
gram, where she plans programs for senior 
citizens to come together, make friends and 
share memories. In addition, Esther is a 
Neighborhood Watch block captain in her area 
and enjoys hosting National Night Out gath-
erings in her neighborhood, which she has 
done for the past twenty-nine years. She has 
made it a tradition to take all the remaining 
food to serve to the homeless. Esther is also 
a longtime and valued member of Congrega-
tion Kol Ami. 
Esther and her late husband, Robert, have 
one daughter who followed in Esther’s foot-
steps and is an accountant. 
The entire community has benefitted im-
mensely from the generosity and invaluable 
contributions of Ms. Baum. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 
28th 
Congressional 
District, 
Esther 
Baum.

CELEBRATING CHARLY SKAGGS 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
celebrate the extraordinary work and legacy of 
Charly Skaggs, who has led a life of continual 
service to the state of Texas. His leadership, 
vision, and commitment to hard work has 
made a difference to countless lives within 
Williamson County. 
Charly’s three-plus decades of public serv-
ice have helped grow the juvenile services de-
partment in Williamson County into the pro-
gram it is today. Knowing the hardships of 
being a small department with limited re-
sources, Charly devoted his leadership abili-
ties to staying on the cutting edge of programs 
and brought a state-of-the-art juvenile service 
department to his beloved community. His ef-
forts speak to the dedication of an innovator 
unafraid to embrace the challenges of today in 
order to make a better tomorrow. 
Throughout his life, Charly has unselfishly 
devoted countless hours to help others with 
teambuilding workshops and to volunteer ef-
forts that serve the youth in his community. As 
Como Santa, he’s beloved by children of all 
ages as he works to support the military com-
munity of Central Texas during the holiday 
season. His commitment to investing his gifts, 
talents, and abilities in service of his nation is 
a deeply held creed that speaks to the gen-
erosity of a true and devoted leader. 
Many go through life wondering if they’ve 
made a difference; Charly Skaggs doesn’t 
have that problem. He’s led Williamson Coun-
ty to new heights and has helped lead many 
individuals into a brighter future. I salute his 
work, congratulate him on his achievements, 
and wish him nothing but the best for his well- 
deserved retirement.

HONORING GEORGE J. LEDERER 
HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is my honor 
and privilege to mark a tremendous milestone 
for one of my constituents, George J. Lederer, 
who is celebrating his 100th birthday on March 
21, 2020. 
George J. Lederer was born on March 21, 
1920, in Vienna, Austria, to Felix and Helene 
Lederer. At the age of 18, he left Vienna and 
went, via Zurich, Switzerland, to England. He 
lived in Leicester until May 10, 1940, when, as 
a refugee, he was interned under General Or-
ders in Edinburgh, Scotland. Transferred to a 
larger camp near Huyton, George was de-
tained for approximately 8 weeks. He was 
subsequently transported to Australia on July 
10, where he remained in internment camps 
for nearly two years. After his return to the 
United Kingdom, in September 1942, George 
lived in Leicester and London, employed by an 
Indian railway company, until his U.S. Immi-
gration visa was ready. 
In July 1942, he left England and was land-
ed, unexpectedly, in Halifax, Canada, from 
where he finally entered the United States of 
America in Van Buren, Maine on July 30, l943. 
Rejoining his family in New York City, George 
eventually enrolled in the College of the City 
of New York, and graduated with a Bachelor 
of Engineering degree in 1951. George later 
earned the designation of ‘‘Professional Engi-
neer’’. 
After various positions in engineering design 
and construction work, he formed his own 
firm, George J. Lederer Construction Service 
Inc. in Scarsdale, NY, which engaged in mili-
tary and civilian work. He retired in 2002. 
George plans to celebrate his birthday among 
his family and friends. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
George J. Lederer on this special occasion. I 
wish George a happy birthday, and many 
more happy and healthy years to come.

Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Ashley Kucler is a student at Arvada West

Kucler is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Ash-
ley Kucler for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

TRIBUTE TO CLAIRE BOGAARD— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize 
a 
remarkable 
woman, 
Claire 
Bogaard of Pasadena, California. 
Born and raised in San Francisco, Claire 
Whalen attended the University of San Diego, 
where she obtained her Bachelor of Arts in 
History. She and her husband, Bill Bogaard 
married in 1961, lived overseas and in various 
cities in the United States before moving to 
Pasadena in 1970. 
Claire has made her mark in the community 
through her stellar leadership in the historic 
preservation arena. She is a Founding Mem-
ber of Pasadena Heritage, which was estab-
lished in 1976 and incorporated in 1977 by 
citizens who were concerned about the demo-
lition of historic structures in Pasadena. Now 
one of the largest preservation groups in Cali-
fornia, its mission is to identify, preserve and 
protect the architectural, historic and cultural 
resources of Pasadena through education and 
advocacy, and is best known for the preserva-
tion and rehabilitation of Old Pasadena, the 
once-derelict but now commercially successful 
original downtown, and the 1912 Colorado 
Street Bridge. Executive Director from 1981 to 
1993, Ms. Bogaard assisted with the creation 
of urban design guidelines and design plans 
for historic residential neighborhoods and 
commercial districts, obtaining historic preser-
vation easements and the nomination of build-
ings to the National Register of Historic 
Places. 
Some of the many organizations and com-
mittees Claire has served on include as an 
Advisor and Trustee for the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation, the California State His-
torical Resources Commission, Advisory Com-
mittee for the Restoration of Pasadena City 
Hall, St. Andrew Catholic Church Restoration 
Committee, Pasadena Planning Commission, 
Neighborhood Associations’ Board of Direc-
tors, and Chair of the No 710 Action Com-
mittee. Ms. Bogaard also chaired the effort to 
clean up and develop a Master Plan for Cen-
tral Park and the highly successful restoration 
of the ‘‘New Deal’’ era mural at McKinley 
School in Pasadena. In addition, Claire was a 
PTA President, a member of the Junior 
League of Pasadena and served on the Board

RECOGNIZING SHELLY & SANDS 
INC. 
HON. TROY BALDERSON 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to extend my congratulations to the en-
tire Shelly & Sands Inc. team of my home-
town, Zanesville, Ohio, on winning the Na-
tional Asphalt Pavement Associations’ Shel-
don G. Haynes Award. 
To be eligible for the Sheldon G. Haynes 
award, a paving company must first win the 
Pavement Associations Quality in Construction 
award for a project using more than 50,000 
tons of asphalt. Paving companies must sub-
mit projects from across the United States to 
be judged by an independent pavement con-
sultant. The projects are then judged on pave-
ment smoothness, safety, and durability, and 
innovative 
techniques 
used 
during 
the 
projects. Of the thousands of large-scale pav-
ing projects submitted every year, four compa-
nies are considered finalists and only one 
company wins. 
The I–77 roadway in Guernsey County, 
Ohio presented a unique paving challenge for 
the Shelly & Sands team. Shelly & Sands 
began paving in the middle of a bridge con-
struction project. The team used innovative 
thermal cameras to ensure even asphalt cool-
ing for surface smoothness and durability. This 
was just one of many masterful techniques 
used by the Shelly & Sands team to achieve 
success in this project. 
I again extend my warmest congratulations 
to the Shelly & Sands team on their pres-
tigious award. I look forward to hearing more 
about their future endeavors and wish them 
continued success in paving high quality, 
largescale projects throughout Ohio.

Lingen is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and

TRIBUTE TO DETECTIVE SHANNON 
GEANEY—28TH 
CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Detective 
Shannon Geaney of Hollywood, California. 
Detective Shannon Geaney is an exemplary 
career public servant. She served as an Offi-
cer in the United States Marine Corps and has 
over two decades of service with the Los An-
geles Police Department (LAPD). During her 
time in the Marine Corps, Shannon faced an 
inconceivable challenge during the initial years 
of the Global War on Terrorism, when she 
served as the Officer in Charge of the forward 
deployed Casualty Assistance and Hospital Li-
aison Teams in the hospitals tending to the in-
jured, ill and deceased Marines being evacu-
ated from Afghanistan and Iraq. Major Shan-
non Geaney’s information management data-
base and processes were so effective that the 
Department of Defense adapted and imple-
mented it as the Defense Casualty Information 
Processing System. 
Since her return to the LAPD in 2004, De-
tective Geaney has been a leader and worked 
on numerous issues with the LAPD. She tack-
led the issue of homelessness by volunteering 
to begin a unit to strategically and successfully 
address the issue; the unit is now known as 
Hollywood’s Coordinated Outreach Resource 
and Enforcement (CORE) Unit. Detective 
Geaney spearheaded the design of the Arch-
angel Critical Asset Management System that 
identifies and protects critical infrastructure 
and key resources in the Los Angeles metro-
politan area. The system’s overarching goal is 
to defend likely targets against terrorist attacks 
through inter-agency/departmental cooperation 
and coordination. In addition, Shannon worked 
for a decade as a member of the Los Angeles 
Regional Internet Crimes Against Children 
Task Force, where by her immersion into the 
disturbing world of child sexual exploitation, 
she saved thousands of innocent victims with 
a nearly 100 percent conviction rate on the 
search warrants and arrests effected by the 
task force. Last year in 2019, Shannon was 
promoted to Detective III at the Hollywood Di-
vision and placed in charge of both the CORE 
Unit and the Narcotics Enforcement Detail, 
whose cooperative strategy was due in part to 
Detective Geaney’s innovation and candid as-
sessment of the convergence of mental illness 
and addiction as a dominant factor in the 
homeless crisis. 
Detective Geaney is a remarkable role 
model, and proud resident of the community in 
which she serves. She is a member of The 
American Legion Hollywood Post 43 and vol-
unteers with the non-profit organization, Arts 
Bridging the Gap which creates murals 
through curriculum that offers arts enrichment 
for youth in under-served areas. These com-
munity art pieces are sources of pride to the 
community and help foster connections be-
tween the youth and police officers. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Detective 
Shannon Geaney.

IN HONOR OF KATHY L. SEAVER 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Kathy L. Seaver, who is being honored 
today for her retirement after 45 years of serv-
ice to the Town of Farmington. She has 
served as tax collector since 1974 and be-
came the joint town clerk and tax collector in 
1979. Kathy has served the Town of Farm-
ington with distinction and is revered by her 
peers for her expertise. 
Kathy L. Seaver was born and raised in 
Farmington, New Hampshire. She attended 
Farmington High School and what was then 
known as New Hampshire College. After grad-
uating in 1971, she joined multiple generations 
of her family who worked for the Town of 
Farmington, including her great-grandfather, 
grandmother, and mother. In 1974, Kathy was 
appointed tax collector. In 1979, she was 
elected to the joint role of tax collector and 
town clerk. Since 1990, Kathy has also served 
as the school district clerk. 
Throughout her career, Kathy has been an 
incredibly important member of her profes-
sional community. She was the first vice presi-
dent of the New Hampshire Tax Collectors’ 
Association Executive Board in 1982. Kathy 
then served as president in 1983 and became 
director-at-large in 1984. Since 1985, she has 
served as the director of public relations. 
Since 1992, Kathy has served as the chair-
person of the NHTCA/NHCTCA Joint Certifi-
cation Program. She graduated in 2000 from 
the State of New Hampshire Certified Public 
Managers Program and was one of the first 
two town clerk-tax collectors to do so. Kathy 
has also been an active member of the New 
Hampshire City & Town Clerks’ Association 
Executive Board, serving in multiple roles. 
As a dedicated public servant, Kathy has 
been awarded a multitude of honors. Kathy’s 
hard work and dedication has been recog-
nized by several New Hampshire public offi-
cials. Kathy has also received awards from

CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Mary O’Keefe 
of La Crescenta, California. 
Mary O’Keefe is an esteemed community 
volunteer and reporter for the Crescenta Val-
ley Weekly, and her contributions, both per-
sonal and professional, have positively im-
pacted the lives of many people in the greater 
La Crescenta community. 
A consummate volunteer, Ms. O’Keefe’s 
contributions to her community date back to 
being a Girl Scouts troop leader when her 
daughters were young. As an enthusiastic 
Parent Teacher Association (PTA) member 
and room mom, she quickly became known as 
a sought-after volunteer for whatever events 
and activities the PTA was planning. When 
her son was attending high school, Mary be-
came a vital member of Prom Plus, a non- 
profit organization which holds a supervised 
after-prom event for Crescenta Valley High 
School seniors as well as their guests. When 
her daughter voiced interest in establishing a 
youth arm, Prom Plus Club, she became the 
club’s mentor and oversaw hundreds of stu-
dents as they implemented volunteer tasks in 
the community and helped create the scholar-
ship program for members of the Prom Plus 
Club. Ms. O’Keefe remains active in both 
Prom Plus and Prom Plus Club to this day. 
Mary founded the Fire House Youth Center 
in La Crescenta, which welcomes youth to 
congregate and spend time with each other in 
a safe place. Under Ms. O’Keefe’s mentorship, 
youth are encouraged to establish their own 
programs such as Girl Empowerment Day, ca-
reer night and college information night. In 
2016, youth skateboarders from the Fire 
House worked with Los Angeles County and 
designed their own skate park at Crescenta 
Valley Park. 
In addition, Mary also serves on the 
Crescenta Valley Prayer Breakfast Committee 
and Crescenta Valley Fire Safe Council Board, 
and helped create the local community news-
paper, the Crescenta Valley Weekly, where 
she oversees a staff of reporters who write for 
the newspaper, while being a main contrib-
uting writer herself on in-depth stories. 
A devoted wife and mother, Mary and her 
husband Mark have three children: Charly, 
Molly and Jessy. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 
28th

RECOGNIZING THE INAUGURAL 
HEALTH LAW WEEK 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the inaugural ‘‘Health Law 
Week,’’ a week-long series of events cele-
brating the health law profession by high-
lighting programs that create new opportuni-
ties for entry into the profession, showcasing 
organizations and firms dedicated to employ-
ing these professionals and elevating this 
community’s contributions to the health care 
industry. 
Sponsored by the American Health Law As-
sociation, Health Law Week will take place 
this year from April 27 through May 1, with re-
ceptions hosted in Los Angeles, California, 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, St. Louis, Mis-
souri, and, of course, Washington, D.C., 
where the American Health Law Association 
has resided for over 50 years. Additional com-
munity events will also take place across the 
nation in celebration of the health law profes-
sional. 
With the landscape continuing to shift 
around delivery of care in the United States 
healthcare system, health law professionals 
are at the center, providing analysis, assess-
ing risk, ensuring compliance and making rec-
ommendations to organizations and clients to 
protect them from liability. They are a stabi-
lizing force within the industry, and we should 
celebrate and champion these professionals. 
Health Law Week not only serves to cele-
brate the health law profession, but it also rec-
ognizes the rich history of health care delivery 
in our nation. In 1965, Medicare was enacted 
as Title XVIII of the Social Security Act, pro-
viding federally funded and administered 
health insurance coverage for the elderly 
through Part A and Part B of the Act. Medicaid 
was enacted at the same time as Title XIX of 
the Social Security Act, creating a voluntary 
federal-state program of medical assistance to 
the indigent and so began the need for health 
law professionals. 
Today, the American Health Law Associa-
tion helps educate and connect over 60,000 
health law professionals across the country, 
with over 6,000 of them residing here in the 
District of Columbia metropolitan area. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the 
House of Representative to join me in recog-
nizing Health Law Week and acknowledge the 
impact and contributions of the health law pro-
fession on the nation’s healthcare system.

Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Susana 
Reyes of Glendale, California. 
Susana graduated magna cum laude from 
Saint Paul College with a degree in Commu-
nications. She earned a Civic Engagement 
Leadership and Management certification from 
the University of California, Los Angeles 
(UCLA) Anderson School of Management and 
a Government Purchasing and Contract Ad-
ministration credential from George Wash-
ington University. 
Susana Reyes has dedicated her life to 
working on issues that impact the environ-
ment, both in her personal life and profes-
sional career. As a Sierra Club leader and ac-
tivist, she is an advocate for the greater Los 
Angeles community in environmental justice 
issues. Ms. Reyes supported the successful 
battle against a large residential development 
in the Verdugo Mountains of Glendale and 
helped pause the Glendale gas plant expan-
sion in favor of exploring clean energy alter-
natives. She was the Political Chair of the Si-
erra Club Angeles Chapter, a member of their 
National Political Team, and served on the Si-
erra Club’s Political Action Committee. Susana 
was an elected member of the Sierra Club Na-
tional Board of Directors where she served as 
Vice President, was elected to the Board’s Ex-
ecutive Committee and currently is the na-
tional volunteer co-lead for the Clean Trans-
portation for All campaign. In addition to her 
service with the Sierra Club, in 2019, she was 
appointed by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti 
to the Board of Commissioners of the Los An-
geles 
Department 
of Water and Power 
(LADWP) making her the first Filipino-Amer-
ican LADWP Commissioner. 
Ms. Reyes is the founder and CEO of 
AgilEngines LLC, a consulting and advocacy 
firm with a focus on civic engagement strate-
gies and community outreach. Prior to this, 
she was a Senior Sustainability Analyst at the 
Los Angeles Mayor’s office, where she played 
an essential role in launching the first Sustain-
able City Plan and was responsible for secur-
ing a $1.7 million grant from the California Air 
Resources Board for the first-ever electric car 
share program specifically designated for low- 
income communities. Previous positions also 
include serving as Manager of the City of Los 
Angeles Facilities Recycling Program and 
Human Resources Director at the LADWP. 
For 
her 
outstanding 
accomplishments, 
Susana has received the City of Los Angeles 
Career Service Award, the Sierra Club Polit-
ical Service Award, the Sierra Club Phil 
Bernays Award, the Rotary Club Bay Area 
Women Leaders Award, and the Women in 
Business Environmental Leader Award. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-

YOUTH, PEACE, AND SECURITY 
ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Youth, 
Peace, and Security Act, the first comprehen-
sive legislation that would prioritize the inclu-
sion of youth in conflict resolution. 
There are more than 1.8 billion youth in the 
world. Whether here in the U.S. or abroad, 
youth populations have long been at the fore-
front of building peace in their communities by 
creating youth-led movements, organizations, 
and networks to mitigate negative effects of 
conflict and to prevent recurring cycles of vio-
lence. Inclusive peace processes are proven 
to more holistically address the root causes of 
violence and lead to more sustainable peace. 
Not only is it important to include youth in 
conflict resolution for the sake of inclusivity, it 
has also been proven to lead to more sustain-
able peace. For example, Somali Youth Learn-
ers Initiative (‘‘SYLI’’) was created to improve 
Somali youths’ access to education and to 
promote civic engagement. After learning lead-
ership and nonviolent conflict resolution skills 
through the program, the students were able 
to implement their own youth-led community 
projects and communicate effectively with poli-
ticians about policies that impact youth. Youth 
who gained access to improved secondary 
school and civic engagement opportunities 
through SYLI and the community projects 
were 65 percent less likely to demonstrate 
moral or material support for political violence. 
My bill will codify the roles of a Youth Coor-
dinator at USAID and Youth Points of Contact 
in relevant bureaus; integrate youth consulta-
tion into program design; and provide financial 
and technical assistance to youth-led initia-
tives in pursuit of conflict resolution and 
peacebuilding. 
The Youth, Peace, and Security Act is a 
once-in-a-generation shift in U.S. foreign pol-
icy that would bring youth voices to the table 
in conflicts around the world. In countries fac-
ing conflict, it will be the young people who 
will bear the burden of sustaining peace over 
generations, leading their society from rec-
onciliation to prosperity. 
I am thrilled to be joined in leading this bill 
by my colleagues, Representatives SUSAN 
BROOKS, DEAN PHILLIPS, and JOHN CURTIS, 
and am grateful to our other colleagues who 
have supported this introduction. My bill is 
also endorsed by over 35 non-governmental 
organizations. I urge the House of Represent-
atives to join me in passing this important leg-
islation.

Howard Blackburn is perhaps best known 
throughout Wilkes County for his contributions 
to beekeeping. He helped found the Bee-
keepers of Wilkes, and personally served as 
an instructor and mentor for decades. He 
helped many, many other people understand 
the importance of bees to our lives. He always 
maintained the highest standards of meticu-
lous conduct and expected others to strive to 
the same level of excellence. Howard Black-
burn is a shining example of service that we 
should all seek to emulate.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
salute the extraordinary career of Mike Stan-
ford as he retires from a lifetime of civic in-
volvement. Mike devoted nearly four decades 
of incredible service to communities through-
out the State of Texas through his career in 
the television industry. With his ‘‘what can I do 
to help?’’ spirit and high-minded vision, he’s 
made Central Texas a model for child-focused

in need. Through his tireless work and altru-
istic leadership, he created Camo Santa that 
focused on providing toys for soldier families 
in financial need. Mike’s contributions. to his 
community doesn’t stop there. He has orga-
nized several programs to help serve others, 
such as numerous Dallas Cowboys Charity 
events, Wednesday’s Child, Criswell’s Kids, 
and Adopt a Pet. Mike’s dedication to service 
and hard work has helped make a difference 
in many lives from providing children with 
basic supplies to helping those impacted by 
natural 
disasters. 
His 
generous 
activism 
speaks to the very best of Texas values. 
Mike’s commitment to the highest standards 
of excellence has not gone unnoticed. Recog-
nized by his colleagues for his devotion and 
hard work, he has achieved a long list of ac-
colades, including four Emmy Awards, twelve 
Addy Awards, the Dallas Press Club’s Katy 
Award, as well as high recognition from the 
Texas Association of Broadcasters as recipi-
ent of the Bonner McClain Service Award. 
Mike’s resume speaks to an innovator unafraid 
to do what it takes to excel in a demanding 
profession. 
Mike Stanford’s generous commitment to 
helping others serves as an inspiration for all 
to follow. There’s no doubt that Central Texas 
is a better place because of him. I heartily sa-
lute his work and wish him the best of luck in 
his richly deserved retirement.

TRIBUTE TO JANET WORKMAN— 
28TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
WOMAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Women’s History Month. Each 
year, we pay special tribute to the contribu-
tions and sacrifices made by our nation’s 
women. It is an honor to pay homage to out-
standing women who are making a difference 
in my Congressional District. I would like to 
recognize a remarkable woman, Janet Work-
man of the Elysian Valley neighborhood of Los 
Angeles, California. 
Janet Workman is a devoted wife and com-
munity leader in Elysian Valley. Ms. Workman 
was born and raised in Hermosa Beach and 
briefly lived in Sao Paolo, Brazil as an ex-
change student during her teenage years. 
While attending the University of Southern 
California, she majored in French, after which 
she spent several years teaching French and 
English at the high school level. She then 
moved to the City of Pasadena in 1981, where 
she started her career in corporate and emer-
gency planning. An expert in her field, she ran 
her own company for twenty years before 
working for Southern California Edison. Addi-
tionally, she volunteered for eight years as a 
docent at the historic Gamble House and 
seven years on the board of a domestic vio-
lence shelter. Despite her full and active life in 
Pasadena, she and her husband, Robert, de-
cided to relocate to Elysian Valley to start a 
new chapter in their lives. 
Ms. Workman built a new sense of home in 
Elysian Valley for herself and her husband. 
Never one to sit idly by, she started the 
Frogtown Art Walk with a group of neighbors, 
of which she was an essential planner for sev-
eral years. To ensure the Art Walk’s success, 
she and Robert converted a small home into 
a meeting place for the event which eventually 
became the social hub for the entire neighbor-
hood. A lover of art, she studied botanical 
drawing and watercolor, and produced her 
own stained-glass art that was exhibited at the 
Frogtown Art Walk. 
Ms. Workman was also instrumental in re-
storing the Elysian Valley Community Garden, 
where she took a hands-on approach to re-
build the garden back into a resource for local 
residents. She took charge of the restoration 
by building and painting a tool shed, helping to 
construct planting beds, and enlisted the City 
of Los Angeles to donate trees for the gar-
den’s orchard. 
Janet is currently a board member of 
Friends of Silver Lake Library, a volunteer 
group dedicated in supporting special pro-
grams and cultural events at this branch of the 
Los Angeles Public Library. As a very active 
board member, Ms. Workman has increased 
the library’s programs for children and helped 
to organize the library’s 10-year anniversary 
celebration. 
The Elysian Valley community and beyond 
has benefitted greatly from the generosity of 
Ms. Workman. With a focus on giving back, 
she has played a vital role in energizing her 
fellow community members to start their own 
neighborhood projects and organizations. 
I ask all Members to join me in honoring this 
exceptional, well-respected woman of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Janet Work-
man.

COMMEMORATING 
40 
YEARS 
OF 
COMMUNITY 
FOOD 
BASKET 
IN 
IDAHO FALLS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate 40 years of the Community 
Food Basket in Idaho Falls. This is an excep-
tional organization that is committed to fighting 
food insecurity in southeast Idaho. 
In 1980, various members of the Idaho Falls 
community took it upon themselves to launch 
an effort aimed at securing emergency neces-
sities for their church membership. Today, four 
decades later, the efforts of these selfless 
men and women continue to expand in the 
Idaho Falls area. Helping more than 4,000 in-
dividuals monthly, the Community Food Bas-
ket of Idaho Falls serves the public with a 
noble vision of meeting the needs of those 
who face food insecurity. 
In 2019 alone, the Community Food Basket 
served over 100,000 people and gave away 
$2.6 million dollars of food in order to provide 
struggling neighbors with life-saving essen-
tials. Hundreds of volunteers have sacrificed 
their time and resources and hundreds of 
businesses have participated in food drives to 
support those around us in need. 
Not only has the Food Basket provided 
countless members of our community with 
what they need to survive, but they have also 
highlighted the altruistic, selfless spirit so com-
mon in Idaho. 
Madam Speaker, the Community Food Bas-
ket of Idaho Falls is a staple in my community. 
It is my privilege to applaud this great organi-
zation and its selfless volunteers.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
KATHERINE JOHNSON 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 10, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the late Katherine John-
son, one of the first African American women 
ever to work at NASA, whose brilliant mind 
and countless contributions helped to make 
both flight in space and our space center in 
Huntsville, Alabama, possible. 
Mrs. Johnson spent thirty-five years at 
NASA, during which time she used her re-
markable mind to master even the most com-
plex manual calculations and helped to pio-
neer the early use of computers. Her work 
was instrumental to launching Alan Shepard, 
the first American in space and John Glenn, 
the first American in orbit. Mrs. Johnson 
worked at NASA during a time when African 
American women were largely banned from 
taking advantage of such career opportunities, 
however, her grit, determination and indubi-
table brilliance helped her to persist, tearing 
down barriers for African Americans and for 
women. 
At eighteen, Mrs. Johnson enrolled at the 
historically black West Virginia State College, 
where she found a mentor in math professor 
W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African 
American to earn a PhD in mathematics. She 
graduated with highest honors in 1937 and 
took a job teaching at an African American 
public school in Virginia. 
In 1939, West Virginia State’s president, Dr. 
John W. Davis, selected Mrs. Johnson and 
two other African American men to be the first 
black students to attend West Virginia Univer-
sity, which was historically white. Mrs. John-
son resigned from her teaching job and en-
rolled in the graduate math program to be-
come a full-time student. She did not complete 
her degree, deciding instead to leave school 
to start a family with her first husband, James 
Goble. She returned to teaching when her 
children got older. 
In 1952, a relative told Mrs. Johnson about 
a job opportunity at the all-black West Area 
Computing section at the National Advisory 
Committee for Aeronautics’ (NACA’s) Langley 
laboratory. Mrs. Johnson and her husband de-
cided to move the family to Newport News, 
Virginia, to pursue the opportunity, and Kath-
erine began work at Langley in the summer of 
1953. Just two weeks into her tenure in the of-
fice, she was assigned to a project in the Ma-
neuver Loads Branch of the Flight Research 
Division. She spent the next four years ana-
lyzing data from flight tests and worked on the 
investigation of a plane crash caused by wake 
turbulence. Just as she was completing this 
work, her husband died of cancer in Decem-
ber 1956. 
In 1957, Russia launched Sputnik, the first 
successful satellite to be launched into space, 
and the United States immediately began ef-
forts to beat Russia and become the first 
country to put a man into space. Mrs. Johnson 
was selected to provide math for ‘‘Notes on 
Space Technology,’’ a collection formed by 
NACA engineers who became part of NASA 
when that agency was formed in 1958. 
Mrs. Johnson went on to do the trajectory 
analysis for America’s first human space flight 
by astronaut Alan Shepard in 1961. She 
worked closely with Ted Skopinksi, a male en-
gineer, to co-author ‘‘Determination of Azimuth 
Angle at Burnout for Place a Satellite Over a 
Selected Earth Position,’’ a report on the 
equations for an orbital spaceflight with a land-
ing site target. It was the first time a woman 
in NASA’s Flight Research Division received 
credit for authoring a research report. 
In 1962, John Glenn was preparing for his 
orbital flight and was hesitant to trust the new 
computers’ calculation of his orbital trajectory. 
He relied on Mrs. Johnson to cite her calcula-
tions on syncing the Apollo Lunar Model with 
the orbiting Command and Service Module. 
This was known as Mrs. Johnson’s greatest 
contribution. After this successful event, she 
authored and co-authored 26 research reports 
before retiring in 1986. Mrs. Johnson was then 
awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom 
by President Barack Obama, and played by 
Taraji P. Henson in the movie ‘‘Hidden Fig-
ures’’ about NASA’s black women pioneers. 
Mrs. Johnson fought through discrimination 
and adversity, proving to America and to the 
entire world not only that African Americans 
were just as capable as white Americans, but 
that women were just as capable as men. In 
many ways, she displayed even more patriot-
ism, as she overcame adversity in order to 
serve her country. Katherine Johnson’s legacy 
is one that should make the state of Alabama 
truly proud. She is a part of Alabama’s re-
markable legacy of advocating for civil rights, 
proving that the determination of African 
American women can charge the course of 
history, not only for our country but for the en-
tire world. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Alabama’s 
7th Congressional District, I ask you and my 
colleagues to join me in paying tribute to the 
exemplary service of Katherine Johnson. May 
we celebrate her resilience and sacrifice every 
day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

March 10, 2020 
In 1946, Dottie graduated from MacMurray 
College in Jacksonville, Ill. where she earned 
a bachelor’s degree and a Master of Arts de-
gree from the University of Illinois in 1949. 
After coming to Colorado in 1950, and then 
moving to Denver in 1953, Dottie’s interest in 
politics was sparked. In 1952, she worked for 
Dwight Eisenhower’s presidential campaign 
collecting contributions, which irritated both 
her family and Bob’s family as they were 
backers of the more conservative Robert Taft 
of Ohio. She then took an interest in immuni-
zation issues, which brought her to Montrose, 
Delta and Mesa counties where she helped to 
organize immunization drives. Dottie continued 
to pursue her interest in public health and 
worked for a federal agency for 10 years. She 
also led the Colorado Civil Rights Commission 
from 1972 to 1980 and served on the boards 
of several metro area mental health organiza-
tions. 
In 1984, Dottie was first elected to the Colo-
rado State House. She was appointed to the 
Colorado State Senate when Sen. Cliff Dodge 
stepped down in November 1987. She won 
election to that seat the following year, and 
handily won re-election twice more. During 
Dottie’s tenure at the legislature she chaired 
the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1989 to 
2000. Her legislative focus remained centered 
on her passion for health policy, including 
mental health issues. Dottie was term-limited 
in 2000. 
She was one of the first state lawmakers to 
carry legislation requiring reporting of HIV and 
AIDS in Colorado. Dottie’s bill, Senate Bill 157 
in 1990, laid down a marker for how individ-
uals with HIV or AIDS should be treated, stat-
ing that any such infection should not serve as 
the basis for discrimination or prevention of 
access to services. 
I was privileged to know Dottie for many 
years and to call her my friend. It was an 
honor to work with her in the Colorado State 
Senate. I admired her focus and effectiveness. 
She never shied away from a tough challenge. 
She was one of the smartest, toughest, 
shrewdest and kindest people I have ever 
met, and I appreciated her tireless work ethic 
and service to the people of Colorado. I ex-
tend my deepest appreciation to Dottie Wham 
for her dedication to her community and to the 
people of the State of Colorado.
