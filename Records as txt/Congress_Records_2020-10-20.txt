PRAYER 
Dr. Haywood A. Robinson, III, The 
People’s Community Baptist Church, 
Silver Spring, Maryland, offered the 
following prayer: 
Eternal God, the source, sustainer, 
and supplier of everything pertaining 
to life, it is to You that we come this 
morning. Before You, Who, from noth-
ing, created soil, seas, and skies, and 
Who established galaxies, groves, and 
governments, we come. We approach 
You with gratitude, mindful that as a 
Nation we have enjoyed Your provi-
dential presence, protection, power, 
and prosperity. And, for all of our indi-
vidual and corporate wrongs, we repent 
and appeal to You for Your mercy. 
On behalf of the people of this land, 
Your appointed men and women assem-
ble at this hour. We are keenly aware 
of the significance of the season in 
which this session convenes. In this 
season marked by darkness, we need 
Your light; marked by hatred, we need 
Your love; by disease, we need Your 
healing; by death, we need Your com-
fort; by despair, we need Your hope; by 
injustice, we need Your justice; and by 
lawlessness, Lord, we need Your grace. 
Grant these leaders the discernment to 
recognize Your will and the discipline 
to follow it. 
As a melting pot of cultures, lan-
guages, ideologies, and faith traditions, 
help us to coexist in unity while cele-
brating diversity. Guard and govern us 
such that our plurality leads, not to 
our peril, but to our promise and 
progress. 
Shape the atmosphere for us today to 
be one that is ripe for robust yet re-
spectful discussion, debate, and deci-
sion making, resulting in legislation 
that promotes and protects the worth 
and welfare of each person in our great 
Nation, and by extension all people 
throughout the world, both now and for 
generations to come. 
In Jesus’ name. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

October 20, 2020 
IN 
HONOR 
OF 
NAUGHTAVEEL 
FARM 
RECEIVING 
THE 
GREEN 
PASTURES AWARD 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Naughtaveel Farm on West 
Side Road in North Conway. Run by Justin 
and Julie Hussey, it opened as a gentleman’s 
dairy farm in 1960, then became Naughtaveel 
Farm in 2014. This family farm produces qual-
ity New Hampshire products and is integral to 
continuing the Granite State’s rural tradition. 
When he moved to the Mount Washington 
Valley, Justin’s grandfather Eugene didn’t 
have much. But with his station wagon and 
$2,000 in his wallet, he bought properties to 
create the successful dairy farm Justin and 
Julie now operate. 
Justin and Julie’s grit and determination to 
keep Naughtaveel Farm open through the 
pandemic, while many of their customers and 
institutions closed, is commendable. Although 
they were provided relief funding to help sup-
port their business, it was truly the innovative 
spirit of the Hussey’s that made Naughtaveel 
Farm successful and the sole surviving dairy 
farm in Carroll County. The farm is consid-
ering a pasteurization micro dairy and has al-
ready opened a self-serve stand. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
congratulate Naughtaveel Farm on their well- 
deserved Green Pastures Award. The farm’s 
commitment to quality Granite State products

CAPTAIN WAYNE MAGWOOD 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Captain 
Wayne Magwood. Captain Magwood was a 
Lowcountry legend along Shem Creek for 
many years and his famed boat, the Winds of 
Fortune, has been a staple of the waters even 
decades before Magwood. He retired in July 
after trawling since the age of 12. 
Captain Magwood was featured in an epi-
sode of Dirty Jobs in 2005, and made subse-
quent appearances in Rucker’s ‘‘Come Back 
Song’’ video, and on The History Channel, 
The Weather Channel, and Amazing Race. He 
is credited with authentically representing the 
incredibly 
difficult 
work 
of 
Lowcountry 
shrimpers and fishermen. 
Captain Magwood was honored in 2011 by 
the Governor with The Order of the Palmetto 
award, South Carolina’s highest Civilian honor 
for extraordinary lifetime services. And what 
an extraordinary life Magwood lived, as a 
third-generation shrimper and a beloved men-
tor to the next generation of shrimpers. 
He has now been honored with the renam-
ing of the pedestrian bridge in Shem Creek. 
While the bridge will carry on Captain 
Magwood’s name, his legacy lives on in the 
many younger shrimpers he mentored and 
taught. I am thankful for his service to the 
Lowcountry and introducing our way of life to 
so many. My deepest sympathies are with the 
entire Magwood family and Shem Creek 
shrimping community.

HONORING 
THE 
100TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE DISABLED AMER-
ICAN VETERANS 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that 
I pay special tribute to the organization of Dis-
abled American Veterans (DAV). 
This year marks the 100th anniversary of 
the formation of this organization created by 
and for disabled American veterans on Sep-
tember 25, 1920. 
The DAV provides assistance to more than 
1 million veterans every year to connect them 
with healthcare, disability, employment, edu-
cation, and financial benefits they have earned 
through their military service. 
Puerto Rico joined the DAV in 1973 and has 
since faithfully endeavored to fulfill its mission 
of empowering veterans to lead high-quality 
lives with respect and dignity. 
This commendable organization has sub-
mitted more than 11.7 million claims nation-
wide for the past century on behalf of service 
members as they make critical transitions into 
civilian life. A transition that is particularly dif-
ficult to those returning home after enduring 
wars and are in special need of attention and 
care from our grateful nation. 
Sadly, this year alone, military suicides have 
increased by as much as 20 percent com-
pared to the same period in 2019 as members 
struggle under COVID–19, war zone deploy-
ments, national disasters, and civil unrest. 
The DAV not only provides a place of trust 
and compassion to our wounded veterans but 
most importantly a place to outreach veteran 
concerns before Congress and federal agen-
cies like the Department of Veterans to bring 
representation to these service members. 
On this day we pause to commemorate the 
100th Anniversary of the DAV, worthy of our 
gratitude to the sacrifice of countless men and 
women from all corners of our great nation 
who together with their brothers and sisters in 
arms from Puerto Rico, answered the call of 
freedom and the defense of Democracy 
around the World. 
Veterans need our help today as much as 
they did 100 years ago. For this reason, I’m 
proud to recognize the Disable American Vet-
eran on their 100th Anniversary and commend 
their outstanding support to America’s injured 
and ill veterans and their families.

INDEPENDENCE FOR ARTSAKH 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
regarding 
the 
ongoing 
conflict 
in 
Artsakh. 
Artsakh is a very American story—the vic-
tory of a free people over foreign rule. 
The citizens of this proud Republic embody 
the words of our own Declaration of Independ-
ence—which affirmed for Americans and all 
the world—that the just powers of government 
derive from the consent of the governed. 
To the well-known and thoroughly docu-
mented historical role of Artsakh as an integral 
part of Armenia going back thousands of 
years, we can add Artsakh’s strong legal 
standing as an independent Republic. 
But what matters most today—during an on-
going rain of rockets and bombs on Artsakh 
civilians by Azerbaijan and Turkey and their 
ISIS allies—is that freedom is not just about 
honoring history or enforcing the law. 
Freedom is the only answer left for 
Artsakh’s survival—History-based, law-based, 
survival-based remedial secession. 
There can be no going back. Artsakh must 
not return to Azerbaijan. 
The path forward is one of liberty, which is 
why I am today calling for official U.S. recogni-
tion of the Republic of Artsakh’s independ-
ence.

The Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church

people of faith from the greater Miami area for 
over a century. The church has provided sum-
mer camps and afterschool programs for chil-
dren, worked to feed the homeless, and as-
sisted families facing hardships. Rooted in the 
values of Ministry, Mission, and Service, the 
church is a valued and integral piece of our

I am deeply grateful to Macedonia Mis-

RECOGNIZING THE 10TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF DISTRACTED DRIVING 
MONTH 
HON. RAJA KRISHNAMOORTHI 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to join thousands of organizations 
and individuals around the country in observa-
tion of Distracted Driving Awareness Month. 
First recognized by Congress 10 years ago, 
this commemoration brings attention to the 
persistent problem of distraction on our Na-
tion’s roadways. 
More than 700 people still die or are injured 
every day in the U.S. as a result of distracted 
driving crashes. According to a recent survey 
released by the National Safety Council—a 
nonprofit based in my district—only 62 percent 
of drivers were ‘‘very willing’’ to obey state 
laws preventing cell phone use. This tells me 
drivers fail to see the dangers of distracted 
driving. 
Research shows that using electronic de-
vices increases cognitive distraction. This can 
be deadly on the road, where a split-second 
distraction can cause a crash. Approximately 
2,841 people died in distraction-affected driv-
ing crashes in 2018—that’s eight people every 
day dying from a completely preventable 
cause—and this is widely believed to be 
undercounted as many states do not include 
the option on crash reports to document dis-
tracted driving. We have to close these gaps, 
and that starts with raising awareness. 
Despite a decrease in traffic volume during 
the pandemic, crash fatality rates have risen 
at an alarming level, with estimates that the 
rate of death on our roadways was 20 percent 
higher in the first six months of 2020 versus 
the same time period last year. We’ve taken 
cars off the roads, but we haven’t reaped any 
safety benefit. 
Recognizing these dangerous trends, last 
year I was proud to introduce the SAFE TO 
DRIVE Act with my colleagues Mr. GALLAGHER 
and Mr. COHEN, to incentivize states to pass 
laws eliminating distraction on our roadways. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in supporting 
passage of this legislation. We need it now 
more than ever. 
As we mark the 10th Anniversary of Dis-
tracted Driving Awareness Month, I encourage 
all motorists to commit to driving attentively 
and safely and to avoid using cell phones and 
in-vehicle technology that take attention off the 
task of driving. I also hope my colleagues will 
join me this month in raising awareness about 
this important issue. Do it for all of our con-
stituents. Their lives are more valuable than 
any call, email, or text.

THE INTERNATIONAL UNION OF 
PAINTERS AND ALLIED TRADES 
(IUPAT) UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mark Guethle of the International 
Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT). 
With a long and illustrious career working for 
the citizens of North Aurora and Kane County, 
Mark has distinguished himself as a valuable

Mark has served as the Director of Govern-
ment Affairs of the Painters Union since the

been dedicated to advocating for working peo-
ple and their families. I have been lucky to 
work closely with him on a variety of labor 
issues to benefit working families in Illinois, 
and I am proud to call him my friend.

service to the people of Aurora and congratu-
lating him on a prominent career.

IN RECOGNITION OF DANIEL J. 
FORTE 
HON. RICHARD E. NEAL 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to recognize Mr. Daniel J. 
Forte as he completes his 35-year tenure with 
the Massachusetts Bankers Association. After 
joining the MBA in 1985, Daniel ascended to 
the position of President and CEO in 1997 
and has since developed close relationships 
with many bankers, lawmakers, and banking 
regulators in New England and across the 
country. 
Representing 72,000 employees across 130 
banks, his contribution to the New England 
banking community cannot be overstated. His 
accomplishments include working in conjunc-
tion with the Massachusetts Congressional 
Delegation to support the passage of the 2010 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Con-
sumer Protection Act, various pieces of bank-
ing modernization legislation, and the Emer-
gency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. He 
will be remembered by his colleagues for his 
leadership, integrity, strong faith, wit, and at-
tention to detail. 
I’m proud to recognize Daniel for his distin-
guished service to the Commonwealth of Mas-
sachusetts and the New England banking 
community, I wish him, his wife Stella, and 
their two children the best of luck in their fu-
ture endeavors. 
OPPOSITION TO THE NOMINATION 
OF AMY CONEY BARRETT AS AS-
SOCIATE JUSTICE OF SUPREME 
COURT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as 
senior member of the House Committee on 
the Judiciary, as citizen of the United States, 
as a mother, and as a African American 
woman I rise in my strong opposition to the 
nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to re-
place the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on 
the Supreme Court of the United States. 
I oppose this nomination because Judge 
Barrett’s extreme record on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, along with her 
ideologically driven writings and speeches, 
demonstrate that she is incapable of rendering 
equal justice under law. 
Judge Barrett is hostile to Roe v. Wade, 410 
U.S. 113 (1973), and to Supreme Court cases 
upholding the Affordable Care Act (‘‘ACA’’) 
and is being nominated to be the decisive vote 
on the Court to reverse these landmark rul-
ings, so that millions of people can be de-
prived of access to essential health care serv-
ices and abortion access. 
One highly respected legal commentator 
who has studied her record in depth called 
Judge Barrett’s record on the bench ‘‘fun-
damentally cruel’’ and said that she ‘‘has ei-
ther written or joined a remarkable number of 
opinions that harm unpopular and powerless 
individuals who rely on the judiciary to safe-
guard their rights.’’ 
The rush to confirm Judge Barrett is a key 
part of this impeached and dissembling presi-
dent’s corrupt scheme effort to avoid a peace-
ful transfer of power and remain in office at 
any cost. 
Indeed, the President recently admitted that 
he wanted a ninth justice in place because he 
believes the Supreme Court will end up decid-
ing the election winner, and he wants another 
loyalist on the Court to tip the scale in his 
favor. 
No justice confirmed under these cir-
cumstances would have legitimacy in a case 
bearing on the outcome of the presidential 
election, so it is troubling that Judge Barrett 
has not stated publicly that she will recuse 
herself from participating in any such case. 
By nearly a two-to-one margin, Americans 
believe that the winner of the upcoming presi-
dential election should fill the current Supreme 
Court vacancy. 
In this they are in lockstep agreement with 
the principle enunciated by Senate Majority 
Leader MCCONNELL on February 13, 2016, 
when he refused to even confirmation hear-
ings, much less a floor vote, for President 
Obama nomination of Judge Merrick Garland 
to succeed Justice Scalia: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new president. 
This principle was echoed by the current Ju-
diciary Chairman GRAHAM who stated in 2016: 
I want you to use my words against me. If 
there’s a Republican president in 2016 and a 
vacancy occurs in the last year of the first 
term, you can say Lindsey Graham said let’s

October 20, 2020 
let the next president, whoever it might be, 
make that nomination. 
Before she became the beneficiary of this 
180 degree reversal in principle, even Judge 
Barrett herself enthusiastically agreed with 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL
and Judiciary 
Committee Chairman GRAHAM that the Senate 
could and should refuse to advise and consent 
to a Supreme Court nomination made in an 
election year, especially where the nomination 
would alter the ideological balance of the 
Court. 
The legitimacy of the federal judiciary stems 
from the public’s faith that its decision-making 
is fair and impartial but the rush to confirm 
Judge Barrett will deeply tarnish the integrity 
and reputation of the Supreme Court. 
As a group of former federal judges coun-
seled in their letter to Senate leaders: 
Our nation is on the precipice of a national 
election and is in the grip of a global pan-
demic. Our citizenry is sharply polarized—a 
foreboding sign for the health of any democ-
racy. The judicial confirmation process has 
increasingly become dangerously politicized. 
Injecting a Supreme Court confirmation 
fight into this noxious mix will unalterably 
change and diminish the public’s faith in 
this vital institution. 
Let me now turn to the specific harm to the 
American people that will result if this nominee 
were to be confirmed as an Associate Justice 
of the Supreme Court. 
Judge Barrett is expected to be the deciding 
vote to strike down the constitutionality of the 
Affordable Care Act, or ‘‘ObamaCare,’’ depriv-
ing millions of people with access to health 
care amidst the worst public health crisis this 
nation has witnessed in over a hundred years. 
The ACA provides critical health care pro-
tections to millions of people, including an esti-
mated 130 million Americans with pre-existing 
conditions such as the seven million Ameri-
cans who have tested positive for COVID–19. 
If this crucial health care access is stripped 
away, it would have a particularly devastating 
impact on communities of color and people 
with disabilities; the rate of Black people who 
are uninsured would dramatically increase 20 
percent, and an estimated 5.4 million Latinos, 
2 million Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, 
and Pacific Islanders, and 300,000 Native 
Americans could lose coverage, and Ameri-
cans with disabilities would be particularly im-
pacted, with the uninsured rate for people with 
disabilities rising by up to 42 percent. 
Invalidation of the ACA would not only re-
move critical health care protections for people 
with pre-existing conditions and people with 
disabilities, it would disproportionately harm 
people of color and potentially jeopardize ac-
cess to a COVID–19 vaccine, the Medicaid 
expansion that has brought health care to tens 
of millions of people, critical nondiscrimination 
provisions, coverage for those under 26 who 
are currently on their parents’ health care in-
surance plan, insurance coverage for sub-
stance abuse treatment including opioid addi-
tion, and the removal of caps that insurance 
companies previously placed on expensive 
medical treatment. 
The Supreme Court is set to decide the fate 
of the ACA and its protections for people with 
pre-existing conditions this term and will hear 
oral arguments in California v. Texas. ll 
U.S. ll, No. 19–840 (2020)—the legal chal-
lenge to this vital law—on November 10, just 
one week after Election Day, and that is why 
the President and his Senate acolytes are 
rushing forward with this nomination to try to 
install Judge Barrett on the Court in time to kill 
the ACA, a feat they have tried but failed to 
accomplish 70 times through the legislative 
process. 
In Doe v. Purdue University, 928 F.3d 652 
(7th Cir. 2019), Judge Barrett wrote an opinion 
that allowed a male student—who was 
credibly accused of committing multiple sexual 
assaults and suspended from the university— 
to advance a Title IX lawsuit against the uni-
versity alleging he was discriminated against 
because he was a man. 
Judge Barrett’s ruling turned a sex discrimi-
nation statute on its head, using a law meant 
to prevent and address sexual assault to pro-
mote impunity for that very same behavior and 
will discourage universities from disciplining 
male perpetrators of sexual violence since 
doing so may result in their being sued for sex 
discrimination. 
Judge Barrett’s opinion in this case inti-
mated erroneously and intentionally that the 
U.S. Department of Education’s Obama-era 
2011 Title IX guidance calling on schools to 
take sexual harassment seriously resulted in 
discrimination against men—even though this 
guidance prohibited the unfair procedures the 
male student alleged he experienced. 
It is unconscionable that we are even con-
sidering replacing Justice Ginsburg’s legacy 
with a judge who is willing to allow sex dis-
crimination laws to be used as a sword for 
men rather than a shield to protect women. 
In the field of criminal justice and procedure, 
Judge Barrett’s judicial record raises serious 
questions about whether she would be fair to 
victims of law enforcement misconduct; she 
has regularly ruled for law enforcement and 
against defendants in criminal cases and peo-
ple in prison, often in dissent, reflecting her 
extreme views. 
For example, Judge Barrett dissented in 
United States v. Uriarte, No. 19–2092, 2020 
WL 5525119 (7th Cir. Sept. 15, 2020), where 
the Seventh Circuit, sitting en banc, applied 
the reduced mandatory minimum sentencing 
requirements of the First Step Act, an impor-
tant, bipartisan criminal justice reform measure 
passed by Congress and signed into law in 
2018. 
In a 9–3 opinion, the Seventh Circuit held 
that at the time of the enactment of the First 
Step Act, Hector Uriarte, a federal defendant, 
was convicted but not yet sentenced, and 
therefore eligible for the First Step Act’s re-
duced sentencing procedure. 
Mr. Uriarte was resentenced under the First 
Step Act to a term of 20 years, and the Trump 
administration challenged that new sentence, 
and predictably Judge Barrett authored the 
dissent, siding with the Trump administration 
that the First Step Act did not apply to the de-
fendant. 
In another case, McCottrell v. White, 933 
F.3d 651 (7th Cir. 2019), the majority reversed 
the district judge’s finding that the guards had 
fired ‘‘reasonable’’ warning shots and re-
manded the case but Judge Barrett dissented, 
siding with prison guards who fired buckshot 
from their shotguns, significantly injuring two 
inmates, and opining that the inmates should 
be denied the opportunity to prove at trial that 
excessive force was used against them in vio-
lation of the Eighth Amendment. 
Judge Barrett’s reasoning was so unreason-
able that the majority was moved to note that 
‘‘the dissent suggests that firing two shotguns 
loaded with buckshot into the ceiling of a 
crowded dining hall cannot be deemed to be 
malicious and sadistic or even characterized 
as an intentional application of force without a 
showing that a guard ‘intended to hit or harm 
someone with his application of force.’ That 
standard is met here.’’ 
The scourge of gun violence kills nearly 
40,000 Americans every year but Judge 
Barrett’s record indicates she would likely be 
a pivotal vote on the Court to support the gun 
lobby and strike down common-sense gun 
safety laws. 
In Kanter v. Barr, 919 F.3d 437 (7th Cir. 
2019), a Seventh Circuit panel majority con-
sisting of Reagan held that a law barring fel-
ons from possessing a firearm did not violate 
the Second Amendment but unsurprisingly 
Judge Barrett dissented, accusing the majority 
of treating the Second Amendment as a ‘‘sec-
ond-class right’’ and stating that she believed 
the ban on gun possession should only apply 
to violent felons. 
And outrageously, Judge Barrett also con-
cluded that it was appropriate to deny non-
violent felons the right to vote but not the right 
to bear arm, writing ‘‘history does show that 
felons could be disqualified from exercising 
certain rights—like the rights to vote and serve 
on juries—because these rights belonged only 
to virtuous citizens.’’ 
We do not need a Supreme Court Justice 
whose world view is that the right to own an 
AR–15 is more precious and valued than the 
fundamental right to vote. 
Upon Judge Barrett’s nomination to the Su-
preme Court, the Giffords Law Center stated: 
Judge Barrett holds Second Amendment 
views that are far more extreme than con-
servatives like Justice Antonin Scalia. Her 
willingness to disregard established prece-
dent and strike down gun safety laws is too 
radical for this country and even past Repub-
lican administrations. 
Moreover, it is clear that based on her state-
ments and judicial record, Judge Barrett is in-
capable of serving as a fair and neutral arbiter 
in reproductive rights cases, including those 
involving abortion, contraception, and perhaps 
even fertility care. 
In 2006, Judge Barrett signed her name to 
a two-page advertisement in a South Bend, In-
diana newspaper calling for the end of the 
legal right to abortion—which, under her ex-
tremist views, includes some forms of birth 
control and in vitro fertilization but she failed to 
disclose this document in her Senate Judiciary 
Committee questionnaire. 
In 2012, Judge Barrett signed a letter enti-
tled ‘‘Unacceptable’’ that protested the Obama 
administration’s good faith effort to create a 
compromise in carrying out the ACA’s require-
ment ensuring comprehensive birth control 
coverage, an accommodation permitted eligi-
ble employers and schools to opt out of cov-
ering birth control but still ensure that the 
workers and students had access to seamless 
coverage of essential care. 
As a signatory to this letter, Judge Barrett 
demonstrated that she is willing to eschew 
science in favor of her own personal biases 
and thinks employers can deny their workers 
birth control coverage. 
And unsurprisingly, Judge Barrett’s judicial 
record reflects her deep hostility to reproduc-
tive freedom.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E972 
October 20, 2020 
Cir. 2019), Judge Barrett voted to rehear a 
case involving an Indiana abortion restriction 
that judges already deemed likely unconstitu-
tional. 
The Indiana law put minors in dangerous 
situations by requiring them to notify their par-
ents even if a judge already found the minor 
to be mature enough to make this decision 
without involving a parent, which the district 
court noted that ‘‘the requirement of providing 
parental notification before obtaining an abor-
tion carries with it the threat of domestic 
abuse, intimidation, coercion, and actual phys-
ical obstruction.’’ 
The Indiana law was in clear violation of 
longstanding Supreme Court precedent, and 
the three-judge Seventh Circuit panel that 
blocked the Indiana law found that it would 
likely impose ‘‘an undue burden for the 
unemancipated minors who seek to obtain an 
abortion without parental involvement via the 
judicial bypass.’’ 
Yet Judge Barrett joined a dissent that 
questioned whether the plaintiffs could even 
challenge the law before it went into effect, ar-
guing erroneously that the status of pre-en-
forcement challenges in the abortion context’’ 
was ‘‘unsettled’’ and deserved full court re-
view. 
In another case, Planned Parenthood of In-
diana & Kentucky v. Commissioner of Indiana 
State Department of Health, 917 F.3d 532 (7th 
Cir. 2018), Judge Barrett voted in dissent to 
rehear a case already deemed unconstitu-
tional and joined a dissent that argued that a 
state should be able to restrict abortion when 
the reason for that choice is the fetus’s gen-
der, race, sex, or fetal diagnosis (often known 
as ‘‘reason bans’’), even though that provision 
was not being considered in the decision be-
fore the court. 
President Trump has bragged repeatedly 
that he would only nominate justices who 
would ‘‘automatically’’ overturn Roe v. Wade, 
410 U.S. 113 (1973); it is clear that Judge 
Barrett has passed his litmus test. 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a fearless 
champion of justice and the conscience of the 
Court so it is doubly outrageous that the Sen-
ate majority is attempting to rush through 
Judge Barrett’s nomination rather than ad-
dressing the many urgent challenges that are 
gripping our nation at this moment—from the 
devastating impact of the worst public health 
crisis in a hundred years, to the racial reck-
oning over police brutality and violence, to the 
need to safeguard our democracy by helping 
fund the election and U.S. Postal Service. 
At a time when more than 215,000 Ameri-
cans have lost their lives to COVID–19 and 
the need for health care access is more acute 
than ever, this President and this temporary 
Republican Senate majority has chosen to 
subordinate passing legislation to aid an ailing 
nation to stealing and filling a Supreme Court 
vacancy with a nominee hostile to health care 
access, hostile to women’s rights, and indif-
ferent to the plea for equal justice being 
voiced across the country by Americans of 
every race, creed, color, religion, and region. 
Madam Speaker, I end where I began: 
Judge Barrett’s extreme record on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, along 
with her ideologically driven writings and 
speeches, demonstrate that she is incapable 
of rendering equal justice under law. 
I urge this nomination be defeated and that 
this vacancy not be filled until after the elec-
tion of the next President of the United States. 
RECOGNIZING OSCARIN ORTEGA 
AS CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Oscarin Ortega, 
Founder and Executive Director of Lived Ex-
periences, a local youth outreach program, for 
my October Constituent of the Month. Born 
and raised in Oceanside, Oscarin launched 
Lived Experiences in 2018 to provide critical 
support and resources for underserved kids 
and teenagers in my District. 
After studying the effects of early childhood 
trauma and understanding the hardships on a 
deeply personal level himself, Oscarin wanted 
to ensure others could be set on a life path of 
success by providing the proper resources 
and guidance to help them flourish. Through 
training and mentoring, Oscarin educated him-
self on various restorative and therapeutic 
practices that could help him and others over-
come the damages of their past. With pro-
grams dedicated to healing and hope, Lived 
Experiences prides themselves on encour-
aging their amazing kids to embrace their 
brightest futures. 
Oscarin has also stepped up to support 
local youth during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
which has exacerbated food insecurity, do-
mestic abuse, and financial hardships. Seeing 
these strains particularly heightened among 
his youth and staff, Oscarin and Lived Experi-
ence set up food drives, school supply dona-
tions, fresh haircuts, community events, and 
much more to help alleviate the challenges of 
these unprecedented times. With the support 
of the community, the Lived Experiences team 
has so far distributed a total of 270,413 
pounds of food to working families in Ocean-
side. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region and our 
country a stronger place for everyone to live 
and thrive. Today, I am proud to recognize Mr. 
Ortega as my Constituent of the Month, and I 
thank him and his team at Lived Experiences 
for being incredible role models and positive 
examples for the youth in our community. I am 
honored to represent such an outstanding 
leader in my district.

SPINA BIFIDA AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to address 
the House for one minute, and to revise and 
extend my remarks. 
I rise today in honor of National Spina Bifida 
Awareness Month to pay tribute to the numer-
ous individuals and their families across our 
country living with this condition. 
Spina Bifida is a condition I am very familiar 
with. My sister and my niece both suffer from 
spina bifida. I know how it can impact a family. 
Spina Bifida is the nation’s most common 
permanently disabling birth defect compatible 
with life. Because Spina Bifida stems from a 
hole in the spinal cord, a condition known as 
a neural tube defect, as the spinal column fails 
to close properly during development in the 
womb, it impacts virtually every major organ 
system. Children born with Spina Bifida typi-
cally undergo dozens of surgeries before they 
become adults. Adults living with Spina Bifida 
face myriad physical health, mental health, 
and other challenges, such as unemployment 
and limited access to quality primary and spe-
cialty care. 
There are currently an estimated 166,000 
individuals in the United States living with 
Spina Bifida, approximately 65 percent of 
whom are adults. This disease is now wit-
nessing its first generation of adults, an in-
credible milestone, considering that the origi-
nal designation of Spina Bifida as a childhood 
condition meant that the vast majority did not 
experience life beyond youth. 
We have taken tremendous steps forward in 
recent years due to dedicated medical re-
search, but there is so much we still don’t 
know. 
Unfortunately, funding for Spina Bifida is 
limited. The only place in the federal govern-
ment that is specifically studying this complex 
condition for children and adults is the Spina 
Bifida Program at the National Center on Birth 
Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the 
CDC through the National Spina Bifida Patient 
Registry and the Spina Bifida Collaborative 
Care Network 
People with Spina Bifida deserve no less 
than the rest of us as we age. We must en-
sure that adults with Spina Bifida can receive 
high-quality medical care, and that research-
ers have the funds necessary to continue the 
development of treatments for spina bifida.

CELEBRATING THE WATER 
FORUMS 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and celebrate the 20th Anniversary 
of the Sacramento Area Water Forum. I com-
mend the Water Forum’s work on the Lower 
American River and for forging lasting partner-
ships with diverse organizations, including the 
US Bureau of Reclamation. The Water Forum 
and the Bureau of Reclamation have been 
strong collaborators on multiple habitat en-
hancement projects and on implementing the 
Modified Flow Management Standard. 
With negotiations starting in 1993, the 
Forum has come a long way to provide cohe-
sion in responsibly handling the water supplies 
and care of the Lower American River. Al-
though the agreement was signed on April 24, 
2000, today we celebrate this milestone of 20 
years virtually as a community. 
I want to thank the Water Forum members 
for the progress towards providing a safe and 
reliable water supply and the preservation of 
the fishery, wildlife and recreational values of 
the lower American River. I stand with the 
Water Forum today celebrating the opportunity 
to serve the Sacramento region in the future 
as we address climate change in our own 
community and across the nation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
JOSEPH HEBERT, SR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a community leader and 
friend, John Joseph Hebert, Sr. of Liberty, 
Texas, who passed away on Monday, October 
12, 2020, at the age of 82. John was a friend 
of many, myself included, and was a pillar of 
the community in Liberty. 
John was born on January 15, 1938, in 
Houston, Texas, to parents Horace Hebert 
and Marguerite Egan Hebert. He grew up in 
the Heights and attended St. Thomas High 
School. After a short stint as a salesman, 
John worked at a Gulf service station and 
made assistant manager before he was draft-
ed into the Army at age 23. After completing 
Basic Training in Colorado, he went on to 
serve in the Army in Anchorage, Alaska. 
John was a loving and devoted grandfather, 
father, husband, brother, and friend. On June 
29, 1957, John married the love of his life, the 
late Constance Catherine ‘‘Connie’’ Hebert. 
They went on to have many adventures and 
raise three children together. John and Connie 
were devoted Christians and lifetime members 
of the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church 
in Liberty, Texas. 
In 1972, John and Connie moved to Liberty, 
where he established his own company, John 
J. Hebert Distribution. He worked in petroleum 
marketing for over 60 years, and was awarded 
numerous sales achievements and national 
customer service awards. He was a humble 
man who didn’t like to speak of his accom-
plishments, though there were many—includ-
ing, but not limited to: 
Former President of the Liberty Dayton Area 
Chamber, Liberty Dayton Chamber Citizen of 
the Year in 1983, East Texas Man of the Year 
in 1989, Masonic Lodge Community Builder 
Award, Volunteer of the Year for the Texas 
Council of Child Welfare, Liberty Rotary Club 
Community Service Award in 1980, Member of 
Liberty Lions Club since 1972, Lion of the 
Year in 1980, Past President Liberty Lions

HGAC Aerco Board, Liberty County CPS 
Treasurer, Bridgehaven Children’s Advocacy 
Center Board of Directors, and Friends of

John was preceded in death by his parents; 
his beloved wife of 57 years, Connie Hebert; 
sister Rosemary McKeon; brother, Horace Wil-
liam ‘‘Bill’’ Hebert; and sister Primrose Kitchen. 
He is survived by his loving daughter, Donna 
Catherine Ramirez and husband Danny; son, 
John Hebert, Jr. and wife, Amy; son, Stephen 
Hebert and wife, Julie; grandsons, Josh Burk 
and wife, Kristin, Jeremy Burk, Daniel Hebert,

Chandler Sanders and Preston Yawn. In addi-
tion, he leaves behind numerous other loving 
family members and friends. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my 
friend John Hebert, Sr. for his many years of 
faithful service to our community. My thoughts 
and prayers remain with his family and friends 
during this difficult time.

CORRECTION OF H.R. 5823 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, an error occurred when the House 
passed H.R. 5823, the ‘‘State and Local Cy-
bersecurity Improvement Act,’’ as amended on 
September 30, 2020. The text of the bill that 
passed the House failed to represent an 
amendment offered by the gentlelady from 
Michigan, Congresswoman SLOTKIN, that was 
adopted on a bipartisan basis by the Full 
Committee on Homeland Security on February 
12, 2020. The amendment, which was agreed 
to by unanimous consent, allowed for cooper-
ative programs developed by groups of local 
governments and for State programs to sup-
port local governments and critical infrastruc-
ture owners and operators in addressing cy-
bersecurity risks and threats to be included in 
the state’s cybersecurity plan and thus be eli-
gible for grant funding. At this juncture, with 
the measure pending with the Senate, I stand 
committed to restoring the erroneously omitted 
language in any House-Senate negotiations. 
Furthermore, should the 116th Congress close 
without the bill being enacted into law, I am 
committed to bringing the bill to the floor again 
in the next Congress with this important lan-
guage. I want to commend my colleague for 
her contributions to the bill and to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security. I have included 
the text of the amendment as approved by the 
Committee. 
OFFERED BY MS. SLOTKIN OF MICHIGAN 
Page 6, beginning line 10, insert the fol-
lowing: 
(2) DISCRETIONARY ELEMENTS.—The Cyber-
security Plan of a State described in para-
graph (1) may include— 
(A) cooperative programs developed by 
groups of local, Tribal, and territorial gov-
ernments within such State to address cy-
bersecurity risks and cybersecurity threats; 
and 
(B) programs provided by such State to 
support local, Tribal, and territorial govern-
ments and critical infrastructure owners and 
operators to address cybersecurity risks and 
cybersecurity threats.

HONORING THE LIFE OF COMMIS-
SIONER DAISY WILLIAMS LYNUM 
HON. VAL BUTLER DEMINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 20, 2020 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and legacy of Com-
missioner 
Daisy 
Williams 
Lynum, 
who 
transitioned from labor to reward on Thursday, 
October 8, 2020. 
Born in Leesburg, Florida, Commissioner 
Lynum was a proud graduate of Bethune 
Cookman University and chose to dedicate 
her life to public service at an early age. Daisy 
Lynum clearly understood that education was 
the greatest key to success, so she began her 
career as a teacher. Her commitment to serv-
ice was just beginning when she became a 
social worker with the Florida Department of 
Health and Rehabilitative Services. Her work 
as a social worker further demonstrated her 
commitment to improving the quality of life for 
all people, not just the privileged few. 
In 1998, Daisy Lynum was called to even 
greater work when she was elected to the Or-
lando City Council, succeeding Commissioner 
Nap Ford. Commissioner Lynum was the right 
person at the right time. She was a tenacious, 
no-nonsense leader, who fought for edu-
cational and economic opportunities for citi-
zens and business owners in her district. 
She was responsible for the introduction of 
initiatives, like the Blueprint Program, to en-
sure the largest public work projects had a di-
rect benefit to the community, women and 
other minority-owned businesses. In addition, 
Commissioner Lynum was instrumental in 
bringing the Florida A&M University College of 
Law to District 5. 
Commissioner Lynum served 16 years, and 
I was honored to serve during a portion of that 
time as police chief. As such, I enjoyed work-
ing alongside Commissioner Lynum during 
good and challenging times in Orlando. I will 
forever cherish our numerous meetings, pri-
vate conversations, laughs, strategy sessions, 
and debates. She was a master debater. 
Commissioner Lynum was my Sister in Delta 
and my friend. I learned much from her wis-
dom and leadership. 
Madam Speaker, Commissioner Lynum was 
a true public servant who fought to make Dis-
trict 5 one of the greatest communities to live, 
work, and visit. She loved her community and 
the community loved her. We are forever 
grateful for a life well lived.
