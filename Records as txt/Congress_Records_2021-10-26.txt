f 
SLOUCHING TOWARD A WELFARE 
STATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, it is so-
bering 
to 
know 
that 
American 
exceptionalism is only a few degrees 
away from extinction. It should never 
be that way. 
One of the greatest threats we face as 
a Nation is the creation of a welfare 
state and, subsequently, the mentality 
that is bred by one. 
It seems that many have forgotten 
the simple principle that Americans 
have always abided by: Here, we work 
to earn our keep. Over the course of 
the last 9 months, that principle has 
become lost. 
It is evident that America is no 
longer slouching toward socialism; we 
are standing on its doorstep. We are 
much better than this as a country. 
The welfare-without-work expansions 
that are being proposed by the major-
ity are dangerous. One of those expan-
sions is the child tax credit that bears 
no work requirements for recipients. 
Twenty-five years ago, Republicans 
and Democrats came together to re-
form America’s welfare system. It was 
a 
bipartisan 
effort 
through 
and 
through. But if you fast-forward to 
today, the majority has ignored the 
spirit of that agreement in favor of 
their own distorted agenda. 
Simply put, the majority has turned 
the child tax credit into a cash-for-kids 
handout. Remember, the recipients of 
this handout are not required to work 
to receive it. 
Just last week, President Biden ad-
mitted during a CNN townhall that he 
opposes a work requirement. Keep in 
mind that members of the President’s 
own party, such as Senator MANCHIN, 
are advocating for a work requirement. 
The University of Chicago recently 
published a study showing how expand-
ing the child tax credit disincentivizes 
work. In fact, it would lead to an exo-
dus of 1.5 million workers from the 
workforce. America simply can’t afford 
that. 
When you consider the loss of 1.5 mil-
lion workers and the abysmal jobs re-
ports that have come out this year, it 
is clear that something is wrong. The 
labor force participation rate plum-
meted last month to 61.6 percent. The 
last time the labor force participation 
rate was 61.6 percent was in April of 
1976. 
There are roughly 3 months left in 
2021, and at this pace America is on 
track to fall right off the cliff and onto 
the rocks below. That is the cost of 
government dependency. That is the 
cost of providing a steady stream of 
other taxpayer checks that pay more 
to sit at home than to work. 
Pitting 
Main 
Street 
businesses 
against government-led benefits won’t 
build the economy back. It won’t get 
Americans back to work, and it cer-
tainly won’t steer our great country to 
brighter and better days. 
American exceptionalism is not built 
by welfare or sitting at home col-
lecting a check. It is built by everyday 
people who show up at work and get 
the job done. If that fundamental prin-
ciple is lost, then America will be lost 
as well. 
There is no denying that America is 
standing on socialism’s doorstep. Look 
at the state our country is in because 
of the majority’s failed policies and 
what could come down the line. 
Government dependency robs this 
great country and its citizens of unpar-
alleled opportunity. The majority has 
steered us in that direction, and the 
American people should be downright 
fearful.

AMERICA’S 
FAILING 
WATER 
IN-
FRASTRUCTURE 
MUST 
BE 
RE-
PLACED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
O’HALLERAN). The Chair recognizes the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, we can’t 
build back better without replacing 
every inch of lead service line in our 
country. 
In too many of our communities from 
Flint to Benton Harbor to the cities of 
Wayne and Hamtramck and across the 
State of Michigan and our Nation, the 
water is poisoned with lead. 
We have an opportunity now to 
change it, with a bold and clear invest-
ment to replace every single lead-con-
taminated service line in our Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5876 
October 26, 2021 
Experts have already estimated that 
we need $60 billion to replace every 
service lead pipeline in America. But 
we know the Senate proposal—which 
was negotiated without a shred of 
input from frontline communities or 
their representatives—only devotes $15 
billion. That is just simply not enough. 
People are drinking water with lead 
now, and we know which communities 
lose out when there isn’t enough 
money to go around. They are commu-
nities that look like mine. It is envi-
ronmental justice neighborhoods. 
We must—we must—do more, and we 
already have secured another $30 bil-
lion in Build Back Better to get us 
closer to our goal. Again, a clear way 
to bring us all together is making sure 
that we all have access to clean water. 
There are 2.65 million service lines in 
Michigan, and over 12 percent of those 
lines are contaminated with lead. To 
replace these lead pipes in Michigan 
alone, it would cost $1.65 billion. 
Again, I ask everyone, how can we 
build back better when children are 
being poisoned? 
Benton Harbor in Michigan needs 
$11.4 million to provide clean water to 
its residents. We just discovered new 
lead-contaminated issues in the cities 
of Wayne and Hamtramck in Michigan. 
That is why it is critical that the Fed-
eral 
Government, 
our 
government, 
steps up with bold and aggressive in-
vestment. 
In 2018 a report from the Natural Re-
sources Defense Council revealed that 
between 2015 and 2018 about 5.5 million 
Americans in communities around the 
Nation got their water from a system 
that exceeded the EPA’s lead action 
level of 15 parts per billion. That is just 
the stuff we know about. We know that 
there is more. 
The 
threat 
of 
lead-contaminated 
water is a longstanding one that has 
overwhelmingly impacted communities 
like mine, low-income communities, 
communities of color, for decades. And 
yet we have not done anything mean-
ingful for a very long time to really, 
truly remove lead service lines. 
We continue waking up to stories 
about children being poisoned with 
lead and cities handing out bottled 
water because we have failed to invest 
in our water infrastructure. Folks are 
being forced to drink, bathe, cook, and 
wash dishes with water that is literally 
contaminated with lead because politi-
cians have put their well-being on the 
back burner. 
On top of it all, the leaky, outdated 
infrastructure also means many of 
those same people can’t even afford to 
pay for water that is being poisoned. 
Literally, they are paying money for 
water that is contaminated with lead. 
Some people in Washington like to pre-
tend to worry about how we are going 
to pay for lead pipe replacement, but 
what we really can’t afford is another 
moment of inaction. 
Clean, affordable drinking water is a 
human right. There are Flints and Ben-
ton Harbors and cities of Wayne and 
Hamtramck in every part of this coun-
try, communities right now where chil-
dren are drinking water that can alter 
the course of their lives forever. 
So please join me in replacing lead 
service lines across the country. It is a 
moral imperative. We need to imme-
diately pass the full $45 billion in the 
Senate proposal as well as the Build 
Back Better proposal. Again, there is 
no building back without it.

CONGRATULATING BROOKE 
CHILDERS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate my dis-
trict director, Brooke Childers, for 
being named a member of the Georgia 
Southern University Alumni Associa-
tion’s ‘‘40 under 40’’ class of 2021. 
Brooke 
graduated 
from 
Georgia 
Southern University in 2005 with a de-
gree in political science. Since grad-
uating, Brooke has served her commu-
nity with immense passion and dedica-
tion. As our district director, Brooke 
has ensured that the highest levels of 
constituent outreach and services are 
met throughout the district. 
From cofounding a southeastern Ro-
tary E-Club to volunteering across 
Georgia’s First District, Brooke con-
tinues to make a lasting impact. 
Whatever role Brooke has occupied, 
she has exemplified compassion, deter-
mination, and leadership. A model pub-
lic servant, Brooke is well deserving of 
this prestigious honor. 
I am proud to have her on our team, 
and I am thankful for all that she does 
for the First District and the entire 
State of Georgia. I am forever grateful 
to have her lead our district office and 
represent us in our community. 
OCTOBER IS AMERICAN PHARMACISTS MONTH 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize October as 
American Pharmacists Month. 
As a pharmacist, I have seen first-
hand the impact pharmacists have on 
people’s lives. Throughout this pan-
demic, pharmacists have helped dis-
tribute lifesaving medicines and care 
to those in need. 
Pharmacists across our country de-
serve to be recognized for their service 
in helping others through these unprec-
edented times. Every day these phar-
macists are providing vaccines for a 
number of illnesses and carefully coun-
seling patients on prescriptions. 
As a pharmacist currently serving in 
Congress, I am proud to recognize the 
work these individuals are doing every 
day to serve their local communities 
around the country. Their commitment 
to serving their communities is to be 
admired by all. 
Mr. Speaker, this month, as well as 
through the rest of the year, I encour-
age everyone to visit their pharmacist, 
ask questions about your prescriptions, 
and get to know the people who provide 
your medicine and work to keep you 
healthy. 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF TONY COPE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor Tony Cope of Sa-
vannah, Georgia, who sadly passed 
away on October 8 at the age of 83. 
Founder and director of the Oatland 
Island Wildlife Center, Tony dedicated 
his life to teaching and inspiring the 
next generation. 
After attending college, Tony re-
turned to Savannah, where he would 
serve the community for over 30 years 
as an author, educator, baseball coach, 
and an administrator. 
Beyond the classroom, Tony’s life 
work was sharing his love of Savannah 
with others. Authoring many books 
about his beloved hometown, Tony’s 
work touched countless lives. 
As president of the Savannah Sym-
phony and member of the Rotary Club 
East, Tony’s passion for his commu-
nity was undeniable. 
Despite retiring to Ireland, Tony was 
always first and foremost a Savannah 
native. 
I am grateful for Tony’s service to 
Georgia’s First Congressional District, 
and I know his legacy will never be for-
gotten. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
AWARD-WINNING SAVANNAH/HILTON HEAD 
INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Savan-
nah/Hilton Head International Airport 
for being awarded the number one air-
port in the country by 2021 Conde Nast 
Traveler Readers’ Choice Awards. 
More than 800,000 readers rated the 
Savannah airport as the number one 
destination that they cannot wait to 
return to. 
Since opening their doors in 1929, the 
Savannah airport has helped shape the 
Savannah community into a world-re-
nowned travel destination. 
This distinguished award highlights 
the airport’s exemplary customer serv-
ice and dedication to safety and secu-
rity. 
Providing the Savannah community 
with countless jobs and tremendous 
service, Savannah’s airport has con-
tributed immensely to the economic 
success of Georgia’s First Congres-
sional District. 
Much like the readers of Conde Nast 
Traveler, I believe the southern charm 
of Savannah’s airport makes it a truly 
unforgettable experience. 
I look forward to the continued suc-
cess 
of 
the 
Savannah/Hilton 
Head 
International Airport.

DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
TLAIB). The Chair recognizes the gen-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5877 
October 26, 2021 
As a former law enforcement officer, 
some of the very first calls I responded 
to involved domestic violence. During 
my years as a young officer, I saw first-
hand the damage this uniquely heinous 
crime can do to survivors and their 
families. As a homicide investigator 
later, I saw it on a continual basis 
through the court system and the dev-
astation that it means to families 
across America. 
This is an issue close to my heart and 
one I have focused my public policy ef-
forts on from day one of my public 
service. Beginning with my time as a 
member of the Arizona legislature, all 
the way to the Halls of Congress, I 
have advocated for survivors, their 
children, and the resources needed to 
get whole families into stable and safe 
situations. 
That is why, as a member of the Bi-
partisan Task Force to End Sexual Vi-
olence, I am proud to cosponsor a reso-
lution to recognize the month of Octo-
ber as Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month and to have championed legisla-
tion that uplifts survivors across Ari-
zona. 
Together, as a Congress, we must 
commit to working to do whatever is 
in our power to secure justice for sur-
vivors both in and out of the court-
room. 
This week I will reintroduce my Help 
End 
Abusive 
Living 
Situations 
or 
HEALS Act. 
b 1015 
My bill will assist survivors of do-
mestic violence to rapidly secure safe 
housing situations by directing the 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment to prioritize funds for transi-
tional housing, rapid rehousing, and 
permanent supportive housing for sur-
vivors of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
No person experiencing these crimes 
should be forced to stay in a dangerous 
situation because they do not have 
housing elsewhere. 
The horrible legacy of domestic vio-
lence affects communities across our 
Nation, including Tribal communities. 
As the Representative of Arizona’s 
First Congressional District, I am 
humbled to represent 12 Sovereign 
Tribal Nations. Federal data indicates 
that 55 percent of American Indian and 
Alaska Native women have experienced 
physical violence by an intimate part-
ner. 
However, it is estimated that less 
than 1 percent of the Crime Victims 
Fund reaches Tribes. 
This Congress, I reintroduced two of 
my bills that address domestic violence 
in Tribal communities. 
First, the SURVIVE Act, a bill to 
provide legal, medical, and counseling 
resources to women and children in 
Tribal communities who are survivors 
of domestic violence. This bill also cor-
rects the Crime Victims Fund’s alloca-
tion to Tribes, ensuring they receive a 
fair percentage of resources. 
Second, my Native Youth and Tribal 
Officer Protection Act, bipartisan leg-
islation that ensures children and law 
enforcement officials in Tribal commu-
nities are protected when present at 
domestic violence incidents. 
Currently, Tribes can convict non-In-
dian perpetrators of protection order 
violations, domestic violence, and dat-
ing violence. 
But under current law, both the chil-
dren of survivors and law enforcement 
officers who risk their lives to save vic-
tims are not protected by these same 
laws. My bill extends this Tribal juris-
diction to cover kids and cops, who so 
often deal with dangerous domestic sit-
uations. 
I am committed to continued work 
with my colleagues in Congress, advo-
cates on the ground in Arizona, and 
brave survivors. We hear you, and we 
believe you. 
To those experiencing domestic vio-
lence and to those who have lost a 
loved one to this heinous and deeply 
personal form of violence, let me say 
this: I know that we cannot ever truly 
know your pain, but we will keep fight-
ing for change at every level. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF LUKE 
SIEGEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the life of a re-
markable young man named Luke 
Siegel, who inspired so many with his 
strength of spirit and will to live in the 
face of tremendous adversity. 
On July 28 of 2015, Luke suffered se-
vere brain damage as a result of a trag-
ic golf cart accident that changed his 
life forever and left him immobile, life-
less, and even without the ability to 
speak. Doctors said, Madam Speaker, 
that he would stay in that condition as 
long as he lived. 
But, through the love and support of 
his family, the prayers of our wonder-
ful community, and the relentless and 
tenacious fight that Luke brought 
every day, he defied all odds and the di-
agnoses of numerous doctors, recov-
ering to a life no one believed was pos-
sible. 
Sadly, on August 19, our hero and 
west Texas warrior, Luke Siegel, went 
home to be with his Heavenly Father. 
Luke is survived by one amazing fam-
ily: father, Tim; mother, Jenny; and 
sisters Alex, Kate, and Ellie. 
Madam Speaker, Luke never gave up. 
He was a symbol of hope for people 
throughout the country whose families 
have struggled with the challenges of 
traumatic brain injury. Luke is an in-
spiration to us all to live every day to 
the fullest and never give up no matter 
what the circumstances. 
I am confident that Luke Siegel 
heard those beautiful and sweet words 
of our creator and Lord of heaven and 
Earth. 
Madam Speaker, Luke fought the 
good fight, he finished the race, and he 
kept the faith. May Luke enter into his 
eternal rest. God bless Luke Siegel, 
coach, your family, and God bless west 
Texas. 
RECOGNIZING NANCY LILES 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the accomplish-
ments of an outstanding lady, Nancy 
Liles, who recently retired after an il-
lustrious 36-year career as executive di-
rector of the Abilene Convention and 
Visitors Bureau. 
Ms. Liles’ passion for hospitality em-
bodies the spirit of west Texas and has 
made Abilene a thriving tourist des-
tination where visitors feel right at 
home. 
West Texas is known for its friendli-
ness and hospitality, and Ms. Liles has 
exemplified these attributes in her 
service to our community and the Key 
City. 
Abilene, Texas, is a warmer and more 
welcoming place because of the leader-
ship and service of Nancy Liles. We 
wish Nancy well as she spends more 
time with her family and continues to 
be a champion for the Big Country in 
Abilene, America. God bless, and go 
west Texas. 
RECOGNIZING MINDY PATTERSON 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize an outstanding west 
Texan, Ms. Mindy Patterson. 
Mindy has served the city of Abilene 
for three decades, from her start as an 
entry-level accountant to her current 
position of deputy city manager. 
This year marks her 30th year of 
service for the city of Abilene, and her 
colleagues know her as a servant leader 
and a tireless worker who will do any-
thing for her beloved community. 
The city manager, Robert Hanna, de-
scribes Ms. Patterson as somebody who 
is, ‘‘simply indispensable to my leader-
ship team.’’ 
I am grateful to Ms. Patterson for 
her service to Abilene and look forward 
to even more successes from her in the 
future and for our great city and com-
munity. 
God bless Ms. Patterson, who is keep-
ing the wheels turning out in west 
Texas. And go west Texas.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF GABRIELLA MILLER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. WEXTON) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the remarkable life and 
legacy 
of 
a 
young 
constituent, 
Gabriella Miller, who passed away on 
this day 8 years ago due to an inoper-
able brain tumor. 
Gabriella was a fierce fighter not just 
in her own battle with cancer, but as 
an advocate on behalf of the millions of 
other children who have suffered from 
this disease. In the months following 
her 
terminal 
diagnosis 
at 
age 
9, 
Gabriella became a national force for 
change, urging Congress to grant in-
creased funding and to develop better 
treatments and cures for childhood 
cancer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5878 
October 26, 2021 
Her passionate plea for lawmakers to 
‘‘stop talking, start doing’’ helped de-
liver a successful push to pass the 
Gabriella Miller Kids First Research 
Act, bipartisan legislation named in 
her honor. Gabriella’s family joined 
sponsor Representative Eric Cantor 
from Virginia and President Barack 
Obama in the Oval Office in 2014 for the 
bill signing. 
The Kids First program established a 
10-year Pediatric Research Initiative 
Fund and led to the creation of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health Kids First 
Pediatric and Data Resource Center. It 
has allocated millions of dollars to re-
search grants looking into pediatric 
cancer and rare diseases, supporting 
over 60 research projects. 
I am honored to carry on Gabriella’s 
mission by sponsoring the Gabriella 
Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0, 
which would deliver a new sustained 
and expanded funding source for this 
lifesaving program. 
It has been 8 years since we lost 
Gabriella, and there is still a long fight 
ahead to better understand, treat, and 
ultimately cure childhood cancer. The 
2.0 bill would give a dramatic boost to 
that fight and help demonstrate that 
Congress is serious about ensuring that 
no other family has to go through what 
the Miller family has. 
Madam Speaker, I share Gabriella’s 
story today so that her legacy con-
tinues to live on. May Congress have 
the courage to answer Gabriella’s call 
to ‘‘stop talking, start doing’’ and de-
liver the resources needed to treat and 
cure childhood cancer.

RECOGNIZING BELLE HALL 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in recognition of Belle Hall Ele-
mentary School in Mount Pleasant, 
South Carolina. They were recently 
awarded the National Blue Ribbon 
School designation by the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education. 
Belle Hall is one of 325 schools in the 
Nation, one of five in South Carolina, 
and the only one in South Carolina’s 
First Congressional District to earn 
this distinction. 
Led 
by 
their 
principal, 
Kevin 
Conklin, and the assistant principal, 
Bonita Foster, and numerous dedicated 
teachers, Belle Hall attributes their 
success to the tremendous level of sup-
port from their families, from busi-
nesses, and from the community as a 
whole in Mount Pleasant. 
I would like to recognize the PTA as 
well who has made significant strides 
in increasing student learning out-
comes for math and reading by raising 
more than $100,000 a year to supple-
ment one-on-one tutoring for their 
struggling students. 
As we all know, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has presented enormous chal-
lenges for our schools, teachers, and 
parents. Belle Hall has overcome these 
challenges and demonstrated excel-
lence despite them. 
RECOGNIZING BARBARA MELVIN’S NEW POSITION 
AND RECOGNIZING JIM NEWSOME’S RETIREMENT 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate 
Barbara Melvin on her new position as 
the new president and CEO of South 
Carolina Ports Authority. 
Barbara will be the sixth leader in 
the history of the port and the first 
woman to lead a top 10 U.S. operating 
container port. 
Barbara has been with the South 
Carolina Ports Authority for over 23 
years, and I am confident in her ability 
to lead our State and our region and 
our Nation. 
Today I also recognize our much be-
loved outgoing president and CEO, Jim 
Newsome. 
Jim has been the keystone in pro-
viding supply chain stability in our 
State and indeed our Nation and has 
developed visionary strategies for the 
port of South Carolina. 
For 13 years, Jim oversaw countless 
projects which extended the port’s 
reach and led to a doubling of con-
tainer volumes over the last decade. 
I applaud Jim Newsome for his serv-
ice and his incredible career on behalf 
of the First Congressional District. We 
thank him for his leadership, his pas-
sion, and his direction. 
HONORING CURTIS BOSTIC 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to an incred-
ible 
feat 
under 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances. South Carolina’s First 
Congressional 
District 
constituent, 
Curtis Bostic, was called to action to 
assist an endangered employee based in 
Afghanistan. Their communication was 
over 7,000 miles apart. 
Mr. Bostic and his aides at the Chris-
tian 
relief 
group 
from 
Charleston 
called Remember pulled off an evacu-
ation using intelligence reports from 
the streets of Kabul, Google maps, and 
a secure cell phone application to com-
municate with the employee and his 
family as they avoided all of the 
Taliban’s roadblocks. 
I am happy to report the employee 
that Mr. Bostic and Remember had 
been working to assist has arrived in 
the UAE safely along with his wife and 
three children who were all under the 
age of 10. 
I applaud Mr. Bostic and Remember 
for their perseverance as many said the 
evacuation would be abandoned and it 
would never happen. They continued 
fighting for their employee’s life and 
for the safety of his children and their 
family with ultimate success. 
RECOGNIZING TRUIST BANK AND TRIDENT 
TECHNICAL COLLEGE 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to thank Truist Bank and Tri-
dent Technical College for working to-
gether to create a new CDL training 
program this summer in north Charles-
ton. 
There is an acute need for truck driv-
ers right now, particularly given the 
supply chain shortages and the issues 
we are seeing across the country from 
COVID–19. 
This CDL program will enable stu-
dents to obtain their certificate in as 
short as 9 weeks. Trident Technical 
College will have day and evening ses-
sions for students, and these programs 
will start about every 3 weeks. I have 
heard there is already a wait list for 
the program, and I couldn’t be happier 
to hear it. 
I commend Truist Transportation 
and Logistics Center and Trident Tech-
nical College and Mary Thornely for 
their collaborative effort to fill a 
much-needed void and gap in our sup-
ply 
chains 
and 
for 
bringing 
the 
Lowcountry to the forefront of innova-
tion and problem solving in the private 
sector during COVID–19. 
BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
Ms. MACE. Madam Speaker, October 
is National Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month. In the U.S., one in eight women 
will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 
her lifetime. Almost every one of us 
knows someone who has been diag-
nosed with breast cancer. 
Sadly and tragically, it is the most 
common cancer among women world-
wide. 
On average, every 2 minutes a woman 
is diagnosed with breast cancer, and 
one woman will die of breast cancer 
every 13 minutes. 
Over three million breast cancer sur-
vivors are alive in the United States 
today. 
In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness 
Month, I also recognize South Carolina 
reporter from the Associated Press, 
Meg Kinnard, who had the courage to 
talk about being diagnosed with breast 
cancer earlier this year. Meg came 
home just a few days ago from her 
many treatments, and she is now free 
from breast cancer. It is a heart-
warming story, and I wish we had the 
research and the resources to ensure 
every woman who is diagnosed with 
breast cancer comes home cancer free.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

this violence in too many cases and 
are, themselves, victims. 
Our Native American and Latino 
communities are the most impacted. 
While Native people, especially Native 
women, have the highest need for med-
ical and legal services, the current law 
does not provide them with equitable 
funding or resources. 
This bill takes the steps to fix these 
inequities. It authorizes a Tribal do-
mestic violence hotline, discretionary 
resource centers on Alaska Native pop-
ulations, and direct funding for Tribal 
coalitions. 
These changes will provide much- 
needed help to our communities so that 
we may properly respond to their 
needs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Build Back Better agenda. I would note 
that it is a women’s agenda, Build 
Back Better. It is because we will be 
investing in those things that all 
women need to succeed in life because 
we began with our children. 
The Build Back Better bill would ex-
pand and continue the child tax credit, 
which began under the American Res-
cue Plan. We cannot tell those families 
who finally received the child tax cred-
it that the clock has struck midnight 
and they can no longer receive it. We 
must continue this tax credit so that 
all children in all families receive that 
benefit. 
The Build Back Better agenda also 
makes sure that we provide pre-K so 
that there is universal pre-K. We know 
the biggest benefit we can provide our 
children is ensuring that everybody has 
quality pre-K education. When doing 
so, we must ensure that we pay the 
teachers of our children what they de-
serve and give them the respect they 
need. 
In that sense, we will also be invest-
ing in our workforce development so 
that we can have the qualified workers 
who will be able to care for our chil-
dren, who will be able to teach our 
children. The workforce development 
and workforce innovation investments 
in this bill are very needed. 
I come from a State where we will 
need to transition away from oil and 
gas. In order to ensure a just transition 
for energy communities, we must en-
sure that there are new jobs for those 
workers. 
Build Back Better will allow the cre-
ation of new jobs, both for plugging 
abandoned wells and for addressing the 
legacy pollution that we have seen that 
needs to be cleaned up. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support the Build Back Bet-
ter agenda. It is good for our families. 
It is good for our women. It is good for 
our planet. 
RECOGNIZING THE TZEDEK 
ASSOCIATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today as a proud American. In 1776, our 
Founding Fathers proposed e pluribus 
unum, ‘‘Out of many, we are one,’’ for 
the first Great Seal of our country. It 
can be found on our currency, on build-
ings, and in the seal of the U.S. House 
of Representatives. 
Sadly, this fundamental value is 
rarely seen in today’s day and age. I 
am proud because I have come across 
an American faith-based organization 
that should serve as an example to all 
of us and this principle of e pluribus 
unum. 
I am referring to the Tzedek Associa-
tion. Recently, though they are of a 
completely different faith, and though 
this is really outside the purview of 
what they normally do, Tzedek has 
dedicated itself to saving the people 
from Afghanistan. 
The Tzedek Association is a Jewish 
national nonprofit that advocates for 
criminal justice reform and religious 
liberty and fights for humanitarian 
cases throughout the globe. 
Tzedek championed the First Step 
Act, as well as other commonsense 
criminal justice reforms. In fact, the 
president and founder of Tzedek, Rabbi 
Moshe Margaretten, was honored by 
former President Trump and the First 
Lady with the lighting of the menorah 
at the White House Hanukkah party in 
recognition of Tzedek’s contribution to 
prison reform. 
After the Taliban took over Kabul, it 
came to Tzedek’s attention that the 
last remaining Jew of Afghanistan was 
in danger of being killed. They were re-
quested to utilize their political con-
nections to save his life. One thing led 
to another, and this led to Tzedek co-
ordinating the escape of dozens and 
dozens of Afghans. 
Let me stress the novelty of this: An 
Orthodox Jewish organization, led by 
Orthodox rabbis, is working day and 
night to save the lives of Muslims, 
Christians, and people of other faiths— 
mostly many women and children—be-
cause they clearly live by the value 
‘‘out of many, we are one.’’ 
Tzedek has thus far coordinated the 
rescue of female judges, orphans, trans-
lators, 
and 
other 
individuals 
who 
helped the United States and the U.K. 
in the war on terror. They also saved 
the lives of female soccer players, who 
are at risk of being killed by the 
Taliban simply because they have cho-
sen to play this global sport. 
They recently led an effort to save 
two pregnant women who were high- 
risk targets, one of whom gave birth to 
a healthy baby girl just 3 days after 
being rescued. And yes, they also saved 
the last remaining Afghanistan Jew, 
Zebulun Simantov. 
But along with him, they rescued 30 
other people, religious minorities who 
were at risk of persecution just because 
of their faith. To accomplish all of this, 
Tzedek has raised hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars, all of which has come 
from the Jewish community. It is awe- 
inspiring and a lesson to us in Wash-
ington and to those all across the 
world that we must come together 
more often for the greater good. 
Despite our differences, we must 
unite as creations of an Almighty God 
and do what we can together to make 
this world a better place. 
RECOGNIZING TROOP 60 OF PAPILLION 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Boy Scout Troop 60 
of Papillion, Nebraska, for their efforts 
to partner with the city of Papillion to 
preserve the community’s historic 100- 
year-old Boy Scout cabin. 
Originally formed in 1913 as Troop 1, 
they began building the log cabin in 
1921 under the leadership of Scout-
master Reverend B. Johansen to be 
used as the troop’s headquarters. In 
June 1922, the Papillion community 
dedicated the Scout cabin, and it has 
been in continuous use ever since. 
The cabin is an iconic local landmark 
in Papillion’s City Park, celebrating 
pride in both Scouting and the commu-
nity. It is believed that this Scout 
cabin could be one of the oldest Scout 
cabins in continuous use west of the 
Mississippi. Troop 60 recently finished 
renovation of the historic cabin, pre-
serving it for another 100 years and for 
generations to come. 
This restoration was part of the Pa-
pillion 150 celebration. Papillion 150 
was a community movement that rec-
ognized the city of Papillion’s 150th an-
niversary, having grown from an 1870s 
railroad town that was on the mainline 
of the Union Pacific Railroad to now 
being one of the fastest growing cities 
in Nebraska. 
I also recognize the troop’s longtime 
sponsor, the Harry Bossard American 
Legion Post 32, which has mentored 
Troop 60 to be the shining example of 
positive impacts of Scouting. Through-
out Troop 60’s history, it is estimated 
that over 200 individuals have attained 
the rank of Eagle Scout, and many of 
those have gone on to become leaders 
throughout the community of Papil-
lion, the State of Nebraska, the mili-
tary, and even in the Halls of Congress 
with our own chief of staff, Mark 
Dreiling. 
Madam Speaker, I salute Troop 60 of 
Papillion.

BUILD BACK BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, Build Back Better. Three simple 
words, yet these words mean so much 
to my constituents and many Ameri-
cans across the country. 
Building back better means that 96 
percent of children in my district ben-
efit from a permanent and expanded 
child tax credit. Yes, you heard right: 
96 percent of the children in my dis-
trict.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5880 
October 26, 2021 
Recently, Secretary Yellen told us 
that the child tax credit has already 
reduced poverty in our country by 25 
percent, just with the first three 
checks. Imagine what continuation of 
this important program will do. 
This is huge for American families 
who are struggling to put food on the 
table, with Latino and Black families 
suffering the most. The child tax credit 
would help the parents of almost 8.8 
million children nationwide who are 
going hungry during this pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, now is the moment. 
It is time to do better for our children. 
The Build Back Better agenda will 
bring universal pre-K to our kids and 
end childcare deserts, an issue that af-
fects children and families in my dis-
trict and across America. Without pre- 
K or childcare, parents are forced to 
choose between their family or their 
job. 
In fact, just a few months ago, I vis-
ited a childcare facility that struggled 
to keep up with the demand due to the 
lack of childcare infrastructure in 
Houston. We need to invest in this crit-
ical infrastructure for children, for 
working parents, and for care workers. 
Madam Speaker, care workers are es-
sential. They care for our loved ones 
every day and keep this country run-
ning. We need to build back better with 
investments for our care workers so 
that their families can have better fu-
tures. We need to build back better for 
the almost one in two adults over 65 in 
Texas with multiple chronic medical 
conditions. 
Altogether, the Build Back Better 
agenda will make sure that millions of 
people in this country and in my home 
State 
of 
Texas 
gain 
affordable 
healthcare coverage. I represent a dis-
trict that struggles to get vital cov-
erage 
because 
the 
Republican-con-
trolled State government has refused 
to accept the Federal dollars to expand 
Medicaid. This is how we build back 
better for the people who need critical 
care. 
Families deserve that. They also de-
serve to unlock the American Dream 
through affordable housing so they can 
live with dignity. We need investments 
in first-generation home buyers and af-
fordable housing, housing vouchers, 
and more infrastructure so that fami-
lies can say ‘‘mi casa es su casa.’’ 
The Build Back Better agenda will do 
just that, but we must work hard. We 
must work hard to also provide a path-
way to citizenship for the hundreds and 
thousands of Dreamers, TPS holders, 
and essential workers. They have been 
contributing to our economy, keeping 
this country running, and making it 
prosper. 
The Build Back Better agenda will 
deliver on the American Dream prom-
ise and the values on which this Nation 
of immigrants was founded. It would 
fulfill the ‘‘give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses yearning to 
breathe free.’’ 
The Build Back Better agenda is an 
American agenda fulfilling this prom-
ise. The Build Back Better agenda is by 
and for the American people that will 
allow our country, our families, and 
our women to heal from this horrible 
pandemic and build back better with 
wealthy people and corporations pay-
ing their fair share. 
This is why we are here in Congress, 
fighting for the people, fighting for our 
children, and building a better future 
so our mothers can rejoin the work-
force, so our seniors can get care that 
will allow them to live with dignity, so 
our children can get the care they need 
without having to worry about poverty 
or going to school hungry, so our fami-
lies can say ‘‘mi casa es su casa’’ and 
live with dignity in their own homes. 
This is how we build back better for 
all. Our country doesn’t leave anyone 
behind, so this is how we honor the 
329.5 million Americans: building back 
better for everyone. This is how we 
honor every single one of them. 
Madam Speaker, our time is now. We 
must get this done. So let’s go and 
build back better now.

ASSAULT ON AMERICAN WAY OF 
LIFE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, we face an unprecedented as-
sault on the American way of life by 
the radical left. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, 
the left has weaponized the Federal 
Government to go after the American 
people. 
President Biden is building an IRS 
army of 85,000 new IRS agents to inves-
tigate middle-class Americans and ruin 
their lives. The Biden IRS wants the 
power to spy on private citizens’ bank 
accounts and monitor their trans-
actions. 
Biden’s Treasury Secretary said her 
next goal is to create a new tax on the 
value of farmland in America. This will 
destroy the American family farm and 
eliminate independent food production. 
The Biden-Harris administration is 
also weaponizing OSHA to fire Ameri-
cans who live paycheck to paycheck if 
they don’t make a healthcare decision 
about vaccines that leftwing politi-
cians don’t like. 
Madam Speaker, I note this hypoc-
risy from pro-abortion liberals who use 
the ‘‘my body my choice’’ slogan. We 
watched last week as Biden’s Attorney 
General tried to defend the use of the 
FBI agents who intimidated, harassed, 
and want to spy on parents who show 
up to school board meetings to speak 
in opposition to the Biden agenda. 
Middle-class parents are rightfully 
outraged that President Biden and left-
wing school boards want to turn their 
children against each other with racist 
curriculum or indoctrinate their young 
children with perverted sexual content. 
Americans used to be protected by 
the First Amendment. They were al-
lowed to speak freely in our society. 
Our Constitution and Bill of Rights 
limit the power of the Federal Govern-
ment because our Nation is a place 
where people should be free to start 
independent small businesses and raise 
their own children. 
b 1045 
The Biden administration and the 
radical left have a far different agenda. 
They want to use the FBI to intimidate 
and harass Americans; they want to 
use the IRS to spy on Americans; and 
they want to use OSHA to fire Ameri-
cans. 
The Federal Government is now a 
tool, a weapon that they want to use to 
make Americans obey. My constituents 
and the American people will not be in-
timidated by the Biden administration 
or the radical left, Madam Speaker. We 
are born free and our rights come from 
God. 
Our response to a weaponized Federal 
Government is loud and clear. In the 
spirit of freedom, we say: Let’s go, 
Brandon.

RECOGNIZING GRANT WOODS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. STANTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a fine Ar-
izona public servant who we unexpect-
edly lost just a few days ago: Grant 
Woods, our State’s former attorney 
general, someone who made a lasting 
impact on every person he met and on 
our State and on our Nation. 
Before he was an elected official in 
his own right, Grant was a staff mem-
ber right here in the people’s House. 
Then-Congressman John McCain chose 
Grant as his first chief of staff and 
they formed a friendship that lasted 
the rest of the great Senator’s life. 
They had a lot in common. They be-
lieved 
in 
bipartisanship 
and 
com-
promise, and they were both willing to 
ruffle a few feathers if they thought it 
was the right thing to do. And when it 
counted most, they lived by the most 
simple creed: country first. 
In the 1990s, as Arizona’s top law en-
forcement official, Grant earned a rep-
utation as a fighter for the little guy, 
and for good reason. He was one of the 
attorneys general who took on Big To-
bacco and won, earning the largest 
civil settlement in our Nation’s history 
on behalf of countless Arizonans who 
had been harmed. 
After he left elected office, he contin-
ued his crusades as one of the Nation’s 
top trial attorneys. He was a true Ren-
aissance man, a writer and a musician, 
and he was a passionate supporter of 
the arts and local artists. In fact, he is 
a member of the Arizona Music Hall of 
Fame. 
He was a tireless advocate for chil-
dren. In fact, there is a Boys & Girls 
Club in the East Valley named after 
Grant Woods. No one was a bigger fan 
of Arizona sports and sports teams 
than Grant Woods, and he was an occa-
sional critic of those teams when they 
deserved it.

SITUATION AT THE BORDER IS A 
COMPLETE AND TOTAL CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
GARCIA of Texas). The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. RUTH-
ERFORD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to speak against the am-
nesty provisions included in the Demo-
crat reconciliation bill. 
The situation at the border is a com-
plete and total crisis. Many folks look 
at what is happening there and they 
think it is incompetence by the Biden- 
Harris 
administration 
but, 
Madam 
Speaker, that is not true. Yes, there is 
a lot of incompetency in the Biden- 
Harris administration, but the south-
ern border is not a failed policy. It is 
the policy. 
The Democrats want illegal aliens to 
come to America as part of the social-
ist plan. In fact, the Democrat rec-
onciliation bill is a plan that would 
give amnesty to over 8 million illegal 
aliens—over 8 million. There is no pro-
vision to actually secure the southern 
border or to fix the problem at the 
source. 
This blanket amnesty for over 8 mil-
lion illegal aliens rewards law-break-
ers, empowers cartels, and encourages 
more people to make a very dangerous 
journey to our border. Amnesty for 
over 8 million illegal aliens is an out-
rageous proposal and must be defeated. 
CONGRATULATIONS TO FIGHT CRIME: INVEST IN 
KIDS 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate an organi-
zation, Fight Crime: Invest In Kids. It 
is a tremendous organization that 25 
years ago understood that if you are 
going to fight crime in a community 
you have to fight crime with what I 
used to call the entire PIE: prevention, 
intervention, and enforcement. 
And Fight Crime: Invest In Kids has 
been doing this for 25 years now, and I 
want to congratulate them on the un-
told number of young lives that they 
have saved and that they have kept out 
of a life of crime. 
Congratulations to Fight Crime: In-
vest In Kids. 
f 
THE NATIONAL ‘‘BIG UGLY’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. TENNEY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, for 
the past several months, my colleagues 
across the aisle have struggled to ad-
vance their budget reconciliation bill. 
The reason is simple: It is a disastrous 
piece of legislation that the American 
people simply don’t want now that 
they are starting to find out what is 
actually in it. 
When I served in Albany, we called 
these bloated budget bills, and ones 
just like this the ‘‘Big Ugly,’’ and ugly 
this is. 
I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
oppose our national ‘‘Big Ugly,’’ which 
will raise corporation taxes, and that 
includes small businesses and family 
farms, to 26.5 percent, one of the high-
est rates in the world, and higher than 
the Communist Party of China charges 
their corporations. 
Despite assurances from the adminis-
tration, low- and middle-income tax-
payers—and that includes, again, our 
small businesses and family farms, 
which are the heart of our commu-
nities which drive our economy—they 
will bear the brunt of this bill’s $2 tril-
lion-plus increase in taxes. 
Meanwhile, elite universities, left- 
leaning media outlets, and families 
earning more than $800,000 per year 
will receive major tax benefits or 
breaks. This bill also allocates billions 
of dollars to Green New Deal policies 
while raising taxes on America’s do-
mestic energy producers. 
As we approach winter in upstate 
New York—and it is cold, trust me—my 
constituents are facing some of the 
highest heating costs in recent mem-
ory. This bill’s tax hikes on American 
energy producers are an insult to New 
York families who will be left strug-
gling to pay their energy bills, espe-
cially those who are seniors on fixed 
incomes. 
The point is simple: The Build Back 
Better plan is an endless list of pro-
gressive priorities that will add tril-
lions of dollars to our national debt 
and 
worsen 
skyrocketing 
inflation, 
which is nothing more than a tax on 
the people who can least afford it: peo-
ple on fixed incomes, people struggling 
to make a living. 
Dictators from Russia to China, 
Putin to Xi, are counting on us to sup-
port our national ‘‘Big Ugly,’’ the 
Democrats’ Build Back Better plan, the 
budget reconciliation plan, that will 
secure Putin and Xi’s economic and en-
ergy dominance for decades to come. 
This will irreparably hurt Americans 
across the board. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this. Come up with a better plan that 
actually 
empowers 
American 
busi-
nesses, and especially the small busi-
nesses who create most of the jobs and 
drive our economy, and again, our fam-
ily farms which are the tradition and 
heart of our communities, especially in 
upstate New York.

INFLATION CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I was 
in a grocery store on Sunday and near-
ly a dozen of my constituents stopped 
me and were very upset about product 
shortages and price increases. 
According to the data, eggs are up 12 
percent, bacon is up 20 percent, chicken 
is up 8 percent, gasoline is up 40 to 50 
percent, hamburger and beef are run-
ning short. I can assure you, Madam 
Speaker, while these data points paint 
a picture, price increases are just sim-
ply much higher, and my constituents 
are feeling the effects in their family 
budgets. 
An older gentleman with a half-full 
shopping cart that rang up for $111 
glanced up at me and said: This is ri-
diculous. There are people filling their 
gas tanks now—before it was $50, now 
it is $80, $90, $100 to fill up a pickup 
truck because, Madam Speaker, the 
President and Members of this House— 
in fact, the leadership of this House— 
has decided to attack domestic energy 
production, which is clearly driving 
prices up through the roof. 
With winter around the corner, it 
will cost 30 percent more to heat an av-
erage person’s home. Yet, the Demo-
crats are trying to implement a home 
heating tax—that is a wonderful idea— 
in the so-called Build Back Better bill 
that will drive energy bills even higher. 
Madam Speaker, how is this helpful? 
How is it helpful to raise costs to tax 
our domestic energy while making it 
more competitive for Russia and Saudi 
Arabia and all the other places in the 
world to sell us their energy, so-called 
cheaper, when meanwhile a barrel of 
oil is over $80 a barrel. It makes no 
sense. 
And the thing is this, the American 
people get this. The American people 
know it. They are paying the price for 
it. Members here will pay the price at 
the polls because this bill called Build 
Back Better is a disaster, Madam 
Speaker. 
This is seventh grade economics. 
There is too much demand created by 
Big 
Government 
policies 
and 
not 
enough supply, not enough workers be-
cause we are providing far too much in-
centive for them not to work. Why 
would they, if they are making more 
not working? We are not doing any-
thing to help our U.S. productivity to 
fulfill the demand that is being created 
by these Big Government policies. 
All the while, foreign imports are 
pouring in and creating a bottleneck at 
our ports that we all see because we 
don’t have the capacity, number one, 
to build in the USA to fulfill the de-
mand; but number two, to unload the 
cargo ships and distribute the goods 
and then put them in trucks and ship 
them around the country. 
So even the Treasury Secretary is 
warning Americans that inflation will 
be here throughout the next year, even 
though the President and others have 
said: Oh, no, this is just a passing prob-
lem. Nobody has to worry about it. 
So what is the plan moving forward 
for the majority in this House, for the 
Democrats? They want to prime the de-
mand side of the equation with a 
multi-trillion 
dollar 
spending

October 26, 2021 
known as Build Back Better, and we 
are hearing all these wonderful things 
about it. 
Well, the problem is that all those 
wonderful things cost far too much and 
are completely unaffordable and aren’t 
being paid for by the Members of this 
House; they are being paid for by my 
constituents who are going to be worse 
off because of it, and they also know 
that. 
And not to mention, Madam Speaker, 
what about all the fraud? We don’t 
hear much about that. Did you realize 
there was $87 billion in fraud due to the 
unemployment compensation that was 
just sprawled out to whoever asked 
with absolutely no work requirements 
at all, and none exist in this bill either. 
We will be building back—not bet-
ter—we will be building back in a man-
ner that will be hurtful to my constitu-
ents and to my State and to our coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, the holidays are 
around the corner. Demand always in-
creases in the holidays. So the situa-
tion is going to get further exacer-
bated, without a doubt. You don’t need 
an economist to know that demand is 
going to continue to go up, supply will 
be minimal, inflation will rise due to 
the Build Back Better, which means 
there will be less workers. This is going 
to be the most expensive Christmas 
anyone can remember.

CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to continue to recognize the 
month of October as Cybersecurity 
Awareness Month and to further high-
light the importance of cybersecurity 
across our country. 
Our Nation’s safety and security are 
being challenged by enemies through 
cyberspace. As we have seen over the 
last year, these attacks can lie dor-
mant for many months before being de-
tected and can have devastating im-
pacts on our economy and way of life. 
Furthermore, these cyberattacks can 
be carried out by both state and 
nonstate actors with ease, as they are 
relatively inexpensive to execute. 
There are certainly effective ways to 
immediately respond to a cyberattack, 
yet victims are often constrained due 
to lack of capabilities, knowledge, or 
resources. 
In many ways cyberattacks have 
emerged as a near-perfect weapon 
against our Nation. During these last 
10 months in Congress, I have become 
aware 
of 
just 
how 
destructive 
a 
cyberattack can be on a small business. 
It makes no difference what the busi-
ness does. The only concern of the 
thieves is that the business be vulner-
able. That is what happened to a com-
pany in my district in rural north 
Georgia 3 years ago. 
The operations of a company that 
manufactured various bathroom fix-
tures came to a screeching halt when it 
was hijacked by a ransomware attack. 
This business was then forced to send a 
$100,000 ransom using cryptocurrency, 
bitcoin, to obtain the decryption key 
that would allow them to resume func-
tioning. For almost 5 weeks their oper-
ations were shut down by the attack. 
When I spoke to the business man-
agement team, they told me the attack 
happened so quickly that they were not 
sure what to do or to whom to turn. In 
the end, this business suffered a loss of 
over $1 million in hard currency— 
money that had to be paid out to fix or 
replace equipment and almost $10 mil-
lion in lost revenue. 
Any American or business can face 
the same horrifying reality. That is 
why it takes all of us to prevent these 
intrusions from occurring. It starts 
with fundamental cybersecurity prac-
tices that work to strengthen network 
resiliency; commonly known as good 
cyber hygiene. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity Cybersecurity and Infrastructure 
Security Agency, known as CISA, 
spearheads efforts to educate Ameri-
cans on what steps they can take to 
practice proper cyber hygiene. 
I fully support CISA’s efforts in this 
endeavor and encourage everyone, es-
pecially businesses, to take a look at 
the resources CISA has to offer to be 
more safe and more secure online. 
Madam Speaker, you can find them on-
line at www.CISA.gov. 
BIDEN BORDER CRISIS 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the ongoing and 
record-breaking Biden border crisis. 
Hidden in last Friday’s news dump, the 
latest data from Customs and Border 
Protection 
reveals 
Biden’s 
self-in-
flicted crisis at our southern border is 
far from over. Last month there were 
192,000 encounters at our southern bor-
der alone—a 232 percent increase from 
September of last year. This is the sev-
enth straight month of more than 
170,000 
illegal 
encounters—a 
trend 
never before recorded. 
This insanity must stop. The chaos 
at our southern border has now reck-
lessly reached over 1.4 million illegal 
border crossings since President Biden 
took office. Yet during the President’s 
townhall last week, he claimed that he 
hasn’t had time to visit the crisis that 
he created. Keep in mind, Madam 
Speaker, the President has managed to 
visit his Delaware beach house almost 
every weekend of his Presidency. 
It is shameful, Madam Speaker, that 
the President doesn’t feel the need to 
witness the very crisis that he created. 
I refuse to ignore this administration’s 
blatant dereliction of duty. The coun-
try needs to continue to hear about it 
until the issue is fixed, and I will con-
tinue working with my Republican col-
leagues to strengthen border security 
and put Americans first. 
RECESS

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God of light, shine on us this day. 
Bring clarity into this dark world and 
illumine the path that will lead us 
through the challenges we face and the 
difficulties we discover on our way. 
May we reflect Your light in our 
dealings with each other. May we find 
ways to brighten the lives of those we 
encounter and take the time to reveal 
with a kind word or a helpful gesture, 
the love that comes from You. 
Indeed, O God, this Congress serves 
as a city on a hill. Nothing they do can 
be hidden; all eyes are upon them. 
Let that vulnerability be a source of 
awareness of our dependence on You. 
Let that visibility be a source of hope 
for the Nation. 
Then let our light, our devotion, our 
dedication, our purest motives, and our 
noblest intentions, shine before others 
that You would be glorified. 
In the light of Your mercy and in the 
strength of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5883 
October 26, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor People Incor-
porated, a leading nonprofit and human 
service agency in western New York. 
This year, People Incorporated is 
celebrating its 50th year of service to 
western New Yorkers with intellectual 
and developmental disabilities, as well 
as families and older adults. 
The agency was founded in 1970 by a 
small group of parents and profes-
sionals to better meet the needs of peo-
ple with disabilities and their loved 
ones. 
Since then, People Incorporated has 
grown and expanded its services. They 
currently serve over 10,000 individuals 
and families every single year. 
People Incorporated provides access 
to housing and healthcare in a safe and 
welcoming environment. Their innova-
tive services have helped thousands of 
people across western New York to live 
independently. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
thanking People Incorporated for 50 
years of compassionate community 
care. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DORIS 
WILZ 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of a mother, grandmother, great-grand-
mother, small business owner, and a 
dear friend to many in my hometown 
of Ottumwa. 
On October 20, Doris Wilz passed 
away at the age of 93. Born and raised 
in Ottumwa, Doris was known by many 
as being the one who always went 
above and beyond for the betterment of 
the community. As a young widow, 
Doris met Karl Wilz, a small business 
owner and also recently widowed with 
four small children, the youngest of 
which was around three. They got mar-
ried, and Doris went forward to help 
him conduct two small businesses in 
two towns 30 miles apart. 
Whether it was through serving cus-
tomers at one of the family’s small 
businesses or volunteering at Ottumwa 
Regional Health Center, comforting pa-
tients and making cookies for the fam-
ilies at McCreery Cancer Center, Doris 
always loved to put a smile on the face 
of others. 
But when asked what her greatest 
passion in life was, Doris would say her 
four children, 12 grandchildren, and 
seven great-grandchildren. 
Doris’ gentle smile, melodious laugh, 
and encouragement meant so much to 
so many and drew people to her, in-
cluding myself, and I am honored she 
considered me a friend. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Doris for 
contributing to our community, and I 
will keep her, her family, and her loved 
ones in my prayers. 
LEADING THE CHARGE TO FIGHT 
THE CLIMATE CRISIS 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today, not alone, but on the 
shoulders of hundreds of advocates and 
activists leading the charge to fight 
this climate crisis with the urgency it 
demands. 
Over the past couple months, I have 
stood here almost every week calling 
for bold investments in clean energy 
infrastructure and climate solutions in 
the Build Back Better Act. 
But I know when we pass the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill and the Build 
Back Better Act, it will be because of 
the efforts of so many advocates. 
For years, Nevadans from the Nevada 
Conservation League, the League of 
Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, 
Chispa, the Environmental Defense 
Fund, and Battle Born Progress and so 
many other hardworking organizations 
have come together to demand climate 
action. 
Now, thanks to your hard work, I am 
confident that we will pass historic in-
vestment in clean energy infrastruc-
ture and build back better for our fu-
ture. 
The time to act on climate is now. 
f 
DEMOCRATS FAIL TO LIVE UP TO 
PROMISES 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS OF Texas. Madam 
Speaker, 
President 
Biden 
and 
the 
Democrats promised back in March 
their $1.8 trillion American Rescue 
Plan would end the pandemic and get 
us on a path of economic recovery. 
Well, it was a lie. 
It is now 8 months later, and neither 
has 
been 
accomplished. 
What 
the 
Democrats’ failed recovery plan has 
done is caused the highest inflation 
rate in decades, worsened the supply 
chain crisis, and eliminated the incen-
tive to work, fallen over a million jobs 
short of President Biden’s and Speaker 
PELOSI’s job guarantees. 
More lies. 
On top of failed economic progress, 
this summer we saw one of the worst 
surges of COVID since the pandemic 
started. 
And now we are witnessing President 
Biden and Speaker PELOSI pushing for 
trillions more dollars to deliver their 
radical socialistic agenda and more 
lies. 
Democrats fail to live up to any of 
the promises they have made to the 
American people, and the taxpayers 
have lost total trust and confidence in 
their pathetic leadership and their lies. 
In God we trust. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
EMPOWER MEDICARE TO 
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
I stand for patients and taxpayers in 
support of empowering Medicare to ne-
gotiate drug prices and to pass on the 
savings to lower out-of-pocket costs. 
We must seize this once-in-a-genera-
tion opportunity to make healthcare 
affordable and to promote the develop-
ment of new cures. 
Some policymakers have argued that 
lowering costs and sustaining bio-
medical R&D are an either/or propo-
sition, that Medicare negotiation for 
all drugs in parts B and D must nec-
essarily degrade innovation. I disagree. 
Cracking down on exploitations of ex-
clusivity with thoughtful policy could 
turbocharge 
new 
therapeutics 
and 
lower the price of old ones with the ef-
fect of lowering out-of-pocket costs for 
patients, 
promoting 
high-impact 
science, and saving the government 
money that Congress can use to expand 
health insurance for low-income Amer-
icans and senior citizens. 
That policy is within reach, and I 
strongly support meaningful Medicare 
negotiation in the Build Back Better 
agenda. 
f 
HONORING HUBERT PETERKIN 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, Hoke County Sheriff 
Dr. Hubert Peterkin died unexpectedly 
last Friday during surgery and from a 
previous unannounced affliction of can-
cer. For the people of Hoke County, 
whom Sheriff Peterkin served in that 
capacity for 19 years, it has been a dev-
astating shock and loss. I consider it to 
have been my honor and privilege to 
have gotten to know him briefly. 
Sheriff Peterkin wore the badge over 
three decades. His fellow sheriffs elect-
ed him vice president and then presi-
dent of the North Carolina Sheriffs’ As-
sociation. But, of course, as sheriff, he 
maintained not only law and order but 
community cohesion in that special 
way that rural communities through-
out my State do so well. Peterkin’s 
terrific presence earned him many 
awards and recognitions, including the 
Order of the Long Leaf Pine and the 
key to the city of Raeford. 
Sheriff Peterkin leaves behind his 
wife and two children to cherish his 
memory as well as many colleagues 
and friends. The people of Hoke County 
will miss his leadership, and I join 
them in lifting up the Peterkin family 
in prayer.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5884 
October 26, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the late Jesse 
Gomez and his lovely wife, and good 
friend of mine, Rosemarie Gomez. 
Jesse was elected East Chicago city 
councilman in 1963, making him the 
first person of Hispanic descent to be 
elected to political office in East Chi-
cago. Jesse’s time in office opened po-
litical doors for the Hispanic commu-
nity throughout the city and northwest 
Indiana. 
Jesse’s wife, Rosemarie, was elected 
to replace him on the council, making 
her the first Hispanic female to serve 
in political office in East Chicago. 
Rosemarie dedicated much of her time 
to the East Chicago Public Library, 
volunteering countless hours to help 
support readers and future leaders. 
Rosemarie was also very proud to help 
decorate an annual Mexican-themed 
Christmas 
tree 
for 
the 
library’s 
‘‘Christmas Around the World’’ exhibit. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation’s success 
is reliant upon the rich heritage and 
cultural diversity of its people, includ-
ing the extraordinary contributions of 
citizens such as Jesse and Rosemarie 
Gomez. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
(Mr. PFLUGER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, cri-
sis after crisis after crisis. 
We now know that over 2.1 million 
people have illegally entered this coun-
try this year. That is 1.7 million who 
have been apprehended, the highest 
number ever on record. And 400,000 ad-
ditional gotaways that the administra-
tion is now owning up to; yet we know 
nothing about them, we know nothing 
about their intent for this country, we 
know nothing about what they are 
doing. 
And more fentanyl has been seized by 
CBP at our southern border to kill 
seven times over every single Amer-
ican. 
Even as migrant caravans with thou-
sands of migrants march toward our 
border, this administration continues 
to mislead and deny that we have a cri-
sis. 
I am extremely concerned about who 
is facilitating these caravans and what 
organizations are involved in the drug 
and human trafficking along the way. 
The blame for this crisis falls square-
ly on the Biden administration and his 
open-border policies. Biden has aban-
doned Texans, and this administra-
tion’s blatant disregard and incom-
petence for border security is endan-
gering every single American. Let me 
again say that the President is aban-
doning not just Texans, but every 
American. 
This administration needs to get 
back to work, and I urge the Demo-
crats to come to the table. 
RECOGNIZING WAYNE METRO 
COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to please join me in rec-
ognizing the outstanding accomplish-
ments of Wayne Metro Community Ac-
tion Agency, a service organization 
based in Wayne County, Michigan, in 
my district. 
Today, they celebrate 50 years of as-
sisting southeastern Michigan’s most 
vulnerable populations, a truly re-
markable milestone. 
Wayne Metro’s staff and organiza-
tional leadership’s holistic approach to 
serving our communities translates to 
exceptional service that has put many 
families on the path to a better quality 
of life. 
Whether it is connecting a resident 
to emergency housing, helping with 
utility payments, or financial coach-
ing, Wayne Metro has been a trusted 
agency for so many of my residents. 
Their longevity is a testament to the 
trust in their reputation as a respon-
sive and caring community partner in 
service. It has always been one of the 
main reasons I work very closely with 
them. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
congratulate 
Wayne Metro Community Action Agen-
cy on 50 years of service and best wish-
es on many more to come.

HONORING TROOPER TED BENDA 
(Mrs. HINSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and the passing 
of a hero with deep roots in the tight- 
knit community of Waukon, Iowa, 
Iowa State Patrol Trooper Ted Benda. 
On October 14, Trooper Benda was on 
duty, answering the calls of citizens in 
northeast Iowa, when he experienced a 
tragic accident. He later passed from 
his injuries on October 20. 
This is the devastating loss of a fa-
ther, a husband, a son, a friend, a men-
tor, a dedicated public servant who 
made it his life’s mission to keep his 
community safe in Iowa. 
This tragedy is a reminder that brave 
law enforcement officers often sacrifice 
for a purpose greater than themselves. 
So I join all Iowans in mourning the 
loss of Trooper Benda, and my heart is 
with his family, his friends, and fellow 
troopers during this very difficult 
time. 
f 
HONORING CORPORAL HUNTER 
LOPEZ 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of U.S. Marine Corps 
Corporal Hunter Lopez and to urge the 
Senate to pass H.R. 5142 to give our Na-
tion’s servicemembers who perished in 
Afghanistan on August 26, 2021, the rec-
ognition they deserve. 
H.R. 5142 would posthumously award 
the Congressional Gold Medal, our Na-
tion’s highest honor, to the 13 heroes in 
uniform we lost that day, including my 
constituent, Marine Corporal Hunter 
Lopez from Indio. 
Corporal Lopez gave his life to save 
the lives of others. In fact, just mo-
ments before the explosion went off, he 
had pulled two little girls out of the 
fleeing crowd, preventing them from 
being crushed and saving their lives. 
Because of him, two children now have 
a future and the promise of a new life, 
many thousands reached safety, and 
many others have a reason to hope. 
And because of his efforts and the 
work of his fellow servicemembers, 
over 120,000 of our fellow Americans 
and allies were able to evacuate, and 
our Armed Forces completed the larg-
est airlift in human history. 
Madam Speaker, we must honor their 
sacrifice to our Nation. We must award 
them the Congressional Gold Medal. 
f 
HEAT YOUR HOME TAX 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to address the 
heat your home tax that Democrats 
are adding to the partisan reconcili-
ation package during our country’s 
crippling economic crisis. 
Americans are paying the most for a 
gallon of gas in 7 years, and now the 
Federal Government is warning Ameri-
cans that their home heating bills 
could cost 54 percent more this winter 
compared to last. 
This harmful provision authorizes 
the EPA to assess a $1,500 tax per ton 
of methane emissions on energy pro-
ducers, transmission, storage, proc-
essors, import and export, and pipe-
lines. As a result, gas prices will con-
tinue to skyrocket, heating bills will 
increase up to $242 per year, and thou-
sands of jobs could be eliminated in the 
economy. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Americans 
will 
physically feel the effects of Demo-
crats’ senseless tax hike when choosing 
whether they can afford to heat their 
homes this winter. Instead of address-
ing our country’s energy crisis at hand, 
Democrats are actively working to 
make it worse. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to consider these chilling ef-
fects and vote against the Democrats’ 
reckless reconciliation package.

minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to emphasize how important our ac-
tions today are for domestic violence 
survivors everywhere. 
Domestic violence is yet another 
pandemic in this country. In my dis-
trict, we have seen a rise in domestic 
violence during the COVID–19 pan-
demic amongst teenagers. 
Survivors of domestic violence carry 
their experiences with them every sin-
gle day, experiencing fear, chronic 
stress, self-doubt, depression, and so 
much more. This emotional trauma 
can prevent survivors from accessing 
and maintaining safe housing, employ-
ment, and supportive relationships, 
leading to feelings of isolation that 
only worsen their mental health. 
Organizations in my district, like 
Safe Horizon, Westhab, Family Serv-
ices of Westchester, and the YWCA are 
a lifeline of support for survivors of do-
mestic violence. The Federal Govern-
ment should support groups on the 
ground like them doing this important 
work. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly believe 
that together we can prevent all vio-
lence and create a culture of care for 
one another. This legislation, which 
will authorize funding for preventative 
and culturally responsive services, is 
an essential step toward this vision. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to co-
sponsor this bill, and I rise in support 
of its passage. 
f 
CRISIS AFTER CRISIS 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, the 
Biden administration and Democrats 
are causing one crisis after another, 
whether it is the disastrous withdrawal 
from Afghanistan; whether it is open 
border policy where caravans are com-
ing here; whether it is increasing gaso-
line prices at the gas pump, increasing 
grocery prices, a shortage of goods so 
that we can’t even get gifts at Christ-
mas. Now the Biden administration 
and the Democrats want to pass a nat-
ural gas tax, which will cause heating 
prices and electricity to skyrocket. 
Yet, at the same time that he wants 
to decrease natural gas in America, he 
is calling on OPEC to increase natural 
gas so that we can rely on it here in 
America. This makes absolutely no 
sense to me. It is as if he wants to hurt 
everyday Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I object to these 
policies, and I hope that my Demo-
cratic colleagues do, too. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are once again reminded to refrain 
from engaging in personalities toward 
the President. 
f 
THE IRS IS WATCHING 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the Fed-
eral Government needs to stop sticking 
its noses in places it does not belong. 
For the past 9 months, the size and 
scope of the Federal Government have 
expanded like a balloon being inflated 
with helium. Look no further than a 
provision in the Democrats’ budget rec-
onciliation package that allows the 
IRS to monitor the bank accounts of 
every American. If you made a deposit 
or withdrawal of more than $600 cumu-
latively, the IRS would be the first to 
know. That is $28 a day. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple are fearful of more government 
control, and I share their fear. America 
should never find itself standing at so-
cialism’s door, and this dangerous pro-
vision puts us one step closer to doing 
so. 
f 
IRS SURVEILLANCE PLAN 
(Mr. BOST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, $10,000 a 
year, an average of $200 a week. Under 
the Democrats’ IRS surveillance plan, 
that is all you will need to spend before 
they require the IRS to collect per-
sonal information on your bank trans-
actions. 
Let’s put that in perspective. Accord-
ing to the USDA, an average family of 
four on a low budget paid roughly $196 
per week for groceries in 2019. That is 
almost enough right there to require 
your bank to turn over your informa-
tion. 
Now, with skyrocketing inflation and 
the costs getting higher and higher— 
and what if you pay rent, have credit 
card bills, a car payment, or need to 
buy gas that you can drive back and 
forth to work to support your family? 
That can easily exceed the threshold, 
and probably five times over. 
This proposal is not simply targeting 
the richest Americans or big corpora-
tions. It means the IRS would have the 
personal information of almost every 
American with a bank account. This is 
an invasion of your privacy and a seri-
ous cybersecurity risk.

SEC. 19. ANALYSIS OF FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR FI-
NANCIAL STABILITY AMONG SUR-
VIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
DATING VIOLENCE, AND FAMILY VIO-
LENCE. 
Not later than 2 years after the date of the en-
actment of this Act, the Comptroller General of 
the United States shall conduct a study and 
issue a report that includes— 
(1) a review of what is known about the num-
ber of survivors of domestic violence, dating vio-
lence, and family violence in the United States; 
(2) statistical data, where available, for recent 
fiscal years, on the number of survivors de-
scribed in paragraph (1); 
(3) a description of the key Federal programs 
providing survivors described in paragraph (1) 
with financial and non-financial support; 
(4) an analysis of the gaps in current Federal 
programs, in terms of benefit adequacy and ben-
efit coverage for the population of survivors de-
scribed in paragraph (1); 
(5) a demographic analysis of the distribution 
of the gaps described in paragraph (4), for 
groups including racial and ethnic minorities, 
individuals with disabilities, tribal populations, 
and individuals who are geographically iso-
lated; 
(6) a review of challenges that could affect 
program utilization by the population of sur-
vivors described in paragraph (1); and 
(7) an indication of the extent to which Fed-
eral agencies or departments currently admin-
istering programs described in paragraph (3) 
have taken steps to ensure that survivors of do-
mestic violence, dating violence, and family vio-
lence have access to programs that will support 
their financial stability. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, is debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Education and Labor 
or their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT) and the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and insert extraneous materials 
on H.R. 2119. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge 
support for the bipartisan Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act of 2021 introduced by 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. 
MCBATH), the gentleman from Alaska 
(Mr. YOUNG), the gentlewoman from 
Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE), and the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. KATKO). 
Before I continue, I want to encour-
age anyone struggling with intimate 
partner violence to reach out to the 
National Domestic Violence Hotline at 
1–800–799–SAFE or the StrongHearts 
Native Helpline at 1–844–7NATIVE. 
Madam Speaker, it is difficult to 
overstate the need to address intimate 
partner 
violence 
in 
this 
country. 
Roughly 1 in 4 women and nearly 1 in 
10 men reported experiencing some sort 
of intimate partner violence. 
These incidents often cause severe 
physical injuries that portend even 
graver 
consequences, 
including 
the 
tragic loss of life. 
For survivors of violence, emotional 
trauma and intimate partner violence 
often last long after the physical inju-
ries have healed, triggering lifelong 
struggles with disease and mental 
health challenges. 
For decades, the Family Violence 
Prevention and Services Act has been a 
central pillar in our response to domes-
tic violence, authorizing services like 
shelters and 24-hour domestic violence 
hotlines. 
Regrettably, these programs have 
been technically expired since the end 
of 2015. Although funding has contin-
ued, updates to the law have been long 
overdue. For example, we know that 
the COVID–19 pandemic has increased 
the risk of intimate partner violence 
and restricted access to critical serv-
ices for survivors. 
H.R. 2119 strengthens our fight in 
this public health crisis by updating 
the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act in two important ways. 
First, it prioritizes equity by expand-
ing funding to reach communities that 
have disproportionately high rates of 
intimate partner violence but limited 
access to services. 
Second, it invests more in prevention 
so we can avert the physical danger 
and emotional trauma that survivors 
experience before it occurs. 
These updates represent the next 
steps we must take not only to support 
the survivors who need it most, but 
also to prevent intimate partner vio-
lence from harming our communities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.R. 2119, the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act. 
A survey by the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, CDC, esti-
mated that one-third of all men and 
women are victims of domestic vio-
lence at some point in their life. In 
2018, approximately 40 percent of fe-
male homicides in North Carolina were 
related to intimate partner violence. 
The 2020 statistics aren’t any better. 
b 1230 
COVID–19 
and 
President 
Biden’s 
failed economic policies have dealt our 
Nation government-mandated restric-
tions and economic challenges. It ap-
pears those negative outcomes have 
snowballed to exacerbate an even worse 
fallout. 
Evidence suggests that in this pan-
demic environment, stress due to work, 
school, substance abuse, and financial 
struggles have added to more violence 
in the home. Especially hard-hit appear 
to be rural areas where job opportuni-
ties can be hard to find. Recent statis-
tics show that domestic violence-re-
lated homicides have increased in my 
home State of North Carolina. 
Domestic violence in any form is an 
evil that demands a strong response. 
That is why, in 1984, Congress enacted 
the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act, FVPSA, which authorizes 
programs to support victims of domes-
tic violence and their dependents. 
These programs include grants to sup-
port domestic violence shelters and 
services and a national domestic vio-
lence hotline. 
Additionally, 
FVPSA 
funds 
the 
CDC’s DELTA program, which provides 
funding to State domestic violence 
coalitions to develop, test, and coordi-
nate local prevention and education 
programs. Since FVPSA’s enactment, 
Congress has worked in a bipartisan 
manner to reauthorize the bill. Sadly, 
Democrats are now using it as a vehi-
cle to push left-wing priorities. This is 
disappointing. 
Committee Republicans wanted to 
support a bipartisan bill. I strongly be-
lieve that FVPSA’s history of biparti-
sanship must be continued. However, 
the Democrat bill before us puts spe-
cial interest groups ahead of victims of 
domestic violence. 
H.R. 2119 paves the way for taxpayer- 
supported abortions. Forcing the public 
to pay for abortions is morally repug-
nant and should not be allowed to

stand in this bill or any bill. Previous 
reauthorizations of the law included a 
prohibition preventing reimbursement 
for healthcare services, but this bill 
drops that prohibition. 
The bill also tramples the rights of 
faith-based providers by forcing organi-
zations to abandon their sincerely held 
religious beliefs or give up helping vic-
tims through these programs, meaning 
that fewer victims will be able to ac-
cess vital services and care. Faith- 
based providers who offer critical care 
to 
survivors 
of 
domestic 
violence 
should not be obstructed from oper-
ating. 
Additionally, this bill lacks common-
sense accountability that is needed 
after years of Congress ignoring this 
program. We need to know what is 
going on with the program and the Re-
publican substitute would ensure we 
have that information. 
FVPSA is not an instrument for par-
tisan policies, or it should not be, espe-
cially those that threaten religious lib-
erties. That is why Republicans offered 
an amendment that includes a care-
fully focused set of reforms that act in 
the best interest of victims of family 
violence and the people who serve 
them. Specifically, it improves current 
law, ensuring that funds are focused on 
life-saving supportive services. Demo-
crats opposed it in committee, and I 
am guessing they will oppose it on the 
floor. 
Republicans recognize the impor-
tance of supporting survivors of domes-
tic violence. We must understand that 
dealing with this issue is best done at 
the local level and government cannot 
always provide the answers. Local civic 
groups and faith-based providers are 
best positioned to provide aid and de-
liver it effectively. 
Congress should support best prac-
tices and protect the providers closest 
to the victims seeking help. Pushing 
faith-based providers out of this impor-
tant work—as the Democrat-led bill 
could do—does nothing to help con-
tinue the delivery of locally-driven 
support services for victims of domes-
tic violence. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2119, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH), 
the lead sponsor of the legislation. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Chairman BOBBY SCOTT 
of the Education and Labor Committee 
and staff, and my colleagues that have 
joined me on this policy and lifesaving 
legislation for the diligence and the 
commitment towards keeping Ameri-
cans safe and saving lives. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Family Violence Prevention 
and Services Improvement Act, a long 
overdue reauthorization of the Nation’s 
oldest law providing Federal support to 
survivors of intimate partner violence. 
Known as FVPSA, this law is the pri-
mary source of Federal funding for in-
timate partner violence prevention and 
services and provides vital services for 
victims all over the United States. 
This bill funds shelters, State domes-
tic violence coalitions, a national do-
mestic violence hotline, and national 
resource centers that offer technical 
assistance to service providers. Despite 
its pivotal role in combatting domestic 
violence, FVPSA has not been reau-
thorized since 2015. It is far past time 
that Congress acts to pass a com-
prehensive reauthorization of this vital 
law. 
During this pandemic, we have seen a 
dramatic rise in the number of cases of 
family and domestic violence. While 
attempting to stay safe from the 
COVID–19 virus that has swept this 
country, many children and families 
were forced to face the violence that 
awaited them inside their own homes 
and further isolated them from their 
support systems. 
Violence in the home can have a 
tragic and drastic effect on children, 
stunting their emotional and cognitive 
growth and affecting their performance 
in school and their social development. 
This early trauma can cause long-last-
ing effects in a person’s life and impact 
their success as adults. We must make 
sure that our children and their fami-
lies have the resources they need to 
prevent domestic violence and abuse. 
I have seen too many families in my 
home State of Georgia suffer at the 
hands of domestic and family violence. 
We must protect these families and 
families all across the Nation. 
This legislation has broad bipartisan 
support within both Chambers of Con-
gress and from stakeholders on the 
front lines of combatting domestic vio-
lence in America. Our community part-
ners recognize that this legislation is 
critical to protecting and supporting 
our families and our children. 
The 
reauthorization 
makes 
key 
changes to current law, most impor-
tantly, by ensuring equitable access to 
resources for Native Tribes and Tribal 
coalitions, authorizing a Tribal domes-
tic violence hotline, authorizing re-
source centers for Alaska Native and 
LGBTQ populations, expanding funding 
for prevention so that every State and 
coalition 
receives 
prevention 
re-
sources, and authorizing grants for un-
derserved populations and culturally 
specific services for racial and ethnic 
minority groups. It helps provide sur-
vivors a way up, a way out, and a way 
forward. 
Some of my colleagues have argued 
that the LGBTQ anti-discrimination 
clause in this legislation will result in 
discrimination against religious orga-
nizations who provide services to vic-
tims of domestic violence. This could 
not be further from the truth. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter in support of this legis-
lation from the Catholic Charities of 
the Archdiocese of Chicago. 
THE CATHOLIC CHARITIES, 
ARCHDIOCESE OF CHICAGO, 
Chicago, IL, October 15, 2021. 
Rep. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Education & 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Rep. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, CHAIRMAN
SCOTT, AND
REPUBLICAN 
LEADER MCCARTHY: Catholic Charities is one 
of the largest social services providers in the 
Midwest, and I am honored to serve as its 
Chief Program Officer. 
For 104 years, Catholic Charities has 
served and accompanied anyone in need in 
Greater Chicago. Every year, Charities’ helps 
nearly 200 survivors of domestic violence and 
those at high risk through emergency shel-
ter, safety planning, counseling, legal serv-
ices, and transitional housing. Our wrap- 
around services and partnerships help sur-
vivors and in many cases their children im-
prove stability and restore security. 
Pre-pandemic, we knew that people experi-
encing domestic violence in Illinois were 95% 
women, 55% Black, and 13% Latinx. Forty- 
three percent resided in Chicago and 40% 
were low-income. 
The survivors we serve at Catholic Char-
ities Chicago face staggering challenges. One 
hundred percent live below the federal pov-
erty line. They come to us as survivors of in-
tergenerational trauma. They fear losing 
their children. They often have prolonged ex-
posure to substance use and are experiencing 
homelessness or housing instability. Almost 
universally, they are in poor physical and 
emotional health. 
Survivors are often isolated due to cultural 
factors, language barriers, lack of familial 
support, and lack of awareness of their law-
ful protections. Moreover, they have inad-
equate support once they leave the abusive 
situation. 
It is often the church, and Catholic Char-
ities, to which survivors turn. The role of 
trusted, faith-based providers in this service 
arena is profound. 
COVID–19 has only compounded the strug-
gles faced by survivors. Since the pandemic 
began, the Illinois Domestic Violence Hot-
line reports a 15% increase in calls and a 
2,000% increase in text messages requesting 
help. Additional burdens include financial 
stress, unemployment, isolation, increased 
family conflict, and deepening mental health 
issues. For persons experiencing domestic 
abuse, lockdowns and other COVID restric-
tions have forced them to spend more time 
with their abuser and less time with their 
support networks, increasing survivors’ dif-
ficulty trying to flee. 
A grim reality is that flight from an abu-
sive situation often leaves survivors without 
a place to call home. In response, Catholic 
Charities operates two transitional housing 
programs for domestic violence survivors. 
While families are in a safe environment, 
Charities supports them on their journey to-
ward healing and recovery with a long-term 
goal of securing permanent housing and sta-
ble employment. We offer free legal services 
including facilitating orders of protection 
and court representation in matters of child 
support and custody. 
Although survivors may reside with us for 
up to two years, families typically transition 
after 12 to 14 months. Once a one-year hous-
ing agreement is secured, Charities arranges

for the family to move into its new home. 
With Charities support, survivors arrive with 
a truckload of furniture, household supplies 
and clothing, and often with savings between 
$2,000 and $3,000. 
Most important is their increased self-suf-
ficiency and their deep connection to a sup-
portive, faith-based community. Our pres-
ence continues in many survivors’ lives 
through after care programming. For in-
stance, past residents attend support groups, 
in English and Spanish. Survivors continue 
coming to us for food, clothing, school sup-
plies, and other necessities. 
Even through COVID, 100% of the survivors 
we have served remained in stable perma-
nent housing. Prior to COVID, 68% sustained 
full-time employment; today employment is 
an ongoing struggle. Moreover, since the 
pandemic, Charities has seen a 25% increase 
in survivors coming back to us for basic ne-
cessities. Some may not have worked with 
our team in years—but our doors remain 
open. 
This past winter, we began offering new 
services for survivors of domestic violence 
on the Westside of Chicago, where African 
American and Latinx communities have 
been hardest hit by COVID. Our staff offer 
trauma-informed counseling and intensive 
case management. We are collaborating with 
churches, hospitals, and others to expand ac-
cess to free, confidential services for sur-
vivors. Together we are helping people re-
gain control of their lives and begin their 
healing process. 
Catholic Charities fulfills the Church’s role 
in the mission of charity to anyone in need 
by providing compassionate, competent and 
professional services that strengthen and 
support individuals, families and commu-
nities based on the value and dignity of 
human life. 
That’s why the FVPSA Re-Authorization 
Act of 2021 (H.R. 2119) is so important to 
Catholic Charities and to survivors in faith 
communities all across the country. Our 
shelters and healing recovery programs help 
survivors rebuild their lives with hope and 
dignity. 
Thank you for your leadership and the 
Committee’s work to eradicate gender-based 
violence through the bipartisan Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA), 
H.R. 2119. Catholic Charities endorses H.R. 
2119 which will provide core supports and en-
hance comprehensive responses to domestic 
violence and urges Members to vote YES on 
final passage. FVPSA provides critical sup-
port for shelters, coalitions, training and 
technical assistance centers, children’s serv-
ices, 
emergency 
response 
hotlines, 
sup-
portive services, and prevention initiatives. 
We must continue to consider the ripple ef-
fect violence imposes on the health and well- 
being of IPV survivors. Access to resources 
and continuous supports can be a turning 
point in a survivor’s journey towards healing 
and living free from violence. Your contin-
ued leadership in the passage of this bill is 
an action of service that responds to those 
needs in trauma informed and culturally re-
sponsive ways. 
Thank you again for your leadership on be-
half of survivors, their families, and their 
communities around the country. 
Sincerely, 
AMI NOVORYTA, 
Chief Program Officer, 
Catholic Charities of 
the Archdiocese of 
Chicago. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Since coming to Con-
gress, I have focused on protecting the 
children and families of Georgia and 
everyone all across this Nation, along 
with children and families throughout 
this great Nation that we all serve here 
today. 
Working in close partnership with 
local, State, and Tribal leadership, this 
bipartisan legislation would reauthor-
ize and expand funding for programs fo-
cused on preventing family and domes-
tic violence, while also protecting its 
survivors. 
I am so proud of this legislation and 
I am hopeful that it is one that we can 
all support. We must come together to 
support this law, recognizing that fam-
ily and domestic violence can affect all 
Americans, no matter where they come 
from. Domestic violence and family vi-
olence is not a partisan issue. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Georgia. 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, do-
mestic violence is not a partisan issue. 
Family violence is not a partisan issue; 
it is a public health crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues everywhere, Republicans and 
Democrats, to support the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act by voting ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 
2119. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Person Speak-
er, I rise today in strong opposition to 
H.R. 2119. 
The other side of the aisle claims 
that this would help families, but in-
stead, it would devastate them. The 
bill would coerce faith-based providers, 
as the gentlewoman from North Caro-
lina has already said, to violate their 
deeply held beliefs or stop their work 
altogether. 
This bill would redefine the defini-
tion of sex, and it inserts gender iden-
tity language into U.S. Code. Isn’t that 
the objective of this administration, 
this majority, to force our faith-based 
providers out of business and to rede-
fine sex and to change the identifica-
tion of gender? 
My colleagues on the other side 
claim they want to protect the family, 
but instead, they have chosen to at-
tack the very bedrock of our country— 
the moral principles and the tradi-
tional family that hold our families 
and communities together. 
In 
fact, 
nearly 
everything 
that 
plagues our society can be attributed 
to a failure to follow God’s laws for 
morality and His rules for and defini-
tion of marriage and family. 
The very name of this bill is steeped 
in irony—the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act—as 
it would truly inflict more violence on 
unborn babies’ lives and force tax-
payers to fund the murder of unborn 
life; again, consistent with the goals 
and objectives of this administration 
and this Democrat majority. 
This would be a bad bill without its 
attack on the unborn. This would be a 
bad bill without its dangerous sexual 
orientation and gender identity provi-
sions, or SOGI. This is a bad bill be-
cause it spends over a billion dollars 
more in expansive and intrusive gov-
ernment. Violence is already illegal. 
We Republicans are against it in all 
forms. This is a matter for local and 
State law enforcement. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this bill, and I 
will be doing so. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on Civil 
Rights and Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 2119, the 
bipartisan Family Violence Prevention 
and Services Improvement Act. As pol-
icymakers, we have an obligation to do 
all we can to address the domestic vio-
lence epidemic and to support sur-
vivors. 
In 2021, the annual Domestic Vio-
lence Counts Report from the National 
Network to End Domestic Violence, 
found that more than 76,000 adults and 
children nationwide received poten-
tially lifesaving services from emer-
gency shelters and hotlines in one 24- 
hour period. Tragically, during that 
same day, more than 11,000 survivors’ 
requests could not be fulfilled because 
of a lack of resources. That is unac-
ceptable. 
We must better fulfill our responsi-
bility to the millions of survivors who 
carry the trauma of experiencing do-
mestic violence, and whose safety and 
well-being depends on access to these 
services. 
There is a clear need to update and 
strengthen our Federal programs to 
prevent intimate partner violence and 
better serve survivors. This critical re-
authorization includes a much-needed 
investment to increase funding for the 
Family Violence and Prevention Serv-
ices Act, which will help close national 
resource gaps. 
Additionally, communities of color, 
LGBTQ individuals, and people with 
disabilities face disproportionate rates 
of intimate partner violence while too 
often having limited access to services. 
Importantly, this bill will make sure 
that resources do reach culturally-spe-
cific programs and community-based 
organizations that are better equipped 
to serve the needs of survivors who face 
historic violence and systemic inequi-
ties. 
As chair of the Civil Rights and 
Human Services Subcommittee, I was 
honored to hold a hearing that exam-
ined evidence-based solutions to pre-
vent and end domestic violence. Pass-
ing this legislation takes a critical 
step in fulfilling our obligation to 
eradicate intimate partner violence 
wherever and whenever it occurs. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Congress-
woman MCBATH and Chairman SCOTT 
for their leadership in working to up-
date this important legislation to keep 
individuals and families safe, and I 
urge all of my colleagues to support 
the bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5898 
October 26, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters in support of the bill 
from the National Resource Center on 
Domestic Violence and the National 
Network to End Domestic Violence. 
NATIONAL RESOURCE 
CENTER ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
Harrisburg, PA, September 20, 2021. 
Rep. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Education & 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Rep. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, CHAIRMAN
SCOTT, AND
REPUBLICAN 
LEADER MCCARTHY: Thank you for your lead-
ership and the Committee’s work to eradi-
cate gender-based violence through the bi-
partisan Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119. The Na-
tional Resource Center on Domestic Vio-
lence (NRCDV) endorses H.R. 2119 which will 
provide core supports and enhance com-
prehensive responses to domestic violence 
and urges Members to vote YES on final pas-
sage. FVPSA provides critical support for 
shelters, coalitions, training and technical 
assistance centers, children’s services, emer-
gency response hotlines, and prevention ini-
tiatives. 
In addition to its broader systems impact, 
for over 25 years FVPSA has been a critical 
resource to NRCDV’s efforts to provide 
training, technical assistance, and resource 
development. Through programming such as 
the National Capacity Building Center on 
Safe and Supportive Housing for Domestic 
Violence Survivors and web resource reposi-
tories such as VAWAnet, which receives 
300,000 site visits per day—an average of 800 
visits per day from 210 countries and terri-
tories around the world, NRCDV can lead in-
novative and equitable solutions that ad-
dress the housing needs of survivors and re-
source needs of organizations serving them. 
FVPSA also supports NRCDV’s work to 
prevent 
domestic 
violence 
through 
the 
PreventlPV Project. This project enhances 
the capacity of state/territory domestic vio-
lence coalitions and community-based do-
mestic violence programs to advance a com-
prehensive national prevention agenda and 
broaden support for the full implementation 
of the agenda at the national, state, terri-
tory, and local levels. Additionally, the plat-
form provides communities with access to an 
inventory of searchable tools and materials 
utilized and developed by prevention experts 
from across the country. 
Finally, FVPSA supports NRCDV’s work 
to support the facilitation, coordination, and 
strategic collaboration amongst the Domes-
tic Violence Resource Network (DVRN). The 
DVRN informs and strengthens domestic vio-
lence intervention and prevention efforts at 
the individual, community, and society lev-
els through a network of two national re-
source centers, four special issue resource 
centers, three culturally specific resource 
centers, five emerging issue resource cen-
ters, and the National Domestic Violence 
Hotline. These examples are only a minor 
representation of the ways FVPSA supports 
the work of NRCDV and enhances the impact 
of on the ground advocacy efforts. 
As you lead the efforts to pass H.R. 2119, 
Family Violence Prevention and Services 
Improvements Act, we thank you again for 
your leadership on behalf of survivors, their 
families, and their communities around the 
country. 
Sincerely, 
SHENNA MORRIS, M.A., 
Director of Policy, Na-
tional Resource Cen-
ter on Domestic Vio-
lence. 
NATIONAL NETWORK TO END 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, 
Washington, DC, September 27, 2021. 
Rep. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Education & 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Rep. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, CHAIRMAN
SCOTT, AND
REPUBLICAN 
LEADER MCCARTHY: On behalf of our 56 mem-
ber state and territorial domestic violence 
coalitions, their more than 2,000 local pro-
grams, and the millions of victims they 
serve, the National Network to End Domes-
tic Violence (NNEDV) commends the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee for passage of 
the bipartisan Family Violence Prevention 
and Services Improvement Act (FVPSA), 
H.R. 2119. H.R. 2119 would bolster existing 
FVPSA programs and increase authorized 
funding, while expanding access to tribes, 
tribal coalitions working to end domestic vi-
olence, culturally specific programs, and 
other underserved communities. We write 
today to express NNEDV’s strong support for 
the bill as reported out of Committee and to 
urge all Members to vote yes on final pas-
sage. 
FVPSA is at the heart of our nation’s re-
sponse to domestic violence services and sup-
ports lifesaving services including emer-
gency shelters, crisis hotlines, counseling, 
legal assistance, and prevention education 
for communities throughout the United 
States, American Indian and Alaska Native 
communities, and U.S. territories. First au-
thorized in 1984 and administered by the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, 
FVPSA is the only federal funding source 
dedicated to domestic violence shelters and 
programs. FVPSA expired in 2015 and must 
be reauthorized with key enhancements in 
order to meet the growing needs of survivors. 
Over 1,500 local, public, private, nonprofit, 
and faith-based organizations domestic vio-
lence programs rely on FVPSA-funding to 
keep their doors open to more than 1.3 mil-
lion victims seeking safety each year. 
NNEDV’s 15th Annual Domestic Violence 
Counts reports that on just one day in 2020, 
76,525 domestic violence victims and their 
children received essential services ranging 
from shelter to counseling to legal advocacy. 
However, on that same day, 11,047 requests 
for services went unmet due to lack of re-
sources. Many communities and tribes cur-
rently have very limited access to FVPSA 
funds. H.R. 2119 would bolster existing 
FVPSA programs and increase authorized 
funding, while expanding access to tribes, 
tribal coalitions working to end domestic vi-
olence, culturally specific programs, and 
other underserved communities. It is vital 
that access to FVPSA funds be expanded 
through the passage of this bill. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has disproportion-
ately affected survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, and family violence. Sur-
vivors are at risk in a time of heightened 
economic, health, familial, and emotional 
trauma. Direct service providers are also 
grappling with the unprecedented challenge 
of housing survivors and providing life-sav-
ing services while following distance and 
separation 
protocols. 
The 
improvements 
made in this bill will greatly help meet the 
needs of survivors in the current crisis and 
beyond. 
The important improvements in H.R. 2119 
reflect the priorities of the domestic vio-
lence field and the diverse needs of survivors. 
These improvements include: 
Bolstering and investing in lifesaving core 
victim services and shelters; 
Expanding support for and access to cul-
turally specific programs by authorizing a 
new grant program to provide enhanced ac-
cess to services for racial and ethnic minor-
ity populations; 
Strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
Indian 
tribes to exercise their sovereign authority 
to more fully respond to domestic violence 
in their communities by increasing resources 
for tribes, authorizing funding for tribal coa-
litions, and authorizing the currently funded 
Alaska Native Women’s Resource Center; 
Meaningfully investing in domestic vio-
lence prevention by increasing support for 
evidenceinformed prevention projects and 
funding new initiatives that bring these ap-
proaches to more communities across the 
country; 
Creating a new underserved populations 
grant program; and 
Increasing the funding authorization level 
to respond to very low per-program funding 
levels and adjusting the current formula to 
increase access to FVPSA funds for pro-
grams not currently funded. 
The bipartisan Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act (H.R. 
2119) provides meaningful investments in and 
expanded support for lifesaving domestic vio-
lence shelters and services, including preven-
tion, 
throughout 
the 
country. 
NNEDV 
strongly endorses H.R. 2119 as reported out of 
Committee and urges all Members to vote 
yes on final passage. 
Sincerely, 
DEBORAH J. VAGINS, 
NNEDV President and CEO.

Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Mrs. MIL-
LER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I cannot in good conscience 
support legislation that opens the door 
to Federal dollars being used to harm 
our most vulnerable—the unborn. 
Current law prohibits Federal fund-
ing from being used to pay for reim-
bursements for medical services while 
still allowing domestic violence vic-
tims to obtain referrals to have their 
healthcare needs met. This prohibition, 
coupled with the longstanding Hyde 
amendment included in annual appro-
priations, has long been supported by 
Democrats, including President Biden. 
This precedent ensures that tax dol-
lars under this law do not pay for abor-
tion services either directly or indi-
rectly. 
Sadly, committee Democrats are pro-
posing to strike this prohibition from 
the law. Along with their public inten-
tions to strike the Hyde amendment, I 
am concerned that this bill could lead 
to taxpayer dollars being used to fund 
abortions instead. 
My amendment would have main-
tained current law and made clear that

FVPSA funds cannot be used for abor-
tion services or abortion referrals. This 
will ensure that even as Democrats 
make an extreme push to repeal Hyde, 
these funds will not be used for such 
services. 
A Marist Poll from earlier this year 
indicated that 58 percent of Americans 
opposed taxpayer funding of abortion— 
or we could say inducement for women 
to have abortions. We should not force 
taxpayers to fund services that violate 
their strongly held beliefs. This amend-
ment ensures that this does not occur. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms. MAN-
NING), who is a distinguished member 
of the Committee on Education and 
Labor. 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a letter of support 
from Jewish Women International. 
JEWISH WOMEN INTERNATIONAL, 
Washington, DC, October 8th, 2021. 
Rep. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Education & 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, CHAIRMAN
SCOTT, AND
REPUBLICAN 
LEADER
MCCARTHY: Jewish Women Inter-
national JWI) writes to urge the House to 
vote yes on the final passage of the Family 
Violence Prevention and Services Improve-
ments Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119 which pro-
vides essential support for domestic violence 
shelters and programs. 
The core funding provided by FVPSA sup-
ports more than 1,500 local public, private, 
nonprofit, and faithbased organizations and 
programs and over 240 Tribes and Tribal or-
ganizations in their response to the urgent 
needs of over 1.3 million domestic violence 
victims and their children. This act also cre-
ates a new underserved populations grant 
program which will enable these groups to 
receive services from culturally specific pro-
grams that they are more likely to seek as-
sistance from and that can better meet their 
needs. 
JWI understands that FVSPA (H.R. 2119) 
clarifies that discrimination based on sexual 
orientation or gender identity is prohibited 
under the law. This is in line with existing 
law. JWI strongly and urgently is in support 
of the non-discrimination clarification in-
cluded in H.R. 2119. 
JWl’s work focuses on the nexus of faith 
and domestic violence. As the convener of 
the National Collaborative of Jewish Domes-
tic Violence Programs, the Clergy Taskforce 
on Domestic Abuse in the Jewish Commu-
nity, and the Interfaith Coalition Against 
Sexual and Domestic Violence, JWI is well 
aware of the critical supports provided by 
faith communities to survivors and their 
children. Our 2021 National Needs Assess-
ment on Domestic Abuse in the Jewish Com-
munity confirms that survivors seek domes-
tic violence services that are inclusive of 
their religious traditions and that maintain 
their connection to their existing religious 
community. 
JWI understands that FVSPA (H.R. 2119) 
clarifies that discrimination based on sexual 
orientation or gender identity is prohibited 
under the law. This is in line with existing 
law. JWI strongly and urgently is in support 
of the non-discrimination clarification in-
cluded in H.R. 2119. Our deeply held religious 
values mandate treating all people with dig-
nity and respect and providing all survivors 
with the services they require. 
We urge the House to pass the full FVPSA 
to avoid failing the more than a million sur-
vivors and children who rely on these pro-
grams and ensure their needs are met. 
Sincerely, 
MEREDITH JACOBS, CEO, 
Jewish Women International. 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express my strong support 
for the reauthorization of the Family 
Violence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act. This act was the first 
Federal law to provide resources for 
survivors of domestic violence and re-
mains the primary source of funding 
for shelters. 
This critical legislation hasn’t been 
reauthorized since 2010, leaving vital 
programs like crisis counseling and 
safety planning underfunded and out-
dated. In North Carolina, a staggering 
35 percent of women and 30 percent of 
men experience intimate partner vio-
lence or stalking. COVID–19 has only 
further increased intimate partner vio-
lence rates and has put a strain on 
services survivors urgently need. 
No individual should have to endure 
the trauma of domestic violence. We 
must ensure victims have access to the 
support and resources necessary for 
their safety and well-being. We cannot 
turn our backs on our neighbors in 
need. During this Domestic Violence 
Awareness Month, I urge my colleagues 
to join me in reauthorizing this impor-
tant act. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman from Illi-
nois (Mr. BOST), who is the ranking 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, preventing domestic 
violence 
and 
supporting 
survivors 
should never be a partisan issue. Unfor-
tunately, this bill makes it one. 
First, by removing the prohibition on 
reimbursements for healthcare serv-
ices, my colleagues across the aisle 
would allow for Federal funding from 
this bill to be used to pay for abortion 
services. 
Secondly, it includes provisions that 
will effectively bar faith-based organi-
zations from participating in these do-
mestic violence prevention and sur-
vivor support programs. These organi-
zations play a vitally important role in 
providing support to women, children, 
and families who are in need. 
We should be providing survivors 
with as many lifelines as we can, not 
alienating care providers based on 
their religious beliefs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this bill to protect the lives of the 
unborn and request we revisit a clean 
reauthorization of this legislation. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. MRVAN) who 
is a distinguished member of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman SCOTT for this time. 
Madam Speaker, throughout my ca-
reer, I have witnessed the direct, posi-
tive impact of programs and shelters 
such as the St. Jude House in Crown 
Point, Indiana, and the Haven House in 
Hammond, Indiana, which provide hope 
and resources for survivors and help 
prevent and protect against domestic 
violence. That is why I rise today in 
strong support of H.R. 2119, the Family 
Violence Prevention Act and Services 
Improvement Act. 
The increase in domestic partner vio-
lence is alarming, particularly as many 
individuals 
have 
lost 
valuable 
re-
sources to aid them due to the pan-
demic and are forced to remain in close 
quarters with their abusers. As an ad-
ministrator of emergency assistance 
for 15 years, I remain deeply concerned 
about the mental, physical, and emo-
tional trauma survivors and their chil-
dren endure. 
As one of the most effective Federal 
investments in preventing domestic vi-
olence, Congress must pass this meas-
ure to reauthorize and improve family 
violence and prevention service pro-
grams. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
leadership of Chairman SCOTT, Rep-
resentative MCBATH, and the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, and I en-
courage my colleagues to support this 
measure. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, currently the Sec-
retary of HHS has unimpeded author-
ity to create resource centers under 
FVPSA that are meant to provide vic-
tims of domestic violence with help. 
Unfortunately, the number of resource 
centers has grown in recent years with-
out the public’s knowledge. A brief 
look at the websites of these organiza-
tions reveals that a number of these 
centers are using taxpayer money to 
promote a progressive ideology on gen-
der and sexuality instead of simply 
supporting victims of domestic vio-
lence. Taxpayers deserve to know the 
mission and purpose of these resource 
centers and whether they are effective. 
The Republican substitute requires 
the Secretary to provide notice to Con-
gress before creating additional re-
source centers. Additionally, it re-
quires the Government Accountability 
Office to issue a report on the effec-
tiveness of these resource centers and 
provide recommendations for improve-
ments on how they can do a better job 
delivering services to victims. 
Madam Speaker, money is scarce and 
getting scarcer, and we need to know 
that taxpayer dollars are being spent 
wisely. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-

who is a distinguished member of the 
Committee on Education and Labor. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the bipartisan Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act of 2021, and, quite hon-
estly, it is just mind-boggling to me 
that anybody could find anything to 
criticize about this bill. 
Since it was signed into law four dec-
ades ago, the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act has 
remained the main source of Federal 
funding for the domestic violence shel-
ters in which so many of the most vul-
nerable people in our society find safe-
ty. 
Despite the progress that we have 
made in this country in acknowledging 
the scourge of domestic violence, Con-
gress has not provided the necessary 
resources to keep pace with this crisis. 
This bill would reauthorize programs 
that have not been fully funded in 
more than a decade, since 2010—pro-
grams that are a literal lifeline for all 
those who are facing domestic violence 
across the country. 
Domestic violence affects millions of 
Americans. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control, around one in five 
homicide victims across our Nation are 
killed by an intimate partner, and ap-
proximately one in every five women 
and one in every seven men in the 
United States will experience major 
physical violence from an intimate 
partner at some point in their lives. 
Madam Speaker, we must pass this 
critical legislation. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, victims of domestic 
violence should not lose important 
faith-based assistance simply because 
bureaucrats in Washington don’t share 
the same beliefs. Our freedom of reli-
gion is the number one freedom out-
lined in the Bill of Rights, and yet our 
friends often on the other side of the 
aisle seem to forget that and want to 
trample on that right. Faith-based pro-
viders have helped victims of domestic 
violence for years, and they should not 
be forced to abandon their mission be-
cause progressives want to use tax-
payer resources to promote a progres-
sive ideology on gender and sexuality. 
As we learned from our witness at a 
hearing on this program, sometimes 
victims need to hear from faith leaders 
to feel really safe and able to get help. 
We should not jeopardize that lifeline. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
ADAMS), who is the chair of the Sub-
committee on Workforce Protections. 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in strong support of re-
authorizing the Family Violence Pro-
tection and Services Improvement Act. 
As a survivor of intimate partner vio-
lence, I can tell you that this piece of 
legislation is so very important. 
For 37 years the bipartisan Family 
Violence Prevention and Services Act 
has supported survivors of domestic vi-
olence and their children. FVPSA helps 
local governments and service pro-
viders prevent violence. It protects 
families and victims in their most vul-
nerable moments. This time around, 
FVPSA has strong components of cul-
turally specific programs, underscoring 
the sad truth: that victims from all 
communities need support. 
This reauthorization comes at a crit-
ical time for State and local organiza-
tions in this space. The COVID–19 pan-
demic has not only led to an increase 
in domestic violence, it has also led to 
budget cuts for many organizations 
which work to combat violence. 
Whether it is in the House of Rep-
resentatives or the house next door or 
my house, we must always speak out 
against the harmful effects of violence, 
especially against women. 
Madam Speaker, let’s pass this bill. 
We will keep working for a future free 
from domestic violence and intimate 
partner violence. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on behalf of America’s sur-
vivors of domestic violence, millions of 
whom live in every corner of this coun-
try and every single congressional dis-
trict represented here today. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to vote 
to pass the Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Improvement Act so 
that we can expand support, protec-
tion, and prevention for these sur-
vivors. 
But we must do more. In a recent 
survey of domestic violence service 
providers, 90 percent reported increased 
demand for mental health services; 
however, only 12 percent of respondents 
said that their program is very pre-
pared to meet the needs of adult sur-
vivors with more severe or disabling 
mental health challenges. 
We need help with mental healthcare 
in this country. I don’t think that is a 
secret to anybody. That is why my 
amendment would ensure domestic vio-
lence coalitions can partner with men-
tal health and substance abuse pro-
viders for domestic violence programs. 
By passing this amendment, we can 
provide survivors with the mental 
health support they need and deserve, 
especially those from underserved com-
munities, including: racial and ethnic 
minorities, people with disabilities, 
seniors, and youth. 
b 1300 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the Democrats’ bill 
strikes a current law provision that re-
quires certain grant recipients to pro-
vide a non-Federal match for the tax-
payer 
dollars 
they 
receive 
under 
FVPSA. 
Madam Speaker, I agree with my col-
leagues who have indicated that fund-
ing for domestic violence is not a Fed-
eral responsibility. It is a State and 
local responsibility. The 10th Amend-
ment of the Constitution said if their 
responsibilities were not outlined in 
the Constitution for the Federal Gov-
ernment to do, then those responsibil-
ities were left to the States and to the 
people themselves. 
However, I am a realist. The Federal 
Government stepped into this space, in 
a bipartisan manner, many, many 
years ago. So, taxpayers paying taxes 
at the Federal level have been sup-
porting these programs for a long time. 
However, it is appropriate that there 
be a local match for this to show that 
local people have an interest in these 
programs and believe they should be 
supported. 
Furthermore, Democrats are refusing 
to acknowledge that we are nearly $30 
trillion in debt and going up in debt 
quickly, going down the tubes quickly. 
Their radical taxing and spending spree 
is intended to create the largest Fed-
eral Government expansion since the 
New Deal. Frankly, many of them brag 
about this, which is unbelievable to 
me. 
But Republicans are committed to 
ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effi-
ciently and effectively. That is why the 
Republican substitute amendment and 
my amendment ensure the important 
non-Federal match provision under 
FVPSA remains in place. We need some 
local skin in the game. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Domestic violence diminishes us all, 
and we all have a role to play to pre-
vent abuse, save lives, and protect vic-
tims, which is why I stand in strong 
support of my colleague and friend 
Congresswoman MCBATH’s Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act. 
This thoughtful legislation will ex-
pand funding for lifesaving services, 
such as emergency shelter, a crisis hot-
line, counseling, and legal assistance. 
It is focused on protecting survivors 
and preventing domestic violence. 
The need for safe spaces is in des-
perate demand. This need has only in-
creased with the pandemic. Abusers are 
now leveraging circumstances to exert 
new power and control tactics, like 
withholding information about COVID– 
19 and preventing access to medical 
care. 
Our work must match this uniquely 
challenging time, and I believe this 
legislation does just that. 
Recently, I visited Laurel House, a 
domestic violence nonprofit organiza-
tion in my district, and I think of how 
this bill would support their mission. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive MCBATH. This legislation will save 
lives. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time.

Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. And still I rise, 
Madam Speaker. And I thank the 
chairman, Chairman SCOTT, for the op-
portunity to be heard. 
Madam Speaker, I support this legis-
lation because, on any given night or 
day, in 2020, around 11,000 requests for 
domestic violence services went unmet, 
and this was due to a lack of resources. 
We have the resources; they are just 
not getting to the people. 
This is what we can do to make a dif-
ference in the lives of 11,000 people. I 
will do what I can. I support the legis-
lation. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a 
Statement of Administration Policy in 
support of the legislation. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 2119—FAMILY
VIOLENCE
PREVENTION
AND 
SERVICES
IMPROVEMENT
ACT
OF
2021—REP. 
MCBATH, D–GA, AND 83 COSPONSORS 
The 
Administration 
strongly 
supports 
House passage of H.R. 2119, the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Improvement 
Act of 2021. Congress first enacted the Fam-
ily Violence Prevention and Services Act 
(FVPSA) in 1984 to provide resources to ad-
dress domestic violence as a public health 
issue and to support life-saving services and 
prevention programs throughout the nation. 
FVPSA, last reauthorized in 2010, allocates 
funding to states and territories that reaches 
over 1,500 domestic violence shelters and 
services programs, as well as funding for 
over 240 tribes and tribal organizations, to 
address and prevent domestic violence and 
dating violence. FVPSA also provides fund-
ing for a network of state and territorial do-
mestic violence coalitions, the National Do-
mestic Violence Hotline, and national tech-
nical assistance providers that provide train-
ing and capacity building to ensure that 
vital services and support are available to in-
dividuals experiencing domestic violence and 
their children. Additionally, FVPSA funds 
the DELTA program, which provides funds 
to design, implement, and evaluate innova-
tive domestic violence and dating violence 
prevention models. 
As a result of FVPSA funding, each year 
approximately 1.3 million survivors receive 
critical services such as emergency shelter, 
crisis counseling, safety planning, assistance 
in seeking an order of protection, and assist-
ance recovering from financial abuse and ad-
dressing housing insecurity. Nonetheless, re-
search demonstrates that the need for serv-
ices continues to outpace availability and 
many survivors are unable to access critical 
services 
and 
support. 
Furthermore, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic has exacerbated eco-
nomic insecurity, increased isolation, and 
compounded barriers faced by victims and 
survivors in seeking safety and stability, 
particularly for those from historically 
marginalized communities. 
H.R. 2119 is a bipartisan bill that will au-
thorize increased funding to strengthen ex-
isting services while expanding access to 
tribes and tribal coalitions, culturally-spe-
cific programs, and other underserved com-
munities. It will also expand investments in 
domestic violence prevention by increasing 
support for existing evidence-based, commu-
nity projects and by funding new initiatives 
to reach more communities nationwide. The 
Administration urges swift passage of this 
legislation. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a let-
ter from the family violence preven-
tion working group, a coalition of na-
tional organizations working on do-
mestic violence issues. 
SEPTEMBER 20, 2021. 
Rep. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. STENY HOYER, 
Majority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Rep. BOBBY SCOTT, 
Chairman, House Committee on Education & 
Labor, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
Rep. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, MAJORITY LEADER 
HOYER, CHAIRMAN
SCOTT, and REPUBLICAN 
LEADER MCCARTHY: The undersigned organi-
zations thank the Committee for passage of 
the Amendment in the Nature of a Sub-
stitute (ANS) to the bipartisan Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Improvements 
Act (FVPSA), H.R. 2119, to re-authorize core 
support and enhance comprehensive re-
sponses to domestic violence, family vio-
lence, and dating violence. We write today to 
express our profound support for the bill and 
write to urge all Members vote yes on final 
passage. FVPSA provides critical support for 
shelters, coalitions, training and technical 
assistance centers, children’s services, emer-
gency response hotlines, and prevention ini-
tiatives. This bill also expands grant pro-
grams and makes many needed improve-
ments to ensure more survivors of domestic 
violence, family violence and dating violence 
have access to support and safety. 
FVPSA provides core funding to support 
more than 1,500 local, public, private, non-
profit and faith-based organizations and pro-
grams and over 250 tribes and tribal organi-
zations in responding to the urgent needs of 
over 1.3 million domestic violence victims 
and their children. As you know, there is 
still an urgent need to increase survivors’ ac-
cess to these vital programs as well as to ad-
dress current unmet needs. Estimates show 
that due to a lack of capacity, nearly 200,000 
requests for shelter can go unmet in a year. 
As demonstrated in the annual survey of the 
National Network to End Domestic Violence, 
in just one day in 2020, programs across the 
country were unable to meet 11,407 requests 
from survivors (requests for emergency shel-
ter, housing, transportation, childcare, coun-
seling, legal representation, and other sup-
portive services). 
The COVID–19 pandemic has disproportion-
ately affected survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, and family violence. Sur-
vivors are at risk in a time of heightened 
economic, health, familial, and emotional 
trauma. Direct service providers are also 
grappling with the unprecedented challenge 
of housing survivors and providing life-sav-
ing services while following distance and 
separation 
protocols. 
The 
improvements 
made in this bill will greatly help meet the 
needs of survivors in the current crisis and 
beyond. 
The important improvements in H.R. 2119 
reflect the priorities of the domestic vio-
lence field and the diverse needs of survivors, 
including: 
Increasing the funding authorization level 
to address very low per-program funding lev-
els and provide access to FVPSA funds for 
more programs not currently funded. 
Updating provisions and definitions to en-
sure access to services for all survivors, bet-
ter alignment with related statutes, and re-
flect evolving best practices amongst service 
providers to provide uniform guidance to the 
domestic violence field. 
Strengthening 
the 
capacity 
of 
Indian 
Tribes to exercise their sovereign authority 
to respond more fully to domestic violence 
in their communities, and authorizing fund-
ing for tribal coalitions and the currently 
funded Alaska Native Women’s Resource 
Center. 
Bolstering 
support 
for 
all 
survivors 
through a grant program that increases the 
capacity of culturally specific community- 
based organizations to expand access to safe-
ty for survivors of color, as well as provi-
sions that promote best practices. 
Providing a more robust investment in pre-
vention by bringing evidence-informed pre-
vention initiatives to more tribes, states, 
and local communities across the country. 
Continuing and expanding support for na-
tional technical assistance (TA) centers and 
their work to develop effective policy, prac-
tice, research, and cross-system collabora-
tions. 
Updating provisions to include additional 
access and resources for survivors with dis-
abilities and Deaf survivors, including a new 
TA center on enhancing accessible services 
for those survivors. 
Updating provisions for the National Do-
mestic Violence Hotline and hotline services 
for underrepresented populations, including 
American Indians, Alaskan Natives and Deaf 
survivors. 
Creating an underserved grant program to 
increase access to safety for populations that 
face additional barriers. 
We must continue to ensure that when sur-
vivors take the courageous step to reach out 
for support, individuals, organizations and 
institutions are prepared to address the risks 
faced by survivors and their children and im-
prove efforts to create pathways to enhanced 
safety and well-being. 
As you lead the efforts to pass the bill out 
of the House, we thank you again for your 
leadership on behalf of survivors, their fami-
lies, and their communities around the coun-
try, and hope the bill moves swiftly through 
a vote by the full House of Representatives 
on final passage.

outstanding leadership to this issue. 
And I thank my good friend, Congress-
woman MCBATH, for her outstanding 
leadership on helping to reauthorize 
this very important legislation that 
really saves lives. 
In my own district, we lost a heroic 
Sergeant Preston of the Houston Police 
Department for one of the most dan-
gerous calls that police get, domestic 
violence. He was killed. The 11-year-old 
son was shot, but, thank God, he sur-
vived. What terrible, senseless vio-
lence. 
We know that in this program, more 
than 76,000 people a day are helped. It 
is important to take note of the fact 
that intimate partnership violence is a 
crucial element of this legislation. To 
be able to reauthorize the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act is to save lives. 
In addition, it is important to take 
note of my amendment that has been 
accepted. I look forward to debating it 
on the floor and the $2 million extra 
that the State of Texas will give. 
But the most important part of it is 
the recognition that we will save lives 
and help to bring families together and 
to unify the Nation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I yield the 
gentlewoman an additional 1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. As indicated, 
76,000 victims of domestic violence are 
helped, but 11,000 are unable to get help 
because of the lack of funding. 
It is important, as well, to note that, 
on average, more than one in three 
women and one in four men in the 
United States will experience rape, 
physical violence and/or stalking by an 
intimate partner. 
It is also important to relieve the 
regulations, the strangulations that 
were on this bill before. It now opens it 
to up provide more to individuals who 
are suffering. 
What we want to do is to end family 
domestic violence, and what we want 
to do is to end that intimate partner 
violence and bring families together, 
protect children. I am supporting this 
legislation, and I believe it is long 
overdue. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the 
Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. 2119, the 
Family Violence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act, which makes a good bill even 
better. 
I thank my colleague, Congresswoman 
MCBATH of Georgia, for introducing this impor-
tant legislation which will improve the protec-
tion and prevention for Americans affected by 
family violence, domestic violence, and dating 
violence. 
The Jackson Lee Amendment improves the 
bill by requiring the Comptroller of the United 
states to produce a report on the success of 
outreach efforts to minority communities. 
Through the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (FVPSA), survivors receive serv-
ices such as emergency shelter, crisis coun-
seling, safety planning, and assistance recov-
ering from financial abuse and housing insecu-
rity. 
FVPSA is the only federal funding source 
dedicated to providing support to domestic vio-
lence shelters and programs. 
Madam Speaker, this bill marks an historic 
effort to acknowledge and address the unique 
suffering of family violence survivors from 
marginalized communities. 
I thank the Rules Committee for including 
my amendment, because this amendment is 
straightforward and makes this important bill 
even more effective than it already is. 
We must recognize that not all survivors are 
a monolith. 
Different communities and cultures have dif-
ferent perceptions of domestic violence and 
reactions to it—therefore different communities 
and cultures need different treatments and 
prevention measures to address domestic vio-
lence. 
That is why I am proud to support this bill, 
which includes provisions that are tailored to 
these specific populations. 
Such provisions include: 
1. Providing new grants to local programs 
serving culturally specific or traditionally under-
served communities; 
2. Increasing access for survivors from ra-
cial and ethnic communities to services by 
creating a national grant program to build the 
capacity to address domestic violence; and 
3. Increasing funding for Native American 
tribes by allocating tribal grants as a set-aside 
to acknowledge their sovereign authority. 
These are laudable initiatives, and my 
amendment goes a step ’ further to sustain 
this commitment by adding a requirement that 
the Comptroller of the United States must 
produce a report on the success of outreach 
efforts to minorities. 
Specifically, my amendment requires the 
Comptroller General to include in the study 
and report described in Section 19 the results 
of outreach efforts conducted pursuant to sec-
tion 308 to certain groups—including racial 
and ethnic minorities, individuals with disabil-
ities, tribal populations, and individuals who 
are 
geographically 
isolated—regarding 
in-
creasing the availability and ease of access to 
services. 
Simply put, receiving accurate feedback 
about our efforts will inform our decision-mak-
ing, allowing us to adapt and improve upon 
our programs to reach more minority sur-
vivors. 
It is these communities specifically that are 
in the most need of our help. 
In my home state of Texas, 29 percent of 
domestic violence victims are Black despite 
making up only 12 percent of the population. 
The share of domestic violence victims in 
Texas who are Native American is twice as 
much as the proportion of Natives in the gen-
eral population. 
Madam Speaker, no member should be 
complacent with these egregious statistics. 
With this bill’s increased commitment to pre-
vention and treatment of family violence, we 
are sending a message to survivors that you 
are not forgotten. 
For these reasons, I encourage all Members 
to support H.R. 2119, the ‘‘Family Violence 
and Prevention Services Improvement Act.’’ 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close. I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, this bill contains a 
number of provisions that are well- 
known poison pills for Republicans. 
Democrats can’t claim this is a bipar-
tisan bill when it takes far-left posi-
tions on multiple social issues that are 
unrelated to FVPSA’s purposes. 
This bill was rejected on a party-line 
basis at a committee markup. Demo-
crats ignored the long history of bipar-
tisan reauthorizations and included 
poison pills and not moving forward. 
The Senate was able to leave politics 
at the door, and there is no reason for 
the House not to do the same. 
Madam Speaker, the majority of 
Americans oppose using their hard- 
earned money to pay for abortions. A 
Marist Poll conducted earlier this year 
showed that as many as 58 percent op-
pose using tax dollars to fund abor-
tions. 
We have repeatedly seen Democrats 
attack the lifesaving Hyde amendment. 
This, along with the removal of a long-
standing prohibition on using FVPSA 
funding to reimburse for healthcare 
services, would risk forcing taxpayers 
to fund abortions under this program. 
FVPSA dollars are meant to offer 
hope and healing to victims of domes-
tic violence, not bring harm to inno-
cent lives. 
Madam Speaker, victims of domestic 
violence deserve access to the expertise 
and resources necessary to aid them in 
their time of crisis, free from political 
interference. The Democrats’ partisan 
proposal could harm the unborn and 
obstruct high-quality providers from 
offering services to domestic violence 
victims. 
As I said before, FVPSA should not 
be an instrument for partisan policies, 
especially those that threaten religious 
liberties. 
Committee Republicans want to con-
tinue FVPSA’s history of bipartisan-
ship, yet Democrats have upended the 
previously bipartisan balance between 
prevention services and support for vic-
tims and children at the behest of spe-
cial interest groups. This is shameful. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on H.R. 2119, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Madam Speaker, I have to respond to 
a comment about the budget. I would 
point out and remind everyone that 
since 
the 
1960s, 
every 
Democratic 
President has ended an administration 
with a better deficit situation than 
they inherited, without exception. And 
every Republican administration has 
ended their administration with a 
worse deficit situation than they inher-
ited, without exception. The last Presi-
dent was well on his way to fulfilling 
that trend before the pandemic. 
The Build Back Better and the trans-
portation plans are in the process of 
being paid for so they will not be add-
ing to the deficit. 
Madam Speaker, each person in this 
Chamber should agree that we must do 
more to address intimate partner vio-
lence in this country. The critical serv-
ices for survivors under the Family Vi-
olence Prevention and Services Act

October 26, 2021 
have now expired, have been expired for 
more than 5 years, and are in urgent 
need of updates. 
During the pandemic, many survivors 
have been isolated with their abusers, 
while the gaps in our response to do-
mestic violence have been exacerbated. 
This is not the time for Congress to 
stand by while our communities con-
tinue to endure the far-reaching and 
lifelong impacts of this public health 
crisis. Now is the time for Congress to 
take action. 
As we face new challenges during the 
pandemic, we must ensure that sur-
vivors in our most vulnerable commu-
nities have access to the support serv-
ices they need. We must prioritize ef-
fective prevention strategies that stop 
intimate partner violence from occur-
ring in the first place. 
Madam Speaker, each of us has the 
responsibility to do our part to fight 
against domestic violence. The bill be-
fore us is an opportunity to come to-
gether and reaffirm our commitment 
to supporting survivors and preventing 
all Americans from suffering the dev-
astating 
consequences 
of 
intimate 
partner violence. 
I want to thank all the bipartisan 
sponsors for their leadership and for 
their work to pass this urgent legisla-
tion. I urge my colleagues to support 
the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Improvement Act of 2021, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 2119, the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Improvement 
Act. 
October is Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month, and now more than ever, we must re-
commit ourselves to eliminating the threat of 
domestic violence and ensure survivors have 
the support they need to heal physically, men-
tally, and emotionally. 
The bill before us today is the only federal 
funding source dedicated to domestic violence 
prevention programs, and it is critical this bill 
is passed to continue funding lifesaving serv-
ices like emergency shelters, counseling, and 
crisis hotlines for survivors and their children. 
FVPSA has been a key pillar in our nation’s 
strategy to eradicate domestic violence. It has 
made a difference in my home state. and this 
bill is estimated to provide a 50 percent fund-
ing increase to $4.5 million that will undoubt-
edly strengthen care for survivors across 
Michigan. 
In addition to improving this law and in-
creasing its resources, we must continue 
working together to advance comprehensive 
legislative solutions that protect Americans 
from the threat of domestic violence. 
This issue is personal for me—I’ve seen it 
up close growing up. No woman, no child, no 
person, and no family should fear for their life 
because of domestic violence. That’s why I 
am a proud co-chair of the Bipartisan Working 
Group to End Domestic Violence, a group we 
established in 2018 to unite members from 
both sides of the aisle to achieve a common 
purpose: ending domestic violence. 
This is not a partisan issue—it’s an Amer-
ican issue—and I am honored to work along-
side a bipartisan coalition of members who are 
just as dedicated to accomplishing this task. 
Our goal today, tomorrow, and each day after 
will be to end domestic violence and ensure 
survivors are given the support they deserve. 
Earlier this year, the House also reauthor-
ized the Violence Against Women Act. This bill 
includes vital improvements to address gaps 
that have been identified by survivors, and I 
was glad several legislative pieces of mine 
were included in its reauthorization. 
My Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers 
Act was again included that would close loop-
holes that make it easy for domestic abusers 
to purchase weapons without passing a back-
ground check. Additionally, this bill reauthor-
izes the VAWA Health program at increased 
levels that helps train health care providers 
and strengthens collaborations between public 
health and domestic violence agencies. Fi-
nally, it includes my amendment that would 
update how survivors of domestic violence can 
obtain protection orders. 
Our work is far from over. Without reauthor-
ization of FVPSA and VAWA, programs to 
help survivors are losing critical funding. We 
must demonstrate that protecting and expand-
ing resources for survivors are top priorities. I 
urge all my colleagues to support me in pass-
ing this important piece of legislation, and l 
call on the Senate to swiftly act to protect sur-
vivors across the nation. 
I would like to thank leadership for bringing 
this bill to the floor and my colleagues, Reps. 
MCBATH, MOORE, YOUNG, and KATKO for their 
bipartisan work on this bill. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 2119—the Fam-
ily Violence Prevention and Service Improve-
ment Act. 
This bill heavily invests in resources and 
programs to protect and support women like 
Gladys Ricart, a 39-year-old-woman and 
former constituent of mine who was killed by 
her ex-boyfriend on her wedding day. 
After years of physical and mental abuse, 
she left him to move on with her life, even as 
he continued to threaten and stalk her. 
As she moved on, she met her soulmate, 
and was happy and eager to marry the man 
of her dreams. 
What should have been one of the happiest 
days of her life, was instead her last. Her ex- 
abuser fatally shot Gladys on her wedding 
day. But her legacy lives on and in 2001, the 
Brides March was created to remember Glad-
ys Ricart and to bring awareness to domestic 
violence. 
Heartbreakingly, Gladys’ story is not isolated 
or unique. 
By passing the Family Violence Prevention 
and Service Improvement Act, we also have 
an opportunity to honor her memory—her and 
the hundreds of thousands of women who 
have stories just like Gladys’. 
This crucial legislation would put millions of 
dollars towards expanding support for cul-
turally specific domestic violence programs, in-
vesting in community-based prevention initia-
tives, and creating an underserved population 
grant program. 
These resources would help to connect peo-
ple to advocates and help them safely navi-
gate life during and after leaving an abusive 
relationship. 
And as I think of all the resources this legis-
lation will make available, I think of Gladys 
and the hundreds of women who march on 
her behalf. 
I think about the one in three woman, par-
ticularly black and trans women, who will ex-
perience intimate partner violence in their life-
time. 
I think of the irreputable, lasting harm do-
mestic violence causes families and children. 
I think about all these lives that will be cata-
strophically changed or lost and I know that 
they deserved more. 
As we prepare to vote, I implore everyone 
to think of all the good the Family Violence 
Prevention and Services Improvement Act will 
do for all survivors. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, everyone, inside Congress and out, has a 
duty to stop domestic violence. 
Those of us in the House of Representa-
tives can fulfill that duty today by voting to re-
authorize and strengthen the Family Violence 
and Prevention Services program. 
Sadly, Atlanta experienced what research-
ers at Emory University called the ‘‘co-occur-
ring pandemics’’ of COVID–19 and domestic 
violence. The victims of both were dispropor-
tionately in marginalized communities. 
A strengthened Family Violence and Pre-
vention Services program may have prevented 
those acts of violence in the first place. This 
bill’s expanded resources will support organi-
zations like the Partnership Against Domestic 
Violence, and everyone else working in the 
Fifth District to end domestic violence. 
If you are a victim of domestic violence, I 
want you to know you are not alone. Please 
call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 
1 800–799–SAFE or text ‘‘START’’ to 88788. 
Thank you to my fellow Georgian LUCY 
MCBATH and to Chairman BOBBY SCOTT for 
their leadership in advancing this crucial legis-
lation. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote yes on the 
Family Violence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act because there are not two 
sides to this issue. You are either opposed to 
domestic violence or you aren’t.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and

utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there 
are 
six 
amendments in this en bloc. 
Mr. KAHELE has offered an amend-
ment which establishes the Native Ha-
waiian Resource Center on domestic vi-
olence. 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ
has offered an 
amendment to amend the definition of 
a child to include any child under 18, 
including emancipated minors. 
Mr. COHEN has offered an amendment 
to clarify grant eligibility for legal aid 
organizations. 
Ms. NEWMAN has offered an amend-
ment to clarify that domestic violence 
coalitions may partner with mental 
health and substance abuse disorder 
providers. 
Ms. JACKSON
LEE
has offered an 
amendment requiring the GAO study 
required in the underlying bill to in-
clude information on outreach to racial 
and ethnic minorities. 
Ms. BUSH has offered an amendment 
to clarify that domestic violence coali-
tions can provide training to housing 
service providers. 
These amendments make meaningful 
improvements to the bill. I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the amendments en bloc 
No. 1, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, while many of the 
amendments offered today by my Dem-
ocrat colleagues do not make the bill 
any worse, they fail to correct the sig-
nificant flaws of the underlying bill. 
Several amendments offered by Re-
publican Members would have im-
proved the bill, but Democrats blocked 
those amendments from being debated. 
Two of those I would like to high-
light quickly are: An amendment of-
fered by Congresswoman MARY MILLER 
to ensure FVPSA dollars cannot be 
used for abortion services or abortion 
referrals and an amendment offered by 
Congresswoman SPARTZ to ensure tax-
payers know the mission and purpose 
of the resource centers authorized 
under FVPSA. 
These amendments are needed to ad-
dress concerning changes the Demo-
crats make that open the door for tax-
payer 
funding 
of 
abortion 
under 
FVPSA and also double down on at-
tempts to advance a radical gender ide-
ology through FVPSA’s resource cen-
ters. 
The Democrats missed an oppor-
tunity to change course, work in a bi-
partisan fashion, and send the Senate a 
bill we know could become law. But 
they have decided to pursue partisan 
policy over protecting victims. 
Thankfully, this bill is not heading 
to the President’s desk, and I look for-
ward to working on making further 
needed improvements so victims can 
access the help they need from those 
they trust. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. COHEN), 
the chair of the Subcommittee on the 
Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil 
Liberties. 
Mr. 
COHEN.

Speaker,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5905 
October 26, 2021 
19 pandemic has been the increase of 
domestic and family violence that con-
tinues to affect Americans across the 
country. It has alarmingly gone up. We 
must do all we can to keep children 
and families safe throughout this pan-
demic and at all times. 
My amendment is part of the en bloc 
package, and it simply clarifies grant 
eligibility to include legal aid organi-
zations that provide violence preven-
tion services. 
There is a direct relationship be-
tween legal intervention and a decline 
in domestic violence. One study found 
that obtaining a permanent protection 
order resulted in an 80 percent reduc-
tion in physical violence in the 12 
months after initial client contact. 
Another study found that women rep-
resented by legal counsel obtained a 
protection order 83 percent of the time, 
while those without legal counsel only 
received a protection order 32 percent 
of the time. 
In the United States, 1 in 4 women 
and 1 in 9 men have experienced domes-
tic violence, resulting in tens of mil-
lions of Americans experiencing domes-
tic violence in their lifetimes. 
Legal aid is a critical prevention tool 
to help limit the damage domestic vio-
lence causes. 
I want to thank Chairman SCOTT, 
Legal Services Corporation, the Na-
tional Domestic Violence Hotline, and 
all of the domestic violence prevention 
organizations for their support of the 
inclusion of this amendment and the 
vital work that they do. 
I want to thank Reisha Buster on my 
staff, Kevin on my staff, and all of the 
other members of my staff. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this amendment and 
the overall bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE), the chair of the Subcommittee on 
Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Secu-
rity. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
let me thank the gentleman very much 
for his work, and again let me thank 
my 
colleague, 
Congresswoman 
MCBATH, a member of the Education 
and Labor Committee and a member of 
the Judiciary Committee. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support my 
amendment, and all of the other 
amendments, which in particular my 
amendment provides an outreach that I 
think is extremely crucial to providing 
an outreach to populations that have 
been unnecessarily victims of domestic 
violence. 
I do want to, again, emphasize the 
issue of Sergeant Preston, who died in 
the course of a police encounter with a 
domestic abuser with a gun, and to em-
phasize that an average of 24 people per 
minute are victims of rape, physical vi-
olence, or stalking by an intimate 
partner in the United States; more 
than 12 million women and men over 
the course of a year. Nearly 3 in 10 
women, or 29 percent, and 1 in 10 men, 
in the U.S. have experienced physical 
violence and/or stalking. 
This reauthorization is long overdue. 
Just under 15 percent of women, 14.8 
percent, and 12 percent of men in the 
U.S. have been injured as a result of in-
timate partner violence that included 
rape, physical violence, and stalking by 
an 
intimate 
partner. 
More 
impor-
tantly, how many of them have been 
killed? 
In my own district, we had a cir-
cumstance of a domestic violence inci-
dent where the woman was killed in 
the bed, and laying next to her was her 
newborn infant. The stories are with-
out comparison. 
When you talk to women’s shelters, 
the great need that they have and the 
funding that is going to come from this 
particular effort is $2 million to the 
State of Texas alone. The effort that is 
most important is vulnerable women, 
women of color, and Native Americans. 
The Tribal dollars that are in here are 
crucial as well. 
The Violence Against Women Act, I 
hope that we will see its passage in the 
Senate, along with the reauthorizing of 
the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Improvement Act as well, be-
cause we, too, address the question of 
Tribal women. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
Tribal circumstances are an enor-
mously difficult circumstance to be en-
gaged in. The abuse in the Tribal areas, 
and the utilization of vicious acts then 
coming out and not being prosecuted is 
really unseemly. 
But this is going to be intervention. 
This is going to be saving lives. 
I would just offer, as I close, a com-
ment on who we should expand this to: 
the 
LGBTQ 
community, 
the 
transgender, individuals who have to 
deal with the remnants of a rape. That 
is, of course, a pregnancy that my 
State, the State of Texas, has now vio-
lated all human dignity with their 
abortion bill that not only stops 
women from engaging with their faith 
leader, their family members, and their 
doctor, but it also stalks women and 
sends people out for a bounty to get 
$10,000. 
So this is the kind of uplifting legis-
lation, reauthorization after 10 years, 
that is going to address the question of 
women who are desperately in need and 
also protect law enforcement officers 
as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 30 sec-
onds to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this is also going to protect law en-
forcement officers as well. In tribute 
and memory to Sergeant Preston, a 
veteran of the HPD, the idea of being 
able to go and help and come back with 
your own life and protect those who 
are being victimized. The less we have 
of that and the more intervention that 
we have, the more we can save lives. 
So I want to claim that this par-
ticular legislation is lifesaving. I ask 
my colleagues to support the Jackson 
Lee amendment, which is, in essence, 
attempting to get more resources, 
more information, and support the 
Family Violence Prevention and Serv-
ices Improvement Act. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, again, these amend-
ments included in the amendments en 
bloc make meaningful improvements 
to the bill. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on en 
bloc No. 1, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, again, these amend-
ments do not make any further harm 
to the programs, but they also do not 
cure the flaws in the bill before us 
today. I do not oppose this en bloc but 
urge my colleagues to oppose the un-
derlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 2119, the ‘‘Family Vi-
olence and Prevention Services Improvement 
Act,’’ which will improve the protection and 
prevention for Americans affected by family vi-
olence, domestic violence, and dating vio-
lence. 
I would like to thank my good friend, Con-
gresswoman MCBATH, for championing this 
important legislation and shepherding it to the 
floor. 
Through the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act (FVPSA), survivors receive serv-
ices such as emergency shelter, crisis coun-
seling, safety planning, and assistance recov-
ering from financial abuse and housing insecu-
rity. 
The FVPSA supports life-saving services 
throughout the country via grants to states, 
tribal governments, and territories through 
three primary sets of activities, all of which are 
administered by HHS. 
First, the FCPSA funds a national domestic 
violence hotline that receives calls for assist-
ance related to this violence. The hotline pro-
vides crisis intervention and counseling, main-
tains a database of service providers, and pro-
vides referrals for victims and others affected 
by domestic violence. 
Second, FVPSA funds efforts to prevent do-
mestic violence through a program known as 
Domestic Violence Prevention Enhancement 
and Leadership Through Allies (DELTA). 
Third, FVPSA supports direct services for 
victims and their families. Most of this funding 
is awarded via grants to states, territories, and 
tribes. 
FVPSA is the only federal funding source 
dedicated to providing support to domestic vio-
lence shelters and programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5906 
October 26, 2021 
FVPSA provides base core funding to sup-
port more than 1,600 local public, private, non-
profit, and faith-based organizations and pro-
grams in their response to the urgent needs of 
over 1.3 million domestic violence victims and 
their children. 
In 2020, the National Network to End Do-
mestic Violence (NNEDV) found that in just 
one day, FVPSA-funded programs helped 
76,525 victims of domestic violence. 
However, over 11,000 people were unable 
to be served due to a lack of funding. 
This shortage of funding is especially severe 
with shelters serving rural and marginalized 
populations, and increased funding and cul-
turally-specific programs are essential to ad-
dressing the needs of these communities. 
FVPSA was first passed in 1984 and was 
most recently reauthorized in 2010. Its author-
ization expired in 2015. 
Madam Speaker, this bill marks an historic 
effort to acknowledge and address the unique 
suffering of family violence survivors from 
marginalized communities. 
Different communities and cultures have dif-
ferent perceptions of domestic violence and 
reactions to it—therefore different communities 
and cultures need different treatments and 
prevention measures to address domestic vio-
lence. 
That is why I am proud to support this bill, 
which includes provisions that are tailored to 
these specific populations. 
Such provisions include: 
1. Providing new grants to local programs 
serving culturally specific or traditionally under-
served communities; 
2. Increasing access for survivors from ra-
cial and ethnic communities to services by 
creating a national grant program to build the 
capacity to address domestic violence; and 
3. Increasing funding for Native American 
tribes by allocating tribal grants as a set-aside 
to acknowledge their sovereign authority. 
Simply put, receiving accurate feedback 
about our efforts will inform our decision-mak-
ing, allowing us to adapt and improve upon 
our programs to reach more minority sur-
vivors. 
It is these communities specifically that are 
in the most need of our help. 
In my home state of Texas, 29 percent of 
domestic violence victims are Black despite 
making up only 12 percent of the population. 
The share of domestic violence victims in 
Texas who are Native American is twice as 
much as the proportion of Natives in the gen-
eral population. 
In addition to addressing the special needs 
of minority communities, there is a litany of 
other exciting provisions in this bill that build 
upon the Family Violence Prevention and 
Services Act, such as: 
1. Increasing the funding authorization level 
to $253 million to address chronic under-
funding that resulted in 11,000 people not re-
ceiving services in a single day. 
2. Technologically updating the National Do-
mestic Violence Hotline and improving hotline 
services for underrepresented populations. 
3. Authorizing funding for tribal coalitions, 
which provide support to tribal domestic vio-
lence programs but are not currently author-
ized by statute to receive FVPSA funding. 
4. Authorizing new grants of up to $150,000 
to each state, territorial and tribal coalition to 
prevent domestic violence. 
A bill of this nature is incredibly important 
for my home state of Texas, where it is esti-
mated that 1 in 3 Texans will be a victim of 
domestic violence during their lifetime. 
Madam Speaker, no member should be 
complacent with these egregious statistics. 
With this bill’s increased commitment to pre-
vention and treatment of family violence, we 
are sending a message to survivors that you 
are not forgotten. 
For these reasons, I encourage all Members 
to support H.R. 2119, the ‘‘Family Violence 
and Prevention Services Improvement Act.’’

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 716, the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. FOXX) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, the Family Vio-
lence Prevention and Services Im-
provement Act provides critical serv-
ices to victims of domestic violence, 
and faith-based organizations are some 
of the leading providers of these serv-
ices. 
Unfortunately, the Democrats’ bill 
would change that by adding extreme 
provisions that stray from FVPSA’s 
important purposes and could limit 
participation of the important faith- 
based providers. 
The substitute amendment offered by 
Congresswoman LETLOW ensures that 
faith-based providers don’t have to 
choose between their beliefs or con-
tinuing to deliver the vital service and 
care that help protect victims. 
Congresswoman 
LETLOW’s 
amend-
ment also brings much-needed account-
ability to FVPSA. The law currently 
authorizes the Secretary to create do-
mestic violence resource centers, but 
these resource centers have been used 
to push a radical gender ideology rath-
er than help victims of domestic vio-
lence. 
That is why the substitute amend-
ment requires the Secretary to provide 
notice to Congress before creating ad-
ditional resource centers. Further, it 
requires 
the 
Government 
Account-
ability Office to issue a report on the 
effectiveness of these resource centers 
and provide recommendations for im-
provements on how they can do a bet-
ter job delivering services to victims. 
It has been too long since Congress 
has exercised effective oversight of this 
program, and it is time to change that. 
Beginning with the provisions in Con-
gresswoman LETLOW’s amendment, this 
law will finally have some real ac-
countability metrics. 
b 1330 
The Democrats’ bill also strikes a 
current law provision that requires cer-
tain grant recipients to obtain funding 
from sources outside the Federal Gov-
ernment, so Federal taxpayers are not 
on the hook for providing all of the 
funding. 
While Republicans are committed to 
ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effi-
ciently 
and 
effectively, 
Democrats 
refuse to acknowledge that we are 
nearly $30 trillion in debt. Their rad-
ical taxing-and-spending spree is in-
tended to create the largest Federal 
Government expansion since the New 
Deal, and this bill is the latest attempt 
by the Democrats to create further re-
liance on government, pushing out pri-
vate-sector involvement in these crit-
ical programs. That is why the amend-
ment I offered ensures the important 
non-Federal match provision under 
FVPSA remains in place. 
I urge my colleagues to support these 
amendments, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there 
are 
two 
amendments in this en bloc. First, as it 
has been explained, the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) has of-
fered an amendment to reinstate the 
State match requirement, and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Louisiana 
(Ms. 
LETLOW) 
has 
offered 
a 
substitute 
amendment, leaving out the majority 
of the programming improvements in 
H.R. 2119 and adding a problematic pro-
vision regarding abortion. 
These amendments undermine the bi-
partisan, bicameral progress included 
in H.R. 2119 and neglect to make any 
changes or enhancements to FVPSA 
programs. 
These amendments en bloc fail to 
meet the moment. There are a number 
of things they do: 
They halt the creation of a new re-
source center on disability and domes-
tic violence needed to counter the dis-
proportionate rates of intimate partner 
violence among people with disabil-
ities. 
They prevent Tribal governments 
from getting the resources they need to 
combat domestic violence, which oc-
curs at alarming rates in Tribal com-
munities. 
They strike grants that support sur-
vivors from racial and ethnic minority 
groups. Communities of color face dis-
proportionate rates of domestic vio-
lence and sexual assault and often ex-
perience barriers to accessing services.

They remove the addition of new pre-
vention grants to ensure prevention 
funding goes to every State, Tribe, and 
territory, despite the fact that cur-
rently only 10 States receive funding to 
do any prevention work, and this 
amendment maintains that status quo. 
These amendments would also rein-
state State matching fund require-
ments. Particularly during the ongoing 
pandemic and economic crisis, this 
would create significant operational 
challenges for service providers. For 
example, nonprofit organizations do 
not have the benefit of guaranteed 
funding and may struggle to meet 
match requirements. Ultimately, this 
means fewer services available for sur-
vivors. 
The amendments en bloc also include 
a partisan attack on abortion, under-
mining a comprehensive reauthoriza-
tion that can meaningfully improve 
the lives of survivors of intimate part-
ner violence. 
These amendments inject needless 
political controversy into this debate, 
undermining the hard work we have 
done to develop a comprehensive reau-
thorization. Instead of acknowledging 
the complexities of medical decisions 
for both women and their providers, 
abortion opponents use these bills and 
amendments like these as a distrac-
tion. 
These 
amendments 
threaten 
the 
progress we have made on the bill, and 
therefore I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on amend-
ments en bloc No. 2. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Lou-
isiana (Ms. LETLOW). 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate Dr. Foxx’s strong leadership of 
the committee and on this important 
issue. 
According to CDC estimates, at least 
one in three Americans has experienced 
sexual violence, physical violence, or 
stalking by a partner. For decades, 
Congress has worked in a bipartisan 
fashion to dedicate resources toward 
preventing and healing the suffering of 
these victims. 
But today, the bill we are consid-
ering, H.R. 2119, the Family Violence 
and Prevention Services Improvement 
Act, includes several highly concerning 
provisions. 
First, this bill opens the door for en-
tities to spend taxpayer dollars on 
abortions. 
Secondly, it forces an unnecessary 
conversation about sexual orientation 
and gender identity when these issues 
have never been a part of this bill be-
fore and should not be a barrier be-
tween people and the services they 
need. 
Our focus must be on supporting sur-
vivors and those who use these vital re-
sources. That is why my substitute 
amendment replaces the full text of 
the bill before us with multiple key 
provisions to ensure victims of domes-
tic violence and their dependents re-
ceive critical assistance to help them 
in their time of crisis. 
First, my amendment reauthorizes 
the current Family Violence Preven-
tion and Services Act, FVPSA, for the 
next 5 years, ensuring that victims of 
domestic violence get the lifesaving, 
supportive services they need. 
FVPSA was enacted to save innocent 
lives, not put them in harm’s way. 
That is why my amendment also re-
jects a change included in the Demo-
crats’ proposal that could lead to vio-
lence prevention dollars going to sup-
port abortion services. The amendment 
makes clear that Federal law should 
not support abortions. Upholding the 
sanctity of every human life is of ut-
most importance, and it is critical to 
ensure that no taxpayer dollars pay for 
abortions. 
Next, my amendment also protects 
the ability of faith-based organizations 
to continue helping victims of domes-
tic violence. Countless religious orga-
nizations work tirelessly to help pro-
tect victims of domestic violence, but 
the Democrats’ radical abortion agenda 
risks denying victims’ access to these 
providers. 
Finally, 
my 
amendment 
brings 
much-needed transparency and Federal 
agency accountability to the programs 
authorized under this law. Congress 
should have safeguards in place to en-
sure that these resources are going to 
the people who truly need them and 
not being used to push a hidden agenda 
without the public’s knowledge. 
The Republican substitute is a care-
fully crafted set of reforms that puts 
victims of family violence and the peo-
ple who serve them first. Furthermore, 
it is a pro-life amendment strongly op-
posed by Planned Parenthood. 
I urge my colleagues to reject the 
other side’s bill and instead embrace 
the commonsense, lifesaving provisions 
included in the Republican substitute 
amendment. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I believe I have the right to 
close. I am prepared to close, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, it is 
critical that we reauthorize FVPSA in 
a bipartisan manner, free from partisan 
poison pills. The Democrats’ bill fails 
to do that, but the Republican amend-
ments would set aside politics, ensur-
ing FVPSA continues to offer help to 
victims of domestic violence. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time to close. 
Madam Speaker, again, the amend-
ments included in this en bloc weaken 
the bill. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on en bloc 
No. 2. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WASSERMAN
SCHULTZ). 
Pursuant 
to 
House Resolution 716, the previous 
question is ordered on the amendments 
en bloc offered by the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT).

The story of the 2021 Braves is one of 
resiliency. The team lost two of their 
stars—Ronald Acuna, Jr., and Mike 
Soroka—to injuries early this season. 
Despite these setbacks, the Braves 
persevered 
and 
won 
the 
National 
League’s Eastern Division title for the 
fourth year in a row. 
The Braves have been underdogs in 
each of their playoff series, but thanks 
to big performances by players such as 
Eddie Rosario, whose 14 hits against 
the Dodgers tied the record for the 
most hits in a single series, tonight, 
they will take the field to compete in 
the World Series. 
Many of the players on the Braves’ 
roster honed their skills in Georgia’s 
Seventh 
District, 
playing 
for 
the 
Gwinnett Stripers, the Braves’ Triple- 
A affiliate in Lawrenceville. 
The 2021 Atlanta Braves embody the 
never-quit spirit of the State of Geor-
gia, and I wish them good luck as they 
begin the World Series tonight. 
My family, staff, and people of Sev-
enth District are cheering you on. Go 
Braves.

CALLING 
FOR 
CREATION 
OF 
A 
FORMAL COMMISSION TO INVES-
TIGATE THE TRUE ORIGIN OF 
COVID–19 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
Dr. Fauci has forsaken his Hippocratic 
oath and exchanged it for the mantle of 
unchecked power. His policies shut-
tered the U.S. economy, drove our 
country into financial upheaval, and 
violated the rights of millions of Amer-
icans. 
In July, he willfully lied to the U.S. 
Senate about his role in funding gain- 
of-function research in Wuhan, China. 
This week, the world was shocked to 
discover that through an experiment 
under his watch, sweet beagle puppies 
had their heads stuffed into crates so 
that sand flies could slowly strip away 
the skin from their bones. These de-
fenseless animals were damned to ago-
nize in silence because their vocal 
cords had been surgically ripped from 
their throats so that their tormentors 
could discharge their evil actions with-
out having to hear incessant yapping. 
Madam Speaker, today I am calling 
for the creation of a formal commis-
sion to investigate the true origin of 
COVID–19, the role Fauci played in its 
creation, the false statements he made 
to Members of Congress under oath, 
and why the hell Americans are fund-
ing the torture of puppies in Africa. 
Americans deserve the truth, and 
this demon doctor must never be al-
lowed to escape justice. 
f 
STANDING UP FOR IMMIGRANTS 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of every single TPS hold-
er, DACA recipient, essential worker, 
and farmworker in this country who 
have pleaded for this Congress to act; 
not just today, Madam Speaker, but for 
the last 35 years. 
During the pandemic, our Nation’s 
undocumented immigrants rose to the 
occasion. 
They 
kept 
our 
grocery 
shelves stocked, packing warehouses 
running, and cleaning and sanitizing 
businesses, caring for our families— 
particularly 
our 
seniors, 
Madam 
Speaker—and delivering food right to 
our doorsteps while this country came 
to a standstill—to a halt. 
Our praise and lip service are simply 
not enough. How can we build back 
better without delivering for those who 
delivered for us—literally delivered for 
us—during this pandemic? Building 
back better means providing real re-
form for our undocumented neighbors. 
There are about 5 million undocu-
mented immigrants who risked their 
lives during the worst pandemic in our 
history. They risked their lives each 
and every day, and the countless more 
that kept this country afloat, like our 
more than 30,000 DACA recipients who 
stepped up for us and worked on the 
front lines as physicians, residents, 
nurses, and paramedics. 
Madam Speaker, let’s stand up for 
immigrants. 
f 
BIDEN ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, Democrats are always looking 
for a new way to pick your pocket. 
Their latest scheme, tucked away in 
their reconciliation bill, is a heat your 
home tax just in time for winter. 
This tax would eliminate almost 
90,000 
American 
jobs 
and 
increase 
Americans’ heating bills by up to $242 
per year. Pain from the heat your 
home tax would hit Americans who are 
already suffering from the Biden en-
ergy crisis. 
The national average for a gallon of 
gasoline reached $3.38 on Monday—the 
most Americans have paid since Biden 
was Vice President. And the heating 
home costs are already projected to 
rise as much as 54 percent on some 
homes and households in America. 
This crisis is driven by bad policies. 
On Joe Biden’s first day in office, he 
killed 11,000 American jobs by blocking 
the Keystone pipeline. Basically, Joe 
Biden’s energy policy is this: You kill 
the Keystone pipeline and then you 
allow Russia a green light to build a 
pipeline, and then you beg OPEC to in-
crease production, and you buy solar 
panels from China. 
f 
HONORING AMERICA’S 
IMMIGRANTS 
(Mr. CORREA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, today 
I rise to remind my colleagues of the 
contributions that immigrants have 
made to our country. 
I want to direct your attention to the 
poster next to me. This is Corporal 
Jose Angel Garibay; he is a Dreamer 
who lived in my district and joined the 
U.S. Marine Corps. Jose Angel Garibay 
was the first serviceman from Orange 
County to be killed in action in Iraq. 
Jose Angel Garibay was a Dreamer who 
made the ultimate sacrifice for Amer-
ica. 
Madam Speaker, if I can call your at-
tention to a second poster. This is 
Gregoria, a farmworker who has risked 
her life during the worldwide pandemic 
to feed our country. Even during 
droughts and fire season in California, 
these farmworkers still went to work 
to make sure that our country was fed, 
and 
America 
was 
kept 
healthy. 
Gregoria has been living and working 
in my district for 28 years. She is a 
mother and breadwinner. 
People like these two individuals, 
Gregoria and Jose Angel Garibay, have

ship. Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to continue to fight for a path-
way to citizenship for millions of indi-
viduals like Gregoria and Jose. 
f 
EQUITABLE ACCESS TO 
HEALTHCARE 
(Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Equal Healthcare for 
All Act. Federal law protects against 
discrimination in housing, schooling, 
and employment. 
But equitable access to healthcare 
remains broadly unprotected, the con-
sequences of which are deadly: for 
Black women who are more likely to 
die during childbirth, for Hispanic indi-
viduals who suffer from higher rates of 
chronic diseases, for LGBTQ individ-
uals who postpone medical treatment 
for fear of discrimination. 
For the first time in our Nation’s his-
tory, my bill would make equitable 
healthcare a protected civil right. And 
it will be another important step to-
wards breaking down the barriers of 
discrimination in our country. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Dwayne Hall, a community leader and 
good friend, for his efforts to concep-
tualize and advance this bill. The im-
portance of those efforts cannot be un-
derstated. 
f 
BETTER MANAGEMENT FOR OUR 
FEDERAL FORESTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
just wanted to point out, as a result of 
the over 2 million acres of fire that 
have happened in California, the next 
thing that happens is when the winter 
comes, and the rains come—like we are 
having so much now—the deluge of 
rain caused after the forest fires be-
cause of unmanaged forests the erosion 
that we are seeing here. 
This example here is Highway 70 run-
ning through Butte County and Plumas 
County. The rockslide you see here is 
part of the fire scar. So when we lose 
all that foliage, you get erosion. 
What does erosion mean? Not just 
the highway being closed, but this 
washes into, in this case Feather River, 
on down into Lake Oroville, which is a 
water source for 25 million people in 
California. 
So why is this important? Because 
we have to do a much better job of 
managing our Federal forests, our Fed-
eral lands, and we are not doing that. 
We are not doing it speedily enough be-
cause we have so much to catch up on, 
yet every year millions of acres of for-
est land burn. This is just one of the re-
sults here. 
The lost transportation. The water 
quality that affects so many people is 
going to be negatively affected by this 
lack of action. We need the Forest 
Service to move rapidly towards not 
only mitigating the fires from this 
year with erosion, but also manage 
these lands so we don’t have these hor-
rific fires.

GO ASTROS 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I want everybody to know there is 
breaking news, and you are going to 
see something exciting on the floor of 
the House tomorrow. 
First of all, Go Astros. The big or-
ange is rolling into Atlanta. And I 
know the red, white, and blue is in At-
lanta, called the Braves. But we are 
coming in because there is nothing 
more meteoric than the Astros. 
And breaking news, we will be on the 
floor tomorrow with some exciting 
challenges. Go Astros, all the way to 
the World Series. 
But I don’t mind accepting a chal-
lenge, and tomorrow I think we will 
have some folks from Atlanta and 
Georgia and some folks from Texas and 
Houston on the floor tomorrow with 
some breaking news. Go Astros.

HELP FOR OUR RETURNING 
SERVICEMEN AND SERVICEWOMEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. ZELDIN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous materials on the topic of our 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, our 
servicemen and–women have sacrificed 
so much in their courageous fight for 
our exceptional Nation and our free-
doms. Unfortunately, when our vet-
erans return home from the battlefield, 
too often they find that their fight has 
just begun. 
My home county in New York, Suf-
folk, boasts one of the highest con-
centrations of veterans in the country, 
and we pride ourselves on our rich his-
tory and commitment to serving our 
Nation’s veterans. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
estimates that approximately 20 vet-
erans per day take their own life, of-
tentimes plagued with post-traumatic 
stress disorder and traumatic brain in-
jury. 
One of those suffering was PFC Jo-
seph Dwyer, an Iraq war veteran from 
Mount Sinai, New York. As an Army 
combat medic, PFC Dwyer was the face 
of the Iraq war. In 2003, this photo next 
to me was taken of Joe carrying an in-
jured Iraqi child to safety, and it went 
viral worldwide. 
Unfortunately, when he came back 
home to Long Island he returned with 
the mental wounds of war, and after 
years of struggling, he lost his battle 
with PTSD in 2008. It is important to 
note that Joe didn’t commit suicide. 
He was seeking temporary relief from 
his pain, and his last words were: I 
don’t want to die. 
Understanding that PFC Dwyer was 
just one of the local veterans strug-
gling, I created the PFC Joseph P. 
Dwyer Veteran Peer Support Program 
as a New York State senator in 2012. 
The Dwyer program is modeled as a 
peer-to-peer support program for vet-
erans struggling with PTSD and TBI. 
This model provides a safe, confiden-
tial, and educational platform where 
all veterans are welcome to meet with 
other veterans in support of each oth-
er’s successful transition to post-serv-
ice life and seeks to build vet-to-vet re-
lationships 
that 
enhance 
positive 
change. 
The Dwyer program also incorporates 
a variety of therapeutic activities, 
such as horse training and fishing that 
provide for common experiences, learn-
ing, and personal growth. 
Suffolk County served as one of four 
test counties in New York, and since 
then, with the dedication and hard 
work of so many exceptional men and 
women, the program has successfully 
expanded to more than 25 counties 
across New York, saving lives and as-
sisting tens of thousands of New York 
veterans battling PTSD and TBI. 
The program has been so successful 
that the New York State budget for fis-
cal year 2022 included a 22 percent in-
crease in funding for the Dwyer pro-
gram. The way the program is orga-
nized, by providing grants to localities, 
it has allowed each county to cus-
tomize its individual program to fit in-
dividual needs and resources they have 
available while running an efficient 
and effective program. 
Each county only receives between 
$100,000 and $300,000 from the State, and 
what they manage to do with that 
money is incredible. 
Its continued track record of success 
is why I introduced bipartisan legisla-
tion, H.R. 1476, the PFC Joseph P. 
Dwyer Peer Support Program Act, to 
expand the Dwyer program nationally 
by authorizing the VA Secretary to 
make grants available to State and 
local entities, to carry out peer-to-peer 
mental health programs all across our 
Nation and help ensure that all of our 
Nation’s veterans have access to the 
support they need. 
This 
important 
legislation 
has 
earned the support of 14 veteran advo-
cacy 
organizations, 
including: 
The 
American Legion, Military Veterans 
Advocacy, Blinded Veterans Associa-
tion, Military Order of the Purple

tance of this legislation and improving 
the resources and care we provide to 
our Nation’s heroes as they make the 
difficult transition to civilian life. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. COSTA), 
who is a leader in this effort fighting 
for our veterans and is a cosponsor of 
H.R. 1476. 
b 1615 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of the Pri-
vate First Class Joseph P. Dwyer Peer 
Support Program Act. I want to thank 
my colleague, Representative ZELDIN, 
for his good work and his efforts on be-
half of veterans who serve our country 
with great honor. 
Roughly 15 million adults in the 
United States suffer from post-trau-
matic stress disorder, otherwise known 
as PTSD. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs indicates that between 15 and 30 
percent of Vietnam veterans have had 
post-traumatic stress disorder in their 
lifetime; about 12 percent of Desert 
Storm veterans have had post-trau-
matic stress disorder; and between 11 
and 20 percent of those who served in 
Operations Iraqi Freedom and Endur-
ing Freedom now also, sadly, have been 
subject to post-traumatic stress dis-
order in a given year. 
These statistics are staggering, and, 
sadly, because of PTSD, many veterans 
have taken their lives. Our servicemen 
and -women sacrifice so much to pro-
tect our freedom, and we must do all 
we can to help them recover and pre-
vent these tragic losses. 
In 2013 the State of New York, under 
the 
leadership 
of 
Representative 
ZELDIN
and others, established the 
Dwyer program to support veterans 
suffering from post-traumatic stress 
disorder and traumatic brain injury, 
otherwise referred to as TBI, by con-
necting veterans with other veterans 
who suffer through similar struggles. 
Over the years, the program has cre-
ated a safe, confidential, and edu-
cational network for thousands of vet-
erans to support each other on their 
transition to post-service life; and this 
is so important. 
The Veterans Administration has 
found that one key part to help our 
veterans is to ensure that they feel 
connected to their communities and 
know that they are not alone in their 
struggles that they face and that they 
can come back and become a contrib-
uting member to their community as 
they were when they left. Expanding 
the Dwyer program nationwide, there-
fore, is crucial to save lives and help 
our veterans successfully transition to 
civilian life when they come home. 
The San Joaquin Valley of Cali-
fornia, which I am honored to rep-
resent, is home to nearly 30,000 vet-
erans. Throughout my time in Con-
gress, veterans and their families have 
been one of my top priorities. I have 
spent 17 years working side by side 
with the Veterans Administration as-
sisting veterans with PTSD, creating a 
veterans’ home, expanding veterans’ 
healthcare, and providing a whole host 
of efforts that deal with post-traumatic 
stress disorder and pending claims for 
service-connected benefits. When we 
support them, we also must never for-
get about their families because it is 
both them and their families. 
Next month on November 11 we are 
going to celebrate Veterans Day, and I 
can’t think of a better thing that we 
can all do than to work on this legisla-
tion successfully and say thank you to 
those who have served our Nation. I am 
a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan 
legislation to provide our veterans 
with 
the 
support, 
healthcare, 
and 
treatment they have earned and, there-
fore, that they deserve. This nation-
wide expansion is long overdue. 
I want to congratulate and thank my 
colleagues for their efforts. We can do 
more, and we must do more. Every vet-
eran counts on us to do our part be-
cause they have done theirs. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman COSTA so much for 
his leadership and advocacy. It is so 
important that from coast to coast 
every veteran in the United States of 
America knows that there are people in 
their community who would drop ev-
erything at a moment’s notice in the 
middle of the night to provide that love 
and support to get them through their 
difficult times. Every veteran should 
have access to a program like this, and 
I appreciate the gentleman’s leader-
ship. 
Mr. COSTA. I commend the gen-
tleman and my colleagues on this ef-
fort. It is very important, and it is the 
right thing to do. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, Con-
gressman MIKE GARCIA is another co-
sponsor of H.R. 1476. He was a Navy 
fighter pilot. We are not going to hold 
that against him. We are still just get-
ting close here to an Army-Navy game. 
But what we find is that different 
generations 
serving 
in 
different 
branches 
and 
different 
conflicts, 
whether it is in peacetime or wartime, 
we have so many veterans who have 
stepped up. Congressman MIKE GARCIA 
sure has done his part. It is an honor to 
serve with him now here in the House. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. GARCIA), 
who is a cosponsor of H.R. 1476. 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I look forward to maybe more 
contested Army-Navy games in the 
near term. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
in 
our 
battle 
against our internal demons, there is 
nothing more powerful than veterans 
helping other veterans. I rise today to 
discuss the need to support our vet-
erans battling post-traumatic stress 
disorder and traumatic brain injury, 
otherwise known as TBI. Prior to com-
ing to Congress I served in the U.S. 
Navy as an F/A–18 strike fighter pilot. 
I served from the age of 18 until the age 
of 36. I was honored to fly combat mis-
sions during the first 6 months of Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom over the skies of 
Baghdad, Fallujah and Tikrit in 2001 in 
support of our soldiers and marines on 
the ground. 
As a veteran myself, I understand 
that individuals serving in the military 
or those who have served often take 
pride in their ability to compartmen-
talize things or to compartmentalize 
events in their minds. This is how we 
cope. But during my journey I lost too 
many friends, and many of them to sui-
cide, because they thought they were 
able to compartmentalize when in re-
ality they needed the help. 
When someone makes a decision to 
leave the military, they often think 
that by going back to the real world 
they will lose their experiences and 
that the memories that terrorize many 
of us will come off with the uniform. 
This simply could not be further from 
the truth. The memories are always 
there weighing on you mentally, phys-
ically, and emotionally. This is why it 
is crucial that we raise awareness for 
those dealing with PTSD or TBI. 
The mental toughness taught in the 
military does not mean staying silent 
or not reaching out for help. Instead, I 
believe that receiving help and talking 
with a professional or a fellow veteran 
shows resilience. It shows you are long-
ing to heal, Madam Speaker, so you 
can be a better spouse and you can be 
a better parent and a better friend. 
That is what real toughness looks like. 
It is abundantly clear that there is a 
dire need to improve access to the crit-
ical mental health resources for our 
veterans battling PTSD and TBI. This 
is what H.R. 1476 does. And I commend 
Representative ZELDIN for introducing 
the bipartisan bill, the PFC Joseph P. 
Dwyer Peer Support Program Act, 
which would establish a peer-to-peer 
support program for military veterans 
suffering from PTSD and TBI. 
Private First Class Joseph P. Dwyer, 
an Iraq war veteran, is just one exam-
ple of a life taken too soon because of 
PTSD acquired during his time of serv-
ice. There is a bond amongst those who 
have served that cannot be broken, and 
this program will create efforts that 
take into account this bond and this 
friendship and this kinship, and it pro-
vides a way for veterans to heal along-
side one another. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly support 
this legislation and encourage others 
to do the same. Our precious warriors 
deserve our support. Our precious war-
riors and their families need our sup-
port. 
God bless all those who serve. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman just said something that

October 26, 2021 
really struck with me as he reflects on 
people he served with who lost their 
lives due to PTSD. 
I have actually known more people in 
the military who have lost their lives 
due to PTSD than have lost their lives 
in combat. When we were deciding 
whether or not to create a program 
like this and we created a veterans’ ad-
visory panel to design the proposal, one 
of the members was someone named 
John Jennings. Right before we had our 
first meeting, John lost his battle due 
to PTSD, and we named it the John P. 
Jennings Veterans’ Advisory Panel. 
But these stories for many post-9/11 
veterans—and it was called something 
else in decades and generations past, it 
seems like each time there has been a 
conflict it has had a different name—so 
many veterans have been impacted ac-
tually losing more friends due to PTSD 
than in combat. 
My colleague from New York, CHRIS 
JACOBS, who is a cosponsor of H.R. 1476, 
comes from a part of the State that I 
actually had just visited. They have 
successful Dwyer models now in his re-
gion, too. Veterans of all generations 
and 
proud 
veteran 
supporters 
all 
throughout CHRIS JACOBS’ district are 
looking to find ways to tell the story of 
how the Dwyer program is working for 
them and in other areas looking for 
ways to expand it to go further. Every 
minute since he has been here, CHRIS 
JACOBS has been an outstanding leader 
for our veterans and our veteran com-
munity. Of course, he is cosponsoring 
this legislation because he doesn’t 
waste any opportunity to do every-
thing in his power to help fight for 
vets. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JACOBS). 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his 
service and sacrifice to our country. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port, as well, of H.R. 1476 to allocate 
more resources to our American heroes 
struggling with post-traumatic stress 
disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain 
injury. 
Madam Speaker, as we become more 
aware of mental health, we must en-
sure that we make every possible effort 
to help those who served our Nation 
and are now struggling. It is estimated 
that 11 to 20 percent of veterans suffer 
from PTSD, and almost 500,000 vet-
erans have suffered a TBI in the past 20 
years. 
These injuries were incurred pro-
tecting our Nation and defending our 
freedom across numerous wars. Cer-
tainly this conversation surrounding 
mental health has gained a new na-
tional spotlight in the past number of 
months as veterans witnessed the cha-
otic and reckless withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. My office has received nu-
merous calls from veterans in my dis-
trict who are deeply disturbed by the 
events we have witnessed, and many 
are experiencing new grief and pain. 
Similarly, it was reported that the 
veterans crisis hotline saw a recent 
surge in both texts and calls from vet-
erans struggling with mental health 
around the Nation. 
There is no greater honor or act of 
selflessness than to sign up to serve 
our Nation in our military. We have a 
moral and sworn obligation to protect 
those who sacrificed protecting us, and 
we have an obligation to ensure any 
veteran can access the resources they 
need. 
I proudly cosponsored the PFC Jo-
seph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program 
Act as one solution to this complex 
problem. I would say I knew full well 
how well this program operated as a 
member of the State senate trying to 
carry on the great work and the cre-
ation of Congressman ZELDIN when he 
was in the State senate. I want to 
thank him for his leadership on this 
issue and carrying this forward to the 
Federal level so more areas can benefit 
from it. 
Supporting our veterans is a bipar-
tisan issue we can all get behind. There 
is no room to debate this issue, only 
room for action to help our American 
heroes. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in cosponsoring H.R. 
1476, and I urge this body to move effi-
ciently to provide more mental health 
and brain injury resources to hundreds 
of thousands of veterans across the Na-
tion who desperately need it. I am 
grateful for this opportunity. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, Con-
gressman JACOBS, as he mentioned, was 
a member of the New York State Sen-
ate, and every single year it was a 
budget battle to get this money in that 
final budget. Thanks to Chris’ efforts 
working on both sides of the aisle in 
both the New York State Senate and 
New York State Assembly, it didn’t 
just continue to get funded but it ex-
panded, and it is now in his region very 
successfully. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for being here and for his co-
sponsorship. 
Congressman 
MADISON
CAWTHORN 
with North Carolina’s 11th District is a 
member of the House Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee. He is a cosponsor of H.R. 
1476. He is all in on that committee to 
fight for our veterans to make sure 
that the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs is being run as effectively and ef-
ficiently as possible and there are a 
whole lot of Americans all across this 
country who know that as MADISON 
CAWTHORN has their back as a member 
of this committee. We are all proud of 
him and glad he is here in the House 
with us. We are honored to have him as 
a cosponsor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding to 
me. 
I will say that I am proud to be a co-
sponsor on his bill. I think it is far past 
time that Congress start taking the 
mental health requirements, neces-
sities, and needs of our veterans’ com-
munity more seriously. Not only does 
this mean just sending more money to 
it, it means thinking outside of the 
box; and I think that is exactly what 
the gentleman’s bill does. 
I will tell you, Madam Speaker, when 
we start thinking about the debt that 
our Nation owes to this Nation’s vet-
erans, we realize that the debt can 
never truly be repaid. But certainly we 
can make sure that not 23 servicemem-
bers—veterans—are 
committing 
sui-
cide every single day. Certainly we can 
make sure that the telehealth program 
within the VA is expanded so that peo-
ple can have easy mental checkups 
that won’t deem them as someone who 
is mentally unfit. 
b 1630 
Certainly, this means that we can 
take a proactive manner in making 
sure that our veterans feel safe and feel 
as if they can come forward and speak 
about the mental health issues that 
they are facing. 
So many servicemembers are dying. I 
believe the gentleman from New York 
remarked earlier that one of our mem-
bers of this committee said that they 
actually knew more people who had 
committed 
suicide 
since 
returning 
home from the battlefield than had ac-
tually died on the battlefield, and that 
is truly heartbreaking. 
When they come home to America, 
they should be greeted as our Nation’s 
heroes because that is exactly what 
they are. 
It is my honor to cosponsor this bill. 
It is my honor to support the mental 
health needs of our veteran commu-
nity. And it is my honor to fight for 
them every single day. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for his leadership. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman CAWTHORN, and I 
am not surprised that he is a cosponsor 
of this bill. He very eloquently stated 
the need to think outside the box. 
People go for help, and there are 
some people who just always thought, 
Congressman RUTHERFORD, that the an-
swer is just to provide a medication. 
They weren’t thinking outside the box. 
I remember people were showing up 
sick to PT. They would go to the infir-
mary complaining, and they were diag-
nosing Tylenol and codeine. You have a 
headache, Tylenol and codeine. You 
need knee surgery? Well, here is Ty-
lenol and codeine. Whatever it was, it 
was just all over the base. It was the 
instinctive response. 
I think, for a while, the Department 
of Veterans Affairs thought that that 
was the only answer. 
We have a county sheriff who, in 
many ways, I look to him as the sheriff 
here in the House. He is also a cospon-
sor of H.R. 1476. He is someone who 
knows his purpose here in the House, a 
principled man, a fighter. His constitu-
ents are very lucky to have him in 
Florida’s Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict. And he gets it.

That is why he has been all in fight-
ing for veterans every day that he has 
been here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. RUTHER-
FORD). 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. I thank my good 
friend from New York for his kind 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss something that affects far too 
many of our veterans around the coun-
try. Every year in America, thousands 
of young men and women, they raise 
their right hands and take that oath to 
support and defend the Constitution of 
the United States against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. 
They take this oath with the full 
knowledge of the risks associated with 
military service. They may be shipped 
off to a dangerous place. They may be 
required to have courage under fire. 
And like scores of American heroes 
who have paid the ultimate sacrifice 
throughout our history, they may even 
lay down their lives as well. 
Madam Speaker, what these men and 
women did not sign up for is the tor-
ment that follows too many after their 
service is complete. In fact, for some, 
the toughest battle that they will face 
comes after they leave the military. 
Over the last 2 years, Americans have 
weathered the COVID–19 pandemic. But 
I tell you, there is another pandemic 
raging in our veteran community. 
Every single day, over 20 veterans take 
their lives—every single day. 
Since 9/11, we have lost four times as 
many veterans and Active Duty serv-
icemembers to suicide than we have to 
combat—four times more to suicide 
than combat. This pandemic may not 
get the front-page attention in the 
media, but for those battling PTSD, 
TBI, and other forms of service-con-
nected trauma, it is personal, and it is 
real. 
We owe not only a debt of gratitude 
to those who have served but also a 
commitment that we are there for 
them throughout their lives. That is 
why I am proud to support the PFC Jo-
seph P. Dwyer Peer Support Program 
Act because I know it works. 
This bipartisan legislation expands 
an already proven, successful peer-to- 
peer support program for veterans suf-
fering from PTSD and TBI. This pro-
gram, as I said, has already been prov-
en to be effective therapy across the 
State of New York. It is time to bring 
this to veterans in every corner of the 
United States to save those lives. 
I want to thank my good friend, Con-
gressman LEE ZELDIN, for filing this 
bill, this very important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this bill and con-
tinue to fight for those who have so 
bravely fought for us. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, here, 
in the Halls of Congress, you hear mil-
lions, billions, trillions get thrown 
around, big dollar numbers. What has 
been so amazing is that a county gets 
$180,000, saving countless lives, seeing 
families staying together, people being 
able to stay in their jobs, and commu-
nities are stronger. 
It is so efficient, and that, I think, is 
one of the keys of success because 
there are people in our communities 
who want to volunteer their special-
ties. There is a social worker, psychol-
ogist, psychiatrist. There is someone 
who wants to provide food to that bar-
becue, a venue for a meeting. They 
want to give back. 
There are a lot of people I come 
across all the time who say that their 
only regret in life is that they never 
served. They wanted to serve and 
didn’t do it, and that is their biggest 
regret in life. They are finding ways to 
serve. 
The gentleman is stepping up in a 
huge way, and it is something that I 
would be excited to see in his congres-
sional district in Florida. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. I would, too. I 
will tell the gentleman, listening to 
him speak, it reminds me that this is 
not even just about those servicemem-
bers. We talk about the 20 to 23 number 
that take their lives every day. But 
there are thousands of family members 
and friends who are affected by those 
deaths. So this is not only for our serv-
icemembers. It is also for all of their 
families and friends and loved ones. I 
thank the gentleman for this bill. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I have 
seen that, too. There is a spouse out 
there who is seeing their loved one 
struggling with post-traumatic stress, 
and they don’t know what to do to 
help. They are reaching out to the 
local veterans service office. They are 
reaching out to their local Dwyer pro-
gram because they want to help their 
loved one. They want to keep their 
marriage together. They don’t want ev-
erything to fall apart. 
The specialty, the expertise here, is 
not just about providing that support 
and help to the servicemember. When 
one person serves in the military, just 
like you were a sheriff, when one per-
son serves in law enforcement, the 
whole family serves. You come home 
with the mental wounds of war, and 
really, in a way, the whole family is ex-
periencing the mental wounds of war. 
Mr. RUTHERFORD. I will tell the 
gentleman, it is proven in New York. It 
is actually proven in northeast Florida. 
We have a peer-to-peer program that is 
called Fire Watch, which has been in-
credibly successful just recently. 
That is why I was excited to see this 
bill because I know from Fire Watch, 
and I know from the results that you 
all have had in the great State of New 
York, just how important this is to 
saving lives. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I re-
member when I first got here to the 
House, and there was somebody with a 
national veterans service office who 
was advocating for peer-to-peer sup-
port. I asked this national commander 
what he had in mind, what he envi-
sioned, what his model was for how to 
provide peer-to-peer support. 
I wasn’t trying to ask it as some type 
of a trick question, a gotcha question, 
but I realized, in his answer, he didn’t 
really know. He knew that he was sup-
posed to advocate for peer-to-peer sup-
port, but he didn’t know exactly what 
that model was going to look like. 
Then, over the course of these last 
few years, more of these national vet-
erans service organizations have been 
looking at what is going on in New 
York. Now they come to the Halls of 
Congress and are testifying in front of 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee. They 
talk about peer support, and they spe-
cifically are citing the Dwyer program 
as that model. 
I saw, at a place called the Warrior 
Ranch in Suffolk County, a veteran 
who is struggling with post-traumatic 
stress disorder be placed in this area 
with a wild horse that was just rescued. 
He had never interacted with horses be-
fore. Within minutes—he had some 
training as to how to understand what 
the horse is thinking, how to take 
charge, realizing that the horse is 
going to be testing you out a little bit 
as to who is in charge. He took charge 
of that situation, and he immediately 
developed this bond with this horse. 
I was speaking to someone who bare-
ly survived his own struggle with post- 
traumatic stress. He is upstate New 
York. Through a similar program, he 
developed a bond with a horse, and it 
was so strong that the owner of this 
ranch would allow him to come in the 
middle of the night if he was having a 
bad night and spend some time with 
this horse. That was how he got 
through his tough time. 
I mean, he is healthy. He is doing 
great. He is a leader in his community, 
with the veterans community specifi-
cally. And he credits that interaction 
he had with a horse. 
Others, it is fly-fishing. Others, it is 
having access to a companion animal. 
The answer is not just to medicate a 
person with mental health issues. You 
need to find other alternative ways to 
try to assist these men and women in 
need. 
It is not just veterans, although here 
we are specifically talking about vet-
erans with the mental wounds of war. 
A lot of the examples that could be 
provided of success with the Dwyer 
program can be replicated for others 
who are nonveterans who have mental 
health challenges in this country. 
The Dwyer program has made a life-
saving impact in our State. I have re-
ceived a few testimonials. 
Danielle is an Army veteran enrolled 
in the Suffolk County Dwyer program. 
She stated: 
I started the Dwyer program back in April 
2020 because the internship program I was in 
was no longer an option during COVID–19. I 
was a single mother who was furloughed and 
attempting graduate school through virtual 
means, which was extremely taxing on my 
mental health. 
The support group grew into a sisterhood 
of not only emotional and spiritual support 
but guidance and education on the resources 
available to us and that female veterans

must continue to fight for their needs as a 
special population. 
I owe everything to this magnetic group 
for being the positive guidance I needed to 
continue my service, complete my edu-
cational goals, and become employed at an 
agency that truly cares about veterans’ spe-
cial needs. 
In Suffolk, that program is led by 
Thomas Ronayne and Marcelle Leis 
and a number of others. They are all 
in. They have dedicated their lives to-
ward making it a huge success. They 
certainly impacted Danielle’s life. 
They also impacted Robert’s life. He 
is a Navy veteran and a Suffolk County 
Dwyer program participant who said: 
I was struggling with both substance abuse 
and use and thoughts of self-harm, as well as 
a suicide attempt. 
This program, and those involved, helped 
me battle all this, and I now have over 5 
years sober, a family, two degrees, and a new 
career. 
Roger is a Marine Corps veteran, a 
Purple Heart recipient, and a Suffolk 
County Dwyer program participant. He 
said: 
You have to be mentally ready to say to 
yourself, I need something. I need to reach 
out to somebody somewhere, because even 
though it takes a tremendous amount of 
courage and dedication to join the military, 
it takes just as much courage and dedication 
to be able to express that you have an issue 
with your life because of your experiences 
through the military. I am really happy for 
the Dwyer program because it gives us the 
outlet we need, because veterans only relate 
to other veterans. 
Judy is from Suffolk County. She 
said: 
I am a psychiatric RN with 33 years clin-
ical experience. During that time, I have 
treated veterans with PTSD and traumatic 
brain injury. As these issues are long term, 
the problem has always been providing sup-
port after hospitalization. There have been 
no resources in the community until Dwyer 
came along. 
Now there is a strong helping hand to sup-
port these heroes. But it needs to be ex-
panded to accomplish more. Without it, vet-
erans face repeated hospitalizations, result-
ing in premature and unnecessary deaths. 
Arthur is a Vietnam veteran from 
Suffolk County. He said: 
As a combat vet of the Vietnam war, I can 
relate to the need for the Dwyer program. 
When I returned home from Vietnam, there 
were no support services that I was aware of. 
I went from my duty station in Vietnam to 
CONUS in 3 days, no adjustment. 
I am not alone, as there are many Vietnam 
vets that are suffering even today. I believe 
that not adjusting to civilian life sets back 
an individual’s progress and assimilation 
back into society. 
b 1645 
I will give you one last testimonial, 
and I would like to be able to introduce 
my friend, BUDDY CARTER from Geor-
gia. 
Anthony is a Suffolk County Dwyer 
program participant. He said: I have 
personally seen how veterans, myself 
being a disabled veteran included, show 
up to a meeting, and they are provided 
with food, drinks, and a safe and secure 
environment to share veteran-related 
issues with other veterans and receive 
positive, supportive feedback that sig-
nificantly improves their quality of 
life. I am happy to support this pro-
gram and be involved in any way pos-
sible. 
Congressman BUDDY
CARTER
and I 
were elected in 2014. He is a friend. He 
is a great public servant. He has a 
number of specialties that bring diver-
sity here to our Chamber. A number of 
times, based off of his civilian experi-
ences in life, he has made letters, re-
quests, and legislation all better and 
stronger when he has weighed in. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), 
who is my friend and a cosponsor of 
H.R. 1476. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, this afternoon, I am pleased 
to join many of my colleagues to dis-
cuss the crucial need to improve access 
to critical mental health resources for 
veterans battling post-traumatic stress 
disorder, PTSD, and traumatic brain 
injury, TBI. 
Georgia’s First Congressional Dis-
trict, which I have the honor and privi-
lege of representing, has a strong pres-
ence from each branch of the military, 
with 61,000 Active Duty servicemem-
bers. 
We are home to four major military 
bases: Fort Stewart, Hunter Army Air-
field, Kings Bay Naval Submarine 
Base, and Moody Air Force Base. 
My district is also home to over 
50,000 veterans. Approximately 19,000 of 
these veterans are post-9/11 veterans, 
14,000 are Gulf war veterans, 15,000 are 
Vietnam war veterans, 1,800 are Korean 
war veterans, and nearly 200 are World 
War II veterans. 
Suicide is a major issue, not just 
within Georgia’s First District, but one 
across our entire Nation as well. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
reports that an estimated 20 veterans a 
day commit suicide. Madam Speaker, 
that is totally unacceptable. Twenty 
servicemembers, 20 veterans a day 
committing suicide. It is a sad thought 
that 20 of our veterans and service-
members are taking their own lives 
after returning home. 
Even worse, a recent study released 
this past summer by the Costs of War 
Project found that servicemembers and 
veterans are four times more likely to 
have committed suicide than those who 
lost their lives in combat. This is an 
epidemic. 
We are losing more veterans on our 
home front than we have fighting the 
global war on terrorism. It affects not 
only the veterans suffering from men-
tal stress but their families, friends, 
and loved ones they leave behind. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
estimates that 11 to 20 percent of vet-
erans who deployed in support of Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom and Operation En-
during Freedom will have PTSD in a 
given year, compared to veterans of 
Desert Storm and Vietnam, who will 
suffer from PTSD at a rate of 12 and 30 
percent, respectively. 
As many as 23 percent of combat vet-
erans who have returned home from 
Iraq and Afghanistan have come back 
with a traumatic brain injury. The rea-
son why these statistics are so alarm-
ing is the increased risk factors vet-
erans with PTSD and TBI have for 
committing suicide. 
Veterans who suffer from PTSD are 
four times more likely to commit sui-
cide 
than 
those 
veterans 
without 
PTSD, while veterans with a TBI are 
twice as likely to commit suicide than 
those without one. 
That is why I stand here today with 
my colleagues and pledge we work to-
gether in passing crucial legislation 
needed to improve access to critical 
mental health resources for our vet-
erans. 
One critical piece of legislation that 
I was proud to cosponsor is H.R. 1476, 
the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Support 
Program Act, which has been offered 
by my friend and colleague, Represent-
ative LEE Zeldin. This bill will expand 
veteran peer-to-peer support programs 
nationally and help veterans suffering 
from PTSD and TBI. It is imperative 
that veterans receive the care they 
need and to prevent this ongoing crisis. 
Over 60 percent of the veterans that 
died by suicide in 2018 did not visit the 
VA in the year of their death or the 
previous year. Again, over 60 percent of 
the veterans that died by suicide in 
2018 did not visit the VA in the year of 
their death or the previous year. 
While the VA offers different types of 
treatment for veterans who are bat-
tling with PTSD and TBI, we need to 
ensure that veterans are aware of the 
programs available to them and remind 
them that they are not alone. 
That is also why earlier this month I 
cosigned a letter led by my friend Rep-
resentative DAVID JOYCE to Secretary 
McDonough. This letter urged the VA 
to develop a comprehensive plan to 
connect veterans of the war in Afghani-
stan and the global war on terrorism to 
essential VA benefits and services as 
soon as possible. 
As I mentioned, Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District is home to a large 
military and veteran community. We 
have several veteran nonprofit organi-
zations who focus on providing peer-to- 
peer support for veterans who suffer 
from PTSD. 
The PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Peer Sup-
port Program Act will ensure that all 
veterans have access to a safe and con-
fidential 
peer-to-peer 
platform. 
I 
wholeheartedly believe this will help 
lower the number of veterans who com-
mit suicide in our country each day. 
One death is too many. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from New York for organizing this 
today. His efforts are appreciated, they 
are recognized, and we thank him for 
that. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman BUDDY CARTER of 
Georgia for being here and for cospon-
soring this bipartisan bill. There are a 
lot of people on both sides of the aisle 
who have signed on, on this effort. 
Congressman CARTER has the exper-
tise to understand what has been a

longtime, 
conventional 
treatment, 
where doctors would just be prescribing 
a medication. The value of thinking 
outside the box has just saved so many 
lives. To be able to bring this program 
to Georgia, to Florida, to California, 
all across our entire Nation, would be 
enormous. 
I want to thank all my colleagues 
who joined me here today in sharing 
stories of veterans they represent or 
served with during their time in the 
military, and some of their own experi-
ences. I look forward to continuing to 
work with each of them to expand and 
improve access to lifesaving mental 
health resources for our veterans suf-
fering from PTSD and TBI. 
We are less than 2 months removed 
from the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 
terror attacks and less than 3 months 
since the withdrawal of Afghanistan. 
The tragic events that unfolded in Af-
ghanistan were hard for Americans to 
watch, including many Afghanistan 
vets who are speaking out. 
What was interesting to note, and 
not surprising for many, as we are hav-
ing our individual conversations, espe-
cially with the Afghan vets, the calls 
rose to the Veterans Crisis Line, online 
chats with the crisis line staff were up 
almost 40 percent, and texts to the cri-
sis line rose by 98 percent. 
For me, my life could be separated 
into two parts. I am 41 years old. Half 
of my life was before September 11, 
2001; half of my life was after Sep-
tember 11, 2001. But what is so amazing 
about those who are currently serving, 
so many of them, and those who are 
contacting our offices looking for con-
gressional nominations to go to a serv-
ice academy, all they know is life post- 
September 11, 2001. They either weren’t 
born yet or they are just too young to 
remember. 
Everyone who is here in this Cham-
ber now, every one of us probably viv-
idly remembers exactly where we were 
on September 11, 2001. For these people 
who are signing up right now, to think 
that their whole life is everything we 
have seen post-9/11 and they still raise 
their hand and answer the call. We 
have a duty to look out for them, in 
some way to try to give back, because 
they are willing to give it all up in de-
fense of us. 
I want to thank all 14 of the veteran 
service organizations who have stepped 
up, the national commanders who come 
here to the Halls of Congress to talk 
about the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer pro-
gram. 
If you go back and look at the Amer-
ican Legion National Commander’s tes-
timony earlier this year in front of the 
House and Senate VA committees, he 
was advocating for the Dwyer program 
to be expanded nationally. 
It is our duty to give back, to look 
out for our vets and our veteran fami-
lies. PFC Joseph P. Dwyer left behind a 
young widow, a 2-year-old daughter, a 
proud family, and forever they should 
know that this country will never for-
get Joseph Dwyer’s service and sac-
rifice. We are trying to turn it into as 
much of a positive as possible. 
For anyone who is out there, any vet-
eran in need, there is the Veterans Cri-
sis Line to call and there are online 
chats. There are ways to reach out in 
your local community and nationally. 
Please reach out to your local Depart-
ment of VA, at the very least, if you 
don’t know of any other opportunities 
or resources available in your commu-
nity. 
There are people who live around the 
block from you who will drop every-
thing in the middle of the night to help 
you, as I mentioned earlier. Don’t give 
up. We have your back. We are so 
grateful for your service to our coun-
try. This is a great world, a great coun-
try that is worth fighting to protect 
and defend, and a life worth living. 
Madam Speaker, I thank all of the 
cosponsors, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss the need to improve access to crit-
ical mental health resources for veterans bat-
tling with Post-Traumatic Stress and TBI, and 
to pledge my continued support on these vital 
issues facing our countless brave and heroic 
men and women who have dedicated their 
lives to serving our nation. It is imperative that 
we as a country and the United States Con-
gress continue to work with our partners in 
government, industry, academia, and with pri-
vate citizens to provide the best possible tools 
needed for their mental health and well-being. 
TBI is a serious and complex injury that 
happens on and off the battlefield. In fact, 
most TBl’s occur during training. While many 
injuries appear to be psychological, many of 
them are physical and are caused by actual 
damage to the brain because of blast expo-
sure, heavy weaponry, or just doing the day- 
to-day job of a service member. 
I stand firmly behind my colleague, Rep-
resentative LEE ZELDIN, as a partner in his ef-
forts and a cosponsor of H.R. 1476, the PFC 
Joseph Dwyer Peer Support Program Act—a 
wonderful tool for our military that provides 
grants for peer-to-peer mental health support 
authorized by the Secretary of Veterans Af-
fairs. I will continue to support efforts like this 
and other measures to improve the safety, re-
search, and well-being of those who volunteer 
to keep our nation safe. 
The timing of this cannot be more critical. 
We know that following the debacle in Afghan-
istan, we have seen a significant increase of 
veterans calling the suicide hotlines and, very 
unfortunately, we’ve seen an increase in sui-
cides. Many veterans are questioning the 
value of their service in Afghanistan, and hurt-
ing knowing that friends and colleagues died 
for what General Millie has called a strategic 
failure. I share in that pain frankly. I encourage 
anyone struggling with this to reach out and 
get help. You are not alone. But also know, 
that your service was worth it. We stopped ter-
rorism for 20 years coming out of Afghanistan 
and protected the homeland. We killed or cap-
tured the terrorists that masterminded 9/11. I 
think the decisions by President Biden were 
wrong in the failed withdrawal from Afghani-
stan, but our country will learn from its mis-
takes and we will rebound. We always do be-
cause we are a free country. I encourage my 
fellow veterans to keep the faith . . . in our 
God and country. 
I urge my colleagues from both sides of the 
aisle to work together and ensure we do all 
we can to serve and support our men and 
women in uniform by keeping their physical 
brain health and mental health a priority.

HONORING RICHARD TRUMKA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I come before you with many 
wonderful colleagues to honor the life 
and legacy of Richard L. Trumka. Rich 
was a passionate and steadfast leader 
who committed himself to bettering 
the lives of working men and women in 
every nook and cranny of this country. 
Like many made-in-America stories, 
Richard Trumka’s had humble begin-
nings. He grew up in southwest Penn-
sylvania’s coal country, the son and 
grandson of coal miners. He worked the 
mines himself, and he was able to go to 
college and then to law school. His tal-
ent and his charisma were hard to 
miss, which I guess helps explain how 
he came to lead one of our great and 
historic unions, the United Mine Work-
ers of America, at a very young age. 
As President of the United Mine 
Workers, Rich led the iconic Pittston 
Coal strike, a difficult but ultimately 
successful effort to fight off cuts to 
healthcare benefits of workers and 
their families. As a young activist, this 
labor struggle made a huge impression 
on me. 
I knew Rich Trumka for over a quar-
ter of a century, and I enjoyed working 
with him in numerous capacities. In 
1995, I had the honor of running the 
field operation of his historic campaign 
to become secretary-treasurer of the 
AFL–CIO, along with president John 
Sweeney and executive vice president 
Linda Chavez-Thompson. Their victory 
was historic because it represented the 
only insurgent takeover of the AFL– 
CIO leadership since the American Fed-
eration of Labor and the Congress of 
Industrial Organizations joined to cre-
ate the AFL–CIO in 1955. That remains 
true to this day, 66 years later. Rich 
brought earthiness and oratory to the 
ticket, 
complementing 
the 
widely 
loved but more taciturn president John 
Sweeney from SEIU. 
A mine worker from western Penn-
sylvania, a service worker from New 
York City, and a public sector cham-
pion in Linda Chavez-Thompson from 
Texas, they made a perfect combina-
tion and they brought big change to 
the labor movement in many ways. 
For the next 11 years, I served as as-
sistant director of organizing at the 
AFL–CIO, working closely with Rich 
and seeing his drive through innumer-
able organizing legislative and polit-
ical campaigns throughout the Nation. 
The picture next to me represents 
one such effort and one such oppor-
tunity for me to help Rich and the 
other officers carry out their missions.

In their campaign to take over the 
AFL–CIO, they said that they were 
going to get young people involved in 
the labor movement in unprecedented 
ways. And so we created something 
called Union Summer, and they told 
me without a whole lot of notice that 
I had to put it together and lead it. 
In fact, we recruited young people 
from across the Nation, had over 3,500 
applicants, and put 1,000 young people, 
which 
was 
the 
commitment 
they 
made—and 
they 
fulfilled 
it—1,000 
young people on union organizing and 
bargaining campaigns throughout this 
Nation, and they were incredibly di-
verse. Something like two-thirds were 
women, and over half were people of 
color. 
This picture comes from the launch 
of the Union Summer campaign, and 
after Union Summer was over, the offi-
cers gave me a little framed copy of 
this picture, and Rich Trumka’s com-
ments were classic Trumka. He said, 
‘‘Levin, you did a good—no, an out-
standing job on this effort. But thank 
God those kids of yours look like 
Mary.’’ That was Rich Trumka. I still 
remember it. 
It is no secret that Rich was elected 
to be president of the AFL–CIO in 2009 
at a difficult moment for the labor 
movement. Due to a confluence of 
many different factors, working men 
and women faced a string of complex 
challenges. Becoming the head of the 
AFL–CIO was no easy task, but Rich 
was not one to pass up critical fights. 
Instead, he was able to rely on his 
character and conviction and his rela-
tionships to forge a path of consensus 
and solidarity among the 57 unions rep-
resenting 12.5 million members of the 
AFL–CIO. 
Regardless of whether he was talking 
with workers on a factory floor or to 
the President of the United States in 
rooms of the White House few people 
ever see, even on TV, Rich was ground-
ed in his pursuit to improve the mate-
rial life of all working people and their 
families. The AFL–CIO was truly made 
better through his many contributions 
and his strong leadership. 
Coming to Congress and working 
with Mr. Trumka as president of the 
AFL–CIO was a real highlight for me. I, 
and all who knew him, will miss him 
dearly. 
I am grateful to my colleagues for 
being with me here tonight to pay trib-
ute to Rich and to his remarkable life. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the 
chairman of the House Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Michigan for his hard work on the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee and for 
his strong support for working men and 
women in Michigan and across the 
country. 
I rise today in honor of Richard 
Trumka, the late AFL–CIO president 
and one of the Nation’s fiercest and 
most effective champions for workers 
and their families. 
As a former coal miner and leader of 
the storied United Mine Workers of 
America, Richard Trumka deeply un-
derstood the power of the labor move-
ment and the importance of defending 
workers’ rights to organize. His com-
mitment to improving the lives of 
workers and their families never waned 
and has inspired countless people from 
all walks of life. 
To honor Mr. Trumka’s legacy, I re-
main committed to championing legis-
lation 
that 
supports 
hardworking 
Americans 
and 
strengthening 
their 
rights in the workplace. To that end, 
the House has twice passed the Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act. 
Our Nation’s labor unions are critical 
to rebuilding the middle class in Amer-
ica, but decades of antiunion attacks 
have eroded workers’ basic rights to or-
ganize and negotiate for better wages, 
benefits, and working conditions. 
Among other things, this legislation 
would ensure effective sanctions for 
those who violate the law by retali-
ating against those who exercise their 
legal rights; and require workers whose 
rights have been violated to be tempo-
rarily reinstated while their cases are 
pending. The bill would lift restrictions 
on workers’ First Amendment rights to 
engage in boycotts and strikes; and en-
sure workers can win a first contract, 
if they vote to support a union. 
It is a fitting tribute that the PRO 
Act will be named after him. The next 
most important step to honor his leg-
acy is for the Senate to pass this his-
toric legislation. I look forward to the 
day when the Richard L. Trumka Pro-
tecting the Right to Organize Act is 
signed into law. 
But we also have an opportunity to 
strengthen and protect our workforce 
through the Build Back Better plan. 
Notably, the Committee on Education 
and Labor’s section of the plan will in-
crease enforcement of labor law and 
civil rights violations and set meaning-
ful civil monetary penalties for viola-
tions of wage and hour, worker safety, 
and labor laws. 
The plan also includes a major in-
vestment in proven workforce develop-
ment programs to ensure that Ameri-
cans can access the training they need 
to find a rewarding career and earn fair 
wages. 
These historic provisions advance 
Mr. Trumka’s vision: to ensure that all 
workers have a good job and the power 
to determine their wages and working 
conditions. 
Even up to his final days, Mr. 
Trumka was fulfilling that mission, 
rallying workers across the country 
and demonstrating the spirit and soli-
darity that defined his tenure as presi-
dent of the AFL–CIO. 
I hope my colleagues in the House 
and the Senate will join me in hon-
oring Mr. Trumka’s legacy by passing 
both the Richard L. Trumka PRO Act 
and the Build Back Better Act. I thank 
the gentleman from Michigan for his 
hard work and dedication. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. SCOTT. That is 
really amazing, the idea that the PRO 
Act would be named for Rich Trumka. 
It is so fitting. It is really moving to 
me, as somebody who worked for him 
for so long. 
I now yield to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the chair-
woman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee of the House of Representatives. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
LEVIN, for yielding and for organizing 
this tribute this evening. I also thank 
Congressman BOBBY
SCOTT
for the 
honor that we are looking to bestow on 
Rich Trumka. 
Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to 
honor Rich Trumka. Throughout his 
life, he never backed down from fight-
ing for workers. As the leader of the 
12.5-million-member American Federa-
tion of Labor and Congress of Indus-
trial Organizations, he championed 
workers every day. 
He followed in his father’s footsteps. 
He worked in the coal mines of Penn-
sylvania, as his father and his grand-
father before him had. He rose to be-
come president of the United Mine 
Workers and later president of the 
AFL–CIO with one singular focus, pro-
tecting and fighting for the right to or-
ganize and to collectively bargain. 
Earlier in my congressional career, 
in 1996, during one of his many visits to 
my district—and I can remember it 
poignantly because he sat in my kitch-
en along with John Wilhelm, head of 
the Hotel and Restaurant Workers—we 
were on our way to the people’s grad-
uation on the New Haven Green be-
cause we were fighting, and he was 
there to help fight for better contracts 
for the workers at Yale University. 
We were told that we wouldn’t have 
very many people that day on the 
Green, and I will just tell you that they 
were 10,000 strong, led by Rich Trumka, 
John Wilhelm, and other labor leaders 
in this country. They gathered to advo-
cate for new contracts, and he joined 
that chorus to support their efforts. 
Together, I had the opportunity to 
work with him hand in hand to defeat 
the Trans-Pacific Partnership agree-
ment, because it would outsource jobs 
overseas; 
it 
would 
hurt 
American 
workers here. We worked in solidarity 
to renegotiate the new NAFTA agree-
ment in 2019. I was proud to be at the 
center of these fights with Rich and so 
many more. He once said to me, as we 
talked about working together on this, 
he said, ‘‘My dear, we are like two 
coats of paint. We are together.’’ I will 
never forget that conversation. 
While I always valued his counsel, it 
was his friendship that I came to value 
most. Our shared Italian-American her-
itage, our commitment to fighting for 
better working conditions were rooted 
from the lessons that we learned at our 
kitchen tables. My mother was a gar-
ment worker in the sweatshops of the 
city of New Haven. He was a mine 
worker’s son and understood how dif-
ficult that life was and what it meant

for struggling families and why the 
unions were the way out and the way 
for them to get what they earned and 
what they deserved. 
Rich Trumka’s legacy stretches far 
and wide. I do not know where we 
would be without him. Rich’s relentless 
efforts to end unfair trade practices 
and 
restore 
U.S. 
manufacturing 
strength made him a tireless advocate 
for the labor movement in the United 
States and around the globe, and I was 
honored to call him a colleague and a 
dear friend. 
To his family, I say that my thoughts 
and prayers are with you. To his broth-
ers and sisters of the AFL–CIO, I say, 
solidarity. And I thank Rich, my dear 
friend. I thank him for his endless pur-
suit on behalf of those struggling for 
justice. I thank him for his counsel and 
thank him for his friendship. 
Now it is our turn to carry on his leg-
acy, a legacy of championing the dig-
nity of all workers. He has shown us 
the way, and his fight continues in all 
of us. Solidarity now and solidarity 
forever. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Rosa. That was really 
moving. I remember that 1996 day on 
the New Haven Green. 
I yield to the gentleman from Wash-
ington (Mr. KILMER), a great ally of the 
working people of this country. 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Richard 
Trumka, a relentless champion for 
working people. 
When I heard from labor leaders 
across the State of Washington fol-
lowing his passing, without exception 
they spoke about what a substantial 
loss his passing was. 
But in the brief time that I have here 
to reflect on his life, I want to talk 
about what a gain it was to have him 
as a leader in our Nation: A gain for 
folks who, because of his work, can re-
tire with dignity, a gain for workers 
who, because of his leadership, are 
safer and better compensated, a gain 
for every worker who can collectively 
bargain. 
In fact, when I spoke to him last, we 
talked about how important it was to 
support our Federal workers through-
out the region I am proud to represent, 
the brave public servants that protect 
our sailors through their work at the 
shipyard, that prepare our timber sales 
in the Federal forests, that welcome 
visitors to our national parks, that 
care for our veterans, that ensure citi-
zens get the services that they need, 
and that keep us safe. We agreed that 
we need to do everything we can to 
have their backs, and throughout his 
life, he did. 
I also admire that not only did Mr. 
Trumka advocate for our workplaces to 
work better for the American people, 
but he also wanted our country and our 
democracy to work better for working 
people. Advocating to protect access to 
the ballot box and to get big money out 
of politics. 
As president of the AFL–CIO, he 
proudly represented millions of work-
ers throughout our country and hun-
dreds of thousands of workers in Wash-
ington State: Shipbuilders and elec-
trical workers, ironworkers, letter car-
riers, machinists and pipefitters, and 
paper 
workers 
and 
teachers 
and 
healthcare workers. I could go on and 
on and on. These workers are the 
heartbeat of our Nation. 
In honor of his life, we should com-
mit to continuing his legacy to ensure 
workers have dignity, to ensure work-
ers have the right to organize, so that 
they can seek fair pay and better bene-
fits and safer working conditions and 
to make our democracy work better for 
all Americans. 
Madam Speaker, my sincere condo-
lences to his family, to his friends, and 
to every worker and American who was 
touched by his life. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and include extraneous 
material on the topic of this Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
good to see everyone here tonight. This 
is a very special evening, although I 
wish it wasn’t happening. I wish we 
weren’t 
saying 
good-bye 
to 
Rich 
Trumka. 
I remember the first time I saw him 
speak. I thought about, wow, there is a 
lot of intensity there, a lot of inten-
tion, and, yeah, he scared me a little 
bit. 
I was very inspired to join a picket 
line that day. I had been on many pick-
et lines before that, but he delivered 
his comments and what he intended to 
do for labor in such a way that made 
me feel like things were actually pos-
sible, that it was possible to make 
change at an employer, it was possible 
to make change at a plant. 
And so specifically I joined a plant 
and their picket line. I didn’t know 
anybody. I just showed up because I 
thought, wow, this guy is someone that 
I will follow, I will follow into fire. And 
I did, at least long distance for a long 
time. 
b 1715 
And I have to tell you one other 
thing about Rich. One of the things 
that is immediately obvious—and I fre-
quently see this in friends of mine that 
are in the military—he is a servant 
leader true and true and through and 
through. And I think that is the best 
kind of leader to be. 
So I learned a lot from him and all of 
his work, but mostly I believe he in-
spired the movement to be stronger 
and more vibrant in the last decade. 
So we say good-bye to Rich with 
heavy hearts but thank him for his 
amazing work and his ability to in-
spire. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI), one of the co- 
chairs of the Labor Caucus in the 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. 
SUOZZI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Congressman LEVIN for yielding 
and for organizing this special order. 
We are so grateful to you for making 
sure we take this time to stop and 
honor 
the 
great 
legacy 
of 
Rich 
Trumka. 
I first came to Congress in 2017, and 
one of the first things I did was request 
a meeting with Rich Trumka, and he 
took me to breakfast. I have always 
been a prolabor person through my 
time as mayor and county executive of 
Nassau County. And I talked to him, 
and he made it very clear that what he 
was looking for and what the labor 
movement is looking for are champions 
that will be with you no matter what; 
not with you on some issues and not on 
other issues, but with you 100 percent. 
Everything he said to me that morn-
ing really resonated with me. And I de-
cided from that moment on that I 
would make it clear that I would be a 
true friend of labor because of the in-
struction of Rich Trumka. 
The country has changed so much 
from the time from when he served as 
president of the United Mine Workers 
Union in the 1980s. And since the 1980s, 
we have seen tremendous growth in 
wealth in America. We have seen the 
Dow Jones go up 1,900 percent. We have 
seen the GDP go up 900 percent. But 
workers’ wages during that same pe-
riod of time have gone up less than 20 
percent. So we have created enormous 
wealth in our country, but we are not 
sharing it with the men and women 
who go to work every day. 
Rich Trumka has reminded us how 
important it is that for this great sys-
tem of capitalism to survive in our 
country, the best system that has ever 
been in human history, which has cre-
ated more wealth, more innovation, 
has lifted more people out of poverty, 
for it to survive for the long-term fu-
ture, we have to learn how capitalism 
and our economic system can share the 
great production of wealth with the 
people who go to work every day. 
Because the American Dream is 
based upon a very simple concept: if I 
go to work, I will make enough money. 
And with that money I can buy a home; 
I can educate my children; I can have 
health insurance; and I can retire one 
day in security without being scared. 
Rich Trumka reminded us of that 
every day of his life, that we need to 
recreate the American Dream for peo-
ple in this country; that hard work will 
be rewarded with sufficient wealth so 
that you can live the American Dream. 
So my condolences to the Trumka 
family. Thank you to my colleague for 
setting this up. And thank you to Rich 
Trumka, a good and faithful servant, 
who has made our country a better 
place. And let’s honor him by making

sure we do everything we can to sup-
port the labor movement in this coun-
try. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), a true cham-
pion of workers in this country for dec-
ades in this House, the longest serving 
woman in the history of the House of 
Representatives, and my good friend. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman LEVIN
so very 
much, my Great Lakes buddy, for spon-
soring this very deserved tribute this 
evening to Richard Trumka. 
It truly is an honor to be here today 
in fellowship with my colleagues and 
those who are unyielding in their com-
mitment to creating a better world for 
the hardworking men and women who 
build our Nation and world forward. 
No one embodied that devotion more 
deeply than the man whose life we cele-
brate here today: Richard Trumka. 
For 
nearly 
50 
years, 
President 
Trumka was steadfast in his dedication 
to advancing the dignity and worth of 
American and guest workers who clock 
into work every day to earn a living to 
provide for themselves and their fami-
lies and do the work before them. 
Each bring about their own version 
of the American Dream. 
I knew Rich from his earliest days 
leading the United Mine Workers of 
America from 1983 to 1995 as its presi-
dent, and I was blessed to call him a 
friend. 
I well recall when the mine workers 
conducted a national strike against 
Peabody Coal in 1993 to achieve better 
wages and working conditions in this 
dangerous industry. 
I always respected Rich as an ally in 
the battles against job-outsourcing 
trade agreements like NAFTA, which 
opened up the chutes for corporations 
to ship jobs overseas, unleashing a dev-
astation of America’s middle class and 
industrial America, the likes of which 
we had never seen before. 
Having stood alongside him for many 
of these fights over the years, I wit-
nessed firsthand how global his reach 
truly was. 
I recall one convening in particular 
that he organized with workers from 
across the world. 
There I saw how acutely he under-
stood the need for working people to 
band together across national bound-
aries in common cause to better work-
ing conditions for all. He saw the fu-
ture. 
From the coal mines to Congress, 
workers had no fiercer advocate than 
when they were attacked by special in-
terests or antiworker lawmakers. 
We shall all miss him and his passion 
immensely. 
I take heart in the knowledge that he 
left behind a coalition that is well pre-
pared to take on the challenges that lie 
ahead. 
America’s unions are strong as the 
cause they pursue is just. 
And in his memory, let us push for-
ward on the path to building back bet-
ter for the American people. 
The working men and women of labor 
are poised and will distinguish them-
selves in retooling our Nation for the 
century ahead. And there will be many 
pylons that will be installed that will 
be done in the memory of Richard 
Trumka. 
May God carry him high and give 
him deserved rest. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), Rich 
Trumka’s great partner in the House of 
Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank Congressman LEVIN
for orga-
nizing this Special Order for a very spe-
cial person. It is my honor to partici-
pate. I know you were a great friend 
and ally of President Trumka, and he 
would be so proud that you are leading 
the way for us this evening. 
Richard Trumka. That name is syn-
onymous with workers’ rights. Richard 
Trumka, fairness for everyone. Richard 
Trumka, middle class with a union 
label on it. Richard Trumka, fighter 
for the people. 
As we are engaged in our negotia-
tions now, I think of Richard every day 
because he always said, when you get 
down to the end of the negotiation, 
that is when you have to be the strong-
est. Never tire. Never tire. Always save 
energy for that final negotiation. Be-
cause sometimes people relax and say, 
well, let’s just get it over with, but 
Richard Trumka would never adopt 
that attitude when he was there work-
ing for the workers. 
Richard Trumka was an unsurpassed 
titan of the labor movement. A third- 
generation coal miner, Richard dedi-
cated his life for the right to organize 
from his work at the United Mine 
Workers of America to his decades-long 
leadership of the AFL–CIO. 
In 
everything 
he 
did, 
Richard 
Trumka was always thinking about the 
workers. What can we do to give them 
more certainty in their lives in terms 
of good pay, jobs, benefits, and working 
conditions? 
Richard Trumka was a great patriot, 
and he fought always to strengthen the 
middle class, as I said, and lift up those 
who aspire to it, understanding that 
the middle class—again, which is the 
backbone of our democracy—has a 
union label on it. 
Richard carried his values into other 
realms of public policy, as he recog-
nized and respected the dignity of all 
people, whether speaking out against 
Apartheid in South Africa or fighting 
bigotry and racism at home. His lead-
ership transcended any single move-
ment. 
Richard’s courage in speaking truth 
to power made a difference for mil-
lions. And it made Richard a respected 
ally in Congress’ mission to advance 
the health, financial security, and well- 
being of working families. 
After his passing, many members im-
mediately called for the PRO Act—the 
cornerstone of Democrats’ proworker 
agenda—to be renamed in his Honor. 
Doing so would be a fitting way to pay 
tribute to this great hero for workers. 
We did pass the pension bill in the res-
cue package and now the PRO Act. 
While we remain heartbroken over 
Richard’s passing, we take comfort in 
knowing 
that 
Richard’s 
leadership 
gives a legacy that will inspire count-
less people for years and generations to 
come. 
I know I share the same impression 
when we heard that he died. It was 
like, it can’t be. He is a giant. He is so 
strong. It can’t be, but it was. 
Again, the legacy that he left is 
something we will always build on in 
his memory. May it be a comfort to his 
wife, Barbara, their loved ones, and the 
11 million men and women of the AFL– 
CIO that so many mourn their loss. We 
are praying for them at this sad time. 
Richard Trumka, we love you. We 
miss you. May you rest in peace. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. TONKO), another person 
like MARCY KAPTUR and me who rep-
resents a district full of gritty, work-
ing-class factories and neighborhoods 
that Rich championed so fiercely. 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I thank 
Congressman LEVIN for arranging this 
evening’s special order. 
Today we honor the remarkable life 
of Richard Trumka, a person who 
poured his entire heart and voice and 
passion into what is right for workers 
and what is right for union workers. 
Rich emboldened that mission and 
fought with great fierceness in order to 
achieve. Rich taught us that anything 
worth fighting for deserves our efforts 
beyond belief, and he poured himself 
passionately into his mission. 
A fierce champion of the labor move-
ment and fearless proponent of the 
rights of working people, Rich revolu-
tionized collective bargaining and civil 
disobedience as a mechanism for mean-
ingful change in our modern era. 
I was deeply saddened and stunned to 
learn of Rich’s sudden passing back in 
August. 
A great friend to so many of us, my-
self included and my district, we 
worked together to build strong en-
forceable labor standards into the 
heart of the new NAFTA agreement, 
which gives American workers a fair 
shot and level playing field on the glob-
al stage. 
That kind of fight was at the heart of 
Richard’s lifelong work, using union-
ism as a tool to build a fairer economy, 
a more just economy, a more robust 
and competitive economy for our soci-
ety. 
We must honor his indelible legacy 
and deliver the kind of generational 
change for which he fought day in and 
day out by creating good-paying union 
jobs and tackling the climate crisis, ra-
cial injustice, and economic injustice 
that disproportionately hurts working 
people. 
My sincerest condolences go out to 
the entire Trumka family and all of his 
loved ones.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5921 
October 26, 2021 
May Richard rest in peace. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the majority 
leader of the House of Representatives. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, who 
has been a dear friend of mine as his fa-
ther was for a very long period of time. 
And we share in common a lot of 
things, but one of those things that we 
share in common is a great respect for 
Richard Trumka, a great appreciation 
for 
the 
leadership 
that 
Richard 
Trumka showed, not only in the labor 
movement but in our country as a cit-
izen representing our best values. 
And we share respect for the labor 
movement. 
Richard Trumka, Madam Speaker, 
walked with the weight of America’s 
workers on his shoulders, but he wore 
that weight lightly in one sense and 
with a great sense of responsibility in 
another sense. 
b 1730 
He carried them with him always in 
his mind and in his soul. His life was 
devoted to the labor movement and to 
each and every worker who was part of 
the labor movement. 
His loss, in my view, is a grievous 
one for our country, and he leaves be-
hind a legacy for which we can all be 
grateful: the men and women in labor 
who have a better wage, a better place 
to work, and greater security because 
of Richard Trumka. 
Thanks to Mr. Trumka, workers 
across the United States today have 
stronger 
representation 
and 
safer 
working conditions. 
Madam Speaker, 12.5 million union 
members and countless others have 
looked up to him for decades as a force 
for our positive change, an unrivaled 
leader in the labor movement. 
Few people epitomized the ideas of 
the workers’ rights movement, which 
are also core values of the Democratic 
Party, in the way Mr. Trumka did. He 
was a fighter, but he was also a great 
tactician and strategist. Those, of 
course, are the determination and at-
tributes that everyone who works hard 
ought to be able to get ahead and that 
working families ought to be able to 
access opportunities and economic se-
curity. 
From the beginning of his career, 
first as a coal miner and then as presi-
dent of the United Mine Workers of 
America, he was committed to forging 
closer ties between workers and their 
union representatives. He ultimately 
became president of the AFL–CIO be-
cause not only was he committed to do 
that, he did it. He accomplished it. 
He made a difference for workers, for 
their families, and for America. He 
knew that union action was the great-
est tool available to achieve labor re-
forms and to make economic security 
more attainable for workers and their 
families. 
As American workers continue to 
face new challenges as a result of the 
pandemic, it is essential that policy-
makers continue to work closely with 
organized labor and leaders like Rich-
ard Trumka. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has placed so many of our work-
ers and their families in situations 
dangerous to their health and also to 
their economic well-being. More than 
ever, workers need champions for their 
rights, their fair wages, and their fair 
benefits, and they are missing that 
champion they called President Rich-
ard Trumka. 
We need to ensure that workers con-
tinue to have a strong voice in Con-
gress, and we need to do everything we 
can to keep them and their families 
safe and able to access opportunities. 
Madam Speaker, in his last major 
speech, Mr. Trumka told Texas AFL– 
CIO members that inequality is the 
greatest threat to democracy. He said 
this: ‘‘Without the right to vote and 
without the right to organize, there is 
no democracy.’’ 
I share that view with Richard 
Trumka. Our Democratic House major-
ity will not waver in our work to se-
cure both the right to organize and the 
right to vote. They are really two of 
the same principle. 
We look forward to working just as 
closely with Liz Shuler—I might say a 
historic figure in her own right, like 
our Speaker, who spoke a little while 
ago—the first woman to lead the AFL– 
CIO. She has worked alongside Richard 
Trumka for years, helping him realize 
his goals for the organization in its 
fight for workers’ rights in this coun-
try. Richard Trumka’s vision for the 
future was one of dignity and justice 
for all working Americans. 
Madam Speaker, we remain com-
mitted to that vision and will continue 
to honor his memory by fighting to re-
alize his dream for all working Ameri-
cans. 
God bless Richard Trumka, and may 
God keep his family in the hollow of 
his hand. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 23 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LEVIN), the better half 
of the Levin caucus, my brother. 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my dear friend from 
Michigan and the other half of the un-
official Levin caucus. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the late Richard Trumka, a 
fierce fighter for the hardworking men 
and women of America’s labor move-
ment. 
Rich Trumka dedicated his life to 
protecting the safety of workers, en-
suring the right to organize, and up-
holding the principle that each and 
every person is to be treated with dig-
nity and respect in the workplace. 
For many years, Richard worked 
with Presidents and Members of Con-
gress on both sides of the aisle to ad-
vance workers’ rights. Richard ap-
proached legislation with clear intent, 
passion, and purpose, to ensure that no 
worker was left behind or abandoned. 
Simply put, Rich Trumka’s life was a 
testament to the amazing power behind 
organizing and fighting for progress. 
America’s 
workers 
are 
better 
off, 
thanks to his many years rallying for 
those without a voice. I know his leg-
acy will live on in all of us who he in-
spired. 
With Richard’s legacy in mind, I am 
recommitted, as are many of my col-
leagues, to creating a better America 
that lifts up working people and pro-
motes a society that treats every per-
son with kindness, dignity, and re-
spect. 
We now have an extraordinary oppor-
tunity, right now, to honor Richard, 
not just in words, but in deeds, by cre-
ating good-paying union jobs as part of 
the Build Back Better agenda. Let’s 
get this done for him. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, I have to say that 
this tribute to our great friend, Rich 
Trumka, would not be complete truly 
without hearing from the representa-
tive of his home district, his home area 
in Nemacolin, Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB), 
my brother. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Michigan. 
This is the mask of the Allegheny- 
Fayette Labor Council, which rep-
resents the coal miners that President 
Trumka loved so well. 
Madam Speaker, before he was the 
president of the AFL–CIO and an inter-
nationally known figure, he was a 
western Pennsylvanian. Rich Trumka 
was a football player, a deer hunter, a 
member of a great family. What I re-
spected about him so much is that the 
western Pennsylvania part of Rich 
Trumka never went away. It always 
shone through. 
I heard him speak one time where he 
said one of the problems with our oppo-
nents in politics is that they want you 
to think the economy is just like the 
weather. It is just something that hap-
pens to people, and we might be able to 
predict it and prepare for it, but there 
is nothing we can do to change it. 
He knew that in parts of the country, 
like ours in western Pennsylvania, peo-
ple had heard versions of that for so 
long at such high volume with so much 
corporate money and messaging behind 
it that it threatened the basic fabric of 
our community. 
The unions built the middle class not 
just in America but particularly in 
western Pennsylvania, and that has 
eroded over time. The benefits and the 
value of the labor movement have re-
ceded in a lot of people’s minds. To me, 
the most western Pennsylvania thing 
about President Trumka was that he 
never gave up on it because he knew 
that our people never really accepted

October 26, 2021 
the result of the recession of the labor 
movement, the inequality and injustice 
that has grown, the way so many of our 
towns have been hollowed out, and the 
way people looked to the future now 
sometimes with cynicism instead of op-
timism and hope. 
Madam Speaker, to me, what he rep-
resented was that he really lived out 
the kind of abstract idea we have that 
the interests and the struggle of a coal 
miner can be the same as the interest 
and struggle as someone who works in 
home healthcare or someone who sur-
vived a nursing home during the pan-
demic working for less than $15 an 
hour. 
We have a lot of those in western 
Pennsylvania now. Healthcare is one of 
our biggest economic drivers, and those 
people are not paid well for the risks 
that they take and the hard, back-
breaking work that they do. 
Coal miners know something about 
that. I think that the best way we can 
honor President Trumka is to set aside 
some of the many differences that we 
have, even within the Democratic fam-
ily and the labor family, and refocus 
ourselves on the core economic issues 
that tie together all the working- and 
middle-class people in this country 
that, themselves, represent such a pow-
erful force that they really can’t be 
stopped when people unite with each 
other. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LEVIN 
for pulling this together, and may God 
protect Richard Trumka. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Representative LAMB. 
Madam Speaker, it is really fitting 
that we are honoring Rich Trumka 
during what has come to be called 
Striketober. This month has seen more 
workers in motion in more industries 
across more regions than at any time 
in modern history. 
We have people in the healthcare in-
dustry, nurses, on strike. 
We have miners in Alabama, mem-
bers of Rich Trumka’s home union, the 
United 
Mine 
Workers 
of 
America, 
toughing it out for a better life in their 
workplace. 
We have agricultural and industrial 
workers. 
We have workers like those at John 
Deere represented by the UAW striking 
for better conditions. 
We had stage and production work-
ers, members of IATSE, go right up to 
a strike deadline to demand a better 
and fairer contract. 
We have food production workers, 
like those from Kellogg’s, a company 
based in my home State of Michigan. 
Rich Trumka knew that workers 
never want to go on strike, but the 
right to withhold your labor is a sacred 
right that every worker should possess, 
and it should be protected by law. 
When he had to lead a strike, he 
showed that he was up to it in order to 
get fairness for workers he represented 
and workers all over this country. 
Madam Speaker, I want to also men-
tion—and Leader HOYER
mentioned 
this—that Rich’s passing was so unex-
pected. A number of people have men-
tioned this. It was shocking to us be-
cause he seemed like such a strong, 
strong figure. It is hard to imagine him 
passing from the scene. 
But I do have to commend the execu-
tive council of the AFL–CIO, the offi-
cers of the AFL–CIO, for carrying on. 
That is what we do in the labor move-
ment. We carry on the struggle for jus-
tice, for the workers of this country, 
and in particular, Liz Shuler, who was 
chosen by the executive council to step 
up and become president for the re-
mainder of Rich’s term. 
I have known Liz since she was an as-
sistant to the president at IBEW back 
when Ed Hill was president there. She 
was a really important ally when I was 
on the AFL–CIO staff, and she was 
IBEW staff in those days, then her elec-
tion as secretary-treasurer, her years 
of working with Rich Trumka. I didn’t 
know what to do when he passed, on 
the morning that he passed, so I called 
Liz. She was heartbroken. Yet, she just 
immediately stood up and said we will 
not miss a beat. We will fight on for 
the workers of this country. 
I know she will do a tremendous job 
in leading. She is a historic figure, as 
STENY HOYER said, the first woman to 
lead the national labor union move-
ment in this country. 
In terms of Rich, himself, and his 
passing and how we should take it, I 
want to quote the words of one of my 
favorite union songs called ‘‘I Dreamed 
I Saw Joe Hill Last Night,’’ a song 
about a union leader who was murdered 
unjustly by the copper bosses. The 
premise of the song is Joe Hill appears 
to someone in a dream, and these lyrics 
say: 
Joe Hill ain’t dead, he says to me, 
Joe Hill ain’t never died. 
And now I add working women. 
Where working men are out on strike, 
Joe Hill is at their side. 
Joe Hill is at their side. 
From San Diego up to Maine, 
In every mine and mill, 
Where workers strike and organize, 
It’s there you’ll find Joe Hill. 
It’s there you’ll find Joe Hill. 
And Rich Trumka will be there with 
us in every labor struggle. His spirit, 
his militancy, his insistence on justice 
for working people will always be with 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my good 
friend, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman LEVIN
for the 
courtesy of yielding to me and for or-
ganizing this recognition for Richard 
Trumka. 
As has been documented here on the 
floor this evening, he was truly a giant 
in terms of organized labor, for social 
justice, his passion, his energy. But I 
wanted to just note one item that I 
thought was really remarkable. 
As I became chair of the Trade Sub-
committee on Ways and Means, Mr. 
Trumka arranged for me to have lunch 
with him and a half dozen different 
leaders, with six international union 
presidents talking about the need to be 
able to have a worker-centered trade 
policy. 
b 1745 
It was a remarkable exchange of 
ideas and opinions and commitments 
to work together. And we took a 
NAFTA agreement that could not pass 
on the floor of the House and worked 
together to be able to have a process 
that was worthy of support. There was 
nobody who was more essential to that 
than Richard Trumka, who was tireless 
in his efforts to make sure that that 
legislation moving forward would re-
spect workers’ rights, that we would 
deal with enforcement of labor agree-
ments. They should be worth the paper 
they were printed on. 
I’ll go to my grave convinced that if 
we had had that opportunity earlier 
with the Obama administration, we 
wouldn’t have had some of those con-
cerns, we could have resolved issues of 
investor-state and worker rights. 
Rich Trumka was tireless in terms of 
his determination. He was a tough ne-
gotiator. He was fair. He was honest. 
As I say, reaching out even to a new 
subcommittee chair. He took the time, 
brought people together so that we 
could fashion an area of common cause 
going forward. 
It struck me, as the measure of the 
man, with all the things that were on 
his plate, that he would take the time 
to deal with these important details 
and be able to expose it to other labor 
leaders. It is the measure of his leader-
ship, the legacy that he leaves, and we 
are all fortunate that we have had an 
opportunity to work with him over the 
years. He will be missed but his legacy 
will linger on. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER), another 
great colleague who knew Richard 
Trumka. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the memory of 
Richard Trumka, one of the most dedi-
cated champions of labor and working 
families in our Nation’s history. Like 
so many others—I don’t have a photo 
like Andy has—but I will tell you, my 
moments in time where I got to speak 
to and visit with a legend were ones 
that are seared in my memory because 
he just brought out the best in every-
one around him. The lives he impacted 
and the people he moved will never be 
forgotten. 
We all know that he started his ca-
reer as a union man in the mines in 
Pennsylvania, 
like 
his 
father 
and 
grandfather before him, working his 
way through college and law school as 
a miner. 
After law school, instead of leaving 
the world he knew behind, Rich decided 
to use his skills to fight on behalf of it 
and dedicated the rest of his career to 
the labor movement, to the hard-
working men and women of labor,

October 26, 2021 
eventually becoming the president of 
the largest labor union in the United 
States of America. 
He had an unrivaled sense of grit and 
determination that was paired with a 
deeply-held belief in the dignity of all 
work, and the rights of all workers. It 
was this combination that led him to 
spend his whole life fighting to ensure 
that every American worker has access 
to the wages, safety, healthcare, and fi-
nances that they deserve. 
Rich spent every day pushing to en-
sure that the American worker could 
build a good and honorable middle 
class life through their own hard work. 
You could feel it when you spent time 
with him. He was just somebody who 
cared deeply about the people around 
him, and then making sure everyone’s 
best days were ahead of them. 
He 
was 
innovative 
and 
forward- 
thinking, constantly working to build 
an AFL–CIO for the 21st century. In 
fact, I argue that the AFL–CIO and the 
modern labor movement are what they 
are because of Mr. Trumka. The hard-
working women and men of labor are 
better off, and our country is better off 
because of the legacy that he leaves be-
hind. 
He, in many ways, is irreplaceable 
and will be deeply missed by so many 
men and women across our country for 
so many years to come. We will never 
forget him. Madam Speaker, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in remembering a 
great leader, Richard Trumka. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I want to end, in the spirit of 
Rich Trumka, by thanking my legisla-
tive 
assistant, 
Meseret Araya, for 
doing an amazing job of organizing this 
Special Order and thanking all the 
staff who work the floor of the House 
of Representatives for doing such an 
amazing job of keeping this place run-
ning. 
Madam Speaker, I want to say to 
Barbara and the whole Trumka family 
that we are so grateful to you for shar-
ing this person with us, with the mine 
workers union and with all the unions 
of the AFL–CIO, and with all the work-
ers of America and of this world. 
Rich, we love you. You will be in our 
hearts forever. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, we lost a 
steadfast leader for hard-working families and 
people across the country in Richard Trumka. 
A union worker himself, serving as the 
President of the United Mine Workers of 
America before becoming the President of 
AFL–CIO, he was a giant among labor leaders 
and advocates and never once backed down 
from fighting for workers’ rights and speaking 
truth to power. 
A steadfast champion for income equality, 
stronger benefits, and robust protections on 
the job, he knew that fighting for workers not 
only uplifts working families but drives our 
economy forward. 
His commitment to a fair and just society 
that is built upon the foundation of a strong 
middle class and provides for each subse-
quent generation of workers remains unparal-
leled. 
His passing is a profound loss for this 
movement, but his life and his determination 
serve as a role model for all of us to continue 
his critical work and remain dedicated to em-
powering and supporting workers and their 
families across the United States. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, today, we 
honor the life of a fearless labor leader, Rich-
ard Trumka. With his recent passing, the 
working people of America lost an outspoken, 
powerful voice. 
Mr. Trumka dedicated his life and career to 
serving American workers. From his early 
days as a staff attorney for the United Mine 
Workers of America and throughout his tenure 
as President of the American Federation of 
Labor and Congress of Industrial Organiza-
tions, he was a consistent champion for social 
and economic justice, fair wages, and safe 
working conditions—and our nation is better 
for it. 
During my time in Congress, I had the 
pleasure of meeting with Mr. Trumka on sev-
eral occasions to discuss the challenges fac-
ing American families and union workers, and 
to explore the ways in which we could lift up 
all people. He was a fierce advocate for poli-
cies that had the power to produce real, 
meaningful results that would improve count-
less lives. 
Now more than ever, as our country and our 
economy grapple with the devastating effects 
of the COVID–19 pandemic, we will miss Mr. 
Trumka ’s presence in the fight to fully recover 
from the economic downturn and difficulties 
we’ve experienced, but we will never stop the 
work he started. The way to honor his memory 
is by empowering workers and the unions that 
represent them. 
I offer my sincerest condolences to the fam-
ily, friends, colleagues, and loved ones of Mr. 
Trumka during this time. 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, Mr. Richard 
Trumka blessed our nation with leadership, 
courage, and dignity, fighting for working men 
and women throughout his life. Born into a 
coal mining family in Nemacolin, Pennsyl-
vania, near Pittsburg, Richard never forgot his 
working-class roots. 
At the age of 19, Richard followed the foot-
steps of his father and grandfather—straight 
into the mine shafts, alternating several 
months below ground and several months in 
school. He graduated from Pennsylvania State 
and received a law degree from Villanova. 
Then for 13 years, he led the United Mine 
Workers of America as its elected president 
before bringing his staunch advocacy to the 
AFL–CIO, first as its secretary-treasurer, then 
as its president. 
Many will remember Richard as a leader 
who opened the door of opportunity for mil-
lions of Americans. I, too, will remember Rich-
ard in the same vein. Today, Hawaii’s working 
men and women share more of the nation’s 
wealth because of Richard’s leadership at the 
AFL–CIO. 
I will also remember Richard for his fight for 
social and racial justice when in the early 
1980s, he took a strong stand in solidarity with 
Black mineworkers in South Africa. Richard 
chaired the U.S. Boycott Committee, mobilized 
the support of other unions, and rallied opposi-
tion to apartheid. He urged the AFL–CIO to 
support the boycott against the Royal Dutch 
Shell, who, as he explained, was a critical 
multinational corporation propping up the 
South African government. 
At a 1988 rally in Chicago, Richard stated 
that ‘‘true labor solidarity cannot be limited by 
national boundaries or the color of a person’s 
skin. My opposition to apartheid comes not 
only from my personal beliefs and values, but 
is also deeply rooted in the history of my 
union.’’ 
Richard was a true traditional union leader 
who fought for economic, social, and racial 
justice for all. Richard stood for true solidarity. 
Looking upon us from above, Richard just 
might be saying, ‘‘Don’t mourn, Organize!’’ 
Aloha oe, Richard. Mahalo for devoting your 
life to uplifting the lives of all Americans and 
working people throughout the world. 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, today I 
pay tribute to my late friend, Rich Trumka. 
Rich was a labor giant who dedicated his 
life to fighting for workers and giving them a 
voice. 
His death was a huge and sudden loss for 
all of us, especially the working people of this 
country—even those who never knew him. 
Rich was a friend to all, and many of us 
were lucky enough to know him personally. 
I first met Rich at an AFL meeting in Cherry 
Hill, NJ, when I was a labor leader in South 
Jersey, and he was raising money for 
coalminers on strike back in the 80s. 
From there, I was lucky to work with Rich 
for three decades, from his time with the 
Mineworkers to his leadership at AFL–CIO. 
Rich improved the lives of workers by lead-
ing winning battles across the nation to secure 
better benefits, higher wages, and safer work-
ing conditions. 
His memory will live on as he has set the 
stage for workers to lead the way in the eco-
nomic recovery. 
Specifically, Rich was a big proponent of the 
PRO Act, and now we will work to honor his 
legacy and ensure this critical piece of legisla-
tion becomes law. Because of Rich Trumka, 
the labor movement will forever be changed 
for the better. 
We will continue to push forward and follow 
the path he paved for so many. 
His steadfast leadership and powerful voice 
will be missed by all who had the honor to 
work with him. 
My condolences go to his family, loved 
ones, and all who knew him.

VACCINATION MANDATE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my colleagues’ tribute to Mr. 
Trumka. Whether or not we always 
agree with every issue, it is always 
great to see a life that is being honored 
here on the floor of the House of Rep-
resentatives. I appreciate that. 
I appreciate his sentiments about 
staff and the hard work the staff car-
ries out each and every day here on the 
floor of the House of Representatives, 
as well as in each of our offices. I join 
my colleague in each of those things. 
Madam Speaker, I would note that in 
the context of supporting workers, sup-
porting the people across this country 
who are indeed engaging right now in 
many respects in saying no and strik-
ing and deciding that they are not

going to participate, I would say a lot 
of that has to do, unfortunately, with 
the mandates that have been pressed 
on workers by the efforts of the Presi-
dent of the United States, President 
Biden, and an illegal and unconstitu-
tional requirement that employers vac-
cinate their workers, or those workers 
might be forced to lose their job. 
This has very real consequences. We 
have seen thousands of workers across 
this country protesting. Police mem-
bers walking out. Firefighters walking 
out. Teachers walking out. People in 
industries 
and 
airlines 
and 
places 
across 
the 
country 
walking 
out. 
Nurses. Nurses, who were serving this 
country on the front lines during the 
pandemic last year when we didn’t 
know all that was going on, and now 
they are being forced to decide to quit 
because of an unconscionable, illegal, 
unnecessary, unconstitutional mandate 
by the President of the United States. 
The government is forcing its citizens 
to make these tough choices. 
Madam Speaker, I have a dear friend 
who lives in Alabama, and she said to 
me: I had a long talk with a doctor, 
and he is not anti-vax by any stretch, 
he has had this vaccine. He is con-
cerned. I am concerned. This is from 
my friend: I have been a decade-plus 
living with multiple sclerosis, and I am 
not in any way anxious to provoke an 
immune response by getting the vac-
cination. 
But now she is being forced to decide 
whether or not she can continue to 
teach. She just wants to teach. And 
now the university for which she works 
is saying she must get vaccinated or 
you are going to lose your job. Now, 
you say, well, just go seek an accom-
modation. 
Listen to what the geniuses at the 
university at which she works sent out 
as their accommodation. To be eligible 
for possible exception, you must first 
establish that your refusal to be vac-
cinated is based upon a sincere belief 
that it is religious in nature. A refusal 
to be vaccinated does not qualify for an 
exception if it is based upon personal 
preference, concerns about the possible 
effects of the vaccine—I want to pause 
for a second—concerns about the pos-
sible effects of the vaccine does not 
qualify for an exception. 
Yet, my friend, may now seek a reli-
gious exception because she has reli-
gious concerns about it. But she also 
has very real concerns as an MS sur-
vivor, someone dealing and living with 
MS. She is having to make a call about 
what is in her best interest. She is a 
mother of three children. Two of her 
children have had issues and reactions, 
arguably, attached to different vac-
cinations in the past. 
And never before in the history of the 
United States of America has the Fed-
eral Government gone out and issued 
an edict from Washington demanding 
that the American people get vac-
cinated. Think about that. Never be-
fore in our history. It hasn’t happened. 
Yes, it can happen in our military, al-
though we should be careful about it. 
Nobody should get dishonorably dis-
charged. Nobody should get discharged. 
It has happened at places where the 
Federal Government has a direct im-
pact on the employment of an indi-
vidual. But all of these decisions have 
been left to local and State govern-
ments, local schools, local hospitals. 
But no, no, President Biden in his in-
finite wisdom, such as that may be, has 
suggested now by mandate that every-
body get vaccinated and every business 
must vaccinate their employees. 
The fact of the matter is, we are now 
almost 600 days in to the 15 days to 
slow the spread. The government lying 
to its citizens, continuing to move the 
goalpost of normalcy, moving it fur-
ther away. 
Now the President wants a 97 percent 
vaccination rate, which he completely 
made up and pulled out of thin air, 
which is pretty much the entire defini-
tion of his entire incompetent, absurd 
Presidency. 
The government of this country de-
rives its just powers from the governed. 
The government of this country derives 
its power from the consent of the gov-
erned. And, thankfully, brave Ameri-
cans across this country are standing 
up every day and telling this President 
to pound sand. They happen to be using 
a different colloquialism. 
Southwest Airlines pilots spoke out 
and they just scrapped the plan to put 
unvaccinated employees out of work. 
In-N-Out Burger. ‘‘We refuse to be-
come the vaccination police for any 
government.’’ God bless them. Go get 
an In-and-Out burger. 
General Electric employees of Green-
ville, South Carolina, walk out over a 
vaccination mandate. 
A New York hospital stopped deliv-
ering babies as workers quit over a vac-
cine mandate. 
Washington State employees quit, 
1,900 of them fired over a vaccine man-
date. 
A trooper tells Governor Inslee in 
Washington to kiss my—fill in the 
blank—in the final sign-off before a 
vaccine mandate. 
Seattle first responders. 
Parents in California protest student 
vaccine mandates. 
Vaccine opponents protest outside 
Stormont 
Vail 
following 
hospital’s 
shot requirement. 
A Wyoming teenager was arrested 
after refusing to wear a mask on school 
grounds, family says. 
Well, God bless these individuals 
across this country who are telling this 
President to pound sand, and telling 
any Governor, or any member of the 
government in their State or local 
community exercising tyranny over 
their freedom as Americans to make 
the choices that they think are correct 
in their lives to pound sand. 
But why are we in this position, 
Madam Speaker? 
As I sit here, with rapt attention 
from all of the Members of Congress 
who are in here having a robust debate 
about the future of our country, as op-
posed to being out, say, having steak 
dinners with whoever the heck they are 
having dinners with in this town, and I 
ask: Why are we in this position? Why 
are we here? 
Last week we discovered with very 
clear terms that Dr. Fauci misled 
Americans during questioning from 
RAND
PAUL
in two different Health 
Committee hearings. 
Dr. Fauci said on May 11, 2021: ‘‘With 
all due respect, you are entirely and 
completely incorrect,’’ speaking to Dr. 
PAUL. ‘‘The NIH has not ever and does 
not now fund gain-of-function research 
in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.’’ 
Later, ‘‘However, I will repeat again, 
the NIH and NIAID categorically has 
not funded gain-of-function research to 
be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology.’’ 
In a July 11, 2021 hearing, Fauci said: 
‘‘Senator PAUL, I have never lied before 
the Congress, and I do not retract that 
statement. This paper’’—that you are 
referring to—‘‘was judged by qualified 
staff up and down the chain as not 
being gain-of-function.’’ 
b 1800 
But what do we now know? 
We know that NIH did, in fact, fund 
gain of function research at the Wuhan 
lab. EcoHealth Alliance ‘‘manipulated 
a coronavirus to generate up to 10,000 
times the viral load, violating provi-
sions of its National Institutes of 
Health contract that forbade unregu-
lated research that could make a dis-
ease significantly more dangerous or 
transmissible.’’ 
That quote was in the rightwing con-
spiracy media paper Roll Call. 
My Republican colleagues on the 
Oversight and Reform Committee re-
ceived a letter from NIH that con-
firmed that EcoHealth Alliance, which 
received money from NIAID, violated 
the terms of their NIH grant because 
they made the virus more deadly to hu-
manized mice. 
In a September letter to me, Dr. 
Fauci said that because the research at 
Wuhan was not anticipated to be gain 
of function, it was approved. 
But why then did the Defense Ad-
vance Research Project Agency, known 
in this town as DARPA, reject similar 
research due to gain of function con-
cerns? 
The NIH had a definition of gain of 
function on its web page which was 
available as recently as October 19, just 
a couple of days ago, it has now been 
changed entirely. 
Why would it be changed? 
Why would the NIH change their gain 
of function web pages this week? 
Could it be that Dr. Fauci was caught 
last week in his exchange by Dr. RAND 
PAUL, my friend, the Senator? 
Now they don’t even say gain-of- 
function research on the website. They 
took it off. It now says EPPP research. 
Now it says instead of—the term gain- 
of-function research describes a type of 
research that modifies the biological

agent so that it confers a new or en-
hanced activity to that agent. 
It now says, on limited occasions, 
when justified by compelling public 
health need and conducted in very high 
biosecurity laboratories, NIH has sup-
ported certain research that may be 
reasonably anticipated to create trans-
fer or use— Come on. 
Madam Speaker, do you want to 
know why the American people don’t 
believe their government? 
They 
shouldn’t. 
They 
shouldn’t, 
Madam Speaker. They shouldn’t be-
lieve the lies that are coming out of 
our national health leaders that are en-
dangering the American people as Dr. 
Fauci’s lies have been doing for the 
better part of 18 months. 
Why trust an NIH that is by defini-
tion not being truthful? 
Even if Dr. Fauci wants to hide be-
hind the technicalities of the defini-
tions of gain of function, why couldn’t 
he with an ounce of humility—and even 
an ounce of humility—go before the 
Senate committee and say: Do you 
know what, Senator PAUL? I am trou-
bled by how much funding has been 
going into these research efforts at the 
Wuhan Institute. Do you know what, 
Dr. PAUL? I have got concerns because 
I didn’t know for sure what EcoHealth 
Alliance was doing. 
But here is the problem with that. An 
NIH spokesperson told Vanity Fair 
that Dr. Fauci was ‘‘entirely truthful’’ 
in his statements to Congress. 
Oh, thank you, NIH spokesperson. 
And that he did not have the progress 
report that detailed the controversial 
research at the time he testified in 
July. Okay, pause. 
At this point I would at least expect 
the good Dr. Fauci to have the humil-
ity to say: Hey, this is troubling. I 
don’t know that our research led to 
COVID–19, but I know that we have 
been funding now, I know now we have 
been funding research that is in the 
ZIP Code of gain of function. 
DARPA wouldn’t even do it. The ar-
rogance of this guy is that he is never 
going to admit that. He doesn’t want to 
admit that he is wrong. He doesn’t 
want to admit that NIH is neck-deep in 
this stuff because it is just straight up 
arrogance. That is why the American 
people have had it and they don’t be-
lieve him. They don’t believe NIH. 
But it goes on further. EcoHealth Al-
liance appeared to contradict that 
claim. It said in a statement: ‘‘These 
data were reported as soon as we were 
made aware, in our year 4 report in 
April 2018.’’ 
Now, let me be clear, as a former 
Federal prosecutor, I don’t know the 
facts. I don’t know if EcoHealth pre-
sented that data in 2018. We will look 
into it. That is my job here. But I can 
promise you one thing, Madam Speak-
er, my Democratic colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle aren’t going to 
look into it because they don’t care be-
cause this has never been about health. 
This has never been about truth. This 
has always been about power. 
Well, rather than just focusing on the 
NIH, why don’t we take a minute to 
focus on the CDC, another one of these 
august national health organizations 
to which we are supposed to bow down 
and say, please tell me what I must do 
for my own health and the well-being 
of my family? 
After facing backlash for saying the 
Federal Government was looking into a 
vaccine mandate, Centers for Disease 
Control Director Walensky took to 
Twitter to say that there would be no 
Federal vaccine mandate on July 30, 
2021. I guess President Biden didn’t get 
the memo? Oh. It is not a Federal vac-
cine mandate. I am just saying busi-
nesses or you are a contractor with the 
Federal Government, then you must do 
it if you have over 100 employees. 
Well, tell all that to my friends and 
the people around this country who are 
right now facing the decision of giving 
up their livelihood and not having a 
paycheck because they want to make 
the best decision for themselves or 
their families. 
My friend with MS who doesn’t want 
to get a jab and wants to teach is being 
told she cannot because President 
Biden and the Federal Government is 
holding Federal contracts over the 
head of a State university which is too 
gutless and cowardly to tell the Fed-
eral Government to pound sand. That 
State—a southern State—should be ab-
solutely ashamed of itself. That State 
should be telling the Federal Govern-
ment to go straight to you know 
where. 
The CDC takes an absurd all-or-noth-
ing approach to the vaccine. For exam-
ple, if a teenager recovers from a 
COVID–19 infection and is immune and 
this teenager receives one vaccine 
causing hospitalization for myocar-
ditis, the Centers for Disease Control 
suggests getting a second dose of the 
vaccine once the heart has recovered. 
Do you know what, Madam Speaker? 
The CDC director can go straight to 
hell. If that is my son or daughter, no 
way. No way. 
The CDC should be ashamed of itself 
for doing this, absolutely ashamed of 
itself. Go talk to the parents of those 
who have died. Go talk to the families 
of the moms who aren’t here. 
I am not sitting here suggesting that 
I know in my infinite wisdom what is 
best for every American in terms of 
getting a shot. I don’t know. I am not 
a doctor. But what I am is a Congress-
man, and a Representative who swore 
an oath to the Constitution of the 
United States that I would stand up to 
secure the blessings of liberty so that 
every American can make the decision 
for himself or herself as to whether or 
not they take any medicine. 
Again, never in the history of the 
United States have we had a Federal 
mandate from a President who doesn’t, 
frankly, know east from west come 
down here and tell us that we have got 
to take a shot. 
The CDC refuses to talk about nat-
ural immunity. 
Why? 
Why will the CDC not talk about nat-
ural immunity? 
In fact, they point to an inconclusive 
study that prompted the director to 
say: ‘‘If you have had COVID–19 before, 
please still get vaccinated.’’ 
There are at least 89 studies that af-
firm natural immunity is effective and 
long-lasting from a prior infection, yet 
our public health experts are uninter-
ested. I have to go to studies in Israel. 
I have to go look at studies in the 
United Kingdom in order to get facts 
about natural immunity. 
Now, why would that be? 
Surely it is not because anybody is 
self-interested or financially interested 
in how much these pharmaceutical 
companies are making throwing vac-
cines at every American. 
A U.K. office for national statistics 
report published Monday found those 
who catch the delta variant are around 
71 percent less likely to test positive 
again, 4 points higher than double vac-
cinated individuals. 
I am not saying you want to go catch 
the virus, Madam Speaker, but if you 
have had the virus, then you may not 
want to get the vaccine. And yet our 
scientists, scientists whom we now 
know to be less than truthful, refuse to 
acknowledge the benefits of natural 
immunity. 
What about the FDA? 
Can we trust the FDA? 
The FDA still has an image of a 
horse tagged with a web page saying: 
‘‘Why you should not use ivermectin to 
treat or prevent COVID–19.’’ 
Doctors have been denied ivermectin 
and have not been able to get access to 
this treatment which has proven effec-
tive, at least to some, in treating 
COVID. 
Again, what happened to right-to- 
try? 
What happened to the ability to go to 
the doctor of your choice, Madam 
Speaker? 
Dr. Pierre Kory conducted an anal-
ysis of randomized controlled treat-
ment trials of ivermectin used against 
COVID and found statistically signifi-
cant reductions of mortality. Our FDA 
and CDC are preventing patients from 
receiving ivermectin. Now, I got a pre-
scription for ivermectin. So did my 
wife. We each went to go get it filled. 
It is not horse medicine. I didn’t roll 
down to Tractor Supply Company, 
which I go to often, to go get supplies 
for the land on which I live. And, yes, 
I have seen the ivermectin in the cabi-
net at Tractor Supply Company. No, 
this was a prescription for pills of 
ivermectin that we wanted to have on 
supply in case we thought we needed it. 
So we go down to get it filled at a 
pharmacy, CVS, and the first time my 
wife went down there they whispered in 
the back. They said, oh, we can’t do 
that. We can’t fill that prescription. 
Well, finally one person came in and 
overrode and said, look, do they have a 
prescription? Oh, yeah. Well, then, go 
ahead and fill it.

So they filled the prescription. Then 
I go down to get the prescription filled 
that I got a few weeks later, and they 
wouldn’t fill it. I went to another phar-
macy, and they wouldn’t fill it. Fi-
nally, I went to a third one, and we got 
it filled. 
Why is that? Why is that? 
The FDA has delayed the Merck 
COVID–19 pill likely until 2022. Now, 
some of my research has shown people 
out there questioning why we need the 
Merck pill, and maybe this is just an-
other way to have another pharma-
ceutical company make a bunch of 
money on the back of COVID, but I 
also have a lot of smart doctors who 
are talking about the Merck pill as a 
potentially highly beneficial pill. 
Well, why can’t we just all agree to 
right-to-try? 
We are in the middle of a pandemic 
where people are getting sick, and indi-
viduals can’t go try this medicine be-
cause we are waiting on the FDA and 
all the geniuses to go through every 
possible scenario despite very positive 
returns on the initial tests? 
Remdesivir was so effective in its 
phase 3 randomized control trial that 
researchers stopped accepting new par-
ticipants, no COVID patient who re-
ceived the drug died compared with 
eight deaths in the placebo group. 
When a drug shows to work this well, it 
is considered unethical to continue to 
give sick subjects a placebo. The gov-
ernment has even prepurchased 1.7 mil-
lion treatment courses. The medication 
doesn’t even require refrigeration and 
it’s easy to ship. Yet practicing physi-
cians right now with patients who 
might die can’t give this drug to any 
sick patient because of regulatory bar-
riers. 
So we have mandates that you do 
stuff that may not even help in the 
slightest bit, Madam Speaker, and 
may, in fact, hurt you—mandates—and 
we have regulatory barriers preventing 
you from being able to figure out how 
to go take care of yourself or your 
loved ones. 
Again, I am not saying whether I 
think that drug is particularly effica-
cious or not. I don’t know. I am not a 
doctor. But what I am is someone who 
can read. What I am is someone who 
believes in freedom. And what I am is 
someone who believes, Madam Speak-
er, that you should be able to go to the 
doctor of your choice and make a deci-
sion for you and your family with the 
best information available and a right- 
to-try. 
What about HHS as a whole? 
Can we trust HHS? 
After watching all the debacle that 
has been NIH, Dr. Fauci, and gain-of- 
function research; after watching what 
we have seen with the CDC and refusal 
to look at natural immunity; after 
looking at what we have seen with re-
spect to the FDA and slow-walking 
drugs and access and hiding and obfus-
cating those drugs which may be bene-
ficial to people; how about the HHS 
now limiting the State of Texas’ abil-
ity to receive monoclonal antibody 
treatments? 
I was on a conference call with HHS 
leadership saying, why are you cutting 
our supply in half? 
Monoclonal antibody treatments are 
working. 
I said, tell me what—tell me, give me 
the amount that is currently in inven-
tory, give me the amount that can be 
produced on a weekly or a daily basis 
by the companies that can manufac-
ture it, and then tell me what you be-
lieve the demand is and why you are 
standing in the way of the orders that 
we are putting in in Texas to try to 
take care of our folks or Florida or any 
other State? 
They wouldn’t and couldn’t answer 
the question because it wasn’t about 
the math. I pressed them. I asked a sec-
ond question. I got back in queue on 
the whatever, Zoom call—or I think it 
was an audio conference call—I got 
back in and asked again, and they 
wouldn’t answer because it wasn’t 
about the math. It wasn’t about the 
numbers. It was about going after 
Texas and Florida and saying, you are 
not going to get monoclonal antibody 
treatments. 
b 1815 
The week of September 13, 2021, 
Texas received 23,640 doses. This week, 
Texas is receiving 11,400 doses, more 
than a 51 percent decrease. 
There is no reason for the Federal 
Government to be standing in the way 
of a State being able to work with 
their doctors to meet demand to save 
lives. The only reason is the power play 
of people who are absolutely so arro-
gantly full of their own views of the 
world that they want to press them 
upon the American people, as does Dr. 
Fauci, as does CDC Director Walensky, 
as does the leadership at the FDA, 
HHS, generally. 
These are the health experts, by the 
way, who also endorsed mass house ar-
rest of Americans by locking down, the 
lockdowns. Remember 15 days to slow 
the spread? What a joke. 
The lockdowns deteriorated people’s 
mental health and inflicted more dam-
age on women and girls. 
Among adolescents aged 12 to 17, the 
average number of visits to an emer-
gency room for suspected suicide at-
tempts was 22 percent higher during 
2020 and 39 percent higher during the 
winter of 2021 than the corresponding 
period the year before. During last win-
ter, emergency department visits for 
suspected suicide attempts were 50 per-
cent higher. 
Reporting also shows more than 
400,000 fewer child welfare concerns 
were reported. 
According to CDC data, overdose 
deaths killed a record number of Amer-
icans in 2020, almost 100,000 in 2020. 
Don’t get me started on the border. 
Don’t get me started on fentanyl. Don’t 
get me started on the incompetence of 
an administration that would allow 
people to get abused in the name of 
open borders, saying that it is some-
how compassionate while little girls 
get sold into the sex trafficking trade 
and fentanyl pours into our commu-
nities and into the lives of our loved 
ones and our young people who are 
dying by the thousands. 
Don’t get me started about the em-
powered cartels. Don’t get me started 
about the ranches getting overrun, the 
people getting abused, the dead bodies 
of migrants in south Texas. 
It is all the same thing, and it is all 
the same power play by a Federal Gov-
ernment led by a President who wants 
to give lip service to doing something 
to help this country while playing 
woke politics and allowing the Amer-
ican people to get abused and harmed 
in the process. 
Just as we have seen unfold in 
Loudoun County when a little girl, a 
ninth-grader, gets raped in a bathroom, 
and the father, upset, goes to the 
school board meeting and in the school 
board meeting dares to speak up and 
then is dragged down, bloodied, ar-
rested because he was there to defend 
his little girl who got raped by a boy 
wearing a skirt in the bathroom of the 
high school he sent her to to get edu-
cated. 
Then that school board, sweeping 
this all aside in the name of wokeness 
and political correctness, what do they 
do? They ignore it, and then he be-
comes the poster child for so-called do-
mestic terrorism. 
Then what happens? Another little 
girl gets abused by the same boy at a 
different high school in that district in 
Loudoun 
County, 
Virginia. 
Leftist 
wokeism running our schools with Vir-
ginia Democrats allowing it to happen 
because that is what is happening 
every single day in the Commonwealth 
of Virginia in Loudoun County. 
This is the state of our country at 
the moment, bowing down to the altar 
of woke politics; of the power hungry, 
the elite who think they know what is 
best for you, the same people who walk 
in and say: Parents don’t have a role in 
the classroom. Parents don’t have a 
role in the schools. Parents don’t have 
a say in what is going to be decided in 
the school boards. 
Nothing could be more un-American. 
Nothing could be undermining the fu-
ture of this country more than to sepa-
rate parents from the education of 
their children. 
Nothing could do more damage to our 
country than undermining faith in in-
stitutions because so-called medical 
professional experts are telling lies, 
distorting the truth; refusing to be 
humble, to come forward and say they 
don’t know the answer; to be honest 
about what taxpayer dollars are going 
to fund, what kind of research in 
China; having the slightest bit of hu-
mility to say maybe we don’t know all 
the answers, maybe we should allow 
parents, doctors, families to make de-
cisions that are in the best interests of 
their children, the best interests of 
themselves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5927 
October 26, 2021 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, we have 
to make a decision about what we are 
going to do to carry this country for-
ward. We have to decide whether or not 
we are going to give people informa-
tion that they can believe in and trust 
and make sure that the institutions 
that are running this country, that are 
providing information for this country, 
can be relied upon. 
The American people are waking up. 
The American people are waking up to 
the lies and the distortions that have 
been shoved into their faces by the 
media, by the schools, and by the very 
people who are supposed to be running 
our national healthcare institutions 
and providing information that you 
can rely upon. 
The American people are waking up, 
and they are taking back their coun-
try. And the response shouldn’t be, as 
it was from the Attorney General of 
the United States, to send the FBI in 
to go after parents in school boards. 
The response shouldn’t be to sweep 
aside the concerns of a mom who wants 
to teach and has MS and doesn’t want 
to get a vaccine and then has to choose 
and might get fired. 
That should not be the response of a 
competent and respectful government. 
That should not be the response of a 
government that is limited in power 
and is supposed to derive its power 
from the consent of the governed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
f 
VISION FOR AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
guess the major topic of the week, and 
should be the major topic of the week, 
is the infrastructure bill—I am sorry, 
the reconciliation bill. 
It is tempting when talking about 
the reconciliation bill to just talk 
about the huge amount of spending 
which inevitably is going to be paid for 
by the Federal Reserve printing more 
money and is inevitably going to result 
in an increase in inflation, be it in 
housing, be it in food, or, in addition to 
housing and food, be it in energy costs. 
I hope the American public realizes 
what is going on and they are prepared 
to pay, at least in the northern part of 
the country, their heating bills that 
are going to arrive in December and 
January or February because it is 
going to be a shocker. 
But I am a little bit afraid, as we 
spend so much time focusing on the in-
evitable 
inflation, 
we 
don’t 
talk 
enough about the way that the authors 
of this bill want to permanently 
change America, I feel, for the worst. 
First of all, they want a lot more in-
trusive government. In this bill, we 
have a provision for hiring over 80,000 
IRS agents. 
In Wisconsin, when I think of 80,000, 
I think of our big stadiums where the 
University of Wisconsin plays. I think 
it is more than you would fit in the 
stadium where the Green Bay Packers 
play. And I think, who would want to 
hire this many government agents to 
monitor the American citizens? 
It is kind of a scary thing. What vi-
sion for America do we have here? 
We just got done, outside of the in-
frastructure bill, the Biden administra-
tion, trying to monitor transfers of $600 
from account to account. Why would 
you do that? 
I mean, I can only imagine we want 
to monitor what charities you give 
money to, what politicians you want to 
give money to. You want to monitor if 
it is the type of church that maybe 
isn’t favored by the current adminis-
tration. 
Now, finally, they knocked that back 
up to $10,000, but you can see the type 
of country that this administration 
wants. 
At a time when, whether you are in 
construction, whether you are in man-
ufacturing, whether you are in the 
service 
industries, 
everybody 
is 
screaming for more people to work, not 
only are we going to take 80,000 people 
out of the work pool and have them 
work for the government monitoring 
their fellow citizens, we have a new ci-
vilian climate corps, again, to take 
people out of the workforce, not have 
them working for, I guess I would say, 
the more productive segments of soci-
ety but, instead, a new program. 
We have free community college. 
Now, I am somebody who is in favor of 
technical school. I am as big a fan of 
technical schools as there is. But when 
you give something away for free, you 
are, in essence, telling the 19- and 20- 
year-olds that you ought to spend time 
taking this thing for free and maybe do 
that instead of working, maybe do that 
instead of joining the military, maybe 
do that instead of getting a job where 
the employer trains you to do some-
thing or other. 
It is another shift in the power that 
the government has in our country. 
The next area that I think there is 
going to be a big change is you want to 
get parents out of their children’s 
lives. I particularly don’t like the idea 
of having the government care for all 3- 
and 4-year-olds. 
First of all, it is not effective. Stud-
ies will show that you can teach a 3- 
year-old to read or a 5-year-old to read 
but, either way, by the time they are 8 
or 9, they are all the same. 
We do have a problem on inter-
national test scores with other coun-
tries, but the problem isn’t that our 
kids are not doing a good job of learn-
ing when they are 4 or 5 going into ele-
mentary school. Our test scores com-
pared to other countries are actually 
very good for fourth graders. It is in 
middle school that our students fall be-
hind other countries. 
In other words, it is kind of we are in 
worse and worse shape the more time 
we spend in the schools. 
But in any event, I don’t like the 
idea of the government taking care of 
3- or 4-year-olds. Right now, there are 
still many stay-at-home parents. Not 
only that, even when parents don’t 
stay home, a lot of times kids stay 
with their grandparents or other rel-
atives. This is a big shift in saying the 
government should take care of the 3- 
and 4-year-olds. 
In part, I think, given what we have 
seen in the rest of this bill, one of the 
reasons the government wants to take 
care of these kids is to instill govern-
ment values in those children, which is 
not something that we want. 
The next thing about the bill that I 
think is a shift that we won’t like is we 
started off this session talking a little 
bit about Black Lives Matter and 
things they had that they took off 
their website in which they don’t like 
an old-fashioned family. 
But right now, most income transfer 
payments or welfare payments are 
based on a certain definition of poverty 
in which it is very difficult to get this 
money if you are married, particularly 
if you are married to someone who has 
an income. 
It seems, in this bill, we are going to 
put more money into programs in 
which you cannot get that money un-
less you are not working full time and 
certainly very difficult to get that 
money if you are married to somebody. 
So, in other words, it is a disincentive 
to be part of an old-fashioned nuclear 
family. 
I quote here from the Black Lives 
Matter website that was taken down: 
We disrupt the Western-prescribed nu-
clear family structure. So that is not 
what they want. And, therefore, it is 
not surprising that we are putting a lot 
more money into programs conditioned 
upon adapting a lifestyle other than 
the traditional nuclear family. 
Recently, outside of the bill, Presi-
dent Biden upped the amount of money 
going into the food stamp program. 
Right now in America, if you looked at 
the difference between 2006 and 2018, 
both years in which the economy was 
going very well, the number of people 
on food stamps in this country in-
creased by 40 percent. 
I mean, I would think the goal of an 
antipoverty program would be to get 
less people in poverty. But, instead, in 
that 12-year period, a strong economy 
in 2006, a strong economy in 2018, we 
have a 40 percent increase in the num-
ber of people on food stamps, which 
means, I think, that the people who de-
sign the program are successful by 
their own measurement. They are get-
ting more and more people not to work 
full time, and they are getting more 
and more people not to live in a tradi-
tional nuclear family structure.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5928 
October 26, 2021 
In this program, there is a lot of 
money for low-income housing. Low-in-
come housing is one of those programs 
that, again, it is fine if it is for the el-
derly and disabled. But of course, oth-
erwise, it is one of these programs that 
is designed for people living there if 
they aren’t part of a nuclear family. I 
think it is a mistake to put another 
program along those lines. 
It is very easy to find situations in 
which people would lose $20,000, over 
$20,000 a year, if they got married to 
someone who did have a job. 
There was an author, an English au-
thor that I like to quote, talking about 
the problem of the welfare system in 
England. I think there the system was 
more expansive than even here in the 
United States. When he looked at the 
dysfunction of the British families in 
the 1990s and early 2000s, he looked at 
the British system and said there was 
almost nothing you could do that 
would deprive you of the right to get 
free housing, free food, and medical 
care. 
In other words, you could live a com-
pletely irresponsible life if you wanted 
to. Of course, an irresponsible life fre-
quently means being not the best par-
ent. It can mean, obviously, not work-
ing, so being a bad role model in that 
way, and spending time doing things 
like drugs and such—in other words, 
living a lifestyle that is not advisable. 
b 1830 
But between getting rid of the work 
requirements for food stamps in this 
bill, between the massive increases in 
low-income housing—and I will point 
out, a lot of times this low-income 
housing, at least in Wisconsin, is better 
off than the housing that is not low-in-
come housing, as far as rental units are 
concerned—you are going to further 
incentivize a certain lifestyle and fur-
ther discourage the nuclear family. 
I will give you the exact numbers 
here so you can check. In 2006, we had 
26 million people on food stamps. In 
2019, we had 36 million people. I realize 
that there are people that go through a 
tough time. I have no problem helping 
out people going through a tough time. 
But when you have a 40 percent in-
crease in a 13-year period, it is time to 
step back and look and see whether 
your programs are accomplishing what 
you want to accomplish. Maybe if you 
want more people living the welfare 
lifestyle, you are getting what you 
want. 
The next area that I would like to 
look at is what type of vision you have 
for America as far as future Americans. 
Here, we look at our southern border, 
clearly another way in which this ad-
ministration is even dramatically dif-
ferent than, I would say, the Obama ad-
ministration. 
In this bill, first of all, we have mass 
amnesty, which, in addition to being 
wrong, because you are having people 
who kind of skip the line to come in 
here ahead of people who are coming 
here appropriately, it is a problem in 
that you are getting people to come in 
this country who we do not know what 
the background is. We want people in 
this country who are hardworking. We 
want people who are law-abiding. 
When you put such a massive carrot 
out there that you are encouraging 
people to come into the country, re-
gardless of being appropriately vetted, 
you are going to inevitably make a big 
step towards destroying America. 
Another provision, in addition to the 
mass amnesty, in the bill that I think 
shows a green light, encouraging peo-
ple from other countries to come here, 
is they in this bill specifically give free 
college, via Pell grants, to illegal im-
migrants. I mean, if you want to send 
the message to people in other coun-
tries we want you to come here by 
obeying the law, by waiting in line, by 
filling out the forms, why in the world 
would you put a program in saying if 
you come here illegally you get free 
college. But that is another one of the 
interesting provisions in this bill. 
I will point out one more time. Last 
time I was at the border, you could 
look at all the identification cards of 
people coming across strewn on the 
ground before they checked in with the 
Border Patrol. Why do people get rid of 
their identification cards before they 
check in with the Border Patrol? Be-
cause they don’t want people checking 
into their background. So to quote 
President Trump: ‘‘They are not send-
ing their best.’’ 
The only thing not in this bill is, mi-
raculously, there is no more money for 
the Border Patrol. So at a time where 
we can come up with $3.5 trillion, one 
of the very few places we need to spend 
more money in this country, there is 
no more money for the Border Patrol. 
The next area that I think shows the 
type of change that this administra-
tion envisions is, again and again and 
again, we focus on equity. We look at 
people by where their ancestors came 
from or that sort of thing. Again and 
again, whether it is education pro-
grams, whether it is security programs, 
whether it is tuition assistance pro-
grams, we are going to keep track of 
people by race and religion and sexual 
orientation. We are not going to judge 
people as individuals. 
One of the reasons I feel that other 
countries fail, that are based on elec-
tions, is these countries view elections 
as contests between different ethnic 
groups. Whether you read about elec-
tions in the Middle East or read about 
elections in Africa, the elections are 
contests between different tribes, dif-
ferent ethnic groups. When you go to 
the polls, you don’t say how much 
should we spend on defense or how 
much should we spend on transpor-
tation or what should our policy be on 
pro-life issues. You go in and vote for 
your tribe. 
That is clearly the type of America 
that this administration wants. They 
want people identified by an ethnic 
background, and we will decide wheth-
er or not you are promoted or get a 
grant or what-have-you based on eth-
nic background. 
It is a dangerous change in the way 
America has traditionally been. In 
America, it was always supposed to be 
e pluribus unum. But, instead, we have 
a new vision, which is a very dangerous 
vision for America. Quite frankly, if we 
go down this path, this is another way 
in which America is going to be ruined. 
So I want Americans, as they follow 
what is going on here, to ask them-
selves: 
Do we really have a problem that we 
need the government raising a lot more 
of the children? 
Do we really have a problem in which 
we have to dole out benefits based on 
where your great-great-grandparents 
lived rather than based on individuals? 
Do we really have to change this 
country so that everybody can come 
here from around the world and be 
given free benefits, rather than doing it 
like we do traditionally, where you get 
in line, fill out the forms, and we know 
that the new Americans we are getting 
are law-abiding and hardworking? 
Do we really want a new country in 
which government surveillance is such 
a bigger part of our fabric, 87,000 new 
IRS agents poking around, seeing what 
you are doing in your life? It got beat-
en back now, but you know it is going 
to be back in the future, going all the 
way down into looking at every $600 
check and wondering whether you are 
sending it somewhere that the govern-
ment would approve. 
Of course, outside of the bill, we al-
ready have the problem we have with 
our technology websites in which we 
already are monitoring what you are 
permitted to read and monitoring what 
you are permitted to put on your 
website. 
It is a brave new world for America, 
and the American public had better 
wake up. Because unless you want a 
fundamentally different America than 
the America I grew up in, in any event, 
you are going to get a different Amer-
ica unless you fight to keep what we 
have traditionally had. 
I think in addition to the outlandish 
spending levels of this bill, you ought 
to be looking at exactly where that 
spending is going. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, show favor to our land 
and bless us with Your grace. Guide our 
lawmakers so that they will strive for 
complete honesty in their work for lib-
erty. 
Lord, empower them to give and not

LEADER

pore. The majority leader is recog-

f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Well, Mr. President, 
today is going to be a busy day on the 
floor of the Senate. Last week, I filed 
cloture on five of President Biden’s 
nominees to serve as U.S. district 
judges, and today, we are going to 
begin working on these nominees. 
Even as Senate Democrats proceed 
on our agenda to help working and 
middle-class families and tackle the 
climate crisis, we will not relent on 
speedily filling the vacancies in our 
Federal judiciary with qualified, main-
stream, and diverse jurists. 
Yesterday, we took a big step for-
ward towards achieving that goal by 
confirming Myrna Perez to serve on 
the Second Circuit, one of the most im-
portant courts in the land, and the 
judges we will begin considering today 
continue that effort: more civil rights 
lawyers, more diverse candidates, more 
Federal defenders. 
To date, the Senate has now con-
firmed 13 nominees to serve on our dis-
trict courts, with 20 overall lifetime 
appointments to the Federal bench. 
Many of these individuals are knocking 
down longstanding barriers to the halls 
of justice: the first Native American 
judge, the first Muslim-American dis-
trict judge. And among all of the Presi-
dent’s nominees to date, over half— 
over half—are women. We are proud of 
that. 
In a broader sense, President Biden’s 
judicial nominees are also expanding 
and rewriting the rules of who merits 
consideration for the bench. Our Fed-
eral courts have long been presided 
over by former corporate lawyers and 
prosecutors and men. To be sure, many 
of these individuals have served admi-
rably as judges, and I have been proud 
to support many of them over the 
years. But our Federal judges, more 
than ever—more than ever—are an es-
sential component of our democracy, 
and they should better reflect the rich-
ness and diversity of our Nation—not 
just demographic and cultural diver-
sity, as important as that is, but pro-
fessional diversity, too. 
We need more judges who know what 
it is like to defend people who nor-
mally can’t afford attorneys. We need 
more judges who have fought for those 
who have faced discrimination in the 
workplace or because of the color of 
their skin. We need more judges who 
understand the economic hardship that 
so many people have and when they are 
forced to sign documents and other 
things that will hurt them economi-
cally. And we need judges who have 
been in the fight against these efforts— 
stronger than they have ever been, un-
fortunately—to undermine our democ-
racy. 
We need our Federal bench, in other 
words, to mirror our country as a 
whole. That is how we restore balance 
to the bench and strengthen people’s 
trust in the Federal judiciary. 
So, as a Democratic majority, we are 
going to keep working this week to 
make sure these nominees are con-
firmed by this Chamber. I hope both 
sides can work in good faith to move 
the process along quickly and in a bi-
partisan fashion. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER PLAN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on Build Back Better, this week, 
Democrats are continuing to make im-
portant 
progress 
toward 
finalizing 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
plan, and we remain confident that a 
final deal is within reach.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7350 
October 26, 2021 
When Democrats first set out to pass 
historic legislation to boost our econ-
omy and invest in everyday Americans, 
we knew that the task wouldn’t be 
easy. The challenges that our country 
faces are manifold and they are se-
vere—from the hardship of raising a 
family to securing a good-paying job, 
to affording something as basic as 
healthcare and the cost of prescription 
drugs. 
Tackling these issues head-on was 
sure to be an immense challenge. Doing 
big things in Congress is always hard. 
But we didn’t choose elected office just 
to pursue the easy things. We came 
here to do the hard things, the impor-
tant things, the things that will im-
pact Americans—working-class Ameri-
cans, middle-class Americans, those 
struggling to get into the middle class 
and those struggling to stay there— 
that will impact those people for gen-
erations. 
That is what these negotiations have 
been about: doing the hard work to de-
liver something big for the American 
people. 
Nobody—nobody—is going to get ev-
erything they want, but we all know 
we need to keep our promise to the 
American people. 
We need to tackle the climate crisis 
head-on, and the programs we are try-
ing to enact will empower us to meet 
the President’s emission goals. 
We need to help working parents and 
give every child in America a chance to 
succeed in school and in life, and pro-
grams being discussed will help im-
prove countless of lives. 
And we need, I believe, to strengthen 
vital services, like Medicare—relied on 
by millions of Americans—and to make 
healthcare more affordable. I believe 
this is so important, and we are work-
ing to get it done. 
Democrats will continue fighting 
until we are able to pass this trans-
formational legislation. The progress 
of last week illustrated how, if we stick 
together, work towards finding that 
legislative sweet spot, then we can suc-
ceed. 
That is worth a few hard days. In 
fact, it is worth many hard days. We 
have some more work to do, but we re-
main committed to forging ahead until 
we reward the trust the American peo-
ple have placed in us. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 1.7 
million people, that is the record-shat-
tering number of illegal immigrants 
detained along our southern border in 
just the last 12 months. In 1 year, 1.7 
million people tried to take advantage 
of the Biden administration’s inten-
tionally unsecure border and come here 
illegally. This is the most ever re-
corded. 
There are 11 States whose popu-
lations are smaller than 1.7 million. Of 
the 1.7 million, more than 1 million 
were single adults. That is nearly two- 
thirds—not family units, not unaccom-
panied children, but adults on their 
own. 
In many cases, this is not about es-
caping disaster or persecution; this is 
about wanting a better job in America. 
It is less about emergency refugees and 
more about economics. Legal immigra-
tion in pursuit of a better future is a 
core part of our country. It reflects our 
values, and it makes us stronger. 
We are a generous country that 
wants 
to 
welcome 
ambitious 
new 
Americans who come here the right 
way. But it is beyond disingenuous for 
the Biden administration to pretend 
that huge numbers of people who sim-
ply want better jobs are emergency ref-
ugees. Those are two entirely different 
things. 
In this 12-month span, authorities ar-
rested people from 160 different coun-
tries. In this 12-month span, authori-
ties arrested people from 160 different 
countries. 
Think about that. The U.S. recog-
nizes 195 countries in the entire world. 
Customs and Border Protection ran 
into people from all but 35 of the entire 
number of countries in the world. 
On numerous occasions, these people 
have told reporters they are coming 
specifically—specifically—because 
of 
President Biden. His campaign rhetoric 
and his policy decisions have directly— 
directly—created this crisis. 
Late last December, about a month 
before the President took office, he lit-
erally said ‘‘the last thing we need’’ 
would be if his administration pursued 
policy changes that caused us to ‘‘end 
up with 2 million people on our bor-
der.’’ 
That was the President last Decem-
ber. That is how President-elect Biden 
himself defined failure on our border 
last December: 2 million people show-
ing up. 
Well, that is exactly what he has 
brought about, all because of the lib-
eral misapprehension that a weak and 
porous border is a compassionate bor-
der. It is not. 
Even now, even as President Biden 
faces the exact definition of failure, 
which he himself laid out, the adminis-
tration won’t change course. A few 
weeks ago, Secretary Mayorkas re-
leased radical new guidance that essen-
tially tries to create amnesty by execu-
tive fiat. 
This Mayorkas memo told ICE that, 
now, being in the country illegally 
‘‘should not alone be the basis’’ for 
making arrests—a baseline policy of no 
enforcement, with exceptions for cer-
tain extenuating circumstances. 
Last week, before the Judiciary Com-
mittee, under questioning from Sen-
ator CORNYN, even the President’s own 
nominee to CBP had to admit that non-
enforcement policies are a magnet that 
make the problem worse. 
Even 
before 
the 
new 
Mayorkas 
memo, over the whole last 12 months, 
immigration arrests in the interior of 
the country fell—fell—to their lowest 
level in more than a decade. ICE ar-
rested half as many people this past 
year as they did on average in previous 
years. 
Put two and two together: CBP en-
counters at the border are at historic 
highs, but ICE enforcement is down to 
a decade low—encounters at the border 
at a historic high, but enforcement 
down to a decade low. 
This doesn’t make any sense, unless 
we are looking at functional amnesty 
through nonenforcement. 
But even now, Democrats keep push-
ing more new policies to incentivize il-
legal immigration. Their next reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree proposes to 
double 
down 
on 
Democrats’ 
new 
monthly welfare deposits that can flow 
directly to people who are here ille-
gally. This is a Democrat-created crisis 
from top to bottom. 
f 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on another matter. On the whole, 
the 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
the 
Democrats want to ram through will 
hurt families and help China. But when 
you take a close look, there are some 
special groups of people here at home 
who would make out like bandits. 
There are specific special interests 
that Democrats take great pains to 
look after. 
Let me give you an example. A whole 
chunk of money the Democrats’ pro-
posal supposedly sets aside for patient 
healthcare 
would 
actually 
finance 
ultragenerous benefits for members of 
the powerful leftwing union, the SEIU. 
The Big Labor bonanza doesn’t stop 
there. Democrats’ tax plans would 
allow the expiration of Americans’ 
above-the-line deduction for charitable 
and nonprofit donations. But in its 
place, they want to create a brandnew 
subsidy for—listen to this—union dues. 
Tough luck for the Red Cross and your 
church collection plate; Washington 
Democrats say Big Labor bosses come 
first. 
Democrats also propose lavishing bil-
lions of dollars on something they call 
environmental 
and 
climate 
justice 
block grants—environmental and cli-
mate justice block grants. That sounds 
like a gift-wrapped giveaway to the 
universe of nonprofits and activist 
groups that seemingly exist to grift off 
of government grants. 
They would spend billions more on 
tax credits to subsidize luxury pur-
chases that are overwhelmingly made

by wealthy people, like electric cars 
and $8,000 electric bicycles. 
Then there are billions more in spe-
cial subsidies and loans for the next 
generation of Solyndras. 
The gravy train doesn’t stop there. 
When the Biden administration pro-
posed spending $40 billion on public 
housing renovations, the senior Sen-
ator from New York urged them to 
double down and spend $40 billion ex-
clusively 
on 
his 
hometown—exclu-
sively on his hometown. That is $40 bil-
lion to a housing authority that is ap-
parently well known for bribery and 
mismanagement simply because the 
Democratic leader requested it. 
Meanwhile, 
in 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s 
backyard of San Francisco, the elite 
trustees of a massive park and develop-
ment project—oh, boy, they are licking 
their chops. The Speaker plans to set 
aside $200 million of the spending spree 
for this park that is specifically not 
meant to receive taxpayer money, so 
they can focus on ‘‘environmental and 
social justice.’’ 
The Democrats’ spree would also tear 
down longstanding, bipartisan Hyde 
amendment protections so they can di-
rectly fund abortion providers like 
Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dol-
lars. Today’s left cannot miss an oppor-
tunity to send Planned Parenthood a 
new slush fund. 
Then there is the Democrats’ obses-
sion with the so-called SALT cap. Even 
as our colleagues draft the biggest tax 
hikes in half a century, they cannot re-
sist the concept of special tax cuts for 
high earners in blue States. They want 
to reintroduce the Federal tax subsidy 
for living in high-tax States. One out-
side analysis found that a 2-year repeal 
of the SALT cap would send more 
than—listen to this—more than $300,000 
to the average household in the top 0.1 
percent of our country. The average 
household in the bottom 60 percent 
would get $15. This isn’t a joke; this is 
literally the SALT policy that Demo-
crats want—300 grand for the richest 
folks on the coast and 15 bucks for nor-
mal families. 
It is the same setup everywhere you 
look. Special interests who are con-
nected to the Democratic Party would 
make out like bandits, and middle- 
class families, they will get the bill.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have 
good news. This week, the U.S. Senate 
is going to consider five highly quali-
fied Federal district court nominees. 
Before 
briefly 
speaking 
on 
their 
records, I want to make a few broad ob-
servations. 
First, each of these nominations was 
recommended by the White House, by 
their home State Senators, or, in the 
case of the D.C. District Court, by Dis-
trict of Columbia Representative ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON. I want to com-
mend my colleagues—they did their 
job. They continued to identify and 
recommend nominees who have the ex-
perience and the temperament needed 
to serve on the Federal bench. 
Second, these nominees represent an 
important cross-section of professional 
diversity. They have served as public 
defenders. They have also been pros-
ecutors, civil rights attorneys, munic-
ipal lawyers, and even sitting judges. 
Third, all five of these nominees re-
ceived bipartisan support in the Judici-
ary Committee. How about that, bipar-
tisan support in the committee. That is 
a testament to their abilities, quali-
fications, and character. I thank my 
Republican colleagues who made that 
possible. 
Finally, these nominees understand 
the limited role a judge plays in our ju-
dicial system. They have to be guided 
by evenhandedness, impartiality, and 
fidelity to the rule of law. We have 
seen that in their records. These 
records have been scrupulously re-
viewed by staff on both sides—Demo-
crat, Republican, in addition to the 
White House, obviously. We have seen 
it in their testimony before the Judici-
ary Committee, and we have seen it in 
the broad support they had from the 
legal communities where they live. 
Let me tell you a bit about each of 
them. 
First is Jia Cobb, nominated to the 
District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia. Ms. Cobb has more than 15 
years of experience as a trial litigator. 
She has tried more than 30 cases to 
verdict in both civil and criminal 
cases. This depth of experience is one 
of the reasons she was rated unani-
mously—unanimously—‘‘well 
quali-
fied’’ by the American Bar Association. 
For nearly a decade, she has rep-
resented people seeking to uphold their 
rights when it comes to the Nation’s 
housing, disability, and employment 
discrimination laws. 
Critically, Ms. Cobb understands the 
distinction between being an advocate 
and a judge. As a judge on the District 
of D.C., she has promised to rule based 
on the law and facts of the cases before 
her. 
Next is Judge Karen Williams, nomi-
nated to the District of New Jersey. 
Like Ms. Cobb, Judge Williams was 
unanimously rated ‘‘well qualified’’ by 
the ABA. That is a testament to her in-
tegrity, temperament, and experience, 
which includes 12 years as a Federal 
magistrate judge and another two dec-
ades as a practicing litigator. 
She has the strong support of both 
Senators from New Jersey, MENENDEZ 
and BOOKER, and many throughout the 
New Jersey legal community. 
We will also be voting this week on 
the nomination of Patricia Giles to the 
Eastern District of Virginia. Ms. Giles 
has a deep understanding of the dis-
trict which she has been nominated to 
serve. As a Federal prosecutor, she 
tried more than 20 cases to verdict, and 
prosecutors and defense counsel alike 
have praised her fairness and her te-
nacity. 
Ms. Giles also received a unanimous 
‘‘well qualified’’ rating from the Amer-
ican Bar Association and has the 
strong support of her Senators, WAR-
NER and KAINE. 
The Senate will consider Judge Mi-
chael Nachmanoff, nominated to the 
Eastern District of Virginia. He has 
served as a Federal magistrate judge 
since 2015, following an accomplished 
career as the district’s appointed Fed-
eral defender. 
Judge Nachmanoff also received a 
unanimous 
‘‘well 
qualified’’ 
rating 
from the ABA. He has the strong sup-
port of both Virginia Senators. Like 
Ms. Giles, Judge Nachmanoff received 
praise from prosecutors and defense at-
torneys alike. It is a testament to his 
integrity and evenhandedness. 
Finally, the Senate is going to con-
sider Sarala Nagala, nominated to the 
District of Connecticut bench. Ms. 
Nagala is an accomplished Federal 
prosecutor. She has devoted her career 
to very serious cases involving human 
trafficking, child exploitation, identity 
theft, hate crimes, and fraud. 
Like each of the nominees, she re-
ceived a unanimous rating of ‘‘well 
qualified’’ from the ABA and has 
strong 
support 
from 
Senators 
BLUMENTHAL and MURPHY. 
I ask all my colleagues to join me in 
supporting these five extremely high- 
qualified nominees. With their record, 
experience, and evenhanded approach, 
they will be ready on day one to serve 
in the critically important role of dis-
trict court judge. 
Finally, let me say that for many of 
these people, this decision to move for-
ward and ask for appointment to the 
Federal judiciary carries with it status 
and admiration from many people— 
most people—but it also may mean 
some personal sacrifices. They are now 
going to be officially in public life, and 
that brings with it, as we all know, 
some burdens. They are willing to ac-
cept that and their families are willing 
to accept it as they continue to serve 
as Federal judges.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7352 
October 26, 2021 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
approving them. I hope it is done this 
week in a timely manner. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, Demo-
crats continue to negotiate with each 
other on their reckless tax-and-spend-
ing spree. Democrats are currently 
working to lower the bill’s top-line 
number in an effort to meet some of 
the demands of the few moderate 
Democrats 
who 
have 
reservations 
about unchecked government spending. 
Now, you might think that lowering 
the top-line number would involve de-
ciding what programs and spending to 
eliminate to bring the bill in at a lower 
cost. Well, not exactly. Yes, Democrats 
are reportedly eliminating some spend-
ing, but the word is that, under pres-
sure from progressives, who are dead 
set against curtailing their plans for 
expanding government, Democrats are 
planning to keep a lot of their most ex-
pensive proposals, but simply shorten 
the funding window to make the costs 
of these programs seem lower. 
Take Democrats’ fantastically expen-
sive child allowance. Democrats have 
every intention of turning their child 
allowance into a permanent govern-
ment welfare program, but in order to 
bring the top-line number of their 
spending bill down, the word is that 
Democrats are now planning to offi-
cially extend the allowance for just 1 
year. 
This is, in fact, a budget gimmick on 
top of a budget gimmick, as Democrats 
were already attempting to disguise 
the true cost of the child allowance by 
officially extending it for just 4 of the 
10 years in the bill’s 10-year budget 
window. 
They were never, of course, planning 
to eliminate the child allowance after 4 
years, and they are certainly not plan-
ning to eliminate it now after 1 year, 
but by officially extending it for just a 
year in their tax-and-spending spree, 
they can manage to make the program 
look as if it will cost hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars less than it will actu-
ally cost. 
And they are apparently repeating 
this strategy with a number of their 
other spending measures. 
That paid leave program? Appar-
ently, the White House has proposed a 
smaller version that would supposedly 
expire after 3 or 4 years. 
Those childcare subsidies? Appar-
ently, those may also now, ostensibly, 
expire. 
The ObamaCare subsidies Democrats 
want to extend permanently? Well, 
once again, it sounds like they are 
going to try shrinking the apparent 
cost with a short-term extension. 
But, again, let’s be very clear here. 
These short-term extensions and short- 
term programs are nothing more than 
a budget gimmick to disguise the true 
cost of the Democrats’ plan. There 
isn’t one program that I have named 
that Democrats don’t fully intend to 
make permanent. 
Don’t believe me? Just ask the Con-
gressional Progressive Caucus, which 
outlined the strategy the Democrats 
are currently adopting in a letter to 
Speaker PELOSI. 
I quote from that letter: 
If given a choice between legislating nar-
rowly or broadly— 
the caucus wrote— 
—we strongly encourage you to choose the 
latter, and make robust investments over a 
shorter window . . . This will help make the 
case for our party’s ability to govern, and es-
tablish a track record of success that will 
pave the way for a long-term extension of 
benefits. 
So the plan is to make these pro-
grams permanent and to permanently 
and massively expand the size of gov-
ernment. Democrats hope to get Amer-
icans hooked on the government bene-
fits they are offering while hiding the 
true costs of those benefits from the 
American people until it is too late. 
Frankly, it is not a bad strategy if 
your aim is to permanently expand the 
size of government because the truth is 
it is pretty hard to eradicate even the 
most inefficient and ineffective Federal 
program once it has been put into 
place. 
As Ronald Reagan used to say, the 
nearest thing to eternal life that we 
will ever see on this earth is a govern-
ment program. 
That, of course, is what the Demo-
crats are counting on. They believe 
that, once they put these programs in 
place, no one from either party will be 
able to get rid of them. 
What is less clear is how Democrats 
believe these programs are going to be 
funded in the long term, if, in fact, 
they have given any thought to that 
issue at all. I wouldn’t be surprised if 
they haven’t. 
It is important to note that the 
short-term programs and program ex-
tensions in the Democrats’ tax-and- 
spending spree will be paid for by 10 
years of taxes. That is right. It will 
take 10 years of taxes and other rev-
enue-raising measures to pay for pro-
grams that are scheduled to last as lit-
tle as 1 year. 
So what happens when Democrats 
want to extend that child allowance 
again 
next 
year 
or 
extend 
those 
childcare subsidies for the long term? 
Well, that is a really good question, 
and one for which I would love to hear 
the Democrats’ answer. 
Are Democrats going to trot out 
more tax hikes to pay for extending 
the child allowance or making the 
childcare subsidies permanent? Or are 
they going to just suggest that we add 
hundreds of billions—and eventually 
trillions—to our already dangerously 
large national debt? And, if they opt 
for tax hikes, just who is going to be 
facing those tax hikes? 
The Democrats are eventually going 
to run out of money from millionaires 
and billionaires, and then they are 
going to start coming after the wallets 
of the middle class. 
Of course, when I say that the pro-
grams in the Democrats’ tax-and- 
spending spree will be paid for with 10 
years of taxes, I mean that Democrats 
are 
claiming—claiming—that 
those 
programs will be paid for, because it is 
by no means clear that Democrats’ tax 
hikes and revenue-raising measures 
will actually result in the revenue they 
are claiming. 
Democrats, for example, are claiming 
that their proposal to increase IRS en-
forcement measures, including a new 
requirement that would allow the IRS 
to look into the details of Americans’ 
spending, will allow them to collect 
$700 billion in revenue; but the Con-
gressional Budget Office hasn’t con-
firmed that estimate, and there is sub-
stantial reason to doubt that Demo-
crats will be able to collect anywhere 
even close to that amount even with a 
doubling of the IRS’s budget, a massive 
expansion of a number of IRS employ-
ees, and a number of audits of everyday 
Americans. 
Even if Democrats do manage to rake 
in every dollar they are claiming, the 
tax hikes and revenue raisers they are 
proposing would have long-term costs 
beyond the dollar amount of the tax 
hikes. 
More than one of the Democrats’ tax 
proposals would have a chilling effect 
on investment and economic growth, 
which would mean a less vibrant econ-
omy with fewer jobs and opportunities 
for American workers, and the IRS pro-
posal I mentioned could put the details 
of Americans’ ordinary bank activities 
into the hands of the IRS, an agency 
that we have seen repeatedly mis-
handle the taxpayer data it already 
has, as recently as earlier this year. 
Democrats may be able to come up 
with a smaller top-line number by hid-
ing the true costs of the government 
programs they are contemplating, but 
their ‘‘buy now and pay later or pay 
never’’ approach to government spend-
ing is going to have serious con-
sequences for our economy and for the 
American people. 
Unfortunately, by the time the full 
costs of Democrats’ massive govern-
ment expansion are felt, it may be too 
late to do much about it; and that, ap-
parently, is what Democrats are count-
ing on. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

OPIOID CRISIS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, we 
need to talk about the opioid crisis. 
The 2020 data shows the largest an-
nual increase in opioid deaths in the 
last 50 years. According to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, 
69,710 Americans died last year from 
opioid-related overdoses, a 37-percent 
increase from 2019. 
In Louisiana, the opioid crisis is get-
ting worse—and fast. In 2020, our State, 
Louisiana, saw a serious spike and the 
steepest surge in drug overdose deaths 
in the Nation. Louisiana drug overdose 
deaths surpassed a record high 2,100 in 
the 12 months leading up to March 2021. 
Overdose mortality increased state-
wide by over 56 percent last year. 
These numbers are devastating. Last 
year, opioid deaths increased, for ex-
ample, in New Orleans by 51 percent 
with 365 OD deaths, 69 percent in Jef-
ferson Parish, 35 percent in St. Tam-
many, and a 64-percent increase in St. 
Bernard Parish. Deaths continue to 
climb throughout the State. 
In Alexandria, Acadian Ambulance 
‘‘responded to nearly 160 calls of opioid 
overdoses just in Rapides Parish—an 
average of over one call per day.’’ 
East Baton Rouge Parish, the State 
capital, is seeing significant increases 
in fatal overdoses. According to a local 
TV station and the coroner’s office, 242 
people died of an overdose in 2020. This 
year, through September, the East 
Baton Rouge Parish has seen 214 fatal 
overdoses, again, in the first 9 months 
of this year. 
Now, the double tragedy of this is 
that these deaths are preventable. In 
2018, Congress passed landmark opioid 
legislation, and for the first time in al-
most 30 years, the number of opioid 
deaths decreased. Then the pandemic 
hit. Louisiana became the top State in 
drug overdose growth during COVID–19. 
The pressure of the pandemic, the sub-
sequent influx of fentanyl from other 
countries—all this increased drug ad-
diction and, hence, drug death. After a 
year of lockdown, social isolation, and 
stress, the opioid-related deaths shot 
through the roof. 
Now, the opioid crisis is an epidemic. 
We should treat it like one. It took a 
backseat to COVID during the pan-
demic, but it is time we bring renewed 
attention to the opioid crisis because, 
for opioids, there is no vaccine. 
Over 1,900 folks in Louisiana lost 
their lives to drug overdose last year— 
again, a 48-percent increase from 2019. 
We must be aware that these are not 
just statistics; they are lives. They are 
mothers and fathers, daughters and 
sons, and friends losing their lives to 
addiction and being lost to others be-
cause of addiction. 
It is a national crisis, a statistical 
crisis, and, most importantly, a per-
sonal crisis. And as the numbers speak 
for themselves, we feel it throughout 
Louisiana and our Nation. 
We need to act now before more lives 
are lost. The crisis must be met head- 
on at all levels. We need to work with 
local leaders to make sure we imple-
ment opioid policies like the ones Con-
gress has already passed in CARA and 
the SUPPORT Act. These provide re-
sources to stop illegal drugs at the bor-
der, support the discovery of non-
addictive painkillers, and deliver treat-
ment to those already addicted. Every 
day we don’t take action, another 
mother loses a child, a son loses a fa-
ther, and a wife loses a husband. 
I am committed to solving this crisis 
and to saving these lives. Let’s come 
together as a Congress and rededicate 
ourselves to solving the opioid epi-
demic. 
With that, I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7356 
October 26, 2021 
5:30 p.m., the Senate will vote today on 
the confirmation of the Cobb, Wil-
liams, and Giles nominations, in that 
order. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I also 
want to extend my congratulations to 
four individuals, four friends, both 
former colleagues and folks I have 
known for a long time, who have just 
been confirmed by the Senate of the 
United States. Their confirmations will 
be conveyed to the President, and they 
will begin their service. 
I wanted to briefly thank the Mem-
bers of this Senate for acting quickly 
and appropriately to confirm the nomi-
nations of Senator Flake to represent 
us in Turkey, of Senator Udall to rep-
resent us in New Zealand, of Vicky 
Kennedy to represent us as Ambas-
sador to Austria, and of Mrs. Cindy 
McCain to represent us at the U.N. 
agencies in Rome. All four of these in-
credibly talented individuals are de-
serving of confirmation, and I am en-
couraged by this progress. 
I remain gravely concerned, however, 
at just how many nominees await ac-
tion here. There are dozens of countries 
where there is no confirmed American 
Ambassador, and I hope that this mo-
ment of progress will be a predictor of 
other progress to come soon in terms of 
other confirmations. 
(The remarks of Mr. COONS
per-
taining to the introduction of S. 3075 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. COONS. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2841 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I will be de-
livering remarks in a moment regard-
ing the unanimous consent request 
that I am about to make. In deference 
and as a courtesy to my colleague from 
Washington, I will make the request 
first rather than speaking first. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent, as if in legislative session, that 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor and Pensions be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 2841 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. Further, I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I do have 
good news for my colleague and every-
one looking for information about the 
safety of vaccines: The CDC already 
collects and publicly releases data like 
what this bill proposes. So anyone who 
is curious about whether they should 
get a COVID–19 vaccination can go to 
the CDC website right now at cdc.gov. 
And some more good news: The data 
overwhelmingly shows these vaccines 
meet FDA’s rigorous standards of safe-
ty and effectiveness. 
So now that that has been cleared up, 
I hope instead of wasting any more 
time on bills like this—bills which 
threaten to undermine public con-
fidence in vaccines and trust in our 
public health experts by ignoring the 
thorough work they already do to pro-
vide clear, scientific data—we can in-
stead focus on what we can all do to fi-
nally end this pandemic, which has 
now killed over 730,000 people and 
counting, and rebuild our country 
stronger and fairer. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, in recent 
years, particularly those on the other 
side of the aisle have called for, de-
clared, and demanded that we rebuild 
what they call trust in government. 
While I believe that Americans must 
have a healthy distrust of the idea of 
government and any expansion of the 
necessarily limited powers of the Fed-
eral Government, that does not exempt 
government from the obligation of 
being trustworthy. That is why I find 
the position that so many of my col-
leagues across the aisle are taking to 
be so confusing: trust, but verify; trust 
your neighbor, count the cards. 
People need information with which 
to analyze the faithfulness of govern-
ment and to accept the facts as they 
deem appropriate. Now they claim that 
Americans must be forced, coerced, 
prodded, cajoled, threatened into mak-
ing the government-approved medical 
decision. But heaven forbid if someone 
resists, objects due to moral or reli-
gious beliefs, or opts out of being vac-
cinated due to specific unique health 
concerns, she is derided and ignored, 
and—if the current Presidential admin-
istration has its way—forced out of her 
job. 
All of this is supposed to build a safer 
and more trusting society? 
This argument is totalitarian, and it 
is wrong. The United States is an open 
society, and the only way by which 
government can build trust with the 
American people is to earn it. The gov-
ernment will earn that trust only 
through transparency. 
I have come to the Senate floor now 
nine times to oppose President Biden’s 
immoral, unwise, and damaging vac-
cine mandate. I am committed to keep 
this going for as long as it takes to 
beat the mandate. I have introduced, 
now, a dozen bills to counteract, re-
strict, or limit the mandate. I do all 
this because I have heard from over 300 
Utahans from one end of the State to 
the other, who are at risk of losing 
their livelihoods due to this aggressive 
government overreach. 
Overreach of the government is stag-
gering in here. It is an overreach the 
likes of which we haven’t seen in this 
country in a long time; the likes of 
which we arguably haven’t seen since 
April 8, 1952, when President Harry 
Truman seized every steel mill in 
America in order to support the Korean 
war effort. Fortunately, within a cou-
ple of months, the Supreme Court of 
the United States acted and invali-
dated that maneuver as unlawful, un-
constitutional, which, of course, it was. 
In this instance, that hasn’t hap-
pened because, with respect to the 
OSHA mandate, the employer man-
date—one saying all employers with 
more than 99 employees have to com-
ply, have to fire people who aren’t vac-
cinated—there is nothing there because 
the authority doesn’t exist. But, in the 
meantime, corporate America is pick-
ing up the slack and doing the Presi-
dent’s dirty work for him. 
But it is a government overreach, 
and it is an overreach that is harming 
good people, people who are not en-
emies of the United States. No, they 
are not enemies to anyone. They are 
our neighbors, our fellow citizens, and 
our friends. Their stories are as tragic 
as they are moving, yet this adminis-
tration seems bent on assuming that 
they have no voice, on giving them no 
voice. 
Don’t get me wrong, I am not against 
the mandate—I am against the man-
date. I am not against the vaccine, not 
in any way. I am fully vaccinated. My 
entire family has been vaccinated. I 
have encouraged people to get vac-
cinated for the specific reason that I 
see the vaccines as miracles and mir-
acles that are protecting many, many 
millions of Americans from the harms 
of COVID–19. 
But if government is trying to en-
courage Americans to get vaccinated, 
hiding information about their con-
cerns with the vaccine is the worst pos-
sible way to build trust. It has the 
exact opposite of what they claim they 
are trying to do. Existing concerns, 
make no mistake, are not just going to 
evaporate if they are ignored. 
And the government’s lack of trans-
parency should be just as concerning to 
Americans who aren’t worried about 
the vaccine as it is to those who are. 
Government should never be in the 
business of hiding information about 
the adverse effects and risks involved, 
no matter how infrequent or uncom-
mon they might be. 
And the government has—let’s face 
it—been less than forthright with in-
formation 
about 
vaccine 
complica-
tions. Adverse reactions to the vaccine 
have 
been 
documented 
since 
the 
COVID–19 shot became available. The 
administration’s message has been: Get 
the vaccine; it is safe, period. 
If individuals pose questions about 
possible risks, about its interactions

October 26, 2021 
with other medical treatments, or 
about rare reactions seen directly after 
its administration, they are often 
pushed aside, denied proper care, or 
deemed crazy conspiracy theorists for 
trying to scare the public away from 
the vaccine. 
Sadly, this breeds distrust and it 
threatens the ability of those who ex-
perience rare vaccine injuries, the abil-
ity to access the proper treatment, 
care, and respect they deserve. 
We should all be able to agree this 
type of governmental deception has no 
place in the United States. That is why 
today I came to the floor to offer the 
Transparency in COVID–19 Vaccination 
Act. 
This bill would require the Secretary 
of Health and Human Services to pub-
licly disclose all information regarding 
adverse effects of the COVID–19 vac-
cines. This sunshine would help clear 
the air and allow individuals and the 
medical community the opportunity to 
make informed decisions. 
This clarity would also be an impor-
tant step toward building trust with 
the American public. Americans have 
the best, most accurate information 
when they make medical decisions—at 
least they try to. They deserve to have 
the best and most accurate informa-
tion when they make medical deci-
sions. This bill would ensure that hap-
pens. That is why I came to the floor to 
offer it today, offer that we pass it and 
offer the protections. 
My friend and distinguished col-
league, the Senator from Washington, 
regrettably objected to it. In doing so, 
she argued that it is not necessary be-
cause, according to the Senator from 
Washington, all the information that 
they need is now available. In many in-
stances, it is not. This bill would re-
quire that be made available—all of it. 
The CDC does collect information on 
it, but the American people don’t have 
full access to that information, and 
they should. 
That begs the question: Why? Why 
would anyone want to do that? 
I don’t know why. To me, it doesn’t 
make sense, especially if one wants to 
increase the number of people getting 
the vaccine as I do. 
I would like to see more people get-
ting vaccinated because I think the 
vaccine is something of a medical mir-
acle and it is protecting many, many 
millions of Americans from the harm-
ful effects of COVID–19. That is a good 
thing. 
We want them to be protected. To be 
protected, we want them to get vac-
cinated. It doesn’t mean government 
should force it on them, and it cer-
tainly doesn’t mean that government 
should be perceived in any way as 
being less than forthcoming with infor-
mation that it gains access to. 
That is all this bill would require. It 
is not hard. There is nothing wrong 
with doing that. In fact, my colleague 
from Washington insists that it is al-
ready done. 
If that is the case, what is wrong 
with putting that into law? 
There isn’t anything. We should do 
it. 
I will be back on this and other top-
ics related to the COVID–19 vaccine 
mandates. 
All this is unfortunate. No one is 
happy about the fact that COVID–19 
has touched our country in the way 
that it has. It has been painful. It is 
devastating. The 730,000 Americans who 
have died with COVID are tragedies, 
each and every one of them. 
There is nothing about government 
overreach that will bring them back. 
There is certainly not anything about 
government overreach that is going to 
have a proper influence than the Amer-
ican people. There is certainly not any-
thing about government hiding the ball 
when it comes to data that the Amer-
ican people deserve and want to have 
access to that is going to make people 
better. 
We want more people to get vac-
cinated. Because of that, we want them 
to have the facts. We should do that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
ENERGY POLICIES 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after 
failing to pass any radical climate pro-
posals this year, it appears our col-
leagues across the aisle are in a panic 
mode. The reason is, later this week, 
President Biden will be traveling to 
Glasgow, along with a dozen or more 
U.S. officials and Members of Congress, 
for a U.N. climate summit, and it looks 
like they are going to show up empty- 
handed. 
The President has talked a big game 
when it comes to climate change. On 
the campaign trail, he promised that 
the electric sector would be carbon pol-
lution-free by 2035. He committed to 
building 1.5 million energy-efficient 
homes and public housing units, and he 
said the United States would transition 
from oil and gas. 
Of course, he will be long gone from 
office, so he will never be held account-
able for these projections, even if they 
miss by a mile, which I predict they 
will. But the fact is he has failed to 
make good on his promises to fun-
damentally transform the energy land-
scape in America, and I would suggest 
that that is for a very good reason. 
Policies that drive up costs for the 
American people, hurt our energy secu-
rity, and enrich our adversaries don’t 
typically get a lot of traction here in 
the U.S. Congress. 
Two-and-a-half years ago, we saw a 
great example of how unpopular these 
policies were when the pie-in-the-sky 
Green New Deal came to the Senate 
floor for a vote. Not a single Senator 
voted for that bill. Even the Members 
who introduced it were too afraid to 
vote yes because of the blowback. 
But now that our Democratic col-
leagues control all levers of the Fed-
eral Government, afraid of their rad-
ical base, their calculus seems to have 
changed, so they are trying to jam 
these radical policies into the multi-
trillion-dollar tax-and-spending spree 
bill, otherwise known as reconciliation. 
Despite working on this bill for 
months and only needing Democrat 
support to get it to the President’s 
desk, our Democratic colleagues are 
still struggling to reach an agreement 
among themselves. But now that Presi-
dent Biden has a deadline and he wants 
to look good in front of other world 
leaders in Glasgow, it is, apparently, 
crunch time. 
But they have a problem: no bill has 
even been written or even seen the 
light of day. There is a steady stream 
of reporting about which outrageous 
policies are in and which are out, but 
none of us have seen a bill—we haven’t 
seen it in writing—if it exists at all. 
Based on reporting, though, massive 
tax hikes on the energy sector appear 
to be in the mix. Energy companies 
would pay higher taxes on income 
earned in the global marketplace and 
be subjected to the double taxation of 
their foreign incomes. And we know 
that when producers have higher over-
head because of the higher tax burden, 
they don’t absorb that; they pass it 
along to consumers in terms of higher 
prices. 
Our Democratic colleagues want to 
also add a Superfund excise tax, which 
would force energy companies to pay 
more on every barrel of crude oil that 
is sold. Tax hikes on oil and gas compa-
nies won’t increase the output of re-
newables, and renewables only ac-
counted for 20 percent of the electricity 
generation last year while natural gas 
accounted for double that. 
That is why, in my State, we believe 
in the all-of-the-above approach—all 
forms of energy—knowing that the Sun 
doesn’t always shine and the wind 
doesn’t always blow. We found out last 
year, because of extremely cold weath-
er, we couldn’t even put natural gas in 
the pipeline because we didn’t have the 
electricity to run the compressors, and 
so it was—no pun intended—a perfect 
storm. 
What we learned from that experi-
ence—and I think what we should all 
learn—is that renewables have their 
place. They are important, and their 
role is growing, but you have to have a 
reliable base load of energy, which re-
newables cannot supply. The only out-
come of these tax hikes will be to drive 
up costs for working families and send 
more business to foreign energy pro-
ducers. 
I remember recently that President 
Biden, in looking at the high price of 
gasoline—which has gone up dramati-
cally—looked to OPEC—the Organiza-
tion of the Petroleum Exporting Coun-
tries—led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, 
and asked them to produce more oil. 
Well, how about American energy 
producers and the jobs that go along 
with that and the pipelines that move 
that oil and gas safely around the 
country? 
He is OK with Nord Stream 2, which 
is a Russian gas pipeline over in Eu-
rope; but when it comes to the Key-
stone XL Pipeline here in America, 
‘‘shut her down’’ is his attitude.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7358 
October 26, 2021 
Massive tax increases aren’t the only 
provisions that seem to have survived 
negotiations, the best we can tell from 
the reporting. Handouts to wealthy 
Americans to buy electric vehicles ap-
pears to be safe. Talk about socialism 
for rich people. These aren’t cars that 
average working families can afford to 
buy. They are, roughly, double or more 
expensive than regular cars operating 
on an internal combustion engine. Nev-
ertheless, this bill, apparently, will 
provide for $12,500 in tax credits for 
electric vehicle purchases—again, for 
some of the most expensive cars in the 
marketplace. 
So, for those people working for a liv-
ing, who cannot afford to buy these ex-
pensive electric vehicles even with this 
very generous tax credit, they are 
going to be asked to subsidize the pur-
chase of these vehicles by wealthy 
Americans who don’t need the tax cred-
it or the subsidy coming from hard- 
working American families. 
This subsidy isn’t only set up to re-
ward 
buyers 
purchasing 
American- 
made vehicles; you can still receive a 
taxpayer handout even if the vehicle is 
completely or substantially made over-
seas, in countries like China. 
On top of that, a bigger tax credit is 
available to electric cars built in union 
shops. Well, maybe union-built vehicles 
are somehow more green than other 
electric vehicles. I doubt that. Or 
maybe it is a favor doled out to a fa-
vored interest group by our friends 
across the aisle. That seems like the 
more likely conclusion. 
While electric vehicles don’t use gas-
oline, they still require a lot of energy 
to run. Our colleagues don’t, appar-
ently, know where electricity needed 
to run these vehicles comes from. Well, 
I will tell them. It comes from coal; it 
comes from natural gas; it comes from 
renewables; it comes from hydropower 
and nuclear power or some mixture of 
all of those. Yet these are the very en-
ergy sources they say they are seeking 
to avoid by incentivizing more use of 
electric vehicles. 
Well, if Democrats raise taxes on 
companies that produce natural gas, 
which accounts for 40 percent of our 
electricity production, what is the plan 
to power the fleet of taxpayer-sub-
sidized electric vehicles? 
Renewables don’t generate enough 
energy to power our country today, let 
alone the amount we need to charge 
millions of new electric vehicles. Still, 
the Democrats are eager to push Amer-
ica toward renewables and punish those 
who don’t jump on board. 
One of the most controversial parts 
of the Democrats’ energy push appears 
to be in peril, if you can believe the re-
porting. Again, none of us have seen 
this. We just know what we read. That 
program is known as the Clean Elec-
tricity Performance Program, or the 
CEPP. This program would reward util-
ity companies that already use renew-
able electricity sources and punish 
those that do not. 
So, if you are wondering how that 
switch would go, just look at some of 
the energy policies out West, in Cali-
fornia. That State made an aggressive 
push to transition to push 100-percent 
renewables by 2030, but as I said, re-
newable energy is not always reliable 
energy, and it certainly isn’t affordable 
energy. In recent years, California has 
implemented rolling blackouts to ra-
tion limited energy supplies during the 
hot summer months; and, on average, 
Californians pay twice as much as Tex-
ans for electricity. That is where those 
higher prices go—they get passed on to 
the consumer. Twice as much is the 
cost of electricity in California as com-
pared to Texas. 
So imagine what would happen if 
every utility company across the coun-
try were forced to use only renewable 
sources. 
Last month, the Federal Energy Reg-
ulatory 
Commission’s 
Commissioner 
testified before the Senate, and he said 
this proposal would be an ‘‘H bomb’’ for 
electricity markets. It would blow it 
up. 
Our 
colleague, 
Senator 
MANCHIN, 
from West Virginia, has said he won’t 
support this proposal; and good for 
him, but other Democrats have not 
given up yet. 
President Biden recently insisted 
‘‘nothing has been formally agreed to.’’ 
Again, this whole process is opaque 
to Republicans because we haven’t 
been invited to the table or welcomed 
to the table to try to come up with a 
bipartisan policy. Our Democratic col-
leagues have insisted they want to do 
this all on their own because they 
know only then will they be able to 
come up, presumably, with something 
that will appease the most radical ele-
ments of their political base, and if 
they negotiated with the Republicans, 
they wouldn’t be able to do that be-
cause we would have to negotiate to-
ward the center rather than on the 
fringes of political ideology. 
Despite the fact that these policies 
that I have mentioned would radically 
transform the energy landscape and 
drive up costs to consumers and hurt 
our energy security, our colleagues are 
rushing—rushing—to reach a deal be-
fore the President is wheels up to Eu-
rope. Forget sound public policy; Presi-
dent Biden wants a new talking point 
at the United Nations climate summit 
in Glasgow, Scotland. 
This rush job comes at a time when 
energy 
prices 
are 
already 
sky-
rocketing. Talk about inflation. Gaso-
line is up more than 55 percent from a 
year ago. With winter fast approach-
ing, heating bills, including heating oil 
that many Northern States use, are ex-
pected to rise as much as 54 percent 
from last year. This is really an invis-
ible tax on people, where the value of 
your dollar that you earn is diminished 
by the increase in cost—54 percent over 
last year for heating bills in the north-
ern part of our country. Well, it is all 
across the country, but it is, obviously, 
needed more there than in my part of 
the country. 
Of course, these aren’t the only high-
er prices that families are facing. Infla-
tion continues to pummel the Amer-
ican people, putting a tight squeeze on 
family budgets. For seniors, for vet-
erans, and others who operate on fixed 
incomes, those price hikes are a threat 
to their livelihoods. There could not be 
a more dangerous or costly time to 
wage war on American energy. No fam-
ily should have to choose between buy-
ing groceries and turning on the heat 
in the wintertime. 
President Biden is eager to put a 
show on in Glasgow and impress world 
leaders 
with 
dubious 
commitments 
that he can’t keep, but these measures 
have the potential to inflict real and 
lasting harm on the American people. 
I am not opposed to renewable en-
ergy, electric vehicles, or efforts to 
preserve our greatest natural resources 
for future generations. I support efforts 
to capture carbon and sequester it. All 
of these policies need to strike a deli-
cate balance based on prudence, based 
on science, and based on logic, not 
based on some ideology about the way 
that you wish the world was; it is how 
the world is. 
Democrats want to force the Amer-
ican people to pay more for less reli-
able energy and endanger our own en-
ergy security to meet these arbitrary 
net zero deadlines. As I said, they are 
rushing to meet a deadline so that 
President Biden can have a good ap-
plause line in Glasgow. 
This is just the latest example of how 
the reckless tax-and-spending spree is 
not helping the American people at all 
but, rather, it is about forcing Demo-
crats’ vision on every city, State, and 
family in the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Connecticut. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, C.J. 
Brown was 7 years old. He was a second 
grader at Clarksdale Collegiate acad-
emy in Mississippi. Clarksdale, MS, is 
a relatively small town of 15,000 people. 
Everybody knows each other in Clarks-
dale. C.J. was described as a really 
bright young student. His principal and 
director at his school said that he was 
a great student. He was always cheer-
ful and friendly to his classmates and 
teachers. 
Clarksdale is reeling right now be-
cause just a few weeks ago, on October 
12, little C.J. Brown was sitting in a 
car outside of a laundromat, and he 
was shot to death. The owner of a near-
by corner store, the Tiger Mart, said 
that C.J. and his mom and his little 
sister used to come in all the time, 
friendly as can be, chatting up a storm. 
The owner of that little convenience 
store said that he considered C.J. and 
his mom and his little sister to be fam-
ily. 
You can say that C.J. was in the 
wrong place at the wrong time—a 7- 
year-old kid in a car outside of a laun-
dromat shot to death—but he wasn’t. 
He was in the right place at the right 
time. He was in what should have been 
a safe place his hometown, just sitting 
in a car.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7359 
October 26, 2021 
That day, there were three shootings 
over 5 hours in this small town of 
Clarksdale. C.J. wasn’t the only vic-
tim, but his death made news because 
he was 7 years old, and now he is gone. 
The problem is, this story isn’t the 
exception; it is the rule, increasingly 
so, across this country. For the last 8 
years, I have come down to the floor 
with a chart that looks very much like 
this. In fact, I think this is the chart 
that I have displayed for about 5 years 
straight. I come down here every few 
weeks—sometimes, in busier times, 
every month or so—and I tell the story 
of men and women and children, often 
like C.J., to try to rattle the con-
science of this body to do something 
about the epidemic of gun violence in 
this country. 
These numbers in and of themselves 
are stunning. This is my old chart 
showing 36,000 people a year are killed 
by gunshot wounds—3,000 a month, 100 
people day. There is no other nation in 
the high-income world that has any-
thing approaching these numbers when 
it comes to gun violence. But these 
numbers are irrelevant now because 
what has happened over the last year 
and a half is a story unto itself. 
Gun violence rates have spiked dur-
ing the pandemic. In fact, the increase 
in 2020 was the biggest in 60 years from 
year to year. So I now have to bring a 
new chart to the floor. This one that I 
have used for 5 years now is irrelevant 
because no longer are 36,000 people 
dying a year from gunshot wounds. No 
longer are we losing 3,000 a month or 
100 a day. We are now losing 40,000 a 
year, 3,300 a month, 110 people a day. 
You can say: Well, that is a small in-
crease. A hundred people used to die 
from gunshot wounds a day; now only 
110 people a day. 
That is 10 more families every single 
day, like the family of C.J. Brown, who 
have lost a loved one, often in the 
prime of their life, to a preventable 
crime that happens nowhere else at 
this frequency amongst our high-in-
come peers. 
What 
is 
interesting 
about 
2020, 
though, is that overall crime rates 
didn’t spike like gun homicides did. In 
fact, over all, major crimes in 2020 in 
this country went down, but gun homi-
cides went up. There were 5,000 more 
gun homicides in 2020 than in 2019. 
What is going on if major crimes are 
going down but gun homicides are 
going up? The story is likely com-
plicated, but at the heart of it is this: 
More guns equals more crime. Forget 
the mythology that tells you that if 
you buy a gun, you are going to use 
that gun to protect yourself, that you 
are going to use it against an intruder 
or somebody who is trying to do harm 
to you. No. The data is the data. You 
can’t get around it. It shows that for 
every community that has a 1-percent 
increase in gun ownership, what comes 
with it is a 1-percent increase in gun 
homicides. The more guns you have, 
the more likely that you are to have 
days like October 12, 2021, in Clarks-
dale, MS. 
But there is more data to prove this 
point. What is interesting is that over 
the last 10 years, more and more homi-
cides in this country are gun homi-
cides. Ten years ago, about two-thirds 
of all homicides in this country in-
volved a gun. But we have had more 
and more and more guns being pur-
chased over the last 10 years. It used to 
be that maybe only 32 percent of house-
holds had a gun. Today, that number is 
39 percent. So we have a lot more 
households with guns. 
We had record numbers of guns 
bought in 2020. In March of 2020, for the 
first time, the background check sys-
tem registered 1 million checks. Never 
before has this country had more guns 
bought and sold than in 2020. Not coin-
cidentally, today, the number of homi-
cides that involve a gun isn’t two- 
thirds any longer; it is three-quarters. 
It went from 67 percent in a decade to 
77 percent. More guns equals more 
homicides. More guns equals a greater 
number of violent crimes being perpet-
uated with guns. The data is the data. 
You can’t get around it. 
You think you are making yourself 
safer by bringing a gun into your 
house, but more often than not, that 
gun is going to be used to harm you or 
a loved one than it is against someone 
who is trying to do harm to you. 
Many of these guns end up very 
quickly becoming illegal guns because 
they may at first be sold through a li-
censed gun dealer, but pretty soon, 
they get into the black market. Pretty 
soon, those guns get into the black 
internet market, the gun show market, 
where anybody can buy a gun regard-
less of their criminal record in many 
States without being caught, and those 
guns get trafficked to all sorts of peo-
ple who should never own them. 
The data is the data. 
But here is what we also know about 
2020: In States that have tougher gun 
laws, the rise in violent crime in 2020 
was much lower than in States that 
don’t 
have 
universal 
background 
checks. Now, we make the case here 
that gun laws matter, that if you take 
some commonsense steps to keep guns 
out of the hands of the wrong people— 
violent criminals, people with serious 
mental illness—you are going to have 
less gun crime. Well, that is what 2020 
tells us. In States that have universal 
background checks, the violent crime 
rate just ticked up from 2019 to 2020— 
just ticked up—but in States without 
expanded background checks, the vio-
lent crime rate skyrocketed. There was 
a much bigger increase in States with-
out universal background checks than 
in States with universal background 
checks. Common sense tells you why. 
Those States just do a little bit better 
job of making sure that only respon-
sible gun owners can get their hands on 
a gun. 
So we have these two stories from 
2020 to tell. The first is a tragic one— 
a dramatic increase in the number of 
homicides; new highs in terms of the 
number of people who die at the hands 
of a gun every single day. But this sec-
ond story about how States that have 
gotten 
serious 
about 
commonsense 
measures supported by 90 percent of 
Americans to make sure that only law- 
abiding citizens have guns—they were 
able to control these increases much 
better than the States that didn’t im-
plement universal background checks 
and commonsense gun laws. 
So I tell the story of C.J. today to try 
to shake this body into action and to 
try to make folks understand that we 
have all the data we need to have to 
tell us what works. None of it is that 
controversial. No matter what State 
you come from—blue or red, Repub-
lican, Democratic—your constituents 
support universal background checks. 
The data tells us that while 2020 was an 
awful year for gun crime, it was a lot 
more awful in the States that didn’t in-
vest in that policy. So why not just im-
plement it on a national basis? It is po-
litically popular and impactful when it 
comes to saving lives. 
Lastly, even if you don’t agree with 
me that we should make these com-
monsense changes to try to do some-
thing about this rising epidemic of gun 
violence in this country; even if you 
don’t want to change the gun laws in 
this Nation, I have another offer for 
you. 
I heard Senator CORNYN come down 
to the floor and talk about all the rad-
ical policies that are in the Build Back 
Better agenda. I have seen the polling 
on the Build Back Better agenda. None 
of it looks too radical because the 
American people seem to really love all 
the parts of the Build Back Better 
agenda, from the investments in green 
energy, to the help for families who are 
trying to afford childcare, to the im-
provements in the Medicare system. 
But here is another commonsense in-
vestment in the Build Back Better 
agenda: community gun violence ini-
tiatives. Inside the Build Back Better 
agenda is $5 billion to invest in com-
munity programs that wrap services 
around at-risk youth to try to stop this 
cycle of violence that plays out. 
Now, what is interesting in the 2020 
data is that gun crime is becoming 
much more geographically spread out 
in this Nation. Ten, twenty, thirty 
years ago, there was a case to be made 
for the concentration of gun violence 
in a handful of cities. That is actually 
not the case any longer. Today, gun vi-
olence happens everywhere. It happens 
in small towns. It happens in small cit-
ies. It happens in the big cities. But it 
is still true that there are these very, 
very poor, very, very economically 
challenged 
neighborhoods 
in 
which 
there are higher rates of gun violence. 
What we know is that these commu-
nity violence programs work. In Con-
necticut, we had one—before it was 
defunded—in New Haven, Hartford, and 
Bridgeport. It identified youth at risk 
of falling into this cycle of violence. It 
supports them with programs that give 
them an alternative to that lifestyle.

homicides in these three cities were 
cut in half. 
A similar program in New York saw 
homicides in a South Bronx neighbor-
hood where a program was being imple-
mented decline by 37 percent compared 
to a very similarly matched neighbor-
hood nearby that was used as a control 
site. 
I can give you more and more evi-
dence of how these investments in 
neighborhoods lift people up economi-
cally and help stop the cycle of vio-
lence. 
So I can shower you with data to 
show you why commonsense changes in 
our gun laws would do something about 
this stunning increase in the rate of 
gun deaths in this country from 2019 to 
2020, but we can also just come to-
gether around an investment in these 
communities and these kids and these 
families that doesn’t necessarily have 
the same high degree of political tem-
perature as the debate around guns 
does, and it still will have a significant 
impact. 
So I will continue to come down to 
the floor and make this case. I will 
continue to come down to the floor and 
try to tell the story of these victims of 
gun violence—kids like CJ Brown. 
I hope that this will be the last 
chart. I hope that the next chart, in 
fact, will show that these numbers are 
coming down. But I doubt that I will 
have that opportunity because until we 
get serious about making changes in 
our gun laws, to update them to match 
with the preferences of 90 percent of 
Americans, and until we get serious 
about investments in these neighbor-
hoods—part of the Build Back Better 
agenda—I fear that these numbers will 
continue to rise higher and higher. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I speak 
today to recognize the 3 million men 
and 
women, 
Americans, who have 
served our Nation in the two decades 
since September 11, 2001, in what has 
become known as the Global War on 
Terrorism. 
The days during—in just the last 
month—during this botched and cha-
otic 
withdrawal 
from 
Afghanistan, 
were a terrible time of reckoning for 
our Nation. I am angry, discouraged, 
and concerned about the way and the 
manner by which the United States of 
America departed. 
President Biden’s announcement in 
April to completely withdraw Amer-
ican troops by September 11 without 
taking 
appropriate 
security 
pre-
cautions, including preparation for a 
return of the Taliban to Kabul, was ir-
responsible and will damage America’s 
interest for years to come and endan-
ger the lives of thousands of women 
and children in Afghanistan. 
Additionally, the lack of urgency to 
do right by the thousands of Afghans 
who worked alongside Americans will 
forever be a source of shame for this 
administration. But as I said many 
times before, the withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan was not the fault of the men 
and women in uniform. 
In the days following September 11, 
2001, the call to service was answered 
by 
thousands—thousands—of 
Ameri-
cans who sought to defend the United 
States. These men and women left be-
hind their families and careers to serve 
a greater good. I cannot think of any-
thing more honorable than stepping up 
to defend our homeland from a threat 
that was, at the time, relatively un-
known. 
For most of our men and women in 
uniform, the Global War on Terrorism 
has been the primary mission of their 
entire careers. I run into people regu-
larly who tell me about their service, 
and they saw what happened on 9/11 in 
New York City at Ground Zero. They 
saw what happened in the fields of 
Pennsylvania and what happened at 
the Pentagon. They decided it was 
their moment to step forward and de-
fend and protect their Nation, to make 
sure that freedom and liberty remained 
the hallmark of who we are. And all of 
the sacrifices they and their families 
have made were in support of that ef-
fort and it was an effort they believed 
in and I certainly hope they still do. 
Those who stepped forward to serve, 
eradicated vast networks of terrorists 
who wished to do America harm, mak-
ing it absolutely clear that no one can 
harm Americans without our swift and 
certain retribution. They also brought 
Osama bin Laden to justice, destroyed 
the ISIS caliphate, and eliminated its 
founder. 
In Afghanistan, our men and women 
serving in the military brought hope to 
a brutalized, war-torn country for the 
first time in decades. Incredibly, an en-
tire generation in Afghanistan came to 
age knowing what it feels like to see 
freedom and to feel freedom. 
Tragically, 
we 
saw 
Afghanistan 
quickly fall to the Taliban. It happened 
because of a haphazard and unorga-
nized withdrawal process that has 
made our country and our world a less 
secure place. We all saw the images of 
terror and desperation as Afghans tried 
to flee their fate, many at the cost of 
their lives. We saw the footage of the 
chaos, the tear gas, and the explosion. 
We lost 13 lives of our honorable brave 
men and women in uniform to an at-
tack outside the airport gates as they 
tried to rescue innocent families from 
their Afghan brothers and sisters in 
arms. 
These scenes captured our Nation’s 
attention, rightfully so. But unfortu-
nately, in the days that followed, 
mainstream media’s interest in Af-
ghanistan began to wane. Take a look 
to see what is happening in Afghani-
stan now. See the desolation, the 
death, the destruction, the hunger, and 
the fear. This failure to have attention 
on what is going on in Afghanistan 
must not and should not be the case. 
We must continue to honor those who 
served and who will serve our country 
in the future. 
We should consider S. 535, the Global 
War on Terrorism Memorial Location 
Act. This bill was introduced by the 
Senator 
from 
Iowa, 
Senator 
JONI 
ERNST, herself a veteran. It will au-
thorize the location of a memorial on 
the National Mall to truly honor those 
who served to eradicate terrorism. It 
will honor the 3 million men and 
women who served and especially the 
thousands of servicemembers who gave 
that ultimate sacrifice—their lives. 
This memorial will also honor, heal, 
empower, and unite soldiers, sailors, 
airmen, marines, and coasties who 
made those sacrifices. 
I would guess many of us in the U.S. 
Senate have seen—we witnessed some 
of the healing that personally occurs in 
times that have met with the Honor— 
as I have met with the folks who have 
been here on the Honor Flights, those 
visitors who gather at our war memo-
rials to remember, to be together, and, 
yes, to heal. 
Last week, I was at a number of our 
memorials here in our Nation’s Capital 
with a group of over about 160 Vietnam 
veterans from Kansas. I have been vis-
iting with those veterans in almost all 
of the visits of Kansans who come here, 
and in those visits, I met the World 
War II veterans, the Korean war vet-
erans, and the Vietnam war veterans 
who have a place of honor on the Mall 
where they can go to meet other vet-
erans, to lay flowers, to pause and re-
flect, and remember the brothers and 
sisters that they have lost. 
Just this weekend, back in Valley 
Center, KS, the Moving Wall—a tribute 
to those who lost their lives in Viet-
nam; the thousands, the 627 Kansans 
who lost their lives in Vietnam—was a 
place in which people gathered to do 
exactly that. 
I hope someday I will be able to at-
tend an Honor Flight to the Global War 
on Terrorism Memorial and meet with 
the generation of veterans who fought 
to bring peace to the Middle East and 
who fought to bring the United States 
into a safer and more secure place. It 
will be my honor and privilege to do so. 
I am here on the Senate floor to pay 
tribute, to honor and respect, and to 
tell those who served in the Global War 
on Terrorism that we respect them; we 
thank them for their service; and we 
love them. 
I yield the floor.

on Terror. His leadership is commend-

So I thank the distinguished Senator

admiration and respect I follow his

happened in Afghanistan because just

McCollum, who was one of those 13 who 
was killed in Kabul at the airport on 
that fateful day in Afghanistan, merely 
2 months ago. And with us also was 
Rylee’s wife GiGi and the baby that 
was born after Rylee had been killed— 
the baby who will never know her fa-
ther, who will always know his story, 
and will always know that he was an 
American hero. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
Mr. President, I come to the floor 
today to oppose what the Democrats 
are trying to do with their reckless 
tax-and-spending 
spree. 
Right 
now, 
prices are rising all across America. 
The price of gas has gone up by nearly 
$1 since the day Joe Biden took the 
oath of office. One in five families has 
had to cut down on their spending, 
their other spending to pay for energy 
this year, and it is going to get worse 
this winter. 
In total, the typical American family 
is paying about $175 more every month, 
month after month, because of infla-
tion. And the front page story of the 
New York Times today talked about 
the upcoming Thanksgiving as the 
most expensive Thanksgiving dinner of 
all, and they called it a wallop to the 
wallet. That is the front page of the 
New York Times. 
I would say, when you see that kind 
of a story, you know that inflation is 
here, and it looks like it is here to 
stay. And it is connected directly to 
the policies of this President, this ad-
ministration, and the Democrats in 
Congress who are trying to make it 
worse with this tax-and-spending spree. 
Democrats ought to be working with 
Republicans to reduce inflation and to 
cut the spending, but that is not what 
is happening. No, we see just the oppo-
site. 
The Democrats are completely fo-
cused on the most expensive spending 
bill in American history. Right now, 
the cost is at least $3.5 trillion. With 
interest payments, the pricetag rises to 
$4.2 trillion. The bill is 2,500 pages in 
length. You do the math. That is 
$1,400,000,000 for each and every page. 
You divide the cost of the bill by the 
number of people in America, it is over 
$10,000 for every man, woman, and 
child. 
The amount that is being proposed to 
spend is larger than the entire econ-
omy of Japan, which is the third larg-
est economy in the world. And the bill 
is a towering list of radical liberal pri-
orities: permanent welfare programs, 
free money for electric vehicle owners, 
earmarks for New York City and San 
Francisco, including NANCY
PELOSI’s 
special park for the privileged. 
Now Democrats are playing a shell 
game, trying to hide from the Amer-
ican people how they are going to pay 
for this whole thing. Well, they con-
tinue to try to hide the ball. Is it more 
taxes? Is it more debt? Is it some of 
both? Let’s be clear: No matter which 
one they decide to do, prices for the 
American consumer is going to con-
tinue to go up. No matter which one 
they choose, the American people are 
going to end up paying one way or the 
other. 
So, last week, the President went to 
Pennsylvania and said he didn’t want 
to talk about the cost of the bill. He 
said: We shouldn’t talk about the num-
bers. We shouldn’t even talk about the 
numbers. 
Now, I can understand why President 
Biden doesn’t want to talk about the 
numbers because the American people 
are getting sticker shock. But people 
all around this country, at the kitchen 
table, when they sit down and try to 
figure out how much money they have 
and what kind of bills are coming in 
and see the price of food going up and 
the price of fuel going up and the price 
of gasoline going up and the price of 
one thing after another and housing 
going up—people at the kitchen table 
are talking about the numbers. 
President Biden would rather tell all 
of us that the bill costs zero dollars. 
His Press Secretary, his Chief of Staff, 
and NANCY PELOSI have all repeated 
the same big lie. They say the largest 
spending bill in history costs zero dol-
lars. This isn’t just false; it is absurd. 
If it costs zero dollars, why are they 
having such a hard time trying to get 
it passed? Answer that. 
The American people aren’t falling 
for this. The American people know. 
They know that when Democrats spend 
more, they pay more, one way or the 
other. 
So why do Democrats keep repeating 
the big lie? Because they know that 
people don’t want a big spending bill. 
They are against it. 
Tax revenues are already at record 
highs in this country. Our problem 
isn’t that we are taxed too little; it is 
that we spend too much. Yet Demo-
crats’ spending bill contains more than 
40 new tax increases. If these taxes be-
come law, everyone will have to pay 
one way or the other. They will pay 
more in taxes. They will suffer with 
lower wages, in terms of spending ca-
pacity, and pay higher prices. 
According to the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, 
two-thirds 
of 
the 
taxes 
Democrats are proposing for businesses 
would be paid by the middle class. Now, 
that is not what the President wants 
you to believe—paid by the middle 
class, no question about it. 
Democrats know the American peo-
ple don’t want higher taxes. A Gallup 
poll showed recently fewer than one in 
five Americans wants more govern-
ment if it is paid for by tax increases. 
The American people don’t want more 
spending, which they know we can’t, as 
a nation, afford with the kind of debt 
we have. 
That is why Democrats, each and 
every one, seem to be trying to hide 
the cost of the bill through accounting 
gimmicks. The gimmicks are so bla-
tant even their own Democrat experts 
are telling them to stop it. 
President 
Obama’s 
‘‘auto 
czar,’’ 
Steve Rattner, a major critic of these 
accounting tactics and tricks, he actu-
ally wrote an editorial in the New York 
Times about it. He said: 
[W]ith worrisome inflation signs evident, 
we certainly don’t need any more stimulus. 
Democrats are trying to find new 
ways to take more money from the 
American people. They are proposing 
to supersize the IRS, and the IRS is al-
ready the least accountable and most 
powerful Agency in the entire govern-
ment. 
Right now, the annual IRS budget is 
about $13 billion. Democrats want an-
other $80 billion to hire an army of IRS 
agents to rifle through the bank 
records of the American people. Even 
President Obama’s IRS Commissioner 
is against a budget that big. 
This proposal just shows how des-
perate Democrats are to get every last 
penny they can so they can spend it. 
For weeks, Democrats said they want-
ed to force banks to tell the IRS about 
any account with $600 in deposits or 
withdrawals. Well, the American peo-
ple found out, and they were outraged. 
I received more calls and more letters 
on this single topic than on any other 
topic during the entire years I have 
been in the U.S. Senate. But yet Demo-
crats defended the plan for weeks, in-
cluding Janet Yellen, the Treasury 
Secretary, on national television. 
It has been fascinating to watch her 
argue back and forth with Larry Sum-
mers, a former economic adviser to 
both Bill Clinton, who was Secretary of 
the Treasury for him, as well as to 
Barack Obama. 
Well, now Democrats finally realize 
how angry the American people are at 
this Big Brother proposal. 
So what is their solution? More gim-
micks, more sleight at hand. Now 
Janet Yellen says the policy will only 
apply to accounts with total trans-
actions of more than $10,000 over the 
course of a year. 
Well, that new proposal and that 
gimmick would still affect 
nearly 
every American in this country who 
has a bank account. It is essentially 
the same proposal. The American peo-
ple aren’t buying it. 
So the Democrats are now on the 
horns of a dilemma. Is it more taxes? Is 
it more debt? Is it both? All three op-
tions mean more inflation hitting fam-
ilies across America and hitting things 
like the front page of the New York 
Times, where they talk about it as a 
wallop to the wallet.

October 26, 2021 
recognize Private First Class McQueen 
as a Kentucky hero who fought and 
died defending our sacred freedoms and 
honor the steadfast family members 
and public servants who brought him 
home. 
McQueen was only 20 years old when, 
as part of Operation Dragoon, he and 
his platoon landed in the Rhone Valley 
to liberate France from its German oc-
cupiers. Facing stiff resistance and 
heavy fire, his unit scattered across 
the countryside. By the time the 
smoke cleared and the enemy re-
treated, McQueen was lost. 
Two 
years 
later, 
the 
American 
Graves Registration Command recov-
ered a soldier’s body from a farmyard 
in the area where McQueen had gone 
missing. Local authorities could not 
verify the soldier’s identity, so he was 
reburied in an anonymous grave in 
Normandy. Back home in Jackson 
County, the McQueen family prayed 
their lost son would be found. 
Last week, those prayers were finally 
answered. With the help of new DNA 
technology, the Defense POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency identified the body as 
Berton McQueen’s. They sent him 
home to Jackson County, where he is 
now buried next to the church where he 
was baptized, nearly a century earlier. 
With bagpipes and bugles playing, an 
honor guard marching, and the ex-
tended McQueen family gathered to-
gether 
again, 
Private 
First 
Class 
Berton McQueen was finally given the 
hero’s return he deserved. 
Our Nation’s military is diligent in 
finding and honoring its missing serv-
icemembers. All over Kentucky and 
across the country, the POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency has reunited lost sons 
and daughters with their loved ones. 
This program offers important help to 
grieving families and honors our coun-
try’s most sacred obligation to those 
who serve. The Agency’s motto is ‘‘ful-
filling our nation’s promise,’’ and, as 
the 
McQueen 
family’s 
story 
dem-
onstrates, they go to extraordinary 
lengths to carry out that creed. 
The Lexington Herald-Leader pub-
lished a comprehensive account of Pri-
vate First Class Berton McQueen’s life 
and journey in a recent article. I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
the 
article 
be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Lexington Herald-Leader, October 17, 
2021] 
‘I’VE
WAITED
FOR
THIS.’ KENTUCKY
WWII 
SOLDIER UNIDENTIFIED FOR DECADES COMES 
HOME 
Nannie McQueen was desperate to find out 
what had happened to her son in World War 
II. 
Army Pfc. Berton J. McQueen had been 
badly wounded by artillery fire while his 
unit was fighting German troops near a 
small town in France in November 1944. 
He died at an aid station set up in a barn, 
and amid the chaos of war, someone buried 
him in a garden. 
American troops didn’t recover his body 
until after the war in Europe ended months 
later, and he couldn’t be identified. 
The Army notified McQueen’s parents in 
Jackson County that he was listed as killed 
in action, but with few details and no one to 
bury, his mother couldn’t accept it. 
She wrote letters to soldiers who served 
with him to try to figure out what had hap-
pened to him and put advertisements in a 
farming magazine and other publications 
seeking information, said his niece, Gene-
vieve Palm. 
When her grandmother went to town, she 
left the door at her house unlocked so her 
son could get in if he came home, Palm said. 
‘‘She couldn’t give up,’’ Palm said of her 
grandmother. 
‘‘I can’t imagine what kind of torture that 
would have been.’’ 
Now, Berton McQueen is home. 
Based 
on 
historical 
research, 
dental 
records and analysis of DNA samples from 
Palm and other family members, officials 
with 
the 
Defense 
POW/MIA 
Accounting 
Agency identified the body recovered from 
the garden in France as McQueen, according 
to a news release. 
McQueen was accounted for in July, more 
than 76 years after he was killed at age 20. 
He was reburied Saturday with full mili-
tary honors in Jackson County, in the hill-
side cemetery at the Wind Cave Baptist 
Church. McQueen attended the small wooden 
church as a boy and was baptized in a creek 
nearby. 
A bugler played ‘‘Taps,’’ and a bagpiper 
played ‘‘Amazing Grace’’ before members of 
the honor guard fired a 21–gun salute and 
folded the flag from his casket to give to his 
family. 
McQueen was raised on a small farm in the 
Wind Cave community, the youngest of 
seven children of John and Nancy Jane 
‘‘Nannie’’ McQueen, said Palm, whose moth-
er was one of Berton McQueen’s sisters. 
Like thousands of others who grew up on 
Kentucky farms in those days, McQueen 
moved to Indiana to find work. He was living 
in Connersville when he was drafted, Palm 
said. 
McQueen was wounded fighting in Italy in 
February 1944, spending 11 weeks in the hos-
pital, and was wounded again in August 1944, 
spending several more weeks in the hospital. 
His family hoped he would come home, but 
McQueen wanted to finish the job. He be-
lieved that if the U.S. and allies didn’t carry 
the fight to the Nazis in Europe, the war 
would come to America, said Palm, who has 
letters he sent to his family. 
‘‘He felt a strong duty,’’ Palm said. ‘‘He 
said, ‘I will come home when the rest do.’ ’’ 
McQueen landed in southern France in Au-
gust 1944 as part of Operation Dragoon, push-
ing north through the Rhone Valley to meet 
up with forces that had gone ashore in the 
massive D-Day invasion and then turn to the 
final assault on Germany. 
McQueen saw plenty of combat but didn’t 
write about the horror of war in his letters 
home because he didn’t want to worry his 
parents, Palm said. 
Instead, he wrote about the people and the 
beauty he saw, Palm said, though he did 
mention in one letter in mid–1944 that U.S. 
troops were driving the Germans back. 
‘‘He said, ‘We have’m on the run now,’ ’’ 
Palm said. 
But his unit ran into stiff resistance in a 
battle in a hilly region near the border with 
Germany, according to the Army’s account. 
As German infantry pursued his unit, 
McQueen was going to get more ammunition 
for his machine-gun platoon when he was hit 
by shrapnel. 
One soldier later told Army investigators 
he helped carry McQueen to an aid station, 
and that when he asked later how the badly 
wounded man was doing, he was told 
McQueen had died, Palm said. 
McQueen’s battalion, which suffered heavy 
casualties, was forced to pull back and was 
in ‘‘disarray’’ for a period before regrouping, 
according to an account from the Army, 
Palm said. 
It’s not clear why McQueen went missing 
or who buried him. After German troops 
withdrew a few days later, U.S. troops didn’t 
find his body. 
A woman who lived on the farm later dis-
closed that an American soldier had been 
buried there. The American Graves Registra-
tion Command recovered a body in April 1946 
but couldn’t identify the soldier. 
He was reburied under the designation X– 
6093 at the Normandy American Cemetery in 
Colleville-sur-Mer, 
France, 
until 
science 
could solve the mystery. 
Palm was born 10 years after her uncle died 
but lived close to her grandmother and heard 
stories about him. 
‘‘We really grew up with that grief for her, 
and that loss,’’ said Palm, a retired property 
manager who lives in Laurel County. 
McQueen’s mother died in 1972. Years later, 
the local bank president called Palm’s moth-
er to report there was money in an account 
Nannie McQueen had kept. 
She had been putting money away for her 
son to use when he came home, Palm said. 
Palm read a letter at the church Saturday 
from an Army buddy of McQueen’s that her 
grandmother 
had 
contacted 
just 
before 
Christmas in 1945. 
Louie Hughes said in his letter back to 
McQueen’s 
mother 
that 
McQueen 
often 
talked of his home and his family while he 
was overseas, and that the two of them 
talked about the Bible into the night at 
times. 
McQueen had drawn a sketch of how to get 
to his house in Jackson County in Hughes’ 
Bible so he could visit after the war. 
The two later got assigned to different 
companies, and then Hughes was captured 
and spent 16 ‘‘horrible months’’ in a German 
prison camp, he said, so he hadn’t heard that 
McQueen had been killed before McQueen’s 
mother wrote him. 
He told McQueen’s parents to be brave be-
cause that’s what their son would have want-
ed. The ‘‘brave deeds of such men as Berton’’ 
were the reason ‘‘that we enjoy peace 
today,’’ Hughes wrote. 
Palm wishes her mother had lived to know 
her brother had been identified, but she died 
in 2008. Palm, a Christian, believes her moth-
er and grandmother were reunited with 
McQueen in heaven long ago. 
Family members felt new grief when the 
Army notified them McQueen had been ac-
counted for but were also thankful. 
‘‘I consider it a miracle,’’ Palm said. ‘‘My 
whole lifetime I’ve waited for something like 
this.’’

value is $985 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
This proposed sale will improve Australia’s 
capability to perform anti-surface and anti-
submarine warfare missions along with the 
ability to perform secondary missions in-
cluding vertical replenishment, search and 
rescue, and communications relay. Australia 
will use the enhanced capability as a deter-
rent to regional threats and to strengthen its 
homeland defense. Australia will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing this equipment into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment will 
not alter the basic military balance in the 
region. 
The principal U.S. contractor will be Lock-
heed Martin Rotary and Mission Systems, 
Owego, NY. There are no known offset agree-
ments proposed in connection with this po-
tential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale will 
require U.S. Government and contractor per-
sonnel to visit Australia on a temporary 
basis in conjunction with program technical 
oversight and support requirements, includ-
ing program and technical reviews. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–61 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MH–60R Multi-Mission Helicopter is 
employed primarily for anti-submarine and 
anti-surface warfare missions. The MH–60R 
carries several sensors and data links to en-
hance its ability to work in a network-cen-
tric battle group and as an extension of its 
home ship/main operating base. The mission 
systems consist of the following sensors and 
subsystems: an acoustics system consisting 
of a dipping sonar, sonobuoys, and acoustics 
processor; MultiMode Radar (MMR) with in-
tegrated Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) 
interrogator; Radios with COMSEC; Elec-
tronic Support Measures (ESM); Integrated 
Self-Defense (ISD); and Multi-Spectral Tar-
geting System (MTS). 
a. GPS/PPS/SAASM—Global Positioning 
System provides a space-based Global Navi-
gation Satellite System (GNSS) that has re-
liable location and time information in all 
weather and at all times and anywhere on or 
near the earth when and where there is an 
unobstructed line of sight to four or more 
OPS satellites. Selective Availability/Anti- 
Spoofing Module (SAASM) is used by mili-
tary OPS receivers to allow decryption of 
precision OPS coordinates. In addition, the 
OPS Antenna System (GAS–I) provides pro-
tection from enemy manipulation of the OPS 
system. 
b. The AN/APS–153 multi-mode radar with 
an integrated IFF and Inverse Synthetic Ap-
erture (ISAR) provides target surveillance/ 
detection capability. 
c. The AN/ALQ–210 (ESM) system identifies 
the location of an emitter. The ability of the 
system to identify specific emitters depends 
on the data provided. 
d. The AN/AAS–44C(V) Multi-spectral Tar-
geting System (MTS) operates in day/night 
and adverse weather conditions. Imagery is 
provided by a Forward-Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensor, a color/monochrome day tele-
vision (DTV) camera, and a Low-Light TV 
(LLTV). 
e. Ultra High Frequency/Very High Fre-
quency (UHF/VHF) Radios (ARC 210) contain 
embedded sensitive encryption algorithms 
and keying material. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
5. All defense services listed in this trans-
mittal have been authorized for release and 
export to the Government of Australia.

NATIONAL DISABILITY 
EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, Octo-
ber is National Disability Employment 
Awareness Month. I would like to take 
a moment to honor IFB Solutions, 
headquartered in my hometown of Win-
ston-Salem, NC. IFB Solutions has 
been operating in North Carolina for 
over 85 years and over that time has 
provided employment to thousands of 
blind and visually impaired individ-
uals. 
Over their many decades of oper-
ation, IFB has helped fill the needs of 
the Federal Government with high 
quality products, delivered on time, 
and at a fair market value. 
As we celebrate National Disability 
Employment Awareness month, I ap-
plaud IFB Solutions for their commit-
ment to offering employment opportu-
nities for the blind and visually im-
paired. It is my hope that more em-
ployers will understand the value of 
having a diverse workforce and follow 
suit.

October 26, 2021 
TRIBUTE TO DR. KRISTAPS KEGGI 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor Dr. Kristaps Keggi. 
Dr. Keggi is the epitome of the Amer-
ican dream. He was born in Riga, Lat-
via, and survived World War II as a 
child. He escaped communism on a ref-
ugee ship to immigrate to the United 
States. When he landed on the docks of 
Manhattan, he would go on to finish 
high school and attend college and 
medical school. He graduated from 
Yale University in 1955 and from Yale 
University School of Medicine in 1959. 
Eight years after he arrived in the 
U.S., he raised his right hand and vol-
unteered to serve in the U.S. Army. He 
joined the U.S. Army Medical Service 
and Medical Corps. Dr. Keggi served as 
the orthopedic surgery chief in the 
Third Mobile Army Surgical Hospital— 
MASH—in Vietnam from September 
1965 to June 1966. This was the first 
MASH unit stood up and the first to 
deploy to Vietnam. The 3rd MASH sup-
ported the 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 
1st and 25th Infantry Divisions, and 
countless other units. He left the Army 
with the rank of captain. He is a life 
member of the Veterans of Foreign of 
Wars. 
Dr. Keggi’s service did not stop after 
Vietnam. His battlefield experience 
sharpened his skills. He would go on to 
train generations of orthopedic sur-
geons and win worldwide acclaim for 
orthopedic education and innovation. I 
credit much of my success as an ortho-
pedic surgeon and in life to training 
under Dr. Keggi. 
Dr. Keggi is the founder and the 
president of the Keggi Orthopedic 
Foundation and Orthopedic Exchange 
Program between the United States 
and the former Soviet Republics. This 
program has fostered hundreds of fel-
lows in exchanges in Latvia and Rus-
sia. He even mentored the former 
President of Latvia who was a fellow 
orthopedic surgeon. 
He holds memberships in many schol-
arly societies such as American Ortho-
pedic Association, American Academy 
of Orthopedic Surgeons, American As-
sociation of Hip and Knee Surgeons, 
Society for Arthritic Joint Surgery, 
and Connecticut Academy of Arts and 
Sciences, just to highlight a few. 
He has published over 135 scholarly 
articles on orthopedic medical treat-
ments. He was the senior author of the 
seminal American Academy of Ortho-
pedic Surgeons Instructional Course on 
‘‘Early Care of Severe War Wounds’’ on 
how battlefield wounds should be treat-
ed. He pioneered and popularized the 
less invasive anterior surgical ap-
proach used for total hip replacement. 
Dr. Keggi has been recognized by Best 
Doctors in America starting in 1996. He 
was named in America’s Top Surgeons 
in 2009 through 2017. 
Dr. Keggi has volunteered for many 
charitable endeavors and has been rec-
ognized globally for his contributions 
to medical science and humanity. He 
was honored by his hometown of Wa-
terbury, CT, and the Waterbury Vet-
erans Memorial Committee for his life-
time of service working with and treat-
ing patients with the wounds of war. In 
2020, Dr. Keggi was inducted into the 
Connecticut Veterans Hall of Fame. 
Dr. Keggi’s service embodies every-
thing our country stands for. Every op-
portunity he has been given in the 
U.S., he has given back in full. My wife 
Bobbi and I thank him today for his 
life of service to our military, our vet-
erans, and our Nation.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
COMMEMORATING THE GRAND OL’ 
OPRY’S 5000TH SATURDAY NIGHT 
BROADCAST 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I think I speak for all Ten-
nesseans when I confess that, during 
the COVID–19 pandemic lockdowns, I 
craved the comfort of familiarity. I 
laid newer books and albums aside in 
favor of well-worn classics so close to 
my heart that they, in and of them-
selves, were cherished memories. We 
lost so much during that lonely time, 
but through it all, at least one thing 
remained constant. 
Every Saturday night, when I tuned 
my radio to 650 AM WSM, I heard the 
fiddles and steel guitars that have wel-
comed music lovers into the Grand Ol’ 
Opry’s circle of friends for the past 95 
years. 
On October 30, 2021, the Grand Ol’ 
Opry will celebrate its historic 5000th 
Saturday night broadcast. As most 
country music lovers will tell you, Sat-
urday at the Opry is more than just an 
‘‘experience;’’ it is the foundation of 
the format’s legacy and the endgame 
for those who come to Nashville, TN, 
seeking their place within the ranks of 
country music’s legends. The Saturday 
broadcast has been on the airwaves 
longer than any other broadcast pro-
gram of any medium anywhere in the 
world. It thrived through its expansion 
from radio to television and then to 
digital streaming platforms. It has sur-
vived the Great Depression, World War 
II, multiple global conflicts, civil un-
rest, 
devastating 
natural 
disasters, 
and, now, a once-in-a-lifetime global 
pandemic. 
For 7 months during the spring, sum-
mer, and fall of 2020, while life outside 
the Grand Ol’ Opry House ground to a 
halt, a dedicated skeleton crew of pro-
ducers, 
stagehands, 
and 
performers 
came together to create a socially 
distanced broadcast that was just as 
welcoming and heartfelt as anything a 
live audience would expect to see. 
Today, thankfully, the fans are back in 
their seats, and those who don’t make 
the pilgrimage to Music City tune in 
from home with a newfound apprecia-
tion for the gift of live music. 
It is my privilege to memorialize the 
Opry’s ongoing commitment to ar-
tistry and entertainment and to honor

RECOGNIZING DAYSPRING 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to offer my sincere con-
gratulations to DaySpring on 50 years 
of sharing God’s love through cre-
ativity and expression. 
DaySpring, a Christian cards and e- 
cards, boxed cards, inspirational gifts, 
home decor, and art company, calls 
Siloam Springs, AR, home to its world 
headquarters. We are tremendously 
proud to host this faith-based industry 
in the Natural State and benefit from 
all the stirring and encouraging work 
it does. 
The commitment and continued dedi-
cation DaySpring and its employees 
display in sharing their Christian faith 
through uplifting, inspirational, and 
prayerful formats is a testament to the 
role faith plays in their mission. In a 
time where deep divisions exist within 
our country, its hopeful messages are a 
powerful and effective reminder to 
choose kindness. The work it does 
brings 
Americans 
together 
and 
prompts us to recall that we are all 
created in God’s image and loved by 
our Creator. I am so appreciative for 
its passion to spread God’s love as well 
as the beauty and sincerity that char-
acterizes the products it so thought-
fully creates to deliver that message. 
We are very pleased to have wit-
nessed what DaySpring has accom-
plished over the last five decades. Be-
cause of its hard, intentional work to 
reach people with God’s word, I am cer-
tain more people are leading a life de-
voted to Christ. With a vision to ‘‘see 
every person experience and express 
the life-changing message of God’s 
love,’’ the company has charted a path 
that has kept it focused, relevant, and 
undeniably impactful. 
As Colossians 3:23 says, ‘‘Whatever 
you do, work at it with all your heart, 
as working for the Lord.’’ DaySpring’s 
staff has certainly followed that admo-
nition each and every day for 50 years. 
In the years ahead, I encourage them 
to continue inspiring us to look to our 
Heavenly Father, and to love and help 
one another along the way. 
Americans, now more than ever, are 
in need of this hopeful and sincere mes-
sage. I am confident the guidance and 
direction 
consistently 
provided 
by 
DaySpring will be instrumental as we 
continue teaching and sharing God’s 
word in the years to come.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7367 
October 26, 2021 
sponsors its annual Angels in Adoption 
recognition gala. This event honors in-
dividuals across the Nation who are 
making a difference in the lives of 
young people in need of foster and for-
ever homes. 
As adoptive parents ourselves, the 
dedication and commitment to adop-
tion and foster care by CCAI and every 
Angels in Adoption honoree this year 
are extremely near and dear to the 
hearts of my wife Kris and me. 
I want to recognize the Angels in 
Adoption couple I nominated and who 
are being honored this year. I have 
known Jon and Carol Mielke of Bis-
marck, ND, for many years. Yet I am 
not sure our home community has any 
idea of all they have done to foster 
such vulnerable young children for 
nearly 20 years. 
Jon and Carol became foster parents 
in early 2003, when their daughter was 
in college and their son a senior in high 
school. They made the decision to fos-
ter infants, they said, because they had 
‘‘room in their home and room in their 
hearts.’’ 
To date, they have taken into their 
home some 45 infants. Some were with 
them for only a couple of days. Others 
stayed nearly 3 years. 
Always keeping in mind the main 
goal of foster care is family reunifica-
tion, they have made an effort to re-
main in contact with the biological 
families of these children. Their first 
foster child was a newborn who had 
been abandoned at the bus station. 
They cared for her for 2-and-a-half 
months. This girl, who recently grad-
uated from high school, is one of the 
children with whom Jon and Carol 
have stayed in touch. Another set of 
twins, now teenagers, visited them for 
a week earlier this year. 
Jon was a longtime administrative 
manager for a State agency, and Car-
ol’s profession was accounting. He has 
since retired, and she later became a li-
censed practical nurse, keeping flexible 
work hours to be available for the chil-
dren when they come into their home. 
Because of Jon’s background in legis-
lation and lobbying, he has provided 
testimony on foster care issues before 
the legislature. This has helped bring 
positive statutory changes to some 
State laws. 
Jon and Carol have been active in the 
regional foster care association, with 
Jon serving as president one year. 
They also mentor new foster parents 
and have appeared in media campaigns 
promoting foster care. In 2006, they 
were named North Dakota’s Foster 
Parents of the Year. 
The lifelong impact of the love and 
care they have given to each and every 
baby coming into their home will never 
be accurately measured. And, after 
nearly two decades, they continue to 
remain dedicated to foster care because 
of their unwavering belief they can 
make a difference in the life of a child. 
I join all North Dakotans and the en-
tire Congressional Coalition on Adop-
tion Institute in congratulating and 
honoring Jon and Carol Mielke. We 
thank you for your years of dedication 
and the work you continue to do fos-
tering infants in your home. You are 
exceptionally deserving of recognition 
as Angels in Adoption.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JUSTIN MITCHELL 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we are 
all indebted to the special teachers we 
encountered during our formal edu-
cation: those who made a subject come 
alive for us—perhaps for the very first 
time—and sparked a lifelong interest 
in a subject or in a field of study. 
Today, I want to recognize a Kentucky 
teacher who is doing just that: bring-
ing history and civics education to life 
for students at Franklin-Simpson Mid-
dle School in Franklin, KY. 
How many students are truly inter-
ested in history and civics in the sev-
enth or eighth grade? But motivating 
his students to move beyond memo-
rizing facts and dates is exactly what 
Justin Mitchell is known for. Ask his 
colleagues—or visit his social media 
sites—and you will find that he is wild-
ly creative in his mission to make so-
cial 
studies 
education 
interesting, 
challenging, and relevant. 
Justin Mitchell earned degrees in so-
cial studies and history at Western 
Kentucky University—in my home-
town of Bowling Green—and is now a 
doctoral candidate there. He is a 
McConnell scholar who regularly par-
ticipates in the McConnell Center’s 
Civics Education Program, and he de-
ploys his leadership skills outside of 
the classroom by mentoring students 
at his church. 
While his fellow teachers, students, 
and their families have known for 
years that Justin is an exceptional 
teacher, this year, he was recognized 
by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of 
American History as Kentucky’s His-
tory Teacher of the Year. I am pleased 
to congratulate Justin on this accom-
plishment, to thank him for the impact 
that he is making on his students, and 
to create this permanent tribute to 
him in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of 
the U.S. Senate.∑

REMEMBERING WILLIAM ‘‘BUD’’ 
LACOUNTE 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life of William 
‘‘Bud’’ LaCounte, a distinguished Mon-
tanan and decorated veteran of World 
War II. 
While Bud is no longer with us, his 
legacy lives on. On behalf of myself, 
my fellow Montanans, and all Ameri-
cans, I would like extend our deepest 
gratitude for his service to this Nation. 
Bud’s story is one of incredible cour-
age and sacrifice, having survived both 
American Indian Boarding School and 
D-day. Born in Bainville, MT, where he 
now rests, he was a proud member of 
the Turtle Mountain Tribe of Chippewa 
Indians. At the age of just 6, he en-
dured the unimaginable when was 
taken away from his parents and sent 
to Fort Totten Indian School. 
But his commitment to answering 
the call of duty never faded. And on the 
eve of the Second World War, Bud en-
listed in the U.S. Army. Not long after 
he joined, Bud deployed to France and 
fought bravely in the battle of Omaha 
Beach in Normandy on June 6, 1944. 
After the war, he returned to Mon-
tana and settled into his life in Billings 
as a loving husband, dedicated father 
and grandfather, rancher, dancer, and 
storyteller. While he has since passed, 
his memory and spirit lives on in each 
of us—in his stories, in his children and 
grandchildren, and in his enduring 
service and sacrifice to this Nation. 
I now have the profound honor of pre-
senting Bud’s family with the French 
Legion of Honor Medal for his bravery 
in the line of duty. This medal serves 
as a small token of our country’s ap-
preciation for Bud’s incredible service 
and outstanding character. 
Let us pay a final salute to Bud, who 
represents the very best of this great 
country.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. COONS: 
S. 3075. A bill making appropriations 
for the Department of State, foreign 
operations, and related programs for 
the fiscal year ending September 30, 
2022, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Appropriations. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I come to 
the floor to speak to the fiscal year 
2022 State-Foreign Operations appro-
priations bill. 
Every year as December approaches, 
we finally roll up our sleeves and get 
serious about passing the critical ap-
propriations bills that fund our govern-
ment for the new fiscal year, and this 
year should be no different. We are, in 
fact, already a month into fiscal year 
2022. Until we complete our work on 
the Appropriations Committee, Federal 
Agencies are compelled to run on auto-
pilot—something they can manage for 
a few weeks, even a few months, but it 
creates immense problems for Agencies 
and has grave consequences for every 
State and county and municipality in 
this country if it goes on too long. 
What I am talking about today is the 
grave risk that we will end up with a 
continuing resolution. Now, a con-
tinuing resolution doesn’t sound that 
scary, but it is appropriations-speak 
for doing nothing, for a zombie govern-
ment, for conducting business as if 
time has stopped and nothing has 
changed. 
As the relatively new chairman of 
the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
State and Foreign Operations, I am 
acutely aware that running our govern-
ment on autopilot undermines the abil-
ity of the United States to be a global 
leader, to defend and advance our na-
tional security and foreign interests, 
and to counter the influence and ag-
gression of our competitors and adver-
saries. 
If we were to continue month after 
month through this entire fiscal year 
with no appropriation, what are the 
things that have happened that we 
would fail to respond to? 
Well, tragically, in Ethiopia and in 
Afghanistan, there are humanitarian 
crises unfolding before our eyes, where 
millions are at risk of starvation. In 
Haiti, due to the recent earthquake 
and political changes, armed gangs 
have taken over much of the capital, 
and tens of thousands are homeless. In 
Venezuela, the ongoing crisis with the 
Maduro regime continues to worsen, 
putting 
enormous 
pressure 
on 
its 
neighbors as millions of Venezuelans 
flee to other regions seeking refuge. 
We are also continuing to work to 
vaccinate the world to stop further the 
spread of COVID–19 and prevent the de-
velopment 
of 
even 
more 
deadly 
variants than the Delta variant. 
Last year’s State and Foreign Oper-
ations bill included a small fraction of 
what is now widely recognized as being 
essential to prepare for the next out-
break of a deadly virus, which could be

even more lethal than COVID–19 or 
Ebola and more transmissible. 
A continuing resolution would deny 
the U.S. Government the resources in-
cluded in this year’s bill to lead the 
global pandemic response. 
Now, Mr. President, I will not at-
tempt to go through the entire roughly 
320 pages of this year’s nearly $60 bil-
lion State and Foreign Operations ap-
propriations bill, but I do want to talk 
about, at the top level, some of the 
most important provisions and some of 
the most significant ways in which it 
deals with ongoing challenges in our 
world. 
Last year’s bill included almost noth-
ing to help nations deal with the worst 
impacts of climate change, impacts 
that are occurring with greater fre-
quency and intensity than previously 
predicted. Rising temperatures, severe 
droughts, 
food 
shortages, 
flooding, 
fires, 
and 
other 
extreme 
weather 
events are more and more common 
here in our own country and around 
the world. 
Last year’s bill continued the coun-
terproductive practice of failing to 
meet our assessed dues at the United 
Nations, adding another $200 million in 
our arrears, arrears that today are 
nearly a billion dollars. If we continue 
this another year with a CR, who bene-
fits the most from our delinquency, 
from our absence at the world stage 
and at all the different organizations 
and entities within the United Na-
tions? China. 
China has been methodically paying 
what it owes, expanding its influence, 
and has already surpassed us as the 
largest donor to several different U.N. 
agencies. If you think that doesn’t 
matter, imagine a world in which 
China is the largest contributor, sup-
porter, 
shareholder, 
influencer 
of 
United Nations organizations and has 
the largest number of employees and 
sets the rules and standards at the doz-
ens of U.N. entities that are critical to 
global commerce, to global society, 
and to the rules-based international 
order. 
Last year, our SFOPS bill short-
changed U.S. public diplomacy and 
broadcasting, 
and 
we 
saw 
an 
emboldened Russian Government expel 
Radio Free Europe and all of its staff. 
Last year’s bill did positive things. It 
rejected the Trump administration’s 
proposed deep cuts to State Depart-
ment operations and personnel, but it 
did little to fill the yawning gap caused 
by a hiring freeze and steady attrition 
due to a loss of morale. 
Practically all of our Embassies, our 
consulates, and USAID missions are 
today operating at below—and in some 
cases far below—their authorized staff-
ing, their critically needed capacity. 
Over the last 4 years, I will say that 
our reputation as a stalwart defender 
of democratic values and of human 
rights, a reputation earned over dec-
ades, was tarnished. Reaffirming those 
values and rebuilding our reputation 
requires more than brave speeches and 
good words. It requires investing in the 
staff, in the personnel, in the organiza-
tions and the programs that support 
human rights and that fight for democ-
racy around the world. 
I know Senators of both parties rec-
ognize the imperative of our maintain-
ing our reputation as the world’s lead-
ing democracy, of fully staffing our 
Embassies, of strengthening our alli-
ances, of countering growing Russian 
and Chinese influence, and of main-
taining our world leadership role in 
public health by responding to the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
But what also needs to be recognized 
is that none of this is possible if we 
simply continue funding these require-
ments at last year’s level. The fiscal 
year 2022 State and Foreign Operations 
bill was posted on the Appropriations 
Committee website Monday, and I am 
introducing it as a bill in total today. 
I urge our Republican colleagues to 
work with us to arrive at a top line for 
fiscal year 2022 appropriations, to com-
plete work on this and the other appro-
priations bills, and to avoid a yearlong 
continuing resolution that is in no 
one’s interest. 
This year’s State and Foreign Oper-
ations bill was drafted with input from 
leaders in both parties, which has been 
our 
longstanding 
practice. 
Senator 
GRAHAM of South Carolina, the former 
chairman and now ranking member, 
has been an invaluable partner. He and 
I have traveled to a number of coun-
tries together, and I value his ideas, his 
input, and his priorities and those of 
his staff. 
Many of his ideas are reflected in the 
fiscal year 2022 bill, as are requests of 
many Senators of both parties. Every 
draft of this bill was shared and edited 
by both sides. Neither Senator GRAHAM 
nor I got everything we wanted, nor 
should we expect to. There are things 
that his side opposes; there are things 
that my side wanted that are not in-
cluded because of his objections. 
Contrary to what some have sug-
gested, this was not a partisan process. 
Does this bill differ from what the Re-
publicans would have drafted if they 
were in the majority? Of course. But it 
is, in fact, a compromise, the result of 
disciplined and thorough negotiation 
between both parties. 
We did our best to incorporate the re-
quests of other Senators, regardless of 
party. And if we had included every 
dollar that was asked of us, we would 
need a budget allocation five times the 
amount we were given to spend. That 
alone tells you a great deal about the 
strong bipartisan support for global 
leadership and engagement. 
The 
budget 
allocation 
our 
sub-
committee was given is, in fact, $1.75 
billion below President Biden’s budget 
request, and that made us make even 
tougher budget choices than we ini-
tially imagined. The entire SFOPS 
budget amounts to only 1 percent of 
the Federal budget, contrary to the 
mythology many of us hear out on the 
stump, in townhalls, and in campaign 
events. 
Folks come to us all the time who 
imagine that if we just eliminated for-
eign aid, we would cover the entire 
Federal debt. One percent—1 percent— 
of the Federal budget is dedicated to 
our State Department, our USAID pro-
fessionals, our engagement in world or-
ganizations—all of the good that is 
done on behalf of the United States and 
that strengthens our role in strategic 
and, I would say, moral leadership in 
the world at a time when our allies are 
under unprecedented pressure. 
The fiscal year 2022 State and For-
eign Operations bill provides critically 
needed funds to rebuild the muscles of 
the State Department and USAID, to 
fill vacant personnel positions, to allow 
for diplomats and aid workers to serve 
as professional and dedicated rep-
resentatives 
to 
the 
United 
States 
around the world. 
I will remind you, many of them 
serve in dangerous and remote posts, 
from the Horn of Africa to South Asia 
and Central America. But unlike our 
men and women in uniform, they don’t 
carry weapons to defend themselves. 
They, instead, carry the full faith and 
credit of the United States, our reputa-
tion and our support, and our thanks. 
And there are provisions we should be 
adding to future bills to ensure they 
have the full support they need and de-
serve to have successful careers rep-
resenting us overseas. 
As I mentioned earlier, the clarity 
with which we all see the urgency of 
combating climate change has become 
sharper and sharper as natural disaster 
after natural disaster imposes billions 
of dollars of costs on the American peo-
ple. This bill provides nearly $2 billion 
in proactive investments in key cli-
mate programs to support clean energy 
technologies and help other countries 
adapt to climate change. This should 
be a priority for the Senate and the 
United States. 
There are parts of the world already 
experiencing temperatures that make 
life unbearable, where water scarcity is 
an existential threat, food insecurity is 
increasing, and there is a risk of wide-
spread hunger. 
In coming years, projections are the 
number of migrants driven from their 
home countries by climate change will 
increase dramatically to tens of mil-
lions of people moving across the face 
of the world, driven by climate change. 
It is not too late for us to act, but it 
nearly is. And this significant invest-
ment, meeting the President’s budget 
request—in fact, in some areas exceed-
ing it—is, I think, an important signal 
of our commitment to combat climate 
change. 
This bill also provides a billion dol-
lars to support global health security, 
an $800 million increase in the current 
level, recognizing the global pandemic 
in which we are currently struggling to 
provide vaccines and public health sup-
port for the rest of the world. 
It also provides support for a wide 
range of sustained and bipartisan long- 
term global health investments: com-
bating malaria, polio, tuberculosis; for

nutrition, water, and sanitation pro-
grams; and maintaining strong support 
for the PEPFAR Program to combat 
HIV/AIDS, first initiated by President 
George Bush and sustained by his suc-
cessor administrations. 
This bill also maintains critical sup-
port for vital allies and partners, for 
the nations of Israel and Jordan and 
other allies throughout the world, and 
it pays our commitments to inter-
national organizations like NATO and 
the IAEA. It provides funds to continue 
our leadership role as the world’s larg-
est contributor to the U.N. World Food 
Programme, which won the Nobel 
Peace Prize last year for the critical, 
lifesaving difference they have made in 
feeding the world’s most vulnerable 
people and in responding to the current 
global humanitarian crisis. 
This bill includes a nearly $150 mil-
lion increase for vital programs in Cen-
tral America to address poverty, vio-
lence, and other root causes of migra-
tion while also attempting to address 
the rampant corruption and impunity 
within the governments of the coun-
tries of Central America with which we 
look to partner. 
There is also a critical new invest-
ment here I want to point out briefly. 
The U.S. International Development 
Finance 
Corporation, 
something 
a 
number of us have a hand in crafting, 
will have an increased budget by more 
than $100 million to support private- 
sector 
investment 
in 
development 
overseas with standards that are high-
er, that are more transparent in terms 
of 
labor, 
environment, 
and 
fiscal 
soundness and transparency. I think 
this is critical for us to combat rising 
Chinese influence through the Belt and 
Road Initiative and for the United 
States to have a new tool to partner 
with our closest allies in development 
finance. 
This also provides $900 million to the 
Millennium Challenge Corporation, an-
other initiative of the Bush adminis-
tration sustained by its successors, 
that has demonstrated that long-term 
compacts with clear standards and 
clear metrics can contribute meaning-
fully to development in the Third 
World. 
The bill supports programs to protect 
and promote internet freedom, reli-
gious freedom, and freedom of expres-
sion, all of which are critical ways that 
we don’t just talk about but we show 
our values in the world. 
And it increases funding for pro-
grams to support free and fair elec-
tions, human rights, and democratic 
institutions 
at 
a 
time 
when 
authoritarianism is gaining ground in 
nearly every region of the world. No 
country has the ability to match the 
United States when it comes to stand-
ing up to ruthless dictators, whether in 
Burma, in Russia, or in Iran, and peo-
ple everywhere are counting on us to 
do so. 
This bill also prioritizes funding for 
programs 
to 
combat 
transnational 
crime and corruption and to hold ac-
countable foreign officials who enrich 
themselves at the expense of their own 
people, and it provides funding to help 
countries—especially those hardest hit 
by 
the 
pandemic—to 
reform 
and 
strengthen struggling economies. And, 
for the first time, it highlights the 
need for greater engagement through 
diplomacies and specific programs in 
the Arctic region, which is rapidly be-
coming an area of focus and of stra-
tegic competition. 
Whether it is investing in rebuilding 
the professional staff at the State De-
partment and USAID or whether it is 
shoring up our alliances and our part-
nerships with key allies or reasserting 
U.S. diplomatic leadership in inter-
national organizations, it is the fund-
ing and the authorities in this bill that 
will enable us to remain and to 
strengthen our role as a global leader. 
As President Biden leaves to go to 
the G20, to go to COP26, the global cli-
mate summit in Glasgow, we should be 
sending a strong signal of support. We 
should be taking up and passing this 
bill. 
If we simply remain on autopilot, if 
we doom the Agencies I have spoken 
about in my brief remarks today to a 
zombie year on autopilot, we will 
weaken our standing in the world. We 
will take a critical tool out of the tool-
kit of our President, who I believe 
many of us supported because of his 
ability to represent us well on the 
world stage and in recognition of the 
many crises that confront our world 
today. 
Appropriating funds for the Federal 
Government is among our most impor-
tant responsibilities under article I of 
our Constitution. It is not something 
to be casual or blase or nonchalant 
about. It is something to take up, to 
seriously debate, and to act on. 
With just 6 weeks before the con-
tinuing resolution runs out, it is time 
for us to act on the State and Foreign 
Operations bill and all the other fiscal 
2022 appropriations bills so we can 
avoid a zombie government under a 
continuing resolution and demonstrate 
that the Senate of the United States 
can still legislate in the best interests 
of the American people. 
Thank you.

SENATE RESOLUTION 427—TO COM-
MEMORATE THE 30-YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
1991 
PARIS 
PEACE AGREEMENTS WITH CAM-
BODIA AND TO CALL UPON ALL 
SIGNATORIES TO THOSE AGREE-
MENTS TO FULFILL THEIR COM-
MITMENTS TO SECURE A PEACE-
FUL, PROSPEROUS, DEMOCRATIC, 
AND SOVEREIGN CAMBODIA 
Mr. MARKEY (for himself, Mr. ROM-
NEY, Mr. MENENDEZ, and Mr. RISCH) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 427 
Whereas the agreements signed at the 
Paris Conference on Cambodia on October 23, 
1991 (commonly referred to as the ‘‘Paris 
Peace Agreements’’), led to the end of a bru-
tal 12-year civil war in Cambodia and paved 
the way to national reconciliation through 
the expulsion of foreign forces and the guar-
antee of the right to self-determination of 
the Cambodian people through free and fair 
elections; 
Whereas the Paris Peace Agreements rep-
resented a landmark achievement for the 
Cambodian people, Cambodia, the inter-
national community, and the United States 
and are the foundation for the peace enjoyed 
by Cambodia today; 
Whereas the United States was a party to 
the negotiation and conclusion of the Paris 
Peace Agreements, which also included lead-
ership and participation of a broad inter-
national coalition composed of Australia, 
Brunei, Canada, China, France, India, Indo-
nesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, the Phil-
ippines, Singapore, the former Union of So-
viet Socialist Republics, the United King-
dom, Vietnam, the former Yugoslavia, and 
Cambodia; 
Whereas the Paris Peace Agreements au-
thorized the creation of the United Nations 
Transitional 
Authority 
in 
Cambodia 
(UNTAC), which was an unprecedented inter-
national effort to help administer Cambodia 
and guide the country as it emerged from 
years of civil war; 
Whereas the United Nations Transitional 
Authority in Cambodia successfully pre-
vented the resurgence of the genocidal 
Khmer Rouge, created the atmosphere for 
national reconciliation, was instrumental to 
the return of hundreds of thousands of Cam-
bodian refugees to their homes, and laid the 
groundwork for a new Constitution and free 
and fair elections that featured broad par-
ticipation; 
Whereas, since the United Nations Secu-
rity Council established the United Nations 
Transitional Authority in Cambodia through 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 
745 in 1992, the United States and the inter-
national community have continued to sup-
port the peace, security, and prosperity of 
Cambodia, as demonstrated through the de-
livery by the United States of more than 
$1,500,000,000 in development assistance and 
more than $3,000,000,000 in total assistance to 
Cambodia, according to the Department of 
State; 
Whereas the implementation of the Paris 
Peace Agreements established institutions 
critical to peace, development, and freedom 
in Cambodia, including the beginnings of a 
vibrant civil society and independent media; 
Whereas the Paris Peace Agreements set 
forth a democratic process for the election of 
a constituent assembly that adopted the 
Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia, 
which obligates the Kingdom to ‘‘respect 
human rights as stipulated in the United Na-
tions Charter, the Universal Declaration of 
Human rights, the covenants and conven-
tions related to human rights, women’s and 
children’s rights’’; 
Whereas the actions of Prime Minister Hun 
Sen and the ruling Cambodian People’s 
Party since 1993 to consolidate power, which 
have infringed on the fundamental rights 
and freedoms of the Cambodian people and 
culminated in the banning of the Cambodia 
National Rescue Party (CNRP) in 2017, effec-
tively turning Cambodia into a one-party 
state, violate the Constitution of the King-
dom of Cambodia and challenge the full im-
plementation of the Paris Peace Agree-
ments; 
Whereas the reported use of Cambodia’s 
Ream Naval Base on the Gulf of Thailand by

October 26, 2021 
the People’s Republic of China would be in-
consistent with Cambodia’s status of neu-
trality under the Paris Peace Agreements, 
which the Constitution of the Kingdom of 
Cambodia later defined, in part, as ‘‘not per-
mit(ting) any foreign military base on its 
territory’’; and 
Whereas the politically motivated arrests 
of more than 150 people associated with the 
Cambodia National Rescue Party since June 
2019 and irregular judicial prosecutions of de-
tainees further undermine the intent of the 
Paris Peace Agreements to allow full polit-
ical participation in free and fair elections: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) remains committed to the Cambodian 
people and their aspirations for a more 
peaceful, prosperous, democratic, and sov-
ereign country, as envisioned in the agree-
ments signed at the Paris Conference on 
Cambodia on October 23, 1991 (commonly re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Paris Peace Agreements’’), 
with the support of the international com-
munity; 
(2) calls upon all signatories of the Paris 
Peace 
Agreements, 
including 
Cambodian 
stakeholders, to reaffirm their commitments 
under the Agreements, the fulfillment of 
which will advance the peace, prosperity, 
rights, and freedoms enjoyed by the Cam-
bodian people 30 years after the signing of 
the Agreements; and 
(3) emphasizes the need for the Govern-
ment of Cambodia— 
(A) to commit to free and fair multiparty 
elections in the upcoming communal elec-
tions in 2022 and national elections in 2023 as 
an expression of its commitment to the self- 
determination of the Cambodian people; 
(B) to uphold its commitments to pro-
tecting human rights, democratic institu-
tions, and free and fair elections; 
(C) to dismiss all politically motivated 
charges, prosecutions, and sentencings of the 
opposition, journalists, and civil society ac-
tivists; and 
(D) to refrain from actions that violate its 
status of neutrality.

SENATE RESOLUTION 428—RECOG-
NIZING OCTOBER 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL PRINCIPALS MONTH’’ 
Ms. SMITH (for herself, Ms. COLLINS, 
Mr. KING, Ms. HIRONO, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. 
BRAUN, Mr. BOOZMAN, and Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 428 
Whereas the National Association of Sec-
ondary School Principals, the National Asso-
ciation of Elementary School Principals, and 
the American Federation of School Adminis-
trators have declared October 2021 to be ‘‘Na-
tional Principals Month’’; 
Whereas principals are educational vision-
aries, instructional and assessment leaders, 
disciplinarians, community builders, budget 
analysts, facilities managers, and adminis-
trators of legal and contractual obligations; 
Whereas principals work collaboratively 
with teachers and parents to develop and im-
plement clear missions, high curriculum 
standards, and performance goals; 
Whereas principals create school environ-
ments that facilitate great teaching and 
learning and continuous school improve-
ment; 
Whereas principals demonstrate leadership 
and play important roles in meeting the 
needs of students, families, and communities 
while responding to the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic; 
Whereas the vision, actions, and dedication 
of principals provide the mobilizing force be-
hind any school improvement effort; and 
Whereas the celebration of National Prin-
cipals 
Month 
would 
honor 
elementary 
school, middle school, and high school prin-
cipals and recognize the importance of prin-
cipals in ensuring that every child has access 
to a high-quality education: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes October 2021 as ‘‘National 
Principals Month’’; 
(2) honors the contributions of principals 
in elementary schools, middle schools, and 
high schools in the United States; and 
(3) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Principals Month.

At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
Subtitle H—Otto Warmbier Countering North 
Korean Censorship and Surveillance Act of 
2021 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Otto 
Warmbier Countering North Korean Censor-
ship and Surveillance Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The information landscape in North 
Korea is the most repressive in the world, 
consistently ranking last or near-last in the 
annual World Press Freedom Index. 
(2) Under the brutal rule of Kim Jung Un, 
the country’s leader since 2012, the North Ko-
rean regime has tightened controls on access 
to information, as well as enacted harsh pun-
ishments for consumers of outside media, in-
cluding sentencing to time in a concentra-
tion camp and a maximum penalty of death. 
(3) Such repressive and unjust laws sur-
rounding information in North Korea re-
sulted in the death of 22-year-old United 
States citizen and university student Otto 
Warmbier, who had traveled to North Korea 
in December 2015 as part of a guided tour. 
(4) Otto Warmbier was unjustly arrested, 
sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, and se-
verely mistreated at the hands of North Ko-
rean officials. While in captivity, Otto 
Warmbier suffered a serious medical emer-
gency that placed him into a comatose state. 
Otto Warmbier was comatose upon his re-
lease in June 2017 and died 6 days later. 
(5) Despite increased penalties for posses-
sion and viewership of foreign media, the 
people of North Korean have increased their 
desire for foreign media content, according 
to a survey of 200 defectors concluding that 
90 percent had watched South Korean or 
other foreign media before defecting. 
(6) On March 23, 2021, in an annual resolu-
tion, the United Nations General Assembly 
condemned ‘‘the long-standing and ongoing 
systematic, widespread and gross violations 
of human rights in the Democratic People’s 
Republic of Korea’’ and expressed grave con-
cern at, among other things, ‘‘the denial of 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience, 
and religion . . . and of the rights to freedom 
of opinion, expression, and association, both 
online and offline, which is enforced through 
an absolute monopoly on information and 
total control over organized social life, and 
arbitrary and unlawful state surveillance 
that permeates the private lives of all citi-
zens’’. 
(7) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu caused extensive 
damage to 15 broadcast antennas used by the 
United States Agency for Global Media in 
Asia, resulting in reduced programming to 
North Korea. The United States Agency for 
Global Media has rebuilt 5 of the 15 antenna 
systems as of June 2021. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) in the event of a crisis situation, par-
ticularly where information pertaining to 
the crisis is being actively censored or a 
false narrative is being put forward, the

crease its broadcasting capability to deliver 
fact-based information to audiences, includ-
ing those in North Korea; and 
(2) the United States International Broad-
casting Surge Capacity Fund is already au-
thorized under section 316 of the United 
States International Broadcasting Act of 
1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216), and expanded authority 
to transfer unobligated balances from ex-
pired accounts of the United States Agency 
for Global Media would enable the Agency to 
more nimbly respond to crises.

North Korea to safely create, access, and 
share digital and non-digital news without 
fear of repressive censorship, surveillance, or 
penalties under law; and 
(3) to foster and innovate new technologies 
to counter North Korea’s state-sponsored re-
pressive surveillance and censorship by ad-
vancing 
internet 
freedom 
tools, 
tech-
nologies, and new approaches.

cials of foreign governments that assist, fa-
cilitate, or aid North Korea’s repressive cen-
sorship and surveillance state. 
(4) A review of existing public-private part-
nerships that provide circumvention tech-
nology and an assessment of the feasibility 
and utility of new tools to increase free ex-
pression, circumvent censorship, and ob-
struct 
repressive 
surveillance 
in 
North 
Korea.

quired for current United States Government 
programs and activities to provide access for 
the people of North Korea to a diverse range

Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216) has 
operated to respond to crisis situations in 
the past, and how authority to transfer un-
obligated balances from expired accounts 
would help the United States Agency for 
Global Media in crisis situations in the fu-
ture. 
(10) A detailed plan for how the authoriza-

lowing findings: 
(1) The Baltic countries are particularly 
vulnerable to continued aggression from the 
Russian Federation, including through in-
creased air provocations, military build ups 
in the Baltic region, disinformation cam-
paigns, cyberattacks, and other forms of in-
timidation. 
(2) Since fiscal year 2018, the United States 
has allocated over $498,965,000 in Department 
of Defense partner capacity funding for the 
Baltic countries, including over $219,000,000 
for the Baltic Security Initiative pursuant to 
sections 332 and 333 of title 10, United States 
Code, for security assistance to Baltic coun-
tries with respect to— 
(A) air defense; 
(B) maritime situational awareness; 
(C) ammunition; 
(D) command, control, communications, 
computers, intelligence, surveillance, and re-
connaissance; 
(E) anti-tank capability; 
(F) special forces; and

the comprehensive Baltic defense assessment 
required by section 1246 of the National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 
(Public Law 116–92; 133 Stat. 1661) and has 
recommended continued robust, comprehen-
sive investment in Baltic security efforts 
based on that assessment. 
(b) SENSE OF SENATE.—It is the sense of the 
Senate that— 
(1) the security of the Baltic region is cru-
cial to the security of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization alliance and the contin-
ued provision of security assistance to the 
Baltic countries is critical to ensuring deter-
rence against Russian aggression and bol-
stering the security of North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization allies; and 
(2) the Senate strongly supports robust as-
sistance to accomplish United States stra-
tegic objectives, including by providing as-
sistance to the Baltic countries through the 
Baltic Security Initiative.

SEC. 744. GRANT PROGRAM FOR INCREASED CO-
OPERATION 
ON 
POST-TRAUMATIC 
STRESS DISORDER RESEARCH BE-
TWEEN UNITED STATES AND ISRAEL. 
(a) FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(A) The Department of Veterans Affairs re-
ports that between 11 and 20 percent of vet-
erans who served in Operation Iraqi Freedom 
and Operation Enduring Freedom have post- 
traumatic stress disorder (in this paragraph 
referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’) in a given year. In 
addition, that figure amounts to about 12 
percent of Gulf War veterans and up to 30 
percent of Vietnam veterans. 
(B) The Department of Veterans Affairs re-
ports that among women veterans of the 
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 20 
percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. 
(C) It is thought that 70 percent of individ-
uals in the United States have experienced 
at least one traumatic event in their life-
time, and approximately 20 percent of those 
individuals have struggled or continue to 
struggle with symptoms of PTSD. 
(D) Studies show that PTSD has links to 
homelessness and substance abuse in the 
United States. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs estimates that approximately 11 per-
cent of the homeless population are veterans 
and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services 
Administration 
estimates 
that 
about seven percent of veterans have a sub-
stance abuse disorder. 
(E) Our ally Israel, under constant attack 
from terrorist groups, experiences similar 
issues with Israeli veterans facing symptoms 
of PTSD. The National Center for Traumatic 
Stress and Resilience at Tel Aviv University 
found that five to eight percent of combat 
soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and 
during wartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 
percent. 
(F) Current treatment options in the 
United States focus on cognitive therapy, ex-
posure therapy, or eye movement desen-
sitization and reprocessing, but the United 
States must continue to look for more effec-
tive treatments. Several leading hospitals, 
academic institutions, and nonprofit organi-
zations in Israel dedicate research and serv-
ices to treating PTSD. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Defense, act-
ing through the Psychological Health and 
Traumatic Brain Injury Research Program, 
should seek to explore scientific collabora-
tion between academic institutions and non-
profit research entities in the United States 
and institutions in Israel with expertise in 
researching, diagnosing, and treating post- 
traumatic stress disorder. 
(b) GRANT PROGRAM.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense, 
in coordination with the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs and the Secretary of State, 
shall award grants to eligible entities to 
carry out collaborative research between the 
United States and Israel with respect to 
post-traumatic stress disorders. 
(2) AGREEMENT.—The Secretary of Defense 
shall carry out the grant program under this 
section in accordance with the Agreement on 
the United States-Israel binational science 
foundation with exchange of letters, signed 
at New York September 27, 1972, and entered 
into force on September 27, 1972. 
(c) ELIGIBLE ENTITIES.—To be eligible to 
receive a grant under this section, an entity 
shall be an academic institution or a non-
profit entity located in the United States. 
(d) AWARD.—The Secretary shall award 
grants under this section to eligible entities 
that— 
(1) carry out a research project that— 
(A) addresses a requirement in the area of 
post-traumatic stress disorders that the Sec-
retary determines appropriate to research 
using such grant; and 
(B) is conducted by the eligible entity and 
an entity in Israel under a joint research 
agreement; and 
(2) meet such other criteria that the Sec-
retary may establish. 
(e) APPLICATION.—To be eligible to receive 
a grant under this section, an eligible entity 
shall submit an application to the Secretary 
at such time, in such manner, and con-
taining such commitments and information 
as the Secretary may require. 
(f) GIFT AUTHORITY.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary may ac-
cept, hold, and administer any gift of money 
made on the condition that the gift be used 
for the purpose of the grant program under 
this section. 
(2) DEPOSIT.—Gifts of money accepted 
under paragraph (1) shall be deposited in the 
Treasury in the Department of Defense Gen-
eral Gift Fund and shall be available, subject 
to appropriation, without fiscal year limita-
tion.

referred to as ‘‘PTSD’’) in a given year. In 
addition, that figure amounts to about 12 
percent of Gulf War veterans and up to 30 
percent of Vietnam veterans. 
(B) The Department of Veterans Affairs re-
ports that among women veterans of the 
conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, almost 20 
percent have been diagnosed with PTSD. 
(C) It is thought that 70 percent of individ-
uals in the United States have experienced 
at least one traumatic event in their life-
time, and approximately 20 percent of those 
individuals have struggled or continue to 
struggle with symptoms of PTSD. 
(D) Studies show that PTSD has links to 
homelessness and substance abuse in the 
United States. The Department of Veterans 
Affairs estimates that approximately 11 per-
cent of the homeless population are veterans 
and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services 
Administration 
estimates 
that 
about seven percent of veterans have a sub-
stance abuse disorder. 
(E) Our ally Israel, under constant attack 
from terrorist groups, experiences similar 
issues with Israeli veterans facing symptoms 
of PTSD. The National Center for Traumatic 
Stress and Resilience at Tel Aviv University 
found that five to eight percent of combat 
soldiers experience some form of PTSD, and 
during wartime, that figure rises to 15 to 20 
percent. 
(F) Current treatment options in the 
United States focus on cognitive therapy, ex-
posure therapy, or eye movement desen-
sitization and reprocessing, but the United 
States must continue to look for more effec-
tive treatments. Several leading hospitals, 
academic institutions, and nonprofit organi-
zations in Israel dedicate research and serv-
ices to treating PTSD. 
(2) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Defense, act-
ing through the Psychological Health and 
Traumatic Brain Injury Research Program, 
should seek to explore scientific collabora-
tion between academic institutions and non-
profit research entities in the United States 
and institutions in Israel with expertise in 
researching, diagnosing, and treating post- 
traumatic stress disorder. 
(b) GRANT PROGRAM.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Defense, 
in coordination with the Secretary of Vet-
erans Affairs and the Secretary of State,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United 
States Army Rangers Veterans of World War 
II Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act— 
(1) the term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Sec-
retary of the Treasury; and 
(2) the term ‘‘United States Army Rangers 
Veteran of World War II’’ means any indi-
vidual who— 
(A) served in the Armed Forces— 
(i) honorably; 
(ii) in an active duty status; and 
(iii) at any time during the period begin-
ning on June 19, 1942, and ending on Sep-
tember 2, 1945; and 
(B) was assigned to a Ranger Battalion of 
the Army at any time during the period de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(iii). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In World War II, the Army formed 6 
Ranger Battalions and 1 provisional bat-
talion. All members of the Ranger Battalions 
were volunteers. The initial concept of Rang-
er units drew from the British method of 
using highly trained ‘‘commando’’ units and 
the military tradition of the United States 
of utilizing light infantry for scouting and 
raiding operations. 
(2) The Ranger Battalions of World War II 
consisted of— 
(A) the 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on June 19, 1942, in 
Northern Ireland; 
(B) the 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on April 1, 1943, at Camp 
Forrest, Tennessee; 
(C) the 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) activated as provisional on May 21, 1943, 
in North Africa; and 
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and con-
currently consolidated with the provisional 
unit described in clause (i); 
(D) the 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) activated as provisional on May 29, 1943, 
in North Africa; and 
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and con-
currently consolidated with the provisional 
unit described in clause (i); 
(E) the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on September 1, 1943, at 
Camp Forrest, Tennessee; 
(F) the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) originally activated on January 20, 1941, 
at Fort Lewis, Washington, as the 98th Field 
Artillery Battalion; and 
(ii) converted and redesignated on Sep-
tember 26, 1944, as the 6th Ranger Infantry 
Battalion; and 
(G) the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion, a 
provisional Army National Guard unit that 
was— 
(i) activated on December 20, 1942, at 
Tidworth Barracks, England; and 
(ii) disbanded on October 18, 1943. 
(3) The first combat operations of Army 
Rangers occurred on August 19, 1942, when 50 
Rangers took part in the British-Canadian 
raid on the French coastal town of Dieppe. 
(4) The 1st Ranger Battalion, under the 
leadership of Major William O. Darby, was 
used in full strength during the landings at 
Arsew, Algeria, during the North African 
campaign. Due to the success of the Rangers 
in several difficult battles, particularly at El 
Guettar in March and April of 1943, 2 addi-
tional Ranger Battalions were organized in 
North Africa. 
(5) During the North African campaign, the 
1st Ranger Battalion was awarded battle 
honors for its actions in Tunisia. On March 
20, 1943, the Battalion penetrated enemy

lines and captured the position Djebel el Ank 
in a nighttime attack, taking more than 200 
prisoners. Two days later, the battalion was 
attacked by the 10th Panzer division of the 
German Afrika Korps and, despite heavy 
losses, continued to defend its position. The 
following day, the 1st Battalion counter-
attacked to clear high ground overlooking 
the positions held by the Armed Forces. 
These actions demonstrated the ability of 
the Rangers to fight in difficult terrain and 
the courage to endure despite being out-
numbered and exposed to heavy enemy fire. 
(6) The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion 
was formed from volunteers drawn from the 
29th Infantry Division stationed in England 
in the fall of 1942. The Battalion was acti-
vated on December 20, 1942, and accompanied 
British commandos on 3 small-scale raids in 
Norway. Nineteen members of the 29th Rang-
er Battalion conducted a raid on a German 
radar site in France on the night of Sep-
tember 3, 1943. After that raid, the 29th 
Ranger Battalion was disbanded because new 
Ranger units, the 2d and 5th Battalions, were 
being formed. 
(7) During the summer and fall of 1943, the 
1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions were heav-
ily involved in the campaign in Sicily and 
the landings in Italy. The 1st and 4th Ranger 
Battalions conducted a night amphibious 
landing in Sicily and secured the landing 
beaches for the main force. The 3d Battalion 
landed separately at Licata, Sicily, and was 
able to silence gun positions on an 82-foot 
cliff overlooking the invasion beaches. 
(8) During the invasion of Italy, the 1st and 
4th Ranger Battalions landed at Maiori with 
the mission of seizing the high ground and 
protecting the flank of the remainder of the 
main landing by the United States. Enemy 
forces in the area were estimated to out-
number the Rangers by approximately 8 to 1. 
Despite these odds, the Rangers took the po-
sition and held off 7 enemy counterattacks. 
(9) After the invasion of Italy, Rangers 
continued to be used, often in night attacks, 
to seize key terrain ahead of the advancing 
Allied forces. At the Anzio beachhead, the 
majority of the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Bat-
talions sustained heavy casualties after 
being cut off behind German lines. The Rang-
ers had planned to infiltrate German posi-
tions under the cover of darkness and make 
a dawn attack on a critical road junction but 
were pinned down by enemy tanks and an 
elite German paratrooper unit. After 12 
hours of desperate fighting and a failed relief 
attempt, the majority of the Ranger force 
was killed, wounded, or captured. Only 6 
Rangers from the 1st and 3d Battalions, out 
of more than 767 men, returned to friendly 
lines. The 4th Battalion, which had been in 
reserve, also suffered 60 killed and 120 
wounded out of 550 men. These 3 battalions 
were inactivated and the survivors were 
transferred to other units. 
(10) In the United States, and later in Scot-
land, the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were 
formed to undertake operations in Western 
Europe. Those Battalions were engaged on D- 
Day, assaulting German positions at the 
Pointe du Hoc coastal battery, and remained 
in combat through September of 1944. Spe-
cifically, Rangers in the 2d Battalion, under 
the command of Lieutenant Colonel James 
E. Rudder— 
(A) overcame mines, machine gun fire, and 
enemy artillery while scaling the 100-foot 
high cliffs at Pointe du Hoc; 
(B) held against intense German efforts to 
retake the position; and 
(C) after reaching the top of the cliffs, 
moved inland roughly 1 mile and sustained 
heavy casualties while searching for, and ul-
timately destroying, a German heavy artil-
lery battery. 
(11) During June, July, and August of 1944, 
the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were en-
gaged in the campaign in Brest, which in-
cluded close-range fighting in hedgerows and 
numerous villages. Later, in operations in 
Western Germany, the Battalions were fre-
quently used to attack in darkness and gain 
vital positions to pave the way for the main 
Army attacks. 
(12) During the final drive into Germany in 
late February and early March 1945, the 5th 
Ranger Battalion was cited for battle honors 
for outstanding performance. Under the 
cover of darkness, the unit drove into Ger-
man lines and blocked the main German sup-
ply route in the sector. The Germans at-
tacked the position of the Rangers from both 
sides, resulting in heavy Ranger casualties 
during 5 days of fighting. As a result of the 
actions of the Rangers, the main Army at-
tack was able to overcome German defenses 
more easily, occupy the vital city of Trier, 
and reach the Rhine River. 
(13) The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in 
the Pacific. In the most notable exploit of 
the 6th Ranger Battalion, in January and 
February of 1945, the Battalion formed the 
nucleus of a rescue force that liberated more 
than 500 Allied prisoners, including prisoners 
from the United States, from the Caba-
natuan prisoner of war camp in the Phil-
ippines. With the help of local Filipino gue-
rillas, the Rangers, led by Lieutenant Colo-
nel Henry A. Mucci, demonstrated extraor-
dinary heroism by infiltrating Japanese-held 
territory to reach the prisoners of war and 
prevent them from being killed by the Japa-
nese. After a 25-mile march at night through 
the jungle, the unit killed all Japanese sen-
tries with no loss of life of the prisoners of 
war. The unit successfully returned to Amer-
ican lines having lost only 2 soldiers killed 
and having another 2 wounded.

CHAEL T. PTASIENSKI TO THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor Michael T. 
Ptasienski, the fifth Inspector General of the 
House of Representatives, who is departing 
the House after 13 years of service. 
Mr. Ptasienski was appointed the 5th In-
spector General of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives on February 15, 2018. Prior to his 
appointment, Michael served as the Deputy In-
spector General for Advisory and Administra-
tive Services and, upon joining the House in 
2008, the Director of the Management Advi-
sory Services. Born, raised, and educated in 
the State of Illinois, Michael spent over 15 
years working in consulting and management 
roles in the financial services industry prior to 
joining the House. 
Mr. Ptasienski brought great skill, knowl-
edge, and a cooperative, pragmatic leadership 
style to the Office of Inspector General. Under 
Michael’s leadership and his focus to help im-
prove the operations of the House, the Inspec-
tor General’s Office worked closely and effec-
tively with other House offices to identify risks, 
highlight areas for potential improvement, and 
develop 
reasonable 
and 
sensible 
rec-
ommendations for the benefit of the House. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
Ptasienski for his dedicated service to the 
House, and I urge my colleagues to join me in 
offering warmest wishes for success in his 
life’s endeavors.

CELEBRATING 80 YEARS OF 
MILLER’S BAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Miller’s Bar located in 
Dearborn, Michigan, as they celebrate over 80 
years of service to our community. Their dec-
ades spent as a Dearborn legend are worthy 
of commendation. 
Established 1941 by the George Miller and 
his family, the current owners Dennis and 
Mark Miller give credit to Russell Miller who 
‘‘made it what it is.’’ There’s always a Miller 
around the restaurant, which is open six days 
a week. This old-school Dearborn establish-
ment with the red booths is a local gem, one 
that requires that customers abide by the 
honor system when paying for their meals and 
accepts only cash. Though the honor system 
may be a relic of days past, their reliance on 
honesty and the trust they’ve built with their 
customers is a testament to their status as a 
treasured 
Dearborn 
mainstay. 
For 
years 
they’ve served generations of hungry workers 
and families. 
The restaurant is famous throughout south-
east Michigan and is a popular gathering spot 
for nearby Ford Motor Company employees, 
known for their iconic made-to-order ground 
round burgers served on wax paper. Their 
burger was named one of the top 25 in the 
country by Food & Wine Magazine in 2012 
and named one of the Best Burger Places in 
America by Thrillist in 2018. Among other fans 
include acclaimed food writers from GQ, 
MLive, Click on Detroit, the Wall Street Jour-
nal, Pure Michigan, The Michigan Journal, De-
troit’s Hour Magazine, and even Oprah. 
Miller’s Bar is nothing short of a Dearborn 
icon. A family operation to this day, they have 
grilled for thousands. A place for friends to get 
together, families to share a meal, and to 
catch up on the neighborhood news—we have 
been lucky to have them here at home for the 
past eight decades. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Miller’s Bar. Please 
join me in congratulating them on eight fan-
tastic decades of business. We thank the Mil-
ler family for their commitment to serving our 
neighbors for the past 80 years. We wish 
them the best of luck as this Dearborn main-
stay goes up for sale and new owners take 
over and continue the great tradition that the 
Miller family started long ago.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. JULIA 
NESHEIWAT 
HON. MICHAEL WALTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and career of combat 
veteran 
and 
public 
servant 
Dr. 
Julia 
Nesheiwat, who has devoted her entire life in 
service to this country and by every metric, 
exemplifies duty, honor, and the American 
Dream. 
Born to Ben and Hayat Nesheiwat, Jor-
danian immigrant parents who worked tire-
lessly to provide for her and her four siblings, 
Dr. Nesheiwat graduated from Stetson Univer-
sity. She then went on to earn her M.A. in se-
curity studies from Georgetown University, 
Washington D.C. and a Ph.D. from the Tokyo 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
in 
Japan. 
Dr. 
Nesheiwat is a lifelong member of the Council 
on Foreign Relations and served on the Gov-
erning Advisory Council for the World Eco-
nomic Forum. 
After 
the 
September 
11 
attacks, 
Dr. 
Nesheiwat was immediately deployed in the 
U.S. Army military intelligence corps. She 
served multiple tours in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Free-
dom in Afghanistan and Iraq for which she 
was awarded the Bronze Star Medal. Dr. 
Nesheiwat subsequently was selected to serve 
on the U.S. Presidential Commission on Intel-
ligence Capabilities Regarding Weapons of 
Mass Destruction, leading the North Korea 
and Iran policy steering committee. 
She went on to help establish the newly 
formed office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence as the Chief of Staff for policy and 
planning, where she managed the integration 
and collaboration of analysis and reporting 
with all intelligence agencies. 
During her time at the Department of State, 
Dr. Nesheiwat served as the first Deputy As-
sistant Secretary for Energy where she built a 
new bureau that addressed the nexus of en-
ergy, climate, technology, development, inter-
national programs, and public-private partner-
ships. She then collaborated with the Depart-
ment of Defense to create a new curriculum 
on energy security as a visiting professor at 
the Naval Post Graduate School. 
Dr. Nesheiwat continued her call to service 
as the first U.S. Deputy Presidential Envoy for 
Hostage Affairs focused on the release of U.S. 
citizens legally detained or held hostage 
abroad. Dr. Nesheiwat’s diplomatic work was 
instrumental in the release of dozens of Amer-
icans illegally held overseas as well as her 
work with the families of those detained. 
Returning to her home state of Florida, Dr. 
Nesheiwat was appointed by Governor Ron 
DeSantis to serve as Florida’s first Chief Resil-
ience Officer, a cabinet-level position tasked 
with preparing Florida for the environmental, 
physical, and economic impacts of sea level 
rise. 
In 2020, Dr. Nesheiwat once again an-
swered the call to serve, this time in the White 
House as Deputy Assistant to the President 
for Homeland Security and Resilience. At such 
a perilous time in our nation’s history, she 
brought her extensive expertise on national 
security and resilience to develop strategies to 
help protect America against the COVID pan-
demic, natural disasters, critical infrastructure 
protection, foreign election interference, civil 
unrest, counter-narcotics, and wildlife and traf-
ficking crimes. 
Dr. Nesheiwat was later appointed to serve 
a four-year term as a Commissioner on the 
U.S. Arctic Research Commission. The Com-
mission is an independent federal agency that 
advises the President and Congress on do-
mestic and international Arctic research. She 
is also a Distinguished Fellow with the Atlantic 
Council with the Global Energy Center. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the lifelong servant leader-
ship of Dr. Julia Nesheiwat and her career 
spanning the Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden 
Administrations. She has brought great credit 
to her country and we thank her as she con-
tinues to serve the American people.

RECOGNIZING JOE EDMONSON AND 
FAMILY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize and celebrate Mr. Joe 
Edmonson who has been named Mississippi’s 
Farmer of the Year by the Sunbelt Agriculture 
expo. I am proud to have him representing our 
state. 
Joe has been a motivated and passionate 
farmer for his entire life. At the age of fifteen, 
he purchased his first forty acres of land. Both 
Joe and his wife Melissa grew up in farming 
families and have dedicated their lives to 
Topshaw farms. Melissa is a full partner in the 
farms and is an essential figure in the 
Vardaman 
Sweet 
Potato 
Festival. 
Their 
daughter, Brandi also works in the business 
side of the farm. Her husband, Shaun man-
ages the packing warehouse line. Son Trent 
oversees planting and harvesting, and his wife 
is a nurse who aids in minor medical incidents 
around the farm. Son Cody manages sweet 
potato planting and grain harvesting and his 
wife Lindsey works in the packing warehouse 
offices and manages H2A work. 
The farm has endured multiple natural dis-
asters that affected their crop and livestock. 
The Edmonson family has taken these hard-
ships as opportunities to expand and built an 
impressive packing facility. They have taken 
into stride changes in agriculture technology 
and continue to evolve with the modern world. 
Joe and his family contribute to their sur-
rounding community through the Boy Scouts, 
Vardaman FFA, Calhoun County 4–H and the 
state Farm Bureau. 
Family is at the core of Mr. Edmonson’s fan-
ning career. Joe, Melissa, Brandi, Trent and 
Cody have been a pillar of the Vardaman 
community and have made incredible contribu-
tions to Calhoun County. I am grateful for their 
lifetime of service and commend him for his 
outstanding work in agriculture.

HONORING THE CAREER OF JOSIE 
BACALLAO 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
recognize the tremendous career and mean-
ingful work of Josie Bacallao, President & 
CEO of Hispanic Unity of Florida. 
Founded 39 years ago as a haven for immi-
grants and refugees, Hispanic Unity of Florida 
has grown to serve diverse and multi-cultural 
working families from the United States as 
well as more than 25 other countries. 
Under Ms. Bacallao’s leadership, the agen-
cy provides a range of wrap-around services 
to help more than 16,000 clients of all ages, 
from preschoolers to adults, successfully tran-
sition to a productive new life. 
Hispanic Unity of Florida acts as South Flor-
ida’s ‘‘Ellis Island’’ for new immigrants arriving 
in South Florida. Often arriving with little more 
than the clothes on their backs, a few dollars 
in pocket change, with no job, language, skills 
or understanding of the life that awaits them 
on America’s shores—they still come with 
hopes and dreams. 
And Josie works tirelessly to guarantee ev-
eryone is empowered to live their American 
Dream. 
Her commitment to strengthening the phys-
ical and financial health and wellness of Flor-
ida’s families is extensive, impressive, and in-
spiring. 
Josie Bacallao is a selfless, compassionate, 
and thoughtful citizen whose commitment to 
our community is exemplary, and I am proud 
to call her my dear friend. I wish her a hearty 
congratulations on her retirement and am 
grateful for her invaluable work to improve the 
lives of those in Florida’s 23rd Congressional 
District and beyond.

TRIBUTE TO OLYMPIC WRESTLER 
DAVID TAYLOR 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am proud 
to recognize David Taylor for his outstanding 
wrestling performance at the Tokyo Olympic 
Games. 
At the age of 8, David wrote down three 
goals: Win four high school state titles, win 
four college national championships, and win 
Olympic gold. Even at this young age, he had 
his mind set on objectives that would take 
countless hours of practice and dedication to 
accomplish. 
David wasted no time on his mission, 
amassing an impressive 180–2 high school 
record, including four state championships, 
and graduated with a 4.0 grade point average 
from my alma mater, Graham High School in 
St. Paris, Ohio. He would then go on to be-
come one of the most decorated wrestlers in 
Penn State University’s history: Four Big Ten 
championships, a four-time finalist and two- 
time NCAA National Champion, and twice the 
winner of the Dan Hodge Trophy, given to the 
undisputed best college wrestler in the nation. 
He then fixed his eyes on his final objective: 
Winning Olympic gold. With 17 seconds re-
maining in the gold medal match in Tokyo, 
Taylor scored a two-point takedown to give 
him his 52nd straight victory in international 
matches. David said afterward: ‘‘You’ve got to 
want it. You’ve got to want to be here.’’ 
David married the love of his life, Kendra, 
five years ago. Last month, on September 16, 
they welcomed baby Ivy into the world. Da-
vid’s parents, Dave and Kathy, currently reside 
in Chattanooga. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the people of 
Ohio’s Fourth Congressional District, I am 
honored to celebrate David’s accomplish-
ments, his dedication to the sport of wrestling, 
his integrity and work ethic, and his out-
standing contributions to the Olympic tradition. 
We wish him all the best in the future.

RECOGNIZING MISS KAYLYNN 
GONZALES 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Miss Kaylynn Gonzales for her 
beautification of Valley Animal Haven in 
Lemoore, California. 
Miss Gonzales is a Girl Scout Cadette from 
Hanford, California. This year, she led a team 
in beautifying Valley Animal Haven, a local pet 
adoption 
center. 
For 
this 
project, 
Miss 
Gonzales taught herself to paint and draw. To-
gether, her team created and painted wooden 
cartoon animals for the facility’s meet and 
greet pens. She also restored aging tables, 
chairs, and benches in the visitor’s areas and 
installed new bark mulch in the meet and 
greet area. Miss Gonzales raised money to 
fund this project by selling cookies and col-
lecting donations. 
Miss Gonzales selected this project because 
she is committed to raising awareness for re-
sponsible pet ownership and the importance of 
adopting from local shelters. In beautifying 
Valley Animal Haven, Miss Gonzales hopes to 
encourage more adoptions from the shelter. 
Her work is greatly appreciated by the Valley 
Animal Haven community and those who 
share her honorable mission. 
In recognition of her efforts, Miss Gonzales 
was awarded the Girl Scout Silver Award by 
the Girl Scouts of the USA, Central California 
South Council, Troop 3049. This is the highest 
honor a Girl Scout can receive at the Cadette 
level. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in con-
gratulating Miss Kaylynn Gonzales on this im-
portant achievement and recognizing her serv-
ice to her community.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF OFFICER ROBIN W. BLOSS 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I am privi-
leged and humbled to recognize Officer Robin 
W. Bloss upon the occasion of his retirement 
from the Penbrook Borough Police Force after 
more than thirty years of service. 
Officer Bloss began his journey as a 
Paxtang Borough Police Officer upon comple-
tion of Officer Training at the PA State Police 
Training Center in Hershey. Despite his recent 
introduction to the Force, he managed to re-
main employed full-time as a maintenance 
electrician with the Ames Companies Inc., 
while working 20-hour weeks with the Depart-
ment. 
Officer Bloss later transitioned to the 
Penbrook Borough Police Department, serving 
as a Bike Patrol Officer and the Borough Busi-
ness Contact for maintaining emergency notifi-
cation information. Throughout his many years 
with the Department, he received a litany of 
awards for his service, to include: Medal of 
Valor; Certificate of Merit; and multiple Life-
saving Awards. 
In the Fall of 2003, Officer Bloss received 
the Medal of Valor when he and Officer 
Swank saved an infant’s life during a violent 
domestic dispute on Boas Street. His Certifi-
cate of Merit was earned as he was on duty 
when shots were fired at Capitol Police. He 
earned his three Lifesaving Awards for CPR 
performed throughout his decades of service. 
Officer Bloss loved serving the community 
and was proud to wear the uniform, which he 
did with dignity and integrity. As proud as he 
was of his work in law enforcement, his three 
sons were his priority and focus of his greatest 
pride. He was blessed to serve simultaneously 
with two of his sons—one as Swatara Town-
ship K9 Police Officer, and one as a Dauphin 
County Dispatcher. 
Throughout his work as a patrol and bike 
patrol officer, he served with distinction, work-
ing the job and community events that fre-
quently took him away from his family and 
myriad holidays and special events. Despite 
his retirement, however, Officer Bloss will re-
main in service to citizens of the Borough of 
Paxtang as its EMA Coordinator. 
I commend Officer Robin Bloss upon the 
auspicious occasion of his hard-earned retire-
ment and lifelong commitment. For his tireless, 
selfless, and loyal service to our community, 
Commonwealth, and Nation, I wish him God-
speed on his next adventures.

RECOGNIZING PATRICK LAVIN ON 
HIS 
RETIREMENT

THE 
INTERNATIONAL 
BROTHERHOOD 
OF 
ELECTRICAL 
WORKERS 
(IBEW) LOCAL NO. 47 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, 
today I want to recognize Mr. Patrick Lavin, 
who has retired after serving seven terms as 
Business Manager and Financial Secretary of 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
(IBEW) Local No. 47 in Diamond Bar, Cali-
fornia. I thank Pat for his years of friendship 
and counsel and congratulate him on his re-
tirement following his 55-year career at IBEW, 
during which he was one of the most effective 
and longest-serving members of the IBEW 
International Executive Council (IEC), among 
many other roles. 
A journeyman lineman by trade, Pat joined 
IBEW Local 9 outside Chicago as a summer 
helper before his sophomore year in high 
school and came on the job full time in 1968. 
In 1969, Pat interrupted his IBEW career and 
volunteered to serve his country in the U.S. 
Marine Corps during the height of the Vietnam 
War. 
Over his lengthy career, Pat was a lineman 
for four different utilities. He worked for South-
ern California Edison (SCE) as a lineman, 
service crew foreman, and heavy crew fore-
man in Redondo Beach, Huntington Beach, 
and Santa Ana. 
Pat has said that he saw many different 
changes in the electrical industry over the 
course of his career, and that the need for the 
services of electrical workers has grown im-
mensely over the past twenty years. In his 
decades on the job, Pat also weathered nu-
merous challenges including recessions and 
periods of anti-union rhetoric. In his own 
words: ‘‘As a groundman, an apprentice and a 
lineman, I have helped keep the lights on 
since 1969.’’ 
In addition to seven terms as Business 
Manager and Financial Secretary of IBEW 
Local No. 47, Pat served five terms as the 
IBEW 7th District International Executive 
Council member. He was chosen as Secretary 
of the Council by the IEC in June 2003. Dur-
ing his many years in the field, Pat has 
worked for numerous IBEW signatory contrac-
tors and four utilities out of various local 
unions around the United States. When Pat 
took over Local 47 in 1999 it was a 4,500- 
member utility. Today, it serves 14,000 mem-
bers in nearly 200 classifications over a nearly 
80,000 square mile jurisdiction from the Pacific 
to Arizona and from Mexico to just south of 
Lake Tahoe. 
Pat was also chairman & treasurer of the 
Coalition 
of 
California 
Utility 
Employees 
(CCUE), a board member of California Unions 
for Reliable Energy (CURE), an executive 
board member of the Califomia State Associa-
tion of Electrical Workers (CSAEW), and a 
member of the board of directors of California

Council on International Policy and served as 
chair of the IBEW No. 47 Retiree Medical 
Trust Fund, along with being a trustee of the 
Cal-Nevada IBEW/NECA JATC Board. 
As a member of the IBEW International Ex-
ecutive Council, Pat was a trustee on the 
IBEW Pension Benefit Fund and all funds of 
the International Brotherhood of Electrical 
Workers. In addition to those duties, he served 
on the National Employee Benefit Board 
(NEBB), which is the board of directors for the 
National Electric Benefit Fund (NEFB), Na-
tional Electric Annuity Plan (NEAP), and the 
National Electric 401 K (NEFP). In June 2017, 
Pat was nominated California Veteran of the 
Year by the California State Assembly. 
Pat holds a Bachelor’s Degree in Organiza-
tional Management from Southern California 
College. He was married to his wife, Ellen, for 
45 years prior to her passing in 2019 and re-
cently married his current wife, Dianne. Pat 
has two daughters, two sons, and eleven 
grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing and thanking Mr. Patrick 
Lavin for his many years of outstanding serv-
ice to electrical workers in Southern California 
and nationwide and for his exemplary leader-
ship ‘‘keeping the lights on.’’

HONORING JENNIFER REDMOND 
AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Jennifer Redmond, the state executive 
director of Nebraska and Iowa for Susan G. 
Komen. Their mission is to save lives by 
meeting the most critical needs of their com-
munities and investing in breakthrough re-
search to prevent and cure breast cancer. 
Susan G. Komen has invested in more than 
$1.1 billion collectively in lifesaving breast can-
cer research since 1982. More than 1,200 
Iowans seek help and information from Susan. 
G. Komen every week, and all 99 counties in 
Iowa are served by Susan G. Komen breast 
cancer services. 
All Iowans can get involved with Susan G. 
Komen through events and activities orga-
nized throughout the state, by becoming an in-
dividual advocate or by registering their work-
place for volunteer programs, fundraising cam-
paigns, and access to world-class breast can-
cer content. There are currently 1,786 people 
in Iowa who advocate for breast cancer rights 
with Susan G. Komen. 
Jennifer and the team at Susan G. Komen 
also ensure everyone has access to quality 
screening, diagnosis, and treatment for breast 
cancer. Anyone who reaches out, no matter 
where they are in their breast cancer journey 
is welcome at Susan G. Komen. 
Jennifer and her staff spend every day sup-
porting organizations that provide vital serv-
ices and research to Iowans and it is my 
pleasure to honor Jennifer Redmond as Iowan 
of the Week. 
RECOGNIZING THE REDEDICATION 
OF THE TOWN OF TONAWANDA 
POLICE HEADQUARTERS AS THE 
‘‘FRANK 
H. 
PFONNER 
PUBLIC 
SAFETY BUILDING’’ 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise to recognize the rededication of 
the Town of Tonawanda Police Headquarters 
as the ‘‘Frank H. Pfonner Public Safety Build-
ing,’’ in honor of Police Officer Frank H. 
Pfonner. Officer Pfonner, the only Town of 
Tonawanda Police Officer to have been killed 
in the line of duty. 
Frank was born in June of 1893 to George 
and Elisabeth Pfonner. He was raised on the 
Pfonner family farm, located where Military 
Road meets Knoche Road today. The path 
that once connected the house to the barns 
has become Ensminger Road in Tonawanda 
Frank was one of the first officers hired by 
the Town of Tonawanda Police Department. 
He became Constable for the Town, and dur-
ing his years of service risked his life to pro-
tect those in Tonawanda on many occasions. 
In one instance, he incurred a gunshot wound 
to the head, but later returned to duty. 
Frank would be killed in a hit-and-run inci-
dent while on his motorcycle, ending his watch 
over the Town of Tonawanda on April 8, 1923. 
Frank had no children, but his commitment 
to service lived on through his family. His 
brother, Elmer G. Pfonner, would serve in the 
First World War. Upon his return, Elmer 
served as a Constable much like Frank. How-
ever, Elmer resigned when his parents be-
came distraught at the thought of losing an-
other son. 
Elmer went on to have five children, who 
would have been Frank’s nieces and neph-
ews. Two of Frank’s nephew served in the Ko-
rean War, and the youngest of the nephews 
would go on to have four children. As a sym-
bol of the legacy of Officer Pfonner, the 
youngest of the children was named Frank H. 
Pfonner, after his great uncle. 
Town of Tonawanda Supervisor Joseph 
Emminger, the Town Board, and Police Chief 
James Stauffiger are to be commended for re-
membering the life and legacy of Officer 
Pfonner through rededication of the Town of 
Tonawanda Police Headquarters in his honor. 
This tribute will serve as a lasting reminder 
of the great sacrifices made by Officer Frank 
H. Pfonner and all police past and present 
who risk their own lives to serve our commu-
nities.

HONORING THE INSTALLATION OF 
LAMONT REPOLLET AS PRESI-
DENT OF KEAN UNIVERSITY 
HON. ALBIO SIRES 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, today, I recog-
nize and congratulate Lamont Repollet’s in-
stallation as the 18th leader of Kean Univer-
sity. He has been a dear friend for many 
years, and I believe he is an excellent choice 
to take on the role of President of Kean Uni-
versity. 
Lamont Repollet has demonstrated a life-
long commitment to educating students in 
New Jersey. He started as a teacher and 
coach in an urban area, an experience we 
share and one that has informed his entire ca-
reer. As a principal and then superintendent, 
he implemented many initiatives including 
those focused on closing the opportunity gap, 
increasing graduation rates, and creating new 
leadership and literacy programs. 
He brought his dedication to equity and op-
portunity to the state level as Commissioner of 
Education and applied everything he learned 
in his prior roles toward improving our edu-
cation system. He did this while tackling the 
immense challenge of restructuring student 
learning during the COVID–19 pandemic. La-
mont Repollet has broken barriers as the first 
Black principal of Carteret High School, the 
first Black Commissioner of Education of the 
State of New Jersey, and now, the first Black 
president of Kean University, where he has 
deep ties. As an alumnus and former member 
of the Board of Trustees, he has knowledge 
of, and a commitment to, the students, faculty, 
and community. 
Madam Speaker, I know that he will work 
hard to create new opportunities for students 
while creating an environment in which every-
one can flourish. It is my great honor to recog-
nize this milestone for Lamont Repollet and 
Kean University and I know that there are 
great things ahead.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2119, THE 
FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION 
AND 
SERVICES 
IMPROVEMENT 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, today, I voted 
in favor of H.R. 2119, the Family Violence 
Prevention and Services Improvement Act. It 
is important for our Nation to address the 
scourge of domestic violence, which affects far 
too many residents of our country, and I am 
disappointed that the legislation before the 
House today could not be written, and ulti-
mately passed, on a bipartisan basis. Domes-
tic violence transcend politics and does not 
discriminate based on political preference. 
There are provisions in this legislation that 
are important to constituencies I represent. My 
home state of Oklahoma is home to some of 
the largest Tribal populations. I am pleased 
that H.R. 2119 provides increased resources 
to Tribal nations to fully respond to domestic 
violence in their communities. Specifically, 
H.R. 2119 increases the tribal set-aside for 
grant funding from 10 percent to 12.5 percent. 
This increased set-aside will improve technical 
assistance to Tribes, development of domestic 
violence prevention strategies, and implemen-
tation of community responses to reduce risk 
factors for family violence. Moreover, the im-
plementation of a new emergency hotline 
dedicated to serving Indians affected by do-
mestic violence will significantly benefit the 
Native American population. 
Yet I also recognize that the bill voted on 
today has some very real problems. I have

concerns with several key provisions, which is 
why it is my hope that if the Senate passes its 
own version of this legislation, these troubled

the right to vote no on any vote on final pas-

RECOMMENDING THAT THE HOUSE 
FIND STEPHEN K. BANNON IN 
CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DAVID N. CICILLINE 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, October 21, 2021 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of holding Steve Bannon in 
contempt of Congress for refusing to answer a 
Congressional subpoena and in support of 
truth, transparency, and the rule of law. 
January 6 was one of the most heinous at-
tacks on American democracy that our country 
has ever seen. We have mountains of evi-
dence that these rioters, encouraged by and 
organized by some of our country’s highest of-
ficials, intended to overthrow our democracy at 
the behest of Donald Trump. 
We must get to the bottom of what hap-
pened, not only to hold these insurrectionists 
accountable, but to prevent something like this 
from ever happening again. 
Steve Bannon clearly had inside knowledge 
of what was going to happen that day. He 
even said on January 5 that ‘‘all hell was 
going to break loose’’ on January 6. He has 
information that must be shared. 
The January 6 commission is a bipartisan 
effort to get the truth. 
This goes beyond party politics—this is 
about the safety and security of our democ-
racy. 
I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting 
to hold Steve Bannon in contempt for his re-
fusal to comply with the Committee’s sub-
poena. Vote for yes.

REMEMBERING MIMI LEVIN 
LIEBER 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of my good friend Mimi 
Levin Lieber, a beloved public servant and 
leader in early childhood education. 
Mimi devoted her life to her mission of mak-
ing literacy a right of all children, a passion 
that led her to launch Literacy Inc. (LINC), an 
organization in my district dedicated to pro-
viding children with a strong foundation of lit-
eracy early in life. Through her organization, 
Mimi was able to touch the lives of so many 
New Yorkers by taking an innovative commu-
nity-based approach to learning that ad-
dressed the systemic inequalities in our edu-
cation system. 
Mimi believed that through reading, every-
thing 
becomes 
possible. 
This 
conviction 
served her well while attending the University 
of Chicago for her Bachelor’s and Master of 
Arts Degrees and, later, training in London to 
become a pioneer in qualitative research. After 
completing a fellowship at Harvard’s Graduate 
School for Education, she met her husband for 
life, Charles Lieber. Charles was a well-trav-
eled, multi-lingual native of the Netherlands 
who fled the Nazi occupation of Belgium in 
1940. Forty years later, he would go on to ac-
quire the Hebrew Publishing Company, the 
oldest American publisher of Judaica. 
After moving to New York in 1960, she and 
Charles raised four children on the Upper 
West Side. Mimi cherished being a mother 
and believed raising children was one of the 
most important, yet undervalued, roles in life. 
Mimi grew up in a cohesive Jewish community 
in Detroit, but she quickly became a true New 
Yorker who looked out for everyone in her 
community. She served on the synagogue 
board, Hebrew school board, the Jewish 
Board of Guardians, and Community Planning 
Board 7. While doing all this, Mimi, a trained 
sociologist, also founded Lieber Attitude Re-
search which became one of the first firms to 
employ focus groups to help companies un-
derstand client thinking. 
This public service and her sociology back-
ground led me to nominate her to the New 
York State Board of Regents, where she 
served New York students for 15 years. While 
on the board, she successfully lobbied politi-
cians around the state to make critical invest-
ments necessary to tum young children in the 
five boroughs into learners for life. During her 
service, she became a breast cancer survivor 
and spoke openly about her illness when 
many would not. Mimi never viewed public 
service as a sacrifice; she believed in the 
power of community and viewed the ability to 
serve others as a privilege. One of her sons, 
Janno Lieber, continued her tradition of public 
service and currently serves as Acting Chair 
and CEO of New York’s MTA. In her later 
years, she spent much of her time at her fam-
ily’s countryside retreat in Spencertown, New 
York and continued to serve on the board of 
LINC. 
Her legacy reminds us that we must support 
and invest in our children’s education from the 
earliest years, when it matters the most, and 
that universal literacy is critical to sustaining a 
healthy democracy. Mimi will truly be missed, 
and she has left her imprint on the thousands 
of readers she inspired through her advocacy. 
Mimi is survived by her children, grand-
children, and members of her LINC family. 
May her memory be a blessing.

NATIONAL SPINA BIFIDA 
AWARENESS MONTH 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize October as National 
Spina Bifida Awareness Month, and to pay 
tribute to the numerous individuals and their 
families across our country living with this con-
dition. 
Spina Bifida is the nation’s most common, 
permanently disabling, birth defect compatible 
with life. According to the March of Dimes, 
about 1,645 babies are born with this condi-
tion in the United States each year, with its 
prevalence being highest in the Hispanic pop-
ulation. Known as a neural tube defect, Spina 
Bifida stems from a hole in the spinal cord that 
occurs when the spinal column fails to close 
properly during development in the womb. As 
a result, this condition impacts virtually every 
major organ system in the body. Children born 
with Spina Bifida typically undergo dozens of 
surgeries before they become adults. Adults 
living with Spina Bifida face a myriad of phys-
ical and mental health conditions, as well as 
other challenges, such as unemployment and 
limited access to quality primary and specialty 
care. 
Over the last three decades we have made 
significant strides in preventing this birth de-
fect and managing the care of those born with 
this condition. In response to research show-
ing the incidence of Spina Bifida could be re-
duced by up to 70 percent with the addition of 
folic acid in a woman’s diet, the United States 
Public Health Service recommended that all 
women of childbearing years should take 400 
micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent hav-
ing a pregnancy affected by a neural tube de-
fect. Based on this recommendation, I intro-
duced the Folic Acid Promotion and Birth De-
fects Prevention Act, which was passed into 
law as part of the Children’s Health Act of 
2000. This Act authorized a program within 
CDC to provide professional and public edu-
cation for folic acid awareness. 
In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-
tration required that folic acid be added to en-
riched grain products such as bread, pasta, 
rice, and cereal to increase the likelihood that 
women would have sufficient folic acid in their 
diet before becoming pregnant. And in 2016, 
after years of advocacy with the FDA and the 
corn masa industry, folic acid fortification of 
corn masa flour was finally begun to target 
Hispanic communities that consume more 
corn masa products than grains. But there is 
still much work to be done to ensure adequate 
consumption of this critical nutrient that can 
neural tube defects. 
There are currently an estimated 166,000 
individuals in the United States living with 
Spina Bifida, approximately 65 of whom are 
adults. This disease is now witnessing its first 
generation of adults, an incredible milestone, 
considering that the original designation of 
Spina Bifida as a childhood condition meant 
most children born with this condition did not 
experience life beyond youth. Today, a gen-
eration of adults living with Spina Bifida, some 
of whom are 65 years and older, is an 
achievement worth celebrating. But unfortu-
nately, there remain many unmet needs and 
additional health challenges affecting this 
medically fragile population. 
As individuals develop, their clinical needs 
change, as should the type of care, and often 
the type of medical professional they see for 
that care. One challenge is that while we have 
a coordinated system of care designed to treat 
children with Spina Bifida in the United States, 
there is no equivalent for adults. Thus, the 
‘‘graduating child’’ enters a very fractured 
medical system where individuals struggle to 
find physicians willing to provide treatment. 
Unfortunately, many of these physicians lack 
basic knowledge of this complex condition, 
and thousands of young to middle-aged adults 
are left with few options other than to seek 
care in the emergency room—or continue to 
see their pediatric care team at Spina Bifida 
Centers, which are designed for children.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1150 
October 26, 2021 
In recent years, the Spina Bifida community 
has seen a growing incidence of sudden death 
in its over 25 population. There is speculation 
this sudden loss of life has something to do 
with the central nervous system, but the cause 
or causes remain unknown. As such, we must 
explore and understand this sudden death 
phenomenon so we can reverse this troubling 
trend. Moreover, we must support—and ex-
pand investment in—research to address 
other issues related to Spina Bifida and asso-
ciated secondary and co-morbid conditions, 
such as hydrocephalus, latex allergy, neuro-
genic bladder and bowel problems, develop-
mental delay, and impaired executive func-
tioning. 
The CDC’s National Spina Bifida Program is 
the sole federal program tasked with improv-
ing the care and outcomes for people with 
Spina Bifida. In 2008, the Spina Bifida Pro-
gram created a National Spina Bifida Patient 
Registry (NSBPR) to collect the scientific data 
needed to evaluate existing medical services 
for Spina Bifida patients, and to provide clini-
cians, researchers, patients, and families a 
‘‘window’’ into what care models are effective 
and what treatments are not making a meas-
urable difference. Building on this in 2014, the 
Spina Bifida Program funded the development 
of a Spina Bifida Collaborative Care Network 
(SBCCN) to identify and disseminate ‘‘best 
practices’’ for the care of people with Spina 
Bifida at all ages. These programs continue to 
improve quality-of-life and outcomes for peo-
ple with this birth defect, but their full potential 
has been constrained due to flat federal fund-
ing over the last six years. Additional funding 
could expand the number of clinics partici-
pating in the registry and increase the amount 
of information reported, which will provide fur-
ther insights into how to continue improving 
care and outcomes for people with Spina 
Bifida. 
People with Spina Bifida deserve no less 
than the rest of us as we age. During a life-
time, someone with Spina Bifida will face at 
least a $1,000,000 in medical expenses, in-
cluding multiple surgeries, and most can ex-
pect to spend much of their lives in a wheel-
chair or walking with braces. We must ensure 
that adults with Spina Bifida can receive evi-
dence-based medical care tailored for their 
condition and receive that care in age-appro-
priate, non-emergency settings. I call upon my 
Congressional colleagues to prioritize in-
creased funding for the CDC Spina Bifida Pro-
gram to ensure that it will be poised to best 
guide the health care community in optimal 
treatment options for people living with Spina 
Bifida.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
MEMORY 
OF 
MR. 
PAUL 
WRABEC 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, October 26, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart to celebrate the life 
and legacy of a dear friend, an ambitious lead-
er, and a dedicated public servant: Paul 
Wrabec. Paul, who passed away on October 
20th, never faltered from advocating for the 
causes he was deeply passionate about, and 
his advocacy undoubtedly made Jackson 
County a better place to call home. As a be-
loved and active member of the Greater Kan-
sas City community, he created change and 
inspired future generations of policy makers to 
lead with a sense of conviction. Paul will be 
missed dearly, and his life is well worth re-
membering. 
A lifelong resident of Sugar Creek, Missouri, 
Paul comes from a proud Croatian and Slavic 
family that immigrated to the United States in 
the early 1900s. Growing up in this thriving im-
migrant community, Paul was taught the val-
ues of equality, union rights, and environ-
mental stewardship. Throughout his life, Paul 
remained committed to those values as he led 
a fulfilling career as a civil servant. 
A graduate of St. Mary High School and 
Rockhurst University, Wrabec retired from en-
vironmental remediation work in 2005. Oper-
ating the Kansas City, Sugar Creek, and Inde-
pendence License offices with his son, Cyril, 
Paul ensured that disabled and elderly mem-
bers of the community had access to much 
needed services. But his impact as an empa-
thetic community member didn’t stop there. 
Paul also served on the Sugar Creek Board 
of Aldermen, and then was first elected to the 
Jackson County Democratic Party committee 
in 1978 and was its longest-serving chair-
person in nearly 100 years. He was known 
throughout Jackson County for being able to 
‘‘run circles’’ around others in fundraising and 
for constantly raising the bar for successful 
local campaigns. Always emphasizing the im-
portance of voting, Paul worked tirelessly to 
rally communities throughout Independence 
and Sugar Creek ahead of critical elections. 
While Paul certainly wore his political beliefs 
on his sleeve as a loyal Democrat, he was a 
steadfast believer in building relationships with 
those across the aisle. Indeed, he found ways 
to make peace with people from all walks of 
life, and his gentle demeanor and contagious 
smile always made him a joy to be around. 
There is no doubt that he established a con-
nection with every individual he came across. 
Looking beyond his extraordinary work as a 
public official, Paul was a heartfelt family man 
who enjoyed hunting and fishing at the Lake 
of the Ozarks with his family. Making time for 
his loved ones was always his first priority. 
Paul’s storytelling of family history and gen-
erous nature will be missed, but all those who 
have met him will still have felt his impact for 
the rest of their lives. 
Many still remember times when Paul 
picked up hitchhikers, gave money to the 
homeless, and happily lent a helping hand to 
anyone needing anything. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in remem-
bering the inspiring, impactful life of Paul 
Wrabec. Please also join me in offering con-
dolences to his family and all those mourning 
his loss. Let us seek to emulate his example 
in the work we do here by preserving Paul’s 
story of public service and human empathy.
