PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our judge, nothing is hidden 
from Your sight. Thus, we stand before 
You to give account for our role in to-
day’s momentous decisions. In our 
deepest desire to carry out our respon-
sibilities to govern, protect, and pre-
serve this Nation, while yet unsettled 
by the events of this past week, we find 
ourselves seizing the scales of justice 
from the jaws of mobocracy. 
Almighty God, wield Your sword and 
penetrate the confusion and discontent 
of our country. Lay bare our attitudes 
of vengeance that You would show us 
how to serve as instruments of Your 
pure judgment and peace. Divide our 
rhetoric from the light of Your truth. 
Judge our partisan thoughts and con-
vict us to attend to the common good. 
We have taken our obligations freely, 
but we remain beholden to Your guid-
ance. Hold us, then, accountable to 
Your powerful Word. 
In the strength of Your holy name, 
we pray. 
Amen.

shall be privileged during the remainder of 
the One Hundred Seventeenth Congress. 
SEC. 4. Section 5 of House Resolution 8, 
agreed to January 4, 2021, is amended by 
striking ‘‘January 28’’ each place that it ap-
pears and inserting ‘‘February 11’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the distin-
guished 
gentleman 
from 
Oklahoma 
(Mr. COLE), pending which I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. Dur-
ing consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
be given 5 legislative days to revise and 
extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday, the Rules Committee met and 
reported a closed rule, House Resolu-
tion 41, providing for consideration of 
H. Res. 24, impeaching Donald John 
Trump, President of the United States, 
for high crimes and misdemeanors. 
The rule provides 2 hours of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. The rule also 
provides that upon adoption of H. Res. 
24, H. Res. 40 is hereby adopted. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same-day authority through February 
11, 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, we are debating this 
historic measure at an actual crime 
scene, and we wouldn’t be here if it 
weren’t for the President of the United 
States. 
On Wednesday, January 6, Congress 
gathered here to fulfill our constitu-
tional duty, tallying the electoral col-
lege victory of President-elect Biden 
and Vice-President-elect HARRIS after a 
free and fair election. 
This is largely a ceremonial role for 
the Congress, one that sends the mes-
sage to the world that democracy in 
the United States persists. But at a 
rally just a mile and a half down Penn-
sylvania Avenue, Donald Trump and 
his allies were stoking the anger of a 
violent mob. 
A Member of this very body pro-
claimed on that stage: ‘‘Today is the 
day American patriots start taking 
down names and kicking ass.’’ 
Trump’s personal attorney, Rudy 
Giuliani, called for a ‘‘trial by com-
bat.’’ 
Then Donald Trump told the crowd: 
‘‘We are going to have to fight much 
harder . . . you will never take back 
our country with weakness.’’ 
Even though, according to his own 
administration that this election was 
the most secure in our history, Donald 
Trump repeated his big lie that this 
election was an egregious assault on 
democracy. 
He said Vice President PENCE ‘‘was 
going to have to come through for us.’’ 
Trump then told this mob to ‘‘walk 
down to the Capitol.’’ 
The signal was unmistakable: These 
thugs should stage a coup so Donald 
Trump can hang on to power. The peo-
ple’s will be damned. 
This beacon of democracy became 
the site of a vicious attack. Rioters 
chanted, ‘‘Hang Mike Pence,’’ as noose 
and gallows were built a stone’s throw 
from the Capitol steps. Capitol police 
officers were beaten and sprayed with 
pepper spray. Attackers hunted down 
lawmakers to hold them hostage or 
worse. Staff barricaded doors. People 
sent text messages to their families to 
tell them they loved them. They 
thought they were saying good-bye, 
Mr. Speaker. 
This was not a protest. This was an 
insurrection. This was a well-organized 
attack on our country that was incited 
by Donald Trump. 
Domestic terrorists broke into the 
United States Capitol that day and it 
is a miracle more people didn’t die. As 
my colleagues and I were being evacu-
ated to safety, I never ever will forget 
what I saw when I looked into the eyes 
of those attackers right in the Speak-
er’s lobby there. I saw evil, Mr. Speak-
er. Our country came under attack not 
from a foreign nation, but from within. 
These were not protesters. These 
were not patriots. These were traitors. 
These were domestic terrorists, Mr. 
Speaker, and they were acting under 
the orders of Donald Trump. 
Some of my colleagues on the other 
side have suggested that we just move 
on from this horror. But to gloss over 
it would be an abdication of our duty. 
Others on the Republican side have 
talked about unity. But we can’t have 
unity without truth and without ac-
countability. And I am not about to be 
lectured by people who just voted to 
overturn the results of a free and fair 
election. 
America was attacked and we must 
respond, even when the cause of this vi-
olence resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Av-
enue. 
Each of us took an oath last week. It 
wasn’t to a party and it wasn’t to a 
person. We vowed to defend the Con-
stitution. The actions of Donald Trump 
have called each of us to fulfill that 
oath today. I pray that we rise to this 
responsibility because every moment 
Donald Trump is in the White House, 
our Nation and our freedom is in dan-
ger. He must be held to account for the 
attack on our Capitol that he orga-
nized and he incited. 
I solemnly urge my colleagues to 
support this rule and the underlying 
article. The damage this building sus-
tained can be repaired, Mr. Speaker; 
but if we don’t hold Donald Trump ac-
countable, the damage done to our Na-
tion could be irreversible. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, before I begin my for-
mal remarks, I want to ask for God’s 
blessing and protection on you; on my 
friend, Mr. MCGOVERN; for all who 
come to this Chamber today to speak 
and to vote; for our wonderful staff 
that make this possible; and most espe-
cially for the men and women of the 
Capitol Police and the other affiliated 
law enforcement agencies that are here 
to protect everybody and to make sure 
that this proceeding can go forward. 
With that, Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, my very good friend, the distin-
guished chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee, Mr. MCGOVERN, for yielding me 
the customary 30 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day for 
all of us, for me personally, for the 
Rules Committee, for the entire House 
of Representatives, and most certainly 
for the American people. 
For the second time in 13 months, we 
are meeting to discuss the impeach-
ment of the President of the United 
States. Our meeting today does not 
arise in a vacuum and comes at what I 
hope and pray is the end of a tumul-
tuous period for our country. 
Less than 1 week ago, Congress met 
to certify the results of the 2020 Presi-
dential election. What started out as 
peaceful protests, turned into a riot as 
an 
untold 
number 
of 
individuals 
stormed the Capitol Building. Six peo-
ple died as a result of this mob. It is 
only by the grace of God and the brave 
acts of the U.S. Capitol Police; the 
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police; 
the FBI; the ATF; and other respond-
ing agencies that there was not more 
bloodshed. 
Violent acts such as these have no 
place in our Republic. These shocking 
and sobering events rest high on our 
minds today, as well they should. Cer-
tainly, January 6, 2021, will live in my 
memory as the darkest day during my 
time in service as a Member of this 
House. 
After these grave events, we, as a na-
tion and as an institution, have an op-
portunity to come together. President 
Trump has conceded the 2020 election. 
Congress has certified the results of 
the election, and next Wednesday, 
President-elect Biden will be sworn in 
as the President of the United States. 
Congress and the Nation can move 
forward knowing that the political 
process was completed as designed and 
that the constitutional framework that 
has governed our Republic since 1789 
held firm. But instead of moving for-
ward as a unifying force, majority in 
the House is choosing to divide us fur-
ther. 
With only 1 week to go in his term, 
the majority is asking us to consider a 
resolution 
impeaching 
President 
Trump, and they do so knowing full 
well that even if the House passes this 
resolution, the Senate will not be able 
to begin considering these charges 
until after President Trump’s term 
ends.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H153 
January 13, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I can think of no action 
the House can take that is more likely 
to further divide the American people 
than the action we are contemplating 
today. Emotions are clearly running 
high and political divisions have never 
been more apparent in my lifetime. 
We desperately need to seek a path 
forward, healing for the American peo-
ple. So it is unfortunate that a path to 
support healing is not the path the ma-
jority has chosen today. Instead, the 
House is moving forward erratically 
with a truncated process that does not 
comport with the modern practice and 
that will give Members no time to con-
template the serious course of action 
before us. 
In every modern impeachment in-
quiry, an investigation and committee 
action has preceded bringing an im-
peachment resolution to the floor. In 
part, this is to ensure that members 
have the full facts, the opportunity to 
engage expert witnesses, and have a 
chance to be heard. It also provides due 
process to the President of the United 
States. Again, in every modern im-
peachment inquiry, the President has 
been given an opportunity to be heard 
in some form or another. 
This is necessary in order to ensure 
that the American people have con-
fidence in the procedures the House is 
following. It is also necessary, not be-
cause of the President’s inappropriate 
and reckless words are deserving of de-
fense, but because the Presidency itself 
demands due process in the impeach-
ment proceedings. 
Unfortunately, the majority has cho-
sen to race to the floor with a new Ar-
ticle of Impeachment, forgoing any in-
vestigation, any committee process or 
any chance for Members to fully con-
template this course of action before 
proceeding. 
Professor Jonathan Turley is correct 
when he called this ‘‘a dangerous snap 
impeachment—an impeachment that 
effectively would go to a vote without 
the deliberation or inquiries of a tradi-
tional hearing.’’ 
Professor Turley also noted that ‘‘the 
damage caused by the rioters this week 
was enormous. However, it will pale in 
comparison to the damage from a new 
precedent of a snap impeachment. . . .’’ 
Mr. Speaker, if the majority is seek-
ing consensus, this is hardly the way to 
create it. 
b 0930 
The majority is failing to provide the 
House with an opportunity to review 
all the facts—which are still coming to 
light—to discuss all the evidence, to 
listen to scholars, to examine the wit-
nesses, and to consider precedence. 
This is not the type of robust process 
we have followed for every modern im-
peachment, and the failure to do so 
does a great disservice to this institu-
tion and to this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I could think of nothing 
that will cause further division more 
than the path the majority is now tak-
ing. Rather than looking ahead to a 
new administration, the majority is 
again seeking to settle scores against 
the old one. Rather than seeking to 
heal America, they are seeking to di-
vide us more deeply, and rather than 
following the appropriate processes the 
House has used in every modern im-
peachment, the majority is rushing to 
the floor, tripping all over themselves 
in their rush to impeach the President 
a second time. 
What is worse, though, is the major-
ity seems to believe this course of ac-
tion is self-evident, and that is simply 
not the case. I have to tell them: it is 
not. Members have reviewed the same 
conduct and have come to dramatically 
different conclusions. Legal scholars 
like Professor Turley and Professor 
Alan Dershowitz, both of whom con-
demn the President’s statements, be-
lieve that his statements are not im-
peachable. I know other scholars have 
different points of view. 
Given this difference of opinion, 
shouldn’t we have a better process than 
this? 
Shouldn’t we have a chance to exam-
ine witnesses, discuss the matter with 
legal scholars, and consider this in 
committee? 
On a matter as grave and consequen-
tial as impeachment, shouldn’t we fol-
low the same process we have used in 
every 
modern 
impeachment 
rather 
than rushing to the floor? 
On behalf of generations of Ameri-
cans to come, we need to think more 
clearly about the consequences of our 
actions today. The fact of the matter 
is, Mr. Speaker, there is no reason to 
rush forward like this, other than the 
very obvious fact that there are only 7 
days left until the new President takes 
office. But what is worse, as Professor 
Dershowitz has pointed out, because of 
the Senate’s rules, the case cannot 
come to trial in the Senate until 1 p.m. 
on January 20, 1 hour after President 
Trump leaves office. 
This is an ill-advised course, in my 
opinion, Mr. Speaker. Even Senator 
JOE MANCHIN, a Democrat, agrees. Sen-
ator MANCHIN is quoted this week as 
having said, ‘‘I think this is so ill-ad-
vised for Joe Biden to be coming in, 
trying to heal the country, trying to be 
the President of all the people when we 
are going to be so divided and fighting 
again. Let the judicial system do its 
job.’’ 
So what, then, is the point of the 
rush to impeach? 
We are coming off a horrific event 
that resulted in six deaths. We have an 
opportunity to move forward, but we 
cannot if the majority insists on bring-
ing the country through the trauma of 
another impeachment. It will carry for-
ward into the next President’s term en-
suring that he will struggle to organize 
his administration. What is worse, it 
will continue to generate the bitter-
ness so many of us have opposed. 
Why put us through that when we 
can’t actually resolve this before the 
end of the President’s term? 
Mr. Speaker, I think my colleagues 
in the majority need to think about 
this more soberly. We need to recognize 
we are following a flawed process. We 
need to recognize that people of good-
will can differ. We need to recognize 
that, while the House may be done 
with this matter after today’s vote, it 
will not be done for the country. It will 
not be done for the Senate, and it will 
not be done for the incoming Biden ad-
ministration. The House’s action today 
will only extend the division longer 
than necessary. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would note 
that there are other remedies that can 
be pursued. The President is expected 
to face litigation over his role in last 
Wednesday’s events. There will be 
criminal proceedings against the per-
petrators, and I hope all of those who 
stormed the Capitol will be brought to 
justice. And some Members have pro-
posed an alternative procedure—cen-
suring the President—which could gar-
ner significant bipartisan support in 
the House. 
I do not think impeachment is a wise 
course, Mr. Speaker. I would urge my 
friends in the majority to reconsider. 
There is still time to choose a different 
path, one that leads to reconciliation 
and hope for better and brighter days. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the 
rule, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the powerful statement by Congress-
woman LIZ CHENEY, who is the chair of 
the House Republican Conference, ti-
tled ‘‘I will vote to impeach the Presi-
dent.’’ 
CHENEY: I WILL VOTE TO IMPEACH THE 
PRESIDENT 
January 12, 2021. 
WASHINGTON—Wyoming 
Congresswoman 
and House Republican Conference Chair Liz 
Cheney (R–WY) released the following state-
ment ahead of votes in the House this week: 
‘‘On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked 
the United States Capitol to obstruct the 
process of our democracy and stop the count-
ing of presidential electoral votes. This in-
surrection caused injury, death and destruc-
tion in the most sacred space in our Repub-
lic. 
‘‘Much more will become clear in coming 
days and weeks, but what we know now is 
enough. The President of the United States 
summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and 
lit the flame of this attack. Everything that 
followed was his doing. None of this would 
have happened without the President. The 
President could have immediately and force-
fully intervened to stop the violence. He did 
not. There has never been a greater betrayal 
by a President of the United States of his of-
fice and his oath to the Constitution. 
‘‘I will vote to impeach the President.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to be clear about just one thing: If we 
vote to impeach the President today 
and we send it over to the Senate, 
there is nothing to prevent the Senate 
from taking it up immediately if Sen-
ate Majority Leader MITCH MCCONNELL 
decides that he wants to proceed, num-
ber one. 
Number two, we all want to talk 
about unity. I can’t think of anything

that would unify this country more 
than if there was a big bipartisan vote 
in favor of impeachment. Every second 
that this President remains in office is 
a danger to this country and to the 
world. We have no idea what he is capa-
ble of doing, whether he will pardon 
these terrorists or whether he will go 
to war. 
So I urge all my colleagues on both 
sides to support this rule and the im-
peachment resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, last week, I 
hid in an office for hours, terrified to 
open the door because I did not know if 
a rioter was on the other side ready to 
attack, kidnap, or murder me. But my 
experiences were just the tip of the ice-
berg. The U.S. Capitol was targeted, 
besieged, and ransacked on January 6 
by a murderous mob holding a noose 
for Vice President PENCE and targeting 
Speaker PELOSI. Their rampage re-
sulted in destruction and five people 
dead. 
We were attacked by terrorists, but 
this 
time 
the 
terrorists 
were 
radicalized right here in the United 
States. Worse, they were radicalized by 
the President, who intentionally lied 
to his supporters that the election was 
stolen and then told them when to 
come to D.C., where to protest, and 
whom to direct their anger at. 
The need to remove this President 
could not be more urgent. He is too 
dangerous to remain in office. Donald 
Trump must be held accountable. He 
must be impeached. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to immediately bring 
up a resolution establishing a bipar-
tisan national commission on the do-
mestic terrorist attack on the United 
States Capitol. This proposed bipar-
tisan commission will be tasked with 
examining and reporting upon the ter-
ror attack upon our Capitol that oc-
curred last Wednesday. The commis-
sion will be bipartisan in nature, mod-
eled after the 9/11 Commission, and will 
fully be empowered to undertake a full 
investigation and make recommenda-
tions to the President and to Congress. 
I can think of no more appropriate 
path for Congress to follow than by en-
suring a bipartisan commission reviews 
all evidence and reports back to us on 
this horrific event. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment in the RECORD, along with extra-
neous material, immediately prior to 
the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS), who is the ranking Republican 
member on the House Administration 
Committee, for a further explanation 
of this amendment. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I first want to thank the U.S. 
Police and the Sergeant at Arms em-
ployees who were here on the front 
lines protecting this Capitol last week 
during the unprecedented attack. It is 
imperative that we focus on ensuring a 
safe 
Inauguration 
Day, 
protecting 
Members and staff during this time of 
increased threats, and making sure 
that our Capitol Police officers have 
the support that they need. We need to 
ensure that what we saw happen a 
week ago today never happens again. 
Yesterday, I introduced, along with 
Representatives KATKO and COMER, a 
bill that would create a national com-
mission on the domestic terrorist at-
tack upon the United States Capitol. 
The bipartisan commission would con-
sist of 10 Members—5 Republicans, 5 
Democrats—appointed 
by 
the 
next 
President and by House and Senate 
leadership. This commission would be 
tasked with investigating the domestic 
terrorist attack that occurred in this 
building just a week ago, and it will 
provide us recommendations to prevent 
similar attacks from happening in the 
future. 
What we saw last week scared all of 
us who were here. But it also showed 
adversaries what it takes to take out a 
branch of government. 
When this commission is done with 
its investigation, it will submit a re-
port to the President and the Congress 
detailing its findings and recommenda-
tions to ensure that no foreign or do-
mestic 
adversary 
could 
accomplish 
what was done on January 6. We need 
to ensure that we fully understand 
what took place last week and any and 
all issues that occurred during our re-
sponse. 
Republicans and Democrats need to 
work together. We must unite to pre-
vent any attacks like this from hap-
pening in the future, and we must pro-
tect this institution, not just for us but 
for the American people. That is why 
we should defeat the previous question 
so that we can establish this bipartisan 
commission to equip us with the infor-
mation that we need to support our 
Capitol Police and the men and women 
who work in these buildings. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman of the Rules Committee 
for yielding. I congratulate him for his 
efforts down at the Rules Committee in 
acting and acting swiftly. 
I appreciate the remarks of Mr. COLE, 
for whom I have great respect, but I 
disagree with his sense of a lack of ur-
gency in action. I do agree with him of 
the consequences of our action. There 
are consequences to actions, and the 
actions of the President of the United 
States demand urgent and clear action 
by the Congress of the United States. 
The chairman of the committee in-
troduced the remarks and put them in 
the RECORD, but I want to reference the 
remarks of the chair of the Republican 
Conference, which is the analog to the 
Democratic Caucus. It is all the Repub-
licans elected to the Congress of the 
United States in the House of Rep-
resentatives. And they elected LIZ CHE-
NEY, the daughter of the Vice President 
of the United States, the former whip 
of this House, Dick Cheney, with whom 
I served in the eighties. 
Representative CHENEY, from Wyo-
ming, a conservative Republican, said 
this: ‘‘The President of the United 
States summoned this mob, assembled 
the mob, and lit the flame of this at-
tack.’’ 
That is not some irresponsible new 
Member of the Congress of the United 
States. This is the daughter of the 
former Republican whip and former 
Vice President of the United States of 
America. She knows of what she 
speaks. 
She said this as well: ‘‘There has 
never been a greater betrayal by a 
President of the United States of his 
office and his oath to the Constitu-
tion.’’ 
This is not, as LIZ CHENEY says, just 
some action. She characterized it as 
the biggest betrayal of any President 
of the United States in our history. 
Mr. JOHN KATKO—not a backbench 
Republican who just got here and 
doesn’t know what is going on—Mr. 
JOHN KATKO, who is the ranking Repub-
lican on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, says this: ‘‘To allow the Presi-
dent of the United States to incite this 
attack without consequence is a direct 
threat to the future of our democracy.’’ 
This is not some backbencher on 
their side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker. It 
reflects the sense of outrage and the 
sense of historic dissimilarity from the 
actions of any previous President. 
Then Mr. ADAM KINZINGER, a member 
of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and a senior Member from Illi-
nois—so we have a Member from Wyo-
ming, a Member from Illinois, and a 
Member from New York. There will be 
others on this vote who will join them. 
Mr. KINZINGER said this: ‘‘If these ac-
tions’’—he hasn’t had any hearings; he 
doesn’t need any long, drawn-out con-
sideration—‘‘If these actions are not 
worthy of impeachment, then what is 
an impeachable offense?’’ 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
the President of the United States 
broke his oath and incited this insur-
rection. 
I tell my friend, Mr. Speaker, a gen-
tleman for whom I have great respect— 
he is my friend, and I say that hon-
estly, not just as rhetoric that we say 
on this floor, because there are some 
that I don’t consider friends, whose 
values I do not share. That is not Mr. 
COLE. We have a difference. LIZ CHE-
NEY, JOHN KATKO, ADAM KINZINGER, and 
other Republicans whom I have talked 
to within the last 24 hours believe this 
action is required.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H155 
January 13, 2021 
b 0945 
Mr. Speaker, I see the gentleman 
from Ohio is on the floor. He likes to 
say that we Democrats were elected 
and the first thing we wanted to do was 
impeach this President. He is shaking 
his head in agreement because, like the 
President of the United States, he de-
nies the facts. Trump-like. Fake news. 
Mr. Speaker, December 6, 2017, Mr. 
GREEN, who I am going to refer to, of-
fered a motion because he saw the dan-
ger that confronted our country, and 
he filed a resolution of impeachment. 
On December 6, 2017, we had a vote on 
that, and the majority of Democrats 
voted ‘‘no’’—actually, they voted ‘‘yes’’ 
to table—so that we did not proceed in 
2017. 
The 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
GREEN) thought, however, the next 
year that there was still a danger to 
our country. Some of us shared that 
view, but we were not confident that 
the case could be made or that the 
transactions that preceded would lead 
to conviction. So, on January 19 of 
2018, we had a motion to table Mr. 
GREEN’s resolution, and the majority of 
Democrats voted to table that resolu-
tion. 
What a rush to judgment. 
And then, on July 17, 2019, 9 days be-
fore the call to Ukraine to get the 
Ukrainian leader to act on the political 
behalf of the President of the United 
States and where he withheld money to 
defend the Ukrainian people from Rus-
sian involvement and offered that as a 
bribe, on July 17, the majority of 
Democrats voted to table that resolu-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, there was no rush to 
judgment. 
Then that call to which I just re-
ferred was on July 26, 9 days later. I 
call that the ‘‘a-ha moment.’’ Yes, I 
knew what I thought, but that was 
proof. 
Some gentlemen have lamented that 
we didn’t know the whistleblower, be-
cause, after all, if we knew the whistle-
blower, we could intimidate everybody 
else from coming forward. This Presi-
dent has done everything he can to in-
timidate whistleblowers, people who 
came forward and told the truth. And 
we had witness after witness after wit-
ness who confirmed what the whistle-
blower brought to our attention. 
So, Mr. Speaker, the reason I rise 
today—and I am going to speak on the 
resolution itself at some later time—is 
to recognize the contributions that AL 
GREEN from Texas has made to getting 
us to this place. 
I am not going to read all of the reso-
lution, but I want to read some ex-
cerpts from the resolution he has intro-
duced. We won’t be considering his res-
olution. We will be considering Mr. 
CICILLINE’s resolution which over 200 
others have signed on to. 
Mr. GREEN had a resolution be intro-
duced: ‘‘Resolved, that Donald Trump, 
President of the United States’’ . . . 
‘’is impeached for high misdemeanors, 
and that the following Articles of Im-
peachment be exhibited to the Senate.’’ 
Article I says, ‘‘In his capacity as 
President of the United States, un-
mindful of the high duties of his high 
office and the dignity and proprieties 
thereof, and of the harmony and cour-
tesies 
necessary 
for 
stability’’—to 
which my friend spoke, the gentleman 
from Oklahoma—Donald John Trump, 
in violation of his constitutional oath 
to faithfully execute the Office of 
President ‘‘has harmed the society of 
the United States, brought shame and 
dishonor to the Office of President of 
the United States, sowing discord 
among the people of the United States’’ 
by weaponizing hate for political gain. 
He went on to say, ‘‘On January 6, 
2021, in a speech at the National Mall, 
President Donald Trump weaponized 
the hate that resulted in violence, the 
deaths of multiple people, an assault 
on democracy, and an insurrection 
against the Capitol of the United 
States of America by inciting a mob’’— 
who said that? LIZ CHENEY said it, and 
AL GREEN said it—infected with white 
supremacists carrying a rebel flag, 
erecting a gallows structure with a 
noose, wearing shirts and hateful mes-
sages such as ‘‘Camp Auschwitz: Work 
Brings Freedom’’ and ‘‘MAGA Civil 
War, January 6, 2021.’’ ‘‘MAGA Civil 
War.’’ 
They had the hats on of the army of 
MAGA, which I refer to as ‘‘Make 
America Grieve Again.’’ We grieved at 
Fort Sumter; we grieved on December 
7, 1941; and we grieved on 9/11. And, yes, 
we grieved on January 6 of this year. 
He goes on to say what the President 
told this mob that LIZ CHENEY said was 
recruited by the President of the 
United States. This is the President 
talking to this mob: 
‘‘All of us here today do not want to 
see our election victory stolen by bold 
and radical left Democrats’’—like the 
Secretary of State in Georgia and the 
Governor of Georgia—‘‘which is what 
they are doing, and stolen by the fake 
news media.’’ 
Inciting, riling up, creating anger 
with the fake news and lies that the 
President of the United States said to 
these folks. 
‘‘That is what they have done and 
what they are doing,’’ the President 
continued. ‘‘We will never give up. We 
will never concede. It doesn’t happen. 
You don’t concede when there is theft 
involved.’’ 
And so what did they do? Incited by 
this President, as LIZ CHENEY said, as 
JOHN KATKO said, as ADAM KINZINGER 
said, and, frankly, what Secretary 
Chao acted upon and what the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security acted 
upon and what so many others in the 
administration have acted upon—dis-
gusted, dismayed, and disheartened by 
what their President had done, they 
got out. They quit. 
The President further emboldened 
them, saying—this is the Green resolu-
tion. We are not considering it, but it 
is the Green resolution. The President 
further emboldened them, saying, ‘‘You 
will never take back our country with 
weakness.’’ 
We had a display of non-weakness, 
criminal insurrection-like conduct, re-
cruited by and deployed by the Presi-
dent of the United States to come to 
this Capitol and ‘‘stop the steal.’’ 
The ‘‘steal,’’ of course, was: We as-
sembled, accepting what all the courts 
that considered it said was a fair and 
accurate election of Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS as President and Vice 
President of the United States. 
After his National Mall speech, a 
mob of his supporters proceeded to the 
Capitol complex. We know that. 
And so Mr. GREEN’s resolution ends 
with, ‘‘Wherefore, to prevent national 
harm to our society, Donald John 
Trump, by such conduct, warrants an 
immediate impeachment trial and re-
moval from office and disqualification 
to hold and enjoy any office of honor, 
trust, or profit under the United States 
Constitution and the 14th Amend-
ment.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. GREEN is going to 
speak after me, but, in conclusion, let 
me tell my friend Mr. COLE: I have been 
here some time; he has as well. I served 
with Ronald Reagan, with George H.W. 
Bush, and George Bush. I had respect 
for all of those Presidents. They cared 
about our country, they honored our 
Constitution, and they executed the 
duties of their office consistent with 
the Constitution and laws of our coun-
try. 
That is not true of this President, 
and, therefore, he ought to be removed. 
We have that opportunity to do so. Is 
there little time left? Yes. But it is 
never too late to do the right thing. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN), my good friend. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
had tears well in my eyes as I heard 
Mr. HOYER, and I know that hearts are 
hurting. This is a very sad time in the 
history of our country. No one is cele-
brating. No one wants to see this occur. 
Mr. Speaker, I was at the Committee 
on Rules by way of Zoom. I was there 
for the entire hearing. Those Members 
on the other side, this is something 
that they understand and they take se-
riously. Regardless as to what is said, I 
could sense that they are hurting too. 
I just want to thank everyone for all 
that has happened and the appreciation 
that has been shown. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
an additional 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Texas. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, the healing that we 
talk about that has to begin, the heal-
ing has to start with some of these peo-
ple who were there initially, who 
helped to lay this foundation, 110 peo-
ple. 
I want to recognize Congresswoman 
MAXINE WATERS. A lot of them were 
threatened. Their lives were disrupted. 
Mr. Speaker, I include their names in 
the RECORD.

Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
may God bless our country as we go 
forward. 
MR. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. SMITH), my good friend, dis-
tinguished Republican Member, our 
leader of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
if we defeat the previous question, we 
will amend the rule to immediately 
bring up the bill establishing a bipar-
tisan national commission on the do-
mestic terror attack of the United 
States Capitol. 
This has been a devastating week for 
our Nation. Just last week, we stood 
right here in this very Chamber while a 
violent mob laid siege to the seat of 
American democracy. It is vital we get 
the facts on what went wrong last 
week, why the security apparatus 
failed, and how we can ensure it 
never—it never—happens again. 
Mr. Speaker, less than 50 feet from 
where we stand in this room, a young 
lady lost her life through those doors— 
through those doors. I was in this 
Chamber when those gunshots rang. 
That is real stuff. That should never 
happen in the people’s House. 
For the first time, can the House 
Democrats and the Speaker of the 
House put the people before politics? 
Please put the people before politics. 
At a time when our Nation is more di-
vided than ever before, let’s put people 
before politics. 
President Trump will be leaving in 7 
days. Let’s try to heal this Nation. 
Let’s listen to the American people. 
This is the people’s House. Let’s oper-
ate for the people. 
This country is hurting. The people 
are hurting. Our colleagues are hurt-
ing. 
This is a reckless impeachment. This 
will only bring up the hate and fire 
more than ever before. 
Have a conscience. Put the people be-
fore politics. Unify this country. 
b 1000 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
remind all of my colleagues that what 
happened on Wednesday would not 
have happened if it weren’t for the oc-
cupant in the White House. If we want 
to put the people first, we all ought to 
vote to impeach him and remove him 
from office as soon as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BROWNLEY). 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, today 
is a defining moment in our history. 
Congress was attacked by a mob di-
rected by the President of the United 
States. It was a horrible, terrifying sit-
uation. But we all know, deep in our 
hearts, that it could have been much, 
much worse. 
We simply cannot let it stand. We 
cannot let it stand for the very soul of 
our democracy. We cannot let the 
President of the United States leave of-
fice without acting. 
We are the oldest constitutional re-
public in the world, and our Capitol is 
a sacred symbol of our great democ-
racy. 
To my colleagues across the aisle, I 
appeal to your sense of service and 
duty to our Nation and to the oath we 
all swore to uphold. Before we are 
Democrats and Republicans, we are 
Americans. Let us come together to 
fulfill our oath by voting for the reso-
lution before us and by defending, pre-
serving, and honoring our democracy. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
South Carolina (Ms. MACE), one of our 
new Members, and note this is her first 
speech on the House floor. 
Ms. MACE. Mr. Speaker, this is not 
the reason I wanted to give my first 
speech in our Chamber, in our hallowed 
Halls. This is not what I wanted to do 
in my first week in office. But after the 
violent events of last week, watching 
and witnessing how heartbreaking this 
was, thank God I sent my kids home on 
Monday morning because I was worried 
about the rhetoric leading up to the 
events and to the rally on January 6, 
the violence that could transpire. 
Not only were our lives in danger but 
if my kids were here, their lives would 
have been in danger, too, the two most 
precious people in my life. 
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives has every right to im-
peach the President of the United 
States. What we are doing today, rush-
ing this impeachment in an hour- or 2- 
hour-long debate on the floor in this 
Chamber, bypassing Judiciary, poses 
great questions about the constitu-
tionality of this process. 
I believe we need to hold the Presi-
dent accountable. I hold him account-
able for the events that transpired, for 
the attack on our Capitol last Wednes-
day. I also believe we need to hold ac-
countable every single person, even 
Members of Congress, if they contrib-
uted to the violence that transpired 
here. 
But, today, I am asking my col-
leagues to remember the words of the 
legendary, great leader in this country, 
Dr. Martin Luther King, who once said 
the time is always right to do what is 
right. 
If we are serious about healing the 
division in this country, Republicans 
and Democrats need to acknowledge 
this is not the first day of violence we 
have seen. We have seen violence 
across our country for the last 9 
months. We need to recognize, number 
one, that our words have consequences, 
that there is violence on both sides of 
the aisle. We have contributed to it. We 
need to take responsibility for our 
words and our actions. We need to ac-
knowledge there is a problem, take re-
sponsibility for it, and stop being part 
of the problem and start being part of 
the solution. 
God bless every Member in the Cham-
ber today, and God bless the United 
States of America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H158 
January 13, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Vermont (Mr. WELCH). 
Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, our gov-
ernment is founded on the principle of 
all power flows from the people. 
Donald Trump challenged this prin-
ciple in two ways: Deceit and violence. 
The deceit is repeated in baseless as-
sertions of an electoral fraud. The vio-
lence, the attack on the United States 
Capitol on January 6, the mob was as-
sembled by Donald Trump, incited by 
Donald Trump, and in service of Don-
ald Trump’s effort to overturn, through 
violence, what he lost at the voting 
booth. 
The violent mob reached the Capitol; 
killed and injured Capitol Police; de-
stroyed property; threatened the Vice 
President, Members of Congress, and 
staff, all to obstruct the peaceful trans-
fer of power. 
If we want unity, we must have ac-
countability. So the question before 
this Congress: Will Congress condone 
through 
acquiescence 
or 
condemn 
through impeachment Donald Trump’s 
violent acts to overturn the election? 
Congress must impeach. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN), the distinguished Repub-
lican leader of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Mr. JORDAN. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in his opening remarks, 
the Democrat chair of the Rules Com-
mittee said that Republicans last week 
voted to overturn the results of an 
election. 
Guess who the first objector was on 
January 6, 2017, the first objector? The 
Democrat chair of the Rules Com-
mittee. And guess which State he ob-
jected to? Alabama. The very first 
State 
called, 
Alabama. 
President 
Trump, I think, won Alabama with 80 
points. Actually, he won it by 30 
points. 
They can object. They can object to 
Alabama in 2017 but tell us we can’t ob-
ject to Pennsylvania in 2021, Pennsyl-
vania where the State supreme court 
just unilaterally extended the election 
to Friday; Pennsylvania where the sec-
retary of state unilaterally changed 
the rules, went around the legislature 
in an unconstitutional fashion; Penn-
sylvania where county clerks in some 
counties, and you can imagine which 
counties they were, let people fix their 
ballots against the law, cure their bal-
lots, their mail-in ballots, a direct vio-
lation of law. And they tell us we tried 
to overturn the election? 
Guess who the second objector was in 
2017? The individual managing the im-
peachment for the Democrats. 
Americans are tired of the double 
standard. They are so tired of it. Demo-
crats objected to more States in 2017 
than Republicans did last week, but 
somehow we are wrong. 
Democrats can raise bail for rioters 
and looters this summer, but somehow 
when Republicans condemn all the vio-
lence, the violence this summer, the vi-
olence last week, somehow we are 
wrong. Democrats can investigate the 
President of the United States, as Mr. 
HOYER went through, tried to impeach 
him, investigate him for 4 years, but 
will not look at an election that 80 mil-
lion Americans, half the electorate, 80 
million, Republicans and Democrats, 
have their doubts about. 
I said this last night. I do not know 
where all this goes, and this is fright-
ening for the country. We should defeat 
this rule, and we should defeat the im-
peachment resolution when it comes up 
later this afternoon. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, some 
of us objected 4 years ago as a protest 
vote to raise concerns about what all of 
our intelligence agencies had stated 
clearly, which was that Russia had 
interfered in our election. 
What the gentleman fails to acknowl-
edge is that we all acknowledged that 
Donald Trump was the President the 
day after the election. Hillary Clinton 
conceded the day after the election. 
And none of us push conspiracy theo-
ries like some of my friends on the 
other side of the aisle have been doing, 
and this President, that somehow the 
President won in a landslide. Give me a 
break. 
Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, I 
asked the gentleman from Ohio if he 
would just say five simple words. Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell you that he was 
talking about healing. The five simple 
words that one could say that would 
help heal this Nation are that: ‘‘The 
election was not stolen.’’ That is it, 
five simple words. He refused. He said 
he never said the election was stolen. 
Well, the evidence shows otherwise. 
Let me reference this Dana Milbank 
piece titled ‘‘Five pesky little words 
keep stumping Jim Jordan.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this. 
This Capitol was stormed. People died 
because of the big lies that were being 
told by this President and by too many 
people on the other side of the aisle. 
Enough. People should be outraged as 
to what happened. It was unforgivable, 
unconscionable. Coming up on this 
floor and talking about whataboutism 
and trying to make these false equiva-
lencies, give me a break. 
The President of the United States 
instigated an attempted coup in this 
country. People died. Everybody should 
be outraged, whether you are a Demo-
crat or a Republican. If this is not an 
impeachable offense, I don’t know what 
the hell is. 
This President is not fit to remain in 
office. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, this was 
not a one-off. It was a long time com-
ing. It was a part of a plan to perpet-
uate Trump in office. 
Trump’s campaign strategy was: The 
election, the only way we can we lose 
is if it is stolen. It is stolen; it is fake. 
‘‘It is stolen,’’ repeated by many of his 
fellow travelers on that side, more 
than 150 times by Trump over the sum-
mer. 
Then, they litigated to disqualify 
voters. That didn’t work. 
Then, they litigated to throw out 
ballots. Well, that didn’t work. 
Then, they attempted to delay the 
count with State legislatures. Well, 
that didn’t work. 
Last ditch, the President called down 
to Georgia and said: Can’t you find me 
more votes? 
And then, one last desperate plea: 
Stop the January 6 certification. And 
the President talked about that on 
September 26. He said: You know, if it 
goes to Congress, there is one vote per 
State, and we have an advantage. 
So, I think this was part of a plan to 
disrupt the electoral college of the 
United States. 
Giuliani: ‘‘Trial by combat.’’ 
Trump: ‘‘You will never take back 
our country with weakness.’’ 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. RESCHENTHALER), a new 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I am deeply troubled by last week’s 
attack on our Capitol, and I pray for 
the families of Officer Sicknick and Of-
ficer Liebengood. 
As I have been saying all summer 
long, violence and rioting has no place 
in America. The criminals responsible 
for last week’s rioting must be brought 
to justice. At a time when our Nation 
is still healing, we must seek out issues 
to work on that unite us rather than 
issues that further divide us. 
I was greatly encouraged to see our 
country unite in condemnation of last 
week’s lawlessness and the rioting. I 
am further encouraged that, despite 
my Democrat colleagues’ claims to the 
contrary, President Trump is com-
mitted to a peaceful and uninterrupted 
transfer of power. 
But that is not good enough for my 
colleagues across the aisle. With just 7 
days left in President Trump’s term, 
they are fast-tracking impeachment 
proceedings, a move which will no 
doubt further divide an already frac-
tured Nation. 
Even House Democrats’ last impeach-
ment effort, which was rushed through 
in record time, at the very least, that 
had expert input, depositions, hearings, 
and deliberation. This latest attempt 
at impeachment ignores all precedent. 
It ignores all due process. It cannot be 
voted on in the Senate before Joe 
Biden is sworn into office. 
I am also very concerned by the 
charge against the President of ‘‘in-
citement of insurrection.’’ At his rally, 
President Trump urged attendees to 
‘‘peacefully and patriotically make 
your voices heard.’’ There was no men-
tion of violence, let alone calls to ac-
tion. 
Look, I prosecuted terrorists in the 
Navy. I was a defense attorney in the 
Navy JAG Corps. I was a district judge. 
Pull up the criminal statute. Look at 
the criminal code. President Trump’s

words would not even meet the defini-
tion of incitement under criminal stat-
utes. 
The measure before us today sets a 
dangerous precedent whereby political 
parties can justify impeachment sim-
ply because they do not agree with the 
President. I would, therefore, urge my 
colleagues across the aisle to just take 
a step back, let cooler heads prevail, 
and consider how the actions we are 
taking here today will alter the course 
of history, will lower an already low 
bar of impeachment for all future 
Presidencies. 
b 1015 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, when 
my friends talk about the President 
being committed to a peaceful transi-
tion, I just point to what happened on 
Wednesday when his words launched a 
violent attack against this Capitol 
where five people lost their lives and 
many more were injured. So give me a 
break. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Contrary to my good friend’s words, 
the President of the United States is 
an insurrectionist. He led an insurrec-
tion against the United States of 
America. 
Prior to the January 6 attack by vio-
lent domestic terrorists, the President 
spoke to the crowd for 1 hour, and 
these were his words. These were his 
words, which is that we cannot take 
the Nation back. We have to take the 
Nation back with strength, and you 
must go and do that. Those were the 
paraphrase of his words. 
The President provoked these domes-
tic terrorists with words, with actions 
and conduct that betray a contempt 
and hostility to the national value of 
equal justice under the law, telling do-
mestic terrorists, nearly all of them 
white supremacists, many of them, 
who 
support 
him 
politically, 
who 
stormed the Capitol to derail Congress 
from completing its constitutionally 
required duty of counting and verifying 
the vote. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, I rise in strong support of the 
rule governing debate on H. Res. 24, a resolu-
tion impeaching the current President of the 
United States for High Crimes and Mis-
demeanors, warranting his conviction and re-
moval from office and, in accordance with Arti-
cle I, Section 3, clause 7, disqualification from 
ever again holding and enjoying an Office of 
honor, Trust or Profit under the United 
States.’’ 
I strongly support the rule and the under-
lying resolution calling for impeachment and 
removal of this President because after the 
horrifying events of Wednesday last, January 
6, 2021, another day that will live in infamy, 
the continuance in office of this President for 
even one moment longer represents a clear 
and present threat to the security of the United 
States, its people, institutions, and democratic 
form of government. 
To put it in the words of the Framers, the 
current President’s conduct reflects and re-
veals a person ‘‘whose character is thus 
marked by every act which may define a ty-
rant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.’’ 
To put it in contemporary terms, the current 
President can rightly be said to be perhaps 
the leading cause of state-sponsored domestic 
terrorism. 
Every minute this President remains in of-
fice represents a minute of maximum peril to 
the American people and the American Exper-
iment. 
Unrepentant after his perfidious and treach-
erous conduct of Wednesday last, the Presi-
dent just yesterday went to Alamo, Texas, 
without giving any advance notice or consulta-
tion to the leaders of that community. 
Does anyone really doubt that the Presi-
dent’s true purpose in going to Alamo was to 
signal to his band of disloyalists his desire that 
they make a last stand and fight to the death 
in his name? 
I do not, and neither does the majority of 
the American people, and I suspect that in 
their heart of hearts, neither do our colleagues 
on the Republican side. 
Mr. Speaker, three facts demonstrate why 
immediate action to remove the President is 
essential. 
First, the abject failure and refusal of the 
President to take care that the laws be faith-
fully executed puts lives at risk. 
When the U.S. Capitol was besieged last 
week by domestic terrorists, the President ob-
structed and denied the request of the Mayor 
of the District of Columbia to call out the Na-
tional Guard to protect life and property; it took 
the Vice-President, working with Speaker 
PELOSI and incoming Senate Majority Leader 
SCHUMER to prevail upon the Department of 
Defense to come to the defense of the Capitol 
and the people trapped inside. 
Instead of acting in accordance with his sa-
cred oath to preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution and to take care that the people 
and property of the United States are pro-
tected against all enemies, foreign or domes-
tic, the President did nothing but watch the 
mayhem on television, ebullient at the enthusi-
astic display of support from his lawless loyal-
ists. 
Second, the current President’s conduct 
stands in stark and marked contrast to his 
conduct earlier this year when protests were 
sweeping the country in response to the mur-
der of George Floyd, when the President dis-
patched law enforcement authorities to put 
down peaceful protests led by moms and vet-
erans in Portland, Oregon and social justice 
activists in Washington, D.C. 
Back then, the President mobilized a heavy 
police presence, many on horseback and oth-
ers using tear gas, to clear Lafayette Square 
of peaceful protesters so he could walk across 
the street to have himself photographed 
clutching a bible upside down in front of a 
church. 
Third, the President’s words, actions, and 
conduct betray a contempt and hostility to the 
national value of equal justice under law, tell-
ing the domestic terrorists, many of whom 
were white supremacists who support him po-
litically, who stormed the Capitol to derail Con-
gress from completing its constitutionally re-
quired duty of counting and verifying the votes 
of presidential electors, that ‘‘we love you. 
You’re very special,’’ while referring to African 
Americans and other persons of color pro-
testing social injustice and inequalities in the 
criminal justice system as ‘‘animals,’’ ‘‘thugs,’’ 
and ‘‘anarchists.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the President’s actions inciting 
insurrection against the United States was the 
proximate cause of the horrifying siege of the 
U.S. Capitol, the destruction and desecration 
of the Citadel of Democracy, and the deaths 
of at least six persons, one of whom was a 
uniformed officer to the United States Capitol 
Police, whom was bludgeoned to death by the 
incited mob. 
Abusing the powers and resources of his 
high office, Donald John Trump has actively 
and continuously endeavored to undermine 
the essential institutions and foundations of a 
democratic system of government in the 
United States, engaging in a long train of 
abuses and usurptions, pursuing invariably the 
same object, evincing a design to make him-
self an authoritarian ruler unaccountable to, 
and independent of, the people of the United 
States. 
The utter unfitness of the President for the 
office he holds and his contempt for the sa-
cred oath he took before the nation with God 
as his witness, was vividly on display on Janu-
ary 6, 2021. 
But signs of his calumny were on display in 
plain sight, reflected by his misbehavior and 
malfeasance from the earliest days of his ad-
ministration. 
Abusing the powers and resources of his 
high office, this President has actively and 
continuously endeavored to undermine the es-
sential institutions and foundations of a demo-
cratic system of government in the United 
States, engaging in a long train of abuses and 
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same ob-
ject, evincing a design to make himself an au-
thoritarian ruler unaccountable to, and inde-
pendent of, the people of the United States 
by: 
(1) Soliciting and welcoming the assistance 
of a hostile foreign power to aid him in secur-
ing election in 2016 as President of the United 
States; 
(2) Refusing to acknowledge Russian inter-
ference in the internal affairs of the United 
States, and then opposing responses by Con-
gress and the Executive Branch to protect the 
national security and interests of the United 
States against future Russian interference and

that constitutionally required Joint Meeting of 
Congress for the purpose of counting the 
votes of electors and announcement of the re-
sult by the President of the Senate was illegit-
imate and intended to complete the theft of his 
victory; and 
(8) Failing to take action to protect and de-
fend Federal officers and personnel, property, 
buildings, and institutions on January 6, 2021, 
at the U.S. Capitol that was besieged by sup-
porters of Donald John Trump, resulting in ex-
tensive damage to the property of the United 
States and the deaths of at least four persons. 
This is why multiple Members of Congress, 
introduced resolutions of articles of impeach-
ment; joined by dozens of original cosponsors, 
I introduced H. Res. 26, impeaching the Presi-
dent for the High Crimes and Misdemeanors 
of (1) Abuse of Power and (2) Willful Refusal 
And Failure To Protect And Defend The Con-
stitution Of The United States. 
Mr. Speaker, Donald John Trump has acted 
in a manner contrary to his trust as President 
and subversive of constitutional government, 
to the great prejudice of the cause of law and 
justice, and to the manifest injury of the peo-
ple of the United States. 
He must be impeached, convicted, removed 
from office, and disqualified from ever again 
holding and enjoying an Office of honor, Trust 
or Profit under the United States. 
My love and reverence for the Constitution 
compels me to vote to impeach this President 
and I urge all my colleagues who revere the 
Constitution and our democracy, which has 
endured for more than 240 years, to join me 
in voting for the rule for H. Res. 24, so we can 
vote to impeach Donald John Trump for High 
Crimes and Misdemeanors against the United 
States. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. CARTER), my very 
good friend. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to this ef-
fort to move forward with impeach-
ment proceedings. 
What happened on Wednesday, Janu-
ary 6, was nothing short of pure anar-
chy. Those individuals who broke the 
law should be held accountable for 
their actions. They should be pros-
ecuted to the highest extent of the law, 
and they should be put in jail. 
This was one of the saddest days of 
my life, last Wednesday, Mr. Speaker. 
Our thoughts and our prayers are with 
the police officers and other law en-
forcement who carried out their duties 
on that tragic day, including Officers 
Sicknick and Liebengood. 
Right now, our focus should be on 
healing, healing our Nation. With so 
many upset and dismayed at the ac-
tions of last week, it is our responsi-
bility to chart a path forward, to sub-
due the growing animosity, and to find 
ways to heal our country. 
Unfortunately, I don’t believe this 
resolution will achieve those goals, es-
pecially 7 days ahead of the inaugura-
tion. This is a very serious and con-
cerning effort during such a tense and 
fragile time in our country. 
I urge my colleagues to consider how 
this would further entrench people dur-
ing such a tense time. I cannot support 
this. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All 
Members are reminded to wear face 
coverings while on the floor. All Mem-
bers and staff should be wearing face 
coverings while on the floor. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, for 
years Donald Trump has honored thugs 
worldwide who suppress democracy. 
For months, with a daily diet of lies, 
he has made clear his refusal to accept 
any election in which he was not the 
winner. 
After failing completely in his re-
peated attempts to intimidate both Re-
publican election officials into com-
mitting 
fraud 
and 
Republican-ap-
pointed judges into ignoring our Con-
stitution, he made a desperate attempt 
last week to block the final election 
count and prevent the peaceful transi-
tion of power essential to democracy. 
Trump basically attempted to over-
throw the government, to violently 
overthrow the first branch of govern-
ment, this Congress. 
Like his deadly reaction to the pan-
demic, he totally bungled the deadly 
attack. Both his frenzied riotous mob 
and his congressional enablers were de-
feated. America, we did ‘‘stop the 
steal.’’ We stopped Donald Trump from 
stealing our democracy and imposing 
himself as a tyrant. 
Today, we not only demand account-
ability for his gross misconduct, but 
more importantly, we declare to the 
next Trump-like aspiring tyrant, not in 
America, we love our democracy too 
much. Our Capitol is scarred, but our 
democracy 
survives. 
Violating 
his 
sworn duty to protect and defend our 
Constitution by seeking to violently 
overthrow the government by inciting 
violence, lighting the flames of a dead-
ly insurrection. If this is not impeach-
able, nothing is. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I advise the 
Chair that I have additional speakers 
on the way, but they are having a dif-
ficult time. I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. On November 3, the 
American people voted overwhelmingly 
for Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS to 
serve as President and Vice President 
of the United States. 
The country was about to enter a 
new era, with great hope for change. 
Yet, with a decisive mandate and ma-
jority, the President used untruthful 
claims to end the completion of a con-
stitutional process of collecting the 
electoral 
votes 
making 
Joe 
Biden 
President of the United States. 
Not accepting the will of the Amer-
ican people, the President unleashed 
the most horrific violence that over-
whelmed the security forces at this 
Capitol, which was overrun for the first 
time since 1812, putting the lives of so 
many at risk—indeed, a day of infamy. 
This impeachment will be viewed as 
a transcendent vote, where all will be 
judged. Vote to impeach the President 
of the United States, Donald J. Trump. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. CASTOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding me 
the time. 
I rise today to urge the impeachment 
of Donald Trump because the attack on 
the Capitol and the Congress was the 
single most depraved betrayal of the 
U.S. Constitution ever committed by a 
President. The traitorous incitement of 
an insurrection demands not just im-
peachment but removal from office im-
mediately. 
Violence 
during 
the 
transfer 
of 
power, Confederate flags, anti-Semitic 
paraphernalia desecrated this Capitol. 
Accountability must come swiftly. We 
must act with the same resoluteness 
we showed in the early morning hours 
after the insurrection, where we en-
sured the will of the voters was effec-
tuated. 
Donald Trump’s defilement of this 
Capitol will not stand. It demands im-
peachment now. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute the distinguished gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP), who 
is my very good friend. 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding me the time. 
These articles charge incitement. 
Once before, the House impeached a 
President of the United States within a 
week of the alleged offense. That was 
President Andrew Johnson days after 
he removed Secretary of War Edwin 
Stanton in 1868. Over 50 years later, the 
Supreme Court declared unconstitu-
tional the Tenure of Office Act that 
President Johnson had refused to obey. 
In other words, the House was not 
only hasty, it was wrong, punishing 
noncompliance with the unconstitu-
tional law. At least when that oc-
curred, the constitutionality of the law 
in question was unsettled. Here, how-
ever, an angry House majority races to 
impeachment in direct violation of set-
tled constitutional law. 
Again, the articles before the House 
charge 
incitement 
to 
insurrection. 
They do not specify inciting language. 
The law is well settled: ‘‘What is re-
quired, to forfeit constitutional protec-
tion, is incitement speech that ‘specifi-
cally advocates’ for listeners to take 
unlawful action.’’ 
The violence last Wednesday was ab-
horrent. Perpetrators should be pros-
ecuted. Those responsible for security 
decisions held accountable. Congress 
can disapprove, revile, condemn, even 
censure. But Congress cannot, con-
sistent with the rule of law, punish 
that which the Constitution’s First 
Amendment declares protected. If my 
colleagues do it, the violators of the 
duty to this Constitution, however 
angry, will be those who vote for this 
Article of Impeachment. It is not Mr.

GREEN’s Article of Impeachment. It is 
incitement, and the Constitution is 
settled on that point. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. OMAR). 
Ms. OMAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding me the time. 
Let us not mince words about what 
happened last week. It was a violent 
attempt to interrupt our democratic 
process. It was a targeted blow at the 
most essential process that makes us a 
democracy. It was directly and specifi-
cally incited by the President of the 
United States. 
For years, we have been asked to 
turn a blind eye to the criminality, 
corruption, and blatant disregard to 
the rule of law by the tyrant President 
we have in the White House. We, as a 
nation, can no longer look away. 
The President not only incited an in-
surrection against our government but 
has, in word and deed, led a rebellion. 
We cannot simply move past this or 
turn the page. For us to be able to sur-
vive as a functioning democracy, there 
has to be accountability. 
We must impeach and remove this 
President from office immediately so 
that he cannot be a threat to our de-
mocracy. 
I stand ready to fulfill my oath of of-
fice. I challenge my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to do the same. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a New York Times 
article 
published 
January 
9 
titled 
‘‘ ‘Our President Wants Us Here’: The 
Mob That Stormed the Capitol.’’ It is 
another example of why our country 
cannot risk even one more day of Don-
ald Trump. 
[From the New York Times, Jan. 9, 2021] 
OUR PRESIDENT WANTS US HERE: THE MOB 
THAT STORMED THE CAPITOL 
(By Dan Barry, Mike McIntire and Matthew 
Rosenberg) 
It was the table setter for what would 
come, with nearly 2,000 people gathering in 
Washington on Tuesday evening for a ‘‘Rally 
to Save America.’’ Speaker after angry 
speaker stoked stolen-election conspiracy 
theories and name-checked sworn enemies: 
Democrats and weak Republicans, Com-
munists and Satanists. 
Still, the crowd seemed a bit giddy at the 
prospect of helping President Trump reverse 
the result of the election—though at times 
the language evoked a call to arms. ‘‘It is 
time for war,’’ one speaker declared. 
As the audience thinned, groups of young 
men emerged in Kevlar vests and helmets, a 
number of them holding clubs and knives. 
Some were aligned with the neofascist Proud 
Boys; others with the Three Percenters, a 
far-right militia group. 
‘‘We’re not backing down anymore,’’ said a 
man with fresh stitches on his head. ‘‘This is 
our country.’’ 
That night reflected a disconcerting mix of 
free speech and certain menace; of everyday 
Americans supporting their president and ex-
tremists prepared to commit violence for 
him. All had assembled in answer to Mr. 
Trump’s repeated appeals to attend a march 
to the Capitol the next day that he promised 
would be ‘‘wild.’’ 
It was. By Wednesday afternoon, a narrow 
group of Trump supporters—some exuberant, 
some hellbent—had been storm-tossed to-
gether into infamy. A mob overran the na-
tion’s Capitol, as lawmakers hid in fear. 
Wholesale vandalism. Tear gas. Gunfire. A 
woman dead; an officer dead; many injured. 
Chants of ‘‘U.S.A.! U.S.A.!’’ 
But the insurrection failed. 
It had been the culmination of a sustained 
assault by the president and his enablers on 
fact-based reality, one that began long be-
fore the November election but took on a fe-
vered urgency as the certainty of Mr. 
Trump’s defeat solidified. For years, he had 
demonized political opponents and the media 
and egged on thuggish behavior at his ral-
lies. 
Since losing to Joseph R. Biden Jr., he had 
mounted a campaign of lies that the presi-
dency was being stolen from him, and that 
marching on the Capitol was the last chance 
to stop it. To many Americans, it looked 
like one more feel-good rally to salve Mr. 
Trump’s wounded ego, but some of his sup-
porters heard something altogether dif-
ferent—a battle cry. 
Now, dozens of them have been arrested— 
including an armed Alabama man who had 
Molotov cocktails in his car and a West Vir-
ginia lawmaker charged with illegally enter-
ing the Capitol—and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation is asking for help in identi-
fying those who ‘‘actively instigated vio-
lence.’’ Many participants in the march are 
frantically working to erase digital evidence 
of their presence for fear of losing a job or 
being harassed online. 
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been broadly 
condemned and cut off from his social media 
megaphones, as a new administration pre-
pares to take power. 
Kevin Haag, 67, a retired landscaper from 
North Carolina who ascended the Capitol 
steps as the crowd surged forward, said he 
did not go inside and disapproved of those 
who did. Even so, he said he would never for-
get the sense of empowerment as he looked 
down over thousands of protesters. It felt so 
good, he said, to show people: ‘‘We are here. 
See us! Notice us! Pay attention!’’ 
Now, back home after several days of re-
flection, Mr. Haag, an evangelical Christian, 
wonders whether he went too far. ‘‘Should I 
get down on my knees and ask for forgive-
ness?’’ he said in an interview. ‘‘I am asking 
myself that question.’’ 
But the experience seemed to have only 
hardened the resolve of others. Couy Griffin, 
47, a Republican county commissioner from 
New Mexico, spoke of organizing another 
Capitol rally soon—one that could result in 
‘‘blood running out of that building’’—in a 
video he later posted to the Facebook page of 
his group, Cowboys for Trump. 
Couy Griffin, a Republican county commis-
sioner from New Mexico and organizer of the 
group Cowboys for Trump, said a future Cap-
itol rally could have ‘‘blood running out of 
that building.’’ ‘‘You want to say that that 
was a mob? You want to say that was a vio-
lence? No, sir, no, ma’am, no. We could have 
a Second Amendment rally on those same 
steps that we had that rally yesterday. You 
know, and if we do, then it’s going to be a 
sad day, because there’s going to be blood 
running out of that building. But at the end 
of the day, you mark my word, we will plant 
our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and 
Chuck Schumer and Donald J. Trump, if it 
boils down to it.’’

sioner from New Mexico and organizer of the

itol rally could have ‘‘blood running out of

Trump via YouTube. ‘‘At the end of the day, 
you mark my word, we will plant our flag on 
the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schu-
mer,’’ he said. He paused before adding, ‘‘And 
Donald J. Trump if it boils down to it.’’ 
Plans take shape online: ‘Pack a crowbar’. 
The advance publicity for the ‘‘March for 
America’’ had been robust. Beyond the re-
peated promotions in tweets by the president 
and his allies, the upcoming event was 
cheered on social media, including Twitter, 
Facebook and Instagram. 
But woven through many of the messages 
to stand up for Mr. Trump—and, if possible, 
block the congressional certification of the 
election he claimed he had won—was lan-
guage that flirted with aggression, even vio-
lence. 
For example, the term ‘‘Storm the Cap-
itol’’ was mentioned 100,000 times in the 30 
days preceding Jan. 6, according to Zignal 
Labs, a media insights company. Many of 
these mentions appeared in viral tweet 
threads that discussed the possible storming 
of the Capitol and included details on how to 
enter the building. 
To followers of QAnon, the convoluted col-
lection of conspiracy theories that falsely 
claims the country is dominated by deep- 
state bureaucrats and Democrats who wor-
ship Satan, the word ‘‘storm’’ had particular 
resonance. Adherents have often referred to 
a coming storm, after which Mr. Trump 
would preside over a new government order. 
In online discussions, some QAnon fol-
lowers and militia groups explored which 
weapons and tools to bring. ‘‘Pack a crow-
bar,’’ read one message posted on Gab, a so-
cial media refuge for the far right. In an-
other discussion, someone asked, ‘‘Does any-
one know if the windows on the second floor 
are reinforced?’’ 
Still, the many waves of communication 
did not appear to result in a broadly orga-
nized plan to take action. It is also unclear 
if any big money or coordinated fund-raising 
was behind the mobilization, though some 
Trump supporters appear to have found 
funds through opaque online networks to 
help pay for transportation to the rally. 
‘‘Patriots, if you need financial help get-
ting to DC to support President Trump on 
January 6th, please go to my website,’’ a 
QAnon adherent who identified himself as 
Thad Williams, of Tampa, Fla., posted on 
Twitter three days before the event. He said 
he had raised more than $27,000. (After the 
Capitol assault, the money transfer compa-
nies PayPal and Stripe shut down his ac-
counts. Mr. Williams did not return a phone 
message, but the website for his organiza-
tion, Joy In Liberty, said it had given out 
$30,000 to fund transportation for ‘‘deserving 
patriots.’’) 
Other rally goers set up fund-raising ac-
counts 
through 
the 
online 
service 
GoFundMe; Buzzfeed News cited at least a 
dozen, and GoFundMe has since closed them. 
One of the most conspicuous figures in the 
Capitol assault—a bare-chested man with a 
painted face, flag-draped spear and fur hat 
with horns—was linked to the online fund- 
raising. A familiar presence at pro-Trump 
rallies in Phoenix, Jacob Anthony Chansley, 
a 33–year-old voiceover actor, is known as 
the Q Shaman. He started a GoFundMe ac-
count in December to help pay for transpor-
tation to another Trump demonstration in 
Washington, but the effort reportedly netted 
him just $10. Mr. Chansley retweeted Mr. 
Williams’s funding offer on Jan. 3, but it is 
unclear whether he benefited from it. 
On Tuesday, the eve of the march, a couple 
thousand people gathered at Freedom Plaza 
in Washington for ‘‘The Rally to Save Amer-
ica’’ event, permitted as ‘‘The Rally to Re-
vival.’’ The disparate interests of those at-
tending were reflected by the speakers: well- 
known 
evangelists, 
alt-right 
celebrities 
(Alex Jones of Infowars) and Trump loyal-
ists, including his former national security

adviser Michael Flynn and the self-described 
Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone, both 
of whom he had pardoned. 
The speakers repeatedly encouraged the 
attendees to see themselves as foot soldiers 
fighting to save the country. Americans, Mr. 
Flynn said, were ready to ‘‘bleed’’ for free-
dom. 
‘‘The members of the House of Representa-
tives, the members of the United States Sen-
ate, those of you who are feeling weak to-
night, those of you that don’t have the moral 
fiber in your body, get some tonight,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Because tomorrow, we the people are 
going to be here and we want you to know we 
will not stand for a lie.’’ 
Inside the Capitol descends into chaos. It 
was President Trump’s turn. At about noon 
on Wednesday, he emerged from a viewing 
party in a tent, strode onto a stage set up in 
a park just south of the White House and, for 
more than an hour, delivered a stream of in-
flammatory words. 
He exhorted the crowd of more than 8,000 
to march to the Capitol to pressure law-
makers: ‘‘Because you’ll never take back our 
country with weakness. You have to show 
strength and you have to be strong.’’ 
Even before he had finished speaking, peo-
ple started moving east toward the Capitol. 
The crowd included supporters who had come 
by caravan from across the country, Trump 
flags rippling in the wind, as well as people 
so moved by the president’s appeal for sup-
port that they had jumped into their cars 
and driven for hours. 
They traveled from various corners of re-
sentment in 21st-century America. Whether 
motivated by a sense of economic disenfran-
chisement or distrust of government, by big-
otry, or conspiracy or a belief that Mr. 
Trump is God’s way of preparing for the Rap-
ture, they shared a fealty to the president. 
Now the moment had come, a moment that 
twinned the thrilling with the ominous. 
‘‘I’m happy, sad, afraid, excited,’’ said 
Scott Cyganiewicz, 56, a floor installer from 
Gardner, Mass., as he watched the throngs of 
Trump loyalists streaming through the 
streets. ‘‘It’s an emotional roller coaster.’’ 
American flags and Trump paraphernalia 
mingled in the crowd. Credit . . . Pete 
Marovich for The New York Times. Mr. 
Cyganiewicz said he was on his way out of 
town. He did not want to be around if vio-
lence broke out. Only a portion of the broad-
er crowd continued onto the Capitol grounds. 
Soon word spread that Vice President Mike 
Pence—who would oversee the pro forma 
count by Congress of the electoral votes for 
certification—had announced he would not 
be complicit in the president’s efforts to 
overturn the election. 
‘‘You can imagine the emotion that ran 
through people when we get that word,’’ said 
Mr. Griffin, the county commissioner from 
New Mexico, in a video he posted on social 
media. ‘‘And then we get down to the Capitol 
and they have all the inauguration set up for 
Joe Biden.’’ 
He added, ‘‘What do you think was going to 
happen?’’ 
Many in the crowd spoke portentously of 
violence—or even of another Civil War. A 
man named Jeff, who said he was an off-duty 
police officer from York County, Pa., said he 
didn’t know what would happen after he and 
his wife Amy reached the Capitol. But he felt 
ready to participate if something were to 
erupt. 
‘‘There’s a lot of people here willing to 
take orders,’’ he said. ‘‘If the orders are 
given, the people will rise up.’’ 
By the time the bulk of the crowd reached 
the building, its leading edge had metasta-
sized into an angry mob. A man barked into 
a megaphone: ‘‘Keep moving forward! Fight 
for Trump, fight for Trump!’’ 
‘‘Military Tribunals! Hang them!’’ shouted 
someone wearing a cowboy hat. 
Arrest Congress!’’ screamed a woman in a 
flag scarf. 
People surged past a few Capitol Police of-
ficers to bang on the windows and doors. 
Many eyewitness accounts and videos have 
since emerged that convey the pandemonium 
as hundreds of people overwhelmed the inad-
equate law-enforcement presence. In several 
instances of role reversal, for example, riot-
ers are seen firing what appeared to be pep-
per spray at police officers trying to prevent 
mobs from getting closer to the Capitol 
Building. 
After a few minutes, the crowd broke 
through and began streaming into an empty 
office. Glass shards crunched under people’s 
feet, as the scene descended into chaos. 
Some stood in awe, while others took ac-
tion. As one group prepared to break through 
an entryway, a Trump supporter raised a 
wine bottle and shouted, ‘‘Whose way?’’ To 
which the crowd responded, ‘‘Our way!’’ 
Confusion reigned. ‘‘Hey what’s the Senate 
side?’’ said a tall man in camouflage and 
sunglasses. 
‘‘Where’s 
the 
Senate? 
Can 
somebody 
Google it?’’ 
All the while, members of The Oath Keep-
ers, 
a 
self-proclaimed 
citizens’ 
militia, 
seemed to be standing guard—or the trans-
gressors. They wore olive-drab shirts, hel-
mets and patches on their upper-left sleeves 
that said, ‘‘Guardians of the Republic’’ and 
‘‘Not on Our Watch.’’ 
American flags flapped beside ‘‘Trump 
2020’’ flags, and people wearing ‘‘Make Amer-
ica Great Again’’ regalia moved beside peo-
ple wearing anti-Semitic slogans. Chants of 
‘‘Hell No, Never Joe’’ and ‘‘Stop the Steal’’ 
broke out, as did strains of ‘‘God Bless Amer-
ica’’ and ‘‘The Star-Spangled Banner.’’ 
Derrick Evans of West Virginia, who just 
two months before had been elected as a Re-
publican state delegate, wandered the halls 
of the Capitol Building, filming himself and 
joining in the occasional chant. At one point 
he shouted, ‘‘Derrick Evans is in the Cap-
itol!’’ 
Outside the building, Mr. Griffin, who was 
once photographed wearing a 10–gallon hat 
and sitting across from President Trump in 
the Oval Office, was now gleefully addressing 
the camera from atop one of the crowded ter-
races, declaring it ‘‘a great day for Amer-
ica.’’ Asserting that ‘‘we came peacefully,’’ 
he was interrupted by a man wearing a jack-
et with a hand-grenade logo, who said, ‘‘Be-
lieve me, we are well armed if we need to 
be.’’ 
Amid the cheers and whoops of excitement 
were questions of what to do next. Some can 
be heard hunting for specific members of 
congress, including House Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi, whose office was broken into by sev-
eral people. She and other lawmakers were 
hiding for fear of their safety. 
One image showed a trim man moving 
through the Senate chamber in full para-
military regalia: camouflage uniform, Kevlar 
vest, a mask and baseball cap obscuring his 
face. He carried a stack of flex cuff—the 
plastic restraints used by police. The image 
raised a question yet to be answered: Why 
carry restraints if not to use them? 
Several rioters wielded fire extinguishers. 
One stood on a balcony on the Capitol build-
ing’s west side, spraying down on police offi-
cers trying to fend off the crowd. Others car-
ried them into the building itself, one into 
Statuary Hall and another onto the steps 
outside the Senate Chamber, spraying in the 
direction of journalists and police officers. 
Our president wants us here,’’ a man can be 
heard saying during a livestream video that 
showed him standing within the Capitol 
building. ‘‘We wait and take orders from our 
president.’’ 
Despite his followers’ hopes and expecta-
tions, President Trump was missing in ac-
tion as rioters rampaged through the halls of 
Congress. It would be hours before he eventu-
ally 
surfaced 
in 
a 
somewhat 
subdued 
videotaped appeal for them to leave. 
‘‘We have to have peace,’’ he said. ‘‘So go 
home, we love you, you’re very special.’’ 
Some of Mr. Trump’s supporters expressed 
frustration, even disbelief, that the president 
seemed to have given up after they had put 
themselves on the line for him. 
Mr. Haag, the retired landscaper, was 
among the disappointed. Still, he said, the 
movement will continue even without Mr. 
Trump. 
We are representing the 74 million people 
who got disenfranchised,’’ he said. ‘‘We are 
still out here. We are a force to be reckoned 
with. We are not going away.’’ 
One man wandered away from the Capitol 
in 
the 
evening 
gloom, 
yelling 
angrily 
through a megaphone that Mr. Pence was a 
coward and, now, Mr. Trump had told every-
one ‘‘to just go home.’’ 
Well, he can go home to his Mar-a-Lago es-
tate,’’ the man shouted, adding, ‘‘We gotta 
go back to our businesses that are closed!’’ 
As some rioters face fallout, others mull a 
repeat. In the aftermath of what Mitch 
McConnell, the Senate majority leader, 
called a ‘‘failed insurrection,’’ scores of those 
who responded to the incendiary words of the 
president now face a reckoning. 
A chief target of investigators will be who-
ever struck Brian Sicknick of the Capitol 
Police with a fire extinguisher; the 42–year- 
old officer died Thursday after being injured 
in the riot. At the same time, authorities are 
investigating the fatal police shooting of 
Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran who 
had joined those breaching the Capitol. 
Among those charged so far with federal 
crimes are Mr. Chansley, the so-called Q 
Shaman; Mr. Evans, the West Virginia law-
maker—who resigned on Saturday; and Rich-
ard Barnett, an Arkansas man who was de-
picted in a widely circulated photograph sit-
ting with his foot on a desk in Ms. Pelosi’s 
office. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Griffin, the commissioner 
from New Mexico who runs Cowboys for 
Trump, saw his group’s Twitter account sus-
pended and calls for his resignation. 
The anger, resentment and conspiracy- 
laced distrust that led to Wednesday’s may-
hem did not dissipate with Thursday’s dawn. 
Along with the smashed furniture in the 
Capitol Building, there were smashed expec-
tations of a continued Trump presidency, of 
lawmakers held to account, of holy proph-
ecies fulfilled. 
Signs of potential violence have already 
surfaced. Twitter, which terminated Mr. 
Trump’s account on Friday, noted that 
‘‘plans for future armed protests have al-
ready begun proliferating’’ online, including 
‘‘a proposed secondary attack on the U.S. 
Capitol and state capitol buildings on Janu-
ary 17.’’ 
The urge for more civil unrest is being dis-
cussed in the usual squalid corners of the 
internet. Private chat groups on Gab and 
Parler are peppered with talk of a possible 
‘‘Million Militia March’’ on Jan. 20 that 
would disrupt the presidential inauguration 
of Mr. Biden. 
There is chatter about ride shares, where 
to find lodging in the Washington area—and 
what to bring. Baseball bats, perhaps, or as-
sault rifles. 
‘‘We took the building once,’’ one com-
menter posted, ‘‘we can take it again.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H163 
January 13, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, last week, Congress was 
under siege by a mob motivated and di-
rected by the President of the United 
States. Our Vice President was a target 
of that mob. Members of Congress, 
both Democrats and Republicans, were 
targets of this mob. And I witnessed, 
for the first time in my life, Americans 
fighting Americans, all at the behest of 
our 
own 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States. As Americans, we can do bet-
ter. 
I will vote for impeachment today for 
our Nation, for our children, and for 
our grandchildren. I will be voting for 
impeachment so that America will 
once again be the shining city upon the 
hill whose beacon light guides freedom- 
loving people everywhere. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me and vote for impeachment. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I 
ask the gentleman how many more 
speakers he may have? 
Mr. COLE. Whenever the gentleman 
is prepared to close, we will close. We 
were hopeful that one of our speakers 
would arrive, but they are having a dif-
ficult time getting here. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. We have exhausted 
all of our speakers. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for pre-
siding over these difficult proceedings 
today. I thank my good friend, the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee. And I thank everybody who 
came to the floor and had something to 
say at an important moment. 
I think the debate, while spirited, re-
flected the civility and decency of the 
institution that we are all privileged to 
be part of. I am very proud to have 
been part of it. I am very proud of all 
the Members and the manner in which 
they participated. 
I want, again, to thank the staff and 
thank those who kept us safe in the 
process, particularly the Capitol Po-
lice. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this rule, and I 
oppose the majority’s actions today. 
After the traumatic events of last 
week, the majority should be taking 
steps to unite us. Instead, they are 
only dividing us further. 
They are rushing to judgment, in my 
opinion, and bringing up impeachment 
after failing to follow any meaningful 
process whatsoever. No hearings have 
been held, no witnesses heard, no proc-
ess or opportunity to respond was pro-
vided to the President. No Members 
had an opportunity to review or amend 
this article before it came to the floor. 
This is hardly the way the House 
should undertake such a serious act. 
b 1030 
Mr. Speaker, there is still a way to 
unite the country. Let us look forward, 
not backward. Let us come together, 
not apart. Let us celebrate the peaceful 
transition of power to a new President 
rather than impeaching an old Presi-
dent. And let us affirm and reaffirm 
with one united voice that the House 
does not rush to judgment on the most 
consequential action we can take. Mr. 
Speaker, we deserve better than that 
and the American people deserve better 
than that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, as 
they reflect on this minute and we 
move into our next stage of debate, to 
remember that we are all privileged to 
represent a great and a good people. We 
have gone through a horrifying and 
tragic time, and we owe them the op-
portunity to reflect and we owe them 
our best efforts to bring everyone to-
gether. 
I know people on this floor feel very 
passionately about this subject with 
different points of view. I honor each 
one of those points of view and I honor 
the people that voice them. Let’s re-
member when we are through this that 
we are one people and that we have one 
purpose, that we are free through the 
grace of God and millions of brave 
Americans over centuries of time and 
we will remain that way, and we will 
move forward together once we settle 
this debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous question, 
‘‘no’’ on the rule, ‘‘no’’ on the under-
lying measure, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my friend, the ranking mem-
ber of the Rules Committee, Mr. COLE, 
for his friendship and for the way he 
conducts himself in this Chamber. I 
know he has great respect for this in-
stitution. 
Mr. Speaker, it is impossible for me 
to fully capture the reverence that I 
have for the United States Capitol. I 
worked on these grounds starting back 
when I was a college intern working for 
Senator George McGovern back in 1977. 
No relation. Great last name. 
Since that time, I have done every-
thing from working as a staffer for 
Congressman Joe Moakley of Massa-
chusetts to being elected to the United 
States House of Representatives my-
self. 
But that internship will always be a 
high point of my life: Coming here for 
the first time, walking these hallowed 
Halls, and seeing the glory of American 
democracy up close. 
The idea that someone would incite 
an out-of-control mob of homegrown 
fascists and domestic terrorists to 
desecrate the people’s House fills me 
with a deep sadness for our country. 
The contempt that these people had for 
our democracy and our freedom fills 
me with horror. 
What Donald Trump did, encouraging 
them, fills me with rage not just on be-
half of all of those serving here, but all 
of those who work in these Halls. And 
I am talking about the reporters, the 
cafeteria workers, the custodians, the 
Clerks, the Parliamentarians—I can go 
on and on and on—and the staff, the 
Democratic staff, the Republican staff, 
the nonpartisan support staff, who 
were terrorized, some hiding under 
their desks and barricading in their of-
fices. 
I was in the Speaker’s chair the day 
this unfolded, and many of the people 
who are sitting up there now were 
present at that time. What a horrifying 
thing for anybody to have to experi-
ence. 
Now, some of my Republican friends 
have been trying to lecture us about 
unity here today after they voted to 
overturn a free and fair election of the 
United States of America, but also 
preaching unity and not acknowledging 
that, for 4 years, many of them gave 
oxygen to Donald Trump’s conspiracy 
theories, to the big lies. They have 
turned the other way in the face of rac-
ism and bigotry and how he embraced 
some of the most intolerant voices in 
this country. They just let it go. 
I will remind everybody here that 
words have consequences, and ignoring 
words that are wrong also have con-
sequences. What happened would never 
have happened if everybody stood up in 
unity and called out the President 
when he was not telling the American 
people the truth, when he was pushing 
a big lie. We will never have unity 
without truth and also without ac-
countability. 
This week in Congress, we saw the 
best of us and the worst of us. Some of 
my colleagues have shown that they 
will defend this President no matter 
what he does. There is nothing that he 
could do that would dissuade them 
from all-out support. But some are 
standing up and doing the right thing 
under tremendous pressure, and I am 
proud of that and I honor them for 
their courage. 
This impeachment resolution out-
lines the truth of what Trump did. It is 
time that this Congress now holds him 
accountable for his words and for their 
devastating impact. 
Last week, we took an oath to pro-
tect this Nation. As history calls on us 
today, I pray that we all have the 
moral clarity to uphold it here today. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 41 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
275) to establish the National Commission on 
the Domestic Terrorist Attack Upon the 
United States Capitol. All points of order 
against consideration of the bill are waived. 
The bill shall be considered as read. All 
points of order against provisions in the bill 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Homeland Security; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 275. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution.

IMPEACHING 
DONALD 
JOHN 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES, 
FOR 
HIGH 
CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 41, I call up 
the resolution (H. Res. 24) impeaching 
Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, for high crimes and mis-
demeanors, and ask for its immediate 
consideration in the House. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 24 
Resolved, That Donald John Trump, Presi-
dent of the United States, is impeached for 
high crimes and misdemeanors and that the 
following article of impeachment be exhib-
ited to the United States Senate: 
Article of impeachment exhibited by the 
House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in the name of itself and 
of the people of the United States of Amer-
ica, against Donald John Trump, President 
of the United States of America, in mainte-
nance and support of its impeachment 
against him for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
ARTICLE I: INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION 
The Constitution provides that the House 
of Representatives ‘‘shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment’’ and that the Presi-
dent ‘‘shall be removed from Office on Im-
peachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other high Crimes and Mis-
demeanors’’. Further, section 3 of the 14th 
Amendment to the Constitution prohibits 
any person who has ‘‘engaged in insurrection 
or rebellion against’’ the United States from 
‘‘hold[ing] any office . . . under the United 
States’’. In his conduct while President of 
the United States—and in violation of his 
constitutional oath faithfully to execute the 
office of President of the United States and, 
to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, 
and defend the Constitution of the United 
States, and in violation of his constitutional 
duty to take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed—Donald John Trump engaged in 
high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting 
violence against the Government of the 
United States, in that: 
On January 6, 2021, pursuant to the 12th 
Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States, the Vice President of the 
United States, the House of Representatives, 
and the Senate met at the United States 
Capitol for a Joint Session of Congress to 
count the votes of the Electoral College. In 
the months preceding the Joint Session, 
President Trump repeatedly issued false 
statements asserting that the Presidential 
election results were the product of wide-
spread fraud and should not be accepted by 
the American people or certified by State or 
Federal officials. Shortly before the Joint 
Session commenced, President Trump, ad-
dressed a crowd at the Ellipse in Wash-
ington, DC. There, he reiterated false claims 
that ‘‘we won this election, and we won it by 
a landslide’’. He also willfully made state-
ments that, in context, encouraged—and 
foreseeably resulted in—lawless action at the 
Capitol, such as: ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell 
you’re not going to have a country any-
more’’. Thus incited by President Trump, 
members of the crowd he had addressed, in 
an attempt to, among other objectives, 
interfere with the Joint Session’s solemn 
constitutional duty to certify the results of 
the 2020 Presidential election, unlawfully 
breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured 
and killed law enforcement personnel, men-
aced Members of Congress, the Vice Presi-
dent, and Congressional personnel, and en-
gaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, 
and seditious acts. 
President Trump’s conduct on January 6, 
2021, followed his prior efforts to subvert and 
obstruct the certification of the results of 
the 2020 Presidential election. Those prior ef-
forts included a phone call on January 2, 
2021, during which President Trump urged 
the secretary of state of Georgia, Brad 
Raffensperger, to ‘‘find’’ enough votes to 
overturn the Georgia Presidential election 
results 
and 
threatened 
Secretary 
Raffensperger if he failed to do so. 
In all this, President Trump gravely en-
dangered the security of the United States 
and its institutions of Government. He 
threatened the integrity of the democratic 
system, interfered with the peaceful transi-
tion of power, and imperiled a coequal 
branch of Government. He thereby betrayed 
his trust as President, to the manifest injury 
of the people of the United States. 
Wherefore, Donald John Trump, by such 
conduct, has demonstrated that he will re-
main a threat to national security, democ-
racy, and the Constitution if allowed to re-
main in office, and has acted in a manner 
grossly incompatible with self-governance 
and the rule of law. Donald John Trump thus 
warrants impeachment and trial, removal 
from office, and disqualification to hold and 
enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit 
under the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
MCCOLLUM). The resolution shall be de-
batable for 2 hours, equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 1 hour. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and insert extra-
neous material on H. Res. 24. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H166 
January 13, 2021 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, in his annual ad-
dress to our predecessors in Congress in 
1862, President Abraham Lincoln spoke 
of the duty of the patriot in an hour of 
decisive crisis for the American people. 
‘‘Fellow citizens,’’ he said, ‘‘we can-
not escape history. We . . . will be re-
membered in spite of ourselves. No per-
sonal significance or insignificance can 
spare one or another of us. The fiery 
trial through which we pass will light 
us down in honor or dishonor to the 
latest generation. . . . We, even we 
here, hold the power and bear the re-
sponsibility.’’ 
In the Bible, St. Paul wrote, ‘‘Think 
on these things.’’ We must think on 
what Lincoln told us. We, even here, 
even us here, hold the power and bear 
the responsibility. 
We, you and I, hold in trust the 
power that derives most directly from 
the people of the United States, and we 
bear the responsibility to fulfill the 
oath that we all swear before God and 
before one another: the oath to defend 
the Constitution against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic, so help us God. 
We know that we face enemies to 
that Constitution. We know. We experi-
enced the insurrection that violated 
the sanctity of the people’s Capitol and 
attempted to overturn the duly re-
corded will of the American people. 
And we know that the President of the 
United States incited this insurrection, 
this armed rebellion against our com-
mon country. He must go. He is a clear 
and present danger to the Nation that 
we all love. 
Since the Presidential election in No-
vember, an election the President lost, 
he has repeatedly lied about the out-
come, sowed self-serving doubt about 
democracy, 
and 
unconstitutionally 
sought to influence State officials to 
repeal reality. And then came that day 
of fire we all experienced. 
The President must be impeached, 
and I believe the President must be 
convicted by the Senate, a constitu-
tional remedy that will ensure that the 
Republic will be safe from this man 
who is so resolutely determined to tear 
down the things that we hold dear and 
that hold us together. 
It gives me no pleasure to say this. It 
breaks my heart. It should break your 
heart. It should break all of our hearts, 
for your presence in this hallowed 
Chamber is testament to your love for 
our country, for America, and to your 
faith in the work of our Founders to 
create a more perfect Union. 
Those insurrectionists were not pa-
triots. They were not part of a political 
base to be catered to and managed. 
They were domestic terrorists, and jus-
tice must prevail. 
But they did not appear out of a vac-
uum. They were sent here, sent here by 
the President with words such as a cry 
to ‘‘fight like hell.’’ Words matter. 
Truth matters. Accountability mat-
ters. In his public exhortations to 
them, the President saw the insurrec-
tionists not as the foes of freedom, as 
they are, but as the means to a terrible 
goal: the goal of his personally clinging 
to power, the goal of thwarting the will 
of the people, the goal of ending in a 
fiery and bloody clash nearly two and a 
half centuries of our democracy. 
This is not theoretical, and this is 
not motivated by partisanship. I stand 
before you today as an officer of the 
Constitution as Speaker of the House 
of Representatives. I stand before you 
as a wife, a mother, a grandmother, a 
daughter, a daughter whose father 
proudly served in this Congress, Thom-
as D’Alesandro, Jr., from Maryland, 
one of the first Italian Americans to 
serve in the Congress. And I stand here 
before you today as that noblest of 
things: a citizen of the United States of 
America. 
With my voice and my vote, with a 
plea to all of you, Democrats and Re-
publicans, I ask you to search your 
souls and answer these questions: Is 
the President’s war on democracy in 
keeping with the Constitution? Were 
his words and insurrectionary mob a 
high crime and misdemeanor? Do we 
not have the duty to our oath to do all 
we constitutionally can to protect our 
Nation and our democracy from the ap-
petites and ambitions of a man who has 
self-evidently demonstrated that he is 
a vital threat to liberty, to self-govern-
ment, and to the rule of law? 
Our country is divided. We all know 
that. There are lies abroad in the land, 
spread by a desperate President who 
feels his power slipping away. We know 
that, too. But I know this as well: that 
we here in this House have a sacred ob-
ligation to stand for truth, to stand up 
for the Constitution, to stand as guard-
ians of the Republic. 
In a speech he was prepared to give in 
Dallas on Friday, November 22, 1963, 
President John F. Kennedy was to say, 
‘‘We in this country, in this genera-
tion, 
are—by 
destiny 
rather 
than 
choice—the watchmen on the walls of 
world freedom. We ask, therefore, that 
we may be worthy of our power and re-
sponsibility.’’ That we may be worthy. 
President Kennedy was assassinated 
before he could deliver those words to 
the Nation, but they resonate more 
even now, in our time and in this place. 
Let us be worthy of our power and re-
sponsibility, 
that 
what 
Lincoln 
thought of the world’s last best hope, 
the United States of America, may 
long survive. 
My fellow Members, my fellow Amer-
icans, we cannot escape history. Let us 
embrace our duty, fulfill our oath, and 
honor the trust of our Nation. We pray 
that God will continue to bless Amer-
ica. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Nineteen minutes. Nineteen minutes. 
Four years ago on inauguration day, 
January 20, 2017, 19 minutes into Presi-
dent Trump’s administration, at 12:19 
p.m., The Washington Post’s headline 
was ‘‘Campaign to Impeach President 
Trump Has Begun.’’ And now with just 
1 week left, they are still trying. 
In 7 days, there will be a peaceful 
transfer of power, just like there has 
been every other time in our country, 
but Democrats are going to impeach 
President Trump again. This doesn’t 
unite the country. There is no way this 
helps the Nation deal with the tragic 
and terrible events of last week that 
we all condemn. Republicans have been 
consistent. We have condemned all the 
violence all the time. We condemned it 
last summer. We condemned it last 
week. 
We should be focused on bringing the 
Nation together. Instead, Democrats 
are going to impeach the President for 
a second time, 1 week—1 week—before 
he leaves office. Why? Why? 
Politics and the fact that they want 
to cancel the President—the President 
who cut taxes, the President who re-
duced regulations, the President who, 
prior to COVID, had the greatest econ-
omy, lowest unemployment in 50 years, 
the President who got us out of the 
Iran deal, put the Embassy in Jeru-
salem, brought hostages home from 
North Korea, put three great Justices 
on the Supreme Court, gave us a new 
NAFTA agreement, the Abraham Ac-
cords, the COVID vaccine, and who 
built the wall. 
It is about politics. This is about get-
ting 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States. They spied on his campaign be-
fore he was elected. Nineteen minutes 
into his Presidency, they started the 
impeachment push: 3-year Mueller in-
vestigation, 19 lawyers, 40 agents, 500 
witnesses, 2,500 subpoenas, $40 million 
to find nothing—impeachment round 
one, based on an anonymous whistle-
blower with no firsthand knowledge, 
who was biased against the President 
and who worked for Joe Biden. Now it 
is impeachment round two. 
It has always been about getting the 
President, no matter what. It is an ob-
session, an obsession that has now 
broadened. It is not just about im-
peachment anymore. It is about can-
celing, as I have said, canceling the 
President and anyone that disagrees 
with them. The Ayatollah can tweet; 
the President can’t. 
Democrats can object on January 6, 
2017, but Republicans aren’t allowed to 
object on January 6, 2021. Democrats 
say antifa is a myth; Republicans con-
demn all violence all the time. The 
double standard has to stop. 
Frankly, the attack on the First 
Amendment has to stop. Stop and 
think about it. Do you have a func-
tioning First Amendment when the 
cancel culture only allows one side to 
talk? When you can’t even have a de-
bate in this country, this great coun-
try, the greatest country ever? It needs 
to stop because if it continues, if it 
continues, it won’t just be Republicans 
who get canceled; it won’t just be the

President of the United States. The 
cancel culture will come for us all. 
America is a great country, the 
greatest country ever. It seems to me 
that we need to think about how great 
the people of this Nation really are, 
think about what we have accom-
plished in the past, and begin to come 
together as leaders who represent so 
many great folks across our districts. 
Think about this. Think about this: 
In 1903, Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, 
two guys fly this thing they called a 
plane 100 feet. Barely got off the 
ground. Barely got off the ground. 
Amazing thing. Forty-four years later, 
Chuck Yeager breaks the sound bar-
rier. In 44 years, we go from two guys 
flying a contraption they called a plane 
a few hundred feet to Chuck Yeager 
breaking the sound barrier, and 22 
years after that—22 years after that— 
another American steps on the Moon. 
Think about it. In one lifetime, in 66 
years, two guys flying 100 feet to put-
ting a man on the Moon. That is what 
this country is capable of. That is what 
we can do. 
We, as the Congress who represents 
the people who did that, should start 
leading, should start understanding 
what really is going on here. So I 
hope—I hope—we defeat this. I hope we 
can begin to come together and recog-
nize the greatness of the American peo-
ple and focus on the things they want 
us to focus on. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 3 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, we all saw it com-
ing. Months in advance, President 
Trump was baselessly and deliberately 
whipping his supporters into a frenzy. 
Weeks before the riot, he used his 
bully pulpit to spread lies about the 
election. He told his supporters that 
the results were fraudulent. He im-
plored them again and again to help 
him stay in power, and he convinced 
them that accepting the outcome of 
the election posed an existential threat 
to their families and their freedoms. 
We have a duty to observe, Madam 
Speaker, that racism played a direct 
role in this incitement. The President’s 
violent rhetoric is always at its most 
fevered pitch when he is talking about 
the civil rights and civic aspirations of 
Black Americans and other minority 
communities. 
On January 6, at a rally that was 
large, angry, and widely reported to be 
armed, the President’s lies and violent 
rhetoric reached their crescendo. At 
that rally, the President took the 
stage. After reiterating the falsehood 
that ‘‘we won this election, and we won 
it by a landslide,’’ he told the crowd 
that ‘‘if you don’t fight like hell, you 
are not going to have a country any-
more.’’ And then he urged the mob to 
‘‘walk down Pennsylvania Avenue’’ to 
prevent the Congress from confirming 
the election of ‘‘an illegitimate Presi-
dent.’’ 
On that day, President Trump un-
leashed the force of a mob on this, the 
people’s House. He encouraged that at-
tack with the explicit intent to disrupt 
the joint session of Congress, an attack 
that threatened the safety of the Vice 
President, the Speaker of the House, 
and the President pro tempore of the 
Senate, the next three officers in the 
line of succession. 
And look at what that violence has 
wrought: at least six dead, offices ran-
sacked, the sanctity of our Capitol 
breached for the first time in two cen-
turies, our hallways littered with bro-
ken glass, the battle flags of a long 
dead Confederacy, and the debris we 
have come to associate with the Trump 
campaign. 
Madam Speaker, I have faith in the 
resiliency of our government. We will 
bring the rioters to justice. Their ac-
complices in this House will be held re-
sponsible. 
But today we must focus on the 
gravest threat first: President Trump, 
who incited this riot and who remains 
a grave danger to the Nation. 
As we warned the Senate when we 
tried him for his first impeachment: 
‘‘President Trump has made clear in 
word and deed that he will persist in 
such conduct if he is not removed from 
power. He poses a continuing threat to 
our Nation, to the integrity of our elec-
tions, and to our democratic order. He 
must not remain in power one moment 
longer.’’ 
Not one moment longer. The danger 
is too great. We must impeach. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
didn’t like the President’s speech on 
January 6 either. I thought he was 
wrong to assert that the Vice President 
and Congress can pick and choose 
which electoral votes to count. He was 
wrong to set such a confrontational 
tone in a politically tense situation. 
But what did he actually say? His 
exact words were: ‘‘I know that every-
one here will soon be marching over to 
the Capitol Building to peacefully and 
patriotically make your voices heard.’’ 
That is impeachable? That is called 
freedom of speech. 
Now, he also threatened to oppose 
candidates in future elections. And, by 
the way, that was directed at Repub-
licans like me who had resolved to up-
hold the constitutional process and 
protect the electoral college. Well, so 
what? That is called politics. 
If we impeached every politician who 
gave a fiery speech to a crowd of par-
tisans, this Capitol would be deserted. 
That is what the President did. That is 
all he did. 
He specifically told the crowd to pro-
test peacefully and patriotically, and 
the vast majority of them did. But 
every movement has a lunatic fringe. 
Suppressing free speech is not the an-
swer. Holding rioters accountable for 
their actions is the answer, and we are. 
If we prosecuted BLM and antifa riot-
ers across the country with the same 
determination these last 6 months, this 
incident might not have happened at 
all. 
Now, short of declaring war, the 
power of impeachment is the most sol-
emn and consequential act that Con-
gress can take. To use it in this man-
ner, in the heat of the moment, with no 
hearings, no due process, many Mem-
bers phoning in their votes after a 
hastily called debate, exactly 1 week 
before a new President is to take office, 
trivializes this power to the point of 
caricature. 
The Democrats have won everything 
in sight—the House, the Senate, and 
the Presidency. In a republic, that calls 
for magnanimity by the victors. Only 
in a banana republic does it call for 
vengeance. 
Benjamin Franklin warned us that 
‘‘passion governs, and she never gov-
erns wisely.’’ In our passions this week, 
we have set some dangerous new prece-
dents that will haunt us for years to 
come. Yesterday, we redefined intem-
perate speech as a physical incapacity 
requiring removal from office. Today, 
we define it as a high crime and mis-
demeanor. 
Well, the moment any Member of 
this body gives an impassioned speech 
and the lunatic fringe of their move-
ment takes license from it, be prepared 
to answer to this new precedent that 
we establish today. 
Now, I could cite plenty of provoca-
tive speeches made by Democrats that 
directly preceded violence this sum-
mer, but we have already had enough 
of that. 
After 600,000 Americans had perished 
in the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln ap-
pealed to the better angels of our na-
ture. He said: With malice toward 
none, with charity for all, let us bind 
up the Nation’s wounds. Those words 
were so important to the unity of our 
Nation they are inscribed in marble at 
the Lincoln Memorial. 
I cannot think of a more petty, vin-
dictive, and gratuitous act than to im-
peach an already defeated President a 
week before he is to leave office. Presi-
dent-elect Biden’s promise to heal the 
Nation becomes a hollow mockery in 
the harsh reality of this unconstitu-
tional act. 
God help our country. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
am the only Member of Congress who 
has been involved in all three of the 
last Presidential impeachments. Those 
were long proceedings. 
Today, we don’t need a long inves-
tigation to know the President incited 
right-wing terrorists to attack the 
Congress to try to overturn constitu-
tional government. The actions were in 
public, plain as day. 
His actions are the most serious of-
fense against our Constitution and our 
country. They are impeachable acts.

January 13, 2021 
The Founders devised the Impeach-
ment Clause to protect against a Presi-
dent who would threaten constitu-
tional order. If we don’t act now, the 
Impeachment Clause would essentially 
be meaningless. 
Faced with these facts, if we don’t 
impeach to protect our country, we 
will fail our own oath to protect and 
defend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and, 
yes, domestic. 
We have no choice. We must impeach. 
God bless America. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, it is 
with wariness and a certain unhealthy, 
morbid curiosity that I watch the beast 
attempt to devour President Donald J. 
Trump again. The craving to crush 
President Trump has never been satis-
fied—not through investigations, not 
through false allegations, and not even 
through an impeachment that was 
wholly without merit. 
And the timing of this impeachment 
makes little sense. Your candidate will 
take office in a few hours, and Presi-
dent Trump will relinquish the levers 
of power to President-elect Biden. 
Your craving was never a Biden vic-
tory, nor was it even a Trump defeat. 
You believe that your hunger will be fi-
nally satiated by impeaching this 
President without completion of his 
full term of office. You don’t merely 
seek victory, but you seek obliteration 
of your nemesis. 
The thirst for Trump’s destruction 
will not be slaked, however, even if you 
are successful today and were the Sen-
ate to convict President Trump. Yours 
will be a Pyrrhic victory, for, instead 
of stopping the Trump train, his move-
ment will grow stronger, for you will 
have made him a martyr. 
Surely you are aware of this, and 
that is why your allies in the media 
seek to censor conservative voices. 
Your chums who sit on the boards of 
corporate America—yes, the same com-
panies that the left vilifies—promise to 
starve 
Republicans 
from 
receiving 
their PAC donations. 
But I bet that the groundswell of sup-
port for President Trump and his poli-
cies will not go away. You see, the 
movement he started is based on build-
ing an incredibly robust economy on a 
foundation of lower taxes and fewer 
regulations that has the wonderful ef-
fect of putting more people to work 
than ever. It is built upon a strong 
military that is extricated from end-
less wars. It provides border security, 
America-first trade agreements, Mid-
east peace and stability. Those are the 
things the American people want. 
Your 4-year appetite will be tempo-
rarily assuaged while you will, no 
doubt, continue to chase after leaders 
of this movement, but your appetite 
will be unfulfilled. 
I urge you, please, do not—and I am 
mixing metaphors here—attempt to 
douse the remaining burning embers of 
this movement with gasoline. No one 
wants that. I urge you, please, to re-
consider the reckless action in which 
you engage today. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. SCHIFF). 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, 1 week 
ago, the President incited an insurrec-
tion against Congress to prevent the 
peaceful transition of power. It was the 
most dangerous moment for our de-
mocracy in a century. 
Today, we invoke the remedy the 
Founders provided for just such a law-
less President: impeachment. 
More important, today, we begin the 
long road to restoration. America has 
been through a civil war, world wars, a 
Great Depression, pandemics, McCar-
thyism, and now a Trumpist and white 
nationalist insurrection. And yet our 
democracy endures. It endures because, 
at every juncture, every pivotal mo-
ment when evil threatened to overtake 
good, patriotic Americans stepped for-
ward to say, ‘‘Enough.’’ 
This is one of those moments. To pre-
serve this sacred place, this citadel of 
democracy, for ourselves and for pos-
terity, let us say, ‘‘Enough.’’ Enough. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. 
GOHMERT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
here is a quote: ‘‘I just don’t even know 
why there aren’t uprisings all over the 
country. And maybe there will be.’’ 
Or, ‘‘Sadly, the domestic enemies of 
our voting system and honoring our 
Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsyl-
vania Avenue with their allies in Con-
gress of the United States.’’ We were 
called enemies of the state. 
Those are all quotes from our Speak-
er. 
Now, on our side, we didn’t take 
those to be impeachable because we 
didn’t believe she surely meant that. 
By the Democrats taking this action, 
you are telling me, no, when we say 
those words, we actually mean to in-
cite violence. That is what this action 
is saying. 
Look, I just looked on the History 
Channel. It says these words: ‘‘If the 
Judiciary Committee,’’ talking about 
impeachment, 
‘‘finds 
sufficient 
grounds, its members write and pass 
Articles of Impeachment, which then 
go to the full House for a vote.’’ 
Half of all of the impeachments ever 
conducted, ever voted for, occurred 
under this Speaker. You are setting a 
precedent that says very clearly—be-
cause this impeachment isn’t going to 
work, but it is setting the precedent. 
Unlike a year ago, when we said, 
look, it shouldn’t go through the Intel-
ligence 
Committee, 
it 
should 
go 
through the Judiciary Committee, for-
get that. Now the message is: If you 
have a whim and you want to just go 
after a President, just go straight to 
the floor—no investigation, no Judici-
ary Committee. Go straight to the 
floor. Use it as a political weapon as 
you wish. 
This is so dangerous, what you are 
doing, forgetting all the precedents. 
Yes, we can argue back and forth, but 
you are using this as a weapon, and you 
are destroying this little experiment in 
self-government in a year’s time. It 
needs to stop. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK). 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, suffragist and aboli-
tionist Lucy Stone stated, ‘‘If we speak 
the truth fearlessly, we shall add to 
our number those who will turn the 
scale to the side of equal and full jus-
tice in all things.’’ 
The truth is, President Trump in-
cited a violent attack against the 
United States Government. 
The truth is, President Trump spent 
his Presidency inflaming hate, white 
supremacy, anti-Semitism, and vio-
lence. 
The truth is, he was enabled by all 
those who perpetuated the lie that the 
most secure election in our Nation’s 
history was stolen. 
The truth is that these seditious ac-
tions left five dead, our Capitol be-
sieged, our security threatened, and 
our democracy hanging in the balance. 
And the truth is, a vote to impeach is 
our resounding declaration that the 
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, for the people shall not perish. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, the last 
speaker said that for 4 years the Presi-
dent did all these terrible, inciteful 
things, including anti-Semitism. I take 
exception with that. 
But I think it is important that we 
embrace one thing that was said. Yes, 
the President has been consistent for 
the last 4 years. During his campaign, 
I even, while representing another can-
didate, said that the President had po-
litical Tourette’s; he said what was on 
his mind without a filter. 
I don’t think that is being debated 
here today. We all know that is true. 
What is being debated is whether, with 
167 hours left until he leaves office, he 
is a clear and present danger. He clear-
ly isn’t. 
The President has acted substan-
tially the same for 4 years. He has ral-
lied his base, and he has, in fact, called 
for peaceful protest, as he did just a 
few days ago. 
The fact is, today, we are trying to 
punish the President—at least some 
are—for 4 years of what he did, not for 
what happened last week. What hap-
pened last week was the result of anar-
chists who came loaded, prepared, and 
with weapons.

this body to do what I was sworn to do 
on the first date: To protect and defend 
the Constitution. 
President Trump put the domestic 
terrorists on notice by saying, ‘‘Stand 
back and stand by.’’ He then sum-
moned them to D.C., directed them to 
march on the Capitol, and then he sat 
back and watched the insurrection. 
Some of my colleagues—some of 
which may well be coconspirators—in 
their latest attempt to placate and 
please this unfit President, suggests 
that we shouldn’t punish Trump for his 
actions in order to unify the country. 
That is the climax of foolishness. 
Let me suggest to them: Stand up. 
Man up. Woman up. And defend this 
Constitution from all enemies, foreign 
and domestic, including Donald J. 
Trump. 
In the first impeachment, Repub-
licans said we didn’t need to impeach 
him because he learned his lesson, so 
no need to remove him. 
Well, we said, if we didn’t remove 
him, he would do it again. Simply put, 
we told you so. 
Richmond out. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the resolution. At a 
time when our country needs unity, it 
is concerning that my Democratic col-
leagues have chosen to begin impeach-
ment proceedings against a President 
with just 7 days left in office. All legal 
challenges have been exhausted. Con-
gress has certified electors over objec-
tors, and Joe Biden will be the next 
President of the United States. 
President Trump has indicated he 
will peacefully transfer power to Presi-
dent-elect Biden next week. 
So why pursue impeachment just 1 
week before he leaves office? 
I have heard my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle say they have to 
impeach the President because he is 
too dangerous to stay in power, yet 
they know that it is impossible for the 
Senate to remove him before his term 
expires. 
So what is the point? 
Madam Speaker, this move sets a 
dangerous precedent for our Nation. If 
Congress is going to impeach a Presi-
dent, it must only be done after intense 
debate and deliberation, not rushed 
through in the 11th hour to make a po-
litical point. This impeachment at-
tempt is dangerous for our country and 
has far-reaching implications for our 
future. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
JEFFRIES). 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
did not come to Congress to impeach 
Donald Trump, but the constitutional 
crimes by an out-of-control President 
inspired by his hatred and the big lie 
that he told cannot be ignored. Donald 
Trump is a living, breathing, impeach-
able offense. It is what it is. 
The violent attack on the U.S. Cap-
itol was an act of insurrection incited 
by Donald Trump. He is a clear and 
present danger to the health, safety, 
and well-being of the American people. 
That is why this impeachment is nec-
essary on the House floor for a second 
time with a bipartisan majority. 
Violence will not win. Insurrection 
will not win. Sedition will not win. 
Terror will not win. Lawlessness will 
not win. Mob rule will not win. Not 
today, not tomorrow, not ever. 
Democracy will prevail. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
AGUILAR). 
Mr. AGUILAR. Madam Speaker, on 
January 3, we stood here on this floor 
and swore an oath to defend our Con-
stitution against enemies, foreign and 
domestic. Three days later, that oath 
was put to the test when a violent mob 
tried to break down those doors to stop 
us from performing our constitutional 
duty. This mob was not without a lead-
er. 
On that day, the President told them 
to walk to this Capitol, 16 blocks from 
where he stood. They were radicalized 
by his lies and conspiracy theories he 
spent months fueling, many of which I 
have heard on this floor the last week. 
He needed to say only two words to end 
the violence: ‘‘I concede.’’ Because that 
is what leaders do in a democracy. Be-
cause that is what we do in the United 
States. They put politics aside and put 
country first. 
Madam Speaker, as I look to our col-
leagues over on the other side, I won-
der how many of them will dem-
onstrate that leadership and join us in 
holding President Trump accountable 
for inciting this deadly attack, and I 
wonder how many will uphold our oath 
and put our country first to defend this 
Constitution from the threat in the 
White House. To do anything less, is to 
turn your back on the oath altogether. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, for 
more than 220 years since George 
Washington yielded the Presidency to 
John Adams, the peaceful transfer of 
power has been a hallmark of our de-
mocracy. 
In this country, the will of the Amer-
ican people reigns supreme over the 
ambitions of any individual. Every sin-
gle President has honored and upheld 
these principles until now. 
Donald Trump lost his bid for reelec-
tion last November. It was a free and 
fair 
election. 
In 
fact, 
President 
Trump’s own election security director 
called it ‘‘the most secure election in 
U.S. history.’’ But for 2 months now, 
Donald Trump has refused to accept 
the will of the American people. Over 
and over again, he has told his sup-
porters he didn’t really lose; the elec-
tion was stolen from him and from 
them. And as they grew angrier and 
angrier over this perceived injustice, 
he told them there was still a way to 
keep him in power. 
As Congress prepared to meet for the 
sacred ritual of certifying the results 
of the President’s election, the Presi-
dent made his move. He directed his 
supporters to travel to Washington for 
a rally to ‘‘stop the steal.’’ 
They did. 
Then, once assembled, he had one 
final request: March on the U.S. Cap-
itol. Do what it takes to help me hold 
on to power. ‘‘We will never give up. 
We will never concede,’’ he told them. 
‘‘If you don’t fight like hell,’’ he 
warned, ‘‘you are not going to have a 
country anymore.’’ 
The people on the Ellipse that day 
heard his message loud and clear. They 
answered his call for insurrection. 
As the third-ranking Republican in 
this Chamber put it, he ‘‘summoned 
the mob, assembled the mob, and lit 
the flame of this attack.’’ 
Armed with guns, pipe bombs, bats, 
shields, zip ties, and more, they set 
their sights on the U.S. Capitol. They 
stormed the citadel of our democracy. 
Hundreds of domestic terrorists did 
what Donald Trump wanted them to 
do. They seized the Capitol and tried to 
end our country’s 234-year experiment 
in democracy, as the Trump family and 
White House aides watched gleefully on 
television. 
They searched the Halls of this build-
ing for the Vice President, who they 
came to hang for treason. They overran 
the Office of the Speaker, who they 
came to assassinate. They sought, 
above all else, to seize control of our 
government in the name of Donald 
Trump. 
Let that sink in: The terrorists who 
stormed this building planned to hang 
the Vice President, kill the Speaker, 
and topple our government. 
They took down the American flag 
and replaced it with a Trump flag. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle who are 
not planning to vote for this article: Is 
this the kind of country you want to 
live in? What are you going to tell your 
children and grandchildren when they 
ask what you did in this moment? Did 
you stand for the Republic or for this 
President? 
Heed the words of Abraham Lincoln, 
the first Republican President, who 
told our country that ‘‘a house divided 
against itself cannot stand.’’ 
This great House of which Abraham 
Lincoln served cannot and will not en-
dure if we do not stand together now. 
The President and the terrorists who 
stormed these Halls last Wednesday did 
not succeed in toppling our Republic. 
We must ensure they never do. I im-
plore you to join us in supporting this 
article. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW).

January 13, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, we 
have been here before. We have done 
this before. This has failed before. We 
fractured our Nation using the same 
process before. Congress must be the 
glue that starts unifying everyone. 
By the time this process would con-
clude, the man they want out of office 
will no longer even be the President. If 
we want unity, this is not the way. 
America was and is the leading light 
in the world. This proceeding has con-
tinued to cloak our Nation in darkness. 
Nearly half the country supports our 
current President. This takes their 
voice away. We must be bigger and bet-
ter than the most base of instincts that 
have been driving our political dis-
course. It is destroying us. Let’s link 
arms with one another and begin to 
heal. Let’s stop this impeachment. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mr. 
NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
President Trump’s actions—encour-
aging, inciting a mob that stormed the 
United States Capitol for the sole pur-
pose of stopping the constitutionally 
mandated counting of electoral votes— 
cannot go unanswered by this body. He 
must be impeached. 
If Congress does not act, if we shrink 
from our constitutional responsibil-
ities to defend our Republic, it will un-
doubtedly undermine the vision of 
America as ‘‘the last best hope of 
earth,’’ as Abraham Lincoln so elo-
quently said so many years ago. 
To the millions of Americans watch-
ing today: I hope that you understand 
that we are proceeding on this path out 
of love for our country. 
I will honor my oath today. I will 
vote for impeachment, and I pray that 
my colleagues will muster the courage 
to do the same. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN). 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
the Article of Impeachment. 
Last Wednesday, we gathered to fol-
low the Constitution’s simple instruc-
tion: To count the electoral votes that 
have been tallied by the States and 
submitted to us. 
This President refused to accept 
those results. Instead, he sought to 
overturn them by inciting a violent in-
surrection. But we were not deterred 
from doing our constitutional duty. 
Today, we must do our constitutional 
duty once again. 
While the President failed in his at-
tempt to upend our democracy, last 
Wednesday’s events declared that if we 
do not hold him accountable and re-
move him from power, a future at-
tempt could very well be successful. 
The survival of our democracy de-
pends on defeated candidates accepting 
their defeats, as has been the case in 
every President’s election since 1864. 
Our January 6 joint session is a vital 
part of the transfer of power, not the 
contest for power. Vice President Gore 
understood this, accepting and certi-
fying the 2000 election result in which 
he was defeated. Vice President Biden 
understood this, accepting and certi-
fying this President’s victory in the 
2016 election. 
This President’s refusal to partici-
pate in the peaceful transfer of power 
and his role in the incitement of last 
week’s violence posed an existential 
threat to our constitution of democ-
racy. 
This threat must be extinguished im-
mediately. This President must be im-
peached and convicted, and he must be 
prevented from ever attempting to 
seize power again. 
b 1315 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. BUCK). 
Mr. BUCK. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I have heard that 
President Trump radicalized the group 
of the rioters who stormed this Capitol. 
I would say that we need to look no 
further than ourselves to find out what 
happened and to look at history. 
Americans were frustrated when they 
learned that the FBI was investigating 
the Trump campaign. They were frus-
trated to learn that the Obama admin-
istration and the DNC had created this 
false campaign against the Trump ad-
ministration. They were frustrated, 
Madam Speaker, when the inaugura-
tion of the President was boycotted by 
over 40 Democrat Members of this 
House. 
They were frustrated to read in The 
Washington Post the day after the in-
auguration: 
Let 
the 
impeachment 
begin. 
They were frustrated when Members 
of this House spoke over and over 
about impeaching the President days 
into his administration. And then the 
Socialists in Hollywood joined their al-
lies in Congress. Robert De Niro said 
that he wanted to punch the President 
in the face. Madonna thought about 
blowing up the White House. Kathy Lee 
Griffin held up a likeness of the Presi-
dent’s beheaded head, and nothing was 
said by my colleagues at that point in 
time. 
In fact, one Democrat colleague said 
that Trump supporters should be har-
assed 
wherever 
they 
are, 
in 
res-
taurants, on the street, and in super-
markets. 
During this time, the President was 
under investigation by a special coun-
sel who found no collusion and no con-
spiracy with Russia. 
The President’s supporters were har-
assed. Ajit Pai, the head of the FCC, 
was called a dirty, sneaky Indian. His 
children were harassed in school. The 
press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was 
kicked out of a restaurant for being a 
Trump employee. The DHS Secretary, 
Kirstjen Nielsen, was harassed by her 
home, and Trump donors were publicly 
shamed. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
RASKIN). 
Mr. 
RASKIN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
smashing windows and beating police 
officers over the head with fire extin-
guishers, a bloodthirsty mob attacked 
the Capitol and invaded this Congress 
last Wednesday. They erected a gallows 
and repeatedly chanted: Hang Mike 
Pence. 
They stormed Speaker PELOSI’s office 
yelling: Where is Nancy? 
They brandished the Confederate bat-
tle flag and occupied the Senate Cham-
ber. They wounded dozens of people, 
hospitalized 
dozens 
of 
people, 
and 
killed five of our people. For 6 hours, 
they shut down the counting of elec-
toral college votes—our sacred process 
under the Constitution for peaceful 
transfer of power in the United States. 
They may have been hunting for 
PENCE and PELOSI to stage their coup, 
but every one of us in this room right 
now could have died. As Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM said: The mob could 
have blown the building up. They could 
have killed us all. 
And now the far right is calling for a 
return engagement from January 17 to 
January 20. They are asking the Presi-
dent to pardon the conspirators in last 
week’s rampage as they prepare for a 
race war again next week. It is a bit 
much to be hearing that these people 
would not be trying to destroy our gov-
ernment and kill us if we just weren’t 
so mean to them. 
Despite the floor leader’s desperate 
effort to polarize this body and this Na-
tion along party lines, it is the chair of 
the Republican Conference who best ar-
ticulated what happened in a state-
ment yesterday, and I recommend 
every American read this. LIZ CHENEY 
of Wyoming, the elected chair of the 
Republican 
Conference, 
wrote 
that 
‘‘the President summoned this mob, as-
sembled this mob, and lit the flame of 
this attack. Everything that followed 
was his doing. None of this would have 
happened without the President. The 
President could have immediately and 
forcibly intervened to stop the vio-
lence. He did not. There has never been 
a greater betrayal by a President of the 
United States.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Maryland an 
additional 10 seconds. 
Mr. RASKIN. Ms. CHENEY says that 
‘‘there has never been a greater be-
trayal by a President of the United 
States of his office and his oath to the 
Constitution.’’ 
Read Ms. CHENEY’s statement. Let’s 
come together and impeach the Presi-
dent for this high crime against the 
Republic. We don’t have a minute to 
spare. He is a clear and present danger 
to the people.

January 13, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. GAETZ). 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, it 
seems to me that impeachment is an 
itch that doesn’t go away with just one 
scratch. It also seems that President 
Trump may be most likely to be im-
peached when he is correct. 
Before the last Presidential impeach-
ment, President Trump rightly pointed 
out the improper activities of the 
Biden crime family, and subsequently 
he has been proven right. And don’t 
think for a moment, Madam Speaker, 
that we are going to drop that or stop 
our pursuit for the truth. 
Before that, Madam Speaker, we had 
the Russia hoax, where you had the 
President rightfully making claims 
that Hillary Clinton and the DNC were 
colluding with Russians to disorient 
our democracy. How right he turned 
out to be. 
And then we have the 2020 Presi-
dential election where the President 
correctly pointed out unconstitutional 
behavior, voting irregularities, con-
cerns over tabulations, dead people 
voting, and now impeachment again. 
‘‘When they go low, we kick them,’’ 
Eric Holder, former Attorney General 
under Barack Obama. 
Breaching the Capitol was as low as 
low can be. We all denounce it. 
But who is it that they are kicking? 
The President, who created soaring 
highs for our economy, rising wages be-
fore the pandemic, and 400 miles of wall 
to stop the caravans. He drew down 
troops in the Middle East and showed 
empathy for the forgotten men and 
women of our country. It is why so 
many people love him so much, and it 
is why they are kicking all of us. 
This President has faced unprece-
dented hatred and resistance from Big 
Media, Big Tech, and big egos from 
congressional leaders on both sides of 
the aisle. 
Before the rioters tore through that 
glass, Speaker PELOSI stood at that 
rostrum and tore through the Presi-
dent’s State of the Union speech, incit-
ing anger, resentment, and division. 
Some believe that truly these true col-
ors are being shown now through this 
divisive bipartisan impeachment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Florida an 
additional 40 seconds. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, the 
Speaker said to us just moments ago 
that words matter. But apparently 
those words don’t matter when they 
are uttered by Democrats, when the 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts calls 
for unrest in the streets, and when the 
gentlewoman from California brazenly 
brags that she called for people to get 
in the faces of those who serve and sup-
port the President. 
I denounce political violence from all 
ends of the spectrum. But make no 
mistake: the left in America has in-
cited far more political violence than 
the 
right. 
For 
months 
our 
cities 
burned, police stations burned, and our 
businesses were shattered; and they 
said nothing or they cheer-led for it, 
they fundraised for it, and they allowed 
it to happen in the greatest country in 
the world. 
Now, some have cited the metaphor 
that the President lit the flame. They 
lit actual flames and actual fires. We 
put them out, and we intend to keep 
this President. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
SWALWELL). 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, 
America has been attacked before, but 
not like this. On January 6, Donald 
Trump incited thousands of radicalized 
terrorists to attack the Capitol to stop 
a transition of power. Let that sink in. 
Our President incited our citizens to 
attack our Capitol. America was not 
attacked in the past tense. This Presi-
dent has inspired future plots. America 
is still under attack, and that is why 
Donald Trump must be impeached. 
I have read that many of my GOP 
colleagues know what the President 
did was wrong but are afraid for their 
lives if they cross the President. I am 
sorry that they are living in fear, but 
now is the time to summon their cour-
age to guide them. 
Madam Speaker, we have all seen the 
images of the courageous officers who 
have risked their lives so that you 
could flee this floor and see your fami-
lies. That was almost a week ago right 
now. 
Officers 
engaged 
in 
hand-to-hand 
combat for hours with these terrorists. 
Capitol Police were spit on, beaten, 
stampeded, and one of them lost his 
life. 
Madam Speaker, I am not asking you 
to summon the courage that they did; 
I am just asking you to do your job and 
hold this President accountable. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CASTRO). 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, Donald Trump is the most 
dangerous man to ever occupy the Oval 
Office. 
Madam Speaker, I want to take you 
back 1 week ago today when people 
were barging through these doors and 
breaking the windows with weapons, 
armed, pipe bombs, coming here to 
harm all of you, to harm the Speaker, 
and to harm the Senate. 
Madam Speaker, let me ask you a 
question: What do you think they 
would have done if they had gotten in? 
What do you think they would have 
done to you, and who do you think sent 
them here? The most dangerous man to 
ever occupy the Oval Office. 
If inciting a deadly insurrection is 
not enough to get a President im-
peached, then what is? 
All of us must answer that question 
today. 
The Constitution requires us to im-
peach and remove Donald John Trump. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, 1 week 
ago today, I was trapped in this House 
Chamber as the banging on the doors 
began. I feared for colleagues, report-
ers, and staff. I feared for myself. The 
attack on the Capitol will never be for-
gotten. 
The President and many in this 
Chamber 
have 
shamelessly 
peddled 
dangerous untruths about the election, 
despite the warnings of where those 
lies would lead. Last Wednesday, those 
lies and dangers found themselves in-
side this Capitol. 
This hateful rhetoric is another dead-
ly virus. It is time to remove it from 
its host. To heal, we need account-
ability and truth. That begins by ac-
knowledging the President’s dangerous 
lies and their deadly consequences. Re-
moving Donald Trump is the beginning 
of restoring decency and democracy. 
What happened last week will not be 
forgotten, and what we do this week 
will long be remembered. Vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on impeachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY). 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, let me be clear: 
Last week’s violent attack on the Cap-
itol was undemocratic, un-American, 
and criminal. Violence is never a le-
gitimate form of protest. Freedom of 
speech and assembly under the Con-
stitution is rooted in nonviolence. Yet 
the violent mob that descended upon 
this body was neither peaceful nor 
democratic. It acted to disrupt Con-
gress’ constitutional responsibility. It 
was also an attack on the people who 
work in this institution: Members, 
staff, and the hundreds who work be-
hind the scenes so that we can serve 
the American people. 
The greatest statesman in the his-
tory of our country understood that 
the most dangerous threat to freedom 
is lawlessness. A young lawyer named 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
famously 
said, 
‘‘There is no grievance that is a fit ob-
ject of redress by mob law.’’ 
Yet, for several hours last week, mob 
law tried to interfere with constitu-
tional law. 
Some say the riots were caused by 
antifa. There is absolutely no evidence 
of that, and Conservatives should be 
the first to say so. 
Conservatives also know that the 
only thing that stops mob violence is 
to meet it with force rooted in justice 
and backed by moral courage. Last 
week, we saw mob violence met by 
courage, sacrifice, and heroism from 
the brave men and women who protect 
this institution every day. But for the 
bravery of the Capitol Police, the de-
struction and loss could have been

much greater. We owe them a tremen-
dous debt of gratitude. 
b 1330 
The loss of Officer Brian Sicknick 
and Officer Howard Liebengood was 
tragic and heartbreaking. We mourn 
their loss, remember their lives, and 
continue to pray for their families and 
loved ones. 
The officers of the Capitol Police de-
serve our eternal thanks. We will never 
forget the dangers they faced, the de-
termination they showed, or the sac-
rifices they made. 
Make no mistake, those who are re-
sponsible for Wednesday’s chaos will be 
brought to justice, which brings me to 
today’s debate. I believe impeaching 
the President in such a short time-
frame would be a mistake. 
No investigations have been com-
pleted. No hearings have been held. 
What is more, the Senate has con-
firmed that no trial will begin until 
after President-elect Biden is sworn in. 
But here is what a vote to impeach 
would do. A vote to impeach would fur-
ther divide this Nation. A vote to im-
peach will further fan the flames of 
partisan division. 
Most Americans want neither inac-
tion nor retribution. They want dura-
ble, bipartisan justice. That path is 
still available, but it is not the path we 
are on today. 
That doesn’t mean the President is 
free from fault. The President bears re-
sponsibility for Wednesday’s attack on 
Congress by mob rioters. He should 
have immediately denounced the mob 
when he saw what was unfolding. 
These facts require immediate action 
by President Trump: accept his share 
of responsibility, quell the brewing un-
rest, and ensure President-elect Biden 
is able to successfully begin his term. 
And the President’s immediate ac-
tion also deserves congressional action, 
which is why I think a factfinding com-
mission and a censure resolution would 
be prudent. Unfortunately, that is not 
where we are today. 
Truly, this past week was one of the 
most difficult for Congress and our Na-
tion. Of all the days here, last Wednes-
day was the worst day I have ever seen 
in Congress. Our country is deeply 
hurt. 
So, where do we go from here? After 
all the violence and chaos of the last 
week, it is important to remember that 
we are still here to deliver a better fu-
ture for all Americans. It does not mat-
ter if you are liberal, moderate, or con-
servative; all of us must resist the 
temptations of further polarization. In-
stead, we must unite once again as 
Americans. 
I understand, for some, this call for 
unity may ring hollow, but times like 
these are when we must remember who 
we are as Americans and what we, as a 
nation, stand for. 
As history shows, unity is not an op-
tion; it is a necessity. It is as necessary 
today as it was at the start of our 
country. I want us all to think back to 
how John Adams and the Federalist 
Party handed power over to Thomas 
Jefferson and his party after the elec-
tion of 1800. 
That election and, indeed, that era 
was one of the most divisive ever. Par-
tisans used every dirty trick in the 
book. They demonized each other, dis-
missed reasonable dissent, and de-
scribed their opponents as seditious. 
Sound familiar? 
The election of 1800 could have de-
stroyed our young Nation, but instead 
of breaking us, it helped bring us to-
gether, thereby preserving the world’s 
last best hope of freedom. After a hard- 
fought battle over the electoral college 
in Congress, Adams conceded. A peace-
ful transfer of power, the first in Amer-
ican history, took place. 
Jefferson, for his part, put aside the 
division of the era and preached for-
giveness and, yes, unity. In his first in-
augural address, he famously said: 
‘‘Every difference of opinion is not a 
difference of principle.’’ 
Jefferson and Adams did not end 
every difference of opinion that existed 
in America, nor did they try. In a free 
country as big and diverse as ours, that 
would be impossible. What they did was 
more important. They recognized the 
deeper unity, a unity rooted in the fa-
mous proposition both men helped to 
write. At a critical moment in history, 
our Founders chose peace, liberty, and 
partnership over tension, division, and 
partisanship. 
For the sake of our country, we must 
make the exact same choice. We have 
already begun. 
Last week, despite the lingering 
shock and amid the windows still bro-
ken, we did what all healthy democ-
racies do. We debated, and we voted. In 
this country, we solve our disputes at 
the ballot box and through debates and 
votes on the floor of this exact Cham-
ber. We did our duty then, and we must 
do more. 
The eyes of the Nation and the world 
are upon us. We must seize this oppor-
tunity and heal and grow stronger. As 
leaders, our place in history depends on 
whether we call on our better angels 
and refocus our efforts to work directly 
for the American people. 
United, we can deliver the peace, 
strength, and prosperity our country 
desperately needs. Divided, we will fail. 
What we saw last week was not the 
American way. Neither is the contin-
ued rhetoric that Joe Biden is not the 
legitimate President. 
Let’s be clear: Joe Biden will be 
sworn in as President of the United 
States in 1 week because he won the 
election. 
And his Presidency and this Congress 
will face immediate challenges that 
must be addressed. I stand ready to as-
sist in that effort with good faith, 
goodwill, and an open hand. 
The United States remains excep-
tional. We remain extraordinary. In 
the coming weeks and months, we 
must work together, all of us, to re-
charge the light of our shining city on 
the hill. 
History has shown us a way. History 
has given us a path. Just as Adams and 
Jefferson have shown, now is the mo-
ment that we should do the exact 
same. 
In these trying times, may God con-
tinue to bless America. Let’s chart a 
course that history will repeat but not 
what is happening today. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Ms. 
DEGETTE). 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, just 
over a year ago, I stood right there 
where you are standing today as we 
took the solemn step of impeaching the 
President of the United States for pres-
suring a foreign leader to take unlaw-
ful actions to help him in his reelec-
tion. 
Just 1 week ago, almost to the hour, 
I laid right there on the floor of the 
gallery above us. I heard gunshots in 
the Speaker’s lobby. I heard the mob 
pounding on the door. They were an 
angry mob, incited by the President, 
trying to stop certification of a legiti-
mate election. 
It is clear the President learned 
nothing in the last year. Yesterday, 
the President said again he did nothing 
wrong. 
This man is dangerous. He has defied 
the Constitution. He has incited sedi-
tion. And he must be removed. 
We all took a pledge on January 3 to 
uphold the Constitution. We must 
honor that oath. We must vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this Article of Impeachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Glory to God. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to op-
pose this impeachment and denounce 
the recent violence on the Capitol, just 
as I opposed the previous impeachment 
and the violence we have all witnessed 
all summer long across our great coun-
try. 
Make no mistake here, the hypocrisy 
of the left is on full display. 
Go to the Hill. Get in the face of some 
Congresspeople. We have got to fight in Con-
gress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets. 
Take him behind the gym and beat the hell 
out of him. Go and take Trump out tonight. 
Sound familiar? What about the gen-
tlewoman from New York who defended 
the looting by saying looters just want 
loaves of bread? The last I checked, 
Best Buy and Tesla and stores of the 
like do not produce baked goods. 
Where is the accountability for the 
left after encouraging and normalizing 
violence? Rather than actually helping 
American people in this time, we start 
impeachments that further divide our 
country. 
I call bull crap when I hear the 
Democrats demanding unity. Sadly, 
they are only unified in hate. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California

January 13, 2021 
worst President in the history of the 
United States. 
Since his first day in office, this 
President has spent 4 years abusing his 
power, 
lying, 
embracing 
authoritarianism, and radicalizing his 
supporters against democracy. 
This corruption poisoned the minds 
of his supporters, inciting them to will-
ingly join with white supremacists, 
neo-Nazis, and paramilitary extremists 
in a siege of the United States Capitol 
Building, the very seat of American de-
mocracy. 
The Republican Party is now the 
Trump party. And I want you to know 
that this is a Trump power grab that 
will not stop. It will not stop with at-
tacking the Capitol and our State leg-
islatures. This President intends to ex-
ercise power long after he is out of of-
fice. 
It is reported that the President of 
the United States watched the invasion 
of our Capitol from the Oval Office and 
seemingly enjoyed it. I want you to 
know we should be concerned that the 
Republicans will defend him, and he is 
capable of starting a civil war. 
He must be impeached. He must be 
stopped now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, this is a sad day in 
our Republic, but not as sad or dis-
heartening as the violence we wit-
nessed in the Capitol last Wednesday. 
We are all responsible. My colleagues 
are responsible for not condemning ri-
oters this past year, like those who 
barricaded the doors of the Seattle Po-
lice Department and attempted to mur-
der the officers inside. Others, includ-
ing myself, are responsible for not 
speaking out sooner, before the Presi-
dent misinformed and inflamed a vio-
lent mob who tore down the American 
flag and brutally beat Capitol Police 
officers. 
Madam Speaker, we must all do bet-
ter. These Articles of Impeachment are 
flawed, but I will not use process as an 
excuse. There is no excuse for Presi-
dent Trump’s actions. 
The President took an oath to defend 
the Constitution against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. Last week, there 
was a domestic threat at the door of 
the Capitol, and he did nothing to stop 
it. 
That is why, with a heavy heart and 
clear resolve, I will vote ‘‘yes’’ on these 
Articles of Impeachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, could 
I ask how much time each side has re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 361⁄4 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 363⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS). 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Madam Speaker, 
a mob desecrated our Capitol, killed a 
police officer, and attempted to over-
throw our government on the orders of 
the President of the United States. Im-
mediate impeachment is our duty 
under the Constitution that compels us 
to defend against enemies, foreign and 
domestic. 
As a Marine officer, I defended our 
democracy from foreign enemies. As a 
Member of Congress, I am solemnly re-
solved to defend it from domestic ones. 
With this vote, we strike a blow for 
moral leadership. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
b 1345 
Mr. 
CHABOT. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America is at a crossroads. As the vio-
lent riots at the Capitol last week so 
painfully and shockingly reminded us, 
the unhinged partisan rhetoric that too 
often consumes the political dialogue 
in this country has become toxic and is 
tearing us apart. If we continue down 
this path, there is no telling how much 
damage to our Union there may be. 
Sadly, that is what is happening here 
today. The majority is rushing through 
yet a second impeachment of President 
Trump, who has but 7 days remaining 
in office. As prominent constitutional 
law professor Jonathan Turley has cau-
tioned: Today a dangerous precedent is 
being set that could lead to the nor-
malization of snap impeachments with-
out any hearings or any meaningful 
discussion or debate. 
The majority is ramming through 
this House the most potent tool at our 
disposal without a single hearing, turn-
ing 
a 
process 
that 
usually 
takes 
months into a few short hours. 
We haven’t heard testimony from a 
single witness. We haven’t heard from 
any experts on the nature of these 
charges, nor the damage this effort 
could inflict on our Republic. We didn’t 
know even how this debate would un-
fold until 9 a.m. this morning. 
This is truly an unprecedented situa-
tion and one which could cause irrev-
ocable harm to our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, it doesn’t have to be 
this way. We don’t have to continue 
down this misguided path. We could in-
stead follow the wisdom provided by 
none other than Abraham Lincoln dur-
ing another divisive time in our Na-
tion’s history and listen to the better 
angels of our nature. We could choose a 
more positive, constructive path and 
vote down this ill-conceived effort. 
We should tone down the political 
rhetoric. We should work together to 
solve the problems that face our Na-
tion. We should put aside our dif-
ferences and find common ground. 
We should bring Americans back to-
gether because there is no crisis we 
can’t overcome if we stand united. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. 
HERRERA BEUTLER). 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to stand against 
our enemy. To clarify, our enemy isn’t 
the President or the President-elect. 
Fear is our enemy. Fear tells us what 
we want to hear. It incites anger and 
violence and fire, but it also haunts us 
into silence and inaction. 
What are you afraid of? I am afraid of 
what people will say or think. I am 
afraid of being devalued. I am not 
afraid of losing my job, but I am afraid 
that my country will fail. I am afraid 
patriots of this country have died in 
vain. I am afraid my children won’t 
grow up in a free country. I am afraid 
injustice will prevail. 
But truth, truth sets us free from 
fear. Truth doesn’t guarantee 
bad 
things won’t happen, but it does prom-
ise to always prevail in the end. It has 
no shadows where darkness can hide. 
With truth comes love, and we could 
use that right now. 
My vote to impeach our sitting Presi-
dent is not a fear-based decision. I am 
not choosing a side; I am choosing 
truth. It is the only way to defeat fear. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Today, I should be 
in my district working for my con-
stituents. Instead, I am back here in 
Washington because the majority could 
not resist another made-for-TV im-
peachment. 
American workers are losing their 
jobs and struggling to feed their fami-
lies. Small businesses are being forced 
to lay off workers and close their 
doors. Families are, tragically, losing 
loved ones to the coronavirus. 
Instead of creating or even saving 
American jobs, or negotiating addi-
tional COVID relief, we are debating an 
impeachment that has been preceded 
by no inquiry, no meaningful debate, 
and no due process. 
In 1 week’s time, Joe Biden will be 
the President. The American people 
need us to rise above the heat of the 
moment, to focus on their needs, and 
to deliver real solutions. 
Because the majority decided we 
should debate whether or not to re-
move a sitting President in just 2 
hours, I will be brief: I oppose this Ar-
ticle of Impeachment. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Ms. 
BOURDEAUX). 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, I 
teach a civics class where I point out 
that our democracy is not self-exe-
cuting. It requires people of good faith 
and ethics to make it work. 
The President has repeatedly chal-
lenged Georgia’s election results. But, 
despite three recounts and many inves-
tigations, the results are clear: Joe 
Biden won Georgia. 
The idea that our election was fraud-
ulent is a lie. Our President used this 
lie to incite a violent mob to attack 
the Capitol. 
I ask my colleagues to act with eth-
ics and good faith, to reject these lies,

and, in this case, to support the Article 
of Impeachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. POSEY). 
Mr. POSEY. In our campaigns, we 
may be adversaries, but usually, after 
campaign season is over, we have tradi-
tionally come together for the good of 
our Nation. 
Now more than ever in our lifetimes, 
we are a divided Nation. One of the rea-
sons? The resist movement, which has 
harassed, harangued, and otherwise 
denigrated the President since the sec-
ond he became the nominee. 
While his sins may be different than 
yours or mine, they are clearly not 
treasonous. Let our men and women in 
blue, who suffered a lot more stress 
than the Members of Congress they 
protected, have the time they deserve 
to recuperate, and do the same for mil-
lions of Americans who feel they have 
been disenfranchised. 
I beseech my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle: If you truly want our Na-
tion to heal, vote ‘‘no’’ on this resolu-
tion. 
It reeks of nothing more than re-
venge and sets a dangerous precedent. 
May God continue to bless the United 
States of America. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN. Madam Speaker, a week 
ago, Americans and this Chamber lived 
through one of our darkest days. The 
Commander in Chief incited a mob of 
insurrectionists to overturn the results 
of a free and fair election through ter-
ror and intimidation. 
They failed, but this violence took 
its toll. People died; our country’s tem-
ple of democracy was vandalized; and 
our image as the world’s leading de-
mocracy was shaken. 
President Trump represents a real 
threat to our national security, our 
democratic institutions, and the people 
of this country. 
We cannot let Donald Trump, who ac-
tively orchestrated sedition, lead our 
Nation’s government for another 7 
days. We cannot wait until January 20. 
Donald Trump must be removed. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOODEN). 
Mr. 
GOODEN 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I also want to thank my 
Democratic colleagues for finally join-
ing Republicans in condemning mob vi-
olence after 6 months of refusing to ac-
knowledge it. 
But I am really tired of sanctimo-
nious sermons on being a sore loser 
from some of the same Democrats who 
opposed accepting results in elections 
past. Democrats have objected to certi-
fying every Republican victory of the 
21st century. In 2000, 2004, and in 2016, 
Democrats objected every time. 
When they objected, it was patriotic. 
But when Republicans do it, we are in-
citing a mob; we are liars; and we are 
traitors. This is the double standard we 
should expect under total Democrat 
control. 
They have called for unrest in the 
streets. They have called for harassing 
Cabinet officials. They have objected 
to certifying election results time and 
time again. Even the Judiciary chair-
man secured clemency for a domestic 
terrorist who detonated a bomb right 
here in this building. But we are the 
extremists? I don’t think so. 
We have been silenced by Big Tech on 
social media, by corporate America. 
Now the other side wants to silence us 
on the House floor. 
This is a sad day in America. I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Ms. 
BUSH), a new Member of the House and 
a new member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
Ms. 
BUSH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
St. 
Louis and I rise in support of the Arti-
cle of Impeachment against Donald J. 
Trump. 
If we fail to remove a white suprema-
cist President who incited a white su-
premacist insurrection, it is commu-
nities like Missouri’s First District 
that suffer the most. 
The 117th Congress must understand 
that we have a mandate to legislate in 
defense of Black lives. The first step in 
that process is to root out white su-
premacy, starting with impeaching the 
white supremacist in chief. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. JACKSON). 
Mr. JACKSON. I rise in opposition to 
the Article of Impeachment. 
Let me be clear, what happened last 
Wednesday was a stain on our Nation, 
and the criminals and the rioters re-
sponsible should be prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law. 
It is clear now more than ever that 
our country needs to come together, 
and Congress, this Congress, needs to 
lead by example and begin the process 
of healing the deep division that exists 
among us as Americans. 
The article before us today will not 
accomplish that. In fact, the sham Ar-
ticle of Impeachment will only serve to 
further fan the flames of unrest and to 
appease the radical left’s appetite for 
division. 
We should be focusing on restoring 
communities devastated by lockdowns, 
working on America’s vaccine rollout, 
aiding a bipartisan investigation into 
these attacks, and ensuring election in-
tegrity, not impeaching a President 
who has promised a peaceful transition 
and who has less than 7 days left in of-
fice. 
It is time to focus on the unprece-
dented challenges we face, and it is 
time to focus on unity. For these rea-
sons, I urge my colleagues to oppose 
the Article of Impeachment. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
CLARKE). 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to support H. 
Res. 24, the Article of Impeachment 
against Donald Trump for high crimes 
and misdemeanors for a second time. 
Let us be very clear, what took place 
on January 6, 2021, was an act of do-
mestic terrorism by rightwing syco-
phantic white supremacists, promoted, 
instigated, and advanced by the man in 
the White House, Donald Trump. 
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., once said: ‘‘The ultimate weakness 
of violence is that it is a descending 
spiral, begetting the very thing it 
seeks to destroy. Instead of dimin-
ishing evil, it multiplies it.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, my 
father once said to me: Just because 
you can do something doesn’t mean 
you should. 
In the short time I have served in 
this body, one thing is clear: This is 
not a serious place. 
Last year, we watched as the other 
side delayed COVID relief for months 
to inflict maximum pain and sway the 
outcome of the election. The Speaker 
said as much. 
Yet, these last 2 days, we have seen 
just how fast they can move when they 
want to exact political retribution on 
their opponent. 
My friends on the other side now 
have complete control of both Houses 
of Congress. In a few days, they will 
control the entire executive branch as 
well. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Joe 
Biden 
has 
talked unity and healing. Is that what 
this is today? Is accusing Republican 
lawmakers of sedition and calling for 
their expulsion the plan for healing? Is 
working 
with 
Silicon 
Valley 
to 
digitally disappear those with whom 
they disagree with the plan for rec-
onciliation? 
I was among the first to condemn the 
riots in Madison months ago, and I 
condemn what happened last week. But 
where were the swift accusations of in-
citement and insurrection from the 
other side last year? Is today’s polit-
ical theater a preview of what the 
American people can expect from sin-
gle-party rule, 2 years of double stand-
ards, of punishing those who voted for 
someone else? 
Madam Speaker, I hope Mr. Biden is 
watching today and that he will rise to 
the moment and call off this effort to 
rub salt in the wounds of millions of 
Americans. 
It is now time for all of us, Demo-
crats and Republicans alike, to turn 
down the temperature. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mr. 
CLEAVER). 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it 
would be an error to suppose that men 
and women can be courageous every 
day. It would be unfair to anticipate 
that I or any Member of this body

could be a lion every day. No one is ex-
pected to be a lion day after day after 
day. But on this day, lions are re-
quired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1400 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the 
time. 
After President Trump was not im-
peached, SUSAN COLLINS said he has 
learned a pretty big lesson; he was im-
peached. 
Then he brought his ‘‘It will be 
wild,’’ riotous television show that he 
produced for one person, individual 
one. 
Intelligence reports indicate that the 
people he said he loves and are special 
are going to attack this city and at-
tack this Capitol next week. He has not 
asked them not to do it. He has not 
told them to stand down. I most fear 
January 20 because I think he will try 
to go out with a bang. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
statement from the President: I urge 
that there must be no violence, no law 
breaking, no vandalism of any kind. 
This is not what I stand for, is not 
what America stands for. I call on all 
Americans to help ease tensions and 
calm down. 
I just put out that statement by the 
President of the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the 
time, and I thank the President for his 
words. Above the entrance to the 
House of Representatives is a sculpture 
called the Apotheosis of Democracy. It 
depicts allegorical peace dressed in 
armor and protecting the genius of 
America. 
Last week, that peace was tragically 
torn apart as our U.S. Capitol was in-
vaded for the first time since the War 
of 1812. A violent mob, including many 
with the most hostile of intentions, 
broke past security barriers and un-
leashed destruction and chaos through-
out the Capitol. When it was over, six 
individuals were dead, including two 
Capitol police officers. 
I have always supported the rights of 
citizens to peaceably assemble, but 
those who breached the Capitol and as-
saulted and killed Capitol police should 
be prosecuted to the fullest extent of 
the law. If their intent was to stop the 
constitutional 
requirement 
of 
this 
body to count electoral votes, they 
should be charged and prosecuted for 
insurrection against the government. 
But we are a Nation of laws, not of 
men, and the legal standard for incite-
ment to violence has not been met. 
Now, a week since the riots threat-
ened the people’s House and a week 
until a new President takes office, we 
are rushing through an impeachment 
without all of the facts and evidence 
and without due process. 
We don’t know what kind of informa-
tion the offenders have, what evidence 
will come out during their trials, 
whether it bolsters the majority’s 
claims or the minority’s views, or 
whether it implicates other individ-
uals, groups, or other officials in the 
attack on this hallowed institution. We 
just don’t know, and that is why we 
must treat the power of impeachment 
and our responsibility as holders of 
this power with the seriousness and so-
lemnity it deserves. 
Let us gather the evidence. Let us 
hear the judiciary, make an informed 
decision together. This action will only 
further fuel the political divide among 
our citizens and will be detrimental to 
the long-term efforts to unify our 
country. 
I reiterate my call from last night. 
Let us work together. Both President 
Trump and President-elect Biden have 
called for a peaceful transition of 
power. I humbly beseech my colleagues 
to work toward this end to unify our 
country and not go down this dan-
gerous path. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN). 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
January 6 was a horrific day for our 
country, for our democracy. The Cap-
itol was breached, the blood of our de-
fenders spilled, all because of a lie that 
the elections were stolen, a lie that has 
infected this Nation as perniciously as 
the pandemic. 
President Trump is the source of that 
lie. He has perverted and betrayed his 
oath to defend the Constitution, at-
tacking the foundation of our democ-
racy by inciting his supporters to vio-
lence. He is not fit to serve and is a 
danger to our country while he does. 
I too pledged to support and defend 
the Constitution against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. I will uphold 
that oath. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, what 
did the Speaker know, and what did 
other legislative leaders know, and 
when did they know it? Maybe that is 
a rush to impeach the President so we 
will never know what legislative lead-
ers here knew. 
The FBI knew about a number of in-
dividuals that were planning a war on 
the Capitol, including killing police of-
ficers, and they shared the informa-
tion. But nothing happened. 
The 
chief 
Federal 
prosecutor 
in 
Washington stated he is pursuing con-
spiracy charges. The fact that IEDs 
were constructed and placed informs 
me that there was preplanning for por-
tions of the tragic events last week. 
How does the President incite an at-
tack that was preplanned and already 
underway before his speech concluded? 
Now, I know my colleagues on the 
left want America to believe that the 
President incited a spontaneous riot 
that they would like to call an insur-
rection, but the facts are stubborn 
things, even if you choose to ignore 
them. 
The truth is the multiple lawless and 
violent events last summer, including a 
months-long siege of a Federal court-
house, burning, looting, physical vio-
lence in so-called sanctuary cities, 
more closely fits the definition of in-
surrection than anything the President 
said last week. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY). 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding. 
The American people are asking: Is 
there any depravity too low? Is there 
any outrage too far? Is there any blood 
and violence too much to turn hearts 
and minds in this body instead of the 
usual justification, rationalization, and 
enabling in false equivalence we have 
to hear? 
This is a moment of truth, my 
friends. Are you on the side of chaos 
and the mob, or on the side of constitu-
tional democracy and our freedom? It 
is that simple. That is what this vote 
for impeachment represents. 
Madam Speaker, I will not turn a blind eye 
to the President inciting an armed insurrection 
against Congress. 
In the leadup to the election and in its after-
math, the President peddled outrageous lies to 
overturn a free and fair election. 
When that didn’t work, he launched an 
armed attack on a coequal branch of govern-
ment. 
As the mob closed in, I will never forget it, 
the banging got louder. (BANG) 
The President watched the violence unfold 
on television. (BANG) 
Republicans begged him to call off the mob. 
(BANG) 
Instead, the President attacked his own Vice 
President whose life was already in danger. 
(BANG) 
Now five people are dead, and some of my 
colleagues are calling for unity. 
I support unity, but unity cannot be a subter-
fuge for avoiding accountability. 
And today, I vote for accountability. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, could 
I inquire how much time each side has 
remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 25 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 311⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I stood in that gallery to defend 
this Chamber against the violent mob 
called here by Donald Trump. I have 
dedicated my life to the defense of our 
Nation, and Donald Trump is a risk to 
all that I love. 
Some of my Republican colleagues 
are afraid of the consequences of an im-
peachment vote, but this Congress

Leadership is hard. It is time to im-

Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I

gentleman from Illinois (Mr. DANNY K. 
DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding me the time. 
I heard a few minutes ago that there 
had been no hearings. Well, I have 
heard from the people of the Seventh 
District of Illinois. They have told me 
what to do. They have said: Impeach 
this President. Impeach this President, 
and do it now. 
I will follow their instructions and 
vote ‘‘yes’’ to impeach this President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
On January 6, terrorists attacked the 
United States of America. It was an at-
tempted coup and an insurrection. But 
what I hope Americans understand is 
that it was a terrorist attack against 
our country. 
Those who came and participated 
must be found and prosecuted. Those 
who aided and abetted must be found 
and prosecuted. And the man who in-
cited it, President Donald J. Trump, 
our greatest national security threat, 
must be impeached, held accountable, 
and never be allowed to hold office 
again. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 30 seconds to distinguished gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. ESHOO). 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, future 
generations are not going to know the 
names of each Member in the Chamber 
today and voting, but they will know 
what we did and why. We must im-
peach the President because he incited 
the mob that attacked the Capitol of 
the United States, the tabernacle of 
our democracy. He is incapable of hon-
oring his oath and our Constitution, 
and he has proven to be unfit and dan-
gerous. 
I will vote to impeach this traitor to 
our country. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
today I cast my vote for the second 
time to impeach Donald J. Trump. He 
is unfit to hold office. He summonsed 
and dispatched his mob to kidnap and 
hurt many of us. He is unfit to hold of-
fice. 
He summonsed and dispatched his 
mob to assassinate Vice President 
PENCE, to assassinate Speaker PELOSI. 
He is unfit to hold office. 
He summonsed and dispatched a mob 
that waved the racist Confederate flag 
and assaulted this Capitol, resulting in 
the death of five Americans, including 
two Capitol Police officers. He is unfit 
to hold office. We must impeach now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in the strongest 
possible support for the impeachment 
of Donald J. Trump. When Trump made 
a last desperate attempt to steal the 
Presidency, to reject the will of the 
people by encouraging insurrection, he 
became the first President to incite an 
attempted overthrow of the institu-
tions he is sworn to protect. 
That is a horrifying first, and his ac-
tions necessitate another. He should be 
the first President impeached and re-
moved from office in the history of our 
country. I voted to impeach him once, 
and I am willing to do it again. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I now 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, this President took an oath to pro-
tect and defend the Constitution. In-
stead, he has chosen to betray and at-
tack our sacred democracy. 
This President violated his oath. He 
abused the power of his office, at-
tempted to betray the will of the 
American people, and incited insurrec-
tion against this very House. 
During the last impeachment trial, I 
reminded all Americans that democ-
racy is a gift that each generation 
gives to the next. We must do all to 
protect it for our children and our fu-
ture. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. STEUBE). 
Mr. STEUBE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. For 
3 years, Democratic Members of this 
body and the mainstream media lied to 
the American people that the Trump 
campaign colluded and conspired with 
Russia—for years—after an exhaustive 
investigation was found that there was 
no evidence that the Trump campaign 
colluded with Russia. 
Should Democratic Members of this 
body resign for lying to the American 
people repeatedly and sowing division 
and dissension all across America? And 
it was all a lie. 
Madam Speaker, you have brought 
one Article of Impeachment to the 
floor, and your one allegation alleges: 
‘‘Donald John Trump engaged in high 
crimes and misdemeanors by inciting 
violence against the Government of 
United States.’’ 
In D.C., it is a crime to ‘‘inten-
tionally or recklessly act in such a 
manner to cause another person to be 
in reasonable fear and to incite or pro-
voke violence when there is a likeli-
hood that such violence will ensue.’’ 
There was no language in the Presi-
dent’s speech that incited or provoked 
violence. In fact, at around the 18- 
minute mark, he stated: ‘‘Peacefully 
and patriotically make your voices 
heard.’’ 
You may think that he is inciting vi-
olence because he believes there was 
election fraud. That is his opinion, and 
he is entitled to that opinion, just like 
all of you were entitled to your false 
and fraudulent opinion that the Trump 
campaign colluded with Russia. 
The legal elements of incitement are 
based on the Supreme Court case Bran-
denburg v. Ohio, in which the Supreme 
Court set the standard for speech that 
could be prosecuted without violating 
the First Amendment. Brandenburg’s 
speech 
called 
for 
violence 
against 
groups of Americans, and the Court 
found that Brandenburg’s comments 
were not directed to inciting or pro-
ducing imminent lawless action. 
The Court found that it was pro-
tected speech, and he was calling for 
violence. That is the current law of the 
land. 
The President didn’t even mention 
violence last Wednesday, much less 
provoke or incite it. There was no 
crime committed; therefore, no basis 
for impeachment, as you need a high 
crime or misdemeanor for a basis. 
You have created a mockery out of 
the impeachment process, and I urge 
all my colleagues to stand against it 
and fight the latest fraud being per-
petrated against the American people 
by the radical left.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Nevada 
(Mr. 
HORSFORD). 
Mr. HORSFORD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Article of Im-
peachment. Last Wednesday’s events 
were not just a breach of a building, 
but a breach of our democracy, a 
threat to our Republic and to who we 
are as Americans. 
Donald Trump incited insurrection 
against America and attempted to 
overturn the will of the people. We 
must send a clear message that com-
mitting sedition disqualifies a Presi-
dent from serving another day in of-
fice. I urge this body to vote for im-
peachment. I will. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I

shook me to my core. She was worried 
about the future of this great Nation, 
and I am, too. That is why I must move 
forward with impeachment of this 
President. He has endangered this Na-
tion. He has betrayed his oath. 
I do this now for all of us, for our 
Constitution, and for this Republic. I 
do this to tell the world that this great 
democracy will stand and no one is 
above the law. I do this for our future 
generations. 
I urge us all to unite and to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on impeachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
HUFFMAN). 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, his-
tory is watching and saving the re-
ceipts. Today, my colleagues across the 
aisle must choose which side of a very 
bright line they want to be recorded on 
for all time. 
On one side: Lies, sedition, inciting 
and supporting insurrection and do-
mestic terrorism. 
The other side: Your oath of office, 
the Constitution, democracy, decency. 
There is no middle ground. Today, we 
make history forever. So choose well. 
A vote to impeach Donald Trump 
means, years from now, you can look 
your grandchildren in the eye and say, 
‘‘I did the right thing.’’ 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. JA-
COBS). 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, the response to political vio-
lence must always be accountability. 
Without accountability, more violence 
will follow. I learned that working at 
the United Nations and the State De-
partment in conflict settings around 
the world, and the United States Con-
gress is now a conflict setting. 
A violent mob threatened our lives in 
this Chamber and almost succeeded, in-
cited by the President, who broad-
casted live about the outcome of our 
election. We must hold this President 
accountable. It is the only way to pro-
tect our democracy. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I am certain that every Mem-
ber of Congress would say, if they had 
been in Congress when John Lewis 
walked across that Edmund Pettus 
Bridge and the Civil Rights Act was 
passed, they would have stood on the 
right side of history. 
Well, Madam Speaker, today, we are 
going to see exactly what side of his-
tory Members are going to be on. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
today represents a unique opportunity 
in our Nation’s history, an opportunity 
to put America first, to put her people 
first. Today is a moment for Members 
of Congress to put aside partisan poli-
ticking and place people over power. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this divisive impeachment and realize 
that dividing America will not save 
this Republic. I urge my colleagues to 
not simply vote for what feels good. 
Of course, it feels good for the Demo-
crats to have a united constituency for 
a few more days, but I was elected to 
come here and vote for things that ac-
tually do good, to bring much-needed 
help to the American people. 
I am willing to take the first step 
and extend my hand across the aisle to 
say: Vote against impeachment; vote 
in favor of a unified nation; and I will 
forsake partisanship and work with 
you, no matter who you are or what 
party you come from. 
Madam Speaker, I urge that we all 
vote to finally put America first. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. JONES), a new Member 
of the House and a new member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the impeachment of Donald 
J. 
Trump, 
the 
disgraced, 
defeated 
President of the United States. There 
must be consequences for last week’s 
treason and sedition. Hundreds, if not 
thousands, of Donald Trumps in to-
day’s Republican Party aim to run for 
higher office; and we must send a mes-
sage that no one in the United States 
of America is above the law. The world 
is watching, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. KIL-
DEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, 1 week 
ago, the President of the United States 
incited a deadly attack on the United 
States Capitol, while a couple of dozen 
Members of this House and I covered 
ourselves in that Gallery, away from 
the Trump mob. Five dead, including 
Capitol Police. If inciting an insurrec-
tion does not warrant impeachment, 
nothing does. 
I took an oath to uphold the Con-
stitution against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. KILDEE. Today, I uphold my 
oath. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to strongly object to the Ar-
ticle of Impeachment proposed against 
President Trump, which makes the pre-
posterous claim that President Trump 
wanted or expected the riots that took 
place last week. He clearly said he 
wanted a peaceful and patriotic dem-
onstration. He did say he wanted peo-
ple to ‘‘fight like hell or we are not 
going to have a country anymore,’’ but 
that is obviously standard hyperbole 
and was not meant to aim at physical 
fights. 
But what is offensive is what you are 
saying—and 
is 
inflammatory—about 
the tens of thousands of peaceful pro-
testers who were there last week, as 
well as the tens of millions of people 
they represent. You don’t understand 
why they are here. 
They are scared to death we are 
going to go back to the days without 
Donald Trump, of hundreds of thou-
sands of people crossing the border 
every month. They are scared to death 
nobody is going to keep our manufac-
turing here. They are scared to death 
that nobody else will fight the cancel 
culture as we head toward an era when 
some things can’t be said. They are 
scared to death that the majority 
party got here by teaming up with 
Black Lives Matter, a bunch founded 
by Marxists and the dislike of family. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today determined to fulfill our sa-
cred oath to protect and defend the 
Constitution from all enemies, foreign 
and domestic. Last week’s violent in-
surrection on the Capitol was a stain 
on our democracy. A riotous mob in-
cited by the President stormed these 
very Halls, beat and murdered police 
officers, planted pipe bombs, and left 
our Nation shocked and in mourning. 
The President’s rhetoric, actions, and 
refusal to accept responsibilities are an 
imminent threat to our Nation. I vote 
to impeach the President. I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, my parents brought me as an 
infant to America because they knew it 
is the land of democracy. It is the bea-
con of hope for all the world. We called 
it the American Dream. 
When Donald Trump told rioters to 
go to the Capitol and, quote, unquote, 
‘‘fight like hell,’’ he incited an attack 
on the Capitol and the ideals com-
prising the American Dream. 
I am voting for impeachment because 
I know we are still the country my par-
ents believed in, and I will fight like 
hell for it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, 
on Wednesday, the 6th, Democrats and 
Republicans hid on the floor, put on 
gas masks, and were ushered out of 
this room.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H178 
January 13, 2021 
We, in this country, cannot begin 
healing and unity without account-
ability and justice. The President of 
the United States incited a violent in-
surrection against Congress—you, me— 
and the Vice President of the United 
States. This cannot be ignored. Im-
peach now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, on January 6, Donald Trump 
incited his white nationalist supporters 
to initiate an attempted coup against 
the heart of our democracy, the United 
States Capitol. This heinous act of do-
mestic terrorism demands that Con-
gress act to remove this President. 
Donald Trump has been, and remains, 
a threat to our national security and 
our democracy, and he is wholly unfit 
to serve as President. He and his sup-
porters must be held accountable for 
inciting violence against the Govern-
ment of the United States. Congress 
must act immediately to remove this 
clear and present danger from our 
country. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I am against the impeach-
ment effort by the Democrats. 
President Trump has held over 600 
rallies in the last 4 years. None of them 
included assaulting police, destroying 
businesses, or burning down cities. 
Democrats have spent all this time 
endorsing and enabling violent riots 
that left billions in property damage 
and 47 dead across the United States. 
Democrats are on record supporting 
violence when it serves their cause, in 
their own words on social media, on 
interviews, and on the fundraising plat-
form ActBlue. 
Democrats support defunding the po-
lice when it is someone else’s city, 
someone else’s home, and someone 
else’s business. Democrats will take 
away everyone’s guns, just as long as 
they have guards with guns. 
Democrats’ impeachment of Presi-
dent Trump today has now set the 
standard that they should be removed 
for their support of violence against 
the American people. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, for 2 months, Donald Trump 
used the biggest megaphone in the 
world to organize a campaign of out-
right lies to overturn a free and fair 
election. On January 6, he summoned 
and incited a mob of domestic terror-
ists to fight like hell and sent them to 
ransack this Capitol in order to pre-
vent us from formalizing his election 
loss. It was a grotesque orgy of deadly 
white 
supremacism, 
anti-Semitism, 
and strongman rule. 
Today, we will do our duty and vote 
to remove the author of this horrifying 
chapter and banish him from public 
service. 
b 1430 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, can I 
inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 20 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 213⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. LEVIN). 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam 
Speaker, what each of us chooses to do 
today, whether we vote to hold this 
President to account or look the other 
way, we will be remembered by history, 
by our children and their children. 
The facts are clear, the evidence of 
Trump’s 
insurrection 
overwhelming. 
History calls on us to do what is right 
rather than just politically expedient. 
Let us look back on this day with 
honor, not disgrace, knowing we were 
up to the oath we all took. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA). 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, the 
perpetrators of this heinous attack on 
our Nation’s democracy were Ameri-
cans encouraged and emboldened by 
President Trump because he could not 
accept the outcome of a free and fair 
election. 
His actions are seditious, and the 
President has proven that he is not fit 
to serve. History will look back on this 
moment to see who stood strong in 
support of American democracy. 
As my colleagues have said, we must 
come together, but our Nation cannot 
begin to heal until there is account-
ability for the atrocity we witnessed 
last week. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the effort to im-
peach President Trump. This course of 
action will only increase dissent and 
disunity across our country, and it 
flies in the face of all efforts to heal 
our Nation. 
Quite simply, it is a shameful final 
act of political retribution, retribution 
this President has weathered since day 
one. 
I have no doubt that those who 
breached the Capitol will have due 
process and their day in court. How-
ever, there will be no investigation in 
the people’s House into whether the al-
legation against the President meets 
the criteria for a crime worthy of im-
peachment. No evidence was presented. 
No witness testified. No cross-examina-
tion was conducted. No due process was 
afforded. That sets an extremely dan-
gerous precedent for the future. 
If my Democratic colleagues were se-
rious in their efforts to get to the 
truth, they would convene the House 
Judiciary Committee and investigate, 
but they are not. 
And so I am proud to stand before 
you today to defend our President from 
the injustices my Democratic col-
leagues are so giddy to pursue. I oppose 
this effort to impeach the President 
and ask all Members of the House to do 
the same. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
rise with a heavy heart for what our 
Nation has endured. 
All those who have incited an attack 
on these Halls of freedom must never 
forget that, in every generation, Amer-
icans of all colors and creeds have laid 
down their lives in the struggles 
against tyranny, the fight against fas-
cism, and the defense against those 
who would betray the values upon 
which this Nation was founded. 
It is our duty to shoulder that de-
fense of our democracy here today. The 
President’s actions have laid bare his 
contempt for our Constitution, and he 
must be removed. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS). 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, the 
armed insurrectionists who stormed 
the Capitol did not emerge out of a 
vacuum. They were lied to by Repub-
lican Senators and Republican Con-
gressmen and -women. But they were 
incited to violence by one man above 
all else: Donald J. Trump, who tried to 
be the ultimate ruler of our democracy. 
The world is watching. Our allies are 
watching, and our adversaries are 
watching. We must show them that no 
one will rule this country and be above 
the law. The cameras of history are 
rolling. We must act. We must impeach 
Donald J. Trump and show the world 
what we stand for. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, last Wednesday, on my third day, I 
realized that I can make hard and 
seemingly unpopular decisions. Voting 
to strip electoral college votes from 
States is a dangerous precedent set by 
Democrats many years ago and perpet-
uated by my party as well. I heard 
nothing in those debates that justified 
such a high bar. 
A rushed impeachment will set a 
similar precedent. Without a single 
hearing or investigation, I simply can-
not reach the high bar of impeachment. 
To my district, I commit to con-
stantly being objective in all of my de-
cision-making. 
And, as I abandon the remainder of 
my remarks, as I listen to this debate, 
it is no wonder our Nation is divided. 
We are on an absolute race to the bot-
tom. I was hoping that last week we 
could have hit rock bottom.

I commit to doing better, and I hope 
that we all can dig in and find a way. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Madam Speaker, do-
mestic terrorists attacked our democ-
racy, urged on by a sitting President. 
These insurrectionists believe Donald 
Trump’s lies about the stolen election. 
They obeyed his call to attack. They 
literally 
carried 
his 
banner 
while 
storming the Capitol. 
Last week’s insurrection was shock-
ing and tragic. It was the culmination 
of 4 years of assaults on our democ-
racy. 
We must impeach this President. And 
the Congressional Black Caucus stands 
ready to join in a bipartisan message 
to the likes of Donald Trump. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Wisconsin (Ms. MOORE). 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
President 
radicalized 
American citizens. As his Vice Presi-
dent fled from a lynch mob and the 
Speaker cowered and while people died, 
he watched with glee. 
That is why, even though it is only 7 
days before the end of his term, we 
have the fierce urgency of now. Seven 
days is too long for him to be in power. 
He could declassify state secrets. He 
could monetize national secrets to for-
eign adversaries. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise with great sorrow to oppose this 
second attempt at a baseless impeach-
ment from my Democrat colleagues. 
This week’s attack on the U.S. Cap-
itol was completely unacceptable, and 
the people involved should be met with 
swift accountability. 
The President didn’t incite a riot. 
The President didn’t lead an insurrec-
tion. There are no high crimes and mis-
demeanors requisite of an impeach-
ment. 
I am not saying the President didn’t 
exercise poor judgment, but to crim-
inalize political speech by blaming law-
less acts on the President’s rhetoric is 
wrong, Madam Speaker, and a very 
dangerous precedent. 
The criminals who stormed the Cap-
itol that day acted on their own voli-
tion. They are responsible for their ac-
tions. 
This 
is 
an 
important 
moment, 
Madam Speaker, for our Nation. We 
have the opportunity to come together 
and do what is right for our country. 
The 
votes 
are 
certified; 
President 
Trump has conceded. Let’s focus on the 
future and get back to the people’s 
business. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. NEWMAN). 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor to speak today. So, today, I 
stand with this body to impeach this 
President. 
I agree with my Democratic col-
leagues. I also agree with my Repub-
lican colleagues: Let’s unite. 
Let’s unite to address this pandemic 
and start by simply wearing a mask. 
Let’s unite to bring back the economy 
and start by putting $2,000 checks in 
people’s pockets. And let’s unite to 
hold these domestic terrorists account-
able and impeach this President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 181⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Ohio has 17 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS). 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today at a time of historical con-
cern: Last week, on this very House 
floor, an attack on democracy, that 
symbol. But it was an attack from 
within on this very floor. 
Let’s be clear. Cause and effect: rally 
at the White House, march down Penn-
sylvania Avenue—a parade in reverse— 
and an attack on this Chamber. 
A police officer was killed, and what 
I hear is, ‘‘Time to heal.’’ He is not 
even buried yet. 
It is clear and present danger. No one 
is above the law—not the President, if 
he has 4 years or 4 days. We must do 
the right thing for all Americans be-
cause he must be held accountable. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I ap-
preciate a variety of opinions, but any 
accusations must go through the prop-
er due process, whether it is election 
fraud or an impeachable offense. 
As someone who did not support the 
objection to certification last week, I 
will not support this political charade 
today. 
The rule of law and due process is 
vital to what our constitutional Repub-
lic stands for. Congress should stop 
playing divisive politics and start 
working on delivering real, good poli-
cies for the American people. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, a 
week ago was the culmination of car-
nage caused to our country by this 
President. Four years ago, he said he 
would stop such devastation. Instead, 
the President has continued to debase 
our democracy with assaults on our 
elections and incitement at the Ellipse 
and the battery at our Capitol. 
American exceptionalism is not guar-
anteed; we must always work to grow 
it. That includes our work today to 
hold President Trump accountable. 
American carnage started with this 
President. A vote for impeachment will 
stop it for our posterity. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, the 
U.S. Capitol has not been breached for 
over 200 years, since the War of 1812— 
that is, until last week, when it wasn’t 
another country that attacked us but 
our own President. 
President Donald Trump asked his 
supporters to march on the Capitol, in-
citing domestic terrorism that cost 
five lives, including a Capitol Police of-
ficer. 
We all know, whether you say it 
aloud or not, Donald Trump is respon-
sible for inciting the attacks on our de-
mocracy, while he should have been the 
one person protecting it the most. For 
that, he is unfit to be President, and 
we must impeach him. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio for yielding. 
The President of the United States 
deserves universal condemnation for 
what was clearly, in my opinion, im-
peachable conduct, pressuring the Vice 
President to violate his oath to the 
Constitution to count the electors. 
His open and public pressure, coura-
geously rejected by the Vice President, 
purposefully seeded the false belief 
among the President’s supporters, in-
cluding those assembled on January 6, 
that there was a legal path for the 
President to stay in power. It was fore-
seeable and reckless to sow such a false 
belief that could lead to violence and 
rioting by loyal supporters whipped 
into a frenzy. 
b 1445 
Unfortunately, my Democratic col-
leagues drafted an article that I believe 
is flawed and unsupportable, focusing 
on the legal terms of incitement and 
insurrection. 
Even noting impeachment does not 
require meeting a certain legal stand-
ard—the danger for open speech and de-
bate in this body and for the Republic 
is high—if the House approves the arti-
cle as written. 
The language will be used to target 
Members of this body under Section 3 
of the 14th Amendment. It will be used 
to suggest that any statements we 
make are subject to review by our col-
leagues and to send us down a perilous 
path of cleansing political speech in 
the public square. 
Madam Speaker, we must end this. 
Let us condemn that which must be 
condemned, and do so loudly. But let 
us do it the right way, with delibera-
tion and without disastrous side ef-
fects. We must end tearing apart our 
Nation by social media and sound 
bites. Let us stop. Let us debate. Let us 
sit down and lead this Nation together. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY).

January 13, 2021 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, this vote is not 
one man, one party, or even one day. It 
is about protecting our Nation, pre-
serving democracy and the rule of law. 
The facts are clear and undisputed: 
President Trump used a litany of lies 
about a stolen election and willfully 
incited an armed insurrection with the 
intent of stopping the peaceful transfer 
of power. He attacked not just the Cap-
itol, not just Congress, he even at-
tacked democracy itself. That is why 
he must be impeached. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
PRICE). 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, the President has engaged in 
conduct that is criminal, impeachable, 
and profoundly threatening to our de-
mocracy. 
He pressed State officials and Mem-
bers of this body to overturn a legiti-
mate election and to keep him in 
power. He then invited and activated a 
violent mob to invade the Capitol and 
achieve his desired result by insurrec-
tion. 
If that is not impeachable conduct, I 
don’t know what is. The President 
must be removed from office imme-
diately and never allowed to hold office 
again. Our democracy requires it. 
Madam Speaker, the president has engaged 
in conduct that is criminal, impeachable, and 
profoundly threatening to our democracy. 
He has sought to overturn an election to 
keep himself in office and to prevent the 
peaceful transfer of power. 
He has done this by perpetrating a big lie, 
despite counts and recounts and dozens of ju-
dicial rulings, and has pressed state officials 
and members of this body to reject and re-
verse popular and electoral vote outcomes. 
He then invited and activated a violent mob 
of right-wing extremists, domestic terrorists, 
and white nationalists to invade the Capitol 
and achieve his desired result by insurrection. 
If that is not impeachable conduct, I don’t 
know what is. 
The President must be removed from office 
immediately and must never be allowed to 
seek office again, and a marker must be laid 
down for all time as to what the Constitution 
and our democracy require. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. FALLON). 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, last 
summer, the antifa and BLM riots 
swept all over our country. Cities were 
burned, businesses destroyed, and lives 
violently stolen. And it wasn’t just for 
an afternoon, like those horrible hours 
we had on January 6; but rather, they 
went for weeks and, in some cases, 
even months. 
So if there is any silver lining in this 
dark cloud, it is that our friends from 
across the aisle have come to realize 
that riots are bad. We conservatives 
have known this all along. 
This snap impeachment is a sham 
and it didn’t go through the Committee 
on the Judiciary. It is not even about 
the President’s actual words, but it is 
about how our Democratic colleagues 
want to interpret his words and fashion 
a particular meaning to them. 
Now, 
this 
is 
just 
political 
grandstanding at its worst. The Amer-
ican people desperately want us to 
move on and tackle the issues and find 
solutions to them forthwith. 
Madam Speaker, let’s end this obses-
sion and charade and let’s get to work. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY). 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, now 
we hear talk of the President’s notion 
of a peaceful transfer of power. 
Which apparently means what? Mini-
mal casualties? 
Now we hear talk of healing after the 
criminal acts are completed. 
Never, as a criminal defense attor-
ney, did I say: Judge, yeah, my guy 
completed the armed robbery, but let’s 
heal now. 
No. There was accountability. There 
was accountability then, there should 
be 
accountability 
now, 
and 
there 
should be impeachment now. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS), a new member of the com-
mittee. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Article of Im-
peachment. The President’s responsi-
bility for the violence and insurrection 
that occurred last Wednesday cannot 
go unanswered. The President has had 
multiple opportunities to modify his 
behavior to bring this country to-
gether. Instead, he uses his power to 
further divide us. He is unrepentant. 
Congress must act for the good of 
this country. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I stand today in support of Presi-
dent Trump and against this sham im-
peachment proceeding with literally 1 
week—7 days—remaining in his term. 
This is merely the culmination of a 4- 
year effort to overturn the will of the 
people and the results for the 2016 elec-
tion. 
This is simply a political action in-
tended to tarnish the legacy of a highly 
successful President who led us to an 
incredible economy, energy independ-
ence, reduction of taxes for millions, 
regulatory relief for businesses, re-
newed peace in the Middle East, and 
stronger border security. 
This action will only serve to further 
offend the 75 million people who voted 
for President Trump, and further deep-
en the division within our Nation as we 
try to move forward with the peaceful 
transition of power. 
However, the Democrat majority has 
determined he is already guilty and 
there is no need of a trial; and they, 
therefore, move forward quickly with 
this phony impeachment charge. 
Today, I join my Republican col-
leagues in standing against this further 
effort to divide our Nation. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the impeachment. 
It is very simple. What we saw on 
January 6 was a person, the President 
of the United States, incite a crowd to 
come and attack the Capitol. We have 
to make sure that we stand up for de-
mocracy. 
If we don’t do this, then what are we 
going to stand for? 
We stand for democracy. We stand for 
American values. And I stand for the 
impeachment of Donald Trump. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. 
SCANLON). 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, on 
January 6, President Trump launched 
an attack against the United States 
Capitol. I, too, urge my colleagues to 
unite, but to unite in love of country, 
and to hold this President accountable. 
What unites our country is respect 
for the rule of law. Without account-
ability for those who would shatter the 
rule of law by overturning a Presi-
dential election, we cannot take seri-
ously the cries of being a united people. 
This President remains a serious 
threat to our country and he must be 
held accountable. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. DAVID 
SCOTT). 
Mr. 
DAVID 
SCOTT 
of 
Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, let me make every-
body aware that on those just sun- 
bleached bones of history of many 
great nations are written those poetic 
words: Too late, they move too late to 
save their great nations. 
Madam Speaker, let us not this day 
move too late to save our great Nation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today for two reasons: One, to voice my 
strong opposition for the impeachment 
of this President with 7 days left. Two, 
to also voice my support for the strong 
police department many of you want to 
defund. 
Where were your cries to defund 
when you were leaving this office, this 
very room, on January 6? 
Height of hypocrisy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are kindly reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. SHER-
MAN).

January 13, 2021 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, how 
ironic. An administration begins by 
building an unnecessary wall on our 
southern border, it ends by making 
necessary, a new wall around this Cap-
itol. 
Madam Speaker, I introduced Arti-
cles of Impeachment in July of 2017 
with one cosponsor, AL
GREEN, and 
again in January of 2019. And on Mon-
day night, I joined with so many of us 
in introducing these articles. I have in-
troduced Articles of Impeachment in 
the 115th, 116th, and 117th Congress be-
cause Donald Trump has continuously 
posed a danger to this republic. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise 
with a very simple question. On Janu-
ary 6, thousands broke the law by tak-
ing siege of our Capitol here with us in-
side. 
Has any one of those individuals who 
brought violence on this Capitol been 
brought here to answer whether they 
did that because of our President? 
It appears I will receive no answer. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STAN-
TON). 
Mr. 
STANTON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Donald Trump is the first President in 
the history of this Republic to incite a 
violent insurrection against our own 
government, against our own people. It 
is a shocking betrayal of his oath of of-
fice and our American values. We don’t 
know yet if the President will face 
criminal charges, but we do know he 
must be held to account. 
Each one of us in this House took an 
oath to protect and defend our Con-
stitution against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic, even if that enemy is the 
President. 
We must move forward as a nation 
from these darkest days, but we can’t 
move forward without accountability. 
We must impeach this President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. STE-
VENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, in-
surrection. A violent mob. A week ago 
today, five people were killed, many in-
jured, and everyone in this building 
forced to hide for their very life. 
The President was called for help, 
but he did not answer our call while 
our government was being taken over. 
He failed to lead and, therefore, proved 
himself incapable of doing so. 
Some may say impeachment is polit-
ical. Some may cry it is divisive. 
Madam Speaker, our obligation to our 
Constitution is to protect this Nation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the impeachment of 
President Donald Trump. The gravity 
of the moment demands it, and the fate 
of our Republic depends on it. 
He committed an impeachable of-
fense by inciting a violent and deadly 
insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. For 
this, Congress must hold him account-
able to preserve our democracy, our 
Constitution, and the rule of law. 
He should serve not 1 minute more 
and be barred forever from public of-
fice. He is toxic to our Republic and 
toxic to our democracy. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
So Democrats can say, ‘‘I just don’t 
even know why there aren’t uprisings 
all over the country,’’ while there are 
uprisings happening around the coun-
try, but they impeach the President of 
the United States for saying, ‘‘Peace-
fully and patriotically, make your 
voices heard.’’ 
Democrats can say, ‘‘You know, 
there 
needs 
to 
be 
unrest 
in 
the 
streets,’’ while there is unrest in the 
streets, but they are going to impeach 
the President for saying, ‘‘Peacefully 
and patriotically, make your voices 
heard.’’ 
Let’s be consistent, all of us. All of 
us need to be consistent and condemn 
the violence all the time. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico 
(Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to these Articles of 
Impeachment. 
Political violence has no place in our 
constitutional Republic, and those who 
assaulted police officers and forced 
their way into the Capitol are respon-
sible for their criminal actions. 
Leaders in both parties have a re-
sponsibility to condemn such violence, 
whether in the Halls of Congress or on 
the streets of America. 
I don’t believe, Madam Speaker, that 
the American people have an appetite 
for this. They are expecting us to do 
the will of those who sent us from each 
State around the Nation. 
Right now, Madam Speaker, we are 
seeing this body that has impeached 
once before trying to do it a second 
time. Two wrongs do not make a right. 
We have got to stand for the Amer-
ican people, because we will not get a 
second chance to get this right the 
first time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
TORRES), who is a new Member. 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Madam 
Speaker, the dangerous mob that Don-
ald Trump unleashed on the United 
States Capitol represents a violent as-
sault on the separation of powers and 
on the peaceful transfer of power that 
we have long taken for granted. 
The impeachment of Donald Trump 
is not politics but law, not passion but 
reason, not vengeance but justice. And 
we, as the people’s Representatives, 
must rise to the challenge of defending 
democracy in the face of its gravest 
threat, and we will. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Mrs. 
TRAHAN). 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
stand before you today in disbelief— 
disbelief that, after the President in-
cited a violent mob to commit an act 
of insurrection and remained silent as 
police officers were assaulted, the Cap-
itol was ransacked, and Members of 
this body fled for their lives, that there 
are still members of his party who 
refuse to hold him accountable. 
It is because of that inaction that 
there is only one path forward to put 
an end to this Presidency. Donald 
Trump must be impeached, removed 
from office, and barred from ever hold-
ing the Office of the Presidency again. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this resolution be-
cause, in America, we hold power to ac-
count. In America, we do not succumb 
to violent insurrections incited by a 
head of state. In America, we do not 
turn a blind eye to high crimes and 
misdemeanors. No. That is not who we 
are. 
So, today, as a sworn defender of this 
Nation’s Constitution, I will vote in 
favor of impeaching Donald J. Trump. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire of the time remaining for each 
side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 10 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 93⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, la-
dies and gentlemen, welcome to the 
second annual impeachment show ex-
travaganza, brought to you by the cen-
sors in left-wing media, the fact-check 
ministers of shutdown in Big Tech, and 
the Democrat Party. 
Today, the second annual impeach-
ment of President Trump isn’t really 
about actual words spoken at a rally. 
No. This is all about, Madam Speaker, 
the unbridled hatred of this President. 
You use any extreme language and 
any process to oppose the core of what 
he has really fought for. You hate him 
because he is pro-life, the strongest 
ever. You hate him for fighting for the 
freedom of religion, to not be per-
secuted by unfair mandates and limita-
tions on speech. 
You hate him for not subscribing to 
and shackling us with the religion of

climate change and one-sided Paris ac-
cords. You hate him for Israel. You 
hate him for defending our borders. 
You hate him for letting families and 
small businesses keep what they earn, 
for trying to keep the agents of govern-
ment off their back. 
You hate him for putting America 
first, which is what I thought we do 
when we swear the oath. 
No, this shabby show isn’t about a 
threat to our Republic. This is the im-
peachment and muting of at least half 
of the American people. This is a 
shameful abuse of a process. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from California an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
pray people of all stripes wake up to 
the spectacle and exercise their rights 
to put a stop to it through free speech 
and through fair elections. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
impeachment of President Donald J. 
Trump for seditious acts against Amer-
ica. 
To overturn the 2020 Presidential 
election, Trump incited a violent as-
sault on Congress—a treasonous be-
trayal of our Nation. This criminal in-
citement left us with five dead, includ-
ing a police officer; a desecrated Cap-
itol; and a second constitutional crisis. 
His acts show contempt for the rule 
of law, the Constitution, and the foun-
dation of any democracy: a peaceful 
transition of power. 
President Trump is a clear and 
present danger to American lives and 
democracy, and he leaves us no choice 
but to immediately remove him from 
office. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 90 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Tennessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER). 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote 
against impeachment of our sitting 
President, Donald J. Trump. 
You can tell the American people 
that this is a vote to impeach upon the 
grounds of inciting violence and insur-
rection, but the American people see a 
double standard. They see a standard 
applied to those on the left who com-
mit violence, and they see a standard 
applied to those on the right who com-
mit violence. The American people see 
this, and they understand it. 
I have been here all of 1 week, and 
what I see instead of lawmakers who 
are truth-seekers, I see lawmakers who 
are power-seekers. That is never good— 
never good. What a shame. What a 
shame. 
The American people are watching to 
see how their elected officials respond 
at this moment in history. Will you 
vote to mend or will you vote to fur-
ther divide this country? 
I am urging you to use this oppor-
tunity to be the leaders the American 
people are seeking for such a time as 
this. 
God help us as a nation, and I pray 
that God will keep His hand upon on 
the greatest nation that the world has 
ever seen. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time is remaining, please? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 91⁄4 minutes 
remaining, and the gentleman from 
Ohio has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speak-
er, President Trump’s incitement to 
violently overturn the results of a free 
and fair election is an attack on our 
rule of law. 
Any President, any Member of Con-
gress who obstructs the electoral col-
lege or attacks judges and the court 
system when there is no evidence to 
support their contentions undermines 
the public’s trust and confidence in the 
judicial process. 
How do my Republican colleagues ex-
pect ordinary citizens to respect and 
trust the courts in civil and criminal 
matters all across this country? Think 
about that as you make this decision. 
Vote ‘‘yes’’ on the Articles of Im-
peachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD.) 
Ms. 
ROYBAL-ALLARD. 
Madam 
Speaker, I take no joy in voting to im-
peach President Trump, but this Presi-
dent has blood on his hands in the 
wake of this attempted coup. 
The fact remains, no President of the 
United States is above the law, and 
this President has sadly violated his 
oath to support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against 
all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
As Members of Congress who have 
taken that same pledge, it is our duty 
to take this action and impeach this 
unfit and dangerous President. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
KHANNA). 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I am 
voting to impeach because, as Lincoln 
said, no grievance is a fit object of re-
dress by mob law. 
But we must recognize that our hard 
work begins when we address the real 
grievances and despair in left-behind 
communities. To be worthy of this Cap-
itol that we hold sacred, to fix our bro-
ken windows and broken communities, 
let’s finally commit to investing tril-
lions 
in 
creating 
good 
jobs 
in 
healthcare, in education, and in infra-
structure for communities and places 
that are hurting. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. SE-
WELL). 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to support impeachment. 
I do so with a heavy heart and a last-
ing and searing memory of being in 
this gallery, the people’s House, right 
up there, fearing for my life. And why? 
Because the President of the United 
States incited others to be violent—a 
mob of insurgents in this House. 
It is unacceptable. It led to the kill-
ing of five Americans. Blood is on this 
House. We must do something about it. 
I ask that we move from ‘‘stopping 
the steal’’ to healing. But healing re-
quires accountability, and everyone 
must be accountable. 
I will be voting to impeach, and I 
urge others to vote for impeachment. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Alabama (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I am fairly new here. Actu-
ally, this is my first floor speech. But 
I rise to oppose this impeachment. 
I asked my staff this morning, how 
many times in our Nation’s history 
have we impeached a President? Well, 
they said, up until this President, only 
two times in our Nation’s history. 
So here we are, 7 days left in his first 
term, and we are going to impeach a 
President. For what reasons? For what 
reasons? There have been no hearings. 
There have been no committees. 
We must defend the right and protect 
the process of impeachment. If we pur-
sue this, from now on, from this day 
forward, impeachment will always be a 
political process. 
I ask my friends across the aisle— 
they always talk about healing—heal-
ing. How do we come together as a na-
tion? 
Since 2016, there have been hashtags 
going around in our Nation that said, 
‘‘Not our President,’’ ‘‘Resist, resist.’’ 
Members across the aisle have said 
things in public to have supporters of 
this President attacked and demeaned. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
last Friday, I sent a letter to my con-
stituents telling the story about the 
violent attack on our Capitol Building, 
which is really like the temple of our 
democracy. 
I have now taken the oath of office, 
the same oath of office that the Presi-
dent of the United States has taken, 
that all of us here have taken, and he 
has been the orchestrator of this at-
tack. 
It is time to hold this President ac-
countable. It is time, and history de-
mands that we impeach Donald Trump 
a second time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES). 
Mr. HIMES. The words have almost 
all been said. Search your soul. Con-
sider your oath. And I add four more 
words: Reflect on your legacy. 
My friends, which way is history 
flowing right now? Will Donald Trump 
join the pantheon of Washington, Lin-
coln, Roosevelt, and Reagan? Will his 
33 percent approval ratings and the 
condemnation 
of 
principled 
Repub-
licans consign him to the heap of re-
viled demigods with Joseph McCarthy 
and Andrew Johnson? 
Where he goes in history, you go in 
history, unless, today, you make a 
stand. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. I would 
like to remind Members to please ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. KAHELE). 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, as a 
member of our Armed Forces, now a 
Member of Congress, I have taken and 
given the oath of office many times. I 
will support and defend the Constitu-
tion against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic. 
On January 6, the President violated 
his oath, inciting violent and deadly 
insurrection. Our sacred oaths are hol-
low without accountability. We must 
hold this President accountable, re-
move him from office, and ensure he 
can never hold public office again. 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
This oath has to matter. Mahalo. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. I yield 30 seconds to 
the 
distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland (Mr. SARBANES). 
Mr. SARBANES. Madam Speaker, 
this beautiful Capitol dome is a symbol 
of freedom and democracy, not just for 
Americans but for people the world 
over. The action we take today, this 
impeachment, is a declaration to the 
world that when there is an attack on 
our democracy, whether it comes from 
without or whether, tragically, in this 
instance, it comes from within, we will 
respond to that threat and attack, and 
we will do what is necessary to 
strengthen our democracy. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
ZELDIN). 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I am 
sickened and angered by what we all 
had to witness last Wednesday and call 
for the investigation and prosecution, 
to the fullest extent of the law, of 
every single person who participated in 
the violence and loss of life in this Cap-
itol Building last Wednesday. 
I, as a Member sitting here, listening 
to the entire debate, desperately need 
to better understand the two standards 
that are at play in this House. Why is 
it okay if a House Democrat calls for 
violence in the streets but not if you 
are a Republican? Why can a House 
Democrat be rewarded with a gavel and 
a chairmanship if they are calling for 
physical confrontation of a Trump ad-
ministration official, but they will be 
punished if they are a Republican? 
The double standards that we have 
seen time and time again, I need to 
better understand what the rules are of 
this House. Why is it that a committee 
chairman can lie to the American pub-
lic 
about 
having 
more 
than 
cir-
cumstantial evidence that the Presi-
dent colluded with the Russians in 
order to win the 2016 election? But, of 
course, 
the Republicans can’t and 
wouldn’t lie to the American public 
about something like that. 
We need to better understand what 
these two standards are that are at 
play and to complete the record be-
cause the House Democrats are here to 
make President Trump the first Presi-
dent to be impeached twice. So, I will 
complete the record. 
First off, in the Article of Impeach-
ment, it is written that the President 
gave a speech and told his supporters 
to come here, and he incited this riot. 
One speaker after another after an-
other here on the other side of the aisle 
repeated that in the Article of Im-
peachment. 
We all know that this was their 
preplanned attack. We all know that 
there were pipe bombs being discovered 
while the President was speaking. We 
all know that the Capitol perimeter 
was being breached during the Presi-
dent’s speech. 
We know that this was preplanned, 
and it started while the President was 
speaking. Why is that not in the Arti-
cle of Impeachment? Why is that not 
being incorporated into my colleagues’ 
remarks to complete the record, if you 
want to make the President the first 
President to be impeached twice? 
Well, we will add something else to 
that. Thank you to the President for 
his efforts to defeat MS–13 in my dis-
trict. Thank you to the President for 
his efforts to move the Embassy in 
Israel to Jerusalem and recognize 
Israeli sovereignty over the Golan 
Heights, to take out Abu Bakr al- 
Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani, to 
eliminate the ISIS caliphate, to enter 
into the historic Abraham Accords, to 
have an economy this time last year 
that was stronger than I ever remem-
ber in my entire lifetime. 
Yes, we will complete the record, and 
in all fairness, as the President leaves 
1 week from today, let’s be honest 
about the double standards that exist 
inside this Chamber. Let’s also be hon-
est that this President did a lot to 
make America greater than ever. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. CASTEN). 
Mr. CASTEN. What happens if we get 
this wrong is written in Lincoln’s sec-
ond inaugural, when one party would 
‘‘make war rather than let the Nation 
survive.’’ 
On September 11, we came together 
against an enemy without. On January 
6, we were attacked by an enemy from 
within, the President who would make 
war with malice for all and charity for 
none. 
We must come together in unity 
today against that domestic threat to 
our Constitution. The alternative is 
too unbearable to contemplate. 
We 
must 
impeach 
bipartisanly, 
unanimously if you have the soul. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Mrs. FLETCH-
ER). 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Article of 
Impeachment and in opposition to the 
gaslighting that is masquerading as de-
bate in this Chamber today. 
I was in this Chamber when the 
President assembled and unleashed a 
mob to attack the United States Cap-
itol and the United States Congress, 
the elected representatives of the peo-
ple. By doing so, he incited an insurrec-
tion against our representative democ-
racy itself. 
If that is not an impeachable offense, 
then what is? 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Ms. 
TLAIB). 
Ms. 
TLAIB. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
in 
Michigan’s 13th, we proudly speak 
truth to power, even in the face of a 
racist in chief. 
Those who incited an attack on the 
people’s House do not get to talk about 
healing and unity. They have torn this 
country apart. They have stoked the 
fire and then handed the gasoline to 
Donald Trump. 
Dr. King once said: ‘‘True peace is 
not merely the absence of tension; it is 
the presence of justice.’’ 
Today, we must embody those words, 
and we must understand that peace 
must be centered in truth and action. 
We cannot, Madam Speaker, sit idly 
by after a violent attempted coup and 
allow lies and hate to continue. Today, 
we stand up for our constituents, who 
continue to be harmed by Donald 
Trump. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 33⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
North Dakota (Mr. ARMSTRONG). 
Mr. ARMSTRONG. Madam Speaker, 
what happened last Wednesday is an 
absolute tragedy. Not only are we part 
of dealing with it now, we were part of 
it then. 
When emotions are frayed and ten-
sions are this high, process matters 
more. It matters more now than it did

before, and the reality is this. There 
are serious constitutional questions 
about these articles. 
Donald Trump is going to be Presi-
dent until January 20, and on January 
20, Joe Biden is going to become Presi-
dent. 
But I am going to vote against im-
peachment, and that is going to give 
me credibility at home with my base. 
You are going to vote for impeach-
ment, and that is going to give you 
credibility at home with your base. It 
is easy to point at me and blame me. It 
is easy for me to point at you and 
blame you. 
But on January 21, we are all going 
to be back here. So use that credi-
bility. Go back and talk some hard 
truths to your people. I am going to do 
it. 
And we need to do a better job. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, this 
President has repeatedly lied to the 
American people about his election 
loss. He incited his followers to attack 
our 
democracy, 
resulting 
in 
five 
deaths. His dangerous efforts to derail 
the peaceful transition of power were a 
violation of his oath of office. This 
President is unfit to lead our Nation 
and unable to discharge his duties of 
office. 
I call upon my Republican colleagues 
to speak the truth to their supporters 
and join me in holding President 
Trump accountable by voting to im-
peach. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Indiana (Mr. MRVAN). 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, since 
the events on January 6, I spoke with a 
group of ministers from Gary, Indiana. 
They told me how they are praying for 
unity and justice in our Nation. 
It reminded me of the moment when 
those of us who were on the House floor 
on January 6 were huddled together in 
a secure room after the attack. House 
Chaplain Kibben led us all in prayer. 
Let us remember that moment. Let 
us rekindle that prayer for those 3 min-
utes when we were all united to pre-
serve our democracy and justice. 
I support the Article of Impeachment 
so that we can move forward to do the 
work that our constituents sent us 
here to do. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do we have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 23⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON). 
Mr. 
MOULTON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there are more troops right now in 
Washington, D.C., than in Afghanistan. 
They are here to defend us against the 
Commander in Chief, the President of 
the United States, and his mob. 
I would ask my colleagues to look at 
the faces of those young Americans de-
fending democracy, defending us, and 
find an ounce of their courage to do the 
right thing, as several Republicans 
have, and take a tough vote for the fu-
ture of democracy, for the future of our 
country. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. VEASEY). 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, let’s 
be clear about one thing. If we were on 
the eve of a Republican President being 
sworn in and his Democratic prede-
cessor had said the same thing that 
this President said and incited his fol-
lowers, his mob, to descend upon the 
Capitol, we would be joining them, not 
making comparisons. Because guess 
what? I don’t care about no base. 
I care about this democracy and this 
country, and what happened the other 
day should never happen again. We 
need to stand up and do the right 
thing. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, the 
Republican whip is prepared to close 
for us whenever that is appropriate. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
b 1530 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I was on that floor just 1 week ago. So, 
today, the insurrectionist in chief will 
be impeached for insurrection. 
It is because he failed to defend this 
Nation against all enemies, domestic 
and foreign. And he stood down near 
the White House and told a mob of do-
mestic terrorists to go and show your 
strength, be strong, you can’t gain any-
thing because of weakness. 
We must hold him accountable. We 
can heal this Nation, but he must be 
impeached today. We must impeach 
Donald J. Trump as an insurrectionist. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, as the descendant of patriotic 
and heroic veterans who risked their lives to 
defend our nation and our freedoms, as a par-
ent with the fervent hope and determination to 
pass on this great democracy to the next gen-
eration, and as a citizen of the greatest repub-
lic in world history, I rise in strong support of 
H. Res. 24, a resolution impeaching the cur-
rent President of the United States for High 
Crimes and Misdemeanors, warranting his 
conviction and removal from office and, in ac-
cordance with Article I, Section 3, clause 7, 
disqualification from ever again holding and 
enjoying an Office of honor, Trust or Profit 
under the United States.’’ 
I strongly support the impeachment and re-
moval of this President because after the hor-
rifying events of Wednesday last, January 6, 
2021, another day that will live in infamy, the 
continuance in office of this President for even 
one moment longer represents a clear and 
present threat to the security of the United 
States, its people, institutions, and democratic 
form of government. 
To put it in the words of the Framers, the 
current President’s conduct reflects and re-
veals a person ‘‘whose character is thus 
marked by every act which may define a ty-
rant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.’’ 
To put it in contemporary terms, the current 
President can rightly be said to be perhaps 
the leading cause of state-sponsored domestic 
terrorism. 
Every minute this President remains in of-
fice represents a minute of maximum peril to 
the American people and the American Exper-
iment. 
Unrepentant after his perfidious and treach-
erous conduct of Wednesday last, the Presi-
dent just yesterday went to Alamo, Texas, 
without giving any advance notice or consulta-
tion to the leaders of that community. 
Does anyone really doubt that the Presi-
dent’s true purpose in going to Alamo was to 
signal to his band of disloyalists his desire that 
they make a last stand and fight to the death 
in his name? 
I do not, and neither does the majority of 
the American people, and I suspect that in 
their heart of hearts, neither do our colleagues 
on the Republican side. 
Madam Speaker, three facts demonstrate 
why immediate action to remove the President 
is essential. 
First, the abject failure and refusal of the 
President to take care that the laws be faith-
fully executed puts lives at risk. 
When the U.S. Capitol was besieged last 
week by domestic terrorists, the President ob-
structed and denied the request of the Mayor 
of the District Columbia to call out the National 
Guard to protect life and property; it took the 
Vice-President, working with Speaker PELOSI 
and incoming Senate Majority Leader SCHU-
MER to prevail upon the Department of De-
fense to come to the defense of Capitol and 
the people trapped inside. 
Instead of acting in accordance with his sa-
cred oath to preserve, protect, and defend the 
Constitution and to take care that the people 
and property of the United States are pro-
tected against all enemies, foreign or domes-
tic, the President did nothing but watch the 
mayhem on television, ebullient at the display 
of support from his lawless loyalists. 
Second, the current President’s conduct 
stands in stark and marked contrast to his 
conduct earlier this year when protests were 
sweeping the country in response to the mur-
der of George Floyd, when the President dis-
patched law enforcement authorities to put 
down peaceful protests led by moms and vet-
erans in Portland, Oregon and social justice 
activists in Washington, D.C. 
Back then, the President mobilized a heavy 
police presence, many on horseback and oth-
ers using tear gas, to clear Lafayette Square 
of peaceful protesters so he could walk across 
the street to have himself photographed 
clutching a bible upside down in front of a 
church. 
Third, the President’s words, actions, and 
conduct betray a contempt and hostility to the 
national value of equal justice under law, tell-
ing the domestic terrorists, nearly all of whom 
were white and who support him politically, 
who stormed the Capitol to derail Congress 
from completing its constitutionally required 
duty of counting and verifying the votes of

presidential electors, that ‘‘we love you. You’re 
very special,’’ while referring to African Ameri-
cans and other persons of color protesting so-
cial injustice and inequalities in the criminal 
justice system as ‘‘animals,’’ ‘‘thugs,’’ and ‘‘an-
archists.’’ 
Madam Speaker, the President’s actions in-
citing insurrection against the United States 
was the proximate cause of the horrifying 
siege of the U.S. Capitol, the destruction and 
desecration of the Citadel of Democracy, and 
the deaths of at least six persons, one of 
whom was a uniformed officer to the United 
States Capitol Police, who was bludgeoned to 
death by the incited mob. 
Abusing the powers and resources of his 
high office, Donald John Trump has actively 
and continuously endeavored to undermine 
the essential institutions and foundations of a 
democratic system of government in the 
United States, engaging in a long train of 
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably 
the same object, evincing a design to make 
himself an authoritarian ruler unaccountable 
to, and independent of, the people of the 
United States. 
The utter unfitness of the President for the 
office he holds and his contempt for the sa-
cred oath he took before the nation with God 
as his witness, was vividly on display on Janu-
ary 6, 2021. 
But signs of his calumny were on display in 
plain sight, reflected by his misbehavior and 
malfeasance from the earliest days of his ad-
ministration. 
Abusing the powers and resources of his 
high office, this President has actively and 
continuously endeavored to undermine the es-
sential institutions and foundations of a demo-
cratic system of government in the United 
States, engaging in a long train of abuses and 
usurpations, pursuing invariably the same ob-
ject, evincing a design to make himself an au-
thoritarian ruler unaccountable to, and inde-
pendent of, the people of the United States 
by: 
(1) Soliciting and welcoming the assistance 
of a hostile foreign power to aid him in secur-
ing election in 2016 as President of the United 
States; 
(2) Refusing to acknowledge Russian inter-
ference in the internal affairs of the United 
States, and then opposing responses by Con-
gress and the Executive Branch to protect the 
national security and interests of the United 
States against future Russian interference and 
aggression. (3) Publicly conveying his interest 
and willingness to accept the assistance of 
foreign powers in his attempt win reelection as 
President of the United States; 
(4) Refusing continuously to acknowledge to 
the American people that he would accept and 
be bound by the verdict rendered in the 2020 
Presidential election, instead claiming that any 
outcome in which he was not declared the 
winner was fraudulent, rigged, and illegitimate; 
(5) Taking active measures to impede and 
undermine the ability of American citizens to 
convey their disapproval of his continuance in 
office by exercising their rights as voters, in-
cluding misusing the United States Postal 
Service to prevent the timely delivery of mail- 
in ballots; 
(6) Instituting frivolous lawsuits to overturn 
the results of the 2020 Presidential election, 
falsely alleging wide-spread voting fraud but 
producing no evidence in support of his spu-
rious allegations; 
(7) Exhorting and inciting his supporters to 
believe falsely that victory in the 2020 Presi-
dential election had been stolen from him and 
that constitutionally required Joint Meeting of 
Congress for the purpose of counting the 
votes of electors and announcement of the re-
sult by the President of the Senate was illegit-
imate and intended to complete the theft of his 
victory; and 
(8) Failing to take action to protect and de-
fend Federal officers and personnel, property, 
buildings, and institutions on January 6, 2021, 
at the U.S. Capitol that was besieged by sup-
porters of Donald John Trump, resulting in ex-
tensive damage to the property of the United 
States and the deaths of at least four persons. 
This is why multiple Members of Congress, 
introduced resolutions of articles of impeach-
ment; joined by dozens of original cosponsors, 
I introduced H. Res. 26, impeaching the Presi-
dent for the High Crimes and Misdemeanors 
of (1) Abuse of Power and (2) Willful Refusal 
And Failure To Protect And Defend The Con-
stitution Of The United States. 
Madam Speaker, Donald John Trump has 
acted in a manner contrary to his trust as 
President and subversive of constitutional gov-
ernment, to the great prejudice of the cause of 
law and justice, and to the manifest injury of 
the people of the United States. 
He must be impeached, convicted, removed 
from office, and disqualified from ever again 
holding and enjoying an Office of honor, Trust 
or Profit under the United States. 
My love and reverence for the Constitution 
compels me to vote to impeach this President 
and I urge all my colleagues who revere the 
Constitution and our democracy, which has 
endured for more than 240 years, to join me 
in voting for H. Res. 24, impeaching Donald 
John Trump again for High Crimes and Mis-
demeanors against the United States. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Repub-
lican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, our Nation still 
mourns the unacceptable violence and 
anarchy that took place in this Capitol 
last week. As we speak, arrests are still 
being made, and the anarchists who 
stormed our Capitol are being brought 
to justice, as should be the case. 
Emotions are still high, but in this 
moment, we need to be focused on 
toning down the rhetoric and helping 
heal this Nation as we move toward a 
peaceful transition of power to Presi-
dent-elect Joe Biden next week. 
My prayers, Madam Speaker, are still 
with Capitol Police Officers Sicknick 
and Liebengood, who we lost, as well as 
all the Capitol Police officers who 
risked their lives to keep us safe. They 
are true heroes, and they deserve all of 
our applause today. 
Madam Speaker, I have seen the dark 
evil of political violence firsthand, and 
it needs to stop. But all of us need to 
be unequivocal in calling it out every 
single time we see it, not just when it 
comes from the other side of the aisle. 
I oppose this rushed impeachment 
brought forward without a single hear-
ing. By the way, the Senate will not 
even take this up until President 
Trump is out of office, so let’s keep 
that in mind. It will only serve to fur-
ther divide a Nation that is calling out 
for healing. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
many 
speakers 
today have invoked one of our Nation’s 
greatest leaders, President Abraham 
Lincoln. Maybe we should follow some 
of Lincoln’s wisdom that he has im-
parted upon us in moments like this. 
As Abraham Lincoln was giving his 
second inaugural address in March 1865, 
Lincoln issued us a challenge. This is 
what he said: ‘‘With malice toward 
none, with charity for all, with firm-
ness in the right, as God gives us to see 
the right, let us strive on to finish the 
work we are in, to bind up the Nation’s 
wounds, to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle and for his widow and 
his orphan, to do all which may 
achieve and cherish a just and a lasting 
peace among ourselves and with all na-
tions.’’ 
Madam Speaker, in times like these, 
let us not reach out to our darkest de-
mons, but instead, like Lincoln, seek 
the higher ground. May God bless this 
great United States of America. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, we 
can have all of this, but we have to 
have accountability, too. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), our distinguished majority 
leader of the House. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
This is a troubled time, a sad time. It 
is a time where all of us have stood al-
most to a person and lamented the vio-
lence and the assault on this Capitol 
and the assault on democracy itself. 
It was right to do that. But this im-
peachment ought to be put in the per-
spective of what the Republican chair 
of the Republican Conference said it 
was. She said the President of the 
United States summoned the mob, as-
sembled the mob, and lit the flame of 
that attack. There has never been, she 
said, a greater betrayal by a President 
of the United States of his office and 
his oath to the Constitution. 
That is why we are here today. That 
is why we are here today just a week 
before that President, at the request of 
the American people, will leave office. 
The issue is, what do we, the 433 of 
us, I believe, who are here, do on behalf 
of the American people to respond to 
what Representative CHENEY described 
that happened on the 6th of January: a 
mob assembled by, summoned by, and 
then spoken to, to light the flame of 
the attack. 
To ‘‘stop the steal,’’ as we sat here, 
exercising our constitutional duty. And 
to his great credit, the Vice President 
of the United States followed the Con-
stitution of the United States of Amer-
ica, notwithstanding the fact that he 
was opportuned by the President not to 
do so. That mob sent by the President 
to ‘‘stop the steal’’ did so for a few 
hours, not the ‘‘steal’’ but the constitu-
tional duty that we had.

January 13, 2021 
So, we ask ourselves, what do we do? 
What 
is 
our 
responsibility? 
What 
should we say in light of only the Civil 
War as an analogy? 
That doesn’t mean there haven’t 
been demonstrations in Washington be-
fore and demonstrations throughout 
this country before. But it is the first 
and only physical presence, other than 
the 9/11 attack, on this Nation, which 
came from abroad and had a plane 
aimed at our Capitol dome. 
This attack was not from abroad. It 
was, as LIZ CHENEY said, summoned, 
assembled, and inflamed by the Presi-
dent of the United States of America. 
In LIZ CHENEY’s words, there has never 
been a greater betrayal by a President 
of the United States of his office and 
his oath to the Constitution. 
I pride myself as a Member of this 
Congress who for 40 years has worked 
in a bipartisan fashion with many of 
your leaders and do to this day. But are 
we to remain silent in the face of LIZ 
CHENEY saying this was the greatest 
betrayal of the duty of the President of 
the United States in history? Are we to 
stand silent? Will we stand silent? Will 
we not stand up and say this is not ac-
ceptable? 
Madam Speaker, for 4 years, Donald 
Trump has made no efforts to hide his 
ambitions or his lacking of Republican 
principles—not our principles, but the 
principles that Abraham Lincoln was 
just quoted as having said. Your Presi-
dent, our President, has never dis-
played those in the 4 years he has been 
President of the United States. 
He has allowed little constraint on 
his worst inclinations. His desire for 
autocracy and his glorification of vio-
lence have not been tempered but 
rationalized by those who sought to 
profit financially and politically from 
their proximity to power. 
Upon the foundations of virtue, rea-
son, and patient wisdom laid down by 
George Washington as our first Presi-
dent, Donald Trump has constructed a 
glass palace of lies, fearmongering, and 
sedition. Last Wednesday, on January 
6, the Nation and the world watched it 
shatter to pieces. 
There can be no mistaking any 
longer the kind of man sitting in the 
Oval Office or his intentions and capa-
bilities. The curtain has been pulled 
back. The office to which he was elect-
ed could not temper or reform him. 
Washington’s legacy was passed down 
to us, not as written decrees but under-
stood norms, how we ought to act, how 
we ought to conduct ourselves. 
Term after term, each occupant has 
observed those norms out of a recogni-
tion that our Constitution’s Articles 
are not the only preservative of our de-
mocracy. For more than two centuries, 
Madam Speaker, whenever those norms 
were tested and strained, good and vir-
tuous citizens on both sides of the aisle 
found common purpose in reaffirming 
those norms. But memory fades, and 
from time to time, it must be re-
freshed. 
Madam Speaker, as the Framers 
emerged from the Constitutional Con-
vention, Benjamin Franklin was asked 
whether they had made America a 
monarchy or a republic. Probably all of 
us know his response. A republic, he 
answered, if you can keep it. 
That is the question today, if we can 
keep it. And the way we keep it is to 
say no to actions and words that do not 
promote the keeping of that republic. 
For millennia, people have under-
stood that a republic is only as stable 
and lasting as the citizens and leaders 
who commit themselves to its upkeep. 
This President has shown us he is not 
committed to that project. His tweets 
every day have shown he is not com-
mitted to that project. Indeed, he open-
ly disdains it and appears to prefer the 
alternative. 
b 1545 
But what of the rest of us, those of us 
who have the honor and the great 
privilege and the weighty responsi-
bility to represent the views of 750,000 
of our fellow citizens? 
We, in this Congress, have an oppor-
tunity—no—a duty to demonstrate our 
commitment both as leaders and as 
citizens to keeping America a republic 
that 
resolves 
its 
differences, 
not 
through being ordered to come to the 
Capitol to prevent them from stealing 
the election, which was an absurd as-
sertion from the very first day it was 
made. 
We cannot erase the last 4 years, 
Madam Speaker. We cannot turn back 
the clock, but we can look to the ideals 
and principles inherited from great 
Presidents like Washington; like Jef-
ferson; and, yes, certainly like Abra-
ham Lincoln; and like Franklin Roo-
sevelt. And from outstanding Ameri-
cans like Frederick Douglass; Harriet 
Tubman; Susan Anthony; Cesar Cha-
vez; Martin Luther King; Thurgood 
Marshall; our beloved John Lewis; and, 
yes, RBG, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who 
all taught us a lot about equality and 
inclusion. 
Madam Speaker, it is up to us to re-
store the vibrancy of our democracy by 
reaffirming our commitment to the 
norms they passed onto us and en-
trusted to our care. But to make that 
possible, Madam Speaker, we must rise 
to this moment and not only affirm the 
virtues we cherish, but reject the vices 
we abhor. That is what I am asking my 
fellow Representatives on both sides of 
the aisle to do today. 
We all stood and we abhorred the vio-
lence that occurred and the threat to 
the very democracy that we hold so 
dear and that we swore an oath to pro-
tect and uphold. Reject deceit. Reject 
fear-mongering. Reject sedition, tyr-
anny, and insurrection. Reject the de-
mand for fealty to one man over fidel-
ity to one’s country. 
When I addressed the House during 
the debate over the Articles of Im-
peachment in December of 2019, I said 
the following: We need not ask who 
will be the first to show our courage by 
standing up to President Trump. The 
question we must ask: Who will be the 
last to find it? 
Senator MCCONNELL, Representative 
CHENEY, and a number of other Rep-
resentatives who have spoken on this 
floor 
with 
great 
courage, 
Madam 
Speaker, because there is much fear of 
Donald Trump. There is much fear of 
Donald Trump’s tweets. There is much 
fear of Donald Trump’s retribution for 
opposition. In my view, Donald Trump 
demands absolute loyalty and gives 
none in return. 
I hope others will join LIZ CHENEY. I 
hope others will be honest with them-
selves and with their constituents as 
LIZ CHENEY was, saying, ‘‘There has 
never been a greater betrayal of a 
President of the United States to his 
office and to his oath to the Constitu-
tion.’’ 
Don’t dismiss that. She is the daugh-
ter of a Vice President of the United 
States, who was the whip when I came 
to Congress. As she has taken a stand, 
I hope others will as well, Madam 
Speaker. 
Soon, the Clerk will call the roll and 
ask for our votes. Make no mistake, 
this will be no ordinary roll call. This 
is about our country, our Constitution, 
and our democracy. These votes will be 
inscribed on the roll of history, a 
record of courage and of our commit-
ment to country and Constitution, of 
our commitment to the rule of law and 
renewal of that which we inherited and 
hope to pass on unbroken, unshattered. 
With just 7 days left in the Presi-
dent’s term, this vote is not about tim-
ing. It is about principle and fidelity to 
our Constitution. It concerns the clear 
and present danger facing our country 
not only in these final days of the 
Trump administration, but 
in 
the 
weeks, months, and years that will fol-
low. It is about the necessity to dem-
onstrate to this generation and to fu-
ture generations the duty we share to 
protect our democracy every single 
day. 
Do not pretend, my friends, that it 
was simply those who came into the 
Capitol, encouraged by our President 
to ‘‘stop the steal’’ at any cost. 
By the way, if the Vice President 
doesn’t do my bidding and follows the 
Constitution, sweep him away. 
We know that this President would 
never emulate George Washington and 
give up his power for the good of our 
Republic, even after losing an election. 
Somebody talked about a peaceful 
transition. There has not been a peace-
ful transition. I don’t know what you 
are talking about. You are not living in 
the same country I am. It was just days 
ago that the President, after commit-
ting this terrible act, thought he had 
to admit that Joe Biden might, yes, be 
President of the United States. 
We know that this President neither 
recognizes norms, nor reflects the rule 
of law. We know that this President is 
not a patriot. 
Madam Speaker, so I ask this House: 
Who among us will be recorded on the 
roll of history for their courage, their 
commitment to the Constitution, and 
their country?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H187 
January 13, 2021 
We do this today not for politics. We 
don’t need this for politics. Georgia 
showed that. There was no mistake in 
this election. We do this today to pre-
serve and protect this great democ-
racy. We do it for the America we love, 
our 
America 
the 
beautiful, 
whose 
Founders’ sacrifices we praise in song: 
‘‘O beautiful for heroes proved in liber-
ating strife, who more than self their 
country loved and mercy more than 
life.’’ 
Sadly, Madam Speaker, as our cur-
rent President, the appropriate words 
would be: Who less than self his coun-
try loved and victory more than truth. 
Vote for this, for America, for our 
Constitution, for democracy, for his-
tory. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of impeaching President Don-
ald Trump for the second time. This is not an 
action I take lightly, but an action I am com-
pelled to take in order to uphold my oath as 
a Member of Congress. President Trump is a 
threat to our nation and in full public view vio-
lated his duties to the Constitution, to our de-
mocracy, and to the American people. 
For months, the president and his enablers 
lied about the election, whipping up misplaced 
anger among his followers. He then encour-
aged his followers to come to Washington for 
a ‘‘wild’’ rally to support overthrowing the elec-
tion results. At the rally, the president contin-
ued to incite his followers, further encouraging 
their anger. Then he pointed down Constitu-
tion Avenue and told his followers to march to 
the U.S. Capitol and unleash their anger on 
Congress. They did, and five people died. 
Make no mistake, the president set the 
stage, invited the audience, and lit the match 
that sparked the deadly insurrection at the 
Capitol. Just as disturbing was his lack of re-
sponse while Congress Members were beg-
ging for him to help, while Capitol Police were 
being beaten and killed, and while his fol-
lowers hunted through the Capitol seeking to 
do harm to Members of Congress and even 
his own Vice President. President Trump has 
abrogated the responsibilities of his office and 
violated his oath to the Constitution. 
Every day he remains in office is another 
chance for him to foment further violence. He 
must be removed now. The House must do its 
duty to protect our nation from the president 
by impeaching him and the Senate must act 
quickly to convict the president and remove 
him from office. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, five peo-
ple died last week, one of them a Capitol Po-
lice Officer who lost his life trying to protect 
us. The attack and the loss of life were the 
culmination of the President’s calls for vio-
lence over the last five years and my col-
leagues’ refusal to hold him accountable. 
I was in the Gallery, and after reflecting on 
the violent attack as a Member of Congress 
and as a former law enforcement officer, it 
baffles me that some of my colleagues on the 
other side would say that today’s vote is a 
‘‘rush to judgement.’’ 
Well, I think it’s the only appropriate re-
sponse to Members of Congress having to 
rush for the doors to escape the violence in-
cited by the President and encouraged by the 
Members of this body. 
Madam Speaker, what happened to Con-
gress? For we now behold mere shadows 
where great men and women once stood. I re-
member my oath and I intend to uphold it. I 
encourage my colleagues to vote in favor of 
this resolution. 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to today’s impeachment resolution, 
H. Res. 24, against President Trump. 
First, it is a tragedy that we are here once 
again with this body, the United States House 
of Representatives, moving forward with im-
peaching President Trump. 
This body impeached the president during 
the 116th Congress which resulted in his ac-
quittal in the Senate. Before President Trump, 
there have only been two presidents im-
peached by the House of Representatives. 
Now, after the majority party in the House 
did not get what they wanted the first time with 
impeachment, they are at it again a second 
time. 
Their blind hatred of the President and four 
years of denying the results of the election 
have led them to one final moment of doing 
this again. 
This impeachment is being held in the court 
of public opinion. I have found no constitu-
tional grounding for President Trump’s im-
peachment. 
If Democratic leadership wanted us to take 
their stunt seriously, the least they could have 
done was attempted to present some sort of 
evidence in a formal trial. 
Make no mistake, this is not the way the 
House should be conducting business. 
The nation and world have been through a 
global pandemic this past year which has de-
stroyed many small businesses and jobs 
across our county. 
Yet, the House majority leadership could not 
be bothered to compromise on much-needed 
relief. They focused on playing politics with 
people’s lives and making sure the president 
had one less accomplishment on his record 
ahead of the November 2020 election. 
So why is the House spending its time on 
impeachment with H. Res. 24? Simply there 
are many who never liked President Trump, 
never gave him a chance, and have only 
sought to remove him from office since day 
one. 
With just days left before the president 
leaves office, House Democrats have decided 
to implement their double standard yet again. 
Many of my House colleagues from the 
other side of the aisle have spent an incred-
ible amount of energy on fanning the flames of 
political unrest. They have called for riots and 
said peaceful protests are not enough. 
President Trump called for his supporters to 
protest peacefully. When things got out of 
hand, he called on them to stand down and 
listen to law enforcement officials. 
When violent protests got out of hand 
across the country this past summer you did 
not see the same type of condemnation from 
the Democratic Party. 
President Trump has already said there will 
be an orderly transition on January 20, 2021. 
We need to move forward and help to ensure 
that the incoming Biden-Harris administration 
has everything they need to assume office on 
day one. 
We are deeply divided in this country right 
now. 
Impeachment 
without 
constitutional 
grounding does nothing but disenfranchise the 
74 million people that voted for President 
Trump. 
I strongly oppose these impeachment efforts 
in the House and do not wish to create a fur-
ther divide in our country. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, Donald Trump 
is an immediate threat to our Constitution and 
to our Democracy. He must be removed. 
It has now been a week since rampaging 
criminals incited by Mr. Trump invaded and 
vandalized the Capitol—the heart of American 
Democracy and government. The attack re-
sulted in six deaths—including that of two po-
lice officers—and left an indelible stain on our 
nation. With each passing day, we learn more 
about the extent to which this attack was 
planned and orchestrated. 
This was a violent insurrection—not a 
peaceful protest. The criminals who per-
petrated this attack were inspired, directed, 
and encouraged by Donald Trump and his lies 
and incited by several members of Congress, 
all of whom have refused to acknowledge—let 
alone take responsibility for—their roles in this 
shameful episode. 
No action we take today can undo the dese-
cration caused by Donald Trump, the mem-
bers of Congress who aided and abetted him, 
and those dangerous insurrectionists. This 
was not merely a criminal conspiracy; it was 
an attack on our nation’s Capitol to delib-
erately and violently overthrow the duly elect-
ed Government of the United States. 
Regardless of our actions today, Donald 
Trump will be removed from office in just over 
a week. But that does not mean we shouldn’t 
act. If we let an insurgence against our gov-
ernment go without consequence, what will we 
be saying to future generations? 
We must send the permanent message that 
in January of 2021, Congress refused to con-
done, pardon, or ignore this crime against the 
Constitution and the American people, and fur-
ther, that Congress refused the possibility that 
Donald Trump could ever hold office again. 
Some have said that this should be a time 
for unity, not for divisiveness. I agree. We 
must be united and unequivocal in our dec-
laration: The desecration of our Democracy 
will not be tolerated. The divisiveness over this 
issue is not being caused by those of us who 
insist on upholding the Constitution and rule of 
law; the responsibility for discord belongs sole-
ly at the feet of those who refuse to do so. 
Therefore, I must call out those in this body 
who continue to perpetuate the lies that led to 
this deadly chain of events. American Democ-
racy was and remains threatened by their ac-
tions and words. Over the last four years, we 
have learned that the guardrails constructed 
by our Founders to protect the Constitution 
are only as strong as the leaders who take the 
oath to defend them. When our elected offi-
cials take steps to undermine democracy—as 
far too many here today have done—the fabric 
and future of our great nation is endangered. 
All of us have sworn an oath to protect 
America from its enemies, both foreign and 
domestic. Today, that oath requires each and 
every one of us to support the immediate im-
peachment of Donald Trump. History will 
judge us all for our decision today. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, just over a 
year ago, I stood on the House floor as we did 
our jobs and voted to impeach the President 
of the United States. The facts were clear 
then: Donald Trump abused the power of the 
Office of the Presidency to pursue his own 
personal, political gain. My vote was a vote for 
the Constitution and for ‘We, the People’ be-
cause America is so deeply worth it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H188 
January 13, 2021 
Six months later, we saw Donald Trump’s 
radically disparate treatment of a violent mob 
taking over the Michigan state capitol while 
threatening to lynch a governor and the harsh 
crackdown on Black, Indigenous, and people 
of color demonstrating for civil and human 
rights in the wake of yet another Black person 
being murdered by law enforcement. On the 
one hand, we saw armed white men with 
swastikas and Confederate flags threatening 
lawmakers, damaging the statehouse, and 
seeking to lynch, shoot, and behead the Gov-
ernor of Michigan with no federal response. In 
fact, Attorney General Bill Barr told me under 
oath that he wasn’t even aware it occurred. In 
sharp contrast, we saw Black people and peo-
ple of color forcibly removed by armed federal 
officials using pepper bombs and tear gas. 
This time, the Attorney General was on the 
scene himself. 
All of these events brought us to January 6, 
2021. On that day, I was trapped in the House 
gallery for nearly two hours as a mob of insur-
rectionists launched a deadly attack on our 
Capitol, our country, and our democracy. My 
colleagues and I took cover as domestic ter-
rorists waved the confederate flag in the Peo-
ple’s House; as the temple of our democracy 
was ransacked in the most deadly and de-
structive assault on the U.S. Capitol since the 
War of 1812. The events of January 6 were 
horrific. We know now that January 6 could 
have ended in even more violence, harm, and 
loss of life. We know the mob came ready for 
combat with nooses, zip ties, bats, bulletproof 
vests, and pipes. We know they came within 
seconds of breaching the United States Sen-
ate and ran around the inside of this building 
chanting ‘‘Hang Mike Pence’’ and looking for 
our Speaker, NANCY PELOSI. And we know 
that they had placed bombs at the Capitol, the 
Democratic National Committee, and the Re-
publican National Committee. 
Why did they do all of this? Because for 
months, the man who sits in the White House 
has refused to accept the will of the American 
people; has refused to recognize that he lost 
a free and fair election—decisively. And then 
he—and some Republican members of this 
Congress—called on his followers to ‘‘be 
wild.’’ They told them to ‘‘stand by.’’ Then, 
they told them to ‘‘fight like hell.’’ Next, they 
proclaimed ‘‘we are going to the Capitol.’’ The 
insurrectionists followed those orders from the 
President of the United States. They went to 
the Capitol and fought like hell. They tried to 
subvert our democracy, but they failed. 
Donald Trump is the smoking gun. That gun 
is reloaded and whether or not it goes off 
once more is up to us. We must send a clear 
message to the President that the United 
States Congress will not stand by and allow 
one man to turn our democracy into an autoc-
racy; will not stand by while that man incites 
insurrectionists to launch a deadly assault on 
the United States Capitol. 
I call on my colleagues to join me in voting 
to immediately impeach, convict, and remove 
Donald J. Trump from office; to ensure he can 
never run for elected office again; to fight for 
justice; to send a signal to those across Amer-
ica and throughout the world who—incited and 
fueled by this president—want to do us further 
harm; and to hold him fully accountable for 
this attack on Congress, the United States of 
America, and our democracy. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, it is 
the honor of my life to walk into the Capitol 
and onto this House floor to carry the voices 
and values of the people of Illinois’ 14th Con-
gressional District to this hallowed institution. 
The Capitol itself is the global symbol of de-
mocracy, and the Congress that meets here is 
charged with upholding the very first Article of 
our Constitution, written 233 years ago. The 
Capitol is where democratically elected Ameri-
cans from across the country convene to rep-
resent their communities. It truly is—and must 
remain—the People’s House. Last week, the 
People’s House was invaded by people who 
committed acts of terror and desecrated this 
sacred space. 
In the days since the January 6 attack on 
the Congress, hundreds of concerned Illi-
noisans have reached out to my office to 
share messages of disbelief that such an at-
tack was plotted openly yet not prevented; 
messages of anger at the violence and the 
hate that was on display that day, and at the 
elected leaders who capitalized on those sen-
timents; messages of fear for the fragility of 
our democracy. I also received many mes-
sages of support and concern for the safety of 
myself and my staff, which was a great com-
fort to us all, and for which we are immensely 
grateful. 
One of my constituents wrote to me about 
feeling 
‘‘disheartened, 
deeply 
saddened, 
shocked, and angry’’ about the events of Jan-
uary 6 and all that led up to them, and another 
wrote about ‘‘uncertainty and fear.’’ Another 
wrote simply that ‘‘there are no words to de-
scribe my horror.’’ I, too, felt all of those emo-
tions as I watched the attack unfold just be-
yond my office, and moved heavy furniture to 
barricade my office doors. 
One constituent wrote to ask me a question: 
‘‘What will our future look like if we continue 
to allow future U.S. leaders to lead and sup-
port these types of attacks on our democ-
racy?’’ It’s a question that I am asking myself 
today, and that we are all here to answer: 
‘‘What will our future look like?’’ She wrote 
about the need for consequences, not only as 
justice for the perpetrators of this attack, but 
also as a message for posterity. 
Over the past week, we in Congress have 
solemnly considered the most appropriate re-
sponse to the President’s incitement of insur-
rection—an attack that not only cost several 
people their lives, but also threatened a cor-
nerstone of our democracy: the peaceful tran-
sition of power. It is our duty to ensure that 
the perpetrators are held accountable, and 
that no historical sanctuary is granted to those 
who have ignited this fire. We have had to 
face the ugly truth that this attack was incited 
by a President seeking to violently overturn 
the results of a democratic election and reject 
the will of the American people. 
That is why today, we must impeach this 
President. This is an act toward preserving the 
integrity of our democracy. This is a message 
to future Americans about who we are as a 
nation, and who we ought to be. 
Each of us took an oath just days ago, 
pledging to uphold the United States Constitu-
tion against all enemies, foreign and domestic. 
Today I will fulfill that promise by voting in 
favor of the impeachment of President Donald 
J. Trump. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the resolution offer-
ing articles of impeachment against President 
Donald J. Trump. Our country and our Capitol 
have suffered a devastating attack in the past 
week, and the President’s role in inciting the 
violence we experienced has left us no choice 
but to impeach him. 
President Trump, through his words and ac-
tions, encouraged and incited the insurrection 
that occurred on January 6, 2021, when Con-
gress was gathered to certify the results of the 
2020 Presidential election. In the days and 
weeks preceding the deadly attack, President 
Trump made statements, both on social media 
and directly to his supporters, repeating false 
claims that he had won the election and urg-
ing supporters to come to Washington, D.C. 
and ‘‘fight like hell.’’ The morning of January 6, 
he led a rally and sent his supporters to the 
Capitol with the goal of stopping the certifi-
cation of the Electoral College, thwarting the 
will of millions of Americans who voted for Joe 
Biden, and overturning the 2020 Presidential 
election. The events that unfolded that after-
noon were dangerous, terrifying, unprece-
dented, and un-American. Armed domestic 
terrorists stormed the Capitol, leading to sev-
eral deaths, countless injuries, untold property 
damage, and a democracy in crisis. Pipe 
bombs and zip ties were found on and around 
the Capitol grounds. Videos show Capitol Po-
lice officers being beaten by White suprema-
cists. Elected officials in the line of presidential 
succession, including the Vice President and 
the Speaker of the House, were essentially 
hunted by terrorists and forced into hiding. 
The President did not quell the mob; nor did 
he offer any empathy whatsoever to his own 
Vice President or to the hundreds of Senators, 
Representatives, and staff who were at the 
Capitol and traumatized. In the following days, 
Donald Trump failed to take responsibility for 
the direct attack on the country he is respon-
sible for leading and protecting and continued 
to incite insurrection by continuing to perpet-
uate the lie that he won the election. 
We are now forced to reckon with the grave 
reality that the President of the United States 
directly incited an attack on our government 
and country, and he must be held account-
able. He is wholly unfit for office and must 
never be able to serve in government again. 
I commend my colleagues, Representatives 
CICILLINE, LIEU, and RASKIN, for drafting this 
resolution of impeachment. For the sake of 
democracy, the Senate must now follow our 
lead, rise to the occasion, and swiftly convict 
the President of the high crimes and mis-
demeanors he has committed. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support for the resolution to impeach Presi-
dent Trump. 
This is an open and shut case. The facts 
are clear to all who wish to see them. 
In his January 6 speech, Donald Trump in-
cited a vicious assault on the U.S. Capitol with 
the intention of pressuring Vice President 
PENCE and a joint session of Congress into 
overturning the results of the Electoral College 
vote that made Joe Biden president. It’s clear 
he wanted Congress and the Vice President to 
declare him president for a second term de-
spite his losing the election. 
I believe that this was the final act in what 
was a months-long effort to overturn the 2020 
presidential election results so that he could 
remain in office. 
I believe that Donald Trump’s actions on 
January 6 constituted high crimes and mis-
demeanors under the Constitution and there-
fore justify his impeachment. He is clearly

guilty of sedition, and his actions led to the 
loss of five lives that day, including that of a 
Capitol Police officer who was mortally injured 
defending the Capitol, the Congress, and the 
Vice President. 
I also support impeaching him now, even 
though he has just a few days left in office, in 
order to define a standard of acceptable con-
duct for future Presidents—and a precedent to 
deter future presidents from attempting to defy 
the will of the American people. 
Finally, I believe that President Trump 
should be impeached and immediately re-
moved from office because I am concerned 
that, given what he has done to illegally re-
main in office, it is possible, if not highly prob-
able, that he would take further undemocratic 
and criminal actions in the days he has left in 
a desperate bid to thwart the voters’ will. 
Those are the reasons why I cosponsored 
the article of impeachment and why I will vote 
for it today. 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, last 
week’s violent attack on Congress was an act 
of domestic terrorism. The U.S. Capitol build-
ing was desecrated and vandalized. Members 
of Congress, their staff members, and those 
who work in this temple of American democ-
racy were terrorized. The women and men of 
the Capitol Police who work every day to pro-
tect us were beaten. Two officers lost their 
lives as a result of this tragedy. 
Make no mistake, this was a terrorist plot to 
disrupt Congress; to prevent Congress from 
performing its duty under the Constitution to 
certify the results of the Electoral College that 
Joseph R. Biden and KAMALA D. HARRIS will 
be sworn in as President and Vice President 
of the United States on January 20, 2021. 
This domestic terrorist attack was an at-
tempted coup against the United States of 
America by attacking the U.S. Congress and 
the Vice President of the United States MI-
CHAEL R. PENCE. And this coup was inspired, 
encouraged, and supported by Donald J. 
Trump—the deranged and dangerous man 
who currently occupies the White House. 
Today, I will vote to impeach Mr. Trump— 
for the second time—for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. If his actions in inciting the insur-
rection of January 6, 2021 do not warrant im-
peachment and removal by the Congress, 
then truly nothing is worthy of impeachment. 
Congress must protect this nation from Mr. 
Trump and from future Presidents who may 
seek to follow in his dangerous footsteps. We 
must impeach. 
When Mr. Trump leaves the White House 
and is again a private citizen, I strongly urge 
the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate 
and prosecute Mr. Trump for crimes com-
mitted against our democracy and the people 
of the United States. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
with just 7 days remaining in his term, today’s 
highly partisan rush to impeach the President 
is being done without knowing the whole truth 
which takes time, effort and serious scrutiny to 
establish. 
Today’s snap impeachment vote alleging 
President Trump’s ‘‘incitement of insurrection’’ 
lacks an objective and thorough investigation 
of the facts. 
Astonishingly, there have been no congres-
sional hearings on H. Res. 24—the impeach-
ment resolution—which was only introduced 
two days ago on January 11th. 
The fact that the U.S. Senate won’t even 
consider the impeachment resolution passed 
by the House until after the January 20th inau-
guration begs the question as to why the de-
bate and vote isn’t postponed until we have all 
the facts. 
Our Nation is in desperate need of unity and 
civility as it prepares for the inauguration of 
President-elect Biden. 
Impeachment of President Trump—without 
a thorough analysis of the facts which takes 
time, effort and serious scrutiny to establish— 
will not in any way help to heal a divided 
America. 
Let me state again that I unequivocally con-
demn the assault on the Capitol last week and 
those who committed murder, violence, van-
dalism and other crimes should be prosecuted 
to the greatest extent of the law. 
We must be committed to zero-tolerance to-
wards violence in any form. 
I strongly support and have cosponsored 
H.R. 275 to create a national bipartisan com-
mission to comprehensively investigate the 
January 6th deadly attack on the Capitol. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H. Res. 24, impeach-
ing Donald John Trump, President of the 
United States, for high crimes and mis-
demeanors. 
When we consider impeachment, the first 
question to consider is not ‘‘what is an im-
peachable offense?’’ but ‘‘why is impeachment 
in the Constitution?’’ If it is necessary to have 
an elected official removed from office, the 
normal process is to vote him out of office at 
his next election and have him leave when his 
term expires. But there are times when it is 
absolutely not feasible to wait until a term ex-
pires. That is why impeachment is in the Con-
stitution. 
The Constitution says the President ‘‘shall 
be removed from office on impeachment for, 
and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other 
high crimes and misdemeanors.’’ When a 
President is committing treason, it is obviously 
not feasible to wait until the next election and 
the expiration of his term. If a President is 
seeking, taking or giving bribes, it is not fea-
sible to wait. As for ‘‘other high crimes or mis-
demeanors,’’ the important word is ‘‘other,’’ 
because it suggests offenses that have the 
same effect on the nation as treason or brib-
ery. The phrase ‘‘high crimes and mis-
demeanors’’ is intentionally vague, but the 
meaning is clear—behavior that creates a situ-
ation, as in cases of treason and bribery, 
where it is not feasible to wait until the next 
election and the expiration of the President’s 
term. Impeachment is not in the Constitution 
primarily as a punishment, but as a mecha-
nism to protect our democracy when it is not 
feasible to wait until January 20th. 
In that light, we evaluate the President’s re-
cent behavior. 
Shortly before noon on Wednesday, Janu-
ary 6, 2021, President Trump addressed thou-
sands of his supporters, who specifically came 
to Washington at his urging. This event was 
called the ‘‘March to Save America.’’ The 
President’s words and actions at this rally, and 
arguably the lies he spread weeks before, in-
cited a violent insurrection. Soon after the 
President’s speech, a violent mob over-
whelmed the U.S. Capitol with the intent of 
disrupting the counting of the Electoral College 
votes—the final official step in the election of 
the next President of the United States. These 
individuals harbored delusions fostered by the 
President that, but for the grace of God, could 
have resulted in the death or injury of the Vice 
President and many members of Congress. 
During most of this insurrection, the absence 
of the National Guard and other military units 
was conspicuous, especially when compared 
to the overwhelming police and military pres-
ence last summer during racial justice protests 
in the nation’s capital. 
The facts are not in dispute. According to 
Rep. LIZ CHENEY, the third highest ranking Re-
publican in the House of Representatives, 
‘‘The President of the United States sum-
moned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit 
the flame of this attack. Everything that fol-
lowed was his doing. None of this would have 
happened without the President . . . There 
has never been a greater betrayal by a Presi-
dent of the United States of his office and his 
oath to the Constitution.’’ 
Last weekend, the Washington Post pub-
lished audio recordings revealing a conversa-
tion in which the President encourages and at-
tempts to pressure Georgia election officials to 
‘‘find’’ over 11,780 votes to reverse the cer-
tified results of the November 3rd election. 
This hour long recording further supports pre-
vious reports of the President actively attempt-
ing to overturn the will of the voters in other 
states he clearly and fairly lost. 
Additionally, the President has used presi-
dential powers to pardon numerous criminals, 
many of whom were convicted of offenses that 
could have been part of coverups to protect 
the President himself. He should not continue 
to hold this power while insurrectionists are 
being arrested and charged across the coun-
try. And it is also being reported that he is ac-
tively considering additional questionable par-
dons, including for himself and his immediate 
family. 
Notwithstanding his oath to faithfully execute 
the laws, the President is doing nothing to ad-
dress the COVID–19 pandemic, even though 
more than 125,000 deaths have occurred 
since the election. There has been a complete 
abdication of responsibility demonstrated by 
his failure to develop a testing and contact 
tracing strategy, his refusal to encourage the 
use of masks to stop the spread of this deadly 
virus, and now a complete mismanagement of 
vaccine distribution. Furthermore, his execu-
tion of the laws has been compromised by the 
wholesale resignations of senior federal offi-
cials across the executive branch. 
The President has gone to extraordinary 
lengths to disrupt the transition from his ad-
ministration to President-elect Biden, under-
mining our national security. Our nation is fac-
ing economic distress, a raging pandemic, the 
disastrous consequences of climate change, a 
reckoning with racial injustice, and a historic 
cyber intrusion. While our country is facing 
these challenges, the President has chosen to 
jeopardize our national security by refusing the 
incoming administration customary intelligence 
briefings, refusing to concede the election, and 
falsely claiming election fraud ultimately dis-
rupting the peaceful transition of power and 
undermining the incoming administration’s 
ability to manage these crises. 
And there have been ongoing violations of 
the Constitution’s emoluments clause, as for-
eign governments have paid money to Trump 
businesses since his inauguration four years 
ago. 
Each of these behaviors alone would con-
stitute impeachable offenses, so the analysis 
moves to whether or not any or all of them

create the crisis envisioned in the impeach-
ment clause where it is not feasible to wait 
until January 20th to have him removed from 
office. I believe the evidence is overwhelming 
and that we have no choice but to act expedi-
tiously to impeach. 
The attack on the Capitol clearly puts us in 
a situation where it is not feasible to wait until 
the President’s term expires at noon on Janu-
ary 20, 2021. He has shown no remorse for 
the loss of life and the blatant attack he incited 
on one of the greatest symbols of our democ-
racy. There has also been no credible expla-
nation why the Capitol Police were left strand-
ed without the support of the National Guard 
or other law enforcement agencies nor any 
credible explanation why the Attorney General 
nor the Director of the F.B.I. have attended 
any public briefings on what happened on 
January 6, 2021 or what is being done to 
make sure that it does not happen again 
under the President’s leadership. And when a 
person is found unfit to control a Twitter ac-
count, it is hard to imagine how he is fit to 
control the nuclear codes. He is also not fit to 
control the security of the Capitol for the up-
coming inauguration or from other attacks at 
the Capitol that, according to some public re-
ports, are being planned. 
Tragically, tens of thousands of people will 
continue to die unnecessarily because of his 
incompetence and inaction in dealing with the 
COVID–19 pandemic. This self-serving use of 
the presidential pardon power cannot con-
tinue, and if he is removed from office, a proc-
ess can be put in place to seamlessly transi-
tion powers to the Biden Administration with-
out gaps in National Security. 
For these reasons it is imperative that he be 
removed from office now. 
Once impeached, it is true that he may not 
be convicted in the Senate. In fact, an im-
peachment trial may never take place. But the 
fact that a quick trial and conviction could take 
place should deter problematic behavior by 
the President during his last few days in office. 
For example, if Majority Leader MCCONNELL 
received a distressed call from the Secretary 
of Defense explaining that the President had 
issued 
a 
bizarre 
military 
order, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL could quickly summon the Chief 
Justice, reconvene the Senate and vote to re-
move the President within hours of the call. 
Knowing that this could take place would 
hopefully deter the President from issuing 
such an order or granting inappropriate par-
dons. 
The President will be encouraged to resign, 
and the Vice President and a majority of the 
cabinet secretaries could activate the 25th 
amendment. But all the House of Representa-
tives can control is impeachment. The House 
has an obligation to do just that. Our action 
should not be guided by politics or grievance, 
but should reflect the fact that the future of our 
Democracy is our first priority. 
Madam Speaker, we do not want to look up 
on January 20th and see that security at the 
inauguration was mismanaged with disastrous 
results; or witness a blanket pardon to all of 
those involved in the insurrection; or suffer as 
tens of thousands die unnecessarily due to the 
President’s continued mismanagement of the 
pandemic; or witness any other disastrous sit-
uation resulting from the abusive use of presi-
dential powers. And if any of that happens be-
cause he was not impeached by the House 
and convicted and removed by the Senate, we 
cannot say we did not see it coming. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, in 
his speech and subsequent hesitation to swift-
ly react to the violence, the President wrongly 
amplified an emotionally charged environ-
ment—emboldening persons predetermined to 
do violence, adding to a mob frenzy, and over-
shadowing the important policy work of four 
years and those who peacefully stood by him. 
Our objective should be this: Restore peace 
in our country. Restore confidence in our gov-
ernment. Restore decency and decorum. 
In just seven days, Joe Biden will be Presi-
dent. I voted to certify his election. In order to 
begin the process of healing our nation after 
this traumatic moment, we must choose wise-
ly. If we use the blunt instrument of impeach-
ment, we will punish the President but deepen 
the trauma of an America already wracked by 
political violence. The call for accountability 
ought now to be found in the hard slog to re-
build. 
I will vote against impeachment. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
respect for the will of the people, which has 
been expressed through their votes in a valid 
democratic process and the peaceful transfer 
of power between administrations, is the foun-
dation of our Nation. 
Seeing the President incite groups to inter-
rupt that very democratic process, leading 
them to take the U.S. Capitol by force, where 
two members of the Capitol Police died in the 
line of duty, is deeply outrageous. Using force 
as the mechanism to achieve change or ac-
cess to power has no place in the constitu-
tional transfer of office. I have never validated 
that resource to enforce anyone’s opinion. All 
those who perpetrated these acts must be 
held accountable to the fullest extent of the 
law, including the President. 
This Nation needs to heal the deep wound 
created by the acts of domestic terrorism on 
January 6, where at the end of the day de-
mocracy prevailed, Congress continued with 
the processes in which the Vice President vali-
dated the result of the elections in favor of a 
new administration. 
That healing will come in less than a week 
with the transfer of power in an orderly and 
peaceful manner, as mandated by our legal 
system, but past events have caused many, 
including myself, to withdraw our trust in this 
President. 
On past occasions I have rejected the Presi-
dent’s conduct, while on other occasions I 
have recognized the great resources that he 
helped me bring to the Island in a time of 
need. In the same way, my priority continues 
to be defending the interests of the people of 
Puerto Rico and I will always work with any-
one to achieve the betterment of the people I 
represent. 
I swore to defend the Constitution against 
all foreign and domestic enemies. The acts of 
January 6 were an attack on our Constitution, 
they were acts of sedition perpetrated by do-
mestic terrorists and that is why I join my col-
leagues from both parties in supporting an im-
peachment process against the President, 
even though as a Resident Commissioner I 
cannot vote in that process. This will serve as 
an example of the power of our Nation’s de-
mocracy, where no one, including the Presi-
dent, is above the law. 
Ms. WILLIAMS of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, in the words of the late Congressman John 
Lewis, ‘‘When you see something that is not 
right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obli-
gation to say something, to do something.’’ 
Today we must do something and vote to 
impeach President Donald J. Trump. 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of impeachment in order to defend our 
democracy and protect our country from a 
President who poses a clear and present dan-
ger to our republic. Last week, as I was pre-
paring to defend Wisconsin’s election results 
on the House floor during the certification of 
the Electoral College votes, the Nation experi-
enced an attack on our Capitol and demo-
cratic process. What should have been a day 
of celebration as we witnessed the peaceful 
transfer of power—something that makes 
America exceptional in the eyes of the world— 
was marred by a lawless assault on our de-
mocracy. 
It’s of the utmost importance in the coming 
weeks to bring those who perpetrated this vio-
lence to justice. They must be prosecuted to 
the full extent of the law. However, we also 
need to address those that fostered and even 
amplified the toxic climate that allowed this to 
happen in the first place. Undoubtedly, this in-
cludes the President, who openly encouraged 
a mob to march to the Capitol to disrupt 
Congress’s Constitutional role in certifying the 
presidential election and later went so far as 
to say that the rioters were ‘‘very special’’ and 
that he ‘‘loves’’ them. 
Words and actions have consequences. For 
months now, the President and Members of 
Congress have spread lies and unfounded ac-
cusations about the integrity of our election. In 
doing so, they unleashed dark forces in our 
society and even incited a violent mob that at-
tacked the United States Capitol. Lives were 
lost as a result of this insurrection, including 
those of U.S. Capitol Police Officers Brian 
Sicknick and Howard Liebengood. My prayers 
are with these brave officers’ families as they 
mourn these devastating losses—their heroic 
actions in defense of their country will never 
be forgotten. 
It’s time to stop perpetuating the dangerous 
lies that this election wasn’t legitimate—it was. 
It’s time to stop weaponizing calls for unity as 
an attempt to downplay a violent insurrection 
and avoid ramifications, as if healing can take 
place without accountability—it can’t. 
For too long, too many have treated our de-
mocracy as if it’s a football, something to kick 
around without consequence. It’s not a foot-
ball, it’s more like a fragile egg. If you break 
it, good luck trying to put it back together. Fail-
ing to seek accountability now sends a dan-
gerous signal to the future because the next 
time an authoritarian wannabe takes a run at 
our Constitution, all bets are off. 
At this time in our Nation’s history, our party 
divisions have never seemed smaller. It 
doesn’t matter whether you are a Democrat or 
a Republican, the choice now is between Con-
stitutionalists and Insurrectionists. Constitu-
tionalists believe in the Constitution, the rule of 
law, due process, human rights, and civil 
rights for all our citizens. Insurrectionists be-
lieve in conspiracy theories, an alternate re-
ality, and putting a person or a party above 
the rule of law. 
I can work with anyone that’s a Constitu-
tionalist, regardless of what side of the aisle 
they’re on. But as a Member of Congress, I 
swore an oath not to any one individual or one 
party, but to the Constitution, and I cannot 
work with anyone who is against it. 
I have repeatedly called on the President to 
step down for the sake of our Nation. I have

asked Vice President Pence to invoke the 
25th Amendment to ensure the peaceful trans-
fer of power. Unfortunately, these calls have 
gone unheeded, leaving us no other option 
than to vote to impeach President Trump. We 
must guard against any potential future danger 
the President poses, send a clear message 
that this type of unconstitutional behavior will 
not be tolerated, and restore the sanity and 
sense of calm the American people deserve 
before the inauguration of President-Elect 
Biden. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, the decision 
to impeach a President is a grave one—it is 
a vote that no Member wishes to cast in their 
lifetime. In my nearly four decades of service 
in the House of Representatives, I have voted 
to impeach a President only twice—both times 
during President Trump’s term in office. The 
criminal invasion of the U.S. Capitol last week 
created this unprecedented moment in U.S. 
history when liberty lovers must respond in the 
strongest legal manner. 
Members of Congress take an oath to de-
fend our Constitution against all enemies for-
eign and domestic. During my service, U.S. 
Presidents of both parties understood their 
duty to our Constitution, until now. I frequently 
reflect on the incalculable bravery and sac-
rifice of those Americans who came before us, 
who, from the battlefields of Antietam to the 
beaches of Normandy, fought and died to en-
sure that not only would freedom and liberty 
live on in these lands, but so too would our 
Union itself. 
During these last four years, our beloved 
country has become divided to an extent not 
seen since Reconstruction—a division so pow-
erful that the daily business of our Congress 
has ground to a near halt, at severe expense 
to the People’s work. This is occurring be-
cause of the severe breakdown, political divi-
sions, and incitement exacerbated by lies and 
conspiracy theories recited at length by the 
President himself. He has belligerently refused 
to accept the results of this past election. With 
a clenched fist, he and his allies continue to 
spew divisive vitriol claiming no institution in 
this country, from the free press to inde-
pendent election officials, can be trusted—that 
the only person worthy of the American peo-
ple’s confidence is Donald Trump himself. 
A week ago today, that division boiled over, 
culminating in a vicious attack by a mob on 
the U.S. Capitol, a place that holds national 
and international significance as the temple of 
liberty and representational democracy. Mem-
bers, staff, and the Vice President, who were 
working to certify the election results of the 
2020 Presidential Election, were forced to flee 
for their lives as a mob of violent insurrection-
ists broke through the doors and windows of 
the Capitol, desecrated the halls, and violently 
attacked Capitol Police, killing one and injuring 
over 50. The invaders, many in paramilitary at-
tire, called for the execution of the Vice Presi-
dent, the Speaker of the House, and other 
Members. Some carried law-enforcement style 
handcuffs, bear spray, and firearms, while oth-
ers erected gallows outside and placed pipe- 
bombs nearby. All the while, President Trump 
failed to take any meaningful steps to call off 
the attack, despite calls imploring him to do so 
as the events played out on live television. 
The attack was explicitly incited by Donald 
Trump as he dispatched marchers to the Cap-
itol ‘to fight.’ His incitement of the attack rep-
resents quite possibly the most significant ex-
ample of complete moral failing by any Presi-
dent in American history. 
To impeach a President is a weighty deci-
sion. Today, the decision was clear. President 
Trump is guilty of inciting a violent insurrection 
against the United States in its most sacred 
home of liberty. He should thus be imme-
diately removed from office and prevented 
from ever holding federal office again.

January 13, 2021 
TRIBUTE TO DANIEL SCHWARZ 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker. I rise to 
thank Daniel Schwarz for nearly six years of 
service in my personal office and on the Judi-
ciary Committee. Throughout his time on my 
staff, he has provided key advice across a 
range of issues, and he has crafted effective 
strategies for communicating my office’s vision 
and accomplishments to my constituents and 
to the American people. 
Growing up in the Washington, D.C. area, it 
is perhaps no surprise that Danny has a keen 
understanding and appreciation of government 
and politics. After graduating from Indiana Uni-
versity, he earned a master’s degree in politics 
and communication in the media from the Lon-
don 
School 
of 
Economics 
and 
Political 
Science. He then worked in a variety of com-
munications roles in both domestic and inter-
national politics. 
Danny began working in my personal office 
as Communications Director in April 2015. He 
added the role of Director of Strategic Com-
munications for the Judiciary Committee in 
January 2018, skillfully handling two high-pro-
file and high-pressure positions at once. He 
also ensured that the need to keep my con-
stituents informed never got lost among a sea 
of national press requests. 
In addition to his responsibilities as Commu-
nications Director, he has been a key advisor 
on issues relating to the Jewish community 
and Israel in my personal office. When Presi-
dent Obama negotiated a controversial and 
highly technical agreement preventing Iran 
from acquiring nuclear weapons, Danny’s stra-
tegic thinking and advice was essential to 
evaluating the agreement and navigating the 
complicated political challenges that the deal 
presented. 
Once I decided to support the deal, Danny 
helped craft a lengthy statement describing my 
decision and why I believed it was in the pub-
lic interest, which he helped present to the 
public in a way that was nothing short of mas-
terful. This statement was vital to building con-
fidence with my constituents and with the 
broader public that I had arrived at this difficult 
decision with great thought and care. Danny’s 
knowledge and keen analysis on issues relat-
ing to Israel has also made him an invaluable 
asset to staff from other offices who rely on 
his expertise in advising their Members. 
Danny’s work has always been integral to 
the office, but we needed his effort more than 
ever when President Trump came to office 
and it became necessary to hold him and his 
Administration accountable. As I became in-
volved in more and more high-profile events— 
from rushing to the airport on the day the 
Muslim Ban was enacted, to introducing a 
Resolution of Inquiry about the President’s 
connection to Russia, to calling out the racism 
and anti-Semitism coming out of Charlottes-
ville with a powerful censure resolution. Danny 
was there every step of the way to ensure that 
my work was visible and understandable to 
the public. 
He also helped guide the communications 
strategy during the impeachment proceeding 
of 2019. At a time when the eyes of the world 
were on the Judiciary Committee, Danny had 
the difficult task of helping to shape our mes-
sage and working with all of the Committee 
Members as well as House Leadership and 
the broader Democratic Caucus to ensure that 
we spoke with one voice to make the case to 
the American public. 
At the same time, Danny helped me navi-
gate a local and national press corps hungry 
for information about our work. He developed 
strong relationships with journalists, skillfully 
balanced the needs of different news outlets, 
and he worked hard to keep me on message 
with clear and concise talking points. 
Long before I became Chairman, Danny 
worked tirelessly to ensure that coverage of 
my work would put me and the positions I ad-
vocated in the best light. Danny’s hard work 
behind the scenes also helped me rise to 
Ranking Member and, later, to become Chair-
man, and I am grateful for everything he did 
to get me where I am today. 
Danny’s skill as a writer and as a strategic 
thinker, combined with his good judgment, 
have been invaluable. His thoughtful advice, 
his deep understanding of how our words and 
deeds will be interpreted by the public, and his 
skill in shaping a clear, direct message to ef-
fectively communicate my work will be greatly 
missed. 
Danny enjoys the respect, admiration, and 
friendship of many staffers on the Hill who will 
miss his keen insights, his sense of humor, 
and his unique perspective on many of the 
most pressing issues of the day. 
He is moving on to new challenges in the 
private sector, but we wish him all the best in 
his future endeavors. 
I thank him for his service to my office, to 
the Congress, and to the country.

HONORING COL. MARIA A. JUAREZ 
ON HER PROMOTION TO BRIGA-
DIER GENERAL 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in recognition of U.S. Army Re-
serve Colonel Maria A. Juarez on the occa-
sion of her promotion to Brigadier General. 
Colonel Juarez entered the U.S. Army 
through the R.O.T.C. program at the Univer-
sity of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras campus in 
1992, with honors as distinguished military 
graduate. Specializing in logistics she has 
served in the Quartermaster corps as a Reg-
ular Army and Army Reserve Officer for over 
28 years, serving in multiple staff positions at 
all levels including Office of the Chief of Army 
Reserves, divisional and major Subordinate 
Command levels; with deployments and post-
ings in the Continental States, Germany, the 
Balkans, Korea, and the Middle East. 
Since 2017, she has been the commander 
of the 166th Regional Support Group in Puerto 
Rico, part of the Army Reserve Caribbean 
Geographical Command under 1st Mission 
Support Command. She took command of the 
RSG in July 2017 and within two months was 
faced with the largest domestic relief operation 
of the Army Reserve in Puerto Rico’s history. 
During the Hurricane Maria Relief Effort the 
166th carried out over 700 logistical support 
missions to remote locations throughout Puer-
to Rico. 
From January to September 2019, she de-
ployed with the 166th Group to Afghanistan, 
where she served as the Commander for the 
Regional Support Group in Kabul, Afghani-
stan, after which she was selected to serve 
with the U.S. Central Command as the Deputy 
Plans Chief for Iran Branch. So, she has been 
tested both at home and abroad, facing 
threats both foreign and domestic with distinc-
tion. 
During her career, our newest Brigadier 
General has achieved two Masters degrees, in 
Strategic Studies and in Information Systems 
from the Army War College and Central Michi-
gan University, and earned military awards 
and decorations including the Bronze Star, 
Defense Meritorious Service Medal, six Meri-
torious Service Medals and Army Commenda-
tion Medal, among many others. 
Maria Juarez represents thousands of our 
Army Reserve soldiers in Puerto Rico, serving 
in our home front as part the largest U.S. 
Army command in the Caribbean, in the best 
tradition of service of Puerto Ricans in the 
U.S. military for more than a century. She also 
represents the high achievement of our 
women in uniform, breaking barriers and prov-
ing they are a priceless resource for the pre-
paredness of our Armed Forces. 
As she enters the next stage in her military 
career as a Brigadier General, I congratulate 
Maria A. Juarez and I know she will continue 
to reach great achievements. As the Rep-
resentative from Puerto Rico and Co-Chair of 
the Congressional Women’s Caucus, I am es-
pecially proud to be able to offer this recogni-
tion and to hold forth her example for young 
women at home and across the nation of what 
is possible with commitment, effort and dedi-
cation.

were on a mission to desegregate the library 
system in Jackson, Mississippi. As part of their 
effort they courageously staged a sit-in on 
March 27, 1961 at the Jackson Public Library 
in Jackson, MS. This sit-in was initiated after 
the students recognized the lack of books at 
the George Washington Branch Library (col-
ored). Prior to their ‘‘read-in’’ the students had 
been trained by the president of the Jackson 
Branch of the National Association for the Ad-
vancement of Colored People (NAACP). The 
nine students were all members of the Jack-
son Council of the NAACP. As a result of their 
historic impact in integrating the public library 
system in Mississippi, they will be forever 
known as ‘‘The Tougaloo Nine’’. 
The nine students were arrested and after 
being released from jail Mr. Anding joined the 
Air Force, due to losing his private loan to 
continue his studies at Tougaloo College. Mr. 
Anding would serve four years in the Air Force 
and later return to Tougaloo in 1969 to finish 
his degree. Mr. Anding moved to Buffalo, New 
York, to attend the University of Buffalo and 
earned his master’s degree in Mathematics. 
He met his wife of 50 years, Mrs. Maurice 
Anding. He taught at the State University of 
New York and Niagara University until his re-
tirement in 2007. 
Mr. Anding and his wife eventually moved 
back to Mississippi to be close to family. 
Anding was involved in the Tougaloo commu-
nity and he also attended the 50th anniversary 
of the protest in 2017. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Mr. Meredith 
Anding Jr.

AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 5, 2021 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 21, the FedRAMP Au-
thorization Act. 
As Ranking Member of the Government Op-
erations Subcommittee, it’s my focus to en-
sure the American taxpayer enjoys the benefit 
of efficient, effective, user-friendly I.T. sys-
tems. 
We all know the appropriate use of cloud 
computing technologies can help achieve all of 
those goals, and I thank Subcommittee Chair-
man CONNOLLY for his work on this legislation. 
As we work to understand and respond to 
the 
recently 
discovered 
SUNBURST 
cyberattack, the underlying purpose of the 
FedRAMP program—the security of cloud op-
erations—has never been more important. 
But as we also continue to respond to the 
ongoing pandemic, the demand for constitu-
ents and federal employees to interact re-
motely has never been greater. Thus, the 
flexibility that comes with cloud technologies 
has also never been more important. 
I am pleased the FedRAMP authorization in-
cludes provisions that will reduce the time re-
quired for companies to be certified as 
FedRAMP compliant at a given agency after 
they have already been certified elsewhere in 
the federal government. This provision will go 
a long way towards giving agencies the cloud- 
based tools they need in these trying times. 
Codifying FedRAMP is an important step in 
realizing the savings offered by cloud adoption 
and the savings offered by a more efficient se-
curity authorization process. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill and 
look forward to continuing to work to improve 
government services for the American people.

FAYETTEVILLE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the 100th anniversary of the Kiwanis 
Club of Fayetteville, located in North Caro-
lina’s Eighth Congressional District. Since a 
small group of businessmen met with Kiwanis 
International on November 10, 1920, the 
Kiwanis Club of Fayetteville has made count-
less contributions to our community. 
Over the years, the Kiwanis Club of Fayette-
ville has embodied its motto of ‘‘Serving the 
Children of the World.’’ As a fierce advocate 
for our children and youth, the organization 
has supported clinics for disabled infants, driv-
ing instruction for teenagers, and the construc-
tion of an athletic facility at Fayetteville High 
School, now Terry Sanford High School. 
I know I speak for our entire community in 
offering my most heartfelt gratitude to the 
Kiwanis Club of Fayetteville for their century of 
service. These exemplary men and women 
are the heart and soul of our community and 
I wish them continued success as they serve 
our community. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the 100th anniversary of the Kiwanis 
Club of Fayetteville.

HONORING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM 
DAY 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, since 
1993, every year on January 16th, our nation 
commemorates the 1786 passage of the Vir-
ginia Statute of Religious Freedom, authored 
by Thomas Jefferson. That landmark statute 
would go on to serve as the framework of the 
establishment clause of the First Amendment 
to the United States Constitution, providing the 
foundation for religious freedom here in our 
great nation. 
The past four years have made clear that 
there are those who would choose to distort 
the true definition of religious freedom, in 
order to allow the proliferation of discrimination 
under the guise of what they refer to as ‘‘reli-
gious liberty’’. The result of this callous and 
malignant effort culminated a week and a half 
ago with the storming of the United States 
Capitol building by White Christian Nationalist 
groups allied with the President, and the 
deaths of five Americans. The evidence of this 
fact is made clear by the thousands of 
‘‘Jesus’’ signs, banners, and flags that flew be-
side those bearing the President’s name, and 
those representing the White Supremacist 
movement. 
From the erosion of the Johnson Amend-
ment, to the numerous executive orders 
issued which have served to undermine the 
rights of women and workers, the damage 
done to true religious freedom by a malicious 
administration, is drastic and undeniable. How-
ever, I stand before you today to pledge that 
with the aid of this body, my colleagues and 
I in the Congressional Freethought Caucus will 
do everything within our Constitutional powers 
to correct this distortion of America’s ‘‘first 
freedom’’. 
It is a new day for our nation. The discrimi-
nating policies of the last four years are no 
more. I look forward to working with President- 
elect Biden, Vice President-elect HARRIS to 
correct the harmful policies enacted by the 
Trump administration. On this Religious Free-
dom Day, I call upon my colleagues in the 
House and Senate to pass the Do No Harm

SHELDON ADELSON APPRECIATED 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, my wife Roxanne and I will always 
be appreciative of Sheldon and Miriam 
Adelson who hosted us on a visit to Israel with 
a boat ride on a first century replica fishing 
boat on the Sea of Galilee. I am grateful to 
serve as a co-chair of the Israel Caucus, Shel-
don Adelson was a valued Friend of Israel. 
He is honored by Jonathan Garber of Fox 
Business with an obituary upon his death and 
our family extends our deepest sympathy to 
the Adelson Family. 
Sheldon Adelson, [Las Vegas Sands CEO] 
. . . has died following a battle with cancer. 
He was 87. 
Adelson was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma in 2019 and recently stepped away 
from the company to resume his treatment, 
the company said on Jan 7. 
‘Mr. Adelson was the first employee of Las 
Vegas Sands—‘‘Team Member Number One’’ 
he liked to say. Today, more than 50,000 
Sands team members have Dr. Adelson and 
the entire Adelson family in their thoughts 
and prayers and are grateful to have had 
their lives touched by a true force of nature,’ 
according to a statement from Las Vegas 
Sands. 
Adelson, who is survived by his wife Dr. 
Miriam Adelson and five children, had a net 
worth of $35.6 billion as of Jan. 11, according 
to Forbes. 
A funeral will be held in Israel, the birth-
place of Miriam Adelson, with plans for a 
memorial service held in Las Vegas to be an-
nounced at a later date, according to the 
company. 
He entered the casino business in 1989 when 
he purchased the Sands Hotel and Casino in 
Las Vegas for $128 million and is credited 
with helping transform Las Vegas into the 
top U.S. destination for conventions and ex-
hibitions. 
Adelson in 2007 opened Venetian Macao on 
the Cotai Strip, helping recreate the Las 
Vegas Strip in an autonomous region of the 
People’s Republic of China. Three years 
later, he opened the $6 billion Marina Bay 
Sands resort in Singapore. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops and we 
will never forget September 11th in the Global 
War on Terrorism.

INTRODUCTION OF JONES ACT 
MODERNIZATION BILLS 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, today I intro-
duce three bills to end a century of monopo-
listic closed market domestic cargo shipping to 
and from my isolated home state of Hawaii as 
well as the other island and separated jurisdic-
tions of our country not part of the continental 
United States. In doing so, we will break the 
stranglehold on the peoples and economies of 
these exposed communities and their resulting 
sky-high costs of living which results from just 
a few domestic shipping companies controlling 
the lifeline of commerce upon which we abso-
lutely depend. 
These bills all amend the Merchant Marine 
Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act. 
That federal law mandates that all cargo ship-
ping between U.S. ports occur exclusively on 
U.S., not foreign, flagged vessels. Additionally, 
the law requires that these vessels are built in 
the U.S. and owned and crewed by U.S. citi-
zens. 
The Jones Act was enacted in a protec-
tionist era under the guise of preserving a 
strong national merchant marine. But today it 
is just an anachronism: most of the world’s 
shipping is by way of an international mer-
chant marine functioning in an open, competi-
tive market. And those few U.S. flag cargo 
lines that remain have maneuvered the Jones 
Act to develop virtual monopolies over domes-
tic cargo shipping to, from and within our most 
isolated and exposed locales—our island and 
offshore states and territories—that have no 
alternative modes of transportation such as 
trucking or rail. 
My Hawaii is a classic example. Located al-
most 2,500 miles off the West Coast, we im-
port well over 90 percent of our life necessities 
by ocean cargo. There are plenty of inter-
national cargo lines who could and would 
compete for a share of that market. Yet only 
two U.S. flag domestic cargo lines—Matson 
Navigation and Pasha Hawaii—operate a vir-
tual duopoly over our lifeline. 
While they are nominally subject to federal 
regulation, the fact of the matter is that cargo 
prices have gone in only one direction—up, 
fast and repeatedly, despite a surplus of inter-
national shipping—and it is indisputable that 
there is no downward market pressure which 
would otherwise result from meaningful com-
petition. These accelerating cargo prices are 
not absorbed by the shipping lines, but passed 
through all the way down the chain, to the 
transporters, wholesalers, retailers, small busi-
nesses, mom-n-pops and ultimately con-
sumers, of all of the elementals of life, from 
food to medical supplies, clothes, housing and 
virtually all other goods. The result is a crip-
pling drag on an already-challenged economy 
and the very quality of life in Hawaii. 
The broadest, deepest effects of the Jones 
Act on Hawaii result from its impact on west-
bound imports from the continental United 
States to Hawaii. But Hawaii is an export loca-
tion as well, in key products such as agri-
culture and livestock. Here the Jones Act also 
effectively stifles meaningful competition in 
getting those products to their primary markets 
on the U.S. Mainland. Because the producers 
of these products and all that rely for their own 
livelihood on their successful export have to 
eat inflated shipping costs, these export indus-
tries, which any economist knows are the ulti-
mate key to any economy’s prosperity, are 
also crippled. 
Let’s take a concrete example: Hawaii’s 
once-prosperous 
ranching/cattle 
industry, 
which is so key to the economic health and 
the very lifestyle of so much of areas like the 
rural Big Island, where I was born and raised. 
That industry depends on getting its product, 
young cattle, to West Coast pens and trans-
portation hubs in a cost-efficient manner. 
There are foreign cargo carriers that spe-
cialize, through custom cattle ships and overall 
sensitivity and adjustment to rancher time-
tables and needs, in such transport, but the 
Jones Act outright excludes them from the Ha-
waii-Mainland market. As a result, Hawaii’s 
ranchers are reduced to two crippling, cost 
magnifying options. 
The first is to ship their cargo by foreign car-
riers to Canada, where they have to go 
through a myriad of bureaucratic, cost-magni-
fying gyrations to get their product eventually 
to their U.S. markets. The second is to beg for 
the goodwill of the domestic carriers, to whom 
this is simply a hindrance rather than a major 
commitment, to ship directly to the West 
Coast. 
And it shows: most of the cattle are first 
shipped from Hawaii’s Neighbor Islands, 
where the bulk of the cattle industry is located, 
to O‘ahu, in small ‘‘cow-tainers,’’ where they 
sit for days in Honolulu Harbor awaiting the re-
turn to the Mainland of one of the massive 
cargo ships designed and utilized for quite an-
other purpose. The result (besides associated 
higher costs) is in-harbor cattle waste disposal 
challenges, higher in-transit cattle mortality 
and lower-weight cattle delivery to market. 
That’s what happens when you try to squeeze 
a square peg into a round hole. 
More broadly, there is much evidence about 
the direct impact of the Jones Act on shipping 
prices to noncontiguous areas. At a basic 
level, the everyday goods that we rely on in 
Hawaii cost much more than on the Mainland, 
a difference which largely cannot be attributed 
to anything other than shipping costs. 
Last year, the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii 
published a thorough and first-of-it-kind report, 
‘‘Quantifying the Cost of the Jones Act to Ha-
waii.’’ The report found that: 
The median annual cost of the Jones Act to 
the Hawaii economy is $1.2 billion. 
The annual cost of shipping to Hawaii is es-
timated to be $654 million higher and prices 
$916 million higher. 
The Jones Act annually costs each Hawaii 
resident more than $645. 
Thanks to the Jones Act, Hawaii has ap-
proximately 9,100 fewer jobs, representing 
$404 million in wages. 
Hawaii families across all income groups 
would benefit from Jones Act reform. In the 
absence of Jones Act restrictions, those mak-
ing between $15,000 and $70,000 annually 
would see an annual across-the-board eco-
nomic benefit ranging from $78 million to $154 
million. 
Annual tax revenues would be $148.2 mil-
lion higher. 
Focusing solely on the Jones Act require-
ment that vessels be built in the United States, 
they found that the build provision results in a 
1.2 percent shipping cost increase for Hawaii. 
This translates annually to an added cost of 
$531.7 million to the state’s economy, or 
about $296 per resident. It also means a loss 
of 3,860 jobs, and $30.8 million less in state 
and local tax revenues. 
In 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York studied Puerto Rico’s economy and 
found that ‘‘the high cost of shipping is a sub-
stantial burden on the Island’s productivity.’’ 
The New York Fed found that, ‘‘[i]t costs an 
estimated $3,063 to ship a twenty-foot con-
tainer of household and commercial goods 
from the East Coast of the United States to 
Puerto Rico; the same shipment costs $1,504 
to nearby Santo Domingo (Dominican Repub-
lic) and $1,687 to Kingston (Jamaica)—des-
tinations that are not subject to Jones Act re-
strictions.’’ There is only one reason why costs

are double to ship from the continental United 
States to a domestic port in Puerto Rico as 
compared to foreign ports in the Dominican 
Republic and Jamaica: there is international 
competition on the latter routes, none on the 
domestic route and the shipping companies 
take full advantage of that lack of competition. 
The three bills I introduce today say: 
enough is enough. If the continental U.S., 
wants to continue the Jones Act as to shipping 
between their locations, that’s their business. 
But don’t penalize us island and other non-
contiguous locations by throwing us to the mo-
nopoly wolves you’ve created. 
The first bill, the Noncontiguous Shipping 
Relief Act, exempts all noncontiguous U.S. lo-
cations, including Hawaii, from the Jones Act. 
The second, the Noncontiguous Shipping Rea-
sonable Rate Act, benchmarks the definition of 
a ‘‘reasonable rate’’ that Jones Act shipping 
can charge to within ten percent of analogous 
international shipping rates. And the third, the 
Noncontiguous Shipping Competition Act, pre-
vents monopolies or duopolies in noncontig-
uous Jones Act shipping. Essentially, the bills 
are intended to lay out options for providing 
relief for our U.S. noncontiguous areas. We 
can resolve the issue in many ways, but we 
must change the status quo which has had 
such a deep, broad and negative impact on 
my state and the other jurisdictions beholden 
to the Jones Act. 
The Noncontiguous Shipping Relief Act 
would allow the noncontiguous jurisdictions to 
be serviced by non-Jones Act vessels and in-
crease, or in some cases create any, competi-
tion in these critical shipping lanes. Again, this 
is a small portion of the total national Jones 
Act shipping where it is particularly destructive 
in application. 
Let me address directly the argument of-
fered up by the domestic shippers in defense 
of the Jones Act: that it contains important 
labor and environmental protections that would 
be lost upon repeal. My bill would retain these 
important protections. Specifically, it provides 
that all foreign shippers operating under the 
bill’s Jones Act exemptions must comply with 
the same labor, environmental, tax, docu-
mentation, U.S. locus and other laws as are 
applicable to non-U.S. flag ships and shippers 
transiting U.S. waters today. 
The Noncontiguous Shipping Reasonable 
Rate Act would define a ‘‘reasonable rate’’ for 
the noncontiguous domestic ocean trade as 
no more than ten percent above the rate set 
by a comparable international rate recognized 
by the Federal Maritime Commission. Cur-
rently, the Surface Transportation Board tech-
nically has the authority to adjudicate and set 
precedent on what a ‘‘reasonable rate’’ is for 
Jones Act shipping, but it has almost never 
been used and never to a clear conclusion on 
what is a reasonable rate. My bill would define 
reasonable to remove uncertainty. Current 
Jones Act shipping rates vary widely and there 
is no central compilation of these rates. The 
ten percent benchmark would allow for vari-
ance but also ensure that Americans in our 
noncontiguous areas are not forced to pay ex-
orbitant rates way above shipping rates which 
would otherwise be provided through inter-
national competition were the Jones Act not 
applicable. 
The Noncontiguous Shipping Competition 
Act would exempt shipping routes to non-
contiguous jurisdictions from the Jones Act re-
quirements if a monopoly or duopoly exists on 
those routes. The Jones Act has resulted in 
the blossoming of monopolies and duopolies 
in our noncontiguous jurisdictions. To ensure 
that these communities, which are the most 
reliant in the country on shipping to receive 
necessities, are not held hostage to these 
dominant companies, my bill would give Jones 
Act exemptions to routes that are not serviced 
by at least three companies with separate 
ownership. In short, if a domestic route is in 
fact in a competitive environment, the Jones 
Act is less of a problem, but if there is no 
competition, then the route should be opened 
up to international competition by rescinding 
the Jones Act. 
Madam Speaker, these long-overdue bills 
are of the utmost importance to the localities 
which have long borne the unfair brunt of the 
Jones Act. It is often difficult to pierce the veil 
of longstanding custom and understanding to 
see the real negative impacts of a law and 
what should instead be. It is even more dif-
ficult to change a law which provides a feder-
ally-created and endorsed monopoly under 
which no competition exists to hold down 
prices. Yet clearly the time for these measures 
is overdue. I urge their passage.

HONORING THE UNITED STATES 
CAPITOL POLICE 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 13, 2021 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, as we recover 
from the January 6th attack on the U.S. Cap-
itol, I am humbled and honored to recognize, 
along with my friend and colleague, Congress-
man PERLMUTTER, our deep admiration and 
gratitude for the heroic actions of the men and 
women of the United States Capitol Police and 
to remember the two officers lost, Office 
Sicknick and Officer Liebengood. 
H. Res. 39 will ensure that the legacies of 
Officer Sicknick and Officer Liebengood will 
never be forgotten. 
I extend my sincere condolences to the fam-
ilies of Officer Sicknick and Officer Liebengood 
and am proud to recognize the selfless dedi-
cation and service that the men and women of 
the United States Capitol Police alongside all 
other involved federal, state, and local law en-
forcement agencies displayed on that day as 
they do every day. 
H. Res. 39—Honoring the bravery and self- 
sacrifice by officers of the United States Cap-
itol Police and other Federal, State, and local 
law enforcement agencies during the January 
6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol. 
Whereas on Wednesday, January 6, 2021, 
during a joint session of Congress, an attack 
occurred on the United States Capitol, gravely 
threatening the physical wellbeing of the Vice 
President, members of the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate along with hun-
dreds of civilians located within and on the 
grounds of the Capitol Complex and the secu-
rity of the Capitol Complex itself; 
Whereas United States Capitol Police offi-
cers and other law enforcement officers di-
rectly engaged the attackers, who were armed 
with explosives, metal pipes, chemical irritants, 
and other weapons; 
Whereas Officer Brian D. Sicknick of the 
United States Capitol Police sustained fatal in-
juries while engaging with the attackers and 
defending the United States Capitol; 
Whereas Officer Howard Liebengood of the 
United States Capitol Police died while off- 
duty after the attacks on the United States 
Capitol; 
Whereas more than 50 United States Cap-
itol Police officers and Metropolitan Police De-
partment of the District of Columbia officers 
sustained injuries during the attack on the 
United States Capitol; and 
Whereas no members of the House of Rep-
resentatives or the Senate were injured during 
the attack due to the swift and courageous ac-
tions taken by members of the United States 
Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Depart-
ment of the District of Columbia, and other 
Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
agencies: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) commends the examples of bravery and 
service-above-self demonstrated by officers of 
the United States Capitol Police, the Metro-
politan Police Department of the District of Co-
lumbia, and the multiple Federal, State, and 
local law enforcement agencies and protective 
entities that joined alongside of them during 
the January 6, 2021 attack on the United 
States Capitol; and 
(2) honors the example of service and devo-
tion to duty displayed by Officer Brian D. 
Sicknick and Officer Howard Liebengood of 
the United States Capitol Police.
