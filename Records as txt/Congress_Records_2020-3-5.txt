Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, 
California, offered the following pray-
er: 
Loving God, creator of all, we thank 
You for the gift of another day, to live 
and to learn, to love and to serve. 
As our Nation faces the impact of the 
coronavirus, we pray for the health of 
our people. Bless and inspire our med-
ical professionals, our public health of-
ficials, and researchers in their fight 
against the virus. We pray for those 
who have died and those who are sick. 
Bless the people of this House, those 
elected and those who support their 
work. Give them Your discerning wis-
dom as they go about their labors. 
Bless them with courage and deter-
mination to do the hard work of jus-
tice-building and peacemaking. Gift 
them with a spirit of solidarity and un-
derstanding to collaborate across dif-
ferences to serve the common good. 
And help them to always listen to the 
most vulnerable and voiceless in our 
land. 
May every prayer and work of ours 
today begin from You, dear Lord, and 
through You be happily ended. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STANTON) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. STANTON led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
WELCOMING REVEREND KEVIN F. 
O’BRIEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. LOFGREN) is recognized for 1 
minute. 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
great honor to note that Father Kevin 
O’Brien of the Society of Jesus was our 
guest this morning to deliver this 
morning’s opening prayer for this 
House. 
Father O’Brien joined our Silicon 
Valley community 4 years ago, and 
just last year he was named president 
of Santa Clara University. As an alum 
of Santa Clara University Law School 
myself, I am glad to see Father O’Brien 
focusing his presidency on college af-
fordability and access, as well as fos-
tering a culture of respect on campus. 
Now a religious leader in Silicon Val-
ley, Father O’Brien speaks of how dis-
ruption can lift people up instead of di-
viding people. Father O’Brien is dedi-
cated to serving something larger than 
himself, which is a trait we deeply ad-
mire and value as Americans. 
I am personally grateful to him for 
the leadership he has shown to stand-
ing up for Dreamers and those who are 
vulnerable 
in 
our 
community 
and 
across America. 
It is my pleasure to welcome Father 
O’Brien to our Nation’s Capital today 
and to thank him for his service to our 
community, our country, and to the 
University of Santa Clara. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five further 
requests for 1-minute speeches on each 
side of the aisle. 
f 
URGING THE SENATE TO ACT 
(Ms. BROWNLEY of California asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. 
Speaker, over 275 bipartisan bills are 
piled up on MITCH MCCONNELL’s desk 
because he refuses to bring them to the 
Senate floor for a vote. 
Three of those bills are my bills, each 
of which passed the House with over 400 
votes from Democrats and Republicans 
alike. 
H.R. 95, the Homeless Veterans Fami-
lies Act, will keep veterans and their 
families together and off the streets in 
safe and adequate housing. 
H.R. 840, the Veterans’ Access to 
Child Care Act, will ensure veterans 
have access to childcare to attend crit-
ical medical appointments. 
And H.R. 3224, the Deborah Sampson 
Act, aims to address the inequities and 
barriers that women veterans face 
when accessing VA care and benefits. 
I urge Majority Leader MCCONNELL 
to allow the Senate to vote so our vet-
erans will have the support and care 
they have earned and deserve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1508 
March 5, 2020 
RECOGNIZING A WINNING WEEK-
END IN SOUTH CAROLINA BAS-
KETBALL 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, this was a winning weekend 
for basketball in South Carolina. 
On Saturday, both the boys and girls 
Cardinal Newman High School basket-
ball teams won their State titles, and 
this past Sunday, the University of 
South Carolina women’s basketball 
team won the Southeastern Conference 
Championship. Both Cardinal Newman 
teams fought until the end to accom-
plish these impressive wins. 
Congratulations to girls’ coach Molly 
Moore and boys coach Philip Deter on 
their successful leadership. The Car-
dinal Newman girls won over North-
wood, and the boys won against Trin-
ity-Byrnes. 
Congratulations to the University of 
South Carolina Women’s Basketball 
Head Coach of the Year, Dawn Staley, 
on leading number one South Carolina 
to its program-record 23rd straight 
win. USC women have a perfect record 
of 16–0 in the Southeastern Conference 
this season. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism. 
Mark Levin is correct. Senator SCHU-
MER should be reprimanded for threat-
ening bodily harm to Supreme Court 
Justices. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST LIFT UP LOCAL 
HEALTH OFFICIALS 
(Mr. STANTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, yester-
day the House fulfilled a critical duty. 
We passed an emergency funding bill to 
address the coronavirus to make sure 
that we give public health officials 
across America the tools to help keep 
Americans healthy. 
My State, Arizona, had the fifth con-
firmed case of COVID–19 and recently 
has another presumptive positive case. 
Since the first U.S. case was identi-
fied, State and local public health offi-
cials have had to carry the heavy bur-
den of responding to this outbreak and 
preventing it from getting worse. 
Our local communities should not 
take this on alone. The spread of the 
deadly coronavirus demands a coordi-
nated, 
comprehensive, 
government- 
wide response. In our emergency fund-
ing package, we specifically allocated 
almost $1 billion to go directly to State 
and local communities 
In Arizona, our public health officials 
and our Governor have indicated a need 
for upwards of $13 million to effectively 
meet the demand that the coronavirus 
outbreak merits. It is time we get our 
State and local agencies the support 
they need. 
Congress must always do all that we 
can to lift up our local health officials, 
and our funding bill does exactly that. 
f 
CONGRESS MUST HONOR THEIR 
COMMITMENT TO VETERANS 
(Mr. COX of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. COX of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Brain Injury 
Awareness Month. 
Since 2014, over 470,000 veterans have 
been diagnosed with a TBI, a traumatic 
brain injury. 
Last year, through appropriations, I 
submitted an amendment requesting a 
$10 million increase to the Defense 
Health Program to fund research for 
all servicepersons returning home with 
a TBI. I am happy to report this 
amendment was passed into law. 
In February of this year, the GAO re-
leased a report entitled ‘‘Veterans’ Use 
of Long-Term Care is Increasing, and 
VA Faces Challenges in Meeting the 
Demand.’’ 
The brave people who serve this 
country should never find difficulty in 
locating a facility or a program that 
fits their needs. 
This year, I ask my colleagues to 
support my request for further invest-
ment into research so the VA can de-
velop TBI long-term care programs, so 
we can honor our commitment to those 
who have sacrificed so much for our 
country. 
f 
HONORING THE WOMEN OF THE 
UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REP-
RESENTATIVES 
(Ms. ADAMS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the women of the 
United States House of Representatives 
for Women’s History Month. 
This Women’s History Month marks 
the 100th year of women’s suffrage in 
the United States. 
While 
the 
first 
Congresswoman 
joined the House in 1917, the first 
woman of color didn’t join our Cham-
ber until Hawaii sent Patsy Mink to 
Washington in 1965. And the first Afri-
can American Congresswoman didn’t 
arrive until the unbossed and unbought 
Shirley Chisholm joined us in 1969. 
Our colleague, NANCY PELOSI, became 
the first and only woman Speaker of 
the House in 2007. 
In 2014, I will never forget, I was hon-
ored to be elected by the people of 
North Carolina’s 12th District to serve 
as the 100th woman in the 113th Con-
gress. 
In 2018, a record 127 women were 
elected to Congress, with over 100 
women in the House alone. 
However, there is still work to be 
done. 127 out of 535 is just 24 percent, 
and that is not what our country looks 
like. 
We need more women Members be-
cause, despite the fact that women 
have had the vote for 100 years, we still 
don’t have equal justice under the law. 
To this day, we are still paid less for 
our work, face workplace harassment, 
and are discriminated against simply 
because of being who we are. Women 
work full time, year-round still only 
making 82 cents on the dollar for the 
earnings men make. 
Fighting against these disparities 
and ensuring our Federal Government 
and policies are reflective of the whole 
country is why having women in Con-
gress is so important. 
So, as we honor women’s history, 
let’s remember that all of us have not 
only the ability, but also the obliga-
tion to make history. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BARRIO STATION’S 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Barrio Station in rec-
ognition of the 50th anniversary of 
their creation. 
Barrio Station is a community-based 
organization in the Barrio Logan com-
munity of San Diego, California. It was 
established in 1970 by Ms. Rachael 
Ortiz to provide underserved youths 
and their families with resources that 
they need to succeed. 
This organization has continuously 
provided youth with access to indi-
vidual counseling, referrals to voca-
tional and higher education, and expo-
sure to scholarships. 
Barrio Station has worked toward re-
vitalizing the community by pushing 
for the development of low-income 
housing and opportunities there. 
Families and senior citizens are as-
sisted with completing forms which 
give them access to the benefits that 
they have earned. 
For over 50 years, Barrio Station has 
provided resources to approximately 
3,500 youths, families, and seniors 
every year. 
I thank Barrio Station and, espe-
cially, Director Rachael Ortiz, for their 
exceptional dedication to the youth 
and families of the 51st Congressional 
District and all of California.

(1) with duty stations in the contiguous 48 
States; and 
(2) with duty stations outside of such 
States, including those employees located in 
any territory or possession of the United 
States. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentleman 
from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Alabama. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
This amendment is a sensible re-
quirement to examine the pay equity 
for screeners in all parts of the United 
States. 
Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman 
from Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N) for her amendment and for her 
leadership on this issue. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, even though I am not 
opposed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman from New York is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair, 
this measure improves the underlying 
bill by requiring GAO to study dif-
ferences between pay rates for TSA em-
ployees working in Alaska, Hawaii, and 
the territories and those working in 
the contiguous 48 States. 
We know that pay satisfaction is 
very low within TSA. In fact, in a re-
cent governmentwide survey, TSA’s 
workforce reported being the least sat-
isfied with pay than Federal workers at 
414 other Federal agencies. 
I commend Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N for 
recognizing that, under the current 
system, there are disparities in pay 
within TSA that have implications for 
workers outside the contiguous 48 
States. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. ROGERS). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. ROSE OF 
NEW YORK 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in 
House Report 116–411. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair-
man, I have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following: 
SEC. 7. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION WITH RESPECT 
TO CERTAIN CRIMES RELATING TO 
TERRORISM. 
Nothing in this Act may be construed to 
contradict chapter 113B of title 18, United 
States Code, including with respect to— 
(1) section 2332b (relating to acts of ter-
rorism transcending national boundaries); 
(2) section 2339 (relating to harboring or 
concealing terrorists); and 
(3) section 2339A (relating to providing ma-
terial support to terrorists). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentleman 
from New York (Mr. ROSE) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Before I begin, I would like to thank 
Chairman THOMPSON for his leadership 
in bringing this important bill to the 
floor today. I am proud to be a cospon-
sor of this bill. 
On 9/11, we all watched in horror as 
the events of that day played out in 
real time. 
As a native New Yorker growing up 
in the shadows of the World Trade Cen-
ter, I saw firsthand the impact that 
terrorism can have. 
Since that fateful day, we have seen 
our Nation take many important steps 
to prevent terrorist attacks from hap-
pening. For example, Congress created 
the Transportation Security Adminis-
tration 
and 
passed 
several 
laws 
strengthening our Nation’s transpor-
tation systems. 
While I applaud these efforts and 
those of others, we must continue to 
remain vigilant in light of current 
world events. 
My amendment, in this light, is sim-
ple. It reaffirms our Nation’s commit-
ment to prevent terrorism and ensures 
our national security agencies can con-
tinue to prosecute and prevent ter-
rorist activities from occurring in our 
homeland. 
Mr. Chair, I say to my colleagues, let 
us all take a simple but important step 
to reaffirm our commitment to prevent 
terrorism. I urge all Members to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Alabama is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, as we have discussed, this bill 
makes it more difficult for TSA to pro-
tect the traveling public from ter-
rorism. The gentleman’s amendment 
does nothing to fix that. 
In fact, the gentleman’s amendment 
does nothing at all, but it certainly is 
reassuring to hear that some in the 
majority still support our counterter-
rorism laws. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Chair, I 
urge my colleagues to support my 
amendment to continue protecting our 
Nation from terrorism, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. ROSE). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Chair under-
stands that amendment No. 3 will not 
be offered. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. PETERS 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 4 printed in 
House Report 116–411. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chair, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 7. REPORT BY GAO REGARDING TSA RE-
CRUITMENT. 
Not later than one year after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller 
General of the United States shall submit to 
Congress a report on the efforts of the Trans-
portation Security Administration regarding 
recruitment, including recruitment efforts 
relating to veterans and the dependents of 
veterans and members of the Armed Forces 
and the dependents of such members. Such 
report shall also include recommendations 
regarding how the Administration may im-
prove such recruitment efforts. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentleman 
from California (Mr. PETERS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chair, I rise today 
in support of my amendment to H.R. 
1140, the Rights for Transportation Se-
curity Officers Act. 
Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman THOMP-
SON for his work on this important bill 
to help get our Transportation Secu-
rity officers, or TSOs, onto the General 
Schedule scale and give them needed 
workplace protections that other Fed-
eral workers receive. 
Every week, other Members of Con-
gress and I see the vital role Transpor-
tation Security officers perform in 
keeping our country safe. They are es-
sential to national security. 
Unfortunately, there is a serious em-
ployee recruitment and retention prob-
lem at the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration. 
In 2017, the TSA spent $75 million 
just on recruitment, hiring, and train-
ing costs. Over 1,900 TSOs quit that 
year, at a cost of $16 million to the tax-
payer. 
Putting these employees on the GS 
scale will help with these retention 
issues. 
Additionally, Congress needs to en-
sure we recruit the most qualified indi-
viduals to combat terrorism and keep 
travelers safe. In order to do that, we 
need to know how the TSA is recruit-
ing top candidates, including military 
veterans. 
My amendment requires a GAO study 
on how the TSA recruits workers and, 
specifically, TSA’s efforts to recruit 
veterans and military spouses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1511 
March 5, 2020 
In San Diego, where we have the 
third largest veteran population in the 
country, we often see vets continuing 
to serve their country through Federal 
employment. Security jobs like those 
in the TSA demand a competency often 
found in military veterans. Hiring vets 
is an asset to the TSA, but we have 
heard from TSOs in my district that 
job dissatisfaction prompts many of 
them to leave the TSA in favor of 
working elsewhere. 
The GAO study I am proposing will 
also provide recommendations for im-
provement, enabling the TSA to con-
tinue cultivating a workforce that 
complements the goals of the agency 
and responsibly spends our tax dollars. 
Many Members of this Chamber, on 
both sides of the aisle, have stood on 
this floor and championed the cause of 
hiring vets and military spouses. It is a 
policy that we have incentivized pri-
vate corporations to implement, and 
we have criticized employers for not 
doing or doing improperly. 
Mr. Chair, I ask that my colleagues 
support this amendment so that we can 
ensure TSA is effectively recruiting 
the most qualified candidates and 
spending our taxpayer dollars wisely. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, even though I am not 
opposed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CISNEROS). 
Without objection, the gentleman from 
Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, this amendment calls for a study 
on how TSA can recruit more veterans. 
I find that ironic, given that the un-
derlying bill actually eliminates the 
existing hiring preferences for vet-
erans, but the study is a good idea. 
Maybe it will come back and tell Con-
gress that they ought to restore the 
hiring preferences for veterans that we 
currently have. That would be a good 
way to recruit veterans. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chair, I yield such 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman from Mississippi (Mr. THOMP-
SON), my colleague and the chair of the 
committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chair, I thank the gentleman for yield-
ing time. 
Mr. Chair, we have worked long and 
hard on crafting a bill that I am con-
vinced would be in the best interests of 
those TSO employees who work dili-
gently to keep us safe, making sure 
that all is well when we fly in and out 
of Washington as Members of Congress, 
as well as the 450 airports all around 
the United States. 
They do a good job, but they are not 
treated fairly. 
We want to make sure, in this in-
stance, with the amendment, that we 
improve on the bill. So I rise in support 
of the amendment offered by my col-
league, Mr. PETERS from California. 
TSA takes pride in hiring veterans 
and reports that a quarter of its work-
force is comprised of veterans. That is 
a good thing. 
Still, there are questions about the 
way TSA uses its personnel flexibilities 
when it comes to recruiting and hiring 
veterans. 
The Peters amendment would require 
the Government Accountability Office 
to conduct a study of TSA’s recruit-
ment process, including its recruit-
ment of veterans. This amendment will 
improve the underlying bill by ensur-
ing that, as TSA moves forward under 
title 5, it does so in a way that recruits 
and retains veterans. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support this amendment. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I can’t overstate this: The real 
irony of this amendment is the under-
lying bill eliminates the hiring pref-
erences for veterans. 
We all want to give preference to vet-
erans for their service to our country. 
The best thing we can do to make that 
happen is to leave current law in place. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chair, I appreciate 
the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. ROG-
ERS) 
not 
opposing 
this 
particular 
amendment, understanding his reserva-
tions about the underlying bill. 
I think what we are trying to do in 
good faith is to address some of the 
issues that he has raised about what 
some of the best procedures are to pur-
sue going forward. 
Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues for 
their support, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. PETERS). 
The amendment was agreed to.

AMENDMENT NO. 5 OFFERED BY MR. BROWN OF 
MARYLAND 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 5 printed in 
House Report 116–411. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 7. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that the Trans-
portation Security Administration’s per-
sonnel system provides insufficient benefits 
and workplace protections to the workforce 
that secures the nation’s transportation sys-
tems and that the Transportation Security 
Administration’s workforce should be pro-
vided protections and benefits under title 5, 
United States Code. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. BROWN) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Chair, I want to recognize the 
hard work of Chairman BENNIE THOMP-
SON on the underlying bill, and the en-
tire Homeland Security Committee. 
My district, Maryland’s Fourth Con-
gressional District, has the fifth larg-
est number of Federal employees in the 
country. These public servants go to 
work every day to make the country 
safer and a better place to live for our 
families. 
For years, transportation security of-
ficers have not had basic workplace 
protections, such as collective bar-
gaining rights, whistleblower protec-
tions, and paid leave. Since 2011, trans-
portation security officers, who make 
up 70 percent of TSA’s workforce, have 
had labor union representation but, be-
cause of limitations imposed by TSA, 
have been denied full collective bar-
gaining rights. 
TSOs were most severely impacted 
during the last government shutdown. 
During the shutdown, more than 50,000 
TSA officers were deemed essential 
Federal employees, meaning they had 
to work without pay. Due to financial 
strain, officers called out in record 
numbers, which led to low morale and 
high turnover among its workforce. 
Staffing shortages prompted officials 
to consolidate checkpoints, creating 
long lines at some of the country’s 
busiest airports, including Miami, At-
lanta, and in my backyard at BWI 
Thurgood Marshall and Reagan Na-
tional Airport, where my constituents 
felt the most strain. 
Federal workers who protect our 
country should not have to work in 
such strenuous conditions. Transpor-
tation security officers are vital safe-
guards for our Nation’s transportation 
system. They should be afforded the 
same rights and benefits as other Fed-
eral employees. 
My amendment reaffirms the impor-
tance of TSA’s workforce and recog-
nizes that TSOs should be provided the 
same protections and benefits as other 
Federal employees under title V. 
In addition to collective bargaining 
rights, the transition to title V would 
increase salaries for most TSA employ-
ees and provide opportunities for reg-
ular pay raises for those meeting per-
formance standards. 
TSA employees and TSOs are essen-
tial to our national security and safe-
ty. It is time we treat them with the 
respect they deserve. I strongly encour-
age my colleagues to support this 
amendment and the underlying legisla-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, this amendment is a sense of Con-
gress articulating support for the un-
derlying bill, an underlying bill which I

have made clear over the last 2 days 
would reduce pay and benefits for our 
TSOs. That is unacceptable. We should 
be trying to increase their pay and ben-
efits and their flexibility rather than 
trying to cap it by moving into title V. 
I can’t support this amendment be-
cause I don’t support the underlying 
bill. There are many of us who feel that 
way, who care very deeply about TSOs 
being compensated better and given 
better benefits, so, for that reason, I 
oppose the bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON), my friend 
and chairman of the committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chair, I appreciate the gentleman 
yielding me the time. 
Let me be clear. This bill enhances 
opportunities for TSOs. It increases the 
possibility of them getting employ-
ment by putting them on the GS sched-
ule for Federal employees, so I am 
somewhat mystified that a bill that is 
designed to bring a group of employees 
into a system that all other Federal 
employees are in is somehow penal-
izing those employees. 
The very intent of this bill is to level 
the playing field for TSOs, who, every-
body agrees, are doing a wonderful job, 
so I continue to be somewhat baffled by 
the arguments against it. 
I support the gentleman from Mary-
land’s amendment. This amendment 
adds additional language to the bill to 
reiterate Congress’ intent that TSA 
employees should have the same pro-
tections and benefits as the rest of the 
Federal workforce. 
This current system that we have is 
not working for TSA employees. All 
you have to do is talk to them. When 
you go through the airports, just ask 
them: ‘‘Are you happy with how you 
are being treated and paid right now?’’ 
Without a doubt, they will tell you: 
‘‘No.’’ So this is to fix it. 
I compliment the gentleman from 
Maryland’s strengthening of the intent 
of this legislation. But, more impor-
tantly, the bargaining unit that rep-
resents the employees, the American 
Federation of Government Employees, 
which represents all the TSOs, all 
46,000, they are in support of it. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support the amendment. 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair, 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, my friend and colleague from 
Mississippi is right about part of what 
he said, that is that if you talk to TSOs 
throughout this country, they are 
grossly dissatisfied with their pay, and 
rightfully so. We have not done our job 
in Congress to adequately fund the 
TSA to pay them better. 
The TSA wants to increase their pay. 
Under current law, they have a lot 
more capacity to raise their pay. If we 
move them to title V, that pay is 
capped. 
My friend from Maryland is abso-
lutely right in his desire to want to 
help the TSOs. This underlying bill 
doesn’t do it. We need to get with our 
appropriating brothers and sisters and 
urge them to fund the President’s 2021 
budget which does provide the money 
that would allow TSOs to be properly 
paid and not capped. 
I remind everybody that it was the 
Obama human capital experts who had 
a blue-ribbon study that recommended 
that we not move the TSA employees 
back to title V because it would, in 
fact, cut their pay and limit many of 
their benefits. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. BROWN). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. KIM 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 6 printed in 
House Report 116–411. 
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 7. ASSISTANCE FOR FEDERAL AIR MARSHAL 
SERVICE. 
The Administrator of the Transportation 
Security Administration shall engage and 
consult with public and private entities asso-
ciated with the Federal Air Marshal Service 
to address concerns regarding Federal Air 
Marshals related to the following: 
(1) Mental health. 
(2) Suicide rates. 
(3) Morale and recruitment. 
(4) Any other personnel issues the Admin-
istrator determines appropriate. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. KIM) and a Mem-
ber opposed each will control 5 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I rise today to 
introduce this simple amendment that 
addresses a complex and tragic prob-
lem. 
The U.S. Federal Air Marshal Serv-
ice, men and women tasked with pro-
tecting the thousands of airline pas-
sengers and crew who fly across the 
United States and globally every day, 
is in a state of crisis. 
The public servants who are com-
mitted to our safety are subject to 
high-stress work environments that 
have led to a drastic increase in health 
issues, turnover in staff, and even a 
number of highly disturbing murders 
and suicides. In a story published by 
ABC News last year, Sonya Hightower 
LaBosco, the president of the Air Mar-
shal National Council, a union which 
represents thousands of air marshals, 
said: ‘‘The crisis is here—it’s an epi-
demic.’’ 
My amendment addresses that epi-
demic by requiring that the TSA con-
sult with the Federal Air Marshal 
Service and the bodies who represent 
its members to address concerns that 
have led to this crisis. It provides a 
path to finding solutions on mental 
health and suicide, while improving 
morale, recruitment, and retention. 
The cost of inaction is simply too 
high. We see the cost of inaction in the 
story of Mario Vanetta. Mario was a 
New Jersey air marshal who fatally 
shot his wife and himself in a murder- 
suicide last October. Mario left behind 
three children, and his tragic story is 
one we cannot ignore or forget. 
When our neighbors answer the call 
to service, they deserve our full sup-
port. Members of the Federal Air Mar-
shal Service serve our country every 
day under incredible stress and dif-
ficult conditions. We have seen what 
those conditions do and the lives they 
impact. The time is now to act, to 
honor their service, and to put an end 
to this epidemic before it takes more 
American lives. 
Mr. Chair, I hope you will join me in 
passing this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, although I am not op-
posed to it. 
The Acting Chair (Mr. BROWN
of 
Maryland). Without objection, the gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, 
we have consistently seen reporting 
and 
data 
highlighting 
the 
unique 
health and well-being challenges of 
Federal air marshals. This amendment 
is a commendable effort to examine the 
issue, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chairman, I yield to 
the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I am happy to rise in sup-
port of the amendment offered by the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. KIM). 
Federal air marshals are an essential 
component of the layered aviation se-
curity system that was created in the 
wake of the September 11 attacks. 
Every day, these quiet heroes keep the 
flying public safe. 
As Representative KIM’s amendment 
recognizes, there are some major per-
sonnel changes within FAMS that need 
timely attention. I commend the gen-
tleman from New Jersey for intro-
ducing this amendment to direct TSA 
to aggressively take on the mental 
health and morale challenges within 
this subset of the TSA workforce. 
Again, I compliment the gentleman 
for his amendment and urge support. 
Mr. KIM. Mr. Chair, I would like to 
remind my colleagues that this bill 
isn’t just a matter of national security; 
it is a matter of life and death for the 
men and women we depend on to keep 
our airline passengers and crews safe 
every day. 
Mr. Chair, I urge everyone to join me 
in standing up for them and to put an 
end to this crisis, and I yield back the 
balance of my time.

SEC. 7. VETERANS HIRING. 
The Secretary shall prioritize the hiring of 
veterans, including disabled veterans, and 
other preference eligible individuals, includ-
ing widows and widowers of veterans, as de-
fined in section 2108 of title 5, United States 
Code, for covered positions. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentleman

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Chair, I want to 
thank my colleague, Mr. THOMPSON, for 
his steadfast leadership on this critical 
issue and for working with me to en-
sure that this amendment be made in 
order. 
Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amend-
ment which would require the Sec-
retary 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
to 
prioritize the hiring of veterans and re-
lated 
preference-eligible 
individuals, 
including disabled veterans and widows 
or widowers of veterans, for positions 
within the Transportation Security 
Administration. 
Mr. Chair, I rise as a supporter and 
cosponsor of H.R. 1140 because I believe 
we must do what we can to ensure our 
public servants have fair pay and ade-
quate protections. This is especially 
true for the Federal workforce charged 
with preserving our national security 
and protecting our Nation. 
As the threats against our Nation 
continue to evolve in complexity, TSA 
employees are tasked with adapting 
just the same. They deserve the ability 
to negotiate compensation equitable to 
the service they provide. 
b 0945 
I rise to offer this amendment to en-
sure that our TSA workforce includes 
the fortitude of our Nation’s heroes, 
veterans who are already mission-driv-
en, molded in integrity, national-secu-
rity minded, and, above all, driven by a 
proven track record of service to the 
mission. I have heard firsthand testi-
mony of servicemen and -women, many 
returning with service-connected dis-
abilities, but many who still yearn to 
serve and protect our Nation. 
What better way than with the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion, a crucial necessity to the safe-
keeping of our Nation’s citizens? 
My amendment would direct the Sec-
retary 
of 
Homeland 
Security 
to 
prioritize our Nation’s heroes first 
when hiring to support TSA’s work-
force. This includes veteran-related- 
preference-eligible individuals such as 
disabled veterans and widows or wid-
owers of veterans. As a Navy veteran 
and member of the House Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee and the House Armed 
Services Committee, the hiring of our 
servicemembers and veterans is one of 
my top priorities. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to join me in support of this amend-
ment to ensure we do not overlook vet-
erans who would strengthen the TSA 
workforce. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment. 
Here is another example of a mes-
saging amendment that doesn’t fix the 
veterans’ hiring problem in the under-
lying bill. All this does is restate the 
veterans preference language in title 5. 
It does not restore the full veterans 
preference that exist under current 
law. 
I don’t understand why the majority 
keeps restating this instead of fixing 
the underlying bill and allowing the 
veterans preference—which is broad-
er—to remain in place without the im-
pediment imposed by this underlying 
bill. 
So, Mr. Chairman, I oppose the 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Mississippi 
(Mr. 
THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I rise in support of the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from California (Mr. CISNEROS). 
Let me be clear. We want to do all we 
can for our veterans. They have done a 
tremendous job defending us all over 
the world. The least we can do is when 
they return, or, unfortunately, when 
they don’t return through tragedy, we 
take care of the families by offering 
them employment. 
This 
is 
a 
simple, 
commonsense 
amendment that I would hope there 
would be no disagreement on. All this 
does is provide the same language that 
we use for all other title 5 employees, 
which the intent of the overall bill is 
to bring everybody under the same sys-
tem. 
So, I rise in support of the gentleman 
from California’s amendment and ask 
for its approval. 
Mr. CISNEROS. Mr. Chairman, I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. Chairman, I just want to reit-
erate this is a simple amendment in 
support of our Nation’s veterans. I urge 
my colleagues to adopt the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I want to restate that the under-
lying bill restricts the veterans pref-
erence in the hiring that exists now. 
Under current law, all veterans are 
given preference in hiring at the TSA. 
Under the underlying bill, it would be 
restricted to those veterans who had a 
rank of O3 or less. Only they would get 
preferences. I don’t think this is where 
this Congress wants to go. 
Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amend-
ment, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. CISNEROS). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from California will be 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 8 OFFERED BY MS. 
SPANBERGER 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 8 printed in 
House Report 116–411. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON CERTAIN SOCIAL MEDIA 
APPLICATION. 
Beginning on the date of the enactment of 
this Act, covered employees may not use or 
have installed on United States Government- 
issued mobile devices the social media video 
application known as ‘‘TikTok’’ or any suc-
cessor application. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentlewoman 
from Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Virginia. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin 
by thanking Chairman THOMPSON for 
his leadership on this important legis-
lation and for his commitment to the 
men and women who keep our airports 
and travelers safe. 
I am proud to cosponsor this bipar-
tisan bill because I share the chair-
man’s commitment to ensuring that 
the TSA workforce receives the rights 
that they have earned. 
I am also proud to lead this amend-
ment, which would codify the adminis-
tration’s ban on TSA employees using 
or installing the app TikTok on their 
government-issued phones. 
While to some TikTok may seem like 
a harmless app, TikTok presents a sig-
nificant 
counterintelligence 
threat. 
Our intelligence experts are rightly 
concerned about the use of the TikTok 
app, especially on U.S. Government- 
issued devices. 
As many of my colleagues know, 
TikTok, like other Chinese companies,

is required under Chinese law to share 
information with the government and 
its institutions. There are real con-
cerns that this app could also collect 
information on users in the United 
States to advance Chinese counter-
intelligence efforts. And because it 
could become a tool for surveilling U.S. 
citizens or Federal personnel, TikTok 
has no business being on U.S. Govern-
ment-issued devices. 
While entrusted with keeping Ameri-
cans 
safe, 
our 
security 
personnel 
should not use apps that could com-
promise 
Federal 
Government 
data. 
There is always a threat that TikTok 
could be used to compromise govern-
ment devices, including those used in 
our airports and among our airport 
personnel. That is why this amendment 
is so important and why we should pass 
it without delay. 
Recently, the TSA announced a pro-
hibition 
on 
employees 
using 
or 
downloading TikTok on their govern-
ment-issued work phones, and my 
amendment would make this ban law. 
Other government agencies and depart-
ments have instituted a prohibition on 
the use of TikTok on government- 
issued phones including the U.S. Army, 
the State Department, and the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. 
TSA is right to institute this policy, 
especially as TikTok refuses to provide 
more transparency into some of its 
more controversial practices and use. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes’’ on my amendment to 
keep our government devices and our 
airports safe from potential foreign 
surveillance, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the bill, although I am not opposed to 
the amendment. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, as the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia has just stated, the administra-
tion has already taken some proactive 
steps to deal with this threat; however, 
we need to remain vigilant when it 
comes to dealing with counterintel-
ligence threats and concerns in the 
Federal workforce. I think this amend-
ment does that. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to support it, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I compliment the gentle-
woman from Virginia in offering this 
amendment. 
Recently, the intelligence commu-
nity raised national security concerns 
about the TikTok app and its ties to 
China. As we always and have been 
continuously informed, the Chinese are 
trying to get information on what we 
are doing every day of the week, every 
month, all the year. In response to 
this, TSA banned the use of TikTok by 
TSA employees on government-pro-
vided devices. 
Representative SPANBERGER’s amend-
ment is to be commended for recog-
nizing that national security concerns 
about this app and successor apps will 
not go away over time and for author-
izing this amendment to be codified in 
law. 
With that, Mr. Chairman, I urge my 
colleagues to support this amendment. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Chairman, I 
urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment and to continue protecting 
our Nation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 9 OFFERED BY MS. MUCARSEL- 
POWELL 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 9 printed in 
House Report 116–411. 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Chairman, I rise as the designee of Ms. 
SCHRIER, and I have an amendment at 
the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Add at the end the following: 
SEC. 7. PREVENTION AND PROTECTION AGAINST 
CERTAIN ILLNESS. 
The Administrator of the Transportation 
Security Administration, in coordination 
with the Director of Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention and the Director of the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, shall ensure that covered employ-
ees are provided proper guidance regarding 
prevention 
and 
protections 
against 
coronavirus, 
including 
appropriate 
re-
sources. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 877, the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Chairman, this amendment will ensure 
that the TSA Administrator works in 
coordination with the Directors of the 
Centers for Disease Control and the Na-
tional Institute of Allergy and Infec-
tious Diseases to ensure that TSA em-
ployees are provided the proper guid-
ance regarding prevention and protec-
tions against coronavirus, including 
appropriate resources. 
TSA employees are on the front lines 
of strengthening the safety of our 
transportation systems while ensuring 
the freedom of movement for people 
and commerce, which is why this un-
derlying legislation is so important. 
As part of their mission, TSA em-
ployees constantly come in close con-
tact with countless people every day 
from across the country and from 
around the world. This means that 
their potential risk and exposure to the 
virus is heightened. 
Our TSA employees work every day 
to protect us as we travel. In turn, we 
must do all we can to protect them 
while they are on the job. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this 
amendment and underlying bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, I claim the time in opposition to 
the amendment, although I am not op-
posed to it. 
The Acting CHAIR. Without objec-
tion, the gentleman is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair-
man, this amendment recognizes that 
the coronavirus is a serious public 
health threat and that the TSA has a 
responsibility to educate its personnel 
as to how they should protect them-
selves. I can’t imagine why anybody 
would oppose it. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL. 
Mr. 
Chairman, I am in agreement. I urge 
the support of this agreement, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentlewoman from Florida will be 
postponed. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Chairman, I move that the Committee 
do now rise. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. 
MUCARSEL-POWELL) 
having 
assumed 
the chair, Mr. BROWN of Maryland, Act-
ing Chair of the Committee of the 
Whole House on the state of the Union, 
reported that that Committee, having 
had under consideration the bill (H.R. 
1140) to enhance the security oper-
ations of the Transportation Security 
Administration and stability of the 
transportation security workforce by 
applying the personnel system under

ees of the Transportation Security Ad-
ministration who provide screening of

other purposes, had come to no resolu-
tion thereon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1515 
March 5, 2020 
Accordingly (at 9 o’clock and 57 min-
utes a.m.), the House stood in recess. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
speak in strong support of H.R. 1140, the 
Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act 
of 2020, which will create civil service protec-
tions for TSA employees that are long over-
due. 
H.R. 1140, mandates the conversion of all 
covered employees and positions within the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
to the provisions of title 5, United State Code. 
The bill represents a longstanding priority 
for Chairman THOMPSON, the bill’s author, and 
my own as a former chair of the Homeland 
Security Committee’s Subcommittee on Trans-
portation Security to extend the rights and pro-
tections afford to all federal government em-
ployees to TSA personnel. 
Several versions of the bill have been intro-
duced over the past decade, but this Con-
gress is the first time the bill has received 
overwhelming, bipartisan support, with 236 co-
sponsors including 10 Republicans. 
The legislation curtails TSA’s broad authori-
ties to create and control its personnel sys-
tems, instead requiring TSA to abide by the 
provisions of title 5 which regulate personnel 
systems for most Federal agencies. 
The bill would provide TSA employees with 
the workforce protections and benefits avail-
able to most other Federal workers. 
The bill sets forth transition rules to protect 
the rate of pay and other rights of TSA em-
ployees during a transition to title 5. 
The bill also requires the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to consult with the appro-
priate labor organizations to carry out the tran-
sition. 
This bill does not affect prohibitions against 
disloyalty and asserting the right to strike 
against the federal government. 
The bill also extends the timeline for the 
transition from 60 days to a more realistic 180 
days, and it contains language to protect em-
ployees with grievances or disciplinary actions 
pending during the transition. 
On the morning of September 11, 2001, 
nearly 3,000 people were killed in a series of 
coordinated terrorist attacks in New York, 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
The attacks resulted in the creation of the 
Transportation Security Administration, which 
was designed to prevent similar attacks in the 
future by removing the responsibility for trans-
portation security from private entities. 
The Aviation and Transportation Security 
Act, passed by the 107th Congress and 
signed on November 19, 2001, established 
TSA just 2 months following the September 
11, 2001 attacks. 
The urgent need to provide a response to 
the available security threat was facing meant 
that much of the work to provide administra-
tive structure and integration measures that 
would have woven in the civil service protec-
tions now be added did not occur at that time. 
The TSA’s mission is to protect the nation’s 
transportation systems to ensure freedom of 
movement for people and commerce. 
The work of the TSA is a frontline Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and it is not 
easy—it can in fact be very dangerous. 
Like many of my colleagues, I recall the 
shooting incident at LAX that killed Gerardo 
Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer 
killed in the line of duty; and the machete at-
tack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans 
International Airport that resulted in injuries to 
Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol 
Richel. 
These incidents only highlight the difficult 
work that the men and women of the TSA 
must perform each day to keep our nation’s 
airports and flights safe. 
The Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) supports several key parts of the U.S. 
coronavirus response. 
The TSA is responsible for: enforcing the 
travel restrictions for all flights that are car-
rying individuals who have recently traveled 
from China, notifying passengers and travelers 
of risks of contracting the virus, and coordi-
nating with air carriers and airports to discuss 
government actions and seek input (TSA). 
Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful 
procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, 
low morale, and security gaps within the 
Agency are causes for concern. 
TSA has consistently struggled with low mo-
rale across the workforce, ranking 303 out of 
305 government agencies in 2016. 
Low morale has a nexus to the high turn-
over rate within the ranks of Transportation 
Security Officers (TSOs). 
TSOs represent 70 percent of the TSA 
workforce, yet have been denied full collective 
bargaining rights, whistleblower protections, 
and opportunities to effectively raise issues in 
dispute to an independent third party, such as 
the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
Additionally, TSOs are subject to a pay and 
performance system that does not track with 
the General Services (GS) wage system, the 
primary wage system for Federal workers. 
It is past time to make the changes provided 
by H.R. 1140, so the TSA workforce is treated 
equally to other federal employees with the 
power to advance and expand their opportuni-
ties as government employees. 
Finally I am excited to support the Mucarsel- 
Powell amendment regarding infectious dis-
ease preparation and protection for TSOs, and 
the Cisneros Amendment that is very impor-
tant which requires the DHS to prioritize hiring 
veterans including disabled veterans and oth-
ers associated with veterans. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 1140.

So the amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
Stated for: 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chair, had 
I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 88. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, I was unavoid-
ably detained. Had I been present, I would 
have voted ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 88. 
The Acting CHAIR. There being no 
further amendments, under the rule, 
the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
NEGUSE) having assumed the chair, Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD, Acting Chair of the Com-
mittee of the Whole House on the state 
of the Union, reported that that Com-
mittee, having had under consideration 
the bill (H.R. 1140) to enhance the secu-
rity operations of the Transportation 
Security Administration and stability 
of the transportation security work-
force by applying the personnel system 
under title 5, United States Code, to 
employees of the Transportation Secu-
rity 
Administration 
who 
provide 
screening of all passengers and prop-
erty, and for other purposes, and, pur-
suant to House Resolution 877, he re-
ported the bill, as amended by that res-
olution, back to the House with sundry 
further amendments adopted in the 
Committee of the Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
further amendment reported from the 
Committee of the Whole? If not, the 
Chair will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentlewoman opposed to the bill? 
Mrs. LESKO. I am in its current 
form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mrs. Lesko moves to recommit the bill 
H.R. 1140 to the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity with instructions to report the same 
back to the House forthwith with the fol-
lowing amendment: 
Add at the end of section 4 the following: 
(c) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—During the 
transition period and after the conversion 
date, the Secretary shall ensure that the 
Transportation 
Security 
Administration 
continues to prevent the hiring of individ-
uals who have been convicted of a sex crime, 
an offense involving a minor, a crime of vio-
lence, or terrorism. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes in 
support of her motion. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I first 
want to say that the vast majority of 
TSA officers are good, hardworking 
professionals, but there are some bad 
actors. 
On February 6, 2020, the State of 
California announced the arrest and 
prosecution of a former TSA screener, 
resulting from an FBI investigation. 
According to the criminal complaint, 
the TSA screener used ‘‘fraud or deceit 
to falsely imprison a woman going 
through security’’ while stationed as a 
travel document checker at Los Ange-
les International Airport in June 2019. 
The screener insisted that the woman 
passenger needed extra screening in a 
private elevator, where he told the pas-
senger to reveal her ‘‘full breasts’’ and 
to ‘‘lift her pants and underwear.’’ The 
victim in the case stated that she com-
plied with the TSO’s instructions out 
of fear. 
Fortunately, this offender was imme-
diately fired by the TSA. However, 
under this bill, H.R. 1140, if it passed, 
this predator could be on the Federal 
payroll for months or even years. 
But this is not an isolated incident. 
In addition to the sexual predator at 
LAX, in the last 5 years alone, a 
screener in Boston was caught luring 
teenage girls into posing for nude 
photos; a screener at LaGuardia mo-
lested a female college student in the 
airport bathroom; and two screeners in 
Denver plotted to grope attractive 
men. 
My amendment is simple. It would 
enhance aviation security and protect 
the flying public by preventing the 
TSA from hiring any candidate with a 
history of sexual misconduct, offenses 
involving minors, or terrorism. 
This amendment is identical to an 
amendment offered by my Democratic 
colleague, Ms. UNDERWOOD, which was 
not offered here today. The Underwood 
amendment was made in order by the 
Rules Committee. The rule was sup-
ported by every Democrat in the 
House. 
Republicans strongly support the 
Underwood amendment. We were dis-
appointed we did not have an oppor-
tunity to vote on it earlier. 
The Underwood amendment preserves 
the authority TSA currently has to 
prevent the hiring of candidates with a 
history of sexual misconduct, offenses 
involving minors, or terrorism. 
The Underwood amendment is so im-
portant because current law bars a lit-
any of criminals from working in sen-
sitive roles at airports. The amend-
ment simply ensures that current safe-
guards remain in place. 
There is no reason that someone with 
a conviction for sexual assault or ter-
rorism should be a TSA employee. To 
be clear, the Underwood amendment, 
my amendment, would prevent the hir-
ing of sexual predators like Harvey 
Weinstein. 
We have two options today: adopt the 
Underwood amendment and keep sex-
ual predators off the Federal payroll, 
or reject it and reward sexual predators 
with a paycheck from the taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support the motion to recommit, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to this motion to recom-
mit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Florida is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, 47,000 
Transportation Security officers just 
heard the comments of my colleague, 
Mrs. LESKO, and many of them we will 
see today as we cast our votes and fly 
home to our districts. I am sure many 
people on this House floor will say, 
‘‘Thank you for your service,’’ to the 
47,000 men and women who do the jobs 
to keep the flying public safe every 
day. 
The behavior that Mrs. LESKO cited 
from LAX, that is offensive to, I am 
sure, everyone in this room. But let me 
be clear: There is nothing in this bill 
that will allow the TSA to hire individ-
uals who have been convicted of sex 
crimes or offenses against a minor, a 
crime of violence, or terrorism. 
And let me be clear. In the example, 
also, that she cited, there is nothing 
that would have precluded this person 
from being hired in the first place. The 
behavior took place after the person 
was hired. 
This is a red herring. We decided not 
to offer this amendment because it 
simply isn’t necessary. 
TSA conducts rigorous background 
checks and will continue to do so. 
Now, let me say this: I was assigned 
to the Orlando International Airport as 
a police captain during 9/11, and I did 
not come today to play political 
games, and neither did the 242 cospon-
sors of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, let me make this clear. 
A vote for this motion to recommit is 
a vote against the Transportation Se-
curity officers. They are the frontline

workers who worked through a govern-
ment shutdown, without being paid, to 
keep America safe. They are still show-
ing up today, each of them interacting 
with thousands of passengers even as 
we face a public health crisis. 
Today, you have a choice: move this 
bill forward and provide TSOs the basic 
rights and benefits they deserve, or 
deny them those rights. It is just that 
simple. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we have a bipar-
tisan solution that will allow us to en-
sure that the workforce gets the same 
compensation, benefits, and protec-
tions as are available to most other 
Federal employees. It is about time 
that the TSA Federal workforce be 
treated like Federal employees. 
This is the time not to just say, ‘‘We 
appreciate you,’’ but to show them how 
much we appreciate them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote against this motion and in sup-
port of the bill on final passage. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- 
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by a 5-minute vote 
on passage of the bill, if ordered.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, unfortu-
nately, on March 5, 2020, I was not able to 
cast my votes during the vote series due to a 
family emergency. Had I been in attendance, 
I would have voted: 
1. YES on Amendment No. 7, CISNEROS (D– 
CA)—Requires the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity to prioritize the hiring of veterans and 
related preference eligible individuals, includ-
ing disabled veterans and widows or widowers 
of veterans, for positions within the Transpor-
tation Security Administration; 
2. YES on Amendment No. 9, MUCARSEL- 
POWELL (D–FL) [on behalf of SCHRIER (D– 
WA)]—Would ensure the Administrator of TSA 
in coordination with the Director of CDC and 
NIAID shall ensure that TSA employees are 
provided the proper guidance regarding pre-
vention and protections against coronavirus, 
including guidance and resources; 
3. NO on Republican Motion to Recommit; 
and 
4. YES on Final Passage of H.R. 1140— 
Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act 
of 2020. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to 
vote due to extenuating circumstances. Had I 
been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 87, ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 88, ‘‘nay’’ 
on rollcall No. 89, and ‘‘yea’’ on rollcall No. 90. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I 
was not present at votes on Thursday, March 
5, as I was travelling back to Washington state 
to meet with coronavirus response leaders. 
Had I been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ 
on Roll Call No. 87 (Cisneros Amendment), 
‘‘yea’’ on Roll Call No. 88 (Mucarsel-Powell/ 
Schrier Amendment), ‘‘nay’’ on Roll Call No. 
89 (Motion to Recommit), and ‘‘yea’’ on Roll 
Call No. 90 (Final passage of H.R. 1140) be-
cause the bill strengthens workplace rights for 
Transportation Security Officers, improving job 
conditions, and enhancing the security of the 
traveling public. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, from 
Monday, March 2, to Thursday, March 5, I 
was not able to make the recorded votes 
below. Had I been present, I would have

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to indicate I was unavoidably de-
tained in a committee hearing and un-
able to register my vote for the 
Cisneros amendment protecting vet-
erans and having a focus of hiring vet-
erans under the legislation H.R. 1140, 
Rights for Transportation Security Of-
ficers Act of 2020, I ask that my vote of 
‘‘aye’’ be placed in the RECORD at the 
appropriate place.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1520 
March 5, 2020 
We will consider several bills under 
suspension of the rules. The complete 
list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow. 
The House will consider H.R. 2214, the 
NO BAN Act. This bill would repeal the 
President’s Muslim travel ban and pre-
vent the administration from putting 
in place other discriminatory travel 
bans. 
In addition, the House will consider 
H.R. 5581, Access to Counsel Act. This 
legislation would make certain that 
those held or detained while attempt-
ing to enter the United States are 
guaranteed access to legal counsel. 
That legal counsel, Mr. Speaker, would 
not be paid for by the government. 
The current FISA authorization ex-
pires March 15, requiring action in this 
House. Conversations are ongoing, and 
I hope to bring legislation to the floor 
next week. 
Lastly, following Senate passage of 
Senator KAINE’s bipartisan War Powers 
resolution, it is possible that the House 
could also consider the resolution as 
early as next week. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
In relation to the NO BAN Act, I un-
derstand there was a disagreement over 
whether or not the gentleman sup-
ported the President’s ability to re-
strict travel from certain countries 
based, not on whether they were a Mus-
lim country, but based on whether or 
not they were a country that was not 
in compliance with our Department of 
Homeland Security requirements and 
criteria to ensure that they are prop-
erly vetting people who come to our 
country for national security purposes 
and, specifically, to ensure that people 
who are known terrorists and people 
who have other known criminal back-
grounds are not able to come into our 
country. 
Most countries around the world, in-
cluding a number of Muslim countries, 
are in compliance and, in fact, have a 
very good cooperative travel agree-
ment between the United States and 
those countries, but there were a lim-
ited number of countries back in 2017 
that the President ultimately deter-
mined, working through the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, were not 
in compliance. 
He listed those countries. He added a 
few more to it later. I know a number 
of people on the majority side were in 
disagreement with that. Some took 
that to court. It ultimately went all 
the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court upheld this travel 
ban. 
But I would want to point out to the 
gentleman that the Department of 
Homeland Security has been very clear 
to these countries that if they comply 
with 
the 
basic 
reporting 
require-
ments—again, that every other coun-
try in the world that has that same 
travel agreement with the United 
States has—if they were to come into 
compliance, then they would be re-
moved from the list. 
In fact, Chad is one of the countries 
that was originally listed. Chad worked 
with us—as every country should—and 
said: We are going to comply. We want 
to make sure that we are properly 
sharing information so that people who 
are coming to the United States from 
Chad now are properly vetted for ter-
rorism and other criminal activities. 
They got removed from the list. 
The other countries, by the way, 
have been invited to do that. They 
have chosen not to. Why they have 
chosen not to is a good question they 
should be asked. We should not criti-
cize the President for using his execu-
tive authority to keep this country 
safe and to keep terrorists from coming 
into this country and ensuring that 
those nations that send people to the 
United States—as we send them to 
their 
countries—are 
in 
compliance 
with the requirements of the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security. 
So why would a bill like that be 
brought up, especially at this time 
when now with this coronavirus there 
are a number of countries that we have 
seen, starting with China, that have a 
serious outbreak that we are trying to 
prevent from coming into our country? 
Under this bill that would be coming 
forward, not only does it limit the 
President’s ability to protect us from 
having countries be able to send terror-
ists into our Nation, now it would limit 
the President’s ability to respond to a 
health 
crisis 
like 
the 
coronavirus 
where there are some countries that 
are listed, like China and Iran, that 
have to be screened or can’t send peo-
ple from those countries if they have 
been in those countries in the last 14 
days, it would tie the President’s hands 
from even responding to that crisis. 
We have seen just today the Gov-
ernor 
of 
California—probably 
not 
somebody 
who 
is 
philosophically 
aligned with the President too often— 
just sent a cruise ship back into the 
Pacific Ocean and said the cruise ship 
can’t come into San Francisco. And 
that is the Governor’s power and au-
thority to provide for the health and 
safety of his State. 
Why would we want to tie the hands 
of the President of the United States 
when he wants to ensure the health and 
safety of the people of this country? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I will give a relatively short answer. 
First of all, there is nobody in this 
House on either side of the aisle—cer-
tainly none of the proponents of this 
legislation—who want to in any way 
limit the President’s ability to protect 
America, whether it is from terrorists, 
whether it is from the coronavirus or 
some other threat that manifestly pre-
sents itself to the safety and well-being 
of the American people. 
b 1145 
What the bill attempts to do is sim-
ply to preclude violating, in effect, the 
Constitution of the United States in ei-
ther making a religious test for admis-
sion to the United States of America, 
which, very frankly, a number of state-
ments of the President would indicate 
that, in the past, that was what he in-
tended to do and, in fact, was manifest 
in the very broad reach, unrelated to 
whether somebody was a terrorist but 
related to what their religion was or 
some other distinction unrelated. 
Now, obviously, both the health and 
safety of the American people would 
not preclude the President from acting 
to protect that. I think we would all 
agree on that. But, clearly, we believe 
the President has, in fact, gone far be-
yond specific ways and means to pro-
tect the American people and simply 
preclude people, as I said, of a par-
ticular religion, a particular nation-
ality, or some other broad base unre-
lated to the specific items to which you 
referred, with which I think most of us 
agree. 
Of course, we will debate that next 
week. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, clearly, 
we will debate that because the Su-
preme Court has already addressed the 
constitutionality upholding it, but it 
has no genesis in religious tests. It has 
a genesis in the security of this coun-
try. 
Again, if you go look at the nations 
that are listed in the ban, Chad went 
and did the things that the Department 
of Homeland Security said you needed 
to do to be in compliance, and they got 
removed from the list. 
Every other country on that list has 
also been invited to go and just do 
basic sharing of information to ensure 
that the people coming from those 
countries are not terrorists, are not 
criminals, are not going to provide a 
security threat to our Nation. 
It is a clear test. Every other country 
in the world already does it. 
Why does Libya choose not to com-
ply? I don’t know, but they haven’t. 
Why does North Korea choose not to 
comply? 
I 
don’t 
know, 
but 
they 
haven’t. 
Like Chad, go and address these defi-
ciencies, and then you can be removed 
from the list. Chad has already done 
that. Every other country can. 
We will debate it, but it does put ad-
ditional red tape in front of the Presi-
dent that would preclude him in the 
health arena from responding to the 
nations that have a threat of the 
coronavirus, like the President was 
quickly able to do with China, quickly 
able to do with Iran. He would not be 
able to quickly respond in the future 
under the bill that is proposed. 
Clearly, we will heavily debate that 
next week. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
assure the gentleman that it is our 
view that nothing in this legislation 
will preclude the President of the 
United States from acting, either on 
the basis of national security or the se-
curity of our people, either from 
threats of terrorism or from health, or

for some other identifiable threat to 
the American people. 
This simply says that he cannot act 
based upon the generalization that 
somebody is a Muslim, somebody is 
from this country, somebody is from a 
different nationality or different reli-
gion, or some other arbitrary distinc-
tion. He has to focus on specific rea-
sons. 
In China’s case, for instance, we 
know that China has a very large out-
break of coronavirus and that it poses 
a proximate threat to the health not 
only of the American people but of peo-
ple around the world and that we need 
to take steps to ensure that that is 
contained. 
So, we will debate that next week, 
but we certainly don’t accept the 
premise that the gentleman has just 
stated, that somehow we will limit the 
President from protecting the Amer-
ican people for legitimate and nec-
essary reasons. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, clearly, 
we do have disagreements on that. 
Hopefully, we can work through those 
in the debate next week. 
There is another bill that is going to 
be, hopefully, coming up that we can 
get agreement on, and that deals with 
the renewal of components of the FISA 
law. 
I know the Committee on the Judici-
ary earlier this week had a markup 
that they ultimately pulled back on. 
There are negotiations ongoing be-
tween Republicans and Democrats to 
try to come to an agreement on not 
only how to renew the FISA law, but 
also how to make the reforms that are 
critical and necessary to the FISA law, 
to address the abuses that we know 
happen. 
I would ask the gentleman first if his 
side is in a position of identifying some 
of the areas we can find agreement on, 
on reforms, because I believe Ranking 
Member NUNES had submitted a num-
ber of specific reforms, and the gentle-
man’s side is reviewing those. 
Has the gentleman had a chance to 
review them? Does he have an alter-
native proposal? Because the reforms 
are critical to the renewal. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
to answer that. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to tell the gentleman 
that, this morning or late last night, 
we sent a response to your offer, and 
the committees now have that in their 
possession. I see they are shaking their 
heads that they may not think that we 
did it, but we did. We have already sent 
a response to your offer, with reference 
to the reforms. 
As the gentleman knows, we have 
agreed on a number of items as, frank-
ly, the person that dealt with the per-
son who had your job previously, ROY 
BLUNT and I, with Senator Bond, also 
from 
Missouri, 
as 
is 
now-Senator 
BLUNT but then-Minority Whip BLUNT, 
and Jay Rockefeller from West Vir-
ginia. We worked on the reauthoriza-
tion of FISA in 2008, and we received 
broad bipartisan support. I am hopeful 
that we can do that. 
This bill, as the gentleman knows, 
the authorization for section 215 ex-
pires on March 15. The Attorney Gen-
eral, as the gentleman knows, rec-
ommended that we pass a clean reau-
thorization. 
Obviously, both sides felt that there 
were some things they wanted to deal 
with, and we are doing that now. Hope-
fully, we can get this done. 
Mr. Speaker, I will assure the gen-
tleman that, once we have agreement, 
I will bring that bill to the floor. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate that the gentleman talked about 
a response. I haven’t seen that response 
yet, but I look forward to working with 
our folks who are heavily involved in 
these negotiations to see if we can 
reach agreement because, in the past, 
the program has had many supporters, 
Republican and Democrat, but clearly 
some detractors on both sides as well. 
It is a very critical tool in our na-
tional security. The FISA courts have 
been used to stop terrorist activity, to 
prevent other terrorist attacks, but 
there is clearly other weighing that 
goes back and forth on civil liberties 
and ensuring that the rights of Ameri-
cans are protected. 
It is a balance that was tested, frank-
ly, in 2016, when we saw clear abuses of 
the FISA court. The first time we had 
seen those kinds of identified abuses, 
they were limited, but they were bla-
tant. It is a dangerous affront to our 
Nation’s national security if you have 
people at intelligence agencies who 
abuse their power. 
In fact, the Horowitz report was very 
specific in outlining 17 different exact 
abuses of the FISA court. Some of this 
is still being investigated through the 
Durham 
investigation, 
which 
will, 
hopefully, yield a list of specific peo-
ple. 
I will just read from parts of the 
Horowitz report. 
‘‘As more fully described in Chapter 
5, based upon the information known 
to the FBI in October 2016, the first ap-
plication contained the following seven 
significant 
inaccuracies 
and 
omis-
sions.’’ 
He goes on in this report: ‘‘In addi-
tion to repeating the seven significant 
errors contained in the first FISA ap-
plication and outlined above, we iden-
tified 10 additional significant errors 
and three renewal applications, based 
upon information known to the FBI 
after the first application and before 
the renewals,’’ where abuses of this 
FISA law occurred. 
Now, I think, on both sides, we would 
agree that if somebody in a position of 
national security abuses their power 
deliberately, they need to be held ac-
countable. One of the concerns we have 
is that the law does not allow strong 
enough penalties. 
I am hopeful that, when the Durham 
report comes out, the people who were 
identified as abusing their power in 
2016 ought to be held accountable and, 
in fact, ought to go to jail for what 
they did because what they did not 
only undermined our electoral process, 
but it jeopardizes a law that has bipar-
tisan support but has bipartisan oppo-
sition as well. 
If somebody abused their power to 
taint that process, the FISA court, it 
undermines the integrity of the FISA 
court. We all need to work together to 
ensure that anyone who abuses their 
power is held fully accountable, not 
only to hold them accountable, but to 
ensure it doesn’t happen again. No Re-
publican, no Democrat candidate for 
President ought to be concerned that 
people in intelligence agencies are 
abusing their power to try to under-
mine an election. 
If it happened, as we know it did— 
and the Horowitz report is very spe-
cific. Hopefully, the Durham investiga-
tion names names. Hopefully, those 
people are held accountable and go to 
jail so that nobody else does it again. 
But as we know, there is the possi-
bility for that to happen under current 
law. That is why it is so important 
that we get this agreement to make 
necessary 
critical 
reforms, 
to 
put 
guardrails in place; to keep the process 
available to our national security ex-
perts so that they can continue to stop 
future terrorist attacks; but to also en-
sure that if somebody abuses the proc-
ess, it makes it harder for them to do 
it; but if they still cross the line, that 
there are strong criminal penalties in 
place for those who would violate that 
law. 
I know we have laid those out. I am 
glad to know you have come back with 
a response. Hopefully, we can get that 
agreement in the next few days before 
this law expires. Clearly, there is 
strong support, hopefully, on both 
sides, for putting real reforms in place 
that fix and address the abuses that oc-
curred in 2016, as identified by the 
Horowitz report. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
for anything else on that. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, somewhat 
like the recitation of the Mueller re-
port that has been quoted—the Mueller 
report, of course, found substantial 
reason to believe that there was wrong-
doing. It was projected by the Attorney 
General and others that the Mueller re-
port was a conclusion that the Presi-
dent or others had not done something 
wrong. That was not the fact. 
In any event, with respect to the gen-
tleman’s comments, with respect to 
what was done by the FBI, it should 
not have been done, obviously. 
But the gentleman didn’t read this 
very important sentence from the in-
spector general’s report regarding the 
court’s decision: ‘‘We did not find docu-
mentary or testimonial evidence that 
political bias or improper motivation 
influenced his decision,’’ meaning the 
court’s decision, the judge’s decision. 
The bill that we are talking about is 
reauthorizing section 215. None of this 
deals with section 215. It deals with 
metadata on which the parties have an

agreement. It also deals with business 
records and issues of lone wolves, who 
are not necessarily associated with a 
terrorist organization but present a 
danger to the United States. 
There are reforms that we can pursue 
to ensure that the FISA court gets all 
the information that it needs and, in 
fact, has a representative who makes 
sure that they get that and who is not 
associated with, necessarily, the law 
enforcement officers or intelligence of-
ficers who are presenting information 
to the FISA court. 
Unfortunately, and I want to say can-
didly, Mr. Speaker, the President’s 
focus on the Page case and distracting 
from the issues that we are dealing 
with—Attorney 
General 
Barr 
rec-
ommended that we reauthorize the 
FISA section 215 as is. That is what the 
Attorney 
General 
recommended. 
I 
don’t know what his present position is 
because he was criticized by the Presi-
dent in a tweet, so heaven knows what 
he did in response to the tweet. 
But the fact of the matter is, the 
issues which the gentleman raises, we 
all want appropriate, honest disclosure 
from individuals who present to the 
FISA court. That is not an issue, and 
we ought to pursue reforms that lead 
to that end. But in this case, the focus 
on an issue unrelated to section 215, 
which we are really talking about, is 
slowing up this process. And I would 
hope that in the coming days, because 
the 15th is upon us, we come to an 
agreement. 
As I said, we sent an offer back, Mr. 
Whip. Hopefully, we will hear back 
from you and, hopefully, reach agree-
ment in the near term because this is 
an important thing to pass, to reau-
thorize for the security of our people. 
The gentleman was talking about se-
curity before. We need to make sure 
that we act in a bipartisan way to en-
sure that the FISA process is working 
and working properly. 
b 1200 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, clearly, 
the gentleman from Maryland and I 
both agree that this FISA law has a 
strong role to play in our national se-
curity, but there is also acknowledg-
ment that there were abuses that hap-
pened. Not only was there the Horowitz 
investigation, but now you do have the 
Durham investigation that will, hope-
fully, conclude and identify where 
those abuses took place and that those 
people would be held accountable. 
We have had talks with the Attorney 
General, who recognizes, yes, he also 
agrees that this FISA law is critically 
important, wants to have this section 
renewed, but he does recognize that re-
forms can be made. 
How exactly we can come to an 
agreement—just like with your side, 
we are having those negotiations. And 
so, if people do acknowledge that 
abuses occurred, I think it would be in 
all of our best interest, as we are ad-
dressing this law that has had detrac-
tors on both sides, that we strengthen 
the integrity of the law, because it has 
been exposed now. It has been exposed 
that there were problems that oc-
curred. 
The other sections where those prob-
lems occurred are permanent law. This 
is not. This is coming up for renewal, 
but it is part of the FISA law. And, 
clearly, as we debate the FISA law, all 
of this becomes part of that debate, 
and, hopefully, all of it can get re-
solved within the debate on the compo-
nents that expire March 15. 
I am confident we can get this done 
because I have seen the bipartisan in-
terest. We just need to make sure that 
what we bring to the floor addresses 
the problems that occurred so that it, 
hopefully, never happens again. 
I will be happy to yield if the gen-
tleman had anything else on that. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I don’t 
have anything further to say. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I look 
forward to seeing the gentleman next 
week, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

BIPARTISAN CORONAVIRUS 
LEGISLATION 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to praise my House colleagues 
for their swift and decisive action to 
attack the corona threat yesterday. 
Members of both parties recognized 
that this disease is a national and pub-
lic health crisis, that it will affect all 
Americans, 
regardless 
of 
political 
party. We came together to approve 
$7.8 billion to protect the safety and 
well-being 
of 
all 
Americans. 
The 
Founding Fathers created this Cham-
ber for exactly that reason. 
In the spirit of bipartisan coopera-
tion, I would like to discuss the Afford-
able Care Act. Like our coronavirus 
bill yesterday, the ACA attacked a 
public health crisis. It improved the 
health and security of millions of 
Americans, especially those with pre-
existing conditions. It has saved money 
for American workers, and it has 
helped millions of American families 
provide care for their children. 
If these attacks on the ACA are suc-
cessful, at least 25 million Americans 
will be uninsured. We do not want 
them 
to 
avoid 
screenings 
for 
coronavirus or future viruses because 
they cannot afford it.

CONGRATULATING LINDSEY 
BORDAS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Lindsey 
Bordas, 
a 
senior 
at 
Philipsburg-Osceola High School. 
Recently, Lindsey accepted a fully 
qualified appointment to the United 
States 
Military 
Academy 
in 
West 
Point, New York. Lindsey is a leader in 
the classroom and in her community. 
She is her senior class salutatorian and 
class president. 
Lindsey is also an active member of 
her school’s fly-fishing club and her 
church youth group. Her determination 
and drive will make her an excellent 
addition to the military academy, and 
I am confident she will rise to the occa-
sion and excel during her education 
and in her service to our country. 
I would like to thank Lindsey for her 
commitment and her willingness to 
serve, and I wish her all the best in this 
exciting new chapter.

RECOGNIZING BILL BALLEZA 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
today I recognize Bill Balleza, a KPRC 
2 anchor, who, for nearly 50 years, has 
been a reliable source of daily news for 
our community. 
Bill has been seen on TV screens 
across our city for years, where he re-
ported on thousands of stories, did a 
weekly child segment from 1985 to 1995, 
and earned an Emmy Award for his re-
porting. 
Not only has he served our commu-
nity as a distinguished journalist and 
anchor, but he is also a proud Vietnam 
veteran. He is a common sight at the 
Veteran’s Day celebration and parade 
every year. 
We thank Bill for his service. In the 
days of fake news and attacks on the 
media, he has always been above the 
fray and a trusted source. We will miss 
seeing him on the TV screen when we 
tune into KPRC 2 for the daily news. 
For now, he should enjoy his retire-
ment. He has earned it. And God bless.

JOHN WESLEY UNITED METHODIST 
CHURCH CELEBRATES 180TH AN-

(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given

marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to recognize the John Wes-
ley United Methodist Church in Cape 
May Courthouse in south Jersey on 
their 180th anniversary celebration this 
year. 
John 
Wesley 
United 
Methodist 
Church is the oldest African American 
church in all of Cape May County. 
John Wesley founded the church in 1840 
after escaping slavery in North Caro-
lina in 1823. 
The church also is home to a ceme-
tery, where there are veterans from the 
Civil War all the way to the Vietnam 
war. 
I was proud to attend the celebration 
event on Saturday, February 29. In ad-

HONORING NELLA LARSEN 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this is 
Women’s History Month. I rise to rec-
ognize Nella Larsen, who was born in 
Chicago in 1891. Her mother was a Dan-
ish immigrant and her father an immi-
grant from the Danish West Indies, 
what is now known as the U.S. Virgin 
Islands. 
Larsen attended school in all-White 
environments in Chicago until she 
moved to Nashville to attend high 
school. She later practiced nursing, 
served as a librarian in the New York 
Public Library, and, after resigning 
from that position, she began a literary 
career. 
Her first novel, ‘‘Quicksand,’’ won 
her 
a 
Harmon 
Foundation 
bronze 
medal. After the publication of her sec-
ond novel, ‘‘Passing,’’ in 1929, Larsen 
was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, 
a first for an African American woman, 
establishing her as a premier novelist 
of the Harlem Renaissance. 
She died in New York in 1964. 
Her work explored the complex issues 
of racial identity and identification in 
her fiction. Though critics remain con-
flicted about her novels, ‘‘Quicksand’’ 
and ‘‘Passing,’’ there can be no ques-
tion 
that 
they 
are 
significant, 
groundbreaking 
American 
literary 
texts. She received a number of awards 
for her writing. 
Along with her contemporary, nov-
elist Zora Neale Hurston, Larsen is 
considered to be one of the most impor-
tant female voices in the Harlem Ren-
aissance. We remember her voice now. 
f 
HONORING VIRGINIA MILITARY 
INSTITUTE FULBRIGHT SCHOLARS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, Virginia 
Military Institute is world renowned 
for many achievements, but I rise 
today to recognize VMI for producing 
one of the highest numbers of Ful-
bright Scholars, nationally, for the 
2019–2020 academic year. This world-re-
nowned program seeks to improve cul-
tural relationships through the ex-
change of students, faculty, and ideas. 
The three bright individuals to re-
ceive this prestigious honor are Second 
Lieutenant Annika Tice, Colonel How-
ard Sanborn, and Colonel Geoff Jensen. 
One of only 2,200 students who re-
ceived a scholarship last year, Second 
Lieutenant Tice used her Fulbright to 
educate others and taught English in 
the Ivory Coast. 
Colonel Sanborn, a professor of inter-
national studies and political science, 
used this opportunity to study legisla-
tive politics in Hong Kong. 
Colonel Jensen, a professor of his-
tory, will conduct research in Madrid 
this coming summer. 
Sanborn and Jensen were among only 
470 faculty to receive a Fulbright dis-
tinction this year. 
With more colleges and universities 
than nearly any other district in the 
country, I am proud that these three 
individuals exemplify the talent that 
the Sixth District attracts. 
Congratulations to VMI on this note-
worthy accomplishment. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE WOUNDED 
WARRIOR PROGRAM 
(Mr. KILDEE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Wounded Warrior Pro-
gram, which is a bipartisan initiative 
that provides opportunities for injured 
veterans and servicemembers to con-
tinue their service to our country by 
working right here in the United 
States Congress. 
I am proud to have passed legisla-
tion, supported by Republicans and 
Democrats, to expand the Wounded 
Warrior Program. By investing in these 
paid fellowships, we can expand job op-
portunities for veterans and bring, im-
portantly, their critical insight to the 
work that we do right here in Congress. 
For the past 2 years, I have had the 
distinct privilege of having a Wounded 
Warrior fellow, Danielle Stevens, in my 
office. Throughout her time in my of-
fice, she has served my district by ad-
vising me on important legislation and, 
very importantly, being an advocate 
for veterans in casework that she has 
been involved in, including veterans 
who lost earned benefits, had them 
taken away from them due to clerical 
errors. Danielle Stevens was able to 
work to get those benefits restored, 
changing the lives of those families. 
Later this week, she will be leaving 
my office to continue her public serv-
ice at the U.S. Marshals Service. I 
thank her for her service to our coun-
try. This is an example of the success 
of this program.

REMEMBERING COLONEL 
(RETIRED) RONALD LORD 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LESKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with great sadness over the pass-
ing of Colonel Ronald Lord from Good-
year, Arizona, a loving husband to 
Mayor Georgia Lord of the city of 
Goodyear, which is in my district. He 
was a caring and kind father, grand-
father, and great-grandfather, and he 
was loved by many. 
While serving as a fighter pilot in the 
United States Air Force during the 
Vietnam 
war, 
he 
bravely 
fought 
against 
hostile 
North 
Vietnamese 
forces. Ron was an American hero, and 
we are eternally grateful for his serv-
ice. 
On behalf of the Arizona Eighth Con-
gressional District, I extend my deep-
est condolences to Ron’s family and 
loved ones as they mourn their loss.

CONGRATULATING SHAKOPEE 
HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLING TEAM 
(Ms. CRAIG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, today I 
would 
like 
to 
congratulate 
the 
Shakopee High School wrestling team, 
who repeated as class 3A State cham-
pions for the second year in a row. 
Congratulations to the wrestlers for 
the hard work that went into preparing 
for this perfect season. The dedication 
they have demonstrated is unparal-
leled, and their success is well de-
served. 
Also, thank you to the parents, the 
coaches, the teachers, and the mentors 
who dedicate their time, because they 
are equally committed to the team’s 
success and future. 
Congratulations to the team, and 
may they enjoy this moment. They 
have earned it.

JUNE MEDICAL SERVICES V. 
RUSSO 
(Ms. SCHAKOWSKY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to remind my colleagues of what is 
at stake at the Supreme Court in com-
ing weeks. 
Yesterday, the Court began to hear 
arguments in a major abortion rights 
case, June Medical Services v. Russo. 
If the Louisiana law in question goes 
into effect, only one clinic remains in 
the entire State. Only one physician 
would continue to provide abortion 
services to the 10,000 women who seek 
them every year. That outcome would 
deny thousands of women in Louisiana 
their constitutional protection: the 
protected right to access abortion care. 
In 2016, the Court already decided 
that an identical case was unconstitu-
tional. But since President Trump has 
added two conservative Justices to the 
Supreme Court, it is more important 
than ever for us to speak out about 
what is at stake, and I am proud to do 
that today. 
The Court should not uphold the 
Louisiana law and should overturn it.

RECOGNIZING BILL GAERTNER 
(Mr. TRONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bill Gaertner for re-
ceiving the distinguished St. Dismas 
Award for his work through the Gate-
keepers Re-Entry Program in Hagers-
town, Maryland. 
Gatekeepers is a program that ad-
dresses one of the top needs in our 
criminal justice system: support for re-
turning citizens. 
Today, 90 percent of incarcerated 
people get released into their own com-
munities, but many struggle to find 
the resources and support to thrive. 
A returning citizen himself, Bill was 
70 years old when he was released from 
prison. He started the Gatekeepers or-
ganization when he realized the chal-
lenges those released from prison face 
as they reenter society. 
Gatekeepers aims to provide a con-
nection to resources so folks could be 
successful as they transition back into 
their communities. 
We should all be working toward a 
more just criminal justice system. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Bill 
Gaertner on this much-deserved award 
for his work to support justice-im-
pacted communities.

RECOGNIZING HEROISM OF ROB-
ERT 
TARLETON 
AND 
EDWARD 
RYER 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was

for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the heroism of 
two New Jersey State troopers, Troop-
er Robert Tarleton and State Police 
Lieutenant Edward Ryer. 
On March 2, Trooper Tarleton was 
stopped and talking with a driver on I– 
287 in Bridgewater, New Jersey, when a 
tractor-trailer ran off the road, hit a 
structure, and burst into flames. 
Trooper Tarleton immediately ran 
toward the scene, where he met Lieu-
tenant Ryer, who was off-duty but had 
stopped to help. 
With no thought to their personal 
safety, they grabbed the incapacitated 
driver from the wreckage, dragging 
him to safety seconds before the truck 
exploded. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Trooper 
Tarleton and Lieutenant Ryer for their 
selfless actions that saved a man’s life. 
I also want to take a moment to rec-
ognize the everyday acts of heroism by 
our law enforcement officers that may 
not make the news or be captured on a 
body cam, as this one was. 
We call them when we need help, and 
no matter how dangerous the situa-
tion, they always come. We are grate-
ful. 
TIME TO RAISE ENDOMETRIOSIS 
AWARENESS AND FUNDING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Iowa 
(Ms. 
FINKENAUER) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on my Special 
Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it is 
an honor to represent the great State 
of Iowa and the First Congressional 
District. 
We have been getting a lot of great 
things done here in the House, working 
across the aisle and moving a lot of bi-
partisan bills forward since I got sworn 
in over a year ago. It has been an honor 
to get to represent my district and 
have its back every day. 
In the middle of all of this, I happen 
to have gotten engaged a couple of 
months ago to my very kind and sup-
portive fiance, who is sitting up there 
in the gallery right now. He has been 
there through so much of it, and I am 
grateful every day. 
You see, we are very much looking 
forward to one day starting our life to-
gether and are talking about raising a 
family and doing it in Iowa and how 
much that means to us. 
So it would surprise most folks to 
know that just about 4 weeks ago, on a 
Friday after votes, I was back where I 
stay in D.C., sitting on my bed, doubled 
over in pain, googling hysterectomies. 
It was a pain familiar to me, stabbing 
in my lower left abdomen, and a tight 
pain like two fists clenched together in 
a vise grip in my lower back. 
I know this pain well because I have 
been experiencing it intermittently for 
over the past decade because I have a 
condition called endometriosis. I have 
had this most of my adult life. 
I was diagnosed at a young age, luck-
ily, at the early age of 18. See, a lot of 
women don’t get an accurate diagnosis 
until much later in life. 
Endometriosis is a very painful con-
dition where the tissue that normally 
lines the uterus grows outside and can 
even attach to organs and nerves. 
Endometriosis is also the number one 
cause of hysterectomies for women 
ages 30 to 35. 
I have already had two surgeries, 
laparoscopies, where they went in and 
cut off or burnt off the tissue. I have 
white-knuckled my way through more 
flights, events, and days knocking on 
doors than I can count. 
There are so many women out there 
who have been told that the stabbing 
pain in your lower left abdomen is nor-
mal, or they are told that the tightness 
in their lower back that they are dou-
bled over with in their beds is normal, 
but none of that is normal. 
On this particular day, 4 weeks ago, I 
felt like I had enough. So I sat there, 
frustrated at the prospect of more 
delays in the airport in severe pain. I 
was looking at some of the most ex-
treme options that are out there that 
would mean I couldn’t even have chil-
dren. 
And to be honest with you, I just got 
frustrated because it shouldn’t be this 
hard. It should be more well known, 
and there should be more options for 
treatment. 
As I was looking up hysterectomies, I 
came across a place called the Endo-
metriosis Foundation of America, and 
their website was full of information, 
some that I didn’t even know as some-
body who has been living with this for 
over 10 years, like the fact that endo-
metriosis affects 1 in 10 women world-
wide and an estimated 7 to 10 million 
in the United States alone, or that it is 
the leading cause of infertility, but 
there is no known cure. 
You see, when I was looking up 
hysterectomies, the reason there are 
not more options, or options are slow 
to come by is because it is also one of 
the least-funded diseases and condi-
tions by Congress, by the National In-
stitutes of Health. 
So once I decided to start talking 
about this, the number of people, 
whether it is their staff who has it, or 
their sister who has it, or possibly 
somebody they work with every day, or 
people they have met on the campaign, 
I mean, it just goes on and on, the 
number of people this touched, the 
women who have it and the men and 
women who love them. 
I was also reminded, as I decided to 
look into this, how lucky I am. You 
see, I am lucky that I had a mom who 
believed me, who believed my pain, and 
good health insurance from my dad’s 
union, where we could go to doctor 
after doctor after doctor until finally 
somebody said: ‘‘Hey, she might have 
this. We better take a look at it.’’ That 
is when, again, I was able to be diag-
nosed. 
I am lucky to have great support 
from my staff and others. But there are 
so many women across the United 
States who don’t have that support. 
When I decided to talk about this 
just a few weeks ago, I was actually 
getting my hair trimmed, and my hair-
dresser heard me say the word ‘‘endo-
metriosis.’’ She looked at me, and she 
said: Do you have it? 
I said: Yes, I have it. 
And she said: Well, right now, I am 
feeling like I am being stabbed in my 
lower left abdomen. 
I said: Yes, I know that pain. 
She was working three jobs, and she 
is dealing with it every day. It is some-
thing where she doesn’t have the lux-
ury to not show up. Many women don’t. 
You just push through it, and you get 
through that pain day in and day out.

H1525 
March 5, 2020 
I know there are so many women 
hearing this today who may be hearing 
their pain described for the very first 
time, and that is why I want to make 
sure that I give a voice to them today 
and say that it is okay to talk about 
this. That is why I decided to do what 
I am doing today. 
See, I am in this position with a plat-
form as a Member of Congress, and I 
can talk about this important issue 
that touches so many women across 
the U.S. 
To be honest with you, I didn’t say 
anything for years because I was afraid 
that people would think I was weak, 
that I couldn’t do my job, but that is 
not true. I show up every day; I have 
done it for the last decade. I have rep-
resented my State and my District 
well, and it is not weak to talk about 
it. 
In fact, the women who are living 
with it every day, they are strong as 
heck. It is time that people across the 
country know about what this is. 
Every 
day, 
women 
are 
pushing 
through their pain and living their 
lives. They are not weak; they are 
strong. 
And I am not standing here alone be-
cause once I started talking about this 
with my colleagues, I found out how 
many other Members of Congress are 
touched by this or know people who 
have this. 
Again, we found out about sisters, 
comms directors they work with. In 
fact, even just this morning, after I 
started talking about it, there was an-
other Congressman who came up to me 
and said his wife has it. As I talked 
about it more in my personal life, I 
have also met more women who strug-
gle with endometriosis. 
So I am standing here today with 
them and in support of them and their 
pain. And today, at the beginning of 
this Endometriosis Awareness Month, 
we are launching the very first Endo-
metriosis Caucus. 
Through this caucus, this bipartisan 
caucus, we are going to raise awareness 
with the public and in Congress to get 
more funding and the kind of support 
that this disease deserves. We need to 
end the stigma around endometriosis 
and bring more attention to this condi-
tion affecting millions of women, their 
families, and their friends. 
Today, I ask my colleagues in Con-
gress, and everyone watching, to join 
me in this movement, to join this cau-
cus. We have to up endo funding, up 
endo research, and up endo awareness. 
It is too important, and there are too 
many women across the United States 
and worldwide who deal with this every 
day to be ignored for far too long. 
Madam Speaker, thank you for the 
opportunity to speak here today about 
this important issue. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1230 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. STE-
VENS). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) is 
recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the tribute of my colleague 
a few moments ago for law enforce-
ment. 
One of the things that arose out of 
the evil hatred that brought about 9/ 
11’s attacks was people began to appre-
ciate our military again and began to 
appreciate our first responders again. 
That was a very welcome development. 
And it seems that in recent years so 
much of that respect and admiration 
has been clouded by false allegations 
against some law enforcement. So it is 
great to hear other colleagues talk 
about the importance of our law en-
forcement and the role they play. 
Unfortunately, what many consider 
to be the greatest law enforcement 
agency or department in the world has 
been badly clouded by bad actors with-
in the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
I know U.S. Attorney Durham is inves-
tigating. We haven’t seen any results 
come from that at this point. We have 
just seen terribly inappropriate if not 
criminal conduct from FBI agents in 
recent years that resulted in no pun-
ishment. 
We had Christopher Wray, the direc-
tor of the FBI, before our committee 
recently. I questioned him about the 
FBI agent who falsified information to 
submit to the FISA court, in essence, 
changing the information that said 
Carter Page did work for our intel-
ligence agency to saying he did not, 
and instead of the director punishing 
him, he was allowed to resign. That is 
not hardly cleaning up criminal con-
duct. 
The people that swore to applications 
and affidavits before the FISA court in 
order to get warrants to spy upon Car-
ter 
Page—Papadopoulos—the 
Trump 
campaign was obviously the goal. We 
haven’t seen people punished, but the 
reputation of the FBI and those good 
FBI agents who do enforce and follow 
and properly investigate the law, they 
suffered. It is going to take, obviously, 
a different director of the FBI in order 
to clean up the FBI and get their rep-
utation back. 
Simply allowing people to resign or 
retire when from all appearances they 
have engaged in criminal conduct when 
they are supposed to be investigating 
criminals, that is not enough. To deny 
and to turn the other cheek when you 
find out about improprieties within 
your department, that is not enough. 
As Christians, we believe in what 
Jesus taught about turning the other 
cheek or loving your enemy, but there 
is a different role for Christians when 
they are in government, and that does 
not mean ignoring criminal impropri-
eties; it means, like Romans 13 talks 
about, if you do evil, you are supposed 
to be afraid because the government 
was not given the sword in vain. It is 
supposed to punish evildoers. And that 
is one of the roles. 
We are supposed to have good over-
sight in Congress, and the FBI had 
been allowed to devolve into great 
problems here in Washington, and not 
just in Washington, but even working 
for the District of Columbia. The 
agent, possibly agents, that helped 
cover up for the Awan brothers further 
cast great clouds over the reputation of 
the FBI, but here again, that is in 
Washington. 
Across the country, around the world 
we have good FBI agents. But when my 
very dear friend, brother, Philip Haney 
was found with a gunshot wound to his 
chest out in California, I wish I were 
comforted when we got word that FBI 
agents 
were 
being 
sent 
to 
assist 
Amador County in the investigation. I 
don’t know which agents were sent. I 
don’t know if they were good FBI or 
FBI like Strzok and Page and McCabe 
and others who had no problem being 
political and being dishonest in their 
jobs. 
I know Inspector General Horowitz 
has come out with more information 
about another investigation, but the 
manner in which he did a great job of 
finding so many improprieties and then 
came to conclusions completely oppo-
site of what the fact findings were is a 
bit disturbing. 
We need the FBI cleaned up. We need 
the reputation back. But it needs to 
come back not through cover-ups like 
it appears to me has been going on in 
recent years, but from actually clean-
ing out those who have been abusing 
their authority. 
We are supposed to be taking up the 
issue of a couple of provisions. The PA-
TRIOT Act section 215 is coming up, 
fortunately, for sunset. We should be 
taking up the issue of the Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act court, the 
FISA court. But when we address that, 
when it has come up, when we have had 
private discussions with Federal au-
thorities, those of us on the Judiciary 
Committee in the past, going back to 
my first year here, 2005, we have been 
assured, this is FISA, this is the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The 
purpose is to help us go after foreigners 
who are known terrorists or are for-
eigners who have relationships with 
known terrorist organizations. That is 
who we are going after. 
The only time we were assured years 
ago that we may pick up an American 
citizen is if they are in contact with 
known foreign terrorists or known for-
eign terrorist organizations, otherwise, 
we don’t even pick them up. And we 
find out now years later, those were 
lies. The ‘‘F’’ in FISA stands for for-
eign, but what we have come to find 
out through the FBI dishonesty in pur-
suing the Trump campaign was that 
actually they go after American citi-
zens on a regular basis. It is a regular 
thing. They use the FISA court to spy

March 5, 2020 
on Americans, to spy on the Trump 
campaign, but even more than that, to 
constantly be grabbing up Americans’ 
phone records. And there was a time 
when they could say with a straight 
face, look, all we are getting is the 
metadata. We don’t know who these 
phone numbers are. They are just 
metadata that we can run algorithms 
and see if there are any terrorist num-
bers in there. Well, we know that is not 
what has been going on. 
Maybe that has, but what addition-
ally has been going on, and we saw this 
with Chairman SCHIFF, he was able to 
gather information about people in his 
own committee, phone numbers, people 
they had called because the days of 
being able to say, well, it is metadata, 
we don’t know what all those numbers 
are; no, nowadays you can know very 
quickly whose number is where and 
what metadata. And they are spying on 
Americans. 
So I have said before, unless there 
was a dramatic cleanup, and we have 
seen no indication from the FISA 
judges 
themselves 
that 
they 
have 
enough pride in their position that 
they would be offended by fraud upon 
their courts—I don’t have a problem 
with the FISA courts going away. I 
mean, we succeeded in winning World 
War II when we had important national 
secrets, and we went through Korea, 
went through the Cold War, the worst 
of the Cold War years, without having 
FISA courts. They came into being in 
the 1970s. And now over 40 years or so 
later, we find out that the use of the 
FISA court has devolved into abuse of 
the FISA courts so that American citi-
zens are routinely spied upon. And they 
are not foreign. They are American 
citizens. 
I would love to see, and I really ap-
preciated—we 
disagree 
on 
lots 
of 
things, but ZOE LOFGREN from Cali-
fornia, most of us would say she is 
much more liberal, but she has always 
been concerned about American civil 
rights. In talking with her yesterday, I 
am still impressed, she is still con-
cerned about America’s civil rights, 
and we should not have Americans 
spied on. So I know Congresswoman 
LOFGREN has been working on ways to 
try to actually clean up the FISA court 
and make some reforms that would 
help clean things up. 
But I am to the point with so many 
abuses that we have found that we 
could either do away with the FISA 
court and go back to the days—and, I 
mean, as a judge I have handled so 
many warrants, applications, affidavits 
for warrants, signed warrants—you had 
to have probable cause that a crime 
was committed, probable cause that 
this person probably committed the 
crime, and then you had to describe 
with particularity, that is a require-
ment of the Fourth Amendment, you 
have to describe with particularity the 
thing to be searched and the thing to 
be searched for. And it is often the case 
that none of those things are found in 
FISA applications, affidavits, and war-
rants, at least from the things that we 
have seen. 
So the solution in prior days when 
there was no FISA court, you would 
file a motion with the court and ask 
for an in-camera review, ask that docu-
ments be sealed for national security 
purposes. There was normally a time 
limit, from the ones I am aware of, a 
time limit on how long they were 
sealed. And that was to protect na-
tional security, if it involved national 
secrets, national security secrets. But 
at least it would seem, and I certainly 
hope that if we are going to reform the 
Foreign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Courts that we have an amendment 
that says, you know, since the ‘‘F’’ in 
FISA stands for foreign, then the For-
eign 
Intelligence 
Surveillance 
Act 
Courts are not going to be granting 
warrants against American citizens. 
If someone in Federal law enforce-
ment, especially the FBI, wants to spy 
on an American citizen, they can go to 
an Article III Federal District Court to 
get their warrant. You shouldn’t be 
able to go to this secret star chamber 
court to spy on American citizens. 
That was never, ever anticipated as one 
of the jobs of the FISA courts when 
they were created back in the 1970s. If 
we are going clean it up, and the FBI 
has shown no propensity to be able to 
clean it up themselves and to police 
themselves, and the FISA courts them-
selves have not shown that ability or 
propensity, and, in fact, many have 
been advocating since we found out 
about such widespread abuse in the 
FISA courts, some have advocated, 
well, maybe if we just allow or require 
the FISA courts to appoint an amicus, 
a friend of the Court to stand in for the 
interests of the person against whom a 
warrant is being sought, that should be 
an adequate reform. 
Then that was proved to be totally 
bogus back in December when—after 
this FISA judge who had apparently in-
sufficient pride in her court to punish 
people who committed a fraud upon the 
court—an amicus was appointed who 
happened to be the person who had 
been lying for quite some time in say-
ing that DEVIN NUNES was lying when 
it turned out DEVIN was exactly right 
in the things that he put in his report 
and that the amicus that the FISA 
court appointed was the one who had 
been either lying or just completely ig-
norant. That is the lawyer that was ap-
pointed as the friend of the court. 
b 1245 
Clearly, the FISA courts are not ca-
pable of cleaning up their own messes. 
They enjoy, apparently, having fraud 
committed upon them and their courts 
as long as they get to keep signing 
warrants against American citizens 
without the American citizens having 
the right to come in and contest it. 
I would love to see, especially if we 
are going to leave the FISA courts, at 
least let’s have an amendment. And I 
surely hope that this will become a 
very bipartisan effort to say it is a For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act, so 
we are not going to allow a Foreign In-
telligence Surveillance Act court to 
grant warrants against American citi-
zens. If somebody wants those, go to an 
Article III court. 
For those not familiar with the Con-
stitution—I realize that there are more 
and more these days since more schools 
are having to teach to the federally 
mandated test, and there are no civics 
questions I am aware of that are com-
pelled to be asked in the mandated 
Federal test. We don’t have as many 
high school students, graduates from 
high school, who know about Article I, 
II, and III of the Constitution. 
A recent survey, in recent years at 
least, indicated that, as I recall, more 
young people 25 and under can identify 
the Three Stooges than can identify 
the three branches of the Federal Gov-
ernment: executive, legislative, and ju-
dicial. 
So Article III is the article dealing 
with the courts. As my old constitu-
tional law professor, David Guinn, used 
to say, there is only one court created 
in the Constitution, and that is the Su-
preme Court. All other Federal courts 
owe their existence and their jurisdic-
tion to the United States Congress. In 
other words, Congress brought them 
into the world, and Congress can take 
them out of the world. 
So I would hope that if we don’t 
eliminate the FISA court because of 
such broad abuses that would allow, 
encourage, and not respond to abuses 
when one administration is seeking to 
spy on and participate in a coup 
against another party’s candidate, then 
it is time to eliminate the court, and if 
not eliminate the court, at least elimi-
nate the ability of the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Court to grant 
warrants against American citizens. 
American citizens are supposed to be 
able to have those civil rights, and 
they have been taken away by the cre-
ation and abuse of the FISA courts. It 
is time that this Congress, in a bipar-
tisan method, came together and said 
enough of the abuses. 
Let’s face it: President Trump has 
been getting Federal judges appointed 
and confirmed in record numbers. I 
think, from what I can tell, Attorney 
General Barr is doing what he can to 
clean up the Justice Department, and I 
am sure he would defend Christopher 
Wray. I just happen to disagree with 
the job that the Director of the FBI 
currently is doing. 
But there are going to be some people 
who are interested in justice who re-
place those who have been extremely 
partisan, as we have seen. 
I would encourage my friends across 
the aisle who have seen how helpful the 
FBI was to a Democratic administra-
tion politically just to keep in mind 
there are changes being made, and it is 
not going to be so helpful to one party 
over another in the future. 
I would hope that colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle would come together 
to say: You know what? This really is

the time. We have to stand up for 
American rights. 
It is one thing under the Constitu-
tion to have writs of habeas corpus sus-
pended in a time of war, but it is quite 
another to prevent writs of habeas cor-
pus, because American citizens don’t 
even know that they are being spied 
upon by their own government and 
cases are being made against them 
through spying by their own govern-
ment without probable cause, without 
proper warrants. 
It is time to fix that, and I hope this 
will be the Congress that does so. 
So, we have this article from The 
Washington Times, Jeff Mordock, yes-
terday. It says: ‘‘FBI missed chances to 
stop domestic terror attacks because of 
lack of follow-up,’’ according to the 
Horowitz report, apparently. 
In this article, it points out that the 
IG investigation revealed ‘‘lapses in 
the Bureau’s assessments allowed per-
petrators of some of the most deadly 
attacks 
in 
recent 
history 
to 
fall 
through the cracks.’’ 
That is understandable since the FBI 
was trying to help prevent Donald 
Trump from being elected President 
and then trying to participate in what 
certainly appeared to be an attempted 
coup, that, gee, they were just too busy 
to actually prevent some of these ter-
rorist attacks, according to the article 
and the IG report: ‘‘Omar Mateen, who 
killed 49 people at the Pulse nightclub 
in Orlando, Florida, in 2016; Tamerlan 
Tsarnaev, who killed three people at 
the Boston Marathon in 2013; Nidal 
Hasan, who massacred 13 people at 
Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009; Esteban 
Santiago, who killed five people in a 
2017 attack at the Fort Lauderdale-Hol-
lywood International Airport.’’ 
‘‘ ‘The FBI has acknowledged that 
various weaknesses related to its as-
sessment process may have impacted 
its ability to fully investigate certain 
counterterrorism assessment subjects, 
who later committed terrorist acts in 
the United States,’ ’’ Mr. Horowitz 
wrote. 
The article says: ‘‘The inspector gen-
eral’s report is the latest black eye for 
the Bureau,’’ that is the FBI, of course, 
‘‘which has been besieged by allega-
tions of political taint and questions of 
competence. 
‘‘ ‘Anytime there is criticism, of 
course, it undermines the public faith 
in the Bureau, and that can never be 
good because the FBI depends on the 
public trust,’ said Lewis Schiliro, a 
former head of the FBI’s New York 
field office.’’ 
But further down, it says: ‘‘Even 
after the FBI discovered lapses in its 
assessment 
of 
potential 
terrorist 
threats, field office managers failed to 
properly implement changes or con-
duct consistent oversight of counter-
terrorism investigations, the report 
said. 
‘‘Roughly 40 percent of the FBI’s 
counterterrorism 
assessments 
went 
unaddressed for 18 months, even after 
Bureau officials discovered investiga-
tive lapses, Mr. Horowitz wrote.’’ 
‘‘The FBI first investigated Mateen 
in 2013, 3 years before he carried out 
the deadly Pulse shooting. Agents 
closed the case months later and did 
not properly address Mateen’s history 
of mental illness, the report said. 
‘‘Agents investigated Tsarnaev ahead 
of the Boston Marathon bombing. Even 
after an internal Bureau database 
flagged Tsarnaev, agents closed the 
probe after concluding he had ‘no nexus 
to terrorism.’’’ 
That was interesting, the Tsarnaev 
investigation. I had the opportunity to 
question 
an 
FBI 
Director 
named 
Mueller about that because Tsarnaev 
was identified by the Russians. He had 
been over in an area where some Mus-
lims had been radicalized, making 
them, as radicals, a threat to non- 
radicalized Muslims, both Christians, 
non-radicalized Muslims, Jews, others 
who were not radicalized Muslims. 
In fact, Russia had notified the FBI. 
To the FBI’s credit, apparently, from 
what we found, they did send an agent 
out to question Tamerlan Tsarnaev. It 
sounded like basically they asked him 
if he was a terrorist, and he assured 
them he wasn’t. They went above and 
beyond and questioned his mother, and 
she assured them that Tamerlan was a 
good boy, that he wasn’t a terrorist. 
As I put to Director Mueller: You 
didn’t even go out to the mosque where 
they were attending and find out infor-
mation 
that 
would 
have 
revealed 
whether they had been radicalized or 
not. 
About all Mueller could come back 
with was that they did go out to that 
mosque, not to investigate Tsarnaev, 
but to actually just have part of their 
community outreach program. 
And I said: You probably didn’t even 
know who founded that mosque. 
And he didn’t. He didn’t know, but it 
was founded by a man who was doing 23 
years in Federal prison for supporting 
terrorism. 
But before Mueller came in and 
purged the FBI of training materials 
that would allow FBI agents to iden-
tify who were the peace-loving Mus-
lims and the small group that had been 
radicalized that wanted to kill non- 
radicalized Muslims, he purged them, 
as I have said before. One of our agents 
said: He blinded us of our ability to see 
who was a threat. 
Thank 
you 
very 
much, 
Director 
Mueller. 
He purged the training materials. 
There was an advanced course for 
FBI—I think 700 pages of training—and 
Mueller ordered all of that eliminated. 
Fortunately, after he left—and after 
we had more attacks and more Ameri-
cans died—eventually, the training was 
brought back for some FBI agents. But 
it still needs work. 
But these FBI agents, they didn’t 
know what to look for because Mueller 
had eliminated the training materials 
that would have helped them know 
what to look for in radicalized attacks. 
Of course, my friend, Philip Haney, 
who was found dead with a bullet hole 
in his chest, he was investigating a 
group called Tablighi Jamaat. It is in-
teresting that some of the training 
Tablighi Jamaat did, including for the 
killers in San Diego, there was certain 
training that they undergo that I am 
not going to get into, but if someone is 
undergoing that training, it should 
send up red flags, certain parts of that 
training, at least, that this person may 
be on the road to radicalization. 
It is just very unfortunate that our 
most powerful investigating body had 
been so purged of people who could rec-
ognize radicalization that it put Amer-
icans at risk, and Americans died as a 
result 
of 
that 
effort 
by 
Director 
Mueller and others within the FBI. 
This article goes on and points out 
that: ‘‘The inspector general said the 
Bureau bungled the case of Elton Simp-
son, who tried to ambush a Garland, 
Texas, art exhibit featuring cartoon 
images of the prophet Muhammad, the 
central 
figure 
of 
Islam. 
Although 
agents received information related to 
Simpson, they determined he was not a 
significant threat. 
‘‘Mr. Horowitz said that even after 
the FBI sought to address the problem, 
it failed to conduct the necessary over-
sight to implement the recommended 
changes.’’ 
I would humbly submit that when 
Comey took over from Mueller, he did 
not improve matters at the FBI when 
it came to identifying threats against 
American citizens. 
b 1300 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to address 
the issue of the coronavirus. 
We have heard allegations that our 
President is just totally out of it, to-
tally uninformed, and totally unpre-
pared to deal with the coronavirus. 
Sometimes the best way to analyze 
whether or not a leader is, not out of 
it, but actually has taken bold steps to 
protect Americans is helped along by 
comparing to a prior administration, 
for example. 
There is an article by ABC News, Dr. 
Angela 
Baldwin: 
‘‘How 
Novel 
Coronavirus Compares to SARS, MERS 
and Other Recent Viral Outbreaks.’’ 
Dr. Baldwin points out that: ‘‘MERS, 
Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, 
was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 
2012. Of the 27 countries affected glob-
ally, 10 countries are in or near the 
Arabian Peninsula and 17 countries are 
outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Only 
two patients in the U.S. ever tested 
positive for MERS. 
‘‘To date, there have been nearly 
2,500 
laboratory-confirmed 
cases 
of 
MERS, with a death rate of about 34 
percent. 
‘‘Influenza is another contagious res-
piratory illness with symptoms that 
are similar to SARS, MERS, and 
COVID–19. It is caused by the influenza 
A and influenza B viruses. Different 
strains of influenza are responsible for 
the flu season that occurs every year. 
The CDC estimates that there have 
been 18,000 to 46,000 flu deaths so far 
this season.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1528 
March 5, 2020 
‘‘The swine flu, or influenza A,’’ 
which was the H1N1 virus, ‘‘caused the 
2009 global pandemic. An estimated 
151,000 to 575,000 people, worldwide, 
died from the H1N1 virus in 2009. Of 
those, there were an estimated 12,400 
deaths in the U.S. . . . This strain con-
tinues to circulate as a seasonal flu 
virus each year . . . . ’’ 
But 12,400 American deaths from the 
H1N1 virus? I was shocked to read that. 
I didn’t remember reading or hearing 
that, during the Obama administra-
tion, there was such a weak response to 
the H1N1 virus that we had 12,400 
Americans die from the H1N1 virus. 
So it is interesting. President Trump 
reacted immediately to the informa-
tion of a virus of the nature of the 
coronavirus, or COVID–19, coming from 
China. He reacted by restricting travel 
from those areas. 
And thank goodness he reacted so 
quickly, even though he was con-
demned by some Democrats for being 
racist and for being a xenophobe. All he 
was trying to do was protect Ameri-
cans from this virus. 
So he suffers the indignities, the 
slings and arrows, being called a racist 
and a xenophobe, but he didn’t care be-
cause he was protecting the American 
people. Had he not reacted so quickly, 
there is no doubt we would have had 
many more Americans infected with 
the virus. 
He also reacted with regard to our 
southern border that has been so po-
rous, despite his best efforts. We, no 
doubt, have been saved from many 
more cases of COVID–19 arising here in 
the United States by the efforts of our 
Border Patrol and the Trump adminis-
tration. 
This article points out: ‘‘In compari-
son,’’ talking about in comparison to 
the H1N1 virus, ‘‘COVID–19 has spread 
to more than 50 countries and infected 
more than 85,000 people, worldwide, 
since January of this year. In the 
United States, there have been about 70 
cases . . . . ’’ 
I think there may be more than 100 
now, but this article, dated March 2, 
says, ‘‘two people have died.’’ But I be-
lieve there are more than that, maybe 
as many as 10 who have died here in 
the United States. 
I wish that we were getting a report 
out that these are normally our senior 
citizens who have some preexisting 
health condition. So we should be en-
couraging senior citizens and retire-
ment homes, they all should be very 
careful, because it seems that our sen-
iors are most at risk here and around 
the world. 
‘‘While COVID–19 seems to spread 
easily, the symptoms tend to be mild, 
particularly for people who are rel-
atively young and healthy. The SARS 
and MERS outbreaks had significantly 
higher death rates. Meanwhile, sea-
sonal influenza remains an important 
cause of respiratory illness that can 
cause hospitalization and death . . . . 
‘‘As Dr. Robert Glatter, emergency 
physician at New York City’s Lenox 
Hill Hospital noted: ‘Make sure you get 
a flu shot. It’s much more likely to 
contract 
the 
flu 
than 
the 
new 
coronavirus infection.’ 
‘‘He also warns: ‘Older persons should 
also make sure they get vaccinated 
against pneumonia and shingles, since 
these are more likely if they develop a 
viral 
infection 
such 
as 
the 
coronavirus.’’’ 
But every one of those Americans 
who has died, 10 or so—I am sure the 
number will grow—it is a tragedy. It is 
devastating to the loved ones, and I am 
just surprised we didn’t hear a whole 
lot about the 12,400 Americans during 
the Obama administration who died 
from the H1N1 virus. 
So, obviously, the media gets much 
more up in arms over 10 Americans 
dying from the coronavirus than they 
did over the 12,400 that may have died 
in 1 year in America from the H1N1 
virus. 
I was concerned earlier here, an hour 
or so ago, to hear Majority Leader 
HOYER saying, as I understood him to 
say, next week, the majority here 
wants to prevent President Trump’s 
travel bans. 
We are finding out that, because of 
President Trump’s travel bans, lives 
have been saved. The coronavirus has 
not spread, as it surely would have, and 
so the answer next week will be to re-
strict President Trump’s abilities to 
save American lives by preventing peo-
ple from coming into this country from 
areas where the coronavirus is found to 
be widespread, people coming in with-
out adequate ability to make sure they 
are not infected. I was very sorry to 
hear that that is something that we, 
apparently, are going to take up next 
week. 
There is an article here from PJ 
Media, by Victoria Taft, February 28, 
2020, and the headline says: ‘‘Fact- 
Check: Obama Waited Until ‘Millions’ 
Were Infected and 1,000 Dead in U.S. 
Before Declaring H1N1 Emergency.’’ 
That is the virus we were just talk-
ing about. Anyway, that is a rather in-
teresting article pointing out the dif-
ference between President Obama’s re-
sponse to the H1N1 and the thousands 
that died as a result of—actually, the 
other article talked about the 12,400. 
There is an article here from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control, June 25 of 
2012: ‘‘First Global Estimates of 2009 
H1N1 Pandemic Mortality Released by 
CDC-Led Collaboration.’’ 
But it points out the ‘‘improved mod-
eling approach which resulted in an es-
timated range of deaths from between 
151,700 and 575,400 people who perished 
worldwide from 2009 H1N1 virus infec-
tion during the first year the virus cir-
culated. . . . ’’ 
I don’t really have information on 
how many Americans died. Apparently, 
that 12,400 was just in the first year, so 
no telling how many died during the 8 
years of the Obama administration. 
So we have got more work to do, but 
I don’t think it is helpful to blame 
President Trump for trying to protect 
American citizens from being exposed 
more and more to the coronavirus, or 
COVID–19. 
On another note, we have heard 
about the Afghanistan peace agree-
ment. My concerns have been hearing, 
during the Bush administration, that 
they took a great deal of advice from 
former Ambassador Khalilzad, and it 
sure sounds like he made a mess of the 
Bush foreign policy with regard to Af-
ghanistan when discussions were being 
held—what kind of government should 
we give Afghanistan—and that troubles 
me. 
We shouldn’t be asking that ques-
tion. That should have been a question 
for the Afghans. And though Khalilzad 
may have been an Afghan, he is an 
American; and he was listened to, as I 
understand, during the Obama adminis-
tration, which explains some of their 
problems with getting out, as Presi-
dent Obama wanted to do. He said he 
was going to. He was sure trying, but 
problems kept arising. 
I would think if somebody gives ad-
vice that didn’t help the Bush adminis-
tration and didn’t help the Obama ad-
ministration, then I deeply regret that 
anybody in the current administration 
would be taking advice from that same 
individual. 
The Taliban were our enemies. They 
have never indicated that they want to 
stop killing Americans. As our allies 
who fought and successfully defeated 
the Taliban within 6 months of 9/11, by 
the end of February 2002, after the 
Taliban had been identified as our 
enemy, helping al-Qaida with the at-
tacks on the United States on 9/11, we— 
well, I say ‘‘we,’’ but, actually, it was 
our allies who defeated the Taliban. By 
the end of February, there was no real 
organized Taliban in Afghanistan. The 
groups had been devastated. 
We provided aerial support. We had 
about 300 special ops people in there 
embedded 
with 
General 
Dostum’s 
Northern Alliance groups, different 
tribal groups that we supported, and 
they outed the Taliban. Some fled to 
Pakistan, but there was no organized 
Taliban left. 
And then the mistake occurred: What 
kind of government should we give 
them, and let’s occupy Afghanistan for 
a while. Occupiers have never done well 
in Afghanistan, and that still remains 
true. 
But the biggest problem I have was 
the advice. I could be corrected, but I 
am told by people who were around 
back in the second Bush term that 
Khalilzad was one of those saying: We 
need to give them a strong central gov-
ernment. You don’t want to have a fed-
eralist government like we have in 
America where States have so much 
power, States and local government. 
Let’s just have a strong President. 
And we gave them a constitution 
that we basically forced on them that 
made the President all powerful, near-
ly.

mayors, and he appoints the police 
chiefs. What I hear from some of our 
Afghan friends is he will often, whether 
it was Karzai—Ghani is not as bad as 
Karzai was, Ghani seems to be trying 
to 
do 
better—but 
sometimes 
they 
would appoint people who didn’t even 
live in the province or the city to come 
in and rule over it. 
What our allies, who fought with us 
and for us in initially defeating the 
Taliban, had begged for is for our help 
to get Afghanistan to amend their con-
stitution so they get to elect their gov-
ernors, they would get to elect their 
mayors, and they would get to select 
their own police chiefs because the 
constitution that we gave them is a 
formula for corruption. 
Who pays off the president to become 
the governor or the mayor? 
That is a formula for corruption. It is 
easy to see when we gave them that 
constitution that is where it was head-
ed. 
As some of our former allies, the 
former Northern Alliance, have told 
me: 
Look, if we could elect our own governors, 
elect our own mayors like you do in Amer-
ica, and pick our own police chiefs, then, yes, 
we know—they have been saying this for 
years—we know you are going to have to pull 
out at some time. We understand. That is 
fine. You don’t want to be an occupier, and 
we don’t want you to be. But if you leave the 
president as all powerful and he picks the 
governors, mayors, and police chiefs, then all 
the Taliban have got to do when you leave is 
either knock him off or corrupt him, and 
then they will control the whole country, 
and there is nothing we can do about it. 
In fact, all of us who fought with you 
Americans and helped defeat the Taliban— 
actually they defeated the Taliban ini-
tially—they are all going to be dead. We are 
going to all be dead, so that when the 
Taliban gets strong enough again, they at-
tack you again and you come to Afghanistan 
looking for allies, we are going to all be 
dead, and nobody is going to want to be your 
ally because you allowed us all to die when 
you allowed the Taliban to take back over. 
So, I would hope something that we 
will work toward is helping the Af-
ghans. 
I said: Well, what makes you think 
we could help you amend your own 
constitution? 
I was told: Well, you guys pay most 
of our budget. If you say you are not 
going to pay the budget anymore, then 
we will amend our constitution. If you 
force us to do that, we will amend our 
constitution, and we will get to elect 
our governors like you do, elect our 
mayors like you do, and pick our own 
police chiefs like you do; and we won’t 
have people brought in through corrup-
tion or favoritism, and we will be capa-
ble. 
As Massoud said: 
Look, when you leave, if we get to elect 
our own governors and mayors and pick our 
own police chiefs, yeah, the Taliban may be 
able to take over one or two provinces, but 
the rest of us will band together again, as we 
did in 2001 and 2002, and we will kick them 
out again. But if you leave us where the 
Taliban can take over complete control and 
where all the control is in the president of 
Afghanistan, we are all going to be killed, 
and you won’t have any allies to fight with 
you and for you when the Taliban hits you 
again. 
So, I hope we will quit taking advice 
from a person, no matter how well- 
meaning or not, who just proved to be 
totally wrong in administration after 
administration. I think that we can do 
as the President truly wants to do, get 
out of Afghanistan and save American 
lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to address one 
other thing, and that is the comments 
of the minority leader of the Senate 
made at the Supreme Court rally. 
There is an article here from FOX 
News, Edmund DeMarche, which says: 
‘‘The American Bar Association said 
on Wednesday that it is ‘deeply trou-
bled’ by a comment made by Senate 
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Dem-
ocrat, New York, outside the Supreme 
Court that many said was a direct 
threat to two sitting Justices. 
‘‘Schumer was at a rally over a high- 
profile abortion case while the case 
played out inside. Schumer named As-
sociate Justices Neil Gorsuch and 
Brett Kavanaugh and, in an impas-
sioned speech, said: ‘You have released 
the whirlwind, and you will pay the 
price. You will not know what hit you 
if you go forward with these awful deci-
sions.’ 
‘‘Justin Goodman, a Schumer spokes-
man, responded after Chief Justice 
John Roberts issued a statement on 
what he called ‘threatening’ comments. 
Goodman said that Schumer was ad-
dressing Republican lawmakers when 
he said a ‘price’ would be paid.’’ 
Now, I think it is very important to 
note the difference between a threat 
and total agreement with Supreme 
Court Justices. President Trump has 
disagreed with things the Supreme 
Court has done or comments that have 
been made. That is the American way. 
We can disagree whenever we want to. 
People in this body, including me, have 
been very disagreeable with some of 
the things the Supreme Court has 
done, and it is very helpful to voice 
that. 
As Natan Sharansky points out in his 
book, ‘‘The Case for Democracy’’, he 
says, there are basically two societies, 
a fear society and a free society. In a 
free society he suggests an appropriate 
test is if you can go into the town 
square and say anything you want to 
as long as it is not a criminal state-
ment, but otherwise you say whatever 
you want to, and if you don’t have to 
worry about arrest or being harmed, 
that is a free society. 
A fear society is one where you have 
to constantly be afraid because the 
government may decide to swoop you 
up or people may come beat you up for 
saying what you say. 
For many years this country has 
been a free country, but even in a free 
country where you can say whatever 
you want, it crosses the line when you 
threaten individuals who are in govern-
ment. 
I understand this Goodman speaking 
for Minority Leader SCHUMER as say-
ing, no, no, he was talking about Re-
publican lawmakers. But if you look 
back at the quote, there is no mistake 
about what Senator SCHUMER said. He 
said: ‘‘You have released the whirl-
wind, and you will pay the price.’’ 
This is after he has called out 
Kavanaugh and Gorsuch, ‘‘and you will 
pay the price,’’ and if there is any ques-
tion at all about whom the threat was 
intended to go to, he said: ‘‘You will 
not know what hit you if you go for-
ward with these awful decisions.’’ 
Now, these are not awful decisions he 
is threatening over by Republican law-
makers because the Republican law-
makers have nothing to do with the 
Supreme Court decisions. And he says 
‘‘decisions.’’ 
This was a threat to two of our Su-
preme Court Justices, and that crosses 
the line from disagreement—as all of 
us probably in this body have done 
from time to time and should because 
the Supreme Court is not perfect. They 
make mistakes. Dred Scott was, I 
think, probably the worst mistake the 
Supreme Court has ever made, but they 
have certainly made many more since 
then, not to that level. 
It is fine in America to disagree with 
the Supreme Court. It is fine for Sen-
ator SCHUMER to do that, but not when 
he threatens and says: ‘‘You will not 
know what hit you—’’ of course, the 
term ‘‘hit’’ is an assaultive reference— 
‘‘you will not know what hit you if you 
go forward with these awful decisions.’’ 
Now, he could be speaking of this 
assaultive term figuratively, but re-
gardless of whether it is figurative or 
literal, it is a threat upon two of our 
Supreme Court Justices. 
Then, unfortunately, Senator SCHU-
MER has doubled down by his coming 
after Chief Justice John Roberts. I 
have certainly disagreed with him 
plenty of times, but he did the appro-
priate thing here in defending two of 
his Justices who were attacked or 
threatened. He doesn’t need to defend 
them when they are verbally attacked 
as so often happens in the Senate or 
the House, but certainly when they are 
threatened he needed to step up and he 
did so. 
For those who wonder, 18 U.S.C. sec-
tion 115 of the U.S. Code says: That 
whoever threatens to assault, kidnap, 
or murder a U.S. official, a U.S. judge, 
a Federal law enforcement officer or an 
official whose killing would be a crime 
under such section—then it goes on and 
says—that person has committed a 
crime can be arrested. 
So it is a crime just to threaten. I am 
not sure the term ‘‘hit’’ would be ade-
quate to prove beyond a reasonable 
doubt that an assault was threatened, 
but something was threatened because 
they would not know what hit them, 
and that goes beyond the pale. As I un-
derstand it, people have been disbarred 
for making threats of that nature. 
But we will see what happens. I cer-
tainly hope that there will be an apol-
ogy by Senator SCHUMER because we

ought to disagree with the Supreme

This should be the last bastion of ci-
vility where we can come, we can dis-
agree, we can fuss at each other, we

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
VENEZUELA—MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116–105) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, with re-
spect to the situation in Venezuela is 
to continue in effect beyond March 8, 
2020. 
The situation in Venezuela continues 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-

DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, March 5, 2020. 
f 
A THREAT TO TWO OF OUR 
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Iowa (Mr. KING) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate the privilege to be recognized 
to address you here on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. 
Having listened to the gentleman 
ahead of me, Mr. LOUIE GOHMERT and 
some of the discussion that he had, I 
would pick up with the beginning here, 
Mr. Speaker, with one of the places 
where he left off, and that is what hap-
pened before the United States Su-
preme Court yesterday and the state-
ments that were made by the minority 
leader of the United States Senate. 
I may have a bit of a different per-
spective than some in this House or 
Senate or across this land, but here is 
the language that was deemed offensive 
from Senator SCHUMER. I watched the 
video, and he was pointing. He pointed 
at the United States Supreme Court, 
and he used the names of two Supreme 
Court Justices. He said this: ‘‘I want to 
tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, 
Kavanaugh, you have released the 
whirlwind, and you will pay the price. 
You won’t know what hit you if you go 
forward with these awful decisions.’’ 
b 1330 
That was stunning. It was stunning 
to hear two Justices called out in that 
fashion before the Supreme Court. And 
I know that there was a crowd over 
there that was happy to hear those 
words. But as a constitutionalist and 
former chairman of the Constitution 
Subcommittee in the House of Rep-
resentatives, I am troubled by the ef-
fort to try to sway judges through 
what appears to be verbal intimidation 
before the Supreme Court. 
I have stood on those same steps and 
delivered any number of speeches, but I 
always confine them to the constitu-
tional principles that were involved. I 
wanted the Justices to hear my speech. 
I didn’t want them to ever hear it as a 
threat. I wanted them to hear it as a 
rational approach in a way as if I were 
actually arguing before that Supreme 
Court, before that Bench. 
They are all well-learned and very, 
very capable people who are deeply 
steeped in our Constitution and in case 
law. They have their different philoso-
phies, and that is clear. We often see a 
5–4 decision on the Court. 
Mr. Speaker, I thought when I first 
arrived in this town a number of years 
ago, I looked forward to going over to 
the Supreme Court to hear what I ex-
pected to be the profound constitu-
tional arguments before that Bench. So 
I began going over there for some of 
the important cases, with that expecta-
tion. I recall sitting there, listening to 
an argument before the Court, and I 
understood—actually, this would be 
the Kelo decision before the Supreme 
Court. The Kelo decision is the decision 
that I believe amended the Constitu-
tion by the Supreme Court decision. 
It was this. Let’s see, New London, 
Connecticut. There was property there 
that was owned and utilized by owners 
who didn’t want to sell that property 
to the developers. The local govern-
ment wanted that property in the 
hands of the developers because they 
would develop that property into, I be-
lieve, a shopping mall, and then the 
taxes would be the revenue going into 
local governments. So local govern-
ments had an incentive in encouraging 
the development of the property, but 
the property owners sat there with a 
constitutional guarantee in the Fifth 
Amendment of the Constitution that 
says: ‘‘nor shall private property be 
taken for public use, without just com-
pensation.’’ 
That was the guarantee that, first of 
all, only governments could confiscate 
property. They needed to maintain 
that within their own possession, and 
it has to be for a public use. It can’t be 
for a private use. It was a private busi-
ness that they handed that property 
over to in New London, Connecticut. 
Mr. Speaker, when I listened to the 
argument, I expected the argument 
would go back to the very language of 
the Fifth Amendment, and that would 
be argued, perhaps, certainly, on both 
sides. And I come down on the side of: 
The Constitution means what it says, 
and it means what it was understood to 
mean at the time of ratification by the 
people who voted to ratify it. 
We can’t go back and assign different 
definitions to words or simply say that 
it is a living, breathing Constitution 
that can adapt itself to changing 
times. If that were the case, there 
wouldn’t be a provision to amend this 
Constitution provided by our Founding 
Fathers. 
The 
Constitution 
is 
an 
intergenerational, 
contractual 
guar-
antee between one generation of Amer-
icans to the next generation of Ameri-
cans. 
So, I hoped to hear those—in fact, ex-
pected to hear—those arguments before 
the United States Supreme Court. 
What I heard instead were arguments 
that were made to Justice O’Connor, 
and I think they considered her to be 
the swing vote. And she came down on, 
I believe, the constitutional side of it 
in the end. But there were just little 
tweaks that had to do with her back-
ground. 
She was raised on a ranch. I think it 
is a B&B ranch down in southern Ari-
zona, and I think it goes across into 
New Mexico, as I recall. I read her 
books years ago. And some of the ranch 
land that she grew up on was part of 
the Gadsden Purchase that came in 
right at the end of the U.S. and Mexi-
can war. 
But growing up on a ranch, property 
values matter, and property rights 
matter, and water rights matter in 
that part of the country. And her book 
is replete with those kinds of nar-
ratives. It is a really interesting way 
to get some insight into Justice O’Con-
nor. But she understood this case in a 
way I didn’t know until later. 
But I came down here to the floor, 
and we brought a resolution in the 
House of Representatives, a resolution 
of disapproval to what was called the 
Kelo decision. In that Kelo decision, it 
upheld the decision of local govern-
ment in New London, Connecticut, to 
confiscate private property, houses and 
residences that had a deed, and to take 
that land and compensate them for 
what they deemed the value was—con-
demnation—and hand them over to the 
private investors so they can take that

land, develop it, and make money with 
it. That is completely contrary to the 
reason that we have that guarantee 
within our Fifth Amendment. 
As I listened to those oral arguments 
and saw how they were focused on Jus-
tice O’Connor, I understood what was 
going on. And that is, they weren’t pro-
found constitutional arguments; they 
were personalized arguments that were 
designed to get to the psyche of the 
swing Justice who was there. Of course, 
it wasn’t Justice O’Connor, as it turned 
out. 
By the way, I have been critical of 
some of her decisions—not on this one. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to put this nar-
rative in the RECORD because I think 
she is worthy of some significantly 
positive comments. And one of the de-
cisions that she had made—a different 
one, obviously, I was railing away on 
my disagreement with the rationale 
that Justice O’Connor had come down 
with. And so someone in the room said: 
You shouldn’t criticize her until you 
walk a mile in her shoes. 
And I said: I would be happy to walk 
a mile in her shoes. I will walk a thou-
sand miles in her shoes. Appoint me to 
the Supreme Court, and I will walk 
with her. And I bet you I can convince 
her. 
I made some remark like that. And 
then, as I was talking, I said: You know 
what? If I can’t do that, why don’t I 
just invite her to dinner? 
So I followed through. I gave my 
word I would do that, and I went back 
to my desk in my office and sat down 
and wrote a letter to Justice O’Connor 
that invited her to a dinner, just to sit 
down, have a conversation, get to know 
each other, be civil with each other, 
and listen to each other’s philosophical 
discussion. 
I sent the letter over there, not ex-
pecting to get an affirmative response. 
But what I did get was an invitation to 
come to her chambers and do a lunch 
there. I don’t remember the year, but I 
know the date was March 18 of what-
ever year it was, in the earlier part of 
the previous decade. 
So, I went over at that time, and she 
had a lunch all prepared. She had 
baked a pie that was, I presume, for me 
because it was fresh. It was cut and 
served right there in her chambers. 
And we had a delightful discussion. 
She took me from each of the por-
traits of the Chief Justices and walked 
me through the history of the Courts, 
from the beginning all the way up to 
what was current at the time. 
When I left that gracious dinner with 
Justice O’Connor, I decided she has a 
good judgment on her; she has a good 
set of character; she has a compas-
sionate heart, a deep understanding of 
history and law. And disagreeing with 
her, that is all it is, just disagreeing 
with the rationale. 
But I am forever grateful that I took 
the trouble, and I am really grateful 
that she accepted the request that I 
made and then invited me over there to 
dinner. 
So, I wanted to put that in, that our 
Justices are human. And when they get 
threatened, those threats sometimes 
cut deep, and the family feels that. 
These threats that were delivered 
yesterday in front of the United States 
Supreme Court were threats that, 
might I say, intimidate judges. The ju-
dicial branch of government, the Amer-
ican Bar Association, everybody in-
volved in that feels that. And they 
pride themselves in their independence. 
But I better conclude the Kelo deci-
sion before I get too far from it. In any 
case, the Kelo decision came down, and 
they allowed for the confiscation of 
private property handed over to other 
private interests in order to generate 
tax revenue for local government. 
That case still stands. But I was furi-
ous that they would do such damage to 
the Constitution in a 5–4 decision. By 
the way, Justice Scalia has said that 
he believes that case will be overturned 
one day. 
But we brought a resolution of dis-
approval to the floor. It is the only 
time that I know we have done that 
and spoken out in that fashion on a Su-
preme Court decision. I noticed that at 
that time the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, Barney Frank, came down to 
give his speech. I was queued up next. 
Mr. Speaker, I sat right here with my 
notepad ready to take notes because I 
expected to get up and rebut most ev-
erything that I heard Mr. Frank say. 
We found ourselves in disagreement on 
issue after issue, so it was my full ex-
pectation that when he was finished 
talking, I would have a page full of 
things to stand up and rebut. That has 
been my style, and we had had many 
debates like that. 
But as I listened to Mr. Frank that 
day, I realized he had exactly the same 
opinion that I had. He expressed it a 
little bit differently, but he came down 
in support of the resolution of dis-
approval and in support of the Con-
stitution and in support of the prop-
erty rights that are there in the Fifth 
Amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, when I stepped up here 
to this particular podium, my speech 
really was to reject the decision made 
by the Supreme Court. And when I 
spoke that in the RECORD, I said effec-
tively what they have done is they 
have pulled the words out of the Fifth 
Amendment ‘‘for public use.’’ 
‘‘Nor shall private property be taken 
for public use, without just compensa-
tion,’’ and the effect of it was to pull 
the ‘‘for public use’’ out of there. Now, 
the effect of the Fifth Amendment 
after the Kelo decision just says ‘‘nor 
shall private property be taken, with-
out just compensation,’’ which means 
the government can’t come in and take 
your property away from you, unless 
they write you a check, but they can 
give it to anybody they want to in the 
private sector. 
Whatever their motive might be, it 
was approved by the Supreme Court 
with the Kelo decision. And I think 
that will be abused at some point and 
a more reasonable Court may be seated 
at that time and restore the Constitu-
tion on the Kelo decision. 
But my real point here is that we 
can’t be seeking to intimidate the 
Court. They are human. Justice O’Con-
nor—a gracious heart and a nice lady. 
And we used to have receptions over 
there with the Committee on the Judi-
ciary and members of the bench just to 
take some of the temperature down be-
tween the natural disagreements that 
exist between the legislative branch 
and the judicial branch of government. 
Mr. Speaker, when you have the mi-
nority leader, the most powerful, high-
est ranking Democrat in the United 
States Senate, go stand before the Su-
preme Court, point his finger at that 
building that was behind him and say, 
‘‘I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to 
tell you, Kavanaugh: You have released 
the whirlwind, and you will pay the 
price. You won’t know what hit you if 
you go forward with these awful deci-
sions.’’ 
Going forward with an awful decision 
means CHUCK SCHUMER has already de-
cided what he thinks the Court deci-
sion is going to be on the requirements 
that are part of the, I will say, the 
abortion laws that are coming out of 
Louisiana. And I have been one of the 
lead voices on pro-life issues here in 
this United States House of Represent-
atives. 
There is on my lapel a heart that rep-
resents the heartbeat bill. It is a bill 
that I introduced in the previous Con-
gress, and that bill protects unborn ba-
bies. It essentially says this: If a heart-
beat can be detected, the baby is pro-
tected. 
And we know that the heartbeat is 
the first, certain sign of life. When that 
heart starts to beat, you know that 
there is a live baby there. You can’t 
call it anything else. It is a live baby. 
And this little baby has all the com-
ponents of a growing human being. It 
just needs to develop them out to full 
size and to full term. 
And anybody who has picked up and 
held—especially a loved one—a new-
born baby and gazed with awe at the 
miracle in their hands has to know 
that that baby’s life didn’t begin at the 
moment of birth or at the moment of 
first breath and that that baby’s life 
began well before a minute before the 
baby was born. 
Mr. Speaker, I know when I held my 
firstborn son, I looked at him in awe. 
There was an aura about him. The mir-
acle was in my hands. And I thought: 
How can anybody take his life now? He 
is a few minutes old. How can anybody 
take his life now? How could they take 
his life a minute before he was born, or 
an hour before, or a day, or a week, or 
a month before he was born? Or a tri-
mester or three trimesters before he 
was born? At what moment did his life 
begin? Because human life is sacred in 
all its forms. 
b 1345 
And we only have to choose when did 
life begin. It is not that hard a ques-
tion. Because it is a continuum; it is a

gradual growing continuum from the 
moment of conception on. 
But that heartbeat says this is a live 
baby here. And when that heart stops, 
we call that death. When the heart 
starts, we know that is life. Even 
though life began at the moment of 
conception, medically, we can’t pin-
point that precisely enough, but I am 
willing to go there if we can get there. 
Right now, we are at heartbeat. And 
in the last Congress, I was able to get 
174 cosponsors, and those 174 cospon-
sors all signed on with an expectation 
that we would protect all babies. When 
a heartbeat could be detected, the baby 
is protected. 
We didn’t make exceptions for rape 
or incest or any other provisions. 
These babies are sacred. If there was a 
crime committed that resulted in con-
ception, that is on the rapist; that is 
not on the baby. And those babies are 
as precious to God as my own grand-
children are to God; and, of course, my 
grandchildren are extraordinarily pre-
cious to me. 
So I hope one day we get to that and 
that question. 
But as we move on, with this super-
aggressive utilization of freedom of 
speech and Senator SCHUMER, I look 
back at some of this discussion. And 
Chief Justice Roberts had a response, 
which is exceptionally rare, to have a 
statement come out of the Supreme 
Court. But out of the Chief Justice, he 
said, and I quote: ‘‘Threatening state-
ments of this sort, from the highest 
levels of government, are not only in-
appropriate, they are dangerous.’’ And 
Justices, quote, ‘‘will continue to do 
their job, without fear or favor, from 
whatever 
quarter.’’—Chief 
Justice 
John Roberts. 
I appreciate that language that the 
Justices will ‘‘continue to do their job, 
without fear or favor, from whatever 
quarter.’’ That language will live a 
long time in the way that that is 
adeptly put together, and that is how it 
needs to be. 
If we want to convince the Supreme 
Court to take a new look at things, we 
need to make the constitutional argu-
ments, Mr. Speaker, not the threat-
ening arguments. And where I come 
from, when somebody threatens you, 
that means that you are done doing 
business with that person, and they are 
very unlikely to get cooperation. 
But there is another part of this that, 
even though there would be a measure 
of justice involved if the decisions 
made in the Supreme Court went 
against the interests of Senator SCHU-
MER, I would like to reiterate here into 
this CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, and I hope 
it echoes across this land, that, if you 
think you are going to get even with 
somebody, the result in this business, 
whether it is in the legislative, the ex-
ecutive, or the judicial branch of gov-
ernment, if you think you are going to 
get even with somebody, you invari-
ably hurt the wrong people. 
And so that is not an avenue that has 
merit, and I hope that and I expect 
that that wisdom exists within all of 
our Justices, all nine of them over 
there, that payback to SCHUMER can’t 
be in the cards from any decision that 
would come down from the Court, it 
has got to be balanced and objective, as 
described by Chief Justice Roberts, and 
that they ‘‘continue to do their job, 
without fear or favor, from whatever 
quarter.’’ 
I believe the Justices will stick to 
that, and I am hopeful that Senator 
SCHUMER will learn not to utilize those 
tactics anymore. 
This is the American Bar Associa-
tion, the ABA. Their comments came 
down to this. They said they are ‘‘deep-
ly troubled’’ by SCHUMER’s remarks, 
that ‘‘there is no place for threats— 
whether real or allegorical.’’ 
And then the ABA, American Bar As-
sociation, continued with this: ‘‘Per-
sonal attacks on judges by any elected 
officials, including the President, are 
simply inappropriate. Such comments 
challenge the . . . independence of the 
judiciary and the personal safety of ju-
dicial officers. . . . ’’ 
Well, Mr. Speaker, I know that is 
true. I know that when you turn up the 
dialogue and you hear this radical 
rhetoric coming out of elected officials 
in particular, things do happen out in 
our society. And the Chief Justice is 
concerned that there could be acts of 
potential violence that could be stimu-
lated by that kind of dialogue. 
And I am hopeful that—Senator 
SCHUMER seemed to dial it down on the 
floor of the Senate today. That is good. 
I didn’t notice that he had called upon 
people to refrain from violence and re-
frain from threats. He did say that he 
is from the Bronx and they talk a little 
more clearly there than other places. I 
don’t doubt that. But this language 
went to the world, and the world saw it 
today, Mr. Speaker. 
And so I am hopeful that Senator 
SCHUMER will call upon his supporters 
to calm down, be logical, make con-
stitutional 
arguments, 
and 
refrain 
from that kind of rhetoric. 
And here are the consequences. I had 
some serious rhetoric applied against 
me over the last 11⁄2 years, and each of 
those situations that were—a good 
number of them were manufactured 
firestorms that were fired at me. 
But also, we saw Members of this 
House of Representatives that went 
forward and said, when people go into a 
restaurant, when they stop to get gas 
and you see them there, if they happen 
to be—I am not sure exactly how they 
defined it, but if they happen to be con-
servatives, go confront them, make 
their lives miserable. That kind of dis-
cussion was delivered from people who 
sit over on this side of the aisle, and it 
had its physical results. 
It had its physical results, at least in 
my case, where I sat down in a res-
taurant last April, and from com-
pletely outside my peripheral vision, I 
was assaulted. That individual has 
been convicted of assaulting a Federal 
officer, or a United States Congress-
man. There is a provision for that. 
And, by the way, today, he goes be-
fore a Federal judge in Sioux City for 
sentencing. 
So I won’t comment any more on 
that, because I don’t want to be ac-
cused of seeking to influence a decision 
that may or may not have been made, 
but it is ironic that I am here today 
having this discussion on Senator 
SCHUMER while there is an individual 
being sentenced for assaulting me back 
in Iowa, which I believe is a clear re-
sult of this kind of radical rhetoric 
that was poured out. 
And it wasn’t based on truth, in my 
case, when they attacked me. It was 
planned. It was orchestrated. It was 
ginned up. And then you have people 
out there that take that seriously. 
And so that is what happened that 
day, and the sentencing is taking place 
today. I will trust the judge to make 
an objective decision. I have written 
my opinion in longhand and sent that 
to the court for their consideration. 
That is where I will leave that rec-
ommendation. I have had my chance to 
weigh in. 
But let’s take this a little further, 
Mr. Speaker, and that is on this con-
cept of freedom of speech. Now, there 
are those that want to censure Senator 
SCHUMER, and it sounds like Senator 
HAWLEY is going to introduce a cen-
suring motion tomorrow in the Senate. 
I am of the opinion that the most im-
portant freedom we have is a robust 
freedom of speech and that, if we let 
that be diminished by intimidation 
tactics, let alone by any kind of laws 
that would perhaps be found unconsti-
tutional—but watching the Kelo deci-
sion, maybe not be found unconstitu-
tional. 
I want the body to understand this, 
Mr. Speaker, that freedom of speech is 
a precious, precious right, and our 
Founding Fathers understood that if 
you can’t speak, if you can’t speak 
freely, then you can’t convey your 
ideas at all. And then when you can’t 
convey your ideas, they never get test-
ed against anybody else’s ideas or em-
bellished or supported by other people’s 
ideas, and that means, then, that 
human knowledge would diminish, it 
would atrophy, and it would essentially 
stop forming around us. 
Our Founding Fathers envisioned a 
robust nation that would be regularly 
and constantly engaged in discussions 
of public policy, like we are in Iowa as 
the first-in-the-Nation caucus, like 
New Hampshire is, and let’s just say 
South Carolina is among those States, 
too, where there is an intense focus on 
politics, free discussion. 
I have spent time in Cuba and 
learned that they don’t have that free-
dom. They are afraid—even among 
their families sitting around the table, 
they are afraid to speak to each other 
because there might be an informant 
among them that has been hired by 
the, at that time, Castro administra-
tion. So they don’t speak to each other 
about those things. They don’t criti-
cize. They accept what government 
serves up to them.

That is what King George wanted to 
happen in this country. And if our 
predecessors here, the revolutionary 
Founding Fathers, had accepted the 
edict from King George, we would have 
never developed this great Nation that 
we are. We would be stuck back in the 
mud somewhere back there, because 
our ideas wouldn’t have been brought 
forward. They wouldn’t have been test-
ed against each other, then creating 
other new ideas. 
And, you know, we are the Nation 
that produces more patents, more cre-
ativity, than any other nation in the 
world by far. We are so good at this and 
we create so much with our intellec-
tual freedoms that we have that are 
tied into freedom of speech that the 
Chinese look to us and they steal a half 
a trillion dollars worth of American in-
tellectual property every year—a half a 
trillion dollars. And that doesn’t in-
clude what they steal through cyber. 
That is called IP piracy. 
I have been over to China. Years ago, 
I wrote a bill from Beijing that called 
upon the U.S. Trade Representative to 
conduct a study to determine the value 
of U.S. intellectual property that is 
stolen by the Chinese, apply a duty on 
all products coming to the United 
States from China in an amount equal 
to that loss, and then collect that and 
distribute it to the rightful property 
rights holders. That was a bill then. It 
is still a good idea today, but they have 
accelerated their piracy. 
Mr. Speaker, to give you an example 
of how this works, we know a little bit 
about how freedom of speech, thought, 
and expression works in the United 
States because we see—actually, in the 
past, we have seen a more robust free-
dom of speech on our campuses. Today, 
they are diminishing freedom of speech 
on the campuses. They are defining 
things as hate speech and trigger words 
and safe places. We don’t need that. We 
have got to be strong enough to face 
language and let it flow and then ac-
commodate ourselves in a way that we 
are not influenced if it isn’t logical or 
rational. 
The Greeks, for example, in their 
city-states, would banish a demagogue 
for 7 years from the city-state because 
they didn’t like what he had to say, 
and that wasn’t constructive. 
But what is constructive is our free-
dom of speech, our young people sitting 
in college, sitting up all night long dis-
cussing metaphysics till the Sun comes 
up, new ideas: What is the limitation 
on what we can do with science? with 
math? with space travel? All of those 
things that have made America the 
leader in the world, they are all tied 
back to freedom of speech. 
If you can’t speak, you can’t express 
your thoughts. You can’t just hold 
your thoughts in your head and think 
you are going to do something good 
with them. If we had taken Albert Ein-
stein and sat him into a phone booth 
and said, ‘‘We will let you out when 
you write the theory of relativity,’’ 
first of all, it never would have been 
created; second of all, nobody could 
have understood it. You have got to 
have the interactivity of minds. 
And people will say: We have the Sec-
ond Amendment; therefore, we are 
never going to lose our freedom of 
speech. I don’t see anybody using the 
Second Amendment to defend their 
freedom of speech, and I don’t rec-
ommend that they do. We have to uti-
lize our freedom of speech and push 
back when it is diminished. 
So I am not calling for a sanction on 
Senator SCHUMER. I am saying this: 
Senator SCHUMER, you know what 
you said. You know whether it is right 
or wrong. You have to operate in an 
arena over there and get reelected by 
the people in your district. Let we, the 
people, decide. Not a leader here in the 
Senate, not a leader here in the House, 
but let we, the people, decide. 
And, in fact, as a former chairman of 
the Constitution Committee, the three 
branches of government, there are ten-
sions between each of those. Our 
Founding Fathers didn’t envision that 
they would be equal. They believed the 
judicial branch would be the weakest of 
the three. But they knew there would 
be tension as that territory got marked 
out, and there is always going to be a 
gray area where there is a little bit of 
a tug-of-war over who has what terri-
tory. 
But in the end, if you analyze it—I 
can make your argument for the legis-
lature, even the House and the Senate. 
I can make it for the executive branch. 
I can make it for the judicial branch. 
But in the end, if any branch of govern-
ment gets out of whack, that means 
out of sync with the American people, 
we, the people, solve that problem in 
the election box. 
Sometimes it takes time. But that is 
the best solution is for we, the people, 
to make that decision, not a decision 
that sanctions freedom of speech, di-
minishes freedom of speech, or intimi-
dates people so that they don’t utilize 
their freedom of speech, because we 
have got to remain the most creative 
society in the history of the world, and 
in doing so, we will be the most suc-
cessful people also in the history of the 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 5, 2020 
No. 44 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
God of us all, thank You for this mo-
ment that unites us in the fellowship of 
prayer. Make us conscious of Your 
presence and unite us in our efforts to 
do Your will on Earth. 
Lord, inspire the hearts and minds of 
our lawmakers to strengthen the bonds 
between us, as they seek to live lives of 
integrity. May no partisanship mar the 
unity of spirit they must have to make 
America stronger, wiser, and better. 
Deliver them from every unworthy mo-
tive, as they labor to honor You. Lord, 
lift their burdens, lessen their fears, 
and give them Your peace. 
We pray, in Your great Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak in 
morning business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
JUDICIARY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
an independent judiciary is one of the 
cornerstones of our democracy. Judges 
serve lifetime appointments, free from 
political pressure so they can render 
impartial judgment without fear of ret-
ribution. 
Yesterday, unfortunately, our coun-
try took a step in the wrong direction 
with the Democratic leader’s com-
ments at a microphone in front of the 
Supreme Court. 
The Democratic leader harangued 
and 
warned 
Justices 
Gorsuch 
and 
Kavanaugh by name. He said they 
would ‘‘pay the price’’ and ‘‘won’t 
know what hit you if you go forward 
with these awful decisions.’’ 
At best, it was an injection of par-
tisan politics into a process that 
should be immune to these Justices. At 
worst, it was a threat, targeting two 
sitting members of the Supreme Court. 
Either way, I encourage my colleague, 
the Democratic leader, to apologize to 
those Supreme Court Justices and to 
do it here on the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
SUPREME COURT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I planned to spend my remarks today 
discussing our bipartisan, bicameral 
agreement to fund the fight against the 
new coronavirus. I was looking forward 
to congratulating all my colleagues 
and discussing all the ways this fund-
ing will help our public health experts, 
frontline healthcare professionals, and 
State and local officials combat the 
spread of this virus and mitigate its ef-
fects. It is a serious agreement to meet 
a serious challenge, and today we will 
send it to President Trump’s desk. 
So today will be an important day for 
the country, and it was going to be a 
proud day for the Senate, but instead 
the Nation’s eyes are on this body for 
an entirely different reason. 
A few weeks ago, I spoke on this floor 
about a dangerous trend that threatens 
our self-governance. I explained how 
some in the Democratic Party appear 
more interested in attacking the insti-
tutions of our government than in 
working within them, how Democrats 
increasingly respond to political dis-
appointments 
with 
extreme 
claims 
that our system of government itself 
must be broken. The failure can’t be 
their own. It can’t be that the left 
needs better arguments or ideas. No. 
No, the fault must lie with the Con-
stitution itself. 
Democrats have tried to cloak their 
anger at President Trump in rhetoric 
about protecting norms and institu-
tions, but, in reality, it is their own 
side of the aisle where anti-institution-
alism is rampant. Rampant. We can 
talk about attacks on the office of the 
Presidency, on the Electoral College, 
on the First Amendment, on the Sen-
ate itself, but most striking of all has 
been the shameless efforts to bully our 
Nation’s independent judiciary, and 
yesterday those efforts took a dan-
gerous and disturbing turn. 
By now many already know what the 
Democratic leader shouted outside the 
Supreme Court yesterday morning. I 
am sorry to have to read it into the 
RECORD. First, he prompted a crowd of 
leftwing activists to boo two of the As-
sociate Justices—as though Supreme 
Court Justices were professional ath-
letes and Senator SCHUMER were jeer-
ing from the stands. Then the senior 
Senator from New York said this: 
I want to tell you, Gorsuch! I want to tell 
you, Kavanaugh! You have released the 
whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You 
won’t know what hit you if you go forward 
with these awful decisions. 
I am not sure where to start. 
There is nothing to call this except a 
threat, and there is absolutely no ques-
tion to whom—to whom it was di-
rected. 
Contrary to what the Democratic 
leader has since tried to claim, he very, 
very clearly was not addressing Repub-
lican lawmakers or anyone else. He lit-
erally directed the statement to the 
Justices by name. He said: ‘‘[I]f you go 
forward with these awful decisions,’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1510 
March 5, 2020 
which could only apply to the Court 
itself. The minority leader of the 
United States Senate threatened two 
Associate Justices of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. Period. There is no other way to 
interpret that. 
Even worse, the threat was not clear-
ly political or institutional. As I will 
discuss in a moment, these kinds of 
threats are sadly nothing new from 
Senate Democrats. This was much 
broader—much broader. 
The Democratic leader traveled to 
the workplace of the two Justices, and 
in front of a crowd of activists, he told 
those Justices ‘‘you will pay the price’’ 
right in front of the Supreme Court 
building and ‘‘you won’t know what hit 
you.’’ He said this right in front of the 
Supreme Court building. 
If any American had these words 
shouted at them from a sidewalk out-
side their office, they would hear those 
threats as personal, and most likely 
they would hear them as threatening 
or inciting violence. That is how any 
American would interpret those words 
if they were directed at them. That is 
certainly how the press and leading 
Democrats would have characterized 
them if President Trump or any senior 
Republican had said anything even re-
motely—remotely—similar. We have 
seen much more hay made out of much 
less. 
Perhaps our colleague thinks this is 
absurd. Perhaps he would like the most 
generous possible interpretation; that 
he got carried away and he didn’t mean 
what he said, but if he cannot even 
admit to saying what he said, we cer-
tainly cannot know what he meant. 
At the very best, his comments were 
astonishingly reckless and completely 
irresponsible. Clearly, as the Chief Jus-
tice stated in a rare and extraordinary 
rebuke, they were ‘‘dangerous’’ because 
no matter the intention, words car-
rying the apparent threat of violence 
can have horrific, unintended con-
sequences. 
In the most recent year on record, 
the U.S. Marshal Service tracked thou-
sands of threats and inappropriate 
communications against the judici-
ary—thousands of threats against the 
judiciary. 
Less than 3 years ago, of course, an 
unhinged and unstable leftwing activ-
ist attempted a mass murder of con-
gressional Republicans at a baseball 
field right across the river. 
A Senate leader appearing to threat-
en or incite violence on the steps of the 
Supreme Court could literally be a 
matter of deadly seriousness. 
So I fully anticipate our colleague 
would quickly withdraw his comments 
and apologize. That is what even reli-
ably liberal legal experts like Laurence 
Tribe and Neal Katyal have publicly 
urged. 
Instead, 
our 
colleague 
doubled 
down—doubled down. He tried to gas-
light the entire country and stated 
that he was actually threatening fellow 
Senators, as though that would be 
much better, but that is a fiction. A 
few hours later, the Democratic leader 
tripled down. Instead of taking Chief 
Justice Roberts’ sober and appropriate 
statement to heart, he lashed out, yet 
again, and tried to imply the Chief Jus-
tice was biased—biased—for doing his 
job and defending the Court. Let me 
say that again. He tripled down, and he 
lashed out, yet again, and tried to 
imply that the Chief Justice was biased 
for doing his job and defending the 
Court. Our colleague therefore suc-
ceeded in attacking 33 percent of the 
Supreme Court in a space of a few 
hours. 
Throughout the impeachment and 
the Senate trial, for months, Wash-
ington Democrats preached sermons 
about the separation of powers and re-
spect among equal branches. 
So much for all of that. And sadly, 
this attack was not some isolated inci-
dent. The leftwing campaign against 
the Federal Judiciary did not begin 
yesterday—not 
yesterday. 
My 
col-
leagues will recall that during the im-
peachment trial the senior Senator 
from Massachusetts and outside pres-
sure groups tried to attack the Chief 
Justice, sitting right in that chair, for 
staying neutral instead of delivering 
the outcomes that they wanted. These 
same groups came to Senator SCHU-
MER’s defense yesterday with gratu-
itous attacks against the Chief Justice 
for condemning the threats against his 
colleagues. 
Last summer—last summer a number 
of Senate Democrats sent an extraor-
dinary brief to the Supreme Court. It 
threatened 
to 
inflict 
institutional 
change on the Court if it did not rule 
the way the Democrats wanted. In 
other words, give us the ruling we want 
or we will change the numbers of the 
Court. Here is what they wrote: ‘‘The 
Supreme Court is not well. . . . ’’ 
Really? 
The Supreme Court is not well. . . . Per-
haps the Court can heal itself before the pub-
lic demands it be ‘‘restructured . . . ’’ 
What that means is, you rule the way 
we want or we are going to expand the 
numbers and change the outcome—a 
political threat, plain as day. As you 
read the document, you half expected 
it to end by saying: That is some nice 
judicial independence you got over 
there. It would be a shame if something 
happened to it. 
It couldn’t have been more clear. 
Independence from political passions is 
the cornerstone of our judiciary in our 
country. Judicial independence is what 
enables courts to do justice even when 
it is unpopular, to protect constitu-
tional rights even when powerful inter-
ests want them infringed. Judicial 
independence is what makes the United 
States of America a republic of laws 
rather than of men. 
It has been almost a century since 
the last time Democrats threatened to 
pack the Supreme Court because they 
wanted different rulings. History still 
judges that disgraceful episode to this 
day. 
I would suggest that my Democratic 
colleagues spend less time trying to 
threaten impartial judges and more 
time coming up with ideas that are ac-
tually constitutional. 
Fortunately, this extraordinary dis-
play contains one ironic silver lining. 
These clumsy efforts to erode a pillar 
of American governance have just re-
minded everyone why that pillar is so 
crucial. These efforts to attack judicial 
independence remind us that independ-
ence is essential. Every time Demo-
crats try to threaten sitting judges, we 
are 
reminded 
exactly—exactly—why 
the Framers gave them life tenure and 
salary protection, precisely why they 
did it. Every time Democrats toy with 
packing new seats onto the Court, we 
are reminded exactly why, as Justice 
Ginsburg recently said, ‘‘Nine seems to 
be a good number.’’ Justice Ginsburg 
said, ‘‘Nine seems to be a good num-
ber.’’ 
The distinguished men and women of 
the Supreme Court do not and must 
not serve at the pleasure of angry par-
tisans—must not serve at the pleasure 
of angry partisans. They do not need to 
pay any mind to unhinged threats, as 
shameful as they may be. In fact, as 
the Chief Justice reminded us yester-
day, they are duty-bound to pay such 
things no attention at all. Their job de-
scription is simple: to apply the law to 
the facts, as the Chief Justice put it, 
‘‘without fear or favor from whatever 
quarter.’’ I have great confidence the 
Court will do just that. I am confident 
that if the facts and the Constitution 
would have led the Court to disappoint 
Democrats the day before yesterday, 
they would still feel free to do so 
today, tomorrow, and beyond, notwith-
standing these shameful tactics. 
I had hoped I would not need to reit-
erate what every Republican Senator 
told the Court in August after Senate 
Democrats sent their threatening brief, 
but today I have no choice but to say it 
again: Republicans are absolutely and 
unshakably committed to the core con-
stitutional principle of an independent 
Federal judiciary—the core constitu-
tional principle of an independent Fed-
eral judiciary. 
As long as this majority holds the 
gavel, we will never let the minority 
leader’s dangerous views become pol-
icy. This majority will ensure that the 
only casualties of this recklessness are 
the reputations of those who engage in 
it.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
just listened to the Republican leader, 
and there was a glaring omission in his 
speech. He did not mention what the 
rally yesterday, my speech, or the case 
before the Court was about—a woman’s 
constitutional right to choose. 
To the women of America: What we 
are talking about here, what I am 
fighting for here is your right to 
choose—an issue, of course, Leader 
MCCONNELL completely ignored in his 
speech. I feel so passionately about this 
issue, and I feel so deeply the anger of 
women all across America about Sen-
ate Republicans and the courts work-
ing hand in glove to take down Roe v. 
Wade. 
I just read about a woman in Shreve-
port who, under the Louisiana law now 
before the Supreme Court, would have 
to travel over 300 miles to exercise her 
constitutional freedoms. And this is 
happening in States across the coun-
try. 
Republican State legislatures are re-
stricting a woman’s right to choose so 
severely as to make it nonexistent, and 
the courts are now likely to go along 
because Senate Republicans have con-
firmed nominees they believe will strip 
away women’s rights and fundamen-
tally change this country, going so far 
as to deny a duly elected President the 
right to pick a Supreme Court Justice. 
Republicans here in the Senate are 
afraid to confront this issue directly. 
So they try to accomplish through the 
courts what they would never accom-
plish in the court of public opinion, and 
they leave women out in the cold. 
So, yes, I am angry. The women of 
America are angry. And, yes, we will 
continue to fight for a woman’s right 
to choose. I will continue to fight for 
the women of America. 
Now, I should not have used the 
words I used yesterday. They didn’t 
come out the way I intended to. My 
point was that there would be political 
consequences—political consequences— 
for President Trump and Senate Re-
publicans if the Supreme Court, with 
the newly confirmed Justices, stripped 
away a woman’s right to choose. Of 
course, I didn’t intend to suggest any-
thing other than political and public 
opinion consequences for the Supreme 
Court, and it is a gross distortion to 
imply otherwise. 
I am from Brooklyn. We speak in 
strong language. I shouldn’t have used 
the words I did, but in no way was I 
making a threat. I never—never— 
would do such a thing. Leader MCCON-
NELL knows that, and Republicans who 
are busy manufacturing outrage over 
these comments know that too. 
What will remain long after the 
clamor over my comments dies down is 
the issue at hand: a woman’s constitu-
tional right to choose and Republican 
attempts to invalidate it. 
The fact that my Republican col-
leagues have worked systematically 
over the course of decades to install 
the judicial infrastructure to take 
down Roe v. Wade and do very real 
damage to the country and to the 
American way of life—that is the issue 
that will remain, and we owe—I owe— 
an obligation to the women of America 
to fight for their constitutional rights. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this morning as a 
Senate colleague who may know CHUCK 
SCHUMER better than most. We lived 
under the same roof for almost 20 
years. We know one another. We know 
each other’s families. We have been to-
gether through moments of sadness 
and triumph. I know him well, and I 
come to the floor this morning to make 
this statement. 
I respect Chief Justice John Roberts, 
but I respectfully disagree with the 
statement he made yesterday about 
Senator SCHUMER’s comments before 
the Supreme Court Building. It is not 
in CHUCK SCHUMER’s nature to phys-
ically threaten anyone—anyone—or to 
create a dangerous situation for any 
person. That is just not CHUCK SCHU-
MER. Even his passion, as you just 
heard about the issue of women’s 
healthcare, would not lead him to that 
position. Yes, as he said, he could have 
chosen his words more carefully, but is 
there a person in public life who has 
ever stood in this Chamber or any 
other who wouldn’t say the same about 
some public utterance? 
What troubles me is his being admon-
ished publicly by President Donald 
Trump for his use of words—being ad-
monished by President Trump for his 
use of words. It just takes your breath 
away to think that this President, with 
his thousands of tweets and statements 
and utterances—outrageous as they 
have been—would be standing as a 
judge of others when it comes to the 
use of language. 
I listened carefully this morning as 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader, came to the floor and spoke, 
when he talked about his singular re-
spect for the Supreme Court and judi-
cial independence. He used the phrase 
repeatedly: 
‘‘judicial 
independence.’’ 
He called the judiciary, rightly, a pil-
lar of the American Government. 
Does Senator MCCONNELL think we 
have forgotten what he did when it 
came to the Supreme Court after Jus-
tice Scalia passed away? He inten-
tionally left a vacancy in the Court for 
almost a year for political purposes be-
fore it was filled. 
We remember when President Obama, 
in the last year of his Presidency, of-
fered the nomination of Merrick Gar-
land, a highly respected circuit court 
judge for the District of Columbia. Do 
you remember what this Republican 
leader, Senator MCCONNELL, did in re-
sponse—this man who so admires this 
pillar of the American Government, 
the judiciary? He refused to even per-
sonally meet with Merrick Garland, 
President Obama’s nominee, and he in-
structed his colleagues on the Repub-
lican side to do the same, to shun him, 
to give him the cold shoulder, and to 
make it clear that, for a year, there 
would be a vacancy in the Court be-
cause he, Senator MCCONNELL, was 
praying he would get a political oppor-
tunity to fill that vacancy if a Repub-
lican were elected to the Presidency. 
And, of course, that is what happened 
in 2016. 
So for Senator MCCONNELL to come 
before us and talk about his respect for 
the Court, keeping politics out of the 
Court, calling it a pillar of the Amer-
ican Government—has he forgotten 
what he did to Merrick Garland? 
Incidentally, despite his constitu-
tional contortion that, for some rea-
son, in the last year of a Presidency, 
that President has given up any con-
stitutional right to fill a vacancy, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL was recently asked: 
Well, what if that happens in the last 
year of President Trump’s administra-
tion? 
Well, he wasted no time saying: Of 
course, I would let President Trump fill 
the vacancy—as transparent as pos-
sible his partisan motives when it 
comes to that Supreme Court. 
So if he wants to show respect for the 
Court, it certainly has not been dem-
onstrated, starting with the vacancy of 
Justice Scalia. 
And how about Senator MCCONNELL’s 
single-minded effort to fill every Fed-
eral vacancy across the United States 
as quickly as possible, sadly, with 
many men and women who scarcely 
have any experience of service in our 
judicial system? 
So far, President Trump has sent to 
this Senate, with Senator MCCONNELL’s 
acceptance and approval, nine nomi-
nees for the Federal Judiciary who 
have been found ‘‘not qualified’’ by the 
American Bar Association, many of 
them 
unanimously—nine 
men 
and 
women who have such extreme back-
grounds or such limited experience 
that they shouldn’t sit on the Federal 
bench. But Senator MCCONNELL, with

his respect for the judiciary, couldn’t 
wait to give them lifetime appoint-
ments. 
Oh, you ask: Wait a minute. What 
about President Obama? How many did 
he send to the Senate who were found 
‘‘not qualified’’ by the American Bar 
Association? None. None, not one. 
That is what we are facing here with 
Senator MCCONNELL’s singular strategy 
to fill the courts with people who share 
his 
extreme 
views 
on 
women’s 
healthcare, on civil rights, and on so 
many other fundamental issues. 
So preaching on this floor about your 
respect for the Supreme Court, your re-
spect for our Federal judiciary doesn’t 
go very far when you take a close look 
at the record that Senator MCCONNELL 
has written. 
At this point, let me suggest that we 
move forward from this day and not 
dwell on what the morning headlines 
might be. We have work to do, and it 
would be better if we did it in a bipar-
tisan fashion, with respect for one an-
other. 
I stand ready to work with those on 
the other side of the aisle to achieve 
that goal, but I want to say at this mo-
ment that dwelling on this particular 
chapter doesn’t serve the American 
people. They didn’t send us here to 
squabble and fight. They sent us here 
to pass important legislation that re-
spects their right to quality, acces-
sible, and affordable healthcare. They 
sent us here to make sure that women 
have the basic constitutional right to 
make the most important personal de-
cisions of their lives. They sent us here 
to make sure that we serve this coun-
try in giving working families a fight-
ing chance. All of the other things that 
we spend time talking about on this 
floor diminish in comparison. 
It is time for us to roll up our sleeves 
and let the Senate be more than a 
rubberstamp for Federal judicial nomi-
nations when there are partisan goals 
in mind by Senator MCCONNELL and 
others. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SUPREME COURT 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as I 
begin this morning, I want to associate 
myself with the remarks of the Repub-
lican leader, Senator MCCONNELL, ear-
lier this morning. 
The attacks that were made by the 
Democratic leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
on the Supreme Court yesterday were 
not only irresponsible; they were reck-
less and they were shameful. I think we 
need to just call that what it is. 
For them to suggest—for him to sug-
gest—that this isn’t what he meant and 
that this is somehow manufactured 
outrage on the part of us or Repub-
licans in general doesn’t fit with the 
way that these comments came across 
either, because I want to read for you 
from the CNN Supreme Court reporter: 
‘‘Schumer, speaking at a rally of abor-
tion rights supporters, appeared to 
threaten 
Kavanaugh 
and 
Gorsuch, 
President Trump’s two Supreme Court 
nominees who were confirmed after 
bruising nomination fights.’’ 
That is the interpretation not of FOX 
News but of CNN. 
I think we need to be very clear: 
When comments like that are made 
that threaten an independent judiciary 
in this country, they need to be called 
out and they need to be walked back. I 
appreciate the fact that the Demo-
cratic leader acknowledged today that 
he should have said it differently, but 
it doesn’t in any way diminish what 
was said or the context in which it was 
said or the attacks that were made on 
the Supreme Court. 
It needs to be recognized as that, and 
I think all of us need to be, as U.S. 
Senators, 
aware—aware—no 
matter 
what the audience, particularly when 
you are the Democratic leader, of how 
these things come across and what 
they mean to the people who have been 
threatened by them. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, I am pleased that 
Republicans and Democrats in both 
Chambers have quickly come together 
to provide emergency funding to com-
bat the coronavirus, and I look forward 
to voting this afternoon to send this 
important funding measure to the 
President’s desk. 
5G 
Madam President, on another sub-
ject, our Nation is poised for the wide-
spread deployment of the next genera-
tion of internet technology: 5G. With 
its incredible speed and connectivity, 
5G will usher in a new era of innova-
tion. Advances in medical care, the 
large-scale deployment of precision ag-
riculture, safer transportation tech-
nologies—5G will bring all of these 
things and more. 
But, like any new technology, 5G 
networks will present new risks and 
vulnerabilities. Because 5G will mean a 
vastly greater number of connected de-
vices, the risks with 5G will be greater. 
That is why an essential part of de-
ploying 5G networks has to be looking 
at how we can mitigate security risks. 
Yesterday, the Senate Committee on 
Commerce, 
Science, 
and 
Transpor-
tation, of which I am a member, held a 
hearing on supply chain risks for 5G. 
We need to ensure that the component 
parts of our devices and, critically, the 
component 
parts 
of 
telecommuni-
cations networks, like cell towers and 
the small cells that will be required for 
5G, are secure. 
That means ensuring that 5G equip-
ment comes from trusted vendors. Cur-
rently, one of the biggest suppliers of 
5G equipment worldwide is a Chinese 
company—Huawei—which is supported 
by the Chinese Government. American 
security officials have raised concerns 
that much of Huawei’s equipment is 
built with ‘‘backdoors,’’ giving the Chi-
nese Government access to global com-
munications networks. 
The United States has taken a num-
ber of steps to prevent equipment from 
Huawei and another suspect Chinese 
company, ZTE, from being used in U.S. 
communications networks, but these 
companies still pose a risk to the 
United States. For starters, some U.S. 
broadband providers, often in rural 
areas, 
still 
have 
equipment 
from 
Huawei and ZTE in their communica-
tions networks, and a number of our al-
lies and trade partners, entities with 
whom we regularly share information— 
including sensitive national security 
information—have used or are using 
technology from Huawei and ZTE. 
Yesterday’s 
Commerce 
Committee 
hearing focused on both of these issues. 
We discussed so-called ‘‘rip and re-
place,’’ an initiative already underway 
to replace suspect telecommunications 
components with hardware from trust-
ed companies. 
Last week, the Senate unanimously 
passed the Secure and Trusted Commu-
nications Networks Act, which is now 
with the President to be signed into 
law. This legislation will help tele-
communications providers with the 
cost of replacing network components 
that pose a security risk. I cosponsored 
this legislation, which was developed 
by Commerce Committee Chairman 
ROGER WICKER. 
Madam President, cost is a major ob-
stacle for small broadband providers 
when it comes to replacing 
tele-
communications hardware, but, as one 
expert witness at the hearing noted, a 
lack of qualified telecommunications 
workers also poses a barrier to replace-
ment. 
I recently introduced legislation, the 
Telecommunications 
Skilled 
Work-
force Act, to help increase the number 
of workers on the frontlines of replac-
ing this equipment and deploying new, 
secure 5G networks. I hope this legisla-
tion will quickly make its way through 
the 
Senate. 
Replacing 
problematic 
hardware 
in 
our 
domestic 
tele-
communications networks will help en-
sure the security of our communica-
tions for years to come. 
As I said earlier, that is not the only 
challenge that we are facing. We regu-
larly exchange information, including 
sensitive national security informa-
tion, with our allies and trading part-
ners, and this information can only be 
secure if networks on both ends are se-
cure. That is why the United States 
has called for other countries to reject 
telecommunications technology from 
Huawei and ZTE. While some countries 
have committed to using trusted com-
panies to build out their telecommuni-
cations networks, other countries are 
still planning to make use of Huawei’s 
technology. 
That is why I am introducing legisla-
tion today to make telecommuni-
cations security a key objective when

negotiating future trade deals. This 
legislation is critical as the United 
States begins formal trade talks with 
the United Kingdom and with other al-
lies. We should be using trade agree-
ments to push for enhanced network 
security globally, which would benefit 
not only our country but every country 
with which we do business. 
As one witness noted at yesterday’s 
hearing, this legislation is ‘‘long over-
due.’’ I could not agree more. Over the 
past few years, we have talked a lot 
about the importance of having the 
United States win the global race to 
5G. There are important reasons for 
that. For starters, having the United 
States at the forefront of 5G tech-
nology will mean big benefits for our 
economy and for American workers, 
but there are also important security 
reasons to have the United States at 
the head of the 5G revolution. If we 
lead the world in implementing 5G, we 
will have the chance to set standards 
for 5G deployment—including, most 
importantly, network security stand-
ards. 
It is no exaggeration to say that hav-
ing the chance to set worldwide stand-
ards for 5G is critical—it is critical—to 
our 
national 
security. 
Our 
tele-
communications networks already play 
a huge role in our national security, 
and that role will only grow as we fully 
adopt 5G technology. We need to en-
sure that U.S. networks are as secure 
as it is possible for them to be. 
I appreciated the witnesses who took 
the time to address the Commerce 
Committee yesterday. There is no bet-
ter way to learn what needs to be done 
for 5G security than to hear from the 
people on the ground who spend every 
waking day managing network secu-
rity issues. I look forward to con-
tinuing to work with all of my col-
leagues in the Senate to advance tele-
communications security and ensure 
that the United States is fully prepared 
for the 5G future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, later in 
the day, I will be making a motion to 
table the Paul amendment that would 
require offsetting the $7.76 billion for 
the coronavirus against the foreign op-
erations account. 
Senator PAUL is at it again. He is 
consistent. I respect his view; I just re-
ject it. What he would be doing is basi-
cally upending the fiscal year 2020 
agreement on foreign assistance spend-
ing passed by Congress and signed into 
law by President Trump. He would be 
putting our Nation at risk if this 
amendment actually passed. 
One percent of the Federal spending 
is foreign assistance in different fash-
ions and ways, including our commit-
ment to our friends in Israel and other 
programs we have that I think are na-
tional-defense oriented. 
The U.S. Global Leadership Coali-
tion—consisting 
of 
500 
businesses, 
NGOs, military, and faith leaders—has 
warned that ‘‘cuts of this magnitude 
would have devastating consequences 
on our ability to confront unprece-
dented 
global 
challenges—including 
countering China’s growing influence 
around the world, supporting partners 
in the fight against extremism, and ad-
dressing the impacts of the Venezuelan 
refugee crisis on key allies like Colom-
bia.’’ 
I would even go further: This cut 
would devastate the foreign assistance 
account in terms of being able to deal 
effectively with the effects of the virus 
overseas. 
David Beasley, head of the World 
Food Programme, warned in an AP ar-
ticle, which I would like to make part 
of the RECORD, that ‘‘if the coronavirus 
continues to create panic around the 
world, and there is an economic down-
turn, I have been telling European 
leaders, and leaders around the world, 
you don’t have enough money set aside 
to address the needs in Africa, East Af-
rica, West Africa, in the Middle East 
right now.’’ 
We are only beginning to understand 
the cost associated with the virus. 
I 
want 
to 
compliment 
Senators 
SHELBY
and LEAHY
for putting this 
package together. I compliment the 
White House, the Senate, and the 
House. There was a huge vote in the 
House. 
If we accept Senator PAUL’s offset 
amendment, we will be devastating our 
ability as a nation to deal with this 
matter overseas. 
As to Senator PAUL’s world view, I 
have consistently rejected it. When it 
comes to international terrorism, I 
have no desire to go back to the pre-9/ 
11 footprint of where we ignore prob-
lems over there, hoping they will not 
come here. When it comes to fighting 
disease and containing viruses, I think 
we understand that we have to be 
present over there, and in an effective 
way, to control the spread of the 
coronavirus, Ebola, and other diseases 
that can make their way to America. 
We have always rejected these types 
of offsets by Senator PAUL. I think the 
best thing we can do is have an over-
whelming bipartisan vote. Count me in 
for dealing with the deficit, but this is 
penny wise and pound foolish because 
the $7.6 billion, if it is taken out of the 
foreign operations account, makes this 
country less safe on multiple fronts. 
I will be making a motion to table at 
the appropriate time. And I urge my 
colleagues to understand that what 
happens over there matters to us over 
here. This would devastate programs 
like 
the 
Benjamin 
Gilman 
Inter-
national Scholarships and participant 
schools like Berea College and Western 
Kentucky University. There is a ripple 
effect of enormous proportions. It is 
not going to do much for the debt, but 
it will do a lot to make us less safe. 
I yield to Senator LEAHY. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my friend 
and colleague on the floor—I totally 
agree with what he just said. Senator 
SHELBY
and I will be giving longer 
statements in a few minutes. 
Senator GRAHAM and I have had the 
duty to put through the Foreign Oper-
ations bill for a number of years now. 
We tried to do it in a bipartisan and 
nonpartisan way, and as a result, it has 
gotten very strong support from both 
sides of the aisle, which is what we 
hope will happen now. 
I will certainly be voting with Sen-
ator GRAHAM’s motion to table when he 
makes it. Every Senator—he or she— 
can vote any way they want, but I 
would note for our colleagues, Senator 
SHELBY and I and key Senators—in-
cluding the Senator now on the floor— 
in both parties have worked every day, 
every evening, our staffs on weekends, 
in order to get to where we are. This is 
a product of every single Republican, 
every single Democrat who wanted a 
voice in this, a chance to speak to it. 
Both Senator SHELBY, as chairman, 
and I, as vice chairman, made sure that 
voices were heard. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to again 
compliment you and Senator SHELBY. 
You always deliver. You always seem 
to be able to do things that other peo-
ple can’t do at a time when we need 
you to deliver for the body and the 
country. 
Mr. President, I would like to have 
printed in the RECORD an article, ‘‘UN 
food aid chief fears for Africa, Mideast 
amid new crises,’’ and a U.S. Global 
Leadership 
Coalition 
letter, 
dated 
March 5, 2020. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
UN FOOD AID CHIEF FEARS FOR AFRICA, 
MIDEAST AMID NEW CRISES 
[March 5, 2020] 
AMMAN, JORDAN
(AP)—The head of the 
U.N.’s food aid agency warned of ‘‘absolute 
devastation’’ in Africa and parts of the Mid-
dle East in coming months if wealthier na-
tions grappling with an economic downturn 
linked to the new coronavirus don’t step up 
aid efforts in countries in need. 
David Beasley, head of the World Food 
Program, told The Associated Press that the 
convergence of several crises could further 
destabilize conflict-scarred regions. 
‘‘If the corona virus continues to create 
panic around the world, and there is an eco-
nomic downturn, I have been telling the Eu-
ropean leaders, and leaders around the world, 
you don’t have enough money set aside to 
address the needs in Africa, East Africa, 
West Africa, in the Middle East right now,’’ 
Beasley said during an interview in Jordan 
late Wednesday, after a visit to Syria. 
‘‘If there is an economic downturn, on top 
of the economic downturn that exists now in 
Syria and Lebanon, it absolutely could be a 
catastrophe,’’ he said. ‘‘I mean absolute dev-
astation. I am very concerned about what 
would happen in the next six months. You

could see destabilization unlike any time pe-
riod, maybe in my lifetime.’’ 
In the Middle East, Iran has been hardest 
hit by the new virus which has spread around 
the globe after first being detected in the 
Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. There 
are over 3,740 cases of the virus across the 
Mideast, with most linking back to the Is-
lamic Republic which also confirmed dozens 
of deaths. Only a small number of cases has 
been reported in Sub-Saharan Africa so far. 
Beasley did not give an amount for addi-
tional aid needed, but suggested it would be 
in the billions of dollars. Beasley spoke after 
a tour of Syria’s northwestern ldlib province, 
the country’s last rebel stronghold, where 
hundreds of thousands of civilians have been 
displaced in recent weeks by a Russian- 
backed Syrian government offensive. 
U.N. agencies, including the WFP, are dis-
tributing aid in ldlib, but are often hampered 
by logistics problems, including shifting 
front lines, access restrictions and roads 
clogged by large numbers of people on the 
move. 
The leaders of Russia, which backs the 
Syrian government, and Turkey, which 
backs the rebels, were meeting in Moscow on 
Thursday to try to avert further calamity. 
But any deal will likely bring only a tem-
porary halt in the punishing offensive by the 
military of Syria’s President Bashar Assad, 
which threatens continued suffering for the 3 
million people trapped in ldlib. 
Beasley appealed to leaders on all sides of 
the Syrian conflict to end the war, which has 
raged for nine years. ‘‘Enough is enough,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Too many people have suffered too 
long.’’ 
U.S. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP COALITION, 
March 5, 2020. 
Hon. LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Chairman, Subcommittee on State-Foreign Oper-
ations, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. 
Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. PATRICK LEAHY, 
Ranking Member, Subcommittee on State-For-
eign Operations, Committee on Appropria-
tions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRAHAM
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER LEAHY: On behalf of the more than 
500 business and NGO members of the U.S. 
Global Leadership Coalition {USGLC), in-
cluding business, military, and faith-based 
leaders in all 50 states, I write in strong op-
position to an amendment proposed by Sen-
ator Rand Paul that would offset emergency 
funding to address the growing coronavirus 
threat by canceling over $8 billion in con-
gressionally approved funds for the Inter-
national Affairs Budget. 
If enacted, this amendment would cancel 
critical 
funding 
for 
State 
Department, 
USAID, and other development programs 
around the world, undermining our national 
security and economic interests and placing 
America’s global leadership at risk. Cuts of 
this magnitude would have devastating con-
sequences on our ability to confront unprece-
dented global challenges—including coun-
tering China’s growing influence around the 
world, supporting partners in the fight 
against extremism, and addressing the im-
pacts of the Venezuelan refugee crisis on key 
allies like Colombia. 
There is a strong bipartisan legacy in the 
Senate of rejecting deep and dangerous cuts 
to America’s development and diplomacy 
programs. I urge the Senate to once again 
take decisive action and reject Senator 
Paul’s shortsighted amendment. Doing so 
will ensure that resources already approved 
by Congress can be fully deployed to support 
cost-effective programs that advance Amer-
ica’s interests. 
Thank you for your unwavering support of 
America’s international affairs programs and 
your commitment to strengthening the crit-
ical resources needed to advance America’s 
global leadership. 
Sincerely, 
LIZ SCHRAYER, 
President & CEO, USGLC. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wrap 
up by saying that Senator PAUL is con-
sistent. Every time he wants to pay for 
something, he comes to the foreign as-
sistance account. I understand the ar-
gument: Why are we spending over 
there when we have problems here? 
That sounds good until you realize how 
the world is. 
On September 10, 2001, the day before 
9/11, we didn’t have one soldier in Af-
ghanistan, not an embassy, not an am-
bassador, not a dime of aid. The 
Taliban were in charge, and they gave 
al-Qaida safe haven. That is where the 
planning of the attacks and 9/11 origi-
nated. Looking back, wouldn’t it have 
been nice to have had some influence 
in Afghanistan on September 10? 
All I can say is, I will never go back 
to that pre-9/11 mindset of ignoring the 
world, because I have learned, like 
most Americans, the world can come 
here in a very bad way or very good 
way, depending on how we defend our-
selves. 
This 1 percent of the budget—foreign 
assistance to deal with problems over 
there—is absolutely essential in terms 
of global health. He exempted the glob-
al health component of the foreign as-
sistance account, but the money—$7.76 
billion—will destroy other things in 
the account that I think are vital to 
our public health here and our national 
security and our alliances. You cannot 
fight problems like this by yourself. 
You need partners. You need to get in-
volved over there so the virus doesn’t 
spread any more here than necessary. 
I hope that people will listen to what 
Senator LEAHY just said, that this was 
a negotiated agreement. We all came 
together to get a budget. Senators 
SHELBY and LEAHY did a wonderful job 
working with the House and the White 
House to get us to where we are today. 
This amendment would upset every-
thing. I am going to move to table it at 
the appropriate time. 
With that, I suggest the absence of a 
quorum.

TRUE EQUITY ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, at the 
end of fiscal year 2021, the 5-year au-
thorization for the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act, our Nation’s 
foundational prekindergarten through 
12th grade law, is due to expire. 
While I understand that previous re-
authorizations took 13 years and al-
lowed an entire generation of students 
to matriculate through school systems 
around our Nation, I am here today to 
stress that our kids can’t wait for the 
needed transformational changes to 
our Nation’s Federal, State, and local 
education policies and additional fund-
ing investments. 
To provide a stronger Federal part-
nership to States and local commu-
nities that have worked together to 
support transformational change that 
will ensure educational equity and 
quality for all public school students, I 
introduced the TRUE EQUITY Act. It 
stands for the Transformational Re-
forms and Updates to Ensure Edu-
cational Quality and Urgent Invest-
ments in Today’s Youth Act. 
My home State of Maryland has been 
long recognized as having one of the 
best public school systems in the coun-
try, 
according 
to 
the 
independent 
newspaper 
Education 
Week. 
This 
ranges from having entire county- 
based local school systems ranked as 
near the top in the Nation to indi-
vidual schools producing national lead-
ers in academic achievement. In addi-
tion, Maryland was one of the first 
States to offer half-day preschool for 4- 
year-olds, has broad access to Ad-
vanced Placement courses for high 
schoolers, and pays for dual-enrollment 
courses for high school students at our 
local community colleges. 
I am proud of these accomplish-
ments. However, not all of our students 
have found success. 
In 2016, the Maryland General Assem-
bly and the Governor of Maryland es-
tablished the Maryland Commission on 
Innovation and Excellence in Edu-
cation, chaired by the former chan-
cellor of the University System of 
Maryland, William ‘‘Brit’’ Kirwan, to 
identify the policies and practices so 
that Maryland’s schools perform at the 
level of the world’s highest performing 
school system. The commission was 
charged with a number of tasks, in-
cluding a review of the current funding 
formulas and accountability measures 
utilized to ensure educational equity 
and equality, how Maryland schools 
prepare 
students 
for 
postsecondary 
education in the workforce, and to 
make recommendations for the State 
on 
needed 
funding 
improvements 
across the State and local school dis-
tricts. 
These reviews are necessary to sup-
port growing populations of children 
with disabilities, how to improve and 
expand programs supporting postsec-
ondary 
credential 
attainment, 
and

other policy changes to address the 
academic achievement gap that has 
persisted along racial, ethnic, and in-
come levels of students of color and 
low-income students compared to their 
higher income and White peers. 
To meet this expansive charge, the 
commission 
included 
stakeholders 
from across our State, including rep-
resentatives of the Maryland General 
Assembly, including our now speaker 
of the Maryland House Delegates and 
our now State Senate president, the 
Governor’s office, county elected lead-
ers, education leaders, including State 
and local school board representatives, 
our State and local superintendents, 
leader of our State’s public university 
system, teachers, business leaders, and 
leading education advocacy organiza-
tions, such as the Maryland State Edu-
cation Association, Maryland Parent 
Teacher Association, and Maryland 
Family Network. 
In addition to the members of the 
commission, the commission actively 
sought input from the public with nu-
merous meetings soliciting public com-
ment held across our State. In January 
2019, the commission unanimously re-
leased their interim report that found 
Maryland students scored in the middle 
of the pack on the National Assess-
ment of Educational Progress, known 
as the ‘‘Nation’s report card,’’ which is 
given to representative samples of 4th, 
8th, and 12th graders in every State. 
The gaps in achievement between so-
cioeconomic, racial, and children with 
disabilities were far too large in a 
State like Maryland that has com-
mitted resources and established poli-
cies that are meant to provide a world- 
class public education system. 
The commission also reported that 
less than half of kindergartners enter-
ing our school system were ready to 
learn, and fewer than 40 percent of stu-
dents who are graduating from high 
school truly are ‘‘college or career 
ready.’’ This is in spite of the esti-
mates that by 2022 nearly two-thirds of 
the jobs in Maryland will require at 
least postsecondary credentials, wheth-
er they be nationally recognized indus-
try certificates or 2-year or 4-year col-
lege degrees. 
For instance, in 2017, just under half 
of all students across Maryland high 
schools received a proficient score on 
their English 10 exam. That exam helps 
evaluate the students’ readiness for 
college or career. Disaggregated data 
shows the continued struggle to close 
academic achievement gaps among ra-
cial and socioeconomic groups. Along 
racial lines, 77 percent of Asian stu-
dents and 67 percent of White students 
were proficient. However, only 34 per-
cent of Hispanic students and 29 per-
cent 
of 
African-American 
students 
earned proficiency scores. 
The 
commission’s 
interim 
report 
highlighted 
that 
despite 
Maryland 
being ranked as one of the top five 
States with the highest household me-
dian income, a large number of Mary-
land students are living in poverty. 
Forty-three percent of Maryland stu-
dents are low income and eligible for 
free or reduced-price school meals, 
meaning that they come from families 
at or below 185 percent of the Federal 
poverty line. For every 10 public 
schools across our State, there is a 
concentration of poverty where enroll-
ment consists of at least 55 percent of 
students 
living 
in 
poverty. 
These 
schools are in all of our subdivisions 
except one. 
In 15 percent of Maryland schools, at 
least 80 percent of children are low in-
come. Students attending schools with 
a concentration of poverty receive less 
funding per pupil than other school dis-
tricts. For example, 53 percent of Afri-
can-American students attend schools 
with concentrations of poverty, while 
only 8 percent of White students attend 
these schools. 
The academic achievement gap be-
tween Maryland students with means 
and our low-income students is stark. 
On the English 10 exam, 62 percent of 
economically 
advantaged 
students 
earned a passing score, while 28 percent 
of those students who are on free and 
reduced-price meals were deemed pro-
ficient. These statistics are stark. We 
know we have a problem. We have to 
deal with it. 
The commission reported that these 
academic achievement disparities con-
tinued into college enrollment, with 
fewer students of color and low-income 
students enrolling in college than their 
higher income and White peers. 
We 
will 
find 
similar 
numbers 
throughout our Nation. We need to do 
something about this. Concerns about 
the state of education in Maryland was 
not limited to student performance. 
The commission’s interim report also 
found that students face a rotating car-
ousel of teachers throughout their time 
in schools. With the average salary for 
teachers in Maryland approximately 25 
percent less than professionals with 
comparable levels of education, it is 
difficult to attract to the profession. 
Sixty percent of our new teachers are 
recruited from outside our State each 
year. This is a common problem we 
have throughout the country. 
Once those individuals arrive in the 
classroom, 47 percent will leave by the 
start of their third year. The turnover 
is tremendous. It is salary issues. It is 
working conditions. It makes it dif-
ficult to get the true professionalism 
and commitments that we need in edu-
cation. This difficulty in recruiting in-
dividuals 
and 
the 
constant 
churn 
leaves Maryland students and local 
education systems facing shortages in 
critical need areas, such as special edu-
cation, language, and the STEM fields. 
In order to address these inequities 
in education, the commission unani-
mously agreed on a proposal with five 
transformative 
policy 
recommenda-
tions in their interim report that 
would provide significant, additional 
investments in Federal, State, and 
local funding and modify policies for 
Maryland’s prekindergarten through 
12th grade education system. 
The five main policy recommenda-
tions would first invest in high-quality 
early childhood education and care 
through a significant expansion of full- 
day preschool, to be free for all low-in-
come, 3- and 4-year-olds, so that chil-
dren have the opportunity to begin 
kindergarten ready to learn. 
Second is to invest in teachers and 
school leaders by elevating the stand-
ard and status of the teaching profes-
sion, including a performance-based ca-
reer ladder and salaries comparable to 
other fields with similar educational 
requirements. 
Third, it creates a world-class in-
structional 
system 
with 
an 
inter-
national benchmark curriculum that 
enables most students to achieve ‘‘col-
lege or career ready’’ status by the 10th 
grade and then pursue pathways to in-
clude early college, Advanced Place-
ment courses, or a rigorous technical 
education leading to industry-recog-
nized credentials and higher paid jobs. 
Fourth, it provides support to stu-
dents who need it the most, with broad 
and sustained support for schools serv-
ing high concentrations of poverty, 
with after-school and summer aca-
demic programs and student access to 
needed health and social services. 
Finally, it ensures excellence for all 
through an accountability oversight 
board that has the authority to ensure 
that transformative education system 
recommendations are successfully im-
plemented and produce the desired im-
provements in student achievement. 
These reforms would be implemented 
over a 10-year period, creating a sus-
tained and coordinated effort to trans-
form Maryland’s public education sys-
tem into a world-class system, ele-
vating the teaching profession, and 
eliminating educational inequities. An 
independent analysis conducted in No-
vember 2019 confirms that the cost to 
implement 
the 
commission’s 
rec-
ommendations will pay for themselves 
shortly after the 10-year implementa-
tion period. 
Last year, the Maryland General As-
sembly recognized that our children 
could not wait to implement the com-
mission’s recommendations and estab-
lished the Blueprint for Maryland’s Fu-
ture to lay the groundwork for the im-
plementation of the commission’s rec-
ommendations. 
Starting this year, the Blueprint for 
Maryland’s Future is assisting low-in-
come families’ access to expanded serv-
ices and early childhood education, in-
cluding free prekindergarten for 3- and 
4-year-olds from low-income families. 
The Blueprint for Maryland’s Future 
is assisting in the recruitment of new 
teachers to the profession through in-
creased teacher pay and career ladders 
for exiting teachers to help train the 
next generation. A newly established 
career readiness standard will allow 
Maryland high school students to suc-
ceed in dual-enrollment courses offered 
by local community colleges. 
The 
‘‘Blueprint’’

Mary-
land’s education formulas to better

target resources to students who need 
additional assistance, including chil-
dren with disabilities, English learners, 
and students in schools with high con-
centration of poverty. This is all done 
while increasing accountability to en-
sure that the additional investments 
are properly implemented and help our 
students succeed. 
That is the path that we are on. I 
agree with advocates and elected lead-
ers who understand our kids cannot 
wait 
for 
adoption 
of 
these 
rec-
ommendations at some point in the fu-
ture. We need to act now. We need to 
implement 
these 
recommendations 
now and view them as a national model 
for other States to aspire to. Without 
transformative change, we will con-
tinue to hope for significantly different 
results with only incremental changes, 
or we can be bold and change the fu-
ture of our children and our country 
and every child with the high-quality 
education skills training that they 
need to be successful and climb out of 
poverty. 
I reject the arguments from those 
who would claim that the recommenda-
tions are too costly to implement. 
Without the full implementation of the 
commission’s recommendations, we are 
failing in our primary goal in govern-
ment of providing a better future for 
our children, allowing them to slip be-
hind their national and international 
peers. 
These arguments also fail to see that 
the investments in our children can 
lead to a lifetime of reduced costs in 
public safety and healthcare costs, as 
children can grow and support them-
selves 
and 
their 
future 
families 
through the education they receive in 
public schools. These investments will 
pay back dividends in a stronger econ-
omy that will benefit all of us. 
I believe we should not allow States 
and local communities to make these 
transformative changes on their own. 
The Federal Government should be a 
strong Federal partner in ensuring ac-
countability and in addressing edu-
cational inequities for our children. 
That is why I introduced the TRUE 
EQUITY Act. This legislation, which is 
purposely modeled after the commis-
sion’s 
recommendation, 
establishes 
four new, supplemental Federal grant 
opportunities 
for 
State 
and 
local 
school districts that are committed to 
addressing educational inequities while 
holding States and local school dis-
tricts accountable for failing to prop-
erly support their students. 
In strengthening the Federal Govern-
ment’s commitment as a partner in 
education, the four new TRUE EQUITY 
grants would provide an additional $1 
of Federal funds for every $2 of State 
and local funds that are committed to 
education beyond their fiscal year 2019 
spending levels. 
State and local school districts that 
receive grants would be required to 
meet a maintenance of effort to ensure 
that the State and local educational 
spending is maintained and would not 
allow the Federal Government’s fund-
ing to backfill reductions in State and 
local 
commitments 
to 
educational 
funding. 
As a requirement to receiving one of 
the four new TRUE EQUITY grants, a 
State would be required to have an 
independent oversight board to ensure 
that the State and local districts would 
be meeting their State-designated edu-
cational equity goals, and the over-
sight board would have the ability to 
hold the State and local school dis-
tricts accountable for not meeting 
their targeted goals. 
These grants are flexible to allow 
local communities to meet their needs 
over a several-year period, whether it 
be through the establishment of a col-
lege and career readiness pathway to 
support a high school student’s dual 
enrollment at a local community col-
lege and provide a jump-start on col-
lege; additional funding to expand the 
number of early learning hubs in the 
State—in Maryland, these are known 
as Judy Centers—or training for teach-
ers on how to address the needs of our 
children with disabilities. 
As Congress begins to look at the 
next reauthorization of the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act, I urge 
my colleagues to listen to the voices of 
the Marylanders across our State who 
know that our kids can’t wait for the 
implementation of these recommenda-
tions and support the TRUE EQUITY 
Act. 
I congratulate the members of the 
commission 
who 
thoughtfully 
re-
searched and crafted this national 
model for States to be able to see 
transformative change and raise their 
educational systems to that of a world- 
class school system. We owe our chil-
dren nothing less than to provide them 
with the best possible outcome in our 
Nation’s public schools.

for certain international programs to off-
set the amounts appropriated in this bill to 
respond to the coronavirus outbreak) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing:

PROGRAMS.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of law, all amounts made 
available for fiscal year 2020 for the East- 
West Center under title I of the Department 
of State, Foreign Operations, and Related 
Programs Appropriations Act, 2020 (division 
G of Public Law 116–94), the Inter-American 
Foundation under title III of such Act, and 
educational and cultural exchange programs 
under title I of such Act that remain unobli-
gated as of the date of the enactment of this 
Act are rescinded. 
(b) PROPORTIONAL RESCISSIONS
OF OTHER 
UNOBLIGATED
DISCRETIONARY
APPROPRIA-
TIONS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided under 
paragraph (2), after rescinding the amounts 
required under subsection (a), the Director of 
the Office of Management and Budget shall 
rescind, 
on 
a 
proportional 
basis, 
such 
amounts as may be necessary to fully offset 
(in conjunction with the rescissions under 
subsection (a)) the amounts appropriated by 
this Act from the unobligated amounts ap-
propriated for fiscal year 2020 for— 
(A) the Economic Support Fund under 
chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.); and 
(B) the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development.

(A) global health programs under title III 
of the Department of State, Foreign Oper-
ations, and Related Programs Appropria-
tions Act, 2020 (division G of Public Law 116– 
94); or 
(B) assistance to Israel. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, my amend-
ment would pay for the emergency 
funds for the coronavirus. 
I think that we should not let fear or 
urgency cause us to lose our minds and 
cause us to act in an irresponsible fash-
ion. I, for one, have looked at foreign 
aid over the years as welfare that we 
send to other countries that really is 
not particularly in our best interests 
anyway. If you follow foreign aid 
through the years, what you will find is 
that it goes from middle-class folks in 
rich countries to rich people in poor 
countries. 
Frankly, 
people 
enrich 
themselves at our expense. They steal 
our money. The Mubarak family in 
Egypt is now worth billions of dollars, 
which it skimmed off the top. The his-
tory of this throughout the Third 
World is legion and is well known. 
My amendment would basically take 
the $8 billion from the welfare we give 
to foreign countries in order to pay for 
this. I see no reason we shouldn’t do 
this. I am not opposed to the emer-
gency funding, but I think that the 
emergency funding should be gotten 
from elsewhere in the budget and that 
this is the responsible way to act. 
Every day, people across the country 
are confronted with unexpected ex-
penses. We budget and we plan, but 
things happen. When they do, we adjust 
and plan accordingly. Sometimes we 
confront an expense that is not only 
unexpected but is urgent, and that is 
where we find ourselves today. We 
want to respond and make sure we are 
providing resources to our medical pro-
fessionals and researchers. That is im-
portant, and I fully support that, which 
is why we should use this moment to

S1517 
March 5, 2020 
ask ourselves whether it is really nec-
essary to keep spending on wasteful 
things. 
If we don’t consider this now, when 
will we ever consider this? 
We want an all-hands-on-deck re-
sponse, so we should be cutting out 
waste and moving those resources to 
something that is of more immediate 
concern. So, if the coronavirus is of im-
mediate concern—and I think it is— 
let’s address that situation now, but 
let’s do so by taking money from less 
urgent things and money that we are 
wasting overseas—money that is often 
stolen by Third-World dictators. That 
is exactly what I am proposing today. 
We have the money. We don’t need to 
borrow more money. We just have to 
start setting our own priorities. For 
example, we shouldn’t spend another 
dollar in developing a foreign economy 
this year. That spending should be 
stopped, and the money should be spent 
here to buy supplies, to help expedite 
research, and to support our commu-
nities. The funds I am proposing to 
keep at home have been used abroad 
for all kinds of unnecessary and waste-
ful things. I will give you a few exam-
ples. 
We send U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund 
kids from Pakistan to go to space camp 
in America. We spend money on com-
bating student truancy in the Phil-
ippines. We have been funding the Pe-
ruvian Green New Deal. We actually 
send money to help deported illegal im-
migrants start up businesses in El Sal-
vador. What business is it of the U.S. 
taxpayer to be funding small busi-
nesses in El Salvador for people who 
broke the law by trying to break into 
our country? It is insane. At this point 
in time, I think this money would be 
better 
spent 
on 
research 
on 
the 
coronavirus and on a response to this 
epidemic should it become worse in our 
country. 
The list doesn’t stop there. I don’t 
know why we can’t agree to spend this 
money on the coronavirus instead of 
spending it abroad. We spend over $50 
billion a year in Afghanistan—building 
their roads, building their schools, try-
ing to create a nation where there real-
ly is no nation. We need to spend that 
money here at home. Besides, it is the 
law. 
We have a law called pay-go, or pay 
as you go, which is supposed to require 
Congress to pay for new spending. It 
has been around for a couple of dec-
ades. Yet we have broken the law thou-
sands of times. What do they do? They 
see something they want. You know, 
they are kids in a candy store. They 
want to spend. They want to give you, 
give you, give you free money, so they 
just ignore the law. So what happens 
every year is that they exceed the pay- 
as-you-go, and they don’t do the thing 
they are supposed to do, which is to 
offset this with a spending cut. Then 
they just write a small, little note in 
there, reading they have agreed to ig-
nore the pay-go rules again. That is 
what will happen in this case. 
The other way they ignore the rules 
on pay-go is they declare things to be 
emergencies, so everything is an emer-
gency. They say: Well, what would we 
do if we didn’t have this—if it weren’t 
an emergency? 
We already spend billions of dollars 
and have spent billions of dollars over 
the years to prepare for epidemics. We 
fund the CDC, and we fund the NIH. 
There is a lot of money out there. 
Once again, I am not against giving 
additional money, but we should just 
make a decision. We should be mature 
people and say we are not just going to 
print up the money or borrow it from 
China but are going to take it, maybe, 
from something less necessary. 
When we don’t want to pay for new 
spending, we just simply waive these 
rules on pay-go. We declare the spend-
ing to be emergency, and we get around 
the requirement. That is how we got a 
$23 trillion debt. We actually borrow $2 
million every minute. 
People say: Well, we have to do some-
thing. People are running around, act-
ing crazy—we have to do something. 
Well, who is going to do something 
about the $23 trillion debt? 
Do we not have 5 minutes to take a 
vote? In 15 minutes, we will be taking 
this vote, and people could simply vote 
and say that we are not going to bor-
row more money and that we will take 
the money from somewhere else in the 
budget that is less pressing. 
Mark my words—there is no fiscal re-
sponsibility up here among either 
party. It will be a small minority of us 
who will say that this funding should 
be offset by taking it from somewhere 
else in the budget. 
In times of emergency, Congress 
scrambles to put together new spend-
ing, but we should be working just as 
hard to pay for the cost that comes 
with emergencies. 
Which is a higher priority—spending 
millions of dollars to stabilize the sup-
ply chain of medical supplies and treat-
ments here at home or spending mil-
lions on international arts festivals? 
Which is a higher priority—spending 
millions to train frontline medical pro-
fessionals here at home on how to limit 
exposure to the coronavirus or spend-
ing millions of dollars, if not billions of 
dollars, paving roads in Afghanistan? 
My amendment gives us a chance to set 
priorities. 
We can support our communities and 
give our medical system the resources 
its needs, and we can do it without add-
ing to the debt. That is the responsible 
way. My amendment would do exactly 
that, and I encourage the other Sen-
ators to consider fiscal responsibility. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know 
other Senators have already spoken on 
this, but I would hope Members would 
oppose the Paul amendment. 
The amendment would cut, among 
other things, $7.3 billion from the De-
partment of State and the USAID. It 
would decimate programs that fund the 
foreign policy priorities of both the ad-
ministration and the Congress. A cut of 
that size would be about two-thirds of 
the total funding appropriated for 
these purposes, some of which has al-
ready been spent. 
I remember when James Mattis was 
the Secretary of Defense. He is a man 
I admire for his work as a four-star 
general with the Marine Corps and as 
Defense Secretary. He is not a man 
who looked at the world or the needs of 
our military in an abstract fashion; he 
dealt with it every day. He came before 
our Committee on Appropriations and 
said: If you want to cut foreign aid, 
buy me more bullets. 
He made it very clear that there are 
areas in the world where what we do 
keeps us from having to go to combat. 
The Paul amendment would prac-
tically eliminate the remaining budget 
for programs to strengthen democracy, 
combat corruption, promote economic 
growth, improve water and sanitation, 
aid victims of war and natural disas-
ters, and support our allies and part-
ners in countless ways. 
The reason the State Department 
and USAID need supplemental funds is 
that the resources provided in fiscal 
year 2020 are not sufficient to meet the 
unanticipated public health, economic, 
and humanitarian challenges presented 
by the coronavirus. Yet the Paul 
amendment would cut billions from the 
same accounts for which additional re-
sources are needed. 
The funding for the programs that 
would be cut by the Paul amendment is 
how we make our presence felt around 
the world. It actually totals less than 1 
percent of the Federal budget. 
Senators of both parties—of both par-
ties—voted overwhelmingly to include 
this funding in the fiscal year 2020 
State, Foreign Operations appropria-
tions bill. 
In case anybody has forgotten when 
that was, that was just 3 months ago. 
The Paul amendment would also 
eliminate $475 million that Congress 
enacted less than 3 months ago for edu-
cational and cultural exchanges, in-
cluding $160 million for the Fulbright 
Program—so no more Fulbright Pro-
gram, no more International Visitors 
Program, no more exchange programs 
for young leaders in Africa, Southeast 
Asia, or Latin America. These pro-
grams enrich the lives of Americans 
and directly benefit the economies, in 
every State of the Union, and create 
lasting ties between U.S. and foreign 
communities, universities, and govern-
ments—but not if the Paul amendment 
passes. 
The amendment would eliminate all 
funding for the Inter-American Foun-
dation, which, with a budget of just $37 
million, supports hundreds of projects 
to combat poverty in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. 
It would eliminate funding for the 
East-West Center, which has a long his-
tory of strengthening relations and 
building understanding between the

United States and the Asia/Pacific 
countries. 
Both the Inter-American Foundation 
and the East-West Center were estab-
lished by acts of Congress. It is in our 
national interest to fight poverty in 
Latin America and support engage-
ment with countries in the Far East. 
The coronavirus represents a serious 
public health threat. We have to re-
spond now. We have to treat this as the 
emergency it is. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that a letter from the U.S. Global 
Leadership Coalition, addressed to Sen-
ator GRAHAM and myself—incidentally, 
they represent more than 500 U.S. busi-
ness and nongovernmental organiza-
tions—opposing this amendment be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
COALITION, 
March 5, 2020. 
Hon. LINDSEY GRAHAM, 
Chairman, Subcommittee on State-Foreign Oper-
ations, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. 
Senate, Washington, DC. 
Hon. PATRICK LEAHY, 
Ranking Member, Subcommittee on State-For-
eign Operations, Committee on Appropria-
tions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRAHAM
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER LEAHY: On behalf of the more than 
500 business and NGO members of the U.S. 
Global Leadership Coalition (USGLC), in-
cluding business, military, and faith-based 
leaders in all 50 states, I write in strong op-
position to an amendment proposed by Sen-
ator Rand Paul that would offset emergency 
funding to address the growing coronavirus 
threat by canceling over $8 billion in con-
gressionally approved funds for the Inter-
national Affairs Budget. 
If enacted, this amendment would cancel 
critical 
funding 
for 
State 
Department, 
USAID, and other development programs 
around the world, undermining our national 
security and economic interests and placing 
America’s global leadership at risk. Cuts of 
this magnitude would have devastating con-
sequences on our ability to confront unprece-
dented global challenges—including coun-
tering China’s growing influence around the 
world, supporting partners in the fight 
against extremism, and addressing the im-
pacts of the Venezuelan refugee crisis on key 
allies like Colombia. 
There is a strong bipartisan legacy in the 
Senate of rejecting deep and dangerous cuts 
to America’s development and diplomacy 
programs. I urge the Senate to once again 
take decisive action and reject Senator 
Paul’s shortsighted amendment. Doing so 
will ensure that resources already approved 
by Congress can be fully deployed to support 
cost-effective programs that advance Amer-
ica’s interests. 
Thank you for your unwavering support of 
America’s international affairs programs and 
your commitment to strengthening the crit-
ical resources needed to advance America’s 
global leadership. 
Sincerely, 
LIZ SCHRAYER, 
President & CEO, USGLC.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

p.m. shall be equally divided between 
the leaders or their designees. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to speak about the 
ongoing crisis of the novel coronavirus 
outbreak and to urge all of us to pass 
this supplemental as quickly as pos-
sible. 
As of this morning, there are 163 con-
firmed cases in 17 States across the 
country, but no State has been more 
hard hit than the State of Washington. 
We now have 39 confirmed cases of 
COVID–19 and more than 230 people 
under public health monitoring. We 
have lost 10 of our citizens. Our 
thoughts and prayers are with those 
families who have lost loved ones, and 
there are still families who have loved 
ones in nursing homes and who are try-
ing to make sure they get the appro-
priate care in this ongoing crisis. 
I would also like to thank the work-
ers who are on the frontlines of this 
healthcare crisis and are doing every-
thing they can to help keep our citi-
zens safe. 
What is clear in this supplemental is 
that we need more resources for test-
ing. The testing capabilities will help 
our communities understand the com-
munity transfer of this virus and what 
else we need to do to help stop its 
spread. 
Some of the funding in this supple-
mental can be helpful for our smaller 
public labs to do more testing to help 
our public health officials respond to 
this crisis, and, as I urged yesterday, 
for the CDC and others to make it clear 
through our public health sites exactly 
how the public can go about getting ac-
cess to testing. 
This is so critical because I know 
there are people in the State of Wash-
ington who feel ill, who feel they might 
be subject to this coronavirus and 
aren’t getting tested. We want to make 
sure the public clearly understands 
what their paths are for getting those 
tests, and we want to make sure that 
every lab—commercial and academic— 
in the United States is getting pre-
pared to help us in the advent of the 
spread of this virus. Why? Because 
helping to identify these early cases is 
what will help us be successful in un-
derstanding these patterns and further 
the community separations that we 
need to do. 
Why is this so important? Well, 
today in the State of Washington, they 
are taking major steps. Major employ-
ers are encouraging their employees, if 
possible, to work from home. These are 
companies 
like 
Microsoft 
and 
Facebook and Amazon—major employ-
ers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1519 
March 5, 2020 
We have 23 schools that have closed 
and 2 school districts that are entirely 
shut down. Why are they doing this? 
Because they are taking precautions 
for people who have been exposed to 
the coronavirus in those schools, and 
they are doing everything they can to 
make sure that they respond correctly. 
In addition, King County has rec-
ommended that anyone over the age of 
60, anyone with a preexisting medical 
condition, or anyone who is pregnant 
should avoid public places and gath-
erings as much as possible. 
We are taking all these steps now be-
cause we are at the epicenter of this 
crisis, but I want people to know that 
there are other things that other 
States can be doing to learn from what 
we have done in Washington. 
The fact is that we had a flu lab that 
actually was a collaboration among 
our academic and scientific and health 
communities 
to 
get 
people 
who 
thought they simply had the flu to also 
be tested, and we found cases of the 
coronavirus. That actually is some-
thing you have to set up and get per-
mission for. I hope that every State 
will follow suit and set up such a co-
hort of people working together to 
share that information so that we can 
help prevent the spread. 
Washington State will receive $11.5 
million in funding to help the Depart-
ment of Health respond to this crisis. I 
know the Vice President is visiting our 
Governor in Olympia, WA, today. I 
hope these funds in this bill we are 
passing today will increase access for 
public lab testing, help pay for isola-
tion and quarantine, help pay for sani-
tizing in public areas, better track the 
areas and those who might come into 
contact with it, help labs that are try-
ing to identify hot spots, and limit ex-
posure. 
As part of this package, Washington 
State will also be helped with reim-
bursements since the outbreak of this 
virus—and I can tell you that they are 
many—and to help us push through the 
protocols that would help us establish 
better responses. 
Yesterday, we had a hearing in the 
Aviation Subcommittee to talk about 
what is needed for an aviation pro-
tocol. I know that some airlines in our 
State are doing everything possible to 
clean planes on every turn of the trip 
and to do deep cleaning. They are com-
municating—and we have encouraged 
them 
to 
communicate 
more—with 
their passengers exactly what they are 
doing to help with the mitigation of 
this virus. But that is not a substitute 
for the Department of Transportation, 
federally, 
and 
the 
CDC, 
collabo-
ratively, to work in giving guidance to 
airlines on what standards they should 
be meeting to help mitigate the spread 
of this virus. 
My colleagues and I are calling on 
them to do that, not simply to think of 
this as other agencies’ responsibilities 
but to work collaboratively to get this 
done. 
I want to thank the Appropriations 
Committee for getting this legislation 
to us today and all of our colleagues 
who have worked so quickly on making 
it happen. I can tell you that we need 
these funds; we need them now; and we 
need other States to heed the early 
testing that would have been helpful in 
our State and now may be helpful in 
yours. 
Let’s get as aggressive about testing 
as possible. Let’s get aggressive about 
sharing information about the flu and 
tracking this virus. Let’s get aggres-
sive about trying to mitigate the im-
pacts of this deadly disease. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, a 
new study showed that from the years 
2007 to 2018, prices for, actually, hun-
dreds of drugs rose many times—many 
times faster than the rate of inflation. 
List prices on 602 medicines rose by 159 
percent. That would average out to 9 
percent annually. After discounts and 
rebates, net prices increased by 60 per-
cent or 4.5 percent annually. That is 3.5 
times the rate of inflation. 
These are drugs for multiple scle-
rosis, cholesterol, rheumatoid arthri-
tis, chemotherapy, diabetes, and many 
other debilitating and life-threatening 
conditions. Put into real terms, these 
price increases mean that if one of 
these drugs cost $100 a month in 2007, 
that same drug would cost $259 in 2018. 
Meanwhile, you have to consider the 
working American. Wages for the aver-
age American over the same time pe-
riod increased about 30 percent in the 
private 
sector. 
That 
means 
wage 
growth is about half the rate of the 
growth of prescription drug prices, 
even after the rebates and even after 
the discounts. 
For many, increased drug costs are 
wiping out progress that these workers 
are making in their wages. Some fami-
lies are even going backward finan-
cially after paying for their prescrip-
tions. This doesn’t take into account 
at all the many other increases in the 
cost of living from college to housing, 
to insurance. 
Now, we Americans are surely fortu-
nate, aren’t we, to see the significant 
wage growth that we have had in this 
country for our workers under Presi-
dent Trump—great progress. 
The President and Republicans in 
Congress can rightly take credit for 
the country’s booming economy, but 
all that wage growth doesn’t mean 
much—or at least as much—if it is 
spent on the same prescription drug re-
fills every month. That is something 
that ought to concern every Member of 
this Congress, and for most, I am sure 
it does because we hear about it con-
stantly from our constituents. In fact, 
during this election season, polls show 
that it is one of the top three or four 
issues that are most on people’s minds. 
Let me be clear. These price hikes 
aren’t because the medicines got better 
or there was a significant increase in 
research and development. No, this is 
because the pharmaceutical companies 
could do it, and in doing it, they could 
get away with it because, in many 
cases, consumers don’t have a choice; 
consumers don’t have options or alter-
natives. That is because we don’t have 
a healthy marketplace that drives 
costs down for pharmaceuticals. 
Right now, pharmaceutical compa-
nies can essentially charge Medicare 
whatever they want, and taxpayers 
don’t have much recourse. Right now, 
every single working American who 
pays Federal taxes is subsidizing Big 
Pharma’s record profits through the 
drugs that the Federal Government 
pays for through various programs like 
Medicare and Medicaid. 
Now, there has to be a solution for 
this situation, and Ranking Member 
WYDEN and I are working to put some 
common sense back into this whole 
system of buying pills. In the Finance 
Committee, we have passed bipartisan 
legislation to put an end to unlimited 
corporate welfare for Big Pharma. The 
vote of that bill out of committee was 
19 to 9—a bipartisan effort. 
We are closer than ever to lowering 
drug prices for tens of millions of 
Americans, and these Americans have 
been crying for this help from Congress 
for quite a few years. But here we are. 
Big Pharma and its paid allies are out 
in force trying to kill any reforms that 
might endanger their profit margins. 
They are using scare tactics, deploying 
terms like ‘‘socialism’’ and ‘‘price con-
trols,’’ as if these subsidies to Big 
Pharma are not a form of socialism. 
I have been around long enough to 
recognize the political games that are 
being played now. You see it quite reg-
ularly on the television advertise-
ments. So let’s set the record straight. 
The last thing Big Pharma wants is a 
free market. After all, these were the 
same folks who loved ObamaCare so 
much because they knew it mandated 
another revenue stream for their prod-
ucts. Now, we all know how ObamaCare 
has turned out. Yet they made a deal 
with the White House to back that bill. 
Now, Big Pharma is also warning 
that any reforms would hurt research 
and development. In fact, my bipar-
tisan legislation with Senator WYDEN 
would result in less socialism, a more 
competitive marketplace, and wouldn’t 
put a damper on innovation. That is 
according to something that I call 
‘‘God’’ around here—the independent 
Congressional Budget Office. These are 
professional people making these judg-
ments. They judge most all of our leg-
islation, particularly if there is a mon-
etary cost to it. 
For those who may not believe a poli-
tician, let me point to the work, then,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1520 
March 5, 2020 
that the professionals at CBO have 
done on Grassley-Wyden: 
First, the updated Grassley-Wyden 
bill will save more than $80 billion and 
result in no fewer cures. 
No. 2, CBO says it will reduce patient 
out-of-pocket spending in Part D of 
Medicare by around $50 billion. 
No. 3, CBO says it will reduce pre-
miums by about $1 billion for tens of 
millions of seniors and Americans with 
disabilities on Medicare. 
No. 4, CBO says that is all on top of 
out-of-pocket expenses that we put a 
cap on and an end to the dreaded 
doughnut hole that has been part of 
Part D since 2003. 
No. 5, we have also, according to the 
Congressional Budget Office, created a 
new way to spread out payments for 
those out-of-pocket expenses so that 
paying the bills every month becomes a 
bit easier for those on fixed incomes. 
No. 6 and lastly, according to the 
Congressional Budget Office, the bipar-
tisan Prescription Drug Pricing Reduc-
tion Act—that is the title of our bill— 
would protect taxpayers from being put 
on the hook for unlimited price hikes 
that have no basis in a functioning free 
market. 
So, without reforms, big pharma-
ceutical companies will continue to re-
ceive tens of billions of dollars in ex-
cess taxpayer subsidies, and they will 
also have no incentive to keep prices 
from rising many times faster than in-
flation. 
Currently, prescription drug manu-
facturers can charge Medicare more 
and more every year, and they do. 
When the government is paying and 
you have entitlement programs, tax-
payers are forced to foot the bill. So 
Grassley-Wyden enacts accountability 
and ends corporate welfare without 
harming medical innovations. 
Now, Senator WYDEN and I are look-
ing forward to reintroducing our bipar-
tisan bill very soon. So far, a dozen 
Senate Republicans have announced 
publicly that they support this bipar-
tisan bill. Others will announce their 
support in the coming days, and a 
dozen more Republican Senators have 
indicated to me that Grassley-Wyden is 
going in the right direction, implying 
that they would vote for it on the Sen-
ate floor. So I am optimistic that we 
will continue to gain support as Sen-
ators learn more. 
I was really pleased with President 
Trump announcing his willingness to 
sign a bill in his State of the Union 
message. The next morning, Vice Presi-
dent PENCE was on cable TV saying 
that 
he 
supported 
Grassley-Wyden. 
Secretary Azar has endorsed the bill. 
Not only that, but Secretary Azar and 
a gang of people in domestic policy at 
the White House have been working 
with us on this legislation, even prior 
to its coming out of committee. 
So, with all of this work and with all 
of this support—and with the interest 
on the part of the voters as being one 
of the three or four most prominent 
issues that will determine how people 
vote—it seems to me it deserves a vote 
on the Senate floor and very soon. So I 
am here today to urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle, if they have 
any questions about this bill, to visit 
with me about it and learn how it will 
help all of our constituents. 
The six points I made about the bill 
based upon what the Congressional 
Budget Office said about it isn’t all 
that that bill does. There is a lot more 
to it. 
Maybe I had better back up. I have 
read enough comments of my col-
leagues—colleagues 
I 
haven’t 
even 
talked to—that said what an important 
issue this is. So, in one way or another, 
without even signing on to this bill, 
without even being on the Finance

pledged to lower prescription drug 
prices. So I think we should follow 
through on that pledge.

TRIBUTE TO RONNIE ANDERSON 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
want to spend a few minutes talking 
about a friend of mine from Louisiana 
who is a fine American and a fine Lou-
isianian, and he is retiring. His name is 
Ronnie Anderson. 
I want to celebrate his 51 years of 
service. That number is correct. I know 
some of our pages here can’t imagine 
someone being in a single job for 51 
years, but Ronnie has served 51 years, 
and he has devoted those years, in 
large part, in service to our State’s 
Farm Bureau. 
He has led the Louisiana Farm Bu-
reau to greater influence, to growing 
membership, and that is not a small 
feat, because America was born on a 
farm. In some respects, Louisiana was 
born on a farm, and farming is, as you 
well know, Madam President, a chal-
lenging yet very rewarding vocation 
and profession. 
For 31 of the last 31 elections, the 
Louisiana Farm Bureau members have 
chosen Ronnie as their president. So he 
has won 31 elections in a row by our 
farmers in Louisiana, which is almost 
as good as the President’s electoral 
record. 
Farmers from East Carroll, in my 
State, to Beauregard Parishes and else-
where in between have come to trust 
Ronnie as someone who knows them, 
who cares about them, who cares about 
their farms, and who was willing to 
rack up 71,000 miles driving his truck 
across the State of Louisiana in an ef-
fort to win their confidence, as Ronnie 
did repeatedly. 
Ronnie spent most of his 71 years on 
this Earth working alongside the farm-
ers whom he represents. He grew up 
caring for dairy cows in East Feliciana 
Parish. In Louisiana, as you may know, 
we call our counties parishes. 
Along with Ronnie’s wife, Vivian, 
Ronnie still produces horses, hay, beef 
cattle, and timber. All the while he was 
doing this, he helped widen the arms of 
the Louisiana Farm Bureau and double 
its 
membership 
to 
nearly 
150,000 
women and men over the course of 
Ronnie’s three decades as the organiza-
tion’s president. 
Louisiana is a very diverse agricul-
tural State, where each region is dis-
tinct, and Ronnie has represented 
every nook and every cranny of our 
farming and ranching community. 
I am not alone in standing in awe of 
Ronnie Anderson’s service. I am in 
awe, and I wish Ronnie and Vivian, in 
their next chapter, the chance to enjoy 
life. I know they have both enjoyed the 
51 years of service to the Farm Bureau, 
but now will enjoy life in a different 
way. 
I wanted to come here today and cel-
ebrate Ronnie’s service and that of 
Vivian’s, his life partner, as well. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 6074 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, we face 
a serious global crisis today with the 
spread of the coronavirus. We all know 
that. The American people, I believe, 
expect us here in the U.S. Senate to set 
aside politics and set into motion a 
swift and sweeping response to this 
danger. Yesterday was a big step in 
that direction. 
I and Vice Chairman LEAHY, who is 
on the floor here with me, in conjunc-
tion with the leaders on both sides and 
with our House counterparts, intro-
duced a comprehensive plan that pro-
vides our experts and agencies on the 
frontlines with the resources they tell 
us they need to combat this crisis. 
The package we introduced includes 
$7.8 billion in discretionary appropria-
tions for the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, the National In-
stitutes of Health, the Food and Drug 
Administration, the State Department, 
the USAID, and the Small Business Ad-
ministration. The package also author-
izes an additional $500 million in man-
datory spending for telehealth through 
Medicare. Combined, this emergency 
supplemental provides $8.3 billion in 
resources to attack the crisis at the 
local, State, Federal, and international 
levels. 
In situations like this, I believe no 
expense should be spared to protect the 
American people, and in crafting this 
package, none was. It is an aggressive 
plan, a vigorous plan, that has received 
an overwhelming positive reaction in 
the House and in the marketplace. It is

the Senate’s responsibility today to 
keep the momentum going. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes and 
demonstrate to the American people 
that we here in the Senate are unified 
and have their backs on this crisis. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I agree 
with what Chairman SHELBY has said. 
We have tried to set an example. The 
two of us are from two different par-
ties, from two different parts of the 
country and, I think it is fair to say, 
have two different political philoso-
phies. Yet we have come together on 
this, as we have on so many other 
issues on appropriations, to show, as an 
example to our colleagues, what we 
think is best on this bill. 
This week, Congress showed strong, 
decisive leadership in addressing the 
novel coronavirus. As appropriators of 
both parties often do, and as Members 
of Congress have proven still capable of 
doing even in the most partisan of 
times, we have put our labels aside and 
have come together for the American 
people. 
I was concerned that this was some-
thing the President was not doing. We 
saw the President spread misinforma-
tion 
on 
national 
television 
that 
downplayed the potential risk to the 
American people. I was concerned that 
he was worried more about the market 
impacts than about human lives. His 
administration’s initial proposal for 
$1.25 billion of new spending, plus the 
authority to divert $1.25 billion from 
such things as Ebola prevention and 
low-income heating assistance, was 
reckless and devoid of substance. 
Those in the administration sought 
vague transfer authorities to allow 
them to move other money around in 
unidentified ways. It showed how little 
thought was given to what was needed 
and to how much was needed. I thought 
it was the latest attempt to undermine 
Congress’s power of the purse—the 
power of the purse that Republicans 
and Democrats have always tried to 
protect. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD at the end of my 
remarks a letter from Russell T. 
Vought, Acting Director of the Office 
of Management and Budget. 
I asked to submit the acting OMB Di-
rector’s request letter as an example of 
what not do in an emerging crisis. 
Fortunately, there are those who re-
main in our government who are very 
forthcoming with me and with our bi-
partisan staff members—my staff and 
Senator SHELBY’s staff—about the real 
needs of confronting the coronavirus, 
needs that are based on facts and 
science. I do thank the staffs at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, the National Institutes of 
Health, the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary for Preparedness and Response, 
and the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary for Financial Resources. Their 
help was invaluable in producing in 
only 9 days the package we are going 
to be voting on today. During those 9 
days, there was a lot of evening and 
weekend work by our staffs and by the 
Senators involved. We did it in 9 days 
because of the emergency, and their 
help was invaluable. 
The crisis is real. Worldwide, there 
are now 92,000 confirmed cases and 3,200 
confirmed deaths. Here in our country, 
that number is rising as there have 
been more than 150 confirmed cases and 
11 deaths. The CDC has told us that the 
public health system will be able to 
test up to 75,000 people by the end of 
the week and that we should expect the 
number of cases here to rise. So I 
strongly support this $7.8 billion pack-
age and the other money that is avail-
able. 
This package is going to provide 
nearly $1 billion directly to State, 
local, and Tribal governments to sup-
port public health preparedness and re-
sponse; over $3 billion in the research 
and development of vaccines, thera-
peutics, and diagnostics; nearly $1 bil-
lion for healthcare preparedness, phar-
maceuticals, 
medical 
supplies, 
and 
community health; $1.25 billion to sup-
port our needed response overseas; $7 
billion in low-interest loans for small 
businesses; and nearly $500 million to 
enhance the availability of telehealth 
services across the country. This is, 
certainly, something very important to 
those who might have rural areas in 
their States, and, frankly, we all do. 
The American people are looking for 
leadership, and they want assurance 
that their government is up to the task 
of protecting their health and safety. I 
think we have to provide this leader-
ship. 
I am pleased that Congress included 
language in the bill—supported by both 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats—that 
specifies that the funds can only be 
used to prevent, prepare for, and re-
spond to the coronavirus. If there is a 
cynical effort, for any reason, by the 
President to shift funds from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention, or 
the 
Public 
Health 
Social 
Services 
Emergency Fund, which are the agen-
cies at the epicenter of this crisis—to 
divert funds, for example, to activities 
along the southwest border—it will vio-
late the law. 
As I have said several times on this 
floor, I thank Chairman SHELBY and 
his staff, as well as the majority and 
Democratic leaders, for their coopera-
tion. 
I will submit a list of committee 
staffers who worked through weekends 
and late into the nights to make this 
possible. It is a long list, but it shows 
some of the most professional people 
we have working in the Senate. I know 
that Senator SHELBY has a similar list 
from his office. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD the list of the 
committee staffers’ names. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

EXECUTIVE
OFFICE
OF
THE
PRESI-
DENT, OFFICE
OF
MANAGEMENT 
AND BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, February 24, 2020. 
Hon. MICHAEL R. PENCE, 
President of the Senate, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. PRESIDENT: In late December 
2019, China identified a novel coronavirus 
which was causing human-to-human trans-
mission and has subsequently been named 
COVID–19. On January 30, 2020, the World 
Health Organization declared a public health 
emergency of international concern due to 
widespread transmission of the virus. As of 
February 23, 2020, there are 78,811 confirmed 
cases of COVID–19 in approximately 30 coun-
tries worldwide; the total number of COVID– 
19 related deaths is now over 2,500 people, the 
majority of which are in China. In the 
United States, there have been 14 confirmed 
cases of COVID–19 presenting in seven states 
(not including 39 persons repatriated to the 
United States who have tested positive). 
The President’s priority is protecting the 
homeland, and the Administration is work-
ing aggressively to minimize the risk of the 
virus spreading in the United States. The 
President has created a Coronavirus Task 
Force to direct the U.S. response. This Task 
Force is led by the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services (HHS) and is composed of 
subject matter experts from across Govern-
ment, including some of the Nation’s fore-
most experts on infectious diseases. On Jan-
uary 31, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared 
a public health emergency. HHS has tapped 
into the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention’s (CDC) Infectious Diseases Rapid 
Response Reserve Fund to help combat the 
virus. In addition, fiscal year (FY) 2020 funds 
are being re-prioritized across HHS as nec-
essary to address the virus. 
The Government has taken unprecedented 
steps to minimize the risk of travelers 
spreading COVID–19 to the United States. 
The President suspended entry into the 
United States of certain foreign nationals 
who have recently traveled to China and who 
pose a risk of transmitting the virus and di-
rected inbound flights from China to 11 air-
ports where enhanced screening now takes 
place. 
The Government has conducted numerous 
charter flights to evacuate American citi-
zens from Wuhan, in the Hubei Province, 
China and the cruise ship Diamond Princess 
back to the United States. All passengers 
were screened for symptoms before the 
flights, and medical professionals continue 
to monitor the health of all returning pas-
sengers. 
At the direction of the President and under 
the auspices of the Task Force, several Fed-
eral agencies are contributing significant re-
sources and personnel to support the domes-
tic and international response. To this point, 
no agency has been inhibited in response ef-
forts due to resources or authorities. How-
ever, much is still unknown about this virus 
and the disease it causes. The Administra-
tion believes additional Federal resources 
are necessary to take steps to prepare for a 
potential worsening of the situation in the 
United States, and requests an appropriation 
of $1.25 billion of emergency funding in the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1522 
March 5, 2020 
Public Health and Social Services Emer-
gency Fund at HHS to continue supporting 
critical response and preparedness activities. 
In addition, the Administration is requesting 
that the Congress permit the $535 million in 
emergency 
supplemental 
funding 
appro-
priated in the Agriculture, Rural Develop-
ment, Food and Drug Administration, and 
Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2020, 
to the Public Health and Social Services 
Emergency Fund at HHS for the prevention 
and treatment of Ebola to be used for 
COVID–19 response. Tremendous progress has 
been made on Ebola and the current national 
response priority should be COVID–19. These 
two proposals would make $1.8 billion in new 
resources available for the current response. 
This funding would support all aspects of 
the U.S. response, including: public health 
preparedness and response efforts; public 
health surveillance, epidemiology, labora-
tory testing, and quarantining costs; ad-
vanced research and development of new vac-
cines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; ad-
vanced manufacturing enhancements; and 
the Strategic National Stockpile. Funds 
would also be made available, as necessary, 
to affected States that are making contribu-
tions to the current national response. 
Because this funding arises from an unfore-
seen, unanticipated event and is necessary 
for the protection of human life, these sup-
plemental resources should be designated as 
emergency funding. In addition to these 
emergency supplemental appropriations, the 
Administration is seeking enhanced authori-
ties to use existing resources most effec-
tively and to create additional flexibility for 
directing resources toward the response. 
These flexibilities include the ability for 
HHS to transfer funds to CDC, the National 
Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration, the Assistant Secretary for 
Preparedness and Response, and other com-
ponents as necessary to carry out further re-
sponse activities. This also includes en-
hanced transfer authority for the Secretary 
for the COVID–19 response, similar to the au-
thority already provided for the HHS Ref-
ugee and Entrant Assistance account. In ad-
dition, the Administration seeks an increase 
of the authorized funding level, to $10 mil-
lion, for the repatriation program within the 
Administration for Children and Families for 
potential or future response activities. 
With the appropriation of new emergency 
funding, as well as the repurposing of FY 2020 
Ebola resources, reprioritization of other FY 
2020 funding across HHS, and contributions 
from other Government agencies, across the 
Government we expect to allocate at least 
$2.5 billion in total resources for COVID–19 
response efforts. 
Thank you for your consideration of these 
funding needs. I urge the Congress to take 
swift action to provide the additional fund-
ing requested to support the United States 
response to COVID–19. I stand ready to work 
with you to achieve this goal.

RUSSELL T. VOUGHT,

(Purpose: To establish greater energy

building codes.) 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to call up amend-
ment No. 1514 and ask that it be re-
ported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Ohio [Mr. PORTMAN] pro-
poses an amendment numbered 1514. 
(The amendment is printed in today’s 
RECORD under ‘‘Text of Amendments.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, Sen-
ator SHAHEEN and I are here today to 
report this amendment. This is simply 
language that is being reinserted back 
into the Energy bill that was taken 
out. I will say that it is clarifying lan-
guage. We made some slight changes to 
clarify that there are no mandates in 
this legislation, and it has to do with 
ensuring that we have encouragement 
of energy efficiency in the single larg-
est use of energy in our country, which 
are our residential homes and commer-
cial buildings. So I appreciate the fact 
that Senator SHAHEEN is here on the 
floor. I yield to the Senator. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, Sen-
ator PORTMAN and I have been working 
on this legislation for about 10 years 
now. It has gone through committee 
multiple times. It has gone through the 
floor of the Senate multiple times, and 
we hope that we have it in a position 
now where we can actually get this 
done as part of the overall energy 
package, which is significant and a 
tribute to the work of Senators MUR-
KOWSKI and MANCHIN and so many peo-
ple in this Chamber. 
As Senator PORTMAN said, energy use 
in buildings is about 40 percent of our 
energy use. It is the biggest single sec-
tor in our economy. Energy efficiency 
is the cheapest, fastest way to deal 
with our energy needs. So what these 
provisions would do—they are vol-
untary. What they would do is provide 
significant savings to consumers. They 
would be the equivalent of taking 
every car and light truck off the road 
for a year, so significant emission sav-
ings and significant energy savings. 
This is a win-win. I hope that the 
amendment can be called up and 
passed. 
Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my col-
league, and I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON, FRANK 
JOHNSON, ETHAN CAMILLE, AND TREY CAMILLE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday afternoon, and it is the time 
I love to come down to the floor. It is 
one of my favorite times of the week

S1583 
March 5, 2020 
because I get to talk about an Alaskan 
who has done something really, really 
important for their community, for 
their State, and for their country. I 
know the pages like the speech because 
I talk about stories in Alaska—the 
great State of Alaska and what is hap-
pening in the State right now. Some-
times I call this person the Alaskan of 
the Week. Usually, it is one person. 
Sometimes we fudge a little and recog-
nize more than one person. Today we 
are going to recognize our Alaskans of 
the Week. 
In any case, these are people who 
help their communities, help their 
country, and oftentimes do something 
that is unheralded, nobody knows 
about, very few know about, so I like 
to come down and tell the country 
about what they are doing. As you 
know, Alaska is a big State. It holds a 
lot of imagination for our Nation—the 
last frontier, with good reason, because 
we are filled with resilient people, 
some who have lived in Alaska for 
thousands and thousands of years, 
building communities in some of the 
most extreme weather environments 
on the planet, and they are tough, my 
constituents. They are also kind, and 
they make it through our tough win-
ters. 
It is below zero in many, many parts 
of the State—well below zero. We make 
it 
through 
these 
winters 
through 
toughness, 
ingenuity, 
and, 
impor-
tantly, looking out for one another. 
Last week, I highlighted a heroic 
Coast Guard rescuer, Evan Grills, in a 
real epic story for those who listened 
to it—what this young scout swim-
mer—rescue swimmer did in his first 
mission ever in the Coast Guard, some-
thing that people should remember for 
a long, long time. 
This week, I am going to talk about 
another rescue mission—an only-in- 
Alaska mission—and I am going to rec-
ognize four extraordinary young Alas-
kans who stuck together, toughed it 
out, looked out for one another, and 
were rescued in another perilous situa-
tion. They are Christopher Johnson, 
age 14; Frank Johnson, age 8; Ethan 
Camille, age 7; and Trey Camille, 2 
years old. All of them are alive and re-
covering because of their own inge-
nuity, determination, toughness, and 
looking out for one another. These four 
boys are from Nunam Iqua, a Yupik 
village 495 miles northwest of Anchor-
age. 
Home to about 200 people, this village 
is a close-knit Yupik community on 
the south fork of the Yukon River. A 
2005 mission statement, written by 
community leaders and elders, de-
scribes the village like this: ‘‘a small 
quiet community of family, relatives, 
and friends working together [to pur-
sue] our Yupik way of lifestyle with re-
spect to our surrounding land and 
waters for subsistence.’’ 
Like many places in Alaska, tem-
peratures there can be extreme, as they 
would be on February 2, when these 
four boys were rambunctiously playing 
in the house. Irene, the grandmother of 
three and mother of one, was watching 
them that day. It was her birthday. As 
boys do, they were getting restless. 
They wanted to get outside. Irene, 
wanting to have them get some exer-
cise and play, rightly encouraged them 
to get outside in the great outdoors, 
but the weather was turning a little bit 
ugly. Storms were in the forecast. 
Irene later said: 
They have to know how to be outside. They 
are tough Alaskan kids. There’s always 
going to be a storm coming. Besides, their el-
ders and their grandfather taught them to be 
prepared for the weather. 
This is teaching from their grand-
parents and mothers and fathers. 
So 
the 
four 
boys—Christopher, 
Frank, Ethan, and Trey—trudged out-
side to partake in one of the most pop-
ular winter hobbies we have in Alaska, 
snowmachining. 
Snowmachining 
is 
often referred to as snowmobiling by 
many Americans, but I am going to 
call 
it 
by 
its 
proper 
name, 
snowmachining. Due to a lack of road 
systems in our State, it also happens 
to be a primary mode of transportation 
during the winter months across doz-
ens and dozens of villages throughout 
Alaska. 
After they went riding around the 
small village, the boys were going to 
call it a day, when they spotted a fox. 
They spotted a fox. Like curious young 
boys do, the irresistible urge to trace 
this fox began, and they chased it out 
onto the tundra. Before they knew it, 
they lost the fox. The snowmachine 
was now stuck in the snow, and they 
were lost in a white blizzard. They 
were lost. 
Chris, the 14-year-old—the oldest of 
the group, the leader—was determined 
to lift the snowmachine free of the 
snow. He lifted it so hard that it was 
later discovered he suffered a hernia. 
This is one tough kid. 
Eventually, the machine unfortu-
nately ran out of gas, and the young 
boys were miles and miles away from 
their village and lost. They began 
tracking through the deep snow in 
whiteout conditions in a direction they 
thought was the way back home. 
At one point, one of the boys briefly 
took off his glove, which the wind 
promptly took away in the storm. Yet 
they continued walking and walking 
into winds as high as 60 miles per hour 
and wind chills way, way below zero. 
After fighting the deep snow and 
whiteout conditions for 4 miles, Chris 
decided it was time to try to build a 
snow cave for shelter. That is a smart 
young man, knowing how to survive. 
They did it. They built a shelter out 
of snow—a hole for them to crawl into 
and escape some of these most brutal 
wind gusts. 
Now, a snow cave is only used as a 
last resort, but this was the last resort, 
and these young boys knew it. So they 
crawled in, and they huddled, and they 
waited for a rescue. 
Back in the village, as you can imag-
ine, the boys’ family was getting fran-
tic. They called out to the community 
to help search for them, and that is 
what people did. All throughout the 
community, they couldn’t be found. 
And then, as often happens in our 
State, the Coast Guard, the National 
Guard, and local search and rescue 
groups from neighboring villages were 
all activated—Alaskans throughout the 
State going to look for these four boys. 
It was all hands on deck. 
Irene and Karen, one of the mothers, 
of three of them, were heartsick. Hours 
and hours went by. The whole State 
was holding its breath. It had been over 
24 hours. The cold night fell. Around 2 
a.m., the search and rescue was called 
off. 
In the snow cave, however, these 
young, tough Alaskan boys continued 
to protect each other. Almost 20 miles 
away from home, they huddled. They 
tried to keep each other warm to keep 
each other alive. 
Ethan didn’t have a glove. Chris-
topher was only wearing sweatpants, 
and they were particularly concerned 
for the 2-year-old, Trey. First, one of 
them crawled on top of Trey, but they 
were afraid that might be too much for 
him, so they created a kind of criss-
cross barrier to keep this young 2-year- 
old alive and warm as best they could. 
The 8-year-old, Frank, refused to 
close his eyes throughout the night for 
fear of falling asleep and really never 
waking up. So he continuously stayed 
awake and poked the other boys 
throughout the night to keep them 
awake, which was successful. 
The next morning, the storm had 
cleared, the sun started to come up, 
and the search throughout the State, 
with all of these other Alaskans look-
ing for these four boys, continued. For 
hours and hours, the search team kept 
their eyes peeled for anything unusual 
on the tundra. 
About 1 hour before the sun was 
going to go down again the next day, 
the search party from Scammon Bay— 
about 50 miles south—saw something. 
They knew how to read the tundra. 
They knew what a snow drift would 
look like, and this one looked dif-
ferent. Then they saw movement. 
The search party investigated and 
came upon the four missing boys 
huddled and bundled together. Because 
it looked like one big mass, at first 
they didn’t think any of the boys were 
alive, and then they realized what was 
going on. They were protecting the 
baby. 
One of the rescuers, Herschel Sun-
down, told a reporter they were pro-
tecting Trey. The rescue team imme-
diately got to work warming the boys 
up, and within 15 minutes, a Coast 
Guard helicopter—our brave men and 
women of the Coast Guard, always on 
the scene—quickly transported these 
boys, after picking them up, to a local 
hospital. 
Ethan, the 7-year-old, is now recov-
ering from severe frostbite on his 
hands, but all the kids are back at 
school and doing well.

March 5, 2020 
The rescuer, Herschel Sundown said: 
[Honestly], I don’t know how they sur-
vived. The will to survive in these young 
boys is amazing. I have never seen anything 
like [it]. 
Irene, the grandmother of the three 
and mother of one, is so very proud of 
them. She said: If I were to get lost in 
Alaska in the wilderness, I would want 
to be with these four boys. So would I. 
She also asked for the prayers of the 
country for Ethan and for his hand to 
heal. And that is starting to happen. 
These are the kind of young men and 
boys in Alaska who make us so unique, 
tough, and resourceful. They uplift us, 
and they make us proud. They are the 
protectors of their lands, their homes, 
and, importantly, each other. 
To the rescue crews, thank you again 
for your hard work and perseverance 
and for risking your own lives for these 
young boys. 
To Christopher, Frank, Ethan, and 
little 2-year-old Trey, thank you for 
your inspiration, for your ingenuity, 
for your toughness, and for being able 
to survive in the elements and looking 
out for each other. Thank you for stay-
ing alive and staying safe, and con-
gratulations on being our Alaskans of 
the Week. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
first, I want to thank the Senator from 
Alaska for his ‘‘Alaskans of the Week’’ 
each week. I have had the opportunity 
to preside a few times when he recog-
nizes the Alaskan of the Week, and the 
stories are unbelievable. The story last 
week of what the young man from the 
great State of Florida did up in Alaska 
was just remarkable. 
So I say to the Senator, thank you 
for what you do. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Thank you. 
SECURE U.S. BASES ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I speak today in honor of the three vic-
tims of the tragic terrorist attack that 
took place at Naval Air Station Pensa-
cola on December 6, 2019. 
Airman Mohammed Sameh Haitham, 
known to friends and family as ‘‘Mo,’’ 
just 19 years old, from St. Petersburg, 
FL, was a great athlete who loved to 
make others laugh. 
Ensign Joshua Kaleb Watson of En-
terprise, AL, a 23-year-old natural-born 
leader and selfless volunteer, who lift-
ed others up, died a hero after giving 
first responders information on the 
shooter’s location while he was mor-
tally wounded. 
Airman Apprentice Cameron Scott 
Walters of Richmond Hill, GA, was just 
21 years old, with a contagious smile, 
whose dream was to serve his country. 
Our sailors and law enforcement offi-
cials showed heroism and bravery in 
the face of evil, as they ran toward the 
shooter that day, saving lives, and our 
first responders came to the first aid of 
those in need. 
Following this attack, I promised to 
do everything possible to prevent a 
tragedy 
like 
this 
from 
happening 
again. I called for a hard reset of the 
entire foreign national’s training pro-
gram and for all Saudi nationals train-
ing in the United States to be sent 
home until the U.S. Department of De-
fense completed a thorough review. 
We now know that 21 of the foreign 
military students were withdrawn from 
the program and returned to Saudi 
Arabia after an investigation found 
that they were engaged in dangerous 
activities, including accessing anti- 
American jihadists websites and child 
pornography. 
Withdrawing these students was a 
positive step, but there are still more 
than 850 military students from Saudi 
Arabia who remain in the United 
States at 38 military installations in 17 
States, and there are thousands of ad-
ditional foreign nationals from coun-
tries around the world training at U.S. 
military basis across our great Nation. 
I am not calling for an end to these 
programs. Our alliances around the 
world, including our longstanding rela-
tionship with Saudi Arabia, are invalu-
able in defending American national 
securities and our interests abroad. 
These programs play an important 
role, but we cannot put the lives of our 
military men and women at risk. 
We need to make sure that our men 
and women in uniform are safe at all 
times, especially when they are train-
ing right here in the United States. 
Today, I am proud to join with my 
colleague Senator JONI ERNST to intro-
duce the Secure U.S. Bases Act, to 
make sure these programs are operated 
with American interests first and that 
our men and women in uniform are 
protected. 
The Secure U.S. Bases Act does three 
things. First, it creates a new visa cat-
egory for foreign military students 
training on U.S. bases, with restric-
tions on their travel and actions while 
they are in our country. Individuals 
who receive the new visa will be pro-
hibited from possessing, acquiring, or 
using firearms, except for uses specifi-
cally required by their training pro-
gram, and they will be under the con-
tinual oversight of their commander. 
Second, the bill changes the applica-
tion process and vetting requirements 
for foreign military students. 
The application to train on U.S. 
bases will now require an official en-
dorsement letter from the chief of in-
telligence of their home country, addi-
tional personal information, an in-per-
son interview, and an extensive back-
ground check that will include a review 
of social media activity. The U.S. Di-
rector of National Intelligence will 
also be responsible for the final deci-
sion on whether to admit an applicant 
into this program. 
Finally, the Secretary of Defense 
must develop a method for classifying 
relative risks by country and consider 
the overall risk profile of each country 
when making determinations of an ap-
plicant’s eligibility. If a program could 
be implemented in another country in-
stead of the United States, the Depart-
ment should consider that when appro-
priate. 
This terrorist should have never been 
allowed into our country, let alone on 
any American military base with easy 
access to military men and women. 
The Secure U.S. Bases Act makes sure 
foreign military students training at 
U.S. bases are thoroughly vetted and 
monitored and that our troops are pro-
tected and never have to experience a 
tragedy like this again. 
I had the opportunity to serve in the 
U.S. Navy and can’t imagine our mili-
tary men and women feeling unsafe on 
their post. It is a place where they 
train and serve, where their families 
live—some on base and some off—and 
where they deserve to feel safe and se-
cure. 
I hope all my colleagues join me in 
this effort and keep our U.S. bases se-
cure. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
SUPREME COURT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day our colleague, the senior Senator 
from New York, headed across the 
street to join a pro-abortion rally out-
side 
the 
Supreme 
Court 
Building, 
where he made deeply disturbing com-
ments about two of the Justices sitting 
on the Supreme Court. He said these 
words: 
I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell 
you, Kavanaugh. You have released the 
whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You 
won’t know what hit you if you go forward 
with these awful decisions. 
He certainly didn’t mince words. The 
minority leader of the U.S. Senate 
threatened two sitting Supreme Court 
Justices based on the potential out-
come of a case they are considering. 
That is the only way to interpret what 
he said. 
It is no surprise to any of us that the 
Senator from New York is no fan of the 
two most recent additions on the 
Court, but a fiery floor speech and a 
downright threat of violence are two 
very different things. 
We have heard some of our Demo-
cratic 
colleagues 
voice 
their 
mis-
givings about the Court, but no one, to 
my knowledge, has sunk so low as to 
threaten sitting Justices. As you would 
expect, the shock and outrage were im-
mediate. Liberal legal scholar Lau-
rence Tribe denounced Senator SCHU-
MER. Even Chief Justice Roberts issued 
a rare public rebuke, calling the com-
ments not only inappropriate but dan-
gerous. 
The simple end to this story would be 
that our colleague would apologize to 
Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, 
and to the American people, but in-
stead of doing that, he has doubled 
down. His office has accused the Chief 
Justice somehow of bias and said Sen-
ator SCHUMER was referring to Repub-
lican lawmakers, not the Associate 
Justices, as if inciting violence against 
Republican lawmakers is somehow ac-
ceptable, too, in the wake of what hap-
pened to STEVE
SCALISE

S1585 
March 5, 2020 
Members of Congress just a short time 
previously. But the minority leader did 
not fumble over words. He clearly 
named 
Justices 
Gorsuch 
and 
Kavanaugh in his threat, and when it 
caught the inevitable firestorm, his of-
fice deliberately tried to mislead the 
American people about what he said. 
‘‘[P]ay the price. You won’t know 
what hit you’’—those are not the types 
of statements we need from any elected 
official, let alone one of the highest 
ranking Democrats in the country, nor 
are they a good example because oth-
ers—maybe 
vulnerable 
persons—who 
hear words like that may become in-
cited to take things into their own 
hands in innumerable ways that we 
can’t anticipate. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
our 
col-
leagues on the other side, including the 
junior Senator from Rhode Island, fell 
in line and chose to echo the minority 
leader in criticizing the Chief Justice. 
It doesn’t matter what case is before 
the Supreme Court or what ruling is 
ultimately handed down; congressional 
leaders must set an example for the 
American people and respect the inde-
pendence of the judiciary and the three 
coequal branches of government. We 
have 
had 
innumerable 
discussions 
about hate speech and threats of vio-
lence against our leaders and politi-
cians. The last thing we need is one of 
the most powerful men in the country 
making a threat against Supreme 
Court 
Justices. 
It 
doesn’t 
matter 
whether you are a fourth grader on the 
playground or a U.S. Senator—our les-
son should be that violence is never the 
answer and that words matter. 
The simple end of this would be for 
Senator SCHUMER to apologize to the 
Justices for his attacks, by name: Jus-
tice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and 
Chief Justice Roberts. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, on another matter, at 
the beginning of February, the Air 
Force announced that my hometown, 
San Antonio, would be one of the quar-
antine sites for Americans evacuated 
from China due to the coronavirus. 
Lackland Air Force Base is home to an 
incredibly 
dedicated 
and 
talented 
group of airmen, and I thank the Air 
Force for their assistance in housing 
these American evacuates during their 
quarantine period. Also, the State of 
Texas and the city of San Antonio have 
many hard-working medical profes-
sionals, and I have no doubt that these 
patients who developed symptoms have 
received top-notch care while at Meth-
odist Hospital and the Texas Center for 
Infectious Disease. 
But there was and still is serious con-
cern about the larger public health im-
pact this virus could have. A couple of 
weeks ago, I brought together the city 
of San Antonio officials, like the 
mayor and two members of city coun-
cil, for meetings with the Department 
of Health and Human Services and the 
Defense Department to discuss the on-
going mission concerns and challenges. 
The mayor and the city council had 
some legitimate questions and con-
cerns they needed answered. 
I felt like, at the time, the meeting 
was a positive step to help encourage 
coordination between local officials 
and their Federal partners, but now 
there is even higher concern after we 
learned one patient was released only 
to later find out the test result indi-
cated her virus was still active. At the 
end of her treatment, in accordance 
with CDC guidelines, the patient was 
tested on two occasions with a 24-hour 
intervening period, which was protocol 
at the time, and she was ultimately re-
leased. Following her release, though, a 
test that the CDC was unaware was 
conducted returned results indicating 
the patient was still a weak positive 
for the virus. At that point, she was re-
turned to isolation, after spending 
about 12 hours in the broader San An-
tonio community, including time at a 
shopping mall and a hotel. 
While I am glad this mistake was 
caught and corrected, it raises serious 
questions that need to be answered to 
ensure the continued protection of the 
American people. 
Earlier this week, Senator CRUZ and 
I sent a letter to the Director of the 
Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Robert 
Redfield, asking him to explain how 
this incident happened and how it 
could be avoided in the future. Now 
that the majority of the individuals 
who had been evacuated from the Dia-
mond Princess cruise ship, as well as 
from 
Wuhan 
Province—repatriated 
Americans—have been released from 
quarantine, what steps is the Centers 
for Disease Control taking to ensure 
they are truly clear of the virus? How 
are they monitoring those released 
from 
quarantine, 
and 
what 
public 
health risks does the larger population 
face after their release? 
After a lot of conversations, we also 
asked Director Redfield if additional 
evacuees will be brought to Texas for 
quarantine and what will happen if San 
Antonio’s health resources reach their 
maximum capacity. 
I think it is fair to say that my 
hometown is carrying more than its 
fair share of this international out-
break, and its residents deserve an-
swers. As we continue to see headlines 
about the spread of the virus in Wash-
ington State, New York, California, 
and others, it is clear that time is of 
the essence. 
As we seek those answers, I encour-
age all of my constituents and all 
Americans to read the best guidance on 
how to keep themselves and their fami-
lies safe. While this is a new virus, the 
same old techniques that your mother 
taught you while you were growing up 
apply: Wash your hands, disinfect com-
monly touched household surfaces, and 
avoid contact with those who are sick. 
That is just common sense. Try to 
avoid touching your face, be sure to 
cover your cough or sneeze, and stay 
home if you are not feeling well. Those 
are the commonsense ways we can pro-
tect ourselves. 
I am incredibly grateful to the 
healthcare workers around the world 
who are battling this virus and the 
dedicated scientists who are working 
hard to develop a vaccine. 
In the past few days, I have spoken 
with President Trump, Secretary Azar, 
and my colleagues on the Appropria-
tions Committee—who did good work 
on this supplemental appropriations we 
just voted on—about the need for addi-
tional coordination and resources, and 
I thank each of them for their commit-
ment in keeping Americans and Texans 
safe. 
In this supplemental appropriations 
bill that we just voted on, I requested 
funding for State and local commu-
nities—including San Antonio—which 
have been at the forefront of this bat-
tle, and today we delivered a big win 
for them. The supplemental funding 
bill we just passed will make $950 mil-
lion available for reimbursement for 
the costs Texas and other States across 
the country have incurred while moni-
toring and treating individuals exposed 
to the coronavirus. 
I want to thank Senator SHELBY and 
the ranking member, Senator LEAHY, 
for their work on this, and I am glad 
this much needed relief is now on the 
way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). Without objection, 
it is so ordered. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, one 
thing that is on everybody’s mind right 
now is this: How do we prepare to ad-
dress the coronavirus? I speak not just 
as a Senator but, perhaps even more 
particularly, as a physician who has 
done public health in my previous prac-
tice, 
working 
with 
immunizations, 
looking at all those issues as to who is 
vulnerable and who needs to be pro-
tected. 
There are a couple of things that are 
quite apparent from what we have al-
ready learned from this epidemic. Let 
me compliment the Chinese. They have 
come in for some criticism that was 
well deserved, but in other things they 
have helped determine a lot of things 
that will benefit the rest of the world 
in terms of the natural history of 
coronavirus. 
By the way, the theme of this talk is 
that we have to make sure that 
coronavirus medications are going to 
be available and affordable for senior 
citizens. Why do I emphasize senior 
citizens? One thing we have learned 
from the Chinese is that those who are 
50 and above—and 65 and above, in par-
ticular—are the ones who are most 
likely to die from being exposed to and 
infected with coronavirus. That is our 
Medicare Part D population. If you

March 5, 2020 
have a chronic illness—and chronic ill-
ness can be hypertension, high blood 
pressure—again, you are particularly 
susceptible. If we know that our Medi-
care population is most vulnerable, let 
us focus particularly upon them. 
First, science is working. There are 
at least six vaccines that are being de-
veloped to attempt to address the 
coronavirus. Hopefully, one of them 
will work. There are other therapies 
being developed. Some of them are 
medications. Four different medicines 
are now being tested to see if they are 
the 
ones 
that 
absolutely 
prevent 
coronavirus. We know whatever drug 
that is could end up being quite expen-
sive. For the Medicare Part D bene-
ficiary, that leads into this discussion: 
How do we make sure those drugs are 
effective? 
Let me show you the current situa-
tion. This is the Medicare Part D 
standard benefit parameter under cur-
rent law. In the orange is that which 
the beneficiary pays, the Medicare Part 
D beneficiary. The blue is what the in-
surance plan pays. The green is what 
the manufacturer pays. The dark blue 
is what the taxpayer pays, the Medi-
care system. 
What you see is, initially, beneath 
the 
deductible, 
the 
Part 
D 
bene-
ficiary—the senior citizen on Medicare 
Part D—pays 100 percent. Then, you go 
into what is called the initial coverage 
phase, 25 percent; the coverage gap 
phase, 25 percent; and then above the 
catastrophic coverage, the senior cit-
izen pays 5 percent, no matter how 
much that drug costs. That drug could 
cost $1 million, and they are going to 
pay 5 percent under current law. 
By the way, that is the list price. 
Even if the manufacturer and the phar-
macy benefit manager have a deal 
where the drug might be priced at 
$100,000 but the rebate is $50,000 that 
goes back to the manufacturer—so 
your net price is $50,000—the bene-
ficiary is paying 5 percent of the list 
price. She is paying 5 percent of 
$100,000. She does not benefit from any 
rebates. This is current law. 
We can imagine if a drug that is 
quickly developed, expensive to de-
velop, and expensive to produce—and it 
is the only one that works against the 
coronavirus—it is going to be an expen-
sive drug. We can also imagine if it is 
an old drug that happens to work, 
there might be somebody who buys it, 
closes down all the competition, and 
then charges an arm and a leg for this 
one old medicine—off patent for dec-
ades—that happens to be the one medi-
cine that actually works to prevent the 
progression of coronavirus infection. 
How do we protect the senior citizen? 
Right now, one more time, she is ex-
posed to 5 percent of the cost, no mat-
ter how expensive it is, under current 
law. There are a couple of proposals 
out there right now. One of them is on 
the House side, called H.R. 3, and the 
other principal bill on the Senate side 
is called Grassley-Wyden. I am going to 
rename it in a second. But let me just 
say those are the two bills. 
Mr. President, you know this, but for 
the folks watching, I will explain the 
tension. Whatever we do to control the 
cost of medication has to preserve the 
incentive for industry—for pharma-
ceutical companies and vaccine manu-
facturers—to continue to innovate. If 
you take away all their profits, they 
will just go home. Why invest billions 
of dollars if you don’t make a profit? 
On the other hand, if they are able to 
charge so much that no one can afford 
it, no matter how innovative they are, 
it is as if the innovation never oc-
curred. 
If the theme of this discussion is 
‘‘How 
do 
we 
make 
sure 
that 
coronavirus medications are available 
and affordable for the senior citizen?’’ 
we have to strike that balance. It has 
to be the balance between encouraging 
innovation by allowing a profit but not 
so much profit that the senior citizen 
cannot afford it, and it is as if the in-
novation never occurred. 
So far there are two options. There is 
a bill on the House side called H.R. 3. A 
lot of what they have is very similar to 
that which was passed in the Senate, 
which I personally think is a very good 
bill. But they have one provision that 
says the Federal Government can dic-
tate to the pharmaceutical company: 
This is how much you charge. And if 
you don’t accept our price, ultimately, 
we will take 95 percent of your profits. 
If we are going to try to incentivize 
companies to come up with new medi-
cations 
to 
fight 
cancer, 
to 
fight 
coronavirus, to fight Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, we can’t go to them at the get-go 
and say: If you don’t accept the price 
we dictate, we are going to take 95 per-
cent of your profit. 
That is the way you end up with no 
innovation whatsoever. Even though 
there is a fair part of that bill that is 
constructed, that one is a deal breaker, 
and I can tell you that this doctor, who 
has seen a tremendous amount of inno-
vation that has saved so many lives, 
will not agree to a provision that kills 
innovation. 
But then we go to the other side. 
What about the bill that we have here 
in Senate Finance? It came out of the 
Senate Finance Committee on a bipar-
tisan basis, and on that bipartisan 
basis, it saves taxpayers $80 to $100 bil-
lion over 10 years. Drug companies still 
make their profit. They still have the 
incentive to innovate, but taxpayers 
also save. 
Most importantly, for the sake of 
this talk—which is how we make 
coronavirus medications affordable to 
the senior citizen when they become 
available—we cap the amount of money 
the senior citizen has to pay for her 
drugs. They no longer pay 5 percent of 
this price, even if the list price is $1 
million. We are going to cap that so 
the senior citizen can afford it. One 
thing we also do is protect the tax-
payer from having to pay so much and, 
instead, ask the manufacturers and the 
pharmacy benefit managers to pay 
their fair share. 
But for the purposes of this talk, in-
stead of current law where it is 5 per-
cent no matter how much it is, what 
the senior citizen has to pay is capped, 
so however much that coronavirus drug 
costs, the senior can afford it. She will 
not die because she can’t afford to pay 
5 percent of a list price no matter how 
high that list price is. 
This so-called Grassley-Wyden bill 
has passed out of the Senate Finance 
Committee. It needs to come to the 
floor of the Senate. We need to have a 
vote on it because as we prepare to 
fight the coronavirus—to literally put 
in policies that will save lives of our 
senior citizens—one of those has to be 
this: How do we make sure the drug is 
affordable? 
I am renaming Grassley-Wyden. I am 
now calling Grassley-Wyden the ‘‘Mak-
ing Coronavirus Drugs Affordable.’’ It 
caps out-of-pocket expenses; it lets pa-
tients pay over time, not all at once in 
January and February; it protects pa-
tients from price gouging; it preserves 
the innovation that does bring us these 
new drugs. 
We have lots of stuff coming through 
this Congress to address our Nation’s 
vulnerability to coronavirus. We need 
to focus on those who are most vulner-
able, those who are 65 and above. We 
applaud industry, pharmaceutical com-
panies, researchers, and vaccine manu-
facturers for the effort they are put-
ting in to find those drugs. We thank 
the Chinese for running many of these 
clinical trials that will hopefully es-
tablish that one of these drugs is actu-
ally effective. Yet what we must do is 
continue to allow innovation and, at 
the 
same 
time, 
make 
sure 
that 
coronavirus drugs are affordable. This 
bill will pass the Senate if it comes to 
the floor. I ask that it be brought to 
the floor. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

S. 2657 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
appreciate the strong vote that we had 
yesterday, 90 to 4, to advance and con-
tinue debate on S. 2657. 
Just after that vote was concluded, I 
laid down a substitute amendment that 
contains the full text of the bipartisan 
American Energy Innovation Act. Hav-
ing done that, we would normally begin 
the process of voting on amendments, 
whether by voice or by rollcall in this 
so-called regular order. We certainly 
have no shortage of options. We have 
some 200 amendments that have now 
been filed to the bill. What we are 
missing is a little bit of cooperation so 
that we can actually reach consent and 
move to votes. 
We could not reach agreement to 
have votes throughout the course of

March 5, 2020 
this week from Monday until, effec-
tively, now. It has been frustrating. 
Both Senator MANCHIN and I have been 
working to try to facilitate that. We 
want to take amendments. The leader 
wants us to take amendments. We have 
a good bill. We think we have a pretty 
strong bill, but we know that it is al-
ways possible to make it better by 
gathering those ideas from colleagues 
who have not been part of the process 
on the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee. We want to address those 
priorities from as many Members as we 
can. 
While we were blocked on votes this 
week, our staffs have been working to-
gether—Senator MANCHIN’s and mine— 
to develop a modified substitute that 
will add to the original text. We now 
have a total of 18 filed amendments 
that will be included as part of the un-
derlying text. We have been working 
this week—maybe not actively out on 
the floor with a process where folks are 
voting—but we have been able to take 
some of these consensus areas, bring 
them together, and put them into a 
modified text. 
This is not my preferred approach. If 
we could do it the good old-fashioned 
way, if you will, through individual 
votes or a managers’ amendment—a 
managers’ package—that is great. But 
a modified substitute was the only op-
tion that was available to us, recog-
nizing that we have limited time on 
the floor, and we were still not able to 
form that path forward. 
I want to speak quickly about what 
is very much a highlight. Our modified 
substitute includes an even number of 
priorities from both sides, some with 
amendments, some with modifications. 
We have been able to take provisions 
from the Senator from Arizona, the 
Senator from Rhode Island, Senator 
ERNST of Iowa, FEINSTEIN of California, 
TILLIS of North Carolina, from New 
Hampshire, South Dakota, Senator 
HASSAN, Senator SHAHEEN, Senator 
ENZI of Wyoming, DUCKWORTH of Illi-
nois, CRAMER of North Dakota, CASEY 
of Pennsylvania, ROMNEY
of Utah, 
BROWN of Ohio, WICKER of Mississippi, 
STABENOW of Michigan, RISCH of Idaho, 
Senator MARKEY of Massachusetts—18 
different provisions, which added to 
what we had done previously. 
We have priorities from nearly 70 
Members of the Senate. That makes a 
good, strong bipartisan bill even better 
and stronger. 
We now need to move to our final 
steps. Just a bit ago, the majority lead-
er filed cloture on our modified sub-
stitute amendment, which will allow us 
to hold that vote on Monday evening. 
As we look to complete our work on 
this bipartisan innovation package, 
know that we are going to be doing 
that throughout today, tomorrow, and 
through the weekend. 
I want to address very quickly now 
some of the support that the American 
Energy Innovation Act has received. 
We have focused on the priorities that 
it contains for Members here in the 
Senate, but we have also drawn strong 
support from many stakeholders out-
side. A group of 39 major trade associa-
tions, think tanks, advocacy groups, 
and environmental groups wrote us to 
express their strong support for our en-
ergy innovation package. The signato-
ries include the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the National Association of 
Manufacturers, the Environmental De-
fense Fund, and the Nature Conser-
vancy—just to name a few of the many. 
Here are some of the comments that 
we have heard. 
They wrote: 
Our diverse organizations recognize and 
agree that climate change is an important 
national priority that demands Congres-
sional attention. While we may not agree on 
everything, we believe there is much com-
mon ground upon which all sides of the de-
bate can come together to begin to address 
climate change, promote American techno-
logical leadership, and foster continued eco-
nomic growth. In particular, there is a grow-
ing consensus that the development and 
commercialization of new technologies are 
important factors that will determine how 
quickly and at what cost greenhouse gas 
emissions can be reduced. 
The American Energy Innovation Act will 
help do just that . . . [It] will accelerate 
these breakthroughs and enable adoption of 
lower emitting and more efficient tech-
nologies . . . Congress now has its best op-
portunity in more than a decade to enact 
significant energy legislation. 
That is a pretty strong statement 
from those organizations. 
The 
National 
Mining 
Association 
wrote to us, whose members under-
stand as well as anyone that clean 
technologies rely on raw materials. 
It wrote: ‘‘This forward-looking legis-
lation takes steps to address the na-
tion’s alarming mineral import reli-
ance and brings the United States to 
the forefront of research and develop-
ment efforts in carbon capture tech-
nologies.’’ 
The Consumer Energy Alliance wrote 
that our American Energy Innovation 
Act ‘‘provides opportunities to make 
real progress on the energy issues and 
environmental 
protections 
that 
all 
Americans support.’’ 
The Bipartisan Policy Center wrote 
that our bill is ‘‘a landmark piece of 
legislation representing a down pay-
ment on the innovation necessary to 
decarbonize our energy sector and mod-
ernize our nation’s energy policies.’’ 
The Business Council for Sustainable 
Energy wrote: ‘‘The bipartisan intro-
duction of the American Energy Inno-
vation 
Act 
demonstrates 
Congress’ 
commitment to innovation in the U.S. 
energy sector.’’ 
All told, we have received support 
from more than 200 groups, companies, 
and organizations for this legislation. 
These are groups that are really in-
volved in keeping the lights on in big 
cities, in small communities, and all 
across the Nation. These involve folks 
from Edison Electric Institute, the 
American Public Power Association, 
and the National Rural Electric Coop-
erative Association. 
These are groups whose members are 
working to keep energy affordable, like 
the American Petroleum Institute and 
the National Ocean Industries Associa-
tion. We appreciate all of them— 
ClearPath Action, Citizens for Respon-
sible Energy Solutions, the Corps Net-
work, the American Wind Energy Asso-
ciation, the Nuclear Energy Institute, 
the Clean Air Task Force, Third Way, 
the Energy Storage Association, and so 
many more that have contacted us and 
have shared their support. 
We are hearing a lot from Alaskans 
as well. As the Alaska Power Associa-
tion wrote in a letter we received this 
week: 
APA and our member electric utilities 
throughout the State reiterate our support 
for the many energy law modernization ele-
ments that comprise your American Energy 
Innovation Act . . . AEIA will help Alaska’s 
far-flung electricity providers and their con-
sumers. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s 
Global Energy Institute wrote: ‘‘We 
urge the Senate to seize this oppor-
tunity to fuel American innovation and 
promote climate action by passing this 
legislation without delay.’’ 
Those are some pretty good words 
coming from them. We certainly would 
agree. 
We had an opportunity this morning, 
in the Committee on Energy and Nat-
ural Resources, to hear from the head 
of the IEA, the International Energy 
Agency, which is based out of Paris, 
France. Dr. Fatih Birol heads up the 
member countries that are part of the 
IEA, and they track trends in energy 
markets. We do an annual update with 
Dr. Birol, and, as usual, his words were 
important, telling, and resounding. 
As we reflect on what Dr. Birol high-
lighted as areas of opportunity for the 
United States to be a global energy 
leader, what we have put in the Amer-
ican Energy Innovation Act is exactly 
the recipe that we should be pursuing 
to continue being a leader in the en-
ergy sector, to being a strong leader 
from an economic perspective, and to 
being a strong leader in energy secu-
rity, in national security, and in envi-
ronmental security. 
We are doing the right thing, and we 
have it within this legislation. We will 
be moving forward more aggressively 
with it next week so that we can get to 
a good and positive conclusion for the 
Senate and for the country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Mr. President, I 
was sworn in 2 months ago and left be-
hind a nearly three-decade business ca-
reer to serve the people of Georgia in 
our Nation’s Capital. It is truly my 
honor to support and defend the Con-
stitution. 
I arrived as impeachment began, one 
of the most divided and partisan times 
in the history of Congress. Now, with 
impeachment behind us and the Presi-
dent’s having been acquitted, ongoing 
partisanship is undermining the Amer-
ican people’s access to facts during a 
public health emergency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1588 
March 5, 2020 
What I have seen in the last few 
weeks has been alarming. Day after 
day, I witness exactly why the Amer-
ican people are fed up with Wash-
ington—the partisan rhetoric, the me-
dia’s sensationalism, the negative po-
litical news—all while America is fac-
ing a public health emergency. 
The government at all levels must 
carry out the responsibility to keep 
Americans safe. Federal agencies and 
the Vice President and our President 
are working relentlessly to do just 
that. We need to be united in our ef-
forts to protect the health and safety 
of all Americans. This is not a time to 
score political points through baseless 
commentary. It is a time for facts. 
I hope my colleagues, the media, and 
political leaders across America will 
continue to put Americans first and 
put politics aside while we prepare to 
combat this outbreak. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TENNESSEE TORNADOES 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, as 
I begin my remarks today, I express 
my thanks to my colleagues here in 
this Chamber and, certainly, all across 
Capitol Hill who have extended their 
thoughts and their prayers and have 
asked ‘‘How are you doing?’’ when it 
comes to talking about Tennessee and 
our citizens and those who have been 
so adversely impacted by the tornadoes 
this week. 
The damage is absolutely indescrib-
able. Even though, on early Tuesday 
morning, when the news broke and I 
started watching some of the local TV 
stations that had put drones up there 
around Nashville and Putnam County 
and over in Wilson County, I could not 
appreciate the extent of this damage 
until I walked these neighborhoods. 
That is something I did yesterday. 
You can see the damage. Commu-
nities are now debris fields. It is just 
indescribable the power of this storm— 
an F–2, an F–3, and an F–4. These tor-
nadoes 
ripped 
through 
Tennessee— 
through Carroll County, Gibson Coun-
ty, Humphreys County, Benton County, 
Davidson County, Wilson County, and 
Putnam County. The damage that they 
have seen on the ground is sometimes 
for 50 miles. It is just absolutely inde-
scribable. 
What we have seen are many families 
who have been left homeless. Their 
homes are now piles of rubble. We have 
seen over 100,000 Tennesseans initially 
without electricity, but because of the 
good work of the TVA, which is the 
power generator, and our local power 
distributors, we have that number 
worked down to 23,550. So that is begin-
ning to improve, and the lights are, in-
deed, coming back on. Yet the damage 
is still there and the loss of property. 
It is going to be in the hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars. Those estimates are 
beginning to take place, but there is a 
lot of work to do. 
The loss of life is, indeed, the most 
tender as 24 individuals have lost their 
lives—18 in Putnam County. We have 
children who have lost their lives. We 
have dozens who have been injured and 
who have been hospitalized. We still 
have some individuals who are unac-
counted for and are missing. So there 
is a long way back to normalcy as we 
look at this situation. 
I will tell you that I give a lot of 
credit to our Governor and the leader-
ship that he has shown as we have 
worked through this. He did get a for-
mal request submitted to FEMA today. 
He has asked for President Trump to 
issue a major disaster declaration. This 
is going to include individual assist-
ance for Davidson, Putnam, and Wilson 
Counties; public assistance for Benton, 
Carroll, Davidson, Gibson, Putnam, 
and Wilson Counties; and hazard miti-
gation statewide. He has also requested 
Small Business Administration loans 
for several counties. 
This is catastrophic damage. As our 
teams worked together to assess the 
situation and as I worked yesterday 
with our State’s insurance commis-
sioner; 
with 
Director 
Sheehan 
of 
TEMA, the Tennessee Emergency Man-
agement Agency; with General Holmes, 
our Adjutant General for the National 
Guard; and FEMA, with its regional Di-
rector, one of the things that was so 
significant was that the debris field 
went on for miles and miles and miles 
outside of the areas that were hit. So 
we know this is going to take a little 
while. 
I do have some information that I 
want to share. The Tennessee Emer-
gency Management Agency has taken 
the lead in organizing the shelters and 
the command centers on the ground in 
order to get this information out to in-
dividuals in the State and to the indi-
viduals around the country who have 
family who live in these areas. 
There are three contact points that I 
want to bring attention to: the home 
and 
property 
cleanup 
hotline, 
the 
statewide crisis phone line, and then, 
for individuals who are trying to figure 
out how to access help for recovery, 
the website TN.gov/TEMA. There is a 
resource directory—an aggregation—of 
where to go to find help and informa-
tion. 
The crisis phone line is a mental 
health phone line because the impact 
of this kind of tragedy just cannot be 
understated. 
So, as I said, two important phone 
numbers—one can help you if you need 
emergency cleanup, and another will 
connect you to trained mental health 
professionals. Individuals should be en-
couraged to call if they have need 
there. 
On the website, you will find shelter 
locations, emergency accommodations 
and transportation, and just some 
practical information on that cleanup 
and then kind of next steps as you go 
about filing claims and rebuilding. 
So we do look forward to individuals 
having access to this information and 
using it because we know that we want 
to be there and help them to recover 
during this terrible time. 
Tennessee is a State that is known 
for its volunteer spirit, and as you look 
through some of the social media posts 
that were coming out during this 
storm and after the storm and you see 
the horror of what was transpiring 
with the tornadoes, you also see hope, 
and you see how the elected officials— 
those local officials in these commu-
nities—have stepped up and have taken 
the lead. Our mayors and our sheriffs 
are to be commended for the work they 
are doing and also our emergency re-
sponse personnel, all of our first re-
sponders, for the way they have shown 
up and they have worked through. 
Some of them worked through 36, 40 
hours without a break in order to re-
spond to this. 
I was at the State Emergency Oper-
ations Center, and in Tennessee we 
have, at our National Guard facility, 
the TEMA response facility, and indi-
viduals would be so encouraged to see 
this working because you have rep-
resentatives from the highway patrol 
and from the TBI and from the Red 
Cross and from so many different State 
agencies, and they are working there 
together to meet the needs of Ten-
nesseans. 
On Tuesday evening, when I landed, I 
went straight over to the operations 
center, and there was one gentleman, 
and he had his puppy there. So of 
course that was the first thing I want-
ed to do, was meet his pet. He was 
there working with him. And I found 
out that this employee, Brandon Ward, 
actually had slept on a cot there at the 
facility because he had lost his home. 
So what did he do? The storm hits. His 
home gets hit. He heads over to work. 
He has his pet with him. He was stay-
ing there, helping others even though 
he had experienced loss. 
We were at a shelter, and there was a 
nurse, a paramedic, who was there, and 
I found out she was from Bowling 
Green, KY. I asked why she had chosen 
to come. She said: We knew you needed 
help. So she came from Bowling Green 
to fill in until someone could get there 
and handle a shift. Helping people. 
Meeting their needs. 
We have seen Tennesseans by the 
thousands show up. Big smiles. They 
have got water. They have got food. 
They have brought along chainsaws 
and tractors and bulldozers and four 
wheelers—everything needed to clear 
these debris fields, to move into these 
communities where houses once stood, 
and to help these individuals who are 
seeking to push forward in rebuilding 
their lives, cleaning up the damage 
that has been left by this storm, sifting 
through what was once their home and 
finding those precious mementos. That 
is what is happening in Tennessee this 
week.

S1589 
March 5, 2020 
We know this is going to be a long 
road back, but we also know we are 
getting special attention with FEMA 
being on the ground. 
Tomorrow, we are going to welcome 
President Trump to the State, and he 
will be able to see firsthand what has 
happened by an unprecedented storm 
that swept through this State on the 
ground for 50 miles—an F–4 tornado— 
and he is also going to see Tennesseans 
working together. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS 
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to talk about what turns into a 
perennial topic, and that is how we 
fund our military. 
We are in a situation that in the last 
45 years, we have only funded the Fed-
eral Government four times on time. 
Yet we see a situation where the world 
is more dangerous than at any time in 
my lifetime. We face five threats 
across five domains—this has increased 
over the last 15 or 20 years—and at the 
same time, we have been at work for 20 
years against terrorism. That war has 
not abated. It has not gone away. It is 
still there. 
We now face five threats—primarily, 
China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and 
terrorism—across five domains: air, 
land, sea, cyber, and now space. Yet, 
with that backdrop, the world being 
more dangerous than at any time in 
my lifetime—and I remember the Cold 
War. I remember the Cuban missile cri-
sis. These are things that, in my child-
hood, really imprinted on my brain 
how dangerous the world can be. Yet, 
today, I say with some qualification, 
the world is more dangerous than at 
any time in my lifetime. Yet, three 
times in the last 50 years—the last 
three Democratic Presidents cut spend-
ing in our military by 25 percent. That 
was in the late 1970s, in the mid-1990s, 
and just in the last decade. This is dev-
astating. We saw that in readiness in 
January of 2017. Two-thirds of our F/A– 
18s couldn’t fly. We had only 3 Army 
brigades ready to fight out of 59. 
This was a devastating thing we did 
to the U.S. military, and it hasn’t gone 
away today. Today—even today—under 
Republican leadership in this Senate, 
this is something that has been going 
on for decades; that is, we use some-
thing called continuing resolutions. 
Let me describe where we are today. 
The reason I am here speaking to the 
body is that we are beginning the au-
thorization process for defense and 
other 
authorizing 
functions 
within 
committees, leading to the appropria-
tions process, which was supposed to be 
completed by September 30 this year, 
the end of our fiscal year. Well, we are 
in the sixth fiscal month of this fiscal 
year, which ends September 30, and we 
are just now beginning this process— 
for a lot of reasons, impeachment being 
one. There are several other reasons 
contributing to the fact that we are 
late in this process. So we are staring 
down the barrel of another continuing 
resolution, which we now know costs 
the U.S. military $5 billion per quarter. 
For 12 of the last 13 years, the Con-
gress has put a continuing resolution 
in place for the first quarter of each 
new fiscal year. Only in 2018, when this 
body stayed here in August and wres-
tled this issue to the ground, did we 
fund the military by the end of the fis-
cal year—only one time in the last 13 
years. As a matter of fact, in 2018 when 
we got 75 percent of the budget funded, 
that was the first time in 22 years we 
had gotten that much funded. 
This is ridiculous. It is broken. We 
have to fix it. The victim of that has 
been the U.S. military. This is dev-
astating on their operation of rebuild-
ing readiness and now on the recapital-
ization program we are beginning in 
earnest. 
Over the last 20 years, shipbuilding 
has been devastated. We have lost some 
20,000 vendors across all of the DOD, 
most of those in shipbuilding. Almost 
14,000 primary vendors have been lost 
in the supply chain. 
Now, even if we were to fund a re-
capitalization effort that would get us 
back to being on par with some of our 
peer competitors, I question whether 
we even have the supply chain today to 
do that. This is a major challenge for 
us right now. 
Technology is building, our lethality 
is building, the way we fight our fleet 
is building, but we have to be serious 
about maintaining continuity of fund-
ing across decades with regard to this 
capability we have. We are the 800- 
pound gorilla beneath the sea today, 
but today we are outgunned and 
outsticked by one of our ‘‘near peer 
competitors,’’ and that is China. 
We have a 2016 shipbuilding plan that 
was done prior to the 2017 national de-
fense strategy, the NDS. In the ship-
building plan of 2016, it called for 355 
ships by 2034. These are submarines, 
amphibious ships, heavy combatant 
ships, aircraft carriers—over the next 
15 years. 
Well, the NDS was done in 2017. We 
still don’t know what that shipbuilding 
plan is to support the NDS. The new 
plan is on the desk of the Secretary of 
Defense. I understand he is taking his 
time to make sure he understands the 
requirements. He has a particular prob-
lem because of the budget. I get that. 
But I want to highlight today what 
we are up against. Today, China has 355 
ships in their navy; we have 296. That 
is a 54-ship disadvantage that we al-
ready have today in 2020. That is dev-
astating. Most people in America don’t 
think that. They don’t know that. 
Oh, by the way, they really have only 
one area of operations—the Indo-Pa-
cific region, although that is changing. 
But we have multiple areas of oper-
ation around the world. So this is a 
huge disadvantage we already have 
today. 
If you look at the next 15 years to 
2034, they are projected to go to 435 
ships; we are hoping to get to 355 under 
the current plan of 2016. That may 
change when we see this new ship-
building plan, which, by the way, was 
due when the budget was submitted to 
Congress. That is an 80-ship delta—80- 
ship disadvantage that we have to 
China. That doesn’t count what Russia 
is investing in its new technology, sub-
marine, and surface fleet. 
We also know what China is doing 
with the Belt and Road Initiative on 
the back of this incremental capability 
they have in the naval power that they 
have been developing for the last 30 
years. That is the Belt and Road Initia-
tive where they go into more than 30 
ports in Africa, over 50 ports in Latin 
America—that is South America and 
Central America—where they make 
these proprietary loans. They have al-
ready foreclosed on two of those propri-
etary 
loans—one 
in 
Colombo, 
Sri 
Lanka, and the other in Karachi, Paki-
stan, where they have actually taken 
possession and they are now building 
military naval bases in those ports. 
Add to that what we see them doing 
and have done in the South China Sea. 
I actually was blessed to be able to go 
with the Navy on a flyover—part of a 
Freedom of Navigation Operation in 
the South China Sea—to see exactly 
what China has done there. We saw 
Coast Guard ships 1,000 kilometers off 
the coast of China down in the South 
China Sea, patrolling the waters, as if 
they were within the 12-mile legal 
limit of China. 
We believe that we can compete. 
Today we are still the 800-pound go-
rilla. Our technology and our sailors 
and pilots in the Navy and our marines 
are the best in the world. We can stand 
up to the threat today. 
My question and caution today, as we 
are looking at this authorization for 
our defense and for the budgeting 
therein, we have to make sure that 
over the next 15 years that we do this 
shipbuilding plan, we maintain a more 
consistent and better funding for that 
plan so we can rebuild the supply chain 
in order to build this capability. 
Let me state one other thing. The 
number of ships is a function of the dis-
tribution of those ships—how many 
small ships, large ships, carriers, sub-
marines, and so forth. I get that. But 
the other is also a function of how the 
Navy will fight that. There are new 
doctrines being put in place. The Ad-
vanced Battle Management System is 
going in, and we are increasing dra-
matically the lethality of the weapons 
and the munitions on these vessels. 
That is the encouraging part. The dis-
couraging part is that China has the 
lead right now with regard to range 
and speed and a few other things in 
terms of their munitions. I am con-
fident we will catch up with that. 
We have the first ever—thanks to 
President Trump, we have the first- 
ever audit of the DOD. It came to us 1 
year ago. We have been looking at it. It 
identified $4 billion of obsolete pro-
grams they wanted to get rid of. Be-
tween that $4 billion and the $5 billion

that is going to be wasted this year 
alone, if we end up with another CR in 
the 
October, 
November, 
December 
timeframe, that is $9 billion. That is 
almost 40 percent of 1 year’s ship-
building plan. That is serious money, 
and it is up to us to get that taken care 
of and to find that money and to re-
build this Navy. 
Let me close with this. The next 50 to 
100 years will be determined in the next 
3 to 5 years, in terms of our relation-
ship not only with China but with Rus-
sia, Iran, North Korea, and the other 
threats we have around the world. We 
have to establish with our allies, par-
ticularly our NATO allies and also 
Japan—to make sure that they get 
their investments moving in the right 
direction so that, collectively, we can 
stand up to this growing threat around 
the world. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

TALIBAN 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 
the fall of 2001—it seems like forever 
ago—Trae Young, the great OU point 
guard and now Atlanta Hawks phenom, 
was just 3 years old. Darius Bazley, a 
player for the Thunder right now, one 
of the young guys, he was just barely 1 
year old in the fall of 2001. 
At that same time period now, al-
most 20 years ago, there was a man 
named Osama bin Laden working with 
a small group of people in a country 
called Afghanistan that most Ameri-
cans could not even find on a map at 
the time. He was meeting privately 
with them to organize an attack on 
Americans that we could have never 
imagined. He was training individuals 
and 
sneaking 
individuals 
into 
the 
United States, training them further to 
be pilots and preparing them for an at-
tack that happened September 11, 2001. 
There is not a soul who was alive 
during that time period who doesn’t re-
member where they were and what was 
happening on September 11, 2001. All of 
us, we were locked to our TVs watch-
ing an airplane fly into a side of a 
building and kill thousands of our 
friends and neighbors. 
On September 14, the U.S. Congress 
passed an authorization for the use of 
military force for those individuals 
who carried out this attack, 3 days 
after that attack. By October 7, the 
first troops had landed in Afghanistan. 
They were organizing an effort to find 
Osama bin Laden and to eliminate the 
threat of them carrying that out again. 
The very clear mandate at the time 
was to work with the government at 
that time in Afghanistan, the Taliban, 
who were a ruthless dictatorship. They 
had spread their hatred across Afghani-
stan, but they had also made a deal 
with al-Qaida to hide them inside of Af-
ghanistan. And the Taliban, who will-
ingly allowed Osama bin Laden and the 
terrorist group they knew was a ter-
rorist group to remain there, became 
the spark for us to go to the Taliban 
and say: Either turn Osama bin Laden 
over to the United States for trial and 
those who were with him in al-Qaida or 
we will come get them. And the 
Taliban’s choice was to say: Come and 
get him, which we did. 
Over the years, 775,000 American 
troops have deployed to Afghanistan at 
least once—775,000. There were 40 dif-
ferent nations that participated with 
us in Operation Enduring Freedom to 
remove the threat from that region of 
al-Qaida attacking us. Our twofold pur-
pose was: Remove Osama bin Laden 
and al-Qaida’s leadership organization 
and their ability to attack the United 
States and our allies, and No. 2, remove 
the Taliban from leadership in Afghan-
istan because they allowed al-Qaida to 
function and to operate in their coun-
try, and they would willingly do it 
again, so they could not be allowed to 
remain in Afghanistan as leaders. 
Those were our two agendas going into 
Afghanistan. 
I am proud to say that the United 
States has won this war with Afghani-
stan. Al-Qaida has been decimated. We 
hunted down Osama bin Laden until, in 
2011, we found him and took him and 
his core leadership out at his facility in 
Pakistan. We continue to drive al- 
Qaida into chaos and oblivion. We con-
tinue to hunt down the Taliban and 
their leadership, pushing them out of 
any semblance of leadership in Afghan-
istan and isolating them in every area 
we can. They have sanctions from all 
over the world against them, and their 
name has become synonymous with 
those who allow terrorism. 
Since the time period that we moved 
in and we won this war, four Presi-
dential elections have happened in Af-
ghanistan. As they have seen the 
peaceful transition of power, as messy 
as it is in many other parts of the 
world—including us—they have seen 
four 
elections 
happen 
there. 
Pre-
viously, under the Taliban’s ruthless 
thumb, women could not work or at-
tend school. Now, 36 percent of the 
country’s workforce is female, 40 per-
cent of elementary students are fe-
male, and 33 percent of university stu-
dents are female. There has been a tre-
mendous transition in what is hap-
pening in Afghanistan. 
They are still a Third World country 
and still struggling in many areas. We 
have seen Afghanistan begin to start to 
get some traction there. Their military 
training has partnered with American 
leadership—generals all the way down 
to the infantry level—to meet with 
Americans and learn how to have a 
professional fighting force there. 
Now, are there issues that still re-
main in Afghanistan? Absolutely. Af-
ghanistan has a long history of being a 
tribal region, with tribal leaders in 
multiple areas, and a difficulty in unit-
ing a very large country. But after four 
Presidential 
elections 
and 
through 
multiple areas of peaceful growth, it is 
time to bring this war to an end. 
To answer the question: Why did we 
go to Afghanistan in the first place and 
has that been accomplished, the answer 
is, we went to remove the Taliban from 
the leadership there so they would not 
allow al-Qaida to thrive. Al-Qaida is 
decimated; Osama bin Laden is dead; 
and the Taliban have been removed 
from power. 
Now, is everything perfect in Afghan-
istan? Far from it. The goal was not 
peace and daisies when we left. The 
goal was to accomplish what we chose 
to accomplish, to establish a func-
tioning government so they would not 
have to go back to the Taliban, and 
then to leave. 
The President’s team has been nego-
tiating an agreement with the leader-
ship of the Taliban and with the leader-
ship of Afghanistan to determine: Can 
we begin the process of a peaceful tran-
sition out? That conversation has gone 
on for 2 years. Obviously, the Afghan 
leadership likes our forces to be there. 
It is a stabilizing force for their coun-
try, but we have no intention to re-
main in Afghanistan forever. Our in-
tention is to accomplish what we need 
to accomplish and then to withdraw. 
Now, I think it entirely likely that 
we will have a long-term agreement 
with Afghanistan and to have troops 
remain in the region, much like we do 
in Honduras right now. We are not 
fighting a war in Honduras, but we do 
have a base in Honduras so when there 
are disasters in that area or in order to 
fight 
drug 
trafficking 
that 
comes 
through that area, we have a base of 
operations. 
I am one of those who believes long 
term we should have a base of oper-
ations in Afghanistan. It would be wise 
to do that. What is called ISIS-K or 
ISIS in the Khorasan—they are thriv-
ing in that region, and it would be wise 
for us to keep our eyes on other ter-
rorist organizations that may try to 
rise. 
We have no intention to stay long 
term and forever or to control, man-
age, or be the security forces for the 
Afghan Government. We are the United 
States of America. We have issues we 
want to take care of at home, and we 
want our sons and daughters to live life 
with their sons and daughters. 
Now, in the last 48 hours, since this 
peace treaty, this organization, this re-
duction of hostilities—whatever you 
want to call it—since this has kicked 
into place in the last 40 hours, we 
found out just how fragile things are. 
The Taliban reached out and conducted 
several 
attacks 
at 
some 
security 
checkpoints in Helmand—not against 
our forces but against some Afghan 
forces. 
They actually reached out just yes-
terday and brought a defensive attack 
against the Taliban in that region. It is 
the first violence we have had in 11 
days. We fully expect there will be mo-
ments like that, and there is no expec-
tation that everything is going to be 
perfect when we leave Afghanistan. 
Quite frankly, the United States does 
not operate in every location and ex-
pects there to be peace and harmony in 
every location across the world. That

is not our standard. Right now, in Ven-
ezuela, that government is in great 
chaos, but we don’t have troops on the 
ground trying to manage that situa-
tion. We are diplomatically working to 
engage and bring a peaceful resolution 
to what is happening in Venezuela. We 
are putting aggressive economic sanc-
tions in that place to do what we can 
to help. 
We will continue to stay engaged 
with 
Afghanistan. 
We 
have 
many 
friends there. We have people whom we 
worked with for a very long time, side 
by side. We will stay engaged with Af-
ghanistan, but it is not our intent to 
stay and remain forever. Our sons and 
daughters need the ability to come 
home and live their lives. 
There are folks like Terry Hill— 
Terry Hill, from Kellyville, OK. He en-
listed in the Army in 2003, right in the 
heat of the war with Afghanistan. He 
served as an engineer and then later 
became an officer and a pilot of a heli-
copter. He flew 750 combat missions in 
Afghanistan—750. After 13 years of 
serving in the Army and after some 
very hard landings, including one final 
hard landing for him, Terry came back 
home. He is back home in Oklahoma, 
where he runs the Rapid Application 
Group. It is a 3D printing company. It 
is a really remarkable place. It started 
at his house and has now grown into a 
thriving company, and that 3D printing 
company does some really remarkable 
work for a lot of great customers. He 
hires a lot of veterans. He loves to hire 
other veterans, in fact, and knows the 
unique needs and issues there. 
Every Friday, Terry and a whole 
bunch of others across the area and all 
the folks there all will wear shirts— 
what they call RAGFriday. It is to rec-
ognize and bring awareness to veteran 
suicide because he has way too many 
friends he wishes he had back. 
Terry is one of the 775,000 people who 
served in Afghanistan from the United 
States. We are glad to have Terry 
home. We are proud of his company and 
what he is doing and the leadership 
they have. We are proud of his contin-
ued engagement in the veterans com-
munity, continuing to make a dif-
ference. 
We want all of these folks to be able 
to come home and to be our neighbors 
again and for us to hang out with 
them. So in the days ahead, I look for-
ward to a peaceful resolution and, after 
winning this war in Afghanistan, to be 
able to come home, to have continued 
diplomatic 
engagement 
with 
them, 
with a small military footprint, just to 
be able to help them in the region when 
needed. 
I am grateful that we are directing 
our Nation and directing our military 
toward home. I could not be more 
grateful for folks like Terry and the 
775,000 others who have done every-
thing their country has asked them to 
do—to push back on al-Qaida and their 
ruthless attacks on the United States 
and to make sure that that does not 
happen again. I am proud of them for 
what they did. 
Our family lives in safety and free-
dom, and millions of Americans live in 
gratitude because of those 775,000 folks 
who went there to keep the war from 
coming here again. 
With that, I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING BOBBY MILLER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont 
has lost one of the finest people we 
have had in our State. Bobby Miller 
epitomized the very best of Vermont 
ideals, from his childhood straight 
through all that he accomplished in 
our State. Throughout it all, he and his 
lovely wife Holly were a constant, 
quiet source of giving. The Millers 
have always prioritized Vermont com-
munities, never losing sight of their 
humble upbringings and never expect-
ing praise for their philanthropy, even 
when they most deserved it. I know 
Marcelle 
and 
I 
join 
with 
all 
Vermonters in mourning the passing of 
Bobby Miller. Our hearts go out to 
Holly and their family. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ar-
ticle, ‘‘Developer and Philanthropist 
Robert ‘Bobby’ Miller Dies at 84,’’ 
originally published by ‘‘Seven Days,’’ 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Seven Days, Feb. 5, 2020] 
DEVELOPER AND PHILANTHROPIST ROBERT 
‘BOBBY’ MILLER DIES AT 84 
Vermont lost one of its most generous— 
and colorful—philanthropists on Tuesday, 
February 4, when developer Robert ‘‘Bobby’’ 
Miller died of a heart attack, at the age of 
84. 
A self-made man who grew up dirt poor in 
Rutland, Miller gave away millions to 
Vermont nonprofits in cash donations and 
in-kind work through his company, REM De-
velopment. He and his wife, Holly, who sur-
vives him, contributed to the King Street 
Center, Champlain College, the Visiting 
Nurse Association, the VNA Respite House, 
Flynn Center for the Performing Arts and 
many other local organizations. Their 2013 
contribution to the University of Vermont 
Medical Center was valued at $13 million. 
Miller invented himself. With just a high 
school education, and a winning combination 
of charm and audacity, he worked his way up 
through the building industry in Vermont. 
Despite losing an arm at birth, he became an 
auto mechanic, then convinced a Burlington 
engineering firm to hire him as a draftsman. 
After learning on the job, he started New 
England Air Systems in 1972. Twelve years 
later, he sold the business to his employees. 
‘‘It gets companies spread out to people who 
would never own them,’’ he told me when I 
profiled the Millers 20 years ago in Seven 
Days. He started REM Development in 1984. 
Although it is based in Chittenden County, 
the company also built, bought and rehabbed 
properties in downtown Newport and Rut-
land. 
Despite his financial success, Miller was 
not a typical businessman. He preferred 
verbal agreements to written ones and en-
gaged in all manner of creative financing to 
spark economic development. He happily 
rented office space to Seven Days when the 
paper started in 1995—a windowless room in 
the basement of his building, Miller’s Land-
mark, at the top of Burlington’s Church 
Street. He suggested we pay $300 a month for 
the first year and, if Seven Days were still in 
business at the end of it, we could pay him 
the difference between that sum and the real 
rent—aka a balloon payment. 
(At the request of Mr. MCCONNELL, 
the following statement was ordered to

BUDGET ENFORCEMENT LEVELS 
FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 
∑ Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, section 251 
of the Balanced Budget and Emergency 
Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, 
establishes statutory limits on discre-
tionary spending and allows for various 
adjustments to those limits. In addi-
tion, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Con-
gressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the 
chairman of the Budget Committee to 
establish and make revisions to alloca-
tions, aggregates, and levels consistent 
with those adjustments. 
The Senate will soon consider H.R. 
6074, the Coronavirus Preparedness and 
Response Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, 2020. This measure provides sup-
plemental appropriations to support 
activities related to public health and 
response to the coronavirus that qual-
ify for cap adjustments under current 
statute. 
This measure includes $7,767 million 
in budget authority that is designated 
as being for emergency purposes pursu-
ant 
to 
section 
251(b)(2)(A)(i) 
of 
BBEDCA. The entirety of this budget 
authority falls within the revised non-
security category. The Congressional 
Budget Office estimates that these ap-
propriations will result in $1,041 mil-
lion in outlays in fiscal year 2020. 
As a result of the emergency designa-
tions, I am revising the budget author-
ity and outlay allocations to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations by increasing 
revised nonsecurity budget authority 
by $7,767 million and outlays by $1,041 
million in fiscal year 2020. Further, I 
am increasing the budgetary aggregate 
for fiscal year 2020 by equivalent 
amounts. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD.∑

Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I was 
necessarily absent, but had I been

call vote No. 65, the Motion to Table S. 
Amdt. 1506 to H.R. 6074, making emer-

CLIMATE LEGISLATION 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise today to address several proposals 
with significant consequences for our 
environment that have come before the 
Senate this Congress. In particular, I 
would like to express my support for 
the joint resolution of disapproval con-
cerning the Environmental Protection 
Agency’s regulations to reverse the 
Obama administration’s Clean Power 
Plan rules and my opposition to two 
amendments to weaken existing pro-
tections for public lands. 
I am dedicated to promoting policies 
that address the urgent climate crisis. 
We cannot wait 50 or 100 years to ad-
dress the climate impacts that threat-
en the livelihoods of our farmers, our 
businesses, our infrastructure, and our 
national security. It is for that reason 
that I oppose the administration’s ef-
forts to overturn, roll back, and weak-
en the Clean Power Plan rules, and I 
cosponsored S.J. Res. 53, a joint resolu-
tion providing for the disapproval of 
the regulations submitted by the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency to repeal 
the 
Obama 
administration’s 
Clean 
Power Plan rules. In order to fully ad-
dress our urgent climate crisis, the 
Clean Power Plan rules must be rein-
stated and strengthened. 
It is also our responsibility to pre-
serve our natural resources and pass 
them on to future generations through 
responsible conservation and smart 
policies that allow outdoor recreation 
to thrive. This Congress, the Senate 
has considered proposals—which I op-
pose—to reduce, diminish, or eliminate 
protections for existing national monu-
ments and to prevent the use of funds 
from the Land and Water Conservation 
Fund for land acquisition. These pro-
posals would weaken the core mission 
of two critical conservation programs 
that preserve our natural resources. 
I have voted against similar pro-
posals that would undermine the An-
tiquities Act or the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund when they have 
been considered as amendments to 
comprehensive public lands bills be-
cause I believe that we need to do more 
to protect and conserve our public 
lands. I have also cosponsored Senator 
UDALL’s legislation to reinforce exist-
ing law on the establishment of na-
tional 
monuments 
and 
Senator 
MANCHIN’s bill to provide full, perma-
nent funding for the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund.

TUSKEGEE AIRMEN DAY 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of the inaugural 
Tuskegee Airmen Day to be held annu-
ally on March 7 in the State of Ala-
bama, marking the anniversary of the 
first graduating class of Tuskegee Air-
men in Tuskegee, AL. After decades of 
being barred from flying for the U.S. 
military, on March 19, 1941, the U.S. 
Department of War created the all Af-
rican-American 99th Pursuit Squadron 
in Tuskegee, AL. Upon completing 1,600 
missions, destroying over 250 aircraft, 
and laying the foundation for President 
Harry S. Truman to desegregate the 
U.S. military in 1948, this courageous, 
boundary-breaking group of 13 African- 
American men would go on to be 
known simply as the Tuskegee Airmen. 
Recently, the President signed H.R. 
2500, the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2020, which ap-
proves the honorary promotion of Doc-
umented Original Tuskegee Airman, 
U.S. 
Air 
Force 
Colonel 
(retired) 
Charles E. McGee, to brigadier general. 
I believe it is a well-deserved pro-
motion for a hero the likes of General 
McGee. It is my honor to commend and 
recognize General McGee, who is one of 
the last surviving members of the 
Tuskegee Airmen. 
Less than a year after the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor, General McGee 
enlisted in the Army Air Forces on Oc-
tober 26, 1942. He went on to become 
one of the first pilots to graduate from 
the experimental Tuskegee Institute in 
June 1943. General McGee also has the 
distinction of flying more combat mis-
sions in World War II, Korea, and Viet-
nam than any other Air Force pilot. 
Brigadier General Charles McGee will 
be in attendance at the inaugural 
Tuskegee Airmen Day ceremony in 
Alabama this year. 
For over half century, the courage, 
tenacity, and grit of General McGee 
and all of his fellow Tuskegee Airmen 
have been a source of hope and inspira-
tion for generations of Americans. I 
congratulate the city of Tuskegee and 
the State of Alabama for recognizing 
such 
a 
distinguished 
group 
of 
servicemembers who helped change the 
course of our Nation’s history.

GAME CHANGERS STUDY 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I recently 
had the honor of being welcomed by 
Game Changers, an organization based 
in Louisville, KY, devoted to guiding 
our 
youth 
toward 
productive 
and 
meaningful lives, for a panel discussion 
on the impact of violence in our com-
munity. The executive director of 
Game Changers is Christopher 2X, 
whom I have known for many years 
and watched change the lives of so 
many Kentuckians through his advo-
cacy, leadership, and community build-
ing efforts. In December of 2019, just a 
few months ago, Christopher showed 
me the findings of Game Changers’s 
study on the impact of youth violence 
recently released by his organization. 
Subsequently, I asked him to organize

Earnestine ‘‘Tina’’ Tyus described how 
the ongoing physical and the mental

Wood started failing out of school, 
treating those around him poorly, and 
had trouble sleeping at night. This 
downward spiral was a result of wit-
nessing the murders of his mother and 
older brother. Jarron Jones, a behav-
ioral therapist, recounts a story of how 
a once-promising baseball career for 
one student may now never come to 
fruition because he is too afraid of vio-
lence to continue playing the sport. 
Only personal stories such as these 
truly demonstrate the extreme toll 
taken on children exposed to violence. 
That is why I feel compelled to share 
Game Changers’s findings on violence 
and its impact on our youth with my 
colleagues. Tragically, children are ex-
posed to violence in every corner of our 
Nation. I ask unanimous consent that 
this report be printed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL
RECORD
with the hope that 
every Member of Congress will read it 
and work with me to create safer com-
munities for our children. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
VIOLENCE IMPACT ON CHILDREN LEARNING 
The Christopher 2X Game Changers Target 
Education—Crush Violence 
KI’ANTHONY TYUS AND HIS GRANDMOTHER 
ERNESTINE ‘‘TINA’’ TYUS 
Tina Tyus has a comfortable home in West 
Louisville where photos of grandchildren she 
has raised are on display or within easy 
reach. 
There’s Ki’Anthony as an infant along with 
one of the last pictures of him, at the fam-
ily’s Thanksgiving gathering last year, a 
lanky teenager smiling next to a proud 
grandmother who ‘‘had him since he came 
into this world.’’ 
Their world, from the time Ki’Anthony 
was 9, has been devastated by gun violence. 
At age 9, Ki’Anthony was shot by a stray 
bullet while playing basketball in a park and 
suffered a debilitating leg injury. Four years 
later, on Dec. 22, 2018, he died when the sto-
len Lexus SUV he was riding in crashed into 
a utility pole on Fern Valley Road after a 
police chase. Four other juveniles in the car 
including the driver survived. 
His family is grabbling with the cir-
cumstances of his death and does not under-
stand how or why he ended up in the stolen 
car. 
Known as ‘‘Lil King,’’ playful and fun to be 
around, Ki’Anthony was a symbol of resil-
ience in a media spotlight during anti-vio-
lence efforts after he was shot. He was an ac-
tive 
participant 
in 
a 
Christopher 
2X 
‘‘Hood2Hood’’ antiviolence movement. He 
visited other gunshot victims in the hospital 
to offer encouragement and comfort. 
He also struggled with his wounds, both 
emotional 
and 
physical, 
and 
navigated 
among peers who were not always good influ-
ences. 
His gun shot injury put him in the hospital 
for several days. He had multiple surgeries in 
the aftermath followed by months of phys-
ical therapy. He had a rod in his leg for a 
year and a bullet was left there permanently 
because of the damage it could cause if it 
was removed. 
The boy who loved to play football and 
basketball ‘‘wasn’t able to play any sport 
and that devastated him. He had to basically 
start all over again walking,’’ his grand-
mother said. He was ‘‘angry, very angry.’’ 
He began disobeying rules in her home, and 
feared getting shot again, she said. His 
grades suffered, and she said a contributing 
factor was his assignment to a middle school 
far away from home that required a long 
commute on two buses each morning and 
afternoon while he was using a walker be-
cause of his leg injury. He acted out, she 
said, so he could be sent to another school. 
His two sisters—11 and 16—also have been 
impacted. Neither are doing well in school, 
and ‘‘they are just hurt,’’ she said. 
A happy time was last Thanksgiving, a few 
weeks before Ki’Anthony died, and she had 
made his favorite foods including a straw-
berry cake for the large annual family gath-
ering in her home. ‘‘He was jumping around 
here, dancing.’’ 
At Thanksgiving, she told Ki’Anthony she 
would buy him a purple suit for Easter like 
the ones he saw and admired at a gospel pro-
gram they had attended, ‘‘not knowing I had 
to bury him before Easter. He died on my 
mother’s birthday. It just eats me up.’’ 
385—Number of people shot in Louisville in 
2017, an average of 32 people each month. 
355—Number of people shot in Louisville in 
2018, an average of nearly 30 people each 
month. 
276—Number of people shot in Louisville in 
the first nine months of 2019, an average of 
more than 30 people a month. 
JAMIE DENTON WITH HER SON ROBERT 
LEACHMAN 
Jamie Denton chokes up talking about the 
impact her son’s violent death has had on his 
three younger brothers and how she’s strug-
gled. 
Robert Leachman, 20, died on Aug. 2, 2017, 
from multiple gunshot wounds at Parkway 
Place Apartments two weeks before he was 
to start nursing school. The family believes 
the shooting stemmed from an earlier argu-
ment on a basketball court. 
Jamie’s three other sons, who were 9, 11 
and 16 at the time, were close to their broth-
er and their behaviors all changed in dif-
ferent ways after his death. 
‘‘It took something out of them,’’ she said. 
Before the death of their brother, they 
were good students with good grades, she 
said. Afterward, her 16–year-old ‘‘shut him-
self off and didn’t go out, was scared to take 
TARC and had to have a ride with someone 
to go anywhere. He no longer wanted to at-
tend Ballard and instead now attends Jeffer-
son County High School. 
The 11–year-old became out of control in 
school, not listening, but now is doing bet-
ter, she said. The 9–year-old withdrew but 
also began writing rap songs about his broth-
er and at the end of the school year he chose 
the topic ‘‘Stop the Violence’’ for a project. 
She and her children have all had coun-
seling and their public schools have been 
helpful but her children ‘‘are hurt and 
stressed and looking at me, they see more 
stress because they are worrying about me,’’ 
she said. 
They moved after the shooting, she said, 
and now feel safe in their neighborhood but 
not safe enough to visit a nearby park. Her 
older son warned her to stop walking in the 
park because of a gang that frequents there. 
‘‘So, I don’t go to that park,’’ she said. 
A few weeks after her son was killed, when 
she was still in her old home on Madison 
Street north of Broadway, during a neighbor-
hood cookout on Labor Day weekend, shoot-
ers fired bullets at homes including hers and 
shot up cars. ‘‘We were terrified,’’ she said. 
‘‘I switched up my house and I switched up 
my car. I had to, to survive.’’ 
In the aftermath of her son’s death, her 
health declined, and she suffered a heart at-
tack at age 39 last spring. 
‘‘Kids will keep you strong because they 
know what you’re going through. They want 
to see you the same.’’ 
Murders from gun fire are a ‘‘totally dif-
ferent’’ level of dying than by other means. 
‘‘It’s the cruelest thing, that a person can die 
of that.’’ 
1,616—Number of times in the first six 
months of 2019 that an electronic gunfire de-
tection system alerted police to shots fired 
in an area totaling six square miles, an aver-
age of nine times a day, 269 times a month. 
The system called Shotspotter operates in 
parts of the 1st, 2nd and 4th police districts 
in West Louisville, and Smoketown and Old 
Louisville just east and south of downtown. 
STEVONTE WOOD 
Stevonte Wood, 23, earned a college degree 
in three years, has a fulltime job as a secu-
rity officer, and is recently married—a 
happy, fulfilling life that was highly un-
likely 10 years ago. 
Stevonte was 13 when he witnessed a hor-
rendous act of violence, the shooting deaths 
of his mother and older brother after an ar-
gument on a basketball court at his family’s 
Shively apartment complex. After that ter-
rible day, for Stevonte, ‘‘things really took a 
turn.’’ 
He was on a grieving, trauma-filled down-
ward spiral marked by anger, bad conduct 
and failing grades. Family support, coun-
seling, caring teachers, others in his life— 
and his own hard work and determination— 
helped Stevonte rebound. 
Before the shootings, he had been a good 
student, making A’s and Bs, which he cred-
ited in part to his mother who ‘‘made me 
book heavy.’’ His father worked long days, 
taking two buses to and from their home to 
his construction job. 
After the shootings, Stevonte was deeply 
troubled and struggling. He was still living 
in the apartment where his mother and 
brother were killed, and he had trouble fo-
cusing and sleeping. When he did sleep he 
often had nightmares. He argued with his fa-
ther, who had been injured in the shootings 
and was grieving. (They now have a close re-
lationship). 
Angry and withdrawn, he failed 9th grade. 
He went to school but had trouble concen-
trating. ‘‘I was there but I wasn’t there. I 
was constantly thinking about what hap-
pened.’’ He wanted to communicate but he 
said he didn’t know how; his words were 
angry, and he said he felt ‘‘a lot of self-ha-
tred.’’ He worried about his father’s safety 
and that someone might retaliate against his 
family in another act of violence. 
From Butler High School he was sent to 
Western High School to repeat 9th grade, 
which turned out to be blessing, he said. 
Counseling helped him manage his grief, 
overcome his anger and detachment so he 
could focus on schoolwork, he said, and 
teachers encouraged him while holding him 
responsible. A turning point came when one 
told him he didn’t want to fail the same 
grade twice, that would ‘‘not be good, trust 
me.’’ 
‘‘I started listening in class, participating 
and my grades climbed up.’’

He was motivated to make up for failing at 
Butler. ‘‘The people I was surrounded by 
were well-rounded people. Once I put myself 
around people who wanted me to succeed, 
that was one heck of an opportunity. I didn’t 
want to miss out on it.’’ 
With good grades, he pursued advanced 
placement classes in his junior year at West-
ern and started racking up college credits 
through courses taught through Jefferson 
Community 
Technical 
College. 
When 
Stevonte received his high school diploma in 
2015 he had 31 college credits toward his de-
gree from the University of Louisville, which 
he earned in 2018. 
His decision to major in criminal justice 
was influenced by the good relations he had 
with police officers after his mother and 
brother were murdered. ‘‘I began to idolize 
the good police and those who interact with 
the community,’’ he said. Police were kind 
to his family and checked on them, he said, 
and he thought he could be like them and 
help people. 
He has shared his story with other sur-
vivors of gun violence to offer hope and en-
courages awareness of the signs of trauma in 
children. 
Anger, withdrawal, depression are key 
signs, he said. Schools and parents also need 
to be connected. ‘‘When you get that dis-
connect, that’s when you start losing kids. 
We need to find who these kids are and take 
the time to understand their situation and 
help them to the best of our abilities.’’ 
4,558—Number of times citizens reported 
hearing gunfire to Louisville Metro Police in 
18 months, from Jan., 2018–June, 2019, over 
200 times a month. 
JERRON JONES—LICENSED PROFESSIONAL 
COUNSELOR ASSOCIATE 
As a behavioral therapist, Jerron Jones 
spends much of his time trying to help fami-
lies and children suffering from trauma re-
sulting from exposure to violence. 
The symptoms of trauma in children vary 
based on age and the individual child but a 
‘‘huge sign’’ is an inability to develop a rela-
tionship with an adult and show respect for 
the teacher, Jones said. Children in those 
situations, he said, often lack a consistent, 
nurturing adult in their lives. 
A lot of kids lack confidence and self-es-
teem and don’t hear encouraging words or 
praise for what they do well and the 
strengths they have, he said, and ‘‘that 
leaves them without a skill set to build on.’’ 
Jones advises adults in their lives to cele-
brate them with compliments and praise for 
their efforts. Children should also be com-
forted by adults who remain calm and pa-
tient even though the circumstances can be 
difficult, he said. Listening to them and 
showing an interest in what they like to do, 
he said, as well as working with them and 
sharing new ideas can help them build self- 
esteem. 
Parents and teachers should be aware of 
signs of trauma, and seek help when needed, 
he said, but often parents don’t feel com-
fortable revealing upsetting circumstances 
that may be a root cause of a child’s trauma. 
Building trust and showing integrity, he 
said, goes a long way in addressing a trauma-
tized child’s needs. 
‘‘Early 
exposure 
to 
extremely 
fearful 
events affects the developing brain, particu-
larly in those areas involved in emotions and 
learning. . . . For young children who per-
ceive the world as a threatening place, a 
wide range of conditions can trigger anxious 
behaviors that then impair their ability to 
learn and to interact socially with others.’’ 
Source: National Scientific Council on the 
Developing Child (2010). Persistent Fear and 
Anxiety Can Affect Young Children’s Learn-
ing and Development: Working Paper No. 9. 
Jones cites the following age-related symp-
toms children may have in response to a 
traumatic event or series of events including 
exposure to gun violence: 
Five and under: May be irritable, fussy or 
difficult to get calmed down. They may be 
easily started or show behaviors common in 
younger children such as thumb sucking. 
Clingy behavior and frequent tantrums may 
also be present, and they may talk or act out 
a traumatic event. 
Ages 6–12 may have trouble paying atten-
tion or be withdrawn. Their performance 
may decline in school. They may be in trou-
ble at school or home, fearful, sad or want to 
be left alone. 
Teenagers may refuse to follow rules, talk 
back more often, talk about the event or 
deny it happened, withdraw, engage in risky 
behaviors, change sleeping or eating pat-
terns, have nightmares and may turn to 
drugs or alcohol. 
Professional help should be considered, he 
said, if symptoms persist, get worse or the 
child’s symptom are extreme and unrespon-
sive to attempts to help. 
NYREE CLAYTON-TAYLOR—2019 KENTUCKY 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
Teaching predominately African American 
students in West Louisville, NyRee Clayton- 
Taylor recognized symptoms of suffering— 
anger and lashing out, or withdrawal and not 
doing the work. Kids would tell her about an 
uncle who was shot, a father lost to gun vio-
lence, parents in prison. Some couldn’t find 
words to express themselves. 
So, Clayton-Taylor, a resource teacher at 
Wheatley Elementary School, created a cur-
riculum around their joys in life, their inter-
ests, their culture. Her energy, creativity 
and impact earned her recognition as the 
2919 Kentucky Elementary School Teacher of 
the Year. 
‘‘Academics will not happen if a student is 
not healed,’’ she said. ‘‘I decided to infuse 
academics with healing so they could get it 
at one time.’’ 
Her solution was to use hip hop, the pop-
ular music genre especially among African 
American youth, as a primary teaching tool, 
along with rap, graffiti artwork, and books 
about African American history and culture 
to help children focus, write, create, work in 
teams, and solve problems, all beneficial life-
long skills. 
‘‘I had to bring in hip hop. It was a must 
so that they could have a narrative that was 
their own,’’ said Clayton-Taylor, now in her 
20th year of teaching. 
In a nationally represented survey, 8.2 per-
cent of all children, from age 2–17, were re-
ported to have witnessed gun violence or 
heard gunshots in their communities. Youth 
ages 14–17 had the highest exposure at nearly 
17 percent. Source: Finkelhor D, Turner HA,

REMEMBERING LAWRENCE 
HAMMOND 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. President, today I 
wish to honor the life and legacy of 
Lawrence ‘‘Larry’’ Hammond, a tire-
less advocate for justice who passed 
away in Phoenix, AZ, on March 2, 2020. 
Larry was a respected attorney and the 
senior partner of the investigation and 
criminal 
defense 
group 
at 
Osborn 
Maledon in Phoenix. Throughout his 
career, he worked to defend the wrong-
ly accused and marginalized. 
Larry founded the Arizona Justice 
Project in 1998 while he was a member 
of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Jus-
tice. The organization focuses on rep-
resenting indigent Arizona inmates 
whose claims of innocence or manifest 
injustice have gone unheeded. Under 
Larry’s leadership, AJP has received 
over 6,000 requests for assistance and 
currently handles 40 to 50 cases in post- 
conviction proceedings. 
Larry’s legal career was legendary. 
After earning his juris doctor at the 
University of Texas, he served as clerk 
to Judge Carl E. McGowan of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, as 
well as Supreme Court Justices Hugo 
Black and Lewis Powell, Jr. In the 
1970s, he represented the NAACP in 
their effort to desegregate Tucson 
schools. He was also a special pros-
ecutor during Watergate and helped ne-
gotiate the release of American hos-
tages in Iran while he served as a first 
deputy attorney general in the Office 
of Legal Counsel. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
Larry 
received 
many prestigious awards throughout 
his career, including the Department of 
Justice’s Exceptional Service Award in 
1980 and the American Inns of Court in 
2013. He was inducted into the Amer-
ican College of Trial Lawyers in 2013. 
I had the honor of meeting Larry 
when I was a law student at Arizona 
Student University and worked with 
the Arizona Justice Project. Larry was 
a generous mentor, a studious re-
searcher, and a fierce defender of the 
Constitution. I will miss him dearly. 
Larry is survived by his wife Frances, 
their children, Brooke, Blake, and 
Amanda, and nine grandchildren. He 
will be missed by other family mem-
bers, friends, and the entire Arizona 
legal community. Please join me in 
honoring his memory.

from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing,

Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency declared in Executive 
Order 13692 of March 8, 2015, with re-
spect to the situation in Venezuela is 
to continue in effect beyond March 8, 
2020. 
The situation in Venezuela continues 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. For 
this reason, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13692 with respect to the situation in

RESOLUTION 
531—HON-
ORING LAS DAMAS DE BLANCO, 
A 
WOMEN-LED 
NONVIOLENT 
MOVEMENT 
IN 
SUPPORT 
OF 
FREEDOM AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
IN CUBA, AND CALLING FOR THE 
RELEASE 
OF 
ALL 
POLITICAL 
PRISONERS IN CUBA 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. CARDIN, and Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 531 
Whereas Las Damas de Blanco (also known 
as the ‘‘Ladies in White’’) is a group com-
posed of wives and relatives of political pris-
oners, prisoners of conscience, and peaceful 
dissidents in Cuba; 
Whereas, in April 2003, during the wave of 
repression known as the ‘‘Black Spring’’, a 
group of strong and courageous women 
formed Las Damas de Blanco in response to 
the wrongful imprisonment of their family 
members by the Cuban regime; 
Whereas members of Las Damas de Blanco 
continue attempting to attend Sunday mass 
in the Church of Santa Rita de Casia in Ha-
vana, and other churches throughout dif-
ferent provinces in Cuba, and then march 
peacefully through the streets of Havana 
holding gladiolus despite the Cuban regime’s 
constant efforts to block their nonviolent ex-
ercise of freedom of assembly and speech; 
Whereas members of Las Damas de Blanco 
regularly march to advocate for the release 
of all political prisoners and the freedom of 
the Cuban people; 
Whereas, despite exercising their funda-
mental rights to freedom of expression and 
assembly, members of Las Damas de Blanco 
are regularly attacked by security forces and 
mobs organized by the Cuban regime; 
Whereas, according to Amnesty Inter-
national— 
(1) Las Damas de Blanco ‘‘remain[s] one of 
the primary targets of repression by Cuban 
[G]overnment authorities’’; and 
(2) members of Las Damas de Blanco are 
frequently detained and ‘‘often beaten by law 
enforcement officials and state security 
agents dressed as civilians’’ while in deten-
tion; 
Whereas, according to the Human Rights 
Watch 2019 World Report, in Cuba ‘‘detention 
is often used preemptively to prevent people 
from participating in peaceful marches or 
meetings to discuss politics, and detainees 
are often beaten, threatened, and held in-
communicado for hours or days’’; 
Whereas the Human Rights Watch 2019 
World Report noted that ‘‘Cuban Police or 
state security agents continue to routinely 
harass, rough up, and detain members of Las 
Damas de Blanco before or after they attend 
Sunday mass’’; 
Whereas, in 2005, Las Damas de Blanco 
were selected to receive the Sakharov Prize 
for Freedom of Thought, but the Cuban re-
gime did not allow members of the group to 
leave the island to accept the award; 
Whereas Laura Ines Polla´n Toledo, the 
founder of Las Damas de Blanco, left a leg-
acy of peaceful protest against human and 
civil rights abuses in Cuba; 
Whereas Laura Ines Polla´n Toledo died on 
October 14, 2011, and while her death gar-
nered widespread international attention, 
the Cuban regime remained silent; 
Whereas, in February 2015, 30 members of 
Las Damas de Blanco were arrested in an at-
tempt by Cuban officials to bar the women 
from participating in marches, which sought 
to advocate for the freedom of political pris-
oners in Cuba; 
Whereas, while Rau´ l Castro is no longer 
the head of Cuba, grave human rights abuses 
continue under the current President of 
Cuba, Miguel Dı´az-Canel; 
Whereas Las Damas de Blanco has ap-
pealed to the United States Government and 
other foreign governments in order to bring 
international attention to the repression of 
dissidents by the Cuban regime and the 
plight of political prisoners, who are rou-
tinely jailed unjustly and without due proc-
ess; 
Whereas, on May 17, 2018, Las Damas de 
Blanco received the prestigious 2018 Milton 
Friedman Prize for Advancing Liberty for 
the bravery of the group and the continuing 
efforts of the group to fight for individual 
freedom in Cuba; 
Whereas 
Berta 
de 
los 
Angeles 
Soler 
Ferna´ndez and Leticia Ramos Herreria, 
members of Las Damas de Blanco, were pro-
hibited by the Dı´az-Canel regime from leav-
ing Cuba to accept the 2018 Milton Friedman 
Prize for Advancing Liberty in the United 
States; 
Whereas, on May 6, 2018, Avmara Nieto 
Mun˜ oz, a member of the Damas de Blanco, 
was violently arrested and during her trans-
fer in a patrol car, a uniformed cop beat her, 
causing Nieto to require medical attention; 
Whereas, following 10 days of confinement 
in a cell of the Santiago de las Vegas-La 
Habana, Aymara Nieto Mun˜ oz was trans-
ferred to Havana’s women’s prison, known as 
the Guatao, and remains detained pending a 
trial for an alleged ‘‘crime of attack’’ with 
other prisoners arrested for petty crimes; 
Whereas it is the second time that Aymara 
Nieto Mun˜ oz, has been imprisoned for polit-
ical reasons, and during a politically charged 
trial on June 3, 2017, she was sentenced to 
one year of prison for an alleged crime of 
public disorder; 
Whereas, in March 2018, Marta Sa´nchez 
Gonza´lez was arrested for peacefully pro-
testing and transferred to a women’s prison 
a month later; 
Whereas, on August 2018, Marta Sa´nchez 
Gonza´lez faced a rigged trial and was sen-
tenced to 4 years and 6 months of imprison-
ment 
alongside 
prisoners 
for 
common 
crimes; 
Whereas, throughout 2019, Las Damas de 
Blanco experienced countless arrests, acts of 
repression, and violent attacks intended to 
imperil their physical and mental state as a 
result of their peaceful advocacy of the re-
lease of all political prisoners; 
Whereas the total number of arrests in 2019 
conducted by the Cuban Police against Las 
Damas de Blanco is 1,120, including those of 
Berta Soler Ferna´ndez, who has been con-
stantly harassed, violently attacked, and de-
tained for lengthy periods of time, and 
Xiomara de las Mercedes Cruz Miranda, who 
was imprisoned in 2018; 
Whereas, upon entering prison the first 
time on April 15, 2016, Ms. Cruz Miranda was 
in good health, but after being sent to prison 
for the second time in 2018, she acquired a 
rare skin disease in the women’s prison in 
Ciego de A´ vila and her health began to be af-
fected by several conditions, including tuber-
culosis, which severely damaged her res-
piratory system and her mental and physical 
health; and 
Whereas Ms. Cruz Miranda remained hos-
pitalized for more than 6 months in Cuba, 
and after her health condition failed to sta-
bilize, she was admitted to Jackson South 
Hospital in the City of Miami on January 
2020, thanks to a humanitarian visa granted 
by the United States Government: Now, 
therefore, be it: 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) honors the courageous members of Las 
Damas de Blanco for their peaceful efforts to 
speak up for the voiceless and stand up to 
the Cuban regime in defense of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, such as freedom 
of expression and assembly; 
(2) recognizes the brave leaders of Las 
Damas de Blanco, including Marta Sa´nchez 
and Aymara Nieto Mun˜ oz, who are currently 
in prison due to their peaceful activism; 
(3) expresses solidarity with the Cuban peo-
ple and a commitment to the democratic as-
pirations of those Cubans calling for a free 
Cuba; 
(4) calls on the Cuban regime to allow 
members of Las Damas de Blanco to attend 
weekly masses and travel freely both domes-
tically and internationally; and 
(5) calls for the release of all political pris-
oners detained and imprisoned by the Cuban 
regime.

CRAMER, Mr. SASSE, Ms. ERNST, Mr. 
LEE, Mr. CRUZ, Mr. PERDUE, Mr. SCOTT 
of South Carolina, Mr. INHOFE, and Ms. 
MCSALLY) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the Se-
lect Committee on Ethics: 
S. RES. 532 
Whereas the Senator from New York, Mr. 
Schumer, is the Leader of the Democratic 
Caucus and a former member of the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary of the Senate; 
Whereas, at a protest at the Supreme 
Court of the United States on March 4, 2020, 
Senator Schumer inveighed against 2 Asso-
ciate Justices of the Supreme Court of the 
United States by saying, ‘‘I want to tell you, 
Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you 
have release the whirlwind, and you will pay 
the price.’’; 
Whereas Senator Schumer went on to warn 
Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh, 
‘‘You won’t know what hit you if you go for-
ward with these awful decisions.’’; 
Whereas the statements of Senator Schu-
mer are an attempt to unduly influence the 
judicial decisions of the Supreme Court of 
the United States and to undermine the vi-
sion of the founders of the United States of 
the ‘‘complete independence of the courts of 
justice’’, as Alexander Hamilton wrote in 
Federalist No. 78; 
Whereas the statements of Senator Schu-
mer could be read to suggest a threat or call 
for physical violence against 2 Associate Jus-
tices of the Supreme Court of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Chief Justice of the United 
States immediately rebuked Senator Schu-
mer, stating that ‘‘threatening statements of 
this sort from the highest levels of govern-
ment are not only inappropriate, they are 
dangerous’’; 
Whereas, according to the Institute for Ec-
onomics and Peace, political violence in the 
United States has increased over the last 
decade; 
Whereas, in 2018, the United States Mar-
shals Service investigated 4,542 threats and 
inappropriate communications against the 
judiciary; 
Whereas 4 Federal judges have been tar-
geted and murdered since 1979 and 2 family 
members of another Federal judge have been 
murdered; and

Whereas Senator Schumer has acknowl-
edged that threatening statements can in-
crease the dangers of violence against gov-
ernment officials when he stated on June 15, 
2017, following the attempted murder of sev-
eral elected Members of Congress, ‘‘We would 
all be wise to reflect on the importance of ci-
vility in our [N]ation’s politics’’ and that 
‘‘the level of nastiness, vitriol, and hate that 
has 
seeped 
into 
our 
politics 
must 
be 
excised’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) censures and condemns in the strongest 
possible terms the Senator from New York, 
Mr. Schumer, for his threatening statements 
against Associate Justice Neil M. Gorsuch 
and Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh; 
and 
(2) calls on all members of the Senate to 
respect the independence of the Federal judi-
ciary. 
f 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
533—SUP-
PORTING THE GOALS OF INTER-
NATIONAL WOMEN’S DAY 
Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mr. MURPHY, and Ms. BALDWIN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 533 
Whereas, as of March 2020, there are ap-
proximately 3,764,000,000 women and girls in 
the world; 
Whereas women and girls around the 
world— 
(1) have fundamental human rights; 
(2) play a critical role in providing and car-
ing for their families and driving positive 
change in their communities; 
(3) contribute substantially to food secu-
rity, economic growth, the prevention and 
resolution of conflict, and the sustainability 
of peace and stability; and 
(4) must have meaningful opportunities to 
more fully participate in and lead the polit-
ical, social, and economic lives of their com-
munities; 
Whereas the advancement and empower-
ment of women and girls around the world is 
a foreign policy priority for the United 
States and is critical to the achievement of 
global peace and prosperity; 
Whereas 2020 marks the anniversary of sig-
nificant milestones toward advancing the 
human rights and equality of women and 
girls, including— 
(1) the 100th anniversary of women’s suf-
frage in the United States; and 
(2) the 20th anniversary of the Women, 
Peace, and Security Agenda, which was es-
tablished through the unanimous adoption of 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1325 in October 2000; 
Whereas the National Security Strategy of 
the United States, published in December 
2017— 
(1) declares that ‘‘[s]ocieties that empower 
women to participate fully in civic and eco-
nomic life are more prosperous and peace-
ful’’; 
(2) supports ‘‘efforts to advance women’s 
equality, protect the rights of women and 
girls, and promote women and youth em-
powerment programs’’; and 
(3) recognizes that ‘‘governments that fail 
to treat women equally do not allow their 
societies to reach their potential’’; 
Whereas, on October 6, 2017, the Women, 
Peace, and Security Act of 2017 (22 U.S.C. 
2152j et seq.) was enacted into law, which in-
cludes requirements for a government-wide 
‘‘Women, Peace, and Security Strategy’’ to 
promote and strengthen the participation of 
women in peace negotiations and conflict 
prevention overseas, enhanced training for 
relevant United States Government per-
sonnel, and follow-up evaluations of the ef-
fectiveness of the strategy; 
Whereas the United States Strategy on 
Women, Peace, and Security, dated June 
2019, recognizes that— 
(1) 
the 
‘‘[s]ocial 
and 
political 
marginalization of women strongly cor-
relates with the likelihood that a country 
will experience conflict’’; 
(2) there is a ‘‘tremendous amount of un-
tapped potential among the world’s women 
and girls to identify, recommend, and imple-
ment effective solutions to conflict’’, and 
there are ‘‘benefits derived from creating op-
portunities for women and girls to serve as 
agents of peace via political, economic, and 
social empowerment’’; and 
(3) barriers to the meaningful participation 
of women and girls in conflict prevention 
and resolution efforts ‘‘include under-rep-
resentation in political leadership, pervasive 
violence against women and girls, and per-
sistent inequality in many societies’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Em-
powerment of Women (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘UN Women’’), peace negotiations are 
more likely to end in a peace agreement 
when women and women’s groups play a 
meaningful role in the negotiation process; 
Whereas, according to a study by the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement 
is 35 percent more likely to last at least 15 
years if women participate in the develop-
ment of the peace agreement; 
Whereas there are 83 national action plans 
relating to the empowerment of women 
around the world, 11 regional action plans, 
and at least 9 additional national action 
plans in development; 
Whereas the joint strategy of the Depart-
ment of State and the United States Agency 
for International Development (USAID) enti-
tled ‘‘Department of State & USAID Joint 
Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism’’ 
and dated May 2016— 
(1) notes that women can play a critical 
role in identifying and addressing drivers of 
violent extremism in their families, commu-
nities, and broader society; and 
(2) commits to supporting programs that 
engage women ‘‘as key stakeholders in pre-
venting and countering violent extremism in 
their communities’’; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Inter-
national Narcotics and Law Enforcement Af-
fairs of the Department of State, the full and 
meaningful participation of women in crimi-
nal justice professions and security forces 
vastly enhances the effectiveness of the secu-
rity forces; 
Whereas, 
despite 
the 
contributions 
of 
women to society, hundreds of millions of 
women and girls around the world continue 
to be denied the right to participate freely in 
civic and economic life, lack fundamental 
legal protections, and remain vulnerable to 
exploitation and abuse; 
Whereas, 
every 
year, 
approximately 
12,000,000 girls are married before they reach 
the age of 18, which means that— 
(1) nearly 33,000 girls are married every 
day; or 
(2) nearly 23 girls are married every 
minute; 
Whereas, despite global progress, it is pre-
dicted that by 2030 more than 150,000,000 
more girls will marry before reaching the 
age of 18, and approximately 2,400,000 girls 
who are married before reaching the age of 18 
are under the age of 15; 
Whereas girls living in countries affected 
by conflict or other humanitarian crises are 
often the most vulnerable to child marriage, 
and 9 of the 10 countries with the highest 
rates of child marriage are considered fragile 
or extremely fragile; 
Whereas, according to the International 
Labour Organization, 71 percent of the esti-
mated 40,300,000 victims of modern slavery in 
2016 were women or girls; 
Whereas, according to the United Nation’s 
Children’s Fund (commonly referred to as 
‘‘UNICEF’’)— 
(1) approximately 1⁄4 of girls between the 
ages of 15 and 19 are victims of physical vio-
lence; 
(2) approximately 120,000,000 girls world-
wide, slightly more than 1 in 10, have experi-
enced forced sexual acts; and 
(3) an estimated 1 in 3 women around the 
world has experienced some form of physical 
or sexual violence; 
Whereas, according to the 2018 report of 
the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime entitled ‘‘Global Report on Traf-
ficking in Persons’’, 72 percent of all de-
tected trafficking victims are women or 
girls; 
Whereas, on August 10, 2012, the United 
States Government launched a strategy enti-
tled ‘‘United States Strategy to Prevent and 
Respond to Gender-Based Violence Glob-
ally’’, which is the first interagency strategy 
that— 
(1) addresses gender-based violence around 
the world; 
(2) advances the rights and status of 
women and girls; 
(3) promotes gender equality in United 
States foreign policy; and 
(4) works to bring about a world in which 
all individuals can pursue their aspirations 
without the threat of violence; 
Whereas, in June 2016, the Department of 
State released an update to that strategy, 
underscoring that ‘‘[p]reventing and respond-
ing to gender-based violence is a cornerstone 
of the U.S. Government’s commitment to ad-
vancing human rights and promoting gender 
equality and the empowerment of women 
and girls’’; 
Whereas, despite the achievements of indi-
vidual female leaders and evidence that de-
mocracy and equality under the law form a 
mutually reinforcing relationship in which 
higher levels of equality are strongly cor-
related with the relative state of peace of a 
country, a healthier domestic security envi-
ronment, and lower levels of aggression to-
ward other countries— 
(1) women around the world remain vastly 
underrepresented in— 
(A) national and local legislatures and 
governments; and 
(B) other high-level positions; and 
(2) according to the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, women account for only 25 percent of 
national parliamentarians and 21 percent of 
government ministers; 
Whereas the ability of women and girls to 
realize their full potential is critical to the 
ability of a country to achieve strong and 
lasting economic growth, self-reliance, and 
political and social stability; 
Whereas the overall level of violence 
against women is a better predictor of the 
peacefulness of a country, the compliance of 
a country with international treaty obliga-
tions, and the relations of a country with 
neighboring countries than indicators meas-
uring the level of democracy, level of wealth, 
or level of institutionalization of the coun-
try; 
Whereas, although the United Nations Mil-
lennium Project reached the goal of achiev-
ing gender parity in primary education in 
most countries in 2015, more work remains 
to be done to achieve gender equality in pri-
mary and secondary education, and particu-
larly in secondary education worldwide as 
gender gaps persist and widen, by address-
ing— 
(1) discriminatory practices; 
(2) harmful cultural and social norms;

(3) inadequate sanitation facilities, includ-
ing facilities to manage menstruation; 
(4) child, early, and forced marriage; 
(5) poverty; 
(6) early pregnancy and motherhood; 
(7) conflict and insecurity; and 
(8) other factors that favor boys or devalue 
girls’ education; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organi-
zation— 
(1) approximately 129,200,000 girls between 
the ages of 6 and 17 remain out of school; 
(2) girls living in countries affected by con-
flict are 2.5 times more likely to be out of 
school than boys; 
(3) girls are twice as likely as boys to never 
set foot in a classroom; and 
(4) up to 30 percent of girls who drop out of 
school do so because of adolescent pregnancy 
or child marriage; 
Whereas women around the world face a 
variety of constraints that severely limit 
their economic participation and produc-
tivity and remain underrepresented in the 
labor force; 
Whereas the economic empowerment of 
women is inextricably linked to a myriad of 
other human rights that are essential to the 
ability of women to thrive as economic ac-
tors, including— 
(1) living lives free of violence and exploi-
tation; 
(2) achieving the highest possible standard 
of health and well-being; 
(3) enjoying full legal and human rights, 
such as access to registration, identification, 
and citizenship documents, and freedom of 
movement; 
(4) access to formal and informal edu-
cation; 
(5) access to, and equal protection under, 
land and property rights; 
(6) access to fundamental labor rights; 
(7) the implementation of policies to ad-
dress disproportionate care burdens; and 
(8) receiving business and management 
skills and leadership opportunities; 
Whereas closing the global gender gap in 
labor markets could increase worldwide 
gross domestic product by as much as 
$28,000,000,000,000 by 2025; 
Whereas, pursuant to section 3(b) of the 
Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic 
Empowerment Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 2151– 
2(b)), it is the international development co-
operation policy of the United States— 
(1) to reduce gender disparities with re-
spect to economic, social, political, edu-
cational, and cultural resources, as well as 
wealth, opportunities, and services; 
(2) to strive to eliminate gender-based vio-
lence and mitigate its harmful effects on in-
dividuals 
and 
communities, 
including 
through efforts to develop standards and ca-
pacity to reduce gender-based violence in the 
workplace and other places where women 
work; 
(3) to support activities that secure private 
property rights and land tenure for women in 
developing countries, including— 
(A) supporting legal frameworks that 
give women equal rights to own, register, 
use, profit from, and inherit land and prop-
erty; 
(B) improving legal literacy to enable 
women to exercise the rights described in 
subparagraph (A); and 
(C) improving the capacity of law en-
forcement and community leaders to en-
force such rights; 
(4) to increase the capability of women and 
girls to fully exercise their rights, determine 
their life outcomes, assume leadership roles, 
and influence decision making in households, 
communities, and societies; and 
(5) to improve the access of women and 
girls to education, particularly higher edu-
cation opportunities in business, finance, 
and management, in order to enhance finan-
cial literacy and business development, man-
agement, and strategy skills; 
Whereas, pursuant to National Security 
Presidential Memorandum 16, entitled ‘‘Pro-
moting Women’s Global Development and 
Prosperity’’, ‘‘It is the policy of the United 
States to enhance the opportunity for 
women to meaningfully participate in, con-
tribute to, and benefit from economic oppor-
tunities as individuals, workers, consumers, 
innovators, entrepreneurs, and investors, so 
that they enjoy the same access, rights, and 
opportunities as men to participate in, con-
tribute to, control, and benefit from eco-
nomic activity.’’; 
Whereas, according to the World Health 
Organization, global maternal mortality de-
creased by approximately 44 percent between 
1990 and 2015, yet approximately 830 women 
and girls continue to die from preventable 
causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth 
each day, and 99 percent of all maternal 
deaths occur in developing countries; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Population Fund, of the 830 women and ado-
lescent girls who die every day from prevent-
able causes relating to pregnancy and child-
birth, 507 die each day in countries that are 
considered fragile because of conflict or dis-
aster, accounting for approximately 3⁄5 of all 
maternal deaths worldwide; 
Whereas the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 
women and girls comprise approximately 1⁄2 
of the 67,200,000 refugees and internally dis-
placed or stateless individuals in the world; 
Whereas women and girls in humanitarian 
emergencies, including those subject to 
forced displacement, face increased and exac-
erbated vulnerabilities to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including, rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, human 
trafficking, and sexual exploitation and as-
sault; 
(2) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(3) lack of access to comprehensive health 
services and information; and 
(4) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas malnutrition poses a variety of 
threats to women and girls specifically, as 
malnutrition can weaken their immune sys-
tems, making them more susceptible to in-
fections, and affects their capacity to sur-
vive childbirth, and children born of mal-
nourished women and girls are more likely 
to have cognitive impairments and higher 
risk of disease throughout their lives; 
Whereas it is imperative— 
(1) to alleviate violence and discrimination 
against women and girls; and 
(2) to afford women and girls every oppor-
tunity to be full and productive members of 
their communities; and 
Whereas March 8, 2020, is recognized as 
International Women’s Day, a global day— 
(1) to celebrate the economic, political, 
and social achievements of women in the 
past, present, and future; and 
(2) to recognize the obstacles that women 
face in the struggle for equal rights and op-
portunities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of International 
Women’s Day; 
(2) recognizes that the ability of women 
and girls to fully access and enjoy funda-
mental human rights has intrinsic value 
that affects their quality of life and ability 
to determine their own futures; 
(3) recognizes that the empowerment of 
women and girls is inextricably linked to the 
potential of a country to generate— 
(A) economic growth and self-reliance; 
(B) sustainable peace and democracy; and 
(C) inclusive security; 
(4) recognizes and honors individuals in the 
United States and around the world, includ-
ing women human rights defenders, girl ac-
tivists, and civil society leaders, who have 
worked throughout history to ensure that 
women and girls are guaranteed equality and 
fundamental human rights; 
(5) recognizes the unique cultural, histor-
ical, and religious differences throughout the 
world and urges the United States Govern-
ment to act with respect and understanding 
toward legitimate differences when pro-
moting any policies; 
(6) reaffirms the commitment— 
(A) to end discrimination and violence 
against women and girls; 
(B) to ensure the safety, health, and wel-
fare of women and girls; 
(C) to pursue policies that guarantee the 
fundamental human rights of women and 
girls worldwide; and 
(D) to promote meaningful and significant 
participation of women in every aspect of so-
ciety and community, including conflict pre-
vention, 
protection, 
peacemaking, 
and 
peacebuilding; 
(7) supports sustainable, measurable, and 
global development that seeks to achieve 
gender equality and the empowerment of 
women and girls; and 
(8) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe International Women’s 
Day with appropriate programs and activi-
ties.

WEEK’’ 
Ms. ROSEN (for herself and Mr. 
MORAN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 534 
Whereas the first week of March is inter-
nationally known as ‘‘Women of Aviation 
Worldwide Week’’; 
Whereas Women of Aviation Worldwide 
Week was created by the Institute for 
Women Of Aviation Worldwide; 
Whereas, over the last 5 years, the aviation 
industry has experienced an increase in pas-
senger traffic by an average of 6.5 percent 
per year; 
Whereas the aviation industry is antici-
pating a significant shortage of skilled pro-
fessionals in the coming years; 
Whereas the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 
the Department of Labor projected that, in 
the next 10 years, the overall employment of 
airline and commercial pilots is expected to 
grow more than 6 percent in the United 
States; 
Whereas less than 2 percent of the aircraft 
maintenance technicians in the world and 
less than 10 percent of all working aero-
nautical engineers are women; 
Whereas the Federal Aviation Administra-
tion reports that less than 8 percent of pilots 
and only 26 percent of air traffic controllers 
in the United States are women; 
Whereas women make up only 24 percent of 
the employees in the aerospace industry; 
Whereas aviation is a science, technology, 
engineering, and math (commonly known as 
‘‘STEM’’) focused career path; 
Whereas the future of an abundant avia-
tion workforce depends on a robust and di-
verse pool of candidates; and 
Whereas women such as Amelia Earhart, 
Cicely Williams, Nicole Malachowski, Bessie

SENATE RESOLUTION 535—DESIG-
NATING MARCH 5, 2020, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL ‘SLAM THE SCAM’ DAY’’ 
TO 
RAISE 
AWARENESS 
ABOUT 
THE 
INCREASING 
NUMBER 
OF 
GOVERNMENT IMPOSTER SCAMS, 
TO ENCOURAGE THE IMPLEMEN-
TATION OF POLICIES TO PRE-
VENT 
GOVERNMENT 
IMPOSTER 
SCAMS, 
AND 
TO 
ENCOURAGE 
THE IMPROVEMENT OF PROTEC-
TIONS FROM GOVERNMENT IM-
POSTER SCAMS FOR THE PEO-
PLE OF THE UNITED STATES 
Ms. 
COLLINS 
(for 
herself, 
Ms. 
SINEMA, Ms. MCSALLY, and Mr. CASEY) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 535 
Whereas millions of individuals in the 
United States are targeted by scams each 
year, including government imposter scams, 
such as the Social Security impersonation 
scam and the Internal Revenue Service im-
personation scam, sweepstakes scams, ro-
mance scams, computer tech support scams, 
grandparent scams, debt scams, home im-
provement scams, fraudulent investment 
schemes, and identity theft; 
Whereas, since 2013, the fraud hotline of 
the Special Committee on Aging of the Sen-
ate has received more than 9,500 complaints 
from individuals in all 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico reporting possible scams; 
Whereas government imposter scams in-
volve criminals contacting individuals in the 
United States and impersonating employees 
of government agencies, such as the Social 
Security Administration, to demand pay-
ment or personal information, which de-
frauds individuals of the United States and 
erodes trust in the government agencies that 
the criminals impersonate; 
Whereas, since 2014, fraud from govern-
ment imposter scams has been the top fraud 
type reported to the Federal Trade Commis-
sion; 
Whereas there were nearly 390,000 govern-
ment imposter scams reported to the Federal 
Trade Commission in 2019; 
Whereas the Federal Trade Commission 
has estimated that victims lost nearly 
$153,000,000 to government imposter scams in 
2019; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Trade 
Commission, in 2018, older adults reported 
larger median individual losses as a result of 
government imposter scams than younger 
adults; 
Whereas, in 2019, the fraud hotline of the 
Special Committee on Aging of the Senate 
received more than 5 times the number of 
Social Security impersonation scam com-
plaints than that hotline received in 2018; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Trade 
Commission— 
(1) individuals in the United States re-
ported losing nearly $38,000,000 to the Social 
Security impersonation scam in 2019; and 
(2) in 2018, the Social Security imperson-
ation scam contributed to an increase from 
2017 in median financial losses reported by 
older individuals of the United States; and 
Whereas increased awareness of, and edu-
cation about, government imposter scams 
help 
to 
thwart 
government 
imposter 
scammers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 5, 2020, as ‘‘National 
‘Slam the Scam’ Day’’; 
(2) recognizes National ‘‘Slam the Scam’’ 
Day as an opportunity to raise awareness 
about scams that involve individuals imper-
sonating government employees by mail, on 
the phone, or online (referred to in this re-
solving clause as ‘‘government imposter 
scams’’); 
(3) recognizes that law enforcement agen-
cies, consumer protection groups, area agen-
cies on aging, and financial institutions all 
play vital roles in— 
(A) preventing government imposter scams 
from targeting the people of the United 
States; and 
(B) educating the people of the United 
States about government imposter scams; 
(4) encourages— 
(A) the implementation of policies to pre-
vent government imposter scams; and 
(B) the improvement of measures to pro-
tect the people of the United States from 
government imposter scams; 
(5) encourages members of the public to— 
(A) hang up on calls from individuals false-
ly claiming to represent government agen-
cies; 
(B) share information about government 
imposter scams with family and friends; and 
(C) report government imposter scams to— 
(i) the Inspector General of the Social Se-
curity Administration; 
(ii) the Treasury Inspector General for Tax 
Administration; or 
(iii) the Federal Trade Commission; and 
(6) honors the commitment and dedication 
of the individuals and organizations who 
work tirelessly to fight against government 
imposter scams. 
Mrs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to recognize today, March 5, as Na-
tional ‘‘Slam the Scam’’ Day. I first 
want to thank my colleague from Ari-
zona, Senator SINEMA, for working 
with me on a Senate resolution desig-
nating today as National ‘‘Slam the 
Scam’’ Day. This resolution will help 
raise awareness of Government im-
poster scams with a single message: 
hang up and tell someone. 
In 
Government 
imposter 
scams, 
criminals claim to be from Govern-
ment agencies, such as the Social Se-
curity Administration, and call Ameri-
cans demanding payment or personal 
information. 
These scams look real because they 
often 
begin 
with 
an 
unsolicited 
robocall using a spoofed caller ID, 
showing the name of the Government 
agency they are pretending to be. In re-
ality, the Government would never call 
to threaten you or demand payment 
using gift cards, cash, wire transfers, 
or internet cryptocurrency. 
Government imposter scams have 
been the number one complaint re-
ported to the Aging Committee’s Fraud 
Hotline since its creation in 2013. Over 
the last two years, nearly 2,000 Maine 
consumers reported Government im-
poster scams to the Federal Trade 
Commission, with total losses of more 
than $700,000. 
Last year, the top reported scam to 
the Fraud Hotline, which the Aging 
Committee featured in our first hear-
ing of the year, was the Social Security 
Administration impersonation scam. 
Americans reported losing nearly $38 
million to this scam in 2019 alone, ac-
cording to the Federal Trade Commis-
sion. That undoubtedly is the tip of the 
iceberg. 
Scammers are ruthlessly targeting 
Americans, 
and 
particularly 
older 
Americans, across the country. In 2016, 
Philip Hatch, an 81-year Navy veteran 
from Maine, lost $8,000 of his hard- 
earned savings to a Government imper-
sonation scam. These scammers first 
posed as IRS agents and then imper-
sonated the Portland Police Depart-
ment. 
Just last year, a Maine senior re-
ported a call from someone claiming to 
work for the Social Security Adminis-
tration. The caller told him that his 
Social Security number matched a 
credit card used to rent a car found on 
the Texas border filled with drugs and 
blood. The caller provided an FBI ID 
number and correctly identified when 
my constituent had recently visited 
Texas on business. When prompted by 
the scammer, he confirmed his date of 
birth and Social Security number. 
These pernicious scams not only 
steal the savings of hardworking Amer-
icans and threaten to compromise their 
personal information; they also erode 
public trust and make it more difficult 
for Federal, State, and local govern-
ment agencies to fulfill their missions. 
The Aging Committee, which I chair, 
has held 25 hearings on scams over the 
past seven years, and we have exam-
ined Government imposter scams from 
a number of angles. Public awareness 
can help to stop these scams from the 
start. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
marking today as National ‘‘Slam the 
Scam’’ Day by supporting our resolu-
tion. Let’s work together to hang up on 
these Government imposters and put 
them out of business once and for all. 
Let’s slam these scams.

SA 1523. Mr. MCCONNELL (for Mr. 
BLUNT) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 2321, to require the Secretary of 
the Treasury to mint a coin in com-
memoration of the 100th anniversary of 
the establishment of Negro Leagues 
baseball; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Negro 
Leagues Baseball Centennial Commemora-
tive Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The year 2020 marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the establishment of the Negro Na-
tional League, a professional baseball league 
formed in response to African-American 
players 
being 
banned 
from 
the 
major 
leagues. 
(2) On February 13, 1920, Andrew ‘‘Rube’’ 
Foster convened a meeting of 8 independent 
African-American baseball team owners at 
the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri, to 
form a ‘‘league of their own,’’ establishing 
the Negro National League, the first success-
ful, organized professional African-American 
baseball league in the United States. 
(3) Soon, additional leagues formed in east-
ern and southern States. 
(4) The Negro Leagues would operate for 40 
years until 1960. 
(5) The story of the Negro Leagues is a 
story of strong-willed athletes who forged a 
glorious history in the midst of an inglorious 
era of segregation in the United States. 
(6) The passion of the Negro Leagues play-
ers for the ‘‘National Pastime’’ would not 
only change the game, but also the United 
States. 
(7) The creation of the Negro Leagues pro-
vided a playing field for more than 2,600 Afri-
can-American and Hispanic baseball players 
to showcase their world-class baseball abili-
ties. 
(8) The Negro Leagues introduced an excit-
ing brand of baseball that was in stark con-
trast to Major League Baseball. 
(9) A fast, aggressive style of play at-
tracted black and white fans who sat to-
gether to watch those games at a time when 
it was virtually unheard of to interact so-
cially in such a way. 
(10) Negro Leagues baseball would become 
a catalyst for economic development across 
the United States in major urban centers 
such as Kansas City, St. Louis, New York, 
Memphis, Baltimore, Washington, DC, Chi-
cago, and Atlanta. 
(11) The Negro Leagues pioneered ‘‘Night 
Baseball’’ in 1930, 5 years before Major 
League Baseball, and would introduce game- 
changing innovations such as shin guards 
and the batting helmet. 
(12) The Negro Leagues helped make the 
National Pastime a global game as players 
from the Negro Leagues— 
(A) were the first people from the United 
States to play in many Spanish-speaking 
countries; and 
(B) introduced professional baseball to the 
Japanese in 1927. 
(13) Jackie Robinson, a military veteran 
and former member of the Negro Leagues’ 
Kansas City Monarchs, would break Major 
League Baseball’s color barrier on April 15, 
1947, with the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the 
way for other African-American and His-
panic baseball players. 
(14) The Negro Leagues were born out of 
segregation yet would become a driving force 
for social change in the United States. 
(15) The Negro Leagues produced future 
Major 
League 
Baseball 
stars, 
including 
Leroy ‘‘Satchel’’ Paige, Larry Doby, Willie 
Mays, Henry Aaron, Ernie Banks, and Roy 
Campanella. 
(16) The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum 
was established in Kansas City, Missouri, in 
1990— 
(A) to save from extinction a precious 
piece of Americana and baseball history; and 
(B) to use the many life lessons of the pow-
erful story of triumph over adversity of 
Negro Leagues players to promote tolerance, 
diversity, and inclusion. 
(17) In 2006, Congress granted National Des-
ignation to the Negro Leagues Baseball Mu-
seum, recognizing it as ‘‘America’s Home’’ 
for Negro Leagues baseball history. 
SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.

SA 1524. Mr. McCONNELL (for Ms. 
ERNST) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 1757, to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal, collectively, to the United 
States 
Army 
Rangers 
Veterans 
of 
World War II in recognition of their ex-
traordinary service during World War 
II; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘United 
States Army Rangers Veterans of World War 
II Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act— 
(1) the term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Sec-
retary of the Treasury; and 
(2) the term ‘‘United States Army Rangers 
Veteran of World War II’’ means any indi-
vidual who— 
(A) served in the Armed Forces— 
(i) honorably; 
(ii) in an active duty status; and 
(iii) at any time during the period begin-
ning on June 19, 1942, and ending on Sep-
tember 2, 1945; and 
(B) was assigned to a Ranger Battalion of 
the Army at any time during the period de-
scribed in subparagraph (A)(iii). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In World War II, the Army formed 6 
Ranger Battalions and 1 provisional bat-
talion. All members of the Ranger Battalions 
were volunteers. The initial concept of Rang-
er units drew from the British method of 
using highly trained ‘‘commando’’ units and 
the military tradition of the United States 
of utilizing light infantry for scouting and 
raiding operations. 
(2) The Ranger Battalions of World War II 
consisted of— 
(A) the 1st Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on June 19, 1942, in 
Northern Ireland; 
(B) the 2d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on April 1, 1943, at Camp 
Forrest, Tennessee; 
(C) the 3d Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) activated as provisional on May 21, 1943, 
in North Africa; and 
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and con-
currently consolidated with the provisional 
unit described in clause (i); 
(D) the 4th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) activated as provisional on May 29, 1943, 
in North Africa; and 
(ii) constituted on July 21, 1943, and con-
currently consolidated with the provisional 
unit described in clause (i); 
(E) the 5th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was activated on September 1, 1943, at 
Camp Forrest, Tennessee; 
(F) the 6th Ranger Infantry Battalion, 
which was— 
(i) originally activated on January 20, 1941, 
at Fort Lewis, Washington, as the 98th Field 
Artillery Battalion; and 
(ii) converted and redesignated on Sep-
tember 26, 1944, as the 6th Ranger Infantry 
Battalion; and 
(G) the 29th Ranger Infantry Battalion, a 
provisional Army National Guard unit that 
was— 
(i) activated on December 20, 1942, at 
Tidworth Barracks, England; and 
(ii) disbanded on October 18, 1943. 
(3) The first combat operations of Army 
Rangers occurred on August 19, 1942, when 50 
Rangers took part in the British-Canadian 
raid on the French coastal town of Dieppe. 
(4) The 1st Ranger Battalion, under the 
leadership of Major William O. Darby, was 
used in full strength during the landings at 
Arsew, Algeria, during the North African 
campaign. Due to the success of the Rangers 
in several difficult battles, particularly at El 
Guettar in March and April of 1943, 2 addi-
tional Ranger Battalions were organized in 
North Africa. 
(5) During the North African campaign, the 
1st Ranger Battalion was awarded battle 
honors for its actions in Tunisia. On March 
20, 1943, the Battalion penetrated enemy 
lines and captured the position Djebel el Ank 
in a nighttime attack, taking more than 200 
prisoners. Three days later, the battalion 
was attacked by the 10th Panzer division of 
the German Afrika Korps and, despite heavy 
losses, defended its position and inflicted 
considerable losses on the enemy. This en-
gagement constituted what General Omar 
Bradley labeled ‘‘the first solid, indisputable 
defeat we inflicted on the German army in 
the war’’. These actions demonstrated the 
ability of the Rangers to fight in difficult 
terrain and the courage to endure despite 
being outnumbered and exposed to heavy 
enemy fire. 
(6) The 29th provisional Ranger Battalion 
was formed from volunteers drawn from the 
29th Infantry Division stationed in England 
in the fall of 1942. The Battalion was acti-
vated on December 20, 1942, and accompanied 
British commandos on 3 small-scale raids in 
Norway. Nineteen members of the 29th Rang-
er Battalion conducted a raid on a German 
radar site in France on the night of Sep-
tember 3, 1943. After that raid, the 29th 
Ranger Battalion was disbanded because new 
Ranger units, the 2d and 5th Battalions, were 
being formed. 
(7) During the summer and fall of 1943, the 
1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Battalions were heav-
ily involved in the campaign in Sicily and 
the landings in Italy. The 1st and 4th Ranger 
Battalions conducted a night amphibious 
landing in Sicily and secured the landing 
beaches for the main force. The 3d Battalion 
landed separately at Licata, Sicily, and was 
able to silence gun positions on an 82-foot 
cliff overlooking the invasion beaches. 
(8) During the invasion of Italy, the 1st, 3d, 
and 4th Ranger Battalions landed at Maiori 
with the mission of seizing the high ground 
and protecting the flank of the remainder of 
the main landing by the United States. De-
spite suffering from low ammunition and in-
adequate provisions and water, the Rangers 
fended off numerous enemy counterattacks 
against the mountain passes and via radio 
directed naval gunfire on the enemy forces 
approaching the beaches below. 
(9) After the invasion of Italy, Rangers 
continued to be used, often in night attacks, 
to seize key terrain ahead of the advancing 
Allied forces. At the Anzio beachhead, the 
majority of the 1st, 3d, and 4th Ranger Bat-
talions sustained heavy casualties after 
being cut off behind German lines. The Rang-
ers had planned to infiltrate German posi-
tions under the cover of darkness and make 
a dawn attack on a critical road junction but 
were pinned down by enemy tanks and an 
elite German paratrooper unit. After 12 
hours of desperate fighting and a failed relief 
attempt, the majority of the Ranger force 
was killed, wounded, or captured. Only 6 
Rangers from the 1st and 3d Battalions, out 
of more than 767 men, returned to friendly 
lines. The 4th Battalion, which had been in 
reserve, also suffered 60 killed and 120 
wounded out of 550 men. These 3 battalions 
were inactivated and the survivors were 
transferred to other units. 
(10) In the United States, and later in Scot-
land, the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were 
formed to undertake operations in Western 
Europe. Those Battalions were engaged on D- 
Day, assaulting German positions at the 
Pointe du Hoc coastal battery, and remained 
in combat through September of 1944. Spe-
cifically, Rangers in the 2d Battalion, under 
the command of Lieutenant Colonel James 
E. Rudder—

March 5, 2020 
(A) overcame mines, machine gun fire, and 
enemy artillery while scaling the 100-foot 
high cliffs at Pointe du Hoc; 
(B) held against intense German efforts to 
retake the position; and 
(C) after reaching the top of the cliffs, 
moved inland roughly 1 mile and sustained 
heavy casualties while searching for, and ul-
timately destroying, a German heavy artil-
lery battery. 
(11) During June, July, and August of 1944, 
the 2d and 5th Ranger Battalions were en-
gaged in the campaign in Brest, which in-
cluded close-range fighting in hedgerows and 
numerous villages. Later, in operations in 
Western Germany, the Battalions were fre-
quently used to attack in darkness and gain 
vital positions to pave the way for the main 
Army attacks. 
(12) During the final drive into Germany in 
late February and early March 1945, the 5th 
Ranger Battalion was cited for battle honors 
for outstanding performance. Under the 
cover of darkness the unit drove into Ger-
man lines and secured the objective area 
blocking the main German supply route. The 
Germans attacked the position of the Rang-
ers from both sides, resulting in heavy Rang-
er casualties during 5 days of fighting. As a 
result of the actions of the Rangers, the 
main Army attack was able to overcome 
German defenses more easily, occupy the 
vital city of Trier, and reach the Rhine 
River. 
(13) The 6th Ranger Battalion operated in 
the Pacific. In the most notable exploit of 
the 6th Ranger Battalion, in January and 
February of 1945, the Battalion formed the 
nucleus of a rescue force that liberated more 
than 500 Allied prisoners, including prisoners 
from the United States, from the Caba-
natuan prisoner of war camp in the Phil-
ippines. With the help of local Filipino gue-
rillas, the Rangers, led by Lieutenant Colo-
nel Henry A. Mucci, demonstrated extraor-
dinary heroism by infiltrating Japanese-held 
territory to reach the prisoners of war and 
prevent them from being killed by the Japa-
nese. After a 25-mile march at night through 
the jungle, the unit killed all Japanese sen-
tries with no loss of life of the prisoners of 
war. The unit successfully returned to Amer-
ican lines having lost only 2 soldiers killed 
and having another 2 wounded.

tion and streamer embroidered with ‘‘17 OC-

(20) The United States will be forever in-
debted to the United States Army Rangers

the allies of the United States.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1613 
March 5, 2020 
The amendment (No. 1523), in the na-
ture of a substitute, was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Negro 
Leagues Baseball Centennial Commemora-
tive Coin Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds the following: 
(1) The year 2020 marks the 100th anniver-
sary of the establishment of the Negro Na-
tional League, a professional baseball league 
formed in response to African-American 
players 
being 
banned 
from 
the 
major 
leagues. 
(2) On February 13, 1920, Andrew ‘‘Rube’’ 
Foster convened a meeting of 8 independent 
African-American baseball team owners at 
the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, Missouri, to 
form a ‘‘league of their own,’’ establishing 
the Negro National League, the first success-
ful, organized professional African-American 
baseball league in the United States. 
(3) Soon, additional leagues formed in east-
ern and southern States. 
(4) The Negro Leagues would operate for 40 
years until 1960. 
(5) The story of the Negro Leagues is a 
story of strong-willed athletes who forged a 
glorious history in the midst of an inglorious 
era of segregation in the United States. 
(6) The passion of the Negro Leagues play-
ers for the ‘‘National Pastime’’ would not 
only change the game, but also the United 
States. 
(7) The creation of the Negro Leagues pro-
vided a playing field for more than 2,600 Afri-
can-American and Hispanic baseball players 
to showcase their world-class baseball abili-
ties. 
(8) The Negro Leagues introduced an excit-
ing brand of baseball that was in stark con-
trast to Major League Baseball. 
(9) A fast, aggressive style of play at-
tracted black and white fans who sat to-
gether to watch those games at a time when 
it was virtually unheard of to interact so-
cially in such a way. 
(10) Negro Leagues baseball would become 
a catalyst for economic development across 
the United States in major urban centers 
such as Kansas City, St. Louis, New York, 
Memphis, Baltimore, Washington, DC, Chi-
cago, and Atlanta. 
(11) The Negro Leagues pioneered ‘‘Night 
Baseball’’ in 1930, 5 years before Major 
League Baseball, and would introduce game- 
changing innovations such as shin guards 
and the batting helmet. 
(12) The Negro Leagues helped make the 
National Pastime a global game as players 
from the Negro Leagues— 
(A) were the first people from the United 
States to play in many Spanish-speaking 
countries; and 
(B) introduced professional baseball to the 
Japanese in 1927. 
(13) Jackie Robinson, a military veteran 
and former member of the Negro Leagues’ 
Kansas City Monarchs, would break Major 
League Baseball’s color barrier on April 15, 
1947, with the Brooklyn Dodgers, paving the 
way for other African-American and His-
panic baseball players. 
(14) The Negro Leagues were born out of 
segregation yet would become a driving force 
for social change in the United States. 
(15) The Negro Leagues produced future 
Major 
League 
Baseball 
stars, 
including 
Leroy ‘‘Satchel’’ Paige, Larry Doby, Willie 
Mays, Henry Aaron, Ernie Banks, and Roy 
Campanella. 
(16) The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum 
was established in Kansas City, Missouri, in 
1990— 
(A) to save from extinction a precious 
piece of Americana and baseball history; and 
(B) to use the many life lessons of the pow-
erful story of triumph over adversity of 
Negro Leagues players to promote tolerance, 
diversity, and inclusion. 
(17) In 2006, Congress granted National Des-
ignation to the Negro Leagues Baseball Mu-
seum, recognizing it as ‘‘America’s Home’’ 
for Negro Leagues baseball history.

MENSTRUAL EQUITY IN THE 
PEACE CORPS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the introduction of the Menstrual 
Equity in the Peace Corps Act. 
On March 1st, we recognized the 59th Anni-
versary of the Peace Corps. Established by 
Executive Order 10924, issued by President 
John F. Kennedy, and authorized by Con-
gress, Peace Corps has been an enduring 
symbol of peace and friendship between the 
U.S. and our global community. Peace Corps 
Volunteers (PCVs) sacrifice over two years of 
their time, working side by side with local lead-
ers to combat some of the most pressing chal-
lenges of our generation. This is a trans-
formational time for many of our volunteers— 
and I am particularly proud of the many con-
stituents from my congressional district of New 
York’s Sixth who have served abroad in 
Peace Corps. 
At the same time, however, I have heard 
from many PCVs around the world who strug-
gle to access and afford menstrual hygiene 
products. These current PCVs and Returned 
Peace Corps Volunteers (RPCV) note how 
menstrual products are not readily available, 
or these items are far more expensive than 
they would be in the U.S. So many of these 
volunteers are also placed in very remote lo-
cations. In fact, for one RPCV who served in 
an indigenous island, she had to travel by a 
combination of cargo ship rides (10+ hours), 
plane ride(s), small boat ride, several hour 
hikes, and hitchhiking to get to and from the 
capital, where the Peace Corps Country Office 
is located. Ultimately, for some PCVs, not only 
is there a financial hurdle, but a volunteer may 
have to travel extremely far distances to ac-
cess menstrual hygiene products. 
There is also vast inconsistency in the provi-
sion of these products for the volunteers. 
Some Peace Corps Medical Officers provide 
these products for free to their respective 
PCVs, while others are left to purchase the 
products out of pocket. Other country offices 
provide an additional stipend to volunteers to 
purchase these products, while other volun-
teers wait to receive these items in their care 
packages from loved ones back home. I also 
heard a U.S. Peace Corps staff equate these 
products to mere razors and shaving cream— 
ultimately disregarding the medical necessity 
for these products. 
To address this inequity, I am introducing a 
bill—the Menstrual Equity in the Peace Corps 
Act—to require the enactment of a com-
prehensive policy that makes available free 
menstrual hygiene products to PCVs, or in-
crease stipends to allow for these expenses. 
Menstrual hygiene products are not luxury or 
toiletry items. These are medical necessities; 
a health right and human right. And this is a 
simple matter of equality. 
Madam Speaker, today, PCVs serve in over 
60 countries around the world. Nearly 65 per-
cent of PCVs are women, and more than 90 
percent of these volunteers are under the age 
of 50. PCVs are already making both financial 
and personal sacrifices in order to represent 
the United States abroad, and they are a crit-
ical part of U.S. development power. Peace 
Corps notes that ‘nothing is more important 
than the health, safety, and security of every 
single volunteer.’ 
Indeed, for the health, safety, and security 
of these volunteers, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Menstrual Equity in the Peace 
Corps Act. I thank my colleagues who have al-
ready joined me in introducing this critical leg-
islation, and I urge the House of Representa-
tives to join me in passing this critical legisla-
tion.

HONORING 
KELSEY 
KRUSE 
AND 
DANE KRUSE AS IOWANS OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing two outstanding young Iowans, 
Dane and Kelsey Kruse from Silver City, Iowa. 
These two, brother and sister, are young farm-
ers in Mills County continuing the family tradi-
tion on the farm. They were recently featured 
in a national advertising campaign that fo-
cused on the challenges young farmers face. 
Dane and Kelsey, or the ‘‘Kruse Kids,’’ are 
sixth-generation hog farmers that sell to 
Niman Ranch. Both in their early 20s, Dane 
and Kelsey are young faces in a profession 
where the average age is nearly 58. As 
Kelsey said, ‘‘It’s becoming very difficult for 
younger people to get themselves started’’ in 
farming. 
I know many of my colleagues agree on 
how important it is to support young farmers 
like Kelsey and Dane. Nothing is more critical 
to the future of Iowa’s rural economy than 
young people returning home to their commu-
nity and carrying on the family tradition. Too 
often we see young Iowans moving away from 
their communities to seek opportunity else-
where. 
Not only are the Kruse Kids helping their 
community by returning home after college, 
they are serving as incredible ambassadors 
for rural Iowa as the focus of national atten-
tion. Earlier this year, Dane and Kelsey joined 
other young farmers and participated in the 
Rose Parade on New Year’s Day to kick off 
Chipotle’s ‘‘Cultivate the Future of Farming’’ 
initiative. 
The Kruse family hogs are raised naturally 
with plenty of room, fed a vegetarian diet, and 
are antibiotic free. As consumers want to 
know more about where their food comes 
from, the Kruse Kids, along with their father 
Jeff, are proud to show off their farm and how 
they raise their Iowa hogs. 
I’m proud to honor Dane and Kelsey as our 
Iowans of the Week. As Dane shared to mil-
lions in the commercial, farming isn’t easy. But 
why does he do it? ‘‘You can say it is in my 
blood, you can say I’m crazy, I don’t know, I 
just like farming.’’ 
I hope you all will join me in recognizing 
Dane and Kelsey Kruse, along with all other 
young farmers across the country, and con-
tinue to work to ensure more kids have the re-
sources they need to continue the family tradi-
tion.

DENNIS CULNAN, SR. 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the Mount Lau-
rel, New Jersey resident Dennis Culnan, Sr. 
for his 75th Birthday. 
On Saturday February 22, 2020, family and 
friends will gather to celebrate and honor Mr. 
Dennis Culnan, Sr. on his 75th Birthday. Mr. 
Dennis Culnan, Sr. was born on February 14, 
1945 and grew up in Northeast Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania. 
Throughout his childhood he often encoun-
tered challenging and adverse circumstances 
as his family struggled to make ends meet. 
However, life changed after he first saw the 
love of his life, Joan Plocharska. At the age of 
14, Mr. Dennis Culnan, Sr. met Joan while at-
tending Father Judge High School, Philadel-
phia, Pennsylvania. Joan, as Dennis de-
scribes, was sweet, shy and as delicate as a 
snowflake. Dennis and Joan dated on and off 
for several years and eventually married in 
1966. 
Following his graduation in 1964 Mr. Dennis 
Culnan, Sr. honorably enlisted in the United 
States Marine Corps. He quickly earned the 
rank of Lance corporal and proudly served his 
country before being medically discharged. 
Thereafter he returned home and estab-
lished himself as an award-winning investiga-
tive reporter, political writer and columnist for 
the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, 
where he worked for nearly four decades. Fur-
thermore, with his extensive experience in 
public relations and governmental affairs con-
sulting, in 1993, Dennis founded the public af-
fairs firm Phoenix Strategies, specializing in 
government relations, communications, lob-
bying and grassroots education. 
During his time with the firm, Mr. Dennis 
Culnan, Sr. served in many capacities, includ-
ing as the director of marketing and commu-
nications strategy for Siemen’s Transportation 
while AMTRAK was introducing high-speed 
rail from Washington, D.C. to Boston, Massa-
chusetts. Recently he led New Jersey’s con-
sulting and marketing messaging for Spectra 
Energy’s successful 1.2-billion-dollar energy

infrastructure project and provided the mar-
keting, media relations and communication 
needs for the South Jersey Port Corporation. 
Mr. Culnan’s family are of the utmost impor-
tance to him. He is often known to refer to his 
wife Joan, his sister Tina and his mother 
Dorothy, as his ‘‘Holy Trinity’’. Although his be-
loved wife Joan, passed on in 2011, after 45 
years of marriage her memory will always live 
on through their love and their family. To-
gether, Dennis and Joan have two sons, Den-
nis Culnan, Jr. and Derek Culnan, two daugh-
ters-in-law Silvia and Genevieve, and two 
grandchildren Dillon and Kaitlin. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the life and career of Mr. Dennis 
Culnan, Sr. of Mount Laurel, New Jersey, on 
his 75th Birthday.

CORONAVIRUS 
PREPAREDNESS 
AND RESPONSE SUPPLEMENTAL 
APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in strong support of the H.R. 6074, 
the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response 
Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020, 
which will provide $8.3 billion in funding to 
combat the novel coronavirus. 
The legislation includes $950 million for 
state and local health agencies to conduct 
vital public health activities, including surveil-
lance, laboratory testing, infection control, con-
tact tracing, and mitigation. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the 9 fam-
ilies who lost a loved one to the coronavirus, 
and the many others who have contracted the 
disease. 
We owe a special debt to First Responders 
who will be the lifeline for many who will need 
medical care to overcome this coronavirus de-
signed as COVID–19. 
Earlier this year, when I saw news reports 
in early January on the novel Coronavirus’s 
rapid spread and the numbers of infected ex-
panding so quickly, I knew this was not some-
thing to be taken lightly and that time was not 
on our side to mount an effective defense. 
On February 10, 2020, I held the first press 
conference 
on 
the 
issue 
of 
the 
novel 
coronavirus at Houston Intercontinental Air-
port. 
I was joined by public health officials, local 
unions, and advocates to raise awareness re-
garding the virus and the implications it might 
have for travel to the United States from China 
and to combat early signs of discrimination 
targeting Asian businesses in the United 
States. 
On February 24, 2020, I held a second 
press conference on the International Health 
Regulations Emergency Committee of the 
World Health Organization declaration of a 
‘‘public health emergency from the outbreak of 
the Coronavirus.’’ 
At that time, I formally requested the Presi-
dent of the United States by letter to imme-
diately suspend any health-related cuts that 
impact efforts to contain and treat the 
coronavirus, including the $3.3 billion in cuts 
to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and 
the discretionary budget cuts for the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of 
nearly 19 percent at $678 million, severely 
threatening the CDC’s ability to respond to this 
and other epidemics in the future. 
Additionally, I requested the President to 
suspend cuts in both the Medicare and Med-
icaid programs. 
On February 26, 2020, I sent a letter to the 
Chair and Ranking Member of the Committee 
on Homeland Security seeking a meeting with 
Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad 
Wolf to gain insight into the Preparedness of 
the Agency to address a possible pandemic. 
On February 28, 2020, I spoke on the Floor 
of the House and Announced plans to form a 
Congressional Coronavirus Task Force. 
I thank Congressmen BRIAN FITZPATRICK, 
Dr. RAUL RUIZ, and Congresswoman LAUREN 
UNDERWOOD for joining me as co-chairs of the 
Congressional Coronavirus Task Force. 
Today, March 4, 2020, the House of Rep-
resentatives is giving a full-throated response 
to coronavirus by introducing an $8.3 billion of 
new funding to help federal, state, and local 
public health departments meet the challenge 
of preparing communities for COVID–19. 
Among its provisions, the emergency sup-
plemental introduced by Chairwoman LOWEY 
includes: 
More than $3 billion for research and devel-
opment 
of 
vaccines, 
therapeutics, 
and 
diagnostics; 
$2.2 billion in public health funding for pre-
vention, preparedness, and response, $950 
million of which is to support state & local 
health agencies; 
Nearly $1 billion for procurement of pharma-
ceuticals and medical supplies, to support 
healthcare 
preparedness 
and 
Community 
Health Centers, and to improve medical surge 
capacity; 
$435 million to support health systems over-
seas to prevent, prepare, and respond to the 
coronavirus; 
$300 million to respond to humanitarian 
needs; 
$61 million to facilitate the development and 
review of medical countermeasures, devices, 
therapies, and vaccines, and to help mitigate 
potential supply chain interruptions; and 
Allows for an estimated $7 billion in low-in-
terest loans to affected small businesses. 
The emergency supplemental also contains 
other strong provisions to ensure a full re-
sponse and keep Americans safe. The bill: 
Requires that funds are only used to fight 
the coronavirus and other infectious diseases; 
Allows seniors to access telemedicine serv-
ices for coronavirus treatment; 
Helps ensure that vaccines and treatments 
for coronavirus are affordable; and 
Ensures that state and local governments 
are reimbursed for costs incurred while assist-
ing the federal response. 
Additionally, the bill includes a requirement 
to reimburse $136 million to important health 
accounts, including mental health and sub-
stance abuse treatment and prevention and 
heating and cooling assistance for low-income 
families, that was transferred by the Trump 
administration to support its response. 
On Tuesday, March 3, the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 
60 cases of COVID–19 from 12 states. Twen-
ty-two of these cases are travel-related; 11 are 
believed to be person-to-person spread; and 
for the remaining 27 the source of exposure is 
still under investigation. Noteworthy develop-
ments in recent days include: 
Florida announced its first and second pre-
sumptive positive cases of COVID–19, one in 
a person with recent travel history (to Italy), 
the other with no currently known travel or 
contact history. 
Georgia announced its first and second con-
firmed cases of COVID–19, one is a person 
with recent travel history (to Italy), the other in 
a close contact of the first patient. 
New Hampshire also reported its first pre-
sumptive positive case of COVID–19 in a per-
son with recent travel history (to Italy). 
New York state announced its first case of 
COVID–19 in a person with recent travel his-
tory (to Iran). 
Rhode Island announced its first presump-
tive positive case of COVID–19 in a person 
with recent travel history (to Italy). 
Washington state announced more cases of 
COVID–19 associated with an outbreak in a 
long-term care facility. Washington has an-
nounced it now has 14 cases of COVID–19, 
including 6 COVID–19 deaths. 
The 12 states that have reported cases in-
clude: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illi-
nois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New 
York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and 
Wisconsin. 
Today, the World Health Organization re-
ports a 3.4-percent mortality rate for COVID– 
19. 
The challenge with this new coronavirus is 
that it is highly contagious, and of those in-
fected, 15–20-percent contract pneumonia. 
And 5 percent of these cases may develop 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), 
which is a rapidly progressive disease occur-
ring in critically ill patients. 
The main complication in ARDS is that fluid 
leaks into the lungs making breathing difficult 
or impossible. 
This virus is a potentially serious public 
health threat, but this does not mean that we 
should have a public health panic. 
There are knowledgeable and trained virol-
ogists, public health experts, and physicians 
who are who need the funding provided by 
this bill. 
I also organized a bi-partisan task force on 
the COVID–19 to help Congressional Mem-
bers during this crisis to better serve their con-
stituents. 
I ask that my colleagues join me in voting in 
support of H.R. 6074.

OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Clayton Community Library 
as it marks its 25th anniversary. 
The effort to establish a library in the City of 
Clayton began in March of 1989 with the Clay-
ton Branch of the American Association of 
University Women (AAUW). Having decided 
that their community needed a library, the 
AAUW partnered with other community organi-
zations to create the Clayton Community Li-
brary 
Foundation. 
The 
foundation

and the Contra Costa County Library system 
to receive $2.8 million in grant funding. In 
order to protect Miwok artifacts, the library 
was built on a floating foundation. On March 
4, 1995, the Clayton Community Library cele-
brated its grand opening. 
Close to the center of downtown, the library 
serves as a meeting place for organizations 
and individuals of all ages. The library holds 
numerous events and activities throughout the 
year including literacy tutoring, craft programs, 
all abilities play groups, and family story time. 
Having represented Clayton since 1994 and 
as an active library supporter, I am proud of 
the partnership between the county, cities, 
workforce, and volunteers. 
Please join me in honoring Clayton Commu-
nity Library’s 25th anniversary.

named the Man of the Year by the Monsignor 
William Farrell Division of the Ancient Order of 
Hibernians. Matt will be honored at their an-
nual gathering on Saturday, March 7, 2020. 
Matt is the son of Francis P. Burnett and 
Zita Lavelle Burnett. He is a member of Saint 
Rose Parish where he volunteers his time with 
the Altar and Rose Society. For the past sev-
eral years, Matt has bravely battled Hunting-
ton’s chorea, a rare, debilitating condition that 
affects the nerve cells in the brain causing a 
deterioration of motor skills, cognitive abilities, 
and speech. His grandfather and mother also 
suffered from this inherited disease. Despite 
his diagnosis, he has worked tirelessly to re-
main positive and active in his local commu-
nity. 
Enthusiastic about volunteer firefighting, 
Matt was often found at the fire headquarters 
on Main Street in Carbondale. In addition to 
responding to calls, he spent long hours at the 
scene of a fire cleaning and packing gear to 
be prepared for the next call. He was always 
willing to lend a hand to any volunteer com-
pany that needed additional assistance. 
In 2006, prior to the onset of his illness, 
Matt and two fellow firefighters were honored 
for bravely entering a burning building to quell 
a fire which quickly turned into a heroic rescue 
mission. Their vision clouded with smoke, the 
three men advanced across the room, but the 
floor felt hot and spongy, threatening to give 
away at any moment. In their efforts to retreat, 
one of the firefighters fill to the basement as 
the floor between him and the exit collapsed. 
Alerted by their endangered partner tugging 
on the fire hose, Matt and his other partner 
went back into the building to pull him to safe-
ty. 
Matt does not let his illness stop him from 
pursuing his passions, including volunteer fire-
fighting. When a fire broke out earlier this 
year, Matt, undeterred by his physical limita-
tions, responded in full gear, doing everything 
he could to assist his fellow volunteers. 
It is an honor to join with the Monsignor Wil-
liam Farrell Division of the Ancient Order of 
Hibernians to recognize Matt Burnett as Man 
of the Year. Throughout his life, he has em-
bodied the virtues of friendship, unity, and 
Christian charity and has been selflessly dedi-
cated to others through the volunteer fire serv-
ice. I wish him all the best on this St. Patrick’s 
Day.

RECOGNIZING AYDEN POLICE 
CHIEF BARRY STANLEY 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to longtime law 
enforcement officer Barry Stanley, who retired 
this past Friday as Chief of Police in Ayden, 
North Carolina. Chief Stanley attended Pitt 
Community College for his law enforcement 
training, graduating in 1993. He has served 
several Eastern North Carolina communities 
during his career including Grifton, Bethel and 
Ayden. His service actually began in his youth 
with the explorer’s post at the Lenoir County 
Sherriff’s Department. 
Chief Stanley has long been passionate 
about helping those who are victims of crime, 
especially the elderly. He feels helping those 
who cannot speak for themselves is the most 
important part of his job. Chief Stanley is a 
great leader who leads with fairness and in-
tegrity, earning the trust of his team. He has 
the respect of the men and women under his 
command, but they also consider him a friend. 
He will definitely be remembered as a chief 
who made a difference. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the legacy of this brave and patriotic man who 
has served Eastern North Carolina for 27 
years. May we always keep our dedicated po-
lice officers and service members treasured in 
our hearts and constantly in our prayers for 
their service to God and country.

SPEECH OF 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I strongly sup-
port H.R. 6074, Coronavirus Preparedness 
and Response Supplemental Appropriations 
Act, and commend my fellow members of the 
Appropriations Committee, particularly the 
Gentlewoman from New York (Chairwoman 
LOWEY) and the Gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ranking Member GRANGER) for their leader-
ship. 
The robust, $8.3 billion package includes 
vital funding for research, local health depart-
ments, supplies, preparedness, affordable vac-
cines, and support for small businesses. 
I was particularly proud to support including 
$500 million to cover telehealth services for 
Medicare patients. 
This provision will reduce the number of 
non-urgent cases who have to go to emer-
gency rooms and doctors’ offices, a win for 
seniors, health care workers, and the general 
public. 
The resounding, bipartisan vote for the 
emergency funding shows that the People’s 
House is taking this outbreak seriously. 
We are committed to fully exercising Con-
gress’ Constitutional Power of the Purse in 
support of the fight against this disease.

Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Alan Walts for his distin-
guished, 44-year long career in the field of 
broadcasting on the occasion of his retire-
ment. 
Alan Walts began his broadcasting career in 
Watertown in 1976 and has hosted Water-
town’s Morning News on AM radio station, 790 
WTNY, for the past ten years. Glen Curry, 
General Manager at Stevens Media Group, 
said ‘‘Alan would arrive at the station at 4 a.m. 
every morning, rain or shine, through his en-
tire decade-long tenure as the host.’’ He has 
also been a consistent volunteer for many or-
ganizations including the Salvation Army. As 
host of the morning news show, Alan made 
himself a pillar of the Watertown community 
and his departure marks the end of an era. 
Alan Walts demonstrates the hard working, 
community minded nature that the North 
Country is known for. On behalf of New York’s 
21st District, I would like to thank Alan for his 
contribution to the community and wish him 
well on this next chapter in his life.

RECOGNIZING A SPACECOAST 
SYMBOL OF KINDNESS 
HON. BILL POSEY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commend kindergarten students in my Con-
gressional district who have made it a priority 
and to remind us that kindness ‘‘is always 
possible.’’ 
Nearly a year ago, transition kindergarten 
teacher Ms. Barbara Wilcox inspired her class 
at Tropical Elementary on Merritt Island in 
Brevard County, Florida, to join an initiative 
they called ‘‘Together Kind.’’ She shared, ‘‘I do 
a lot of service learning with them, talking 
about how to be kind to people.’’ 
Children often ‘‘get it’’ when adults are slow 
to respond. That certainly played out strongly 
in Ms. Wilcox’s class. The children wanted to 
make a difference. They recognized the mean-
ing behind common symbols like the peace 
sign, the happy face and the heart, for love. 
And, in their wisdom, they perceived the value 
of having a symbol to remind the world of the 
importance of just being kind to one another. 
The class designed four candidates for a 
Symbol of Kindness and took their vision to 
the world. They shared their symbols on 
Facebook, through email, and a website they 
created called togetherkind.com. About 1,000 
people from 25 states (and England and Ire-
land) voted and decided the winner. 
The children use social media only through 
parents and their teacher. But, they learned 
the power of communication and how to en-
gage people in a meaningful and valuable 
way. They sold $1 magnets with the winning 
Symbol. ‘‘Every day we looked to see how 
many people had signed the petition, and we 
highlighted, on a map, all the states people 
are from,’’ said Ms. Wilcox, who’s been teach-
ing for 22 years. So, showing a little kindness 
can teach geography and bringing people to-
gether. 
Those are some of the things that kindness 
is about: 
Reaching out beyond ourselves and show-
ing respect and care for others. Their symbol 
builds on the heart as the symbol of love. The 
heart is enclosed in a circle of arrows and that 
reminds me that kindness is more than just a 
noun. Kindness is an ‘‘action’’ word. Kindness 
happens by doing. 
I’m so proud that a class of young people in 
my district could remind us, ‘‘Kindness is al-
ways possible’’ in what they did and in the 
Symbol of Kindness they have given to the 
rest of us as a reminder. 
I have introduced a resolution to recognize 
their work as the Spacecoast Symbol of Kind-
ness. Hopefully, their symbol can be carried 
by our astronauts on some future mission into 
space to spread their message beyond even 
our planet. If the nation needs kindness today, 
we can surely look forward to taking kindness 
with us to the moon, Mars, and beyond. 
Once again, I commend Ms. Wilcox and her 
class. They remind us that kindness is doing 
something for another person without expect-
ing anything in return other than the possibility 
that others will pass on kindness to others. I 
thank the kindergarteners at Tropical Elemen-
tary, for this reminder.

OF 
THE 
FNB COMMUNITY SPIRIT AWARD 
HON. DANIEL MEUSER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect that I rise today to recognize 
Jeannetta Politis of First National Bank of 
Pennsylvania on receiving the FNB Commu-
nity Spirit Award. 
Each year, the First National Bank of Penn-
sylvania presents the FNB Community Spirit 
Award to an employee who provides excellent 
service to customers and contributes positively 
to their community through charitable endeav-
ors. FNB selects two recipients from each re-
gion and donates $4,000 to a charity of their 
choice. 
Ms. Politis serves as one of FNB’s Business 
Banking Relationship Managers and is also a 
dedicated community member with a commit-
ment to volunteerism. She has focused her ef-
forts on helping the next generation, serving 
as a board member for organizations such as 
the Harrisburg Young Professionals, Leader-
ship Harrisburg, and The Joshua Group, a 
non-profit organization focused on the men-
toring and guidance of at-risk youth living in 
the Allison Hill neighborhood of Harrisburg. 
Additionally, Ms. Politis volunteers with the 
Harrisburg Rotary Club and Hospice of Central 
Pennsylvania, caring for those who are most 
in need among us. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-
tives and the citizens of Pennsylvania’s Ninth 
Congressional District, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Jeannetta Politis on 
this great honor and thank her for her dedica-
tion to the betterment of our communities.

ABORTION RIGHTS 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, we are at 
a critical juncture for abortion rights in Amer-
ica. 
Abortion is health care and a fundamental 
right. But, across the street from the Capitol, 
the Supreme Court appears ready to overturn 
precedent to go after reproductive justice. 
June Medical Services v. Russo is the first 
abortion case to be heard by anti-abortion 
Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. 
They could pave the way for states to ban 
abortion for 25 million people in the United 
States. 
So, we are standing up. Because we will not 
be standing by. 
Regardless of where they live or how much 
money they make, individuals deserve the 
right to control their own bodies and future, 
and to get the healthcare that they want and 
need. When women can make decisions 
about their own reproductive healthcare, in-
cluding whether and when to have children, 
they have autonomy over their lives, and their 
economic security. 
So, reproductive justice is about economic 
justice. That is what is under threat.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E269 
March 5, 2020 
And, not just the courts. Opponents of abor-
tion have launched a nationwide, full court 
press against abortion and women’s health. 
Last year, 300 bills were introduced across 
the U.S. to curb or ban abortion. Alabama 
passed an extreme and callous law that would 
force teenage survivors of rape and incest, as 
well as people of any age, to carry a preg-
nancy without their consent. Texas introduced 
a bill to make abortion a capital offense. 
Then, there is the Trump-Pence administra-
tion. Its domestic gag rule insert Donald 
Trump and MIKE PENCE in between a woman 
and her doctor. More than four million women 
and men, including 45,000 in my state, go to 
Title X clinics for their health care services. 
Sixty percent of those women consider it their 
primary care. But, the domestic gag rule bans 
providers from even talking about abortion or 
abortion-related services with their patient, 
even if an abortion is medically necessary. 
Americans want more health care, not less. 
And, abortion is safe and legal, and the law of 
the land. 
So, as the chair of the Labor-Health and 
Human 
Services-Education 
Appropriations 
Subcommittee, I am proud to fight for women 
and families and for reproductive justice. In 
our House Labor-HHS bill, we fought to block 
the domestic gag rule. But the administration 
and the Senate Republicans stopped us. We 
are not giving up. 
Instead, the Democratic Majority of the U.S. 
House of Representatives is fighting for repro-
ductive justice. We have legislation such as 
Congresswoman 
BARBARA
LEE’s 
EACH 
Woman Act. The Hyde Amendment is a dis-
criminatory policy that makes access to abor-
tion dependent on your income. That is wrong, 
and I oppose it. We will continue the fight and 
we will win that fight in the near term to en-
sure that women of color, low income women 
and all women are on equal footing, with re-
gards to reproductive rights. 
Making the decision to continue or end a 
pregnancy is a complex decision and a very 
personal one. Throughout their pregnancy, a 
person must be able to make health decisions 
that are best for their circumstances, including 
whether to end a pregnancy, without inter-
ference from politicians. President Trump does 
not get a veto. 
The Supreme Court should not forget that. 
The American people, and the voters, will not.

TRIBUTE TO MR. DENNIS HOOD 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to express my condolences to 
the family of my friend Dennis Hood, a man 
who liberated himself and believed in fighting 
for the rights of others. 
Unfortunately, I cannot be there with them 
because we are voting on a supplemental 
budget to provide money with which to fight 
the coronavirus, and I figured that I ought to 
be here to perform that duty. Therefore, I have 
asked one of my young staffers, Gerard 
Moorer, to read the following statement at his 
service: 
Dennis Hood lived at ABLA and Lathrop. 
He was actively engaged and involved in the 
activities of these developments. Dennis was 
a colorful character with an outgoing per-
sonality. He never went any place and you 
didn’t not know that he was there. He made 
use of the section 3 provision in the Public 
Housing Act and developed a small construc-
tion company. Dennis argued, protested, 
marched, demonstrated, swore, drank whis-
key, cussed and did everything under the sun 
to try and have his way, and if he could 
speak, I am sure he would say, I did it my 
way. ‘‘For what is a man, what has he got, if 
not himself, then he has naught, to say the 
things he truly feels and not the words of one 
who kneels. The record show I took the 
blows and did it my way.’’ 
Yes, it was Dennis’ way. 
He was my friend and supporter, and I was 
his friend and supporter.

CLAIRE ‘‘NELLIE’’ POOLE

Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life and honor the leg-
acy of the Woodbury Heights, New Jersey 
resident Claire ‘‘Nellie’’ Poole. 
On Tuesday, March 3, 2020, family and 
friends gathered to celebrate the life and 
honor the legacy of Mrs. Claire Poole a resi-
dent of Woodbury Heights, New Jersey, and a 
loving and caring woman who dedicated her 
life to her family, workers and public service. 
Mrs. Claire Poole, ‘‘Nellie’’ as many called 
her, worked for the Camden County Board of 
Social Services as a Social Worker before her 
retirement. In addition to her service with the 
county, Mrs. Claire Poole was heavily involved 
with labor unions and worker’s rights organiza-
tions and served as the President of Women 
of Labor, Chairperson of the Union Organiza-
tion of Social Services, President of CWA 
Local 1084 Union, and served as the 2nd Vice 
President of Central Labor Union-AFL CIO. 
Community and public service were Mrs. 
Claire Poole’s life-long passions. She was a 
member of Woodbury Heights Borough Coun-
cil and was very involved with the Woodbury 
Heights Democratic Club. She even served as 
a delegate to the Democratic National Con-
vention in 1984, 1988 and 2000. In addition to 
her public service and political life, she served 
on numerous United Way campaigns, was a 
former President of the Woodbury Heights 
Senior Club, and was a member of the 
Gloucester County Senior Club. In her reli-
gious life, Mrs. Poole was also involved in St. 
Margaret’s Church where she was part of the 
bereavement committee. 
Mrs. Poole was the wife of the late Joseph 
F. Poole. She was a devoted mother to Val-
erie Dzindzio (Mark) of Clayton, Robert Clay-
ton (Elizabeth) of Woodbury, Maureen Leo 
(Dominick) of Clayton, and step-mother of Jo-
seph ‘‘Michael’’ Poole (the late Diane) of Dept-
ford, James Poole of Woodbury and the late 
Frank Clayton, Jr., Russell Clayton (Theresa) 
and Kevin Clayton. She was the beloved sister 
of Edward Charlton (Theresa) of Collingswood 
and the late Frances Andrews, Teresa Logan 
and Hilda Minderjahn. 
Additionally, she was a loving grandmother 
of 14 and great-grandmother of 11. ‘‘Nellie’’ 
leaves behind many nieces and nephews and 
her cat, Tabitha. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring the life and legacy of Mrs. Claire 
Poole of Woodbury Heights, New Jersey.

SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, March 3, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as a 
strong believer in diplomacy and global co-
operation, I believe it is vitally important for the 
United States to support Taiwan as they seek 
to gain membership in global organizations 
such as the WHA and Interpol. Furthermore, I 
believe that our nation should do what it can 
to allow Taiwan to foster and grow its diplo-
matic relationships around the globe. 
Since 2016, the People’s Republic of China 
has systematically been trying to undermine 
the diplomatic independence of Taiwan on the 
international stage, luring Taiwan’s partners to 
change their allegiance from Taipei to Beijing 
under the ‘‘One China’’ policy. The People’s 
Republic of China has also been blocking Tai-
wan’s access to global organizations such as 
the World Health Organization. We have only 
recently started to see some of the negative 
impacts of these actions. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States should con-
tinue to stand strong with our democratic part-
ner and encourage other allies to strengthen 
their relationship with Taipei.

OF 
CASS-MORGAN 
COUNTY FARM BUREAU 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor a remarkable organization, the Cass- 
Morgan County Farm Bureau. The Cass-Mor-
gan County Farm Bureau in central Illinois is 
a vital organization in the area that promotes 
agricultural prosperity. After many years of 
success and service, the Cass-Morgan County 
Farm Bureau is celebrating their 50th anniver-
sary. 
The Cass-Morgan County Farm Bureau was 
chartered on March 2, 1970, to unite farmers 
in the area and advocate for central Illinois ag-
riculture collectively. Today, the members of 
the organization work hard to support the 
community and economy throughout the coun-
ty. 
The Cass-Morgan County Farm Bureau pro-
vides a voice for farmers, promotes the devel-
opment of agriculture, and educates and em-
powers future leaders in the industry. Addition-
ally, Cass-Morgan County Farm Bureau co-
ordinates with other associations and agencies 
to promote the well-being and interests of its 
members. 
Illinois has become a major economic force 
within the agricultural sector because of farm 
bureaus like Cass-Morgan County that come 
together and enhance opportunities for farm-
ers, their families, and the community. I ex-
tend my sincere congratulations to the Cass- 
Morgan County Farm Bureau for their out-
standing accomplishments and contributions to

Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Paul Dowen for receiving the 
Adirondack Regional Chamber of Commerce 
J. Walter Juckett Community Service Award. 
Paul grew up in Saratoga Springs and made 
his way up to the Adirondack region in 1976 
to attend Adirondack Community College. 
Upon his graduation from Castleton State Col-
lege in 1980 he returned to Glens Falls and 
started his accounting career with the CPA 
film of Silverstein and Loftus. Paul now has 
over thirty years of public accounting experi-
ence 
and 
is 
the 
Managing 
Partner 
of 
Whittemore, Dowen and Ricciardelli, LLP. 
Paul joined the Glens Falls Rotary Club in 
1982 and has continued his membership and 
commitment to the organization for almost 40 
years. He has also volunteered in leadership 
positions for a number of other community and 
charitable organizations. He currently serves 
on the boards of SUNY Adirondack Founda-
tion, the House of Grace of the Adirondacks, 
the Adirondack Hockey Coalition and Christ 
Church United Methodist. 
Paul Dowen demonstrates the hard working, 
community minded nature that the North 
Country is known for. On behalf of New York’s 
21st District, I would like to congratulate Paul 
for this well-deserved recognition. I look for-
ward to his future success.

HONORING DETECTIVE II SHAREN 
S. STALLWORTH 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor the retirement of De-
tective II Sharen S. Stallworth and the dedica-
tion to duty and professionalism with which 
she has served the City of Los Angeles for 32 
years and 6 months. 
Detective II Sharen S. Stallworth was ap-
pointed to the Los Angeles Police Department 
(LAPD) on November 16, 1987, and upon 
completion of her time in the academy, re-
ported to the Wilshire Division. She provided 
leadership on a variety of coveted assign-
ments in the Division including the Mental 
Evaluation Unit, Burglary Special Section, and 
Youth Program Unit and Abuse Child Section. 
Detective Stallworth was also a member of 
the board of the International Association of 
Financial Crimes Investigators, the California 
Financial Crimes Investigators Association, 
and the Los Angeles Organized Retail Crime 
Association. With her immense experience, 
she is considered a subject matter expert 
(SME) regarding Pawn Brokers and Financial 
Crimes Investigations. 
Additionally, over the past 15 years, Detec-
tive Stallworth served as a Peer Counselor for 
LAPD, giving back to her community by men-
toring detectives and younger officers. Her de-
votion to the City of Los Angeles and beyond 
will undoubtedly leave a lasting impact. 
Detective Stallworth is the daughter of the 
proud parents Luther Scales and Mary 
Stallworth of Pomona, California. 
For her remarkable accomplishments, it is 
my honor to recognize Detective II Sharen S. 
Stallworth on the House floor today. Her dec-
ades of commitment and contributions to the 
City of Los Angeles are worthy of admiration.

Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect that I rise today to recognize 
Steve Staman of First National Bank of Penn-
sylvania on receiving the FNB Community 
Spirit Award. 
Each year, the First National Bank of Penn-

Mr. Staman serves as a Regional Commer-
cial Loan Manager serving Berks, Schuylkill, 
Lancaster and York Counties. A founding 
Board Member and dedicated volunteer for the 
North Museum of Nature and Science, Mr. 
Staman has devoted countless hours to the 
museum’s governance and development. He 
has also been active in the Lancaster Rotary 
Club since 1996, most recently serving as 
their Paul Harris Fellow. As a community-fo-
cused employee, Mr. Staman often assists 
FNB’s local efforts including wrapping gifts for 
Toys for Tots and participating in the Coats for

munity is in need, Mr. Staman answers the 
call. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Representa-

RECOGNIZING THE DEDICATION OF 
THE NEW ST. JAMES HOSPITAL 
IN HORNELL, NEW YORK 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the dedication of the new St. James 
Hospital in Hornell, New York. 
St. James Hospital was founded in 1890 
and has provided healthcare services to resi-
dents in the Hornell and surrounding commu-
nities for one hundred and thirty years. It has 
grown and changed over the years into the 
full-service hospital it is today. 
The hospital is an affiliate of the University 
of Rochester Medical Center and provides a 
variety of services including a twenty-four hour 
emergency department, general surgery, or-
thopedics and rehab services, imaging and lab 
services and a walk-in clinic. The hospital has 
also partnered with various regional health 
care entities such as UR Medicine; Loyola Re-
covery Foundation and Oak Orchard Health in 
order to provide the best care for area resi-
dents. 
During the long history of the hospital, we 
were glad to stand with the hospital to help 
with issues when they arose. We were proud

to be instrumental in keeping inpatient serv-
ices here through cooperation with other 
stakeholders, and we are equally as proud to 
see this new facility come to fruition. 
The new facility is a state-of-the-art hospital 
with emergency and surgical services, fifteen 
inpatient rooms, an infusion clinic, MRI serv-
ices and other imaging services, a new cafe-
teria, gift shop and more. This eighty-seven 
thousand square-foot facility will be an asset 
and treasure in the Hornell community. 
I cannot thank the doctors, medical profes-
sionals, board members, administration and 
other staff members enough for the work they 
do in the Hornell community. They have saved 
lives, provided excellent care for a plethora of 
years and we are all grateful in the Twenty- 
Third Congressional District of New York for 
the work they do each and every day. I con-
gratulate St. James Hospital on the new facil-
ity and wish them many more years of extraor-
dinary healthcare services. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body join me to recognize the dedication of 
the new St. James Hospital in Hornell, New 
York.

RIGHTS FOR TRANSPORTATION 
SECURITY OFFICERS ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 4, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise to 
speak in strong support of H.R. 1140, the 
Rights for Transportation Security Officers Act 
of 2020, which will create civil service protec-
tions for TSA employees that are long over-
due. 
H.R. 1140, mandates the conversion of all 
covered employees and positions within the 
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
to the provisions of title 5, United State Code. 
The bill represents a longstanding priority 
for Chairman THOMPSON, the bill’s author, and 
my own as a former chair of the Homeland 
Security Committee’s Subcommittee on Trans-
portation Security to extend the rights and pro-
tections afford to all federal government em-
ployees to TSA personnel. 
Several versions of the bill have been intro-
duced over the past decade, but this Con-
gress is the first time the bill has received 
overwhelming, bipartisan support, with 236 co-
sponsors including 10 Republicans. 
The legislation curtails TSA’s broad authori-
ties to create and control its personnel sys-
tems, instead requiring TSA to abide by the 
provisions of title 5 which regulate personnel 
systems for most Federal agencies. 
The bill would provide TSA employees with 
the workforce protections and benefits avail-
able to most other Federal workers. 
The bill sets forth transition rules to protect 
the rate of pay and other rights of TSA em-
ployees during a transition to title 5. 
The bill also requires the Secretary of 
Homeland Security to consult with the appro-
priate labor organizations to carry out the tran-
sition. 
This bill does not affect prohibitions against 
disloyalty and asserting the right to strike 
against the federal government. 
The bill also extends the timeline for the 
transition from 60 days to a more realistic 180 
days, and it contains language to protect em-
ployees with grievances or disciplinary actions 
pending during the transition. 
On the morning of September 11, 2001, 
nearly 3,000 people were killed in a series of 
coordinated terrorist attacks in New York, 
Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
The attacks resulted in the creation of the 
Transportation Security Administration, which 
was designed to prevent similar attacks in the 
future by removing the responsibility for trans-
portation security from private entities. 
The Aviation and Transportation Security 
Act, passed by the 107th Congress and 
signed on November 19, 2001, established 
TSA just 2 months following the September 
11, 2001 attacks. 
The urgent need to provide a response to 
the available security threat was facing meant 
that much of the work to provide administra-
tive structure and integration measures that 
would have woven in the civil service protec-
tions now be added did not occur at that time. 
The TSA’s mission is to protect the nation’s 
transportation systems to ensure freedom of 
movement for people and commerce. 
The work of the TSA is a frontline Depart-
ment of Homeland Security and it is not 
easy—it can in fact be very dangerous. 
Like many of my colleagues, I recall the 
shooting incident at LAX that killed Gerardo 
Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer 
killed in the line of duty; and the machete at-
tack at the Louis Armstrong New Orleans 
International Airport that resulted in injuries to 
Senior Transportation Security Officer Carol 
Richel. 
These incidents only highlight the difficult 
work that the men and women of the TSA 
must perform each day to keep our nation’s 
airports and flights safe. 
The Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) supports several key parts of the U.S. 
coronavirus response. 
The TSA is responsible for: enforcing the 
travel restrictions for all flights that are car-
rying individuals who have recently traveled 
from China; notifying passengers and travelers 
of risks of contracting the virus; and coordi-
nating with air carriers and airports to discuss 
government actions and seek input (TSA). 
Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful 
procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, 
low morale, and security gaps within the 
Agency are causes for concern. 
TSA has consistently struggled with low mo-
rale across the workforce, ranking 303 out of 
305 government agencies in 2016. 
Low morale has a nexus to the high turn-
over rate within the ranks of Transportation 
Security Officers (TSOs). 
TSOs represent 70 percent of the TSA 
workforce, yet have been denied full collective 
bargaining rights, whistleblower protections, 
and opportunities to effectively raise issues in 
dispute to an independent third party, such as 
the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
Additionally, TSOs are subject to a pay and 
performance system that does not track with 
the General Services (GS) wage system, the 
primary wage system for Federal workers. 
It is past time to make the changes provided 
by H.R. 1140, so the TSA workforce is treated 
equally to other federal employees with the 
power to advance and expand their opportuni-
ties as government employees. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for 
H.R. 1140.

HONORING 
THE 
BALLSTON 
SPA 
VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS 
POST 358 ON THEIR CENTENNIAL 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Ballston Spa Veterans of 
Foreign Wars Post 358 on their 100th anniver-
sary. 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United 
States (VFW) is a nonprofit veterans service 
organization that traces its roots back to the 
Spanish-American War of 1898. Veterans re-
turning home following the war in 1902 found 
themselves with little or no support from the 
government, even those with severe wounds 
and permanent disabilities. From this vacuum 
emerged the VFW, whose membership now 
stands at more than 1.6 million. The VFW 
made significant contributions to the establish-
ment of the Veterans Administration and con-
tinues to advocate strongly for veterans to this 
day. At the local level, each post makes a 
positive impact on the broader community. 
Post 358 sponsors and contributes to many 
local charitable events and organizations in-
cluding elementary school literacy programs, 
Memorial 
Day 
Parades, 
junior 
baseball 
leagues and the Brookside Museum. They 
maintain 
strong 
friendships 
with 
annual 
barbeques and outings for members, while 
supporting each other in times of need. 
The VFW’s vision is to ensure ‘‘veterans are 
respected for their service, always receive 
their earned entitlements, and are recognized 
for the sacrifices they and their loved ones 
have made on behalf of this great country.’’ I 
echo this sentiment and will continue to work 
with all veterans’ groups to realize that vision. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I want 
to congratulate President Karen Shea and all 
the members of VFW Post 358 on this mile-
stone and thank them for their century-long 
tradition of service to North Country veterans.

TRIBUTE TO CONSTANCE 
SEYMOUR ULRICH 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding in-
dividual, Constance Seymour Ulrich, who 
passed away at the age of 87 on February 29, 
2020. Connie, as she was known, was a lov-
ing wife and mother and she will be deeply 
missed. 
Connie was born in Eugene, Oregon on 
March 22, 1932, the first daughter of Darle 
and Vada Belle Seymour. Her parents owned 
the iconic Seymour’s Cafe in downtown Eu-
gene by the University of Oregon Campus. 
She grew up in Eugene, attending grade 
school near the MacKenzie River in Vida, Or-
egon where her father owned Heavens Gate 
Cabins. After the war, she and her family 
moved back to Eugene and she attended 
Roosevelt Junior High and then Eugene High 
School, graduating with the Class of 1950. 
Connie attended the University of Oregon, ma-
joring in Music and was a proud member of 
the Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority. 
After college, she moved down to San Fran-
cisco where she ultimately joined American 
Airlines as a Stewardess. It was while working 
for the airlines that she met her future hus-
band, Edward ‘‘Duke’’ Ulrich. They soon mar-
ried and immediately transferred to Kansas 
City, Missouri and subsequently to Chicago, Il-
linois. She was then excited to return to Cali-
fornia where they settled in Sunnyvale, the 
heart of Silicon Valley. They raised their two 
children, Gregory and Linda and resided there 
for 47 years. 
Connie, blessed with a beautiful soprano 
voice, loved music and would frequently burst 
into an operatic solo. She enjoyed horseback 
riding as a young girl, and loved all animals, 
especially cats and dogs. I had the good for-
tune of getting to know Connie through Linda 
who was an integral part of my DC staff for 
many years. I can tell you that Connie had an 
infectious zest for life and a sparkle that drew 
people to her. I will long remember her sense 
of fun and humor which so clearly live on 
through her daughter. 
Connie’s husband, Duke, predeceased her 
in death, as did her son Gregory, and more 
recently her sister, Kathryn Seymour of Eu-
gene. Connie is survived by Linda and son-in- 
law John ‘‘JY’’ Yeagley of Vienna, Virginia. A 
celebration of her life will be held in McLean, 
Virginia. She will make Alta Mesa Memorial 
Park in Palo Alto her final resting place and 
will join her husband and son. I extend my 
heartfelt condolences to my dear friend Linda 
and to all those who knew Connie. Although 
she may no longer be with us, she will con-
tinue to have a lasting impact on the lives of 
her family and community.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
PLEASANT 
PLAINS 
GIRLS 
BASKETBALL 
TEAM ON WINNING THE ILLINOIS 
2A STATE TITLE 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, today, I 
would like to recognize the Pleasant Plains 
High School girls’ basketball team on winning 
the 2020 Class 2A state title. 
Last Saturday, at Redbird Arena in Normal, 
Illinois, the Pleasant Plains Cardinals defeated 
the two-time defending champion Chicago 
Marshall Commandos in a performance domi-
nated by Pleasant Plain’s defensive efforts. 
The Cardinals held Chicago Marshall to 32 
percent shooting and forced 12 turnovers in 
the game, winning by a final score of 43–37. 
The Cardinals victory was not without drama, 
as the Cardinal’s allowed a 13-point fourth- 
quarter lead dwindle to just 1-point, but on the 
strength of strong senior leadership, the Car-
dinals were able to seal the game and bring 
a state championship home to Pleasant 
Plains. 
For the first time in program history, Pleas-
ant Plains girls’ basketball won the IHSA state 
championship. Pleasant Plains’ newfound suc-
cess on the hardwood is a testament to the 
leadership of Coach TJ Fraase and the deter-
mination of the young women he coaches. 
The Pleasant Plains girls’ basketball team 
has made all of central Illinois proud with their 
accomplishments this season, finishing with a 
28–3 record. Each girl’s commitment to their 
team and their community is truly inspiring. 
Congratulations to Coach Fraase and the 
Pleasant Plain’s Cardinals for their remarkable 
state championship win.

CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCY AS-

HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce 
the 
Northern 
Mariana 
Islands 
Coronavirus Emergency Assistance Act which 
would provide $100 million to the Common-
wealth of the Northern Mariana Islands to re-
spond to the severe loss of revenues for gov-
ernment 
operations 
resulting 
from 
the 
coronavirus’ impact to our tourism industry. 
The funds will help avert the disruption of es-
sential health and other public services to the 
people of my isolated district. 
The coronavirus outbreak has resulted in 
the loss of thousands of lives and disrupted 
commerce worldwide but its impact has hit 
tourism-dependent jurisdictions like the Com-
monwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands 
particularly hard. Major hotels have less than 
30 percent occupancy. Airlines serving our is-
lands have cut routes. As a result, less funds 
will be available to provide health and other 
public services for the people of my district. 
Our Commonwealth’s governor, Ralph Torres, 
declared a state of significant emergency on 
January 29 and implemented across-the-board 
budget cuts and austerity measures including 
a 20 percent cut to teachers’ salaries and a 4- 
day school week. Last week, Acting Governor 
Arnold Palacios extended the state of emer-
gency for another 30 days. Today, Governor 
Torres declared a price freeze on food, water, 
clothing, emergency supplies as well as fuel. 
Due to forces beyond our control, the people 
of my district are facing an emergency that re-
quires me as their sole representative in Con-
gress to act now and provide emergency as-
sistance measures to ensure their health and 
safety. 
Yesterday, the House passed an $8 billion 
emergency supplemental funding bill that will 
help every part of our country respond to the 
coronavirus. However, these funds cannot be 
used to support general government oper-
ations such as public education. This is why I 
am introducing the Northern Mariana Islands 
Coronavirus Emergency Assistance Act to pro-
vide $100 million in fiscal support to ensure all 
members of my community, especially our 
seniors and children, can continue to access 
the care and education essential to their 
health, safety and families’ well-being.

TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF 
ATTORNEY STEVE FARBER 
HON. DIANA DeGETTE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 5, 2020 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congressman ED
PERL-
MUTTER, Congressman JASON
CROW, and 
Congressman JOE NEGUSE, to recognize the 
life and achievements of Steve Farber who 
passed away on Wednesday, March 4, 2020. 
Steve’s life was the quintessential example 
of the American dream. Raised in North Den-
ver, he overcame humble beginnings in order 
to found one of the city’s most renowned law 
firms, along with the help of his childhood best 
friends Norm Brownstein and Jack Hyatt. 
Steve’s influence is seen everywhere in Den-
ver, from helping negotiate with the City of 
Denver to make Denver International Airport a 
hub for United Airlines to securing funds for 
major highway projects. Steve represented 
some of the city’s most popular sports teams, 
and was the key influencer who secured a 
new stadium for the Denver Broncos. 
However, even as Steve built a successful 
business, he never forgot the importance of 
helping others. He supported innumerable 
charitable 
organizations 
and 
philanthropic 
work. In fact, one of his special causes was 
educating the public about the life-saving ben-
efits of organ donation. Many years ago, when 
Mr. Farber was diagnosed with kidney disease 
that required him to undergo an organ trans-
plant, he realized the devastating toll that pa-
tients faced while waiting on transplant lists. 
With the kind of single-minded grit and deter-
mination that he was well known for, Mr. 
Farber started the American Transplant Foun-
dation in Denver to help save lives and sup-
port transplant patients and their families. A 
decade later, the organization is credited with 
bringing together almost 500 organ donors 
and recipients. 
Steve was an open and accessible friend to 
all. An active Democrat, he was an integral 
force in the party for years. But countless Re-
publicans also called him friend. On a per-
sonal note, Steve was one of the first political 
activists to support me in my career, and has 
been a trusted friend and confidant throughout 
my career. 
Steve was a one-of-a-kind Denverite; every-
one knew him and respected him. He worked 
alongside national leaders, local mayors, cor-
porate executives and everyday citizens just 
the same. His friends and colleagues remem-
ber him as a ‘‘legend’’ and a ‘‘giant.’’ He was 
all that and more. He was a beloved husband 
for 48 years as well as a devoted father to 3 
sons and grandfather to 6 precious grand-
children. 
Steve Farber’s hands have left an indelible 
imprint on the state, and his legacy will live 
on. Our heartfelt condolences go out to his 
family, his friends and colleagues in Denver’s 
legal community and all Coloradans who 
mourn this terrible loss.
