PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of us all, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
Continue to bless those who labor 
still to find agreement on omnibus and 
further coronavirus relief legislation. 
In the wake of the work of the elec-
toral college, and the confirmation of 
our new President and Vice-President- 
elect, may our Nation now be more fo-
cused on what lies ahead. 
Bring success to the work of Con-
gress. Bring success to the rapid dis-
tribution of vaccines, and confidence to 
those who hesitate to trust, though 
history has given them cause for that 
hesitation. Help us, O Lord, to learn to 
trust and rely upon one another as citi-
zens of this country. 
Comfort those who suffer from the 
coronavirus, and those who mourn for 
lost loved ones during these holy sea-
sons when, in normal times, families 
and friends have always gathered. Help 
us to look forward in hope and peace. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

avoid speaking harshly. 
Lord, give them such respect for one 
another that they will assume the best 
motives for the actions of their col-
leagues. Help our Senators to remem-
ber that You are the judge of the uni-
verse who sees everything, whether 
good or bad. 
Lord, You can even see the motiva-
tions of our hearts. Inspire us all to 
permit our thoughts, words, and ac-
tions to be acceptable to You. 
And, Lord, we respect the conclu-

HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent for 1 minute in 
morning business, please. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

U.S. SERVICEMEMBERS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
we are probably all guilty of not re-
membering the sacrifices of our men 
and women in uniform, but particu-
larly during this time of year, it is es-
pecially difficult for them to be away 
from friends and family. 
Right now, there are almost 1,500 
Iowans deployed overseas with the 
Iowa National Guard, just as one exam-
ple of a group we should be thinking 
about. And I think about this group be-
cause that 1,500 includes 1 member of 
my own staff. 
We rely on our brave men and women 
in uniform to protect our way of life, 
our democracy, and the liberties we 
cherish. The sacrifices they make are 
not taken for granted and won’t be for-
gotten by future generations. All of our 
Nation’s 
servicemembers 
and 
their 
families will be in my prayers and, I 
hope, the prayers of all of my col-
leagues during this holiday season. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER

f 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
over the last 4 years, our country has 
benefited from a Presidential term 
filled with major accomplishments. 
President Donald Trump has repeat-
edly surprised the skeptics, confounded 
his critics, and delivered significant 
policy victories that have strengthened 
our country. 
Case in point, back in May, when the 
President set the goal of finding a pan-
demic-ending vaccine by the end of this 
year, his timeline was literally dis-
missed by people who assumed they 
knew better. 
Here is one quote: ‘‘Trump promises 
coronavirus vaccine by the end of 
year,’’ scoffed one headline, ‘‘but his 
own experts temper expectations.’’ 
‘‘Fact check’’ complained another 
headline, ‘‘Coronavirus vaccine could 
come this year, Trump says. Experts 
say he needs a ‘miracle’ to be right.’’ 
Well, with the genius of science, sup-
port from Congress, and the bold lead-
ership of the Trump administration, 
that medical miracle arrived right on 
schedule. Americans on the frontlines 
are receiving vaccinations as we speak. 
This episode offers a kind of micro-
cosm of the last 4 years. On so many 
subjects—from economic prosperity to 
foreign policy, to protecting American 
families—the skeptics doubted him. 
The critics derided him. But President 
Trump has delivered. 
When President Trump ran for office, 
he promised to help open a new chapter 
for working families. After 8 years of 
failed 
policies 
that 
concentrated 
wealth and optimism among the lucky 
few, prosperity was going to flow to all 
kinds of workers in all kinds of com-
munities, he said. And that is exactly 
what happened. 
Before this pandemic spread from 
China and the world had to slam on the 
brakes, the American people had the 
best job market in living memory. 
With help from the policies of Presi-
dent Trump and Republicans in Con-
gress, American workers dynamited 
the stagnation that experts had said 
was ‘‘the new normal.’’ Unemployment 
hit a 50-year low. Capital markets hit 
record highs. 
And this time, all kinds of Americans 
got to share in the gains. We saw earn-
ings grow faster for workers than for 
managers, faster for the bottom 25 
than for the top 25. This success was 
fueled in part by the policy leadership 
of President Trump. 
This administration pursued bold 
regulatory changes. Once-in-a-genera-
tion tax reform had eluded prior lead-
ers. This President signed it into law in 
his first year. 
And together we repealed the worst 
part of ObamaCare. The unfair indi-
vidual mandate was zeroed out. 
President Trump also took historic 
steps to strengthen the future of our

trade with the world. He secured the 
historic United States-Mexico-Canada 
Agreement and the bilateral tax trea-
ties with partners in Europe and in 
Asia. 
A nation this productive needs plenty 
of energy to keep it going. Fortu-
nately, President Trump and his ad-
ministration ended the ideological war 
on fossil fuels and hit the accelerator 
on ‘‘all of the above’’ American energy 
dominance. In the last 4 years, we sur-
passed Saudi Arabia in oil production. 
We saw energy exports exceed energy 
imports for the first year in almost 70 
years. Meanwhile, we saw CO2 emis-
sions fall, along with other harmful 
pollutants. That energy independence 
has 
dramatically 
strengthened 
our 
hand with respect to the rest of the 
world, particularly the Middle East. 
So speaking of the Middle East, 
President Trump wasted little time 
pulling back from the prior adminis-
tration’s disastrous ‘‘Iran deal.’’ His 
team eliminated daylight between us 
and Israel and repaired our relation-
ships with Arab partners. And he 
aligned these relationships around our 
common shared interests—countering 
threats like radical Islamic terrorists 
and Iranian aggression. 
Under President Trump’s command, 
our forces took terrorist leaders like 
al-Baghdadi and Soleimani off the bat-
tlefield. The physical caliphate that 
ISIS established on the previous Presi-
dent’s watch was destroyed. 
All of this paved the way for the 
Abraham accords, the historic normal-
ization of relationships between Israel 
and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and, 
most recently, Morocco. And the po-
tential is there for more on the hori-
zon. 
Now, the Middle East isn’t the only 
place where the Trump administration 
has shored up our footing on the world 
stage. Our 45th Commander in Chief 
sought out to rebuild and modernize 
our military and to move our foreign 
policy from a chapter of weakness and 
apology into a renewed posture of 
strength. 
Four years later, we have a new na-
tional defense strategy to compete 
with and deter adversaries like Russia 
and China. We have rebuilt the mili-
tary and invested in new technologies 
to ensure America keeps our edge in 
everything from cyber to space, to ad-
vanced weapons system. 
The President’s leadership does not 
stop with those who are currently serv-
ing. He also signed into law the his-
toric VA MISSION Act to ensure our 
dedication to the men and women in 
uniform does not end when their tours 
conclude. 
So, clearly, the list of American ac-
complishments since 2016 is nearly end-
less. There are the many miles of new 
protections on our southern border. At 
one point, apprehensions at the border 
hit their lowest level since the 1970s. 
Essential causes, like religious lib-
erty and the most vulnerable, the un-
born, have had a champion in this ad-
ministration instead of an adversary. 
There have been historic new steps to 
conserve our national treasures, like 
the Great American Outdoors Act. 
And perhaps most important of all, 
President Trump nominated—and this 
Senate confirmed—three outstanding 
Supreme Court Justices, along with 
more than 220 more article III Federal 
judges. These are brilliant, young, con-
stitutionalist men and women in life-
time appointments who will renew the 
judiciary for a new generation—all be-
cause President Trump knows we need 
judges who respect the essential but 
limited job description the Framers 
wrote for our third branch of govern-
ment. 
So as you can see, it would take far 
more than one speech to catalogue all 
the major wins the Trump administra-
tion has helped deliver for the Amer-
ican people. The outsider who swore he 
would shake up Washington and lead 
our country to new accomplishments 
both at home and abroad proceeded to 
do exactly that. 
President Trump and Vice President 
MIKE PENCE deserve our thanks and our 
gratitude for their tireless work and 
their essential roles in all of these vic-
tories and in many more. 
f 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
6 weeks ago, Americans voted in this 
year’s general election. The legal and 
constitutional processes have contin-
ued to play out since then. 
Yesterday, electors met in all 50 
States. So, as of this morning, our 
country has officially a President-elect 
and a Vice President-elect. 
Many millions of us had hoped the 
Presidential election would yield a dif-
ferent result. But our system of gov-
ernment has processes to determine 
who will be sworn in on January 20. 
The electoral college has spoken. 
So, today, I want to congratulate 
President-Elect Joe Biden. The Presi-
dent-elect is no stranger to the Senate. 
He has devoted himself to public serv-
ice for many years. 
I also want to congratulate the Vice 
President-elect, our colleague from 
California, Senator HARRIS. Beyond our 
differences, all Americans can take 
pride that our nation has a female Vice 
President-elect for the very first time. 
I look toward to finishing out the 
next 36 days strong with President 
Trump. Our Nation needs us to add an-
other bipartisan chapter to this record 
of achievement. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDENT-ELECT BIDEN 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, if 
you follow the U.S. Senate, which, of 
course, many of us do, there was a 
noteworthy moment this morning. It 
was actually a prayer by our Chaplain, 
Barry Black. In that prayer, he ac-
knowledged and called for the blessings 
of God on the President-Elect Joe 
Biden 
and 
Vice 
President-Elect 
KAMALA HARRIS. 
The reason that was noteworthy is 
that has been a contested issue among 
politicians on Capitol Hill for weeks as 
to whether or not Joe Biden could be 
described 
as 
President-elect. 
Many 
have stepped forward and said yes, but 
many resisted. The acknowledgement 
by the Chaplain caught me a little by 
surprise this morning. And I came to 
the floor to hear the Republican leader, 
Senator MCCONNELL, go through an ac-
counting of the Trump Presidency and 
all of his achievements and then con-
cluded by acknowledging as well that 
we have a President-elect in Joe Biden. 
I believe that that reflected the reality 
of the November 3 election and the fi-
nality of the electoral college decisions 
being made across the Nation in so 
many States. 
I thank those who have stepped for-
ward to acknowledge the reality of a 
new President and hope that they will 
join me in an effort to do our best to 
make certain that his tenure is a suc-
cess, not just for him personally and 
the Vice President but for our Nation. 
We deserve nothing less. 
It is a long story, these last few 
weeks since November 3 and what has 
happened across America. I don’t think 
anyone could have predicted that we 
would see the divisive reaction that we 
have seen, nor could anyone have pre-
dicted what happened yesterday. Some 
States had to take extraordinary meas-
ures to protect electoral college elec-
tors—what used to be a routine, some-
what tedious and boring mission. It re-
sulted in the closing of legislative

buildings in Michigan to the public 
and, according to press reports, cred-
ible threats of violence. In Arizona, 
electors met in an undisclosed location 
to safely cast their votes. These meas-
ures followed a last-ditch effort by 17 
Republican attorneys general and more 
than half of the House Republican cau-
cus joining in a lawsuit and accom-
panying an amicus brief before the Su-
preme Court, which incredibly argued 
that the Court should nullify the votes 
of more than 20 million Americans. 
These ludicrous arguments couldn’t 
hide the true justification for joining 
this effort to undermine our democ-
racy. The people who were protesting 
simply don’t like the results of the 2020 
election, and they don’t want to turn 
their backs on President Trump. 
The 
conservative-leaning 
Supreme 
Court summarily dismissed this effort 
outright, rejecting the lawsuit in an 
order on Friday evening, wasting no 
time in doing it. Despite repeated and 
forceful judicial rejections of their 
baseless allegations of fraud at at-
tempts to nullify the votes of Ameri-
cans, only 27 Congressional Repub-
licans would publicly acknowledge the 
obvious President-elect of the United 
States, Joe Biden, as of last week. 
Now that the electoral college has 
spoken, more Congressional Repub-
licans are finally stepping up. The fact 
that it took 6 weeks for my colleagues 
to recognize reality and stop under-
mining our Democratic process is sad 
and disappointing. When we were sworn 
in as Members of Congress, we took a 
simple oath: support and defend the 
Constitution 
of 
the United States 
against all enemies, foreign and domes-
tic. It is not an oath to one person, nor 
one President; it is not conditional if 
one receives enough angry phone calls; 
it is not dependent on whether the re-
sponsibilities are difficult; and it is 
certainly not optional if one has to 
face a more challenging electorate. 
And yet, with the exception of only a 
few in this Senate Chamber, the silence 
in upholding this oath in the face of 
President Trump’s blatant attempts to 
undermine our democracy has been 
overwhelming. 
Just compare it to the courage shown 
by State and local election officials 
across the United States, including 
many Republicans, who always hasten 
to add that they had voted for Presi-
dent Trump; they were disappointed in 
the election of Joe Biden; but the elec-
tion in their State, by their measure, 
was honest and fair. They don’t enjoy 
the perks or protections we have here 
in Congress, but they stepped up and 
spoke up, and I respect them for it— 
proud Americans of both parties under 
personal threat for their integrity and 
defending an American election that 
the President of the United States 
wants overturned. 
Senator MURPHY, the junior Senator 
from Connecticut, came to the floor on 
Friday and spoke eloquently about this 
threat to American democracy that 
has been playing out in plain sight— 
the blatant and shameful attempt to 
use the power of the Presidency to 
overturn a free and fair election, an 
election which is the foundation of our 
democracy. Senator MURPHY reminded 
us about the fragility of our democracy 
and how it should never ever be taken 
for granted. He warned about collabo-
rating in silence as these efforts are 
made to destroy it. ‘‘How Democracies 
Die.’’ The poignant remarks and the 
outrageous actions of recent weeks re-
minded me of a dinner I hosted with 
the authors of a powerful book, ‘‘How 
Democracies Die.’’ The authors, Steven 
Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, detail ex-
amples in which democracies are weak-
ened, collapsed, and even destroyed. I 
recommend it as urgent reading to my 
colleagues in the Senate at this mo-
ment in our history. They highlighted 
the critical role of established political 
leaders in standing up, or failing to 
stand up, in key moments when events 
or persons threaten their democracies. 
Venezuela, in the early 1990s—the 
key 
establishment 
party 
leader 
opportunistically sided with Hugo Cha-
vez after a coup attempt, devastat-
ingly, giving Chavez critical legit-
imacy he then used to gain power and 
bring his country to its current state of 
decline. I believe we have such a mo-
ment here that demands leaders of 
both parties to carry out their oaths of 
office and defend our treasured democ-
racy. Quite simply, silence is unaccept-
able. 
I am glad for what Senator MCCON-
NELL said this morning on the floor of 
the Senate. Perhaps Chaplain Black in-
spired him and will inspire others to 
step up and speak the truth. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, on a separate 
issue, I have given a big part of my life 
to this institution, the Senate, and I 
respect what we have been able to do 
on many occasions. Through honest 
give-and-take 
and 
compromise, 
we 
have been able to bring legislation to 
this floor to debate it, to consider 
amendments, to pass the legislation, 
and, ultimately, not only make a law 
but change the lives of Americans. We 
are at that moment where we need it 
again. And 10 of us—5 Democrats, 5 Re-
publicans, as well as House Members— 
decided 3 weeks ago that enough was 
enough; we needed to show some lead-
ership and try to work out a com-
promise between us for another COVID 
relief package. You see, it has been 9 
months since we passed what was 
known as the CARES Act on the floor 
of the Senate, 96 to 0—overwhelming, 
unanimous, 
bipartisan 
decision—to 
spend about $3 trillion not only to fight 
the pandemic but to restore our econ-
omy. 
Thank goodness we did. It really gave 
us an opportunity to do something for 
America when it desperately needed it. 
We thought that the threat of the pan-
demic would soon ebb away, but it did 
not. It was not gone in 6 months, and it 
isn’t gone today. In fact, in some 
places in America, it is worse now than 
ever. My State of Illinois, despite the 
heroic efforts of my Governor and 
many others, is suffering with infec-
tions, hospitalizations, and, sadly, too 
many deaths. That is the reality of 
where we are today. 
So this group of 10—5 Democrats, 5 
Republicans—has been meeting for 3 
weeks. We even met on Thanksgiving 
Day. We did a Zoom call and had some 
conversation about a phase of this that 
might be important for us to consider. 
I tell you that because we did produce 
a work product—one that I think is 
worthy of consideration immediately 
on the floor of the Senate. It was an ef-
fort to reach a spending target of $908 
billion to provide immediate assistance 
across the board in the United States, 
to 
extend 
unemployment 
benefits 
where they are desperately needed; to 
give help to businesses—some $300 bil-
lion in new lending authority; to pro-
vide additional funds for SNAP, the 
food stamp program, which many des-
perate families turn to in order to feed 
their children; help to our farmers; 
help to the renters who would be facing 
eviction under their leases if we were 
to do nothing; help to hospitals and 
nursing homes and clinics, for we all 
know they are on the frontline of this 
battle; money for the testing of those 
who suspect they are infected with 
COVID–19; and more resources for the 
logistics of vaccinations. 
The CDFI Program is an effort to ex-
tend lending authority, particularly in 
desperate communities that are bat-
tling both poverty as well as this pan-
demic. There is $5 billion for mental 
health, and we certainly know we need 
it, for the psychological pressure that 
America is facing is obvious in so many 
ways. There is over $80 billion in edu-
cation and $10 billion in childcare. We 
can’t overlook the fact that many 
can’t return to work because there is 
no childcare that they trust with their 
kids. There is help, as well, for expand-
ing broadband. As our kids have to 
turn to remote learning in many places 
in America, broadband has to become a 
fact of life across this Nation. There is 
$45 billion in the whole transportation 
system network that has been dev-
astated by this economic downturn. 
There is $10 billion for those in our 
Postal Service. They are working hard-
er than ever, and we want to make sure 
that the men and women of the Postal 
Service, who do such a remarkable job, 
know that we have their backs. There 
are also extensions of spending author-
ity for the CARES Act. 
These are just a few of the things 
that we considered over the 3-week pe-
riod, and we came up with a bill that 
spent $748 billion. There were two 
items that were not included in the 
base consensus bill because we couldn’t 
reach a consensus on them. 
State and local government assist-
ance I support completely. I know what 
my cities and my counties and what 
my State have gone through. They 
need help. We couldn’t agree on includ-
ing that in the package at this mo-
ment. I hope this changes even today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7476 
December 15, 2020 
Finally, on the issue of liability and 
immunity from liability, this has been 
one that has been raised by Senator 
MCCONNELL for months. He has basi-
cally said that nothing will move until 
he gets a provision, which I find objec-
tionable, that was originally offered by 
Senator CORNYN. 
Here is what it comes down to: 
Should people be able to go to court if 
they believe that they have been 
harmed or that members of their fam-
ily have died as a result of the wrong-
doing of people during this COVID–19 
pandemic? Some argue that businesses 
should not have that possibility hang-
ing over their heads, and that is what 
Senator CORNYN used as a basis for his 
provision, which makes it almost im-
possible for anyone to recover for any 
losses during COVID–19. Others believe 
that we need to show an even-handed 
approach to this on both sides: If we 
are going to be fair to businesses that 
are legitimately, in good faith, trying 
to protect their employees and cus-
tomers, we should also leave the possi-
bility open that those who are respon-
sible for their actions need to be held 
accountable in court. I think it is a 
simple and basic provision that there 
be equity on both sides, not just for 
plaintiffs but also for defendants. 
We tried mightily during the last 
several weeks, and I want to salute my 
colleagues who engaged directly in 
that effort: ANGUS KING, of Maine; TIM 
KAINE, of Virginia; CHRIS
COONS, of 
Delaware; DICK BLUMENTHAL, of Con-
necticut; 
MAGGIE
HASSAN, 
of 
New 
Hampshire. We offered a variety of op-
tions that we thought were reasonable 
and served the purpose of justice, but 
we couldn’t reach an agreement. 
The others on the Democratic side 
who were part of this overall effort de-
serve mention in the RECORD. I don’t 
want to miss anyone, but I want to in-
clude, certainly, JOE MANCHIN, of West 
Virginia; MARK WARNER, of Virginia; 
and JEANNE SHAHEEN, of New Hamp-
shire. To all of them, I thank them for 
bringing forth this measure. 
Now it is going to be in the hands of 
leadership. I hope we can call it up this 
week. We should not go home without 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, as 
the Republican leader rightly acknowl-
edged a few moments ago, Joe Biden 
will be the next President of the United 
States, and our colleague KAMALA HAR-
RIS will be the next Vice President of 
the United States. Leader MCCONNELL’s 
Republican Senators ought to follow 
suit. They ought to acknowledge that 
Joe Biden will be the next President 
and that KAMALA HARRIS will be the 
next Vice President. 
For the sake of the country, Presi-
dent Trump should take his cue from 
Leader MCCONNELL that it is time to 
end his term with a modicum of grace 
and dignity—qualities that his prede-
cessors took great pains to display dur-
ing our grand tradition of a peaceful 
transfer of power. 
Enough is enough. Our Republican 
colleagues, for the sake of our democ-
racy and for the sake of the peaceful 
transition of power, should stop the 
shenanigans, stop the misrepresenta-
tions, and acknowledge that Joe Biden 
will be our next President. Enough is 
enough. Republican Senators and Re-
publicans 
throughout 
the 
country 
should follow Leader MCCONNELL’s lead 
and acknowledge now that Joe Biden 
will be the next President of the United 
States. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now on COVID–19, 
in a year full of grim milestones, yes-
terday delivered the grimmest yet— 
that more than 300,000 Americans have 
now died from COVID–19. This is great-
er than the number of American sol-
diers who died during the entirety of 
World War II—a population the size of 
St. Louis or Pittsburgh wiped off the 
map—300,000 American souls. 
As trucks bearing the first shipments 
of vaccines fan out across the Nation— 
the first best hope for defeating the 
pandemic in the new year—we cannot 
lose sight of what we have lost this 
year. That is what the end of 2020 has 
brought—hope tinged by grief. It was 
an amazing sight yesterday to see the 
first 
American 
being 
inoculated 
against the disease—a nurse at the 
Long Island Jewish Medical Center in 
Queens, my home State of New York— 
but for so many, the vaccine has not 
come soon enough. 
Let it be our tribute to those Ameri-
cans we lost to do everything in our 
power to limit the losses in moving for-
ward—to produce and distribute as 
many vaccines as are necessary and en-
courage every American—every Amer-
ican—to take the vaccine when it is 
available to him. There are 3 million 
doses of the vaccine that are already 
out the door, and another vaccine is al-
ready in the emergency authorization 
process. Still another vaccine can-
didate may be ready early next year. 
As I said yesterday, the discovery of 
the coronavirus vaccine in the span of 
a calendar year is a crowning scientific 
achievement of the 21st century. Our 
job now is to ensure that the good work 
of America’s scientists, biochemists, 
and medical research is brought to bear 
and that, given the tools, we finally 
stamp out COVID–19 from our country 
and begin the road to recovery. We 
need to fully fund not only the produc-
tion of the vaccine but its distribution 
as well. The States need that money. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, it 
was a hopeful day yesterday as the 
first COVID vaccines in the United 
States were distributed to healthcare 
workers on the frontlines of the COVID 
battle, and later this week, the FDA 
will hold a meeting on an emergency 
use authorization for Moderna’s COVID 
vaccine, meaning that we could have a 
second coronavirus vaccine authorized 
before Christmas. 
If all goes well, we expect to have 100 
million 
Americans 
vaccinated 
by 
March. That is a pretty amazing sta-
tistic when you consider that just a 
year ago, we didn’t even know about 
the virus, and it is a tribute to the in-
novative power of the private sector 
and the efforts of Congress and the 
Trump administration to expedite vac-
cine development. It has been a long, 
hard year, but the light at the end of 
the tunnel is coming. 
But, while yesterday was an encour-
aging day, we have more work to do on 
the COVID front. 
First, we all need to keep following 
the CDC’s recommendations. The roll-
out of Pfizer’s vaccine is wonderful 
news, but cases in the United States 
are still surging. Until we can get a lot 
more people vaccinated, we need to do 
everything we can to slow the spread of 
the virus and avoid overwhelming our 
hospitals. 
Second, we need to pass another 
COVID bill here in Congress to provide 
additional funding for vaccines and de-
liver other urgently needed relief to 
our fellow Americans. Republicans, of 
course, have been trying to pass addi-
tional COVID legislation literally for 
months, and I am encouraged that, in 
the past few weeks, a number of Demo-
crats have stepped forward to work 
with the Republicans to develop bipar-
tisan legislation. Just yesterday, a bi-
partisan group of Senators released 
legislation along the lines of what the 
majority leader has advocated—tar-
geted relief that focuses on our most 
critical needs in the areas where Re-
publicans and Democrats agree. This 
includes important COVID priorities 
like 
vaccine 
funding, 
money 
for 
schools, and help for the hardest hit 
small businesses. 
The 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats’ 
ideal COVID bills might look very dif-
ferent, but there are a number of 
things that all of us agree need to be 
addressed, and we should—in fact, we 
must—pass legislation to take care of 
those priorities. I am thinking about 
vaccine 
distribution 
especially. 
We 
have been blessed with not one but two 
viable vaccines, with more on the hori-
zon. We can’t afford to undermine this 
success by failing to provide the re-
sources that are necessary for wide-
spread distribution. 
The ball is in the Senate Democratic 
leader and Speaker PELOSI’s court. We 
have bipartisan support for targeted re-
lief to address our most critical prior-
ities. In fact, the Democratic leader in 
the House noted on Sunday: 
I think we need to get an agreement, and 
we need to get this bill passed. . . . Nobody

ever gets everything they want. And . . . it’s 
critically important that we deal with these 
very, very important objectives even if we 
don’t get on either side everything we want. 
That was from the Democratic leader 
in the House of Representatives. 
Meanwhile, the Democratic whip on 
the Senate side was part of the bipar-
tisan group who suggested dropping the 
most controversial aspects and focus-
ing on those things on which we agree. 
So the answer really lies with Speak-
er PELOSI and the Democratic leader 
here in the Senate. Are they going to 
heed the bipartisan calls to deliver 
critical coronavirus funding, or are 
they going to continue to block relief 
for Americans? 
Around our country, Americans are 
struggling under the worst wave of the 
virus to date. They need more help. 
Above all, they need the vaccinations 
that will help bring this pandemic to 
an 
end. 
We 
can 
pass 
additional 
coronavirus 
relief 
legislation 
this 
week. To quote the majority leader, 
let’s ‘‘get it done.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM BARR 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, yester-
day evening, President Trump shared 
the news that Attorney General Bill 
Barr will be leaving the administration 
in the coming days, and I want to take 
a moment to publicly thank the Attor-
ney General for his service to our coun-
try. 
Under two different Presidents and at 
two very different times in our coun-
try’s history, Bill Barr gladly answered 
the call to service. His steadfast lead-
ership has enabled the Department of 
Justice to continue its mission at a 
pivotal moment in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
I particularly appreciate Attorney 
General Barr’s attempt to get to the 
bottom of some of the abuse of power 
by the FBI and the Department of Jus-
tice during the latter part of the 
Obama administration and early in the 
Trump administration. 
During his time as Attorney General, 
Bill Barr has consistently fought to 
improve the safety of our communities 
across the country by attacking vio-
lent crime and aggressively countering 
transnational criminal organizations. 
He has been a champion of Project Safe 
Neighborhoods, which has strengthened 
community partnerships and helped to 
reduce crime rates across our country. 
He has taken aim at the threats that 
exist beyond our borders, from drug 
cartels in Mexico to economic exploi-
tation and outright theft by China. 
Through it all, he has been as dogged 
in preventing injustice as in pursuing 
wrongdoing. 
So I want to thank the Attorney 
General once again for not only an-
swering the call to serve a second time 
but also for once again serving with 
distinction and integrity. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
this week is set to be the final week for 
the 116th Congress, and the American 
people are counting on us to do our job. 
We have until this Friday to fund the 
government, and I hope we can pass 
legislation that provides more cer-
tainty than the stopgap bills that have 
become the norm in recent years. 
It is simply impossible for govern-
ment Agencies and Departments like 
the Defense Department to plan with 
short-term 
continuing 
resolutions. 
They need a longer term so they can 
plan and actually spend taxpayer dol-
lars far more efficiently. 
This is also a final opportunity to 
reach 
an 
agreement 
on 
another 
coronavirus bill, something that has 
been on our to-do list since this sum-
mer. 
There is no reason why we shouldn’t 
be able to send a stack of bipartisan 
bills to the President’s desk for his sig-
nature. These may seem like small ball 
compared to some of the big issues like 
keeping the lights on for the govern-
ment or another COVID–19 relief bill, 
but they are very important bipartisan 
pieces of legislation. 
JENNA QUINN LAW 
Mr. President, one of those bills is 
the Jenna Quinn Law, which I have 
spoken on here on the Senate floor 
many times. The goal of this legisla-
tion is straightforward—to stop child 
sexual abuse. It will help us do that by 
building on the success of what is now 
known as Jenna’s Law in Texas and 
other States, which requires training 
for teachers, caregivers, and other 
adults who work with children, who 
will receive specialized training on how 
to detect and report and thus prevent 
child sexual abuse. 
The signs of child sexual abuse are 
unique from other forms of child abuse 
and correctly identifying these signs is 
integral to bringing children out of 
sexually abusive situations. You might 
ask, If there is a Texas State law pro-
viding for this, why do we need a Fed-
eral law? Well, not every State has 
done what Texas has done, but also 
they need the funding to help pay for 
this specialized training. That is what 
the Jenna Quinn Law that is pending in 
Congress will do, and it will encourage 
other States without similar laws to 
implement innovative programs to ad-
dress child sexual abuse. There should 
be few things more unifying than the 
war against child sexual abuse, which 
is why this bill passed the Senate 
unanimously earlier this year. 
But days have turned into weeks and 
weeks have turned into months, and 
the House still hasn’t passed the Jenna 
Quinn Law. It is not because House 
Members oppose the bill. If it came up 
on the floor today, nearly every Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives 
would vote for it. 
This bill hasn’t been able to pass the 
House because one chairman—a Demo-
cratic chairman—won’t even give the 
House a chance to vote on it. For 
months, Education and Labor Com-
mittee Chairman BOBBY SCOTT has re-
fused to move the Jenna Quinn Law. 
Despite repeated requests from count-
less child advocacy groups and a bipar-
tisan group of Senators and Congress-
men, it continues in purgatory on the 
committee calendar. 
Senators HASSAN, SMITH, and I sent a 
letter to Congressman SCOTT
urging 
him to take action and to allow this 
lifesaving legislation to pass the House 
this year. He responded to our letter, 
saying he will continue to hold this 
legislation because he wants to add it 
to other more complicated legislative 
measures next year. 
So when it comes to detecting and 
preventing child sexual abuse, Chair-
man SCOTT thinks we can wait until 
next year. 
We can’t wait until next year. 
In short, he admitted that this legis-
lation is so important and so valuable 
that he can’t let it pass on its own. It 
has to drag other, more controversial, 
more partisan pieces of legislation 
along with it. And just when you think 
things can’t get any worse, they do. 
As I said, this legislation will provide 
funding to the States and will encour-
age States, like Congressman SCOTT’s 
home State of Virginia, to implement 
it. You would think that Congressman 
SCOTT would care. If he didn’t care for 
the bill that would benefit the rest of 
the country, you would think he would 
care about how it would benefit his 
constituents in his home district of 
Virginia. Virginia doesn’t currently re-
quire this training for teachers, care-
givers, and other adults who work with 
children, and this legislation would fix 
that. 
Making this matter even more ur-
gent is the pandemic. Experts believe 
that the unique conditions created by 
COVID–19 have caused instances of 
child sexual abuse to go up, while the 
number of reports has gone down. Fam-
ilies are experiencing a range of new 
stressors, including everything from 
job losses to financial instability, to 
health anxiety, all while isolating at 
home with their children. And the chil-
dren who aren’t going to school each 
day are out of sight from the teachers, 
busdrivers, 
and 
other 
adults 
they 
would otherwise come in contact with 
who are most likely to identify and re-
port child sexual abuse. Adults who 
work with children are the No. 1 re-
porters of that abuse. 
So there could not be a more urgent 
need for this legislation. This is not a 
partisan pet project. It is legislation 
that will save the lives of children 
across the country. Victims in my 
home State of Texas and Congressman 
SCOTT’s home State of Virginia would 
experience the lifesaving benefits of 
the Jenna Quinn Law.

ing News published an editorial titled,

‘‘If Congress can’t even pass a law to 
help save kids from sex abuse, what 
can it get right?’’ 
Well, that is a fair question and a 
tough but necessary question. When 
you see what Chairman SCOTT is doing, 
it is easy to see why Congress’s ap-
proval rating is so abysmal. If a high- 
ranking leader of a House committee 
will block commonsense legislation 
that is directed at stopping child sex-
ual abuse, how can the American peo-
ple have faith in Congress’s ability to 
accomplish anything? 
Now is not the time to play politics 
or use child sexual abuse victims as le-
verage. This bill is one step away from 
going to the President’s desk, and Con-
gressman SCOTT is the only one stand-
ing in the way. 
It is time to quit playing games and 
allow the Jenna Quinn Law to pass. 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Mr. President, now on one final mat-
ter, we are less than 1 month away 
from the biannual changing of the 
guard in Congress before we gavel out 
for the year. I want to say just a few 
comments about our friend from Colo-
rado who will soon be leaving the Sen-
ate, Senator CORY GARDNER. 
Senator GARDNER has proudly rep-
resented the people of Colorado for 15 
years, first in the State House, then in 
the House of Representatives, and now 
in the U.S. Senate. 
Once you get to know CORY, it is easy 
to see how this ‘‘boy from Yuma’’ be-
came such a trusted voice for his home 
State. 
For starters, he is a prime example of 
what Ronald Reagan called a ‘‘happy 
warrior.’’ At the end of his speech in 
1985, President Reagan spoke about the 
pursuit of high ideals like liberty, free-
dom, and fairness, and the reasons our 
country has to be hopeful and opti-
mistic. He said: ‘‘So, let us go forth 
with good cheer and stout hearts— 
happy warriors out to seize back a 
country and a world to freedom.’’ 
Those qualities of ‘‘good cheer and 
stout hearts’’ could not be a more ap-
propriate description of our friend from 
Colorado. Senator GARDNER has main-
tained a very keen understanding of 
the challenges we have faced as a na-
tion, and he channels his passion and 
his optimism in finding solutions to 
those challenges. 
There is no question that he does get 
results. In the 6 years he has been in 
the Senate, CORY
has accomplished 
more than some Senators have accom-
plished in double or maybe even triple 
that time. He has been a strong voice 
on the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and has helped lead changes to 
counter some of the most pressing 
threats facing our country. 
He helped pass the first-ever sanc-
tions on North Korea to denuclearize 
one of the most untethered states and 
nations in the world. He fought to hold 
China 
accountable 
for 
their 
gross 
human rights violations, specifically 
those targeting the Uighur people. He 
has led efforts to strengthen the rela-
tionship between the United States and 
Taiwan. 
But I think the accomplishments he 
is most proud of are those that hit 
much closer to home. Cory introduced 
legislation to designate 9–8-8 as a na-
tional suicide prevention and mental 
health hotline. It is impossible to know 
how many lives have been and will be 
saved by simply adopting this three- 
digit phone number. 
This last year, he led in the passage 
of the Great American Outdoors Act, 
the largest conservation bill in a gen-
eration. 
A big factor in CORY’s success has 
been his relationships with his fellow 
Senators—not those backroom trans-
actional relationships you think of, 
perhaps, when you think about poli-
tics, but I mean real friendships with 
folks throughout the Capitol Complex. 
If there were a Mr. or Ms. Congeniality 
contest in Congress, CORY would win by 
a landslide. 
It is common to see him talking not 
only with Senators from both parties 
but staffers in other offices. He was 
once 
a 
staffer 
in 
Senator 
Wayne 
Allard’s office. So he can identify with 
them, as well as the Capitol Police, and 
the countless men and women who 
keep Congress running, from cafeteria 
workers to cleaning staff. 
He greets every person with the same 
genuine smile and is glad to spend a 
few minutes chatting, asking about 
your family, holiday plans, or how 
someone’s day is going. That sin-
cerity—his willingness to listen and 
deal with people on such a human and 
personal level—is something we need 
more of, not less of, here in Wash-
ington, especially these days. 
So the Senate will miss our happy 
warrior and the trademark positivity 
he brings to even the most contentious 
debates. And while we are sad to see 
him go, I know this isn’t the last we 
will hear of or see of CORY GARDNER. 
The only thing more enduring than his 
energy is his drive to help people from 
all places and in all walks of life. 
So, while our colleagues are sad to 
bid farewell to our friend CORY, we 
know that Jaime, Alyson, Caitlyn, and 
Thatcher are all eager to have him 
back home in Yuma and see more of 
him and spend more time together. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, millions 
and millions of people will breathe a 
bit easier on January 20. That relief 
will be especially sweet for those who 
suffered under Donald Trump’s cold-
hearted approach to immigration and 
asylum. 
The President has built a wall to im-
migrants, but it is not made of fencing 
or brick and mortar. The President has 
rebuilt the infamous paper wall, like 
that of the 1930s, which kept too many 
Jews out of the United States, trapping 
them within the murderous regime of 
Nazi Germany. 
The paper wall was built on anti-mi-
grant regulations, including one tar-
geting anybody who might become a 
so-called public charge. It was rein-
forced by racism, anti-Semitism, and 
nativism. It created bureaucratic road-
blocks that had no purpose other than 
to frustrate applicants, block visas and 
refugees, and slow immigration to a 
trickle. That is awfully familiar to 
those who watched Donald Trump suc-
ceed horribly at repeating some of 
America’s 
worst 
immigration 
mis-
takes. 
In the last 4 years, I have often 
thought about my late mom and dad 
who were refugees to America. My par-
ents were German Jews who fled the 
Nazis. 
Not all of our family got out. My 
great-uncle, Max, was one of the last to 
be gassed at Auschwitz. 
When my father arrived here at 13, he 
barely spoke any English. He studied 
hard. When the war came, my dad, who 
wasn’t 
exactly 
built 
like 
Captain 
America, wanted more than anything 
to wear the uniform of the U.S. Army. 
My dad essentially talked his way into 
the service. He joined the Army’s psy-
chological warfare division because, 
with his fluent German, my dad wrote 
propaganda pamphlets that our planes 
dropped on the enemy soldiers that 
were retreating further and further 
back toward Berlin. 
I have seen those pamphlets, and— 
with a little son pride—they were 
smoking. They just told the Nazis they 
didn’t have a chance. In contrast, the 
materials their military dropped on 
our soldiers was written in mangled 
English—comical stuff. My dad has 
really been singled out. He is in the 
Holocaust Museum for his contribu-
tions for helping our Army beat the 
Nazis, and after the war, he became a 
journalist and an author. 
My mom came in 1939, a few years 
after my dad. During the war, she 
served in the Women’s Army Corps. 
She was in England, France, and Ger-
many, and on the wall at home is a pic-
ture of my mom in her WAC uniform. 
You can look at that picture, and you 
can see pride in serving our country 
from every single pore. 
After the war, my mom had a long 
career as a research librarian, and she 
worked even harder raising her oldest 
son, who mostly wanted to play NBA 
basketball instead of hitting the books. 
Both my parents felt so blessed that 
they could get out of Germany. They 
made it over the paper wall. They had 
a chance to become Americans. 
Most Jewish families in the United 
States have stories just like these. 
Some were able to get out; others were 
left behind, and some were lost.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7479 
December 15, 2020 
Many remember the MS St. Louis, a 
ship with nearly 1,000 refugees—mostly 
Jewish—fleeing Germany in 1930. Origi-
nally, they sailed for Cuba, but they 
were turned away when they reached 
Havana. Then they tried to come to 
America. They got so close. They could 
see the lights shining in Miami, but 
again they were turned away and sailed 
back to Europe. Hundreds of them died 
in death camps. Many more lives like 
those aboard the St. Louis could and 
should have been saved, but the paper 
wall—that paper wall—kept too many 
people out. 
In 2020, caring people looked back 
and recognized that paper wall and our 
failure to save more people from execu-
tion at the hands of the Nazis. It was a 
staggering humanitarian disaster, a 
real stain on American history. 
Donald Trump and his advisers, on 
the other hand, must look back and see 
the paper wall as a big success, a play-
book for their administration. Under 
Donald Trump, the policy of the United 
States on immigration, asylum, and 
refugees—sum it up in one word: cru-
elty. Trump’s worst legacy on asylum 
and refugee policy, without a doubt, is 
the kidnapping and abuse of young-
sters—children—locking them in cages, 
losing track of them, and losing track 
of their parents. It is the forced steri-
lization of women in the custody of the 
U.S. Government. It is violating U.S. 
law and international treaties to turn 
asylum seekers into criminals. 
I went to the border to see for myself 
what Trump’s family separation poli-
cies looked like in practice. When you 
see it, you never forget. 
I met a migrant woman who was al-
most 9 months pregnant and suffering 
complications. A pediatrician from Or-
egon who came with me was concerned 
that this woman’s life was in danger, 
as well as her unborn child. She had 
been stopped at the border, along with 
her husband and their 3-year-old son, 
even though she had a legal right—a 
legal right—to make an asylum claim. 
Our pediatrician, who worried that 
the woman was going to go into labor 
right there, had to make a judgment 
call about what we ought to do. So, for-
tunately, we got her case before the 
right border authorities. She was able 
to make her asylum claim, get medical 
care, and keep her family together. 
At the time, I saw a little boy who 
had been detained for several nights in 
a cold, cramped cell—they call them 
iceboxes—and then sent back to Mex-
ico. This youngster was so traumatized 
at the border that he became entirely 
nonverbal and afraid of adults. His fa-
ther held my hand and cried, and he 
told us how helpless he felt as a parent. 
I will never forget that experience. 
Children and parents on the southern 
border are experiencing the worst of 
Donald 
Trump’s 
hostility, 
but 
it 
doesn’t end there. His administration 
has relentlessly attacked and squeezed 
the traditional systems of immigration 
and humanitarian assistance and ref-
ugee resettlement as well. A lot has 
gone into this paper wall. Anti-immi-
gration policies have bookended the 
Trump 4 years. One of their first new 
policies out of the gate was the Muslim 
ban, which was a nightmare for many 
immigrants and immigrant families. 
Now, in Donald Trump’s final days, 
his administration has made the citi-
zenship exam twice as hard and twice 
as long. Reportedly, questions were re-
written with Trump-friendly political 
bias and tricky language designed to 
trip people up. There wasn’t any dis-
cussion about any exams here in Con-
gress. When you read the old version of 
the test that existed before the Trump 
meddling, it was pretty darn chal-
lenging. There is no good-faith expla-
nation for the changes. It was only 
about making it harder—making it 
harder to become an American. 
Through his years in office, Donald 
Trump steadily lowered the cap on ref-
ugees allowed in the country. For 2021, 
he set it at the lowest number ever. 
Then there is the DACA Program, 
Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival. 
We talked here in the Senate about the 
Dreamers, and when the program was 
created, there was a promise made that 
it would be OK for the Dreamers to 
come out of the shadows. You could 
apply without fear and have your appli-
cation renewed in 2 years. I think the 
government has a moral obligation to 
keep the promise. Not on Donald 
Trump’s watch—if not for court orders, 
DACA would be dismantled by now. 
There are more than 11,000 hard- 
working young people in my home 
State that are DACA recipients. I have 
talked with a lot of them. They come 
to my townhall meetings. We meet on 
campus and meet in coffee shops. 
Not long after the pandemic hit, one 
young Oregon DACA recipient started 
working with COVID patients. She just 
wanted to help during the pandemic— 
coordinating tests, working on fol-
lowup, contact tracing. What a wonder-
ful person doing essential work during 
the 
pandemic, 
but 
her 
temporary 
DACA status ran out just when the 
Trump administration blocked renew-
als. Fortunately, my staff and I were 
able to help her reapply and retain her 
status so she could keep working in the 
only place she ever called home. 
The harsh reality is there are thou-
sands and thousands of young Dream-
ers who have been faced with the same 
panic of losing their status, being 
ripped from their homes and deported. 
The fact is, Donald Trump has used 
these Dreamers like pawns. 
Recently, he dusted off the public 
charge rule, using the past to discrimi-
nate against Jewish refugees. I con-
sider it a wealth test for immigrants— 
a cruel system that pushes vulnerable 
immigrant families into destitution. 
In Oregon, right now, it means that 
there are families who are just afraid 
to seek assistance they are entitled to 
receive, afraid to seek emergency med-
ical assistance during a pandemic, and 
afraid to seek disaster relief after huge 
wildfires. These families—we talk to 
them—they 
desperately 
need 
help. 
They are members of Oregon’s collec-
tive community, but they can’t get it 
because they are fearful they will be la-
beled a ‘‘public charge.’’ 
Donald Trump revoked protected im-
migration status from hundreds of 
thousands of U.S. residents originally 
from countries ravaged by war, fam-
ines, and epidemics. Many of those peo-
ple who have lived here for decades had 
planted deep roots. Nothing is accom-
plished by revoking their status and 
deporting them, other than shattering 
their lives and weakening their com-
munities. 
Then, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
adopted a ‘‘no blanks’’ policy so they 
could reject applications for visa and 
asylum if there were just simple paper-
work errors. For example, let’s say an 
only child filling out a visa application 
leaves a blank where it asks for details 
on siblings—they could be rejected. 
Even simple errors that mean noth-
ing—writing in a dash instead of an ‘‘N/ 
A’’ for an inapplicable question—leads 
to rejection. The policy, here again, 
has resulted in huge cuts to immigra-
tion and asylum. 
During the pandemic, the Trump ad-
ministration denied COVID relief to 
tax-paying, law-abiding American im-
migrants who secure America’s food 
supply 
or 
save 
lives 
as 
frontline 
healthcare workers. 
Next, there is a sabotage of the sys-
tem of printing documents for immi-
grants, including green cards that 
allow residents to work and go to 
school. This affected tens of thousands, 
again, who did nothing wrong. Some of 
them were newly approved applicants, 
many others were longtime U.S. resi-
dents replacing green cards that were 
expired or lost. If an immigrant’s green 
card expires, and they don’t have the 
replacement, they are out of luck and 
technically in a kind of legal never- 
never land. It is all because Donald 
Trump wanted to break the system 
just to cause harm. 
Now let’s talk about those who work 
alongside our military overseas. You 
would think that if there were any 
group—any group—whose immigration 
status got a special level of care from 
our government, it would be those 
whose lives are in danger in their home 
country because they served coura-
geously alongside our forces. That has 
not been the case under Donald Trump. 
For example, there have been reports 
on an Afghan pilot on the run from the 
Taliban because his clearance to relo-
cate in the United States was reversed. 
The U.S. Army pilot who trained him 
said: 
He’s marked as a dead man. He’s done all 
he can there. . . . If anyone needs to be a 
U.S. citizen, it’s him. 
But 
the 
Trump 
administration, 
which initially approved his relocation, 
went back on its word. This pilot is 
now reportedly in hiding with his wife 
and their 4-year-old daughter. They are 
among tens of thousands of Afghans 
and Iraqis whose lives are in danger

waiting for the U.S. Government to de-
cide on their immigration status. 
The number of these courageous indi-
viduals brought to the United States 
has plummeted under Donald Trump, 
again, because of this anti-immigrant 
bias. 
I remember the late-Senator John 
McCain speaking often about why our 
country needed to protect those who 
helped our men and women in battle. 
John McCain said it wasn’t just a 
moral issue but also a national secu-
rity issue. He said: Won’t it be harder 
to get people to help our soldiers in the 
future if America abandons those who 
have helped us in the past? For Donald 
Trump, it seems hostility toward im-
migrants overrides even America’s na-
tional security. 
Donald Trump has often claimed he 
supports immigration. He once hi-
jacked 
a 
naturalization 
ceremony, 
which is supposed to be a solemn event, 
no politics. He stole that moment from 
the group of people becoming citizens 
so he could go on and on about false 
claims about his position on immigra-
tion. He said he wanted ‘‘tremendous 
numbers of people to go in.’’ 
Over the last, I guess, 8 or so min-
utes, I have proved that sure is not 
true. The reality is, Donald Trump cut 
legal immigration in half. If I were to 
walk through every cruel and inhu-
mane thing this administration has 
done to immigrants, asylum seekers, 
and refugees, we would be standing 
here until the beginning of January. 
It is going to be hard work disman-
tling Donald Trump’s paper wall, but it 
is a must-do for the President and Vice 
President-elect. I know they agree. 
I want to close my remarks by talk-
ing a little bit about why immigration 
matters. As an Oregonian, I can tell 
that you that Oregon is clearly strong-
er today because of our openness to im-
migrants and refugees and asylum 
seekers. We call it, at home—people 
hear me talk about it here—the Oregon 
Way. It is about fundamental decency. 
There is no other way to describe the 
Oregon Way than those two words, 
‘‘fundamental decency.’’ 
Here is an example of how the Oregon 
Way collides with the Trump policies 
pertaining to visas. Twelve years ago, 
an Iraqi boy named Mustafa came to 
Oregon to receive badly needed medical 
care. He was very injured. He lost a leg 
during the U.S. bomb strike. He needed 
complicated surgeries that couldn’t get 
done in Iraq, so a group of Oregonians 
worked with a nonprofit to bring him 
to my hometown of Portland. 
Mustafa got good care and was able 
to go home. The plan was for him to 
come back to Oregon, periodically, for 
ongoing treatment. Back home in Iraq, 
however, communication was difficult, 
and his family was displaced by Islamic 
State militants. 
Miraculously, in 2016, Oregonians rec-
ognized Mustafa on the TV news from a 
refugee camp outside Fallujah. It was 
clear he still dealt with serious health 
problems. Again, Oregon citizens and 
nonprofits went to bat for him. Again, 
they worked to bring him to the United 
States for care, except this time—this 
time, the Trump administration closed 
the door to Iraqis. They were out of 
luck. 
My staff and I got involved, and to-
gether with all of these dedicated Or-
egonians, we were able to work with 
the Embassy and get key officials to 
get a temporary visa for Mustafa and 
his mom. He got the lifesaving care he 
needed. The Oregon Way actually beat 
back Trump’s hostility to immigra-
tion. 
Now, supporting immigration is not 
just the decent thing to do, it is also 
the smart thing to do for our economy. 
My State is a perfect example. From 
the high-tech economy in the ‘‘Silicon 
Forest’’ to our wonderful family farms 
all across the State, immigrants con-
tribute every day to our economy. 
Nationwide, on average, communities 
with more immigrants have stronger 
and more dynamic economies. Immi-
grants are more likely than those born 
in the United States to participate in 
the labor force. Immigrants are more 
likely to own a small business. Immi-
grants are more likely to move for em-
ployment and take jobs that otherwise 
go unfilled. Those immigrants, plug 
gaps in our economy. They plug gaps in 
our job market. Immigrants are more 
likely to be entrepreneurs. Their kids 
are more likely to want to just work 
and work and work, and they have 
shown that they are more likely to 
climb the economic ladder. 
Immigration has also proven to be a 
big economic and population boost for 
our rural communities, which too 
often, in too many parts of the coun-
try, somehow look like people just are 
willing to turn them into economic 
sacrifice zones, compared to the focus 
on the cities and suburbs. 
Our colleges and universities des-
perately need more foreign-born stu-
dents. Most foreign-born students pay 
full sticker price and subsidize the stu-
dents born in the United States. Due to 
COVID and anti-migrant policies, fewer 
and fewer international students come 
to study in American schools. They are 
choosing to study in other countries 
instead. And you can bet those other 
countries are happy to welcome the 
bright minds at our expense and let 
them find a way to help their econo-
mies. 
Our schools struggle to keep the 
doors open under these conditions. 
They have managed to block some 
Trump policies that are particularly 
harmful to students. I am very proud 
that my alma mater, the University of 
Oregon, led one of those lawsuits. 
But still, many schools are likely to 
close. And if there are fewer inter-
national students coming here who are 
subsidizing Americans, the price that 
American-born students pay for a col-
lege education goes up. It is legislative 
malpractice for the lawmakers to allow 
that to happen when it is a crisis you 
know is headed this way. It is, obvi-
ously, in our interest to be a magnet 
for the best and the brightest. 
Immigrants also protect vital safety 
net programs that Americans care so 
deeply about. With 10,000 people reach-
ing retirement age every day, our 
country needs more workers, more peo-
ple paying into Social Security, more 
people paying into Medicare, 
wel-
coming into the country more work-
ing-age people who can help shore up 
those trust funds. It can help to protect 
the Medicare guarantee and help en-
sure that Social Security pays full ben-
efits. It is a big mistake to pass up that 
opportunity. 
Finally, the economic boost isn’t the 
biggest reason to support immigration. 
The biggest reason is immigration is 
about our national character; it is 
about our common history. Our coun-
try was founded by people with courage 
and audacity, people who picked up 
their lives and crossed oceans to start 
something new. Who are we to turn 
away all those who would follow in 
their footsteps? Welcoming immigrants 
from around the world makes us more 
youthful and resilient. It honors our 
founding. 
America has always been a land of 
opportunity. It is why my parents 
loved the United States so deeply after 
they arrived here as frightened young-
sters fleeing the worst of humanity. 
Decades later, because of the oppor-
tunity this country handed my parents, 
their son—a first-generation Jewish 
kid—has the honor of standing on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate, the honor of 
representing Oregon in the U.S. Sen-
ate. And what an honor it is to be able 
to be here this morning to talk about 
why the Wyden family is so grateful to 
the United States of America. If some-
day people around the world no longer 
see the United States as a land of op-
portunity, we will have strayed from 
America’s character and purpose. 
For now, the good news is that Don-
ald Trump’s Presidency ends next 
month. The attacks on our immigra-
tion system and on people who dream 
of becoming Americans will be nothing 
more than the angry tweets from a 
man voted out of office. 
With the end of the Trump era, the 
United States can tear down the 
Trump paper wall and rebuild the coa-
lition of Americans from all across the 
political spectrum who value the con-
tributions of immigrants and who care 
for asylum seekers and refugees. It is 
an important part of what makes 
America so special. 
I yield the floor, and I believe we 
have another speaker. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
HONORING TYLER HERNDON 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I am here 
today to honor the life of Officer Tyler 
Herndon, a member of the Mount Holly 
Police Department in North Carolina, 
not far from where I live. He tragically 
lost his life in the line of duty last 
week, just days before his 26th birth-
day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7481 
December 15, 2020 
Officer Herndon will be laid to rest 
today, and I want to take a moment to 
honor his life, his service to his com-
munity, and speak about the noble pro-
fession he chose. 
Officer Herndon was responding to a 
report of a break-in on Friday morn-
ing, and upon his arrival, he was mur-
dered on the scene. He had been a po-
lice officer at Mount Holly for less 
than 2 years. He is described by his col-
leagues on the Mount Holly Police De-
partment as ‘‘the guy you just couldn’t 
help but like.’’ He was active in his 
community, not only as a law enforce-
ment officer but as a volunteer in local 
schools. His goal was to become an FBI 
officer, and he was just approaching 
the 2 years he needed as a police officer 
to become eligible to apply for the FBI. 
Officer Herndon’s life and promising 
career were senselessly taken away. 
His tragic death is a reminder of the 
dangers our men and women in blue 
face every single day that they go to 
work to protect our communities. 
In 2020, this year, we have lost 47 po-
lice officers who have been killed in 
the line of duty across the United 
States. Of those, 8 were ambushed in 
premeditated attacks, 2 were victims 
of an unprovoked attack, and 37 offi-
cers were killed in the line of duty. 
These gruesome killings are in addi-
tion to the hundreds of officers who 
have been shot and injured this year. 
These 47 Americans are not only law 
enforcement officers—they are some-
body’s parent; they are someone’s 
spouse; they are someone’s child. That 
is a point that has unfortunately been 
neglected by some, especially given the 
shameful effort to not only minimize 
the work of law enforcement but to 
also demonize it. 
Law enforcement officers put their 
lives on the line to keep us safe every 
single day. Our debates in Congress 
should not be about whether to defund 
or abolish the police; they should be 
about how we can respect and support 
law enforcement through greater in-
vestments and commonsense reforms. 
I will never turn my back on the 
brave men and women of law enforce-
ment who protect North Carolina and 
protect communities across this great 
Nation. 
Congress needs to start showing more 
support and respect for law enforce-
ment, not only through our words but 
through our actions, and we must hold 
violent criminals who target them ac-
countable. That is why I and several 
other Senate colleagues have intro-
duced the Protect and Serve Act. It is 
legislation that would create Federal 
penalties for individuals who delib-
erately target local, State, and Federal 
law enforcement officers with violence. 
Next Congress, I plan to reintroduce 
this legislation and work to build sup-
port until its passage because, with in-
creased penalties like those proposed 
in the Protect and Serve Act, criminals 
may start thinking twice before tar-
geting an officer, and if they choose to 
do it, they are going to regret it. 
There is no doubt that being a law 
enforcement officer is one of the hard-
est and most dangerous jobs in this 
country, but it is also one of the most 
noble and honorable professions. They 
run to danger to protect others. They 
are fully aware of those dangers as 
they go through the police academy 
and begin their career as officers. Yet 
they do it every single day. 
Tyler Herndon is an officer who an-
swered the call, ran into danger to pro-
tect others, and lost his life. My 
thoughts and prayers are with Officer 
Herndon’s family, the Mount Holly Po-
lice Department, and the community 
he served. I want Tyler Herndon’s fam-
ily and law enforcement across the 
State of North Carolina to know that 
we will never forget the sacrifice he 
made and they make every day and 
that we are going to work hard to get 
them the respect and the resources 
they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise to honor and pay tribute to our 
Senate colleagues who are departing at 
the end of this Congress. I was able to 
work with all of them in different 
ways, and we are going to miss them. 
Before that, I did want to mention 
the importance of the continuing nego-
tiations on end-of-the-year pandemic 
relief. I have been involved in those, 
and I want to thank those Members 
who have been at the forefront of this 
all through the weekend, all through 
the last few weeks. 
I cannot stress how important it is 
right now. My State just got through a 
spike in COVID. We lost so many peo-
ple. We have so many small businesses, 
like so many States in this country, 
that are closed down. 
While we see the light at the end of 
the tunnel with the vaccine, I talked to 
a friend of mine whose husband is an 
infectious disease doctor, and she said 
when she saw those trucks rolling out 
in Michigan, she just started to sob 
just seeing it on TV. I think that is 
how a lot of people in this country feel, 
but it is on us right now to make sure 
we get the funding so that vaccine gets 
distributed as it should and to also en-
sure that our economy is in a place 
that when we start going back into the 
workplace—not just virtually—we will 
be able to bounce back as we should, 
and that means pandemic relief at the 
end of this year. 
TRIBUTE TO DOUG JONES 
Mr. President, so my departing col-
leagues—and I like every single one of 
them. I will start with my good friend 
Senator DOUG JONES. 
Throughout the years, I have gotten 
to know DOUG, as so many of us have, 
as a colleague but more importantly, 
as a friend. These past few years have 
not been easy for anyone, but what 
they have called for are leaders who 
will do what is right and who are will-
ing to show courage and take risks. 
One of those leaders is DOUG JONES, a 
native of Fairfield, AL, and the son of 
a father who worked in the steel indus-
try. My grandpa worked in the iron ore 
business underground. I know a little 
bit about this. 
DOUG graduated from the University 
of Alabama and the University of Ala-
bama 
Law 
School. 
Afterwards, 
he 
served as a top aide for his home State 
Senator Howell Heflin. I still remem-
ber Howell Heflin. Long after Walter 
Mondale had left government, I was 
working with him in Minnesota, and 
Howell Heflin would call for him, and 
the accent was a little hard for a Min-
nesotan to get through. I remember 
Mondale, literally within a few hours, 
howling with laughter when he took 
the call. I am sure he was a great men-
tor for DOUG to have when he first got 
into politics. 
DOUG then became the U.S. attorney 
for the Northern District of Alabama, 
and in 2017 he became the first Demo-
crat to represent Alabama in the U.S. 
Senate since 1997. 
I will never forget the first speech 
DOUG gave on the Senate floor. It was 
about gun violence, calling for biparti-
sanship and pragmatism and for the 
courage to seize the moment. He actu-
ally quoted Senator Heflin, saying: 
Our 
Constitution 
itself 
came 
about 
through a series of great compromises; it 
was not written by ideologues who clung to 
their way or no way. Compromise and nego-
tiation—the 
hallmarks 
of 
moderation— 
aimed at achieving moderate, centrist poli-
cies for our country should not be viewed as 
negatives. 
DOUG believed in a simple philosophy 
when he was here: Never compromise 
your 
principles—and 
he 
certainly 
showed us that—but work with your 
colleagues, Democrat or Republican, to 
move our country forward. 
I remember what he said about gun 
safety in his maiden speech. He was 
hopeful that we may have reached a 
tipping point because ‘‘our young men 
and women are awakening the con-
science of America.’’ 
That is something that DOUG
has 
done in his time in the U.S. Senate, 
and he showed it even before that 
when, as a prosecutor, he brought clo-
sure to the families of the four little 
girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist 
Church bombing by prosecuting those 
who sought to use fear, hatred, and vio-
lence to inhibit the rights of others. He 
did that for his State because that was 
his job, but in so doing, he brought clo-
sure and justice for our Nation. 
We are all fortunate to call DOUG a 
friend. He has been a champion for vet-
erans. After the tax bill had a problem 
with survivor benefits for Gold Star 
families, it was DOUG who introduced 
the bill to fix the problem and got it 
passed for those who had already made 
the ultimate sacrifice. 
It has truly been an honor and a 
privilege to work alongside Senator 
JONES. Integrity and decency—those 
are the words I think about when I 
think about DOUG JONES, and he will be 
missed in this Senate.

December 15, 2020 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Mr. President, Senator UDALL of New 
Mexico has been an incredible steward 
and champion of so many of the things 
at the heart of our country’s greatness, 
like America’s great outdoors and nat-
ural lands, a culture enriched by our 
Tribal nations, and an enduring com-
mitment to democracy. America’s en-
vironment, our Native communities, 
and our right to vote are some of the 
fundamental elements that make this 
country so unique, and Senator UDALL 
has faithfully served the people of New 
Mexico and all Americans as an incred-
ibly gifted national leader on these 
issues and so many more. 
I got to serve with Senator UDALL on 
the Commerce Committee, where dur-
ing the pandemic we worked together 
to bridge the digital divide and expand 
broadband, especially for our Tribal 
communities, where, as we all know, he 
served as the ranking member, the top 
Democrat, on the Indian Affairs Com-
mittee. 
I also was proud to serve with Sen-
ator UDALL in the Rules Committee. 
We worked on Native American voting 
rights together, but he was the lead. He 
was the lead on so many bills that 
would make our democracy better. I 
hope that one of his legacies is that, 
when he is gone, we will be able to fi-
nally put these laws into operation and 
get them done. 
One of his great pieces of legislation 
was a constitutional amendment to 
overturn Citizens United, and one day 
we will get this done. So many people 
are tired of the money streaming into 
our politics, the fact that we have hid-
den money streaming into our politics, 
and his amendment would fix so much 
of this. 
He was also cofounder of the Congres-
sional International Conservation Cau-
cus, where he left his mark on this 
country with his work to protect pub-
lic lands and national parks while pro-
moting America’s leadership in con-
servation. 
From his years as New Mexico’s at-
torney general to his 10 years of service 
in the House of Representatives and his 
12 years as a U.S. Senator, TOM UDALL 
has been literally a giant in public 
service. No one should be surprised. He 
once summed up what drove him by 
saying: ‘‘The thing that inspired me 
the most when I was very young was 
the idea that if you had a good idea of 
reforming something and you really 
stuck to it, you could literally change 
the world.’’ 
Well, I am going to miss Senator 
UDALL, and we are also going to miss 
his wife Jill, whom I got to know well. 
I have a fond memory of one of the new 
Senator orientations where Tom and 
Jill and my husband John and I were 
tasked with talking to the arriving 
Senators a few years ago, brand-new, in 
this building and giving them tips on 
how they operate and how they handle 
their first few years and how you can 
stay married while being a U.S. Sen-
ator. I remember it fondly because 
MITT ROMNEY was sitting in the front 
row taking notes diligently, and I 
thought maybe he didn’t need our ad-
vice on this. 
But Tom and Jill are just an incred-
ible couple in a town where it is not al-
ways easy to keep such a strong, beau-
tiful relationship. 
So I want to thank Senator UDALL 
for his work on behalf of his State, the 
beautiful State of New Mexico, and 
thank the State for sharing their ex-
traordinary Senator with the Nation 
for so many years. 
Senator UDALL, thank you for your 
service, and I know there is more to 
come. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Mr. President, my colleagues, Sen-
ator PAT ROBERTS, as we know, is the 
longest serving member of Congress in 
Kansas history. He leaves the Senate 
as a giant in his home State and a true 
champion for the people of Kansas. 
In his words, he is a Kansan ‘‘through 
and through,’’ born in Topeka, earning 
his journalism degree from Kansas 
State, and representing Kansas for 16 
years in the House and 22 years in the 
Senate. 
I serve on the Agriculture Com-
mittee, and he has been my chairman. 
I have been proud to serve with him as 
a fellow farm-State Senator, where he 
has been a champion for the bread-
basket of America, as Kansas is known. 
He has also worked tirelessly to 
honor those legendary Kansans who 
came before him. Earlier this year, 
Senator ROBERTS was there to cut the 
ribbon at the dedication of the Eisen-
hower Memorial, a monument he has 
been devoted to as chairman of the Ei-
senhower Memorial Commission, and I 
know he is one of the few members of 
Congress who can actually say he met 
President Eisenhower. At the dedica-
tion, Senator ROBERTS remarked that 
‘‘Eisenhower understood one person’s 
ability to chart his or her own course 
and change the course of the world.’’ 
That is something Senator ROBERTS 
has done often, in a quiet manner. 
I have really admired the way he 
worked across the aisle with Senator 
STABENOW every day. They didn’t al-
ways agree on everything, but they 
found common ground. I got to work 
with him on a number of issues—ensur-
ing that our wheat growers would get 
sorely 
needed 
relief 
through 
the 
CARES program, making the Tax Code 
consistent with how farmers finance 
new equipment, and protecting our 
food supply chain through investments 
in science and research. 
When I think about the legacy Chair-
man ROBERTS will leave, I think about 
those investments in science and re-
search through the creation of the 
Foundation for Food and Agriculture 
Research and the National Bio and 
Agro-Defense Facility. 
Both of these facilities will play a 
critical role in helping today’s farmers 
and ranchers tackle the many chal-
lenges that they face. He has also been 
cochair of the Senate Rural Health 
Caucus, working to ensure quality 
healthcare—not just in urban areas 
where it is so important but also in 
rural areas. 
We both come from families of news-
papermen. Senator ROBERTS’ great- 
grandfather, J.W. Roberts, founded the 
Oskaloosa Independent, the second old-
est newspaper in Kansas. And my dad 
started at a Minneapolis paper as a 
sports reporter, where his main beat 
was the Minnesota Vikings. Maybe the 
things that we have in common stop 
there, but, certainly, that newspaper 
background is something we have 
talked about and shared. 
I will miss Senator ROBERTS’ humor, 
and I will miss his good work and look 
forward to continuing to work with 
Senator STABENOW and Senator BOOZ-
MAN as leaders of the Agriculture Com-
mittee. 
TRIBUTE TO LAMAR ALEXANDER 
Mr. President, next, Senator ALEX-
ANDER. Senator ALEXANDER has served 
the people of Tennessee for more com-
bined years as Senator and Governor 
than anyone else from their State. 
With both Senator ROBERTS and Sen-
ator ALEXANDER, we literally will be 
missing people who bring to this place 
the strong sense of commitment and 
long service to our government. 
Senator ALEXANDER has served our 
country as he worked to find consensus 
on the issues that matter most—like 
education, healthcare, mental health 
and addiction. I saw him work day by 
day with Senator PATTY MURRAY, and 
they were able to pass so many bills to 
show this Chamber that, in fact, you 
can get little things done—yes—but 
you can also get big things done, in-
cluding the changes that they made 
that were long needed to No Child Left 
Behind, including the changes in the 
work that they have done when it 
comes to healthcare. 
As he gave advice to his successor, 
incoming Senator Bill Hagerty, LAMAR 
said, ‘‘It’s hard to get here, in the 
United States Senate. It’s hard to stay 
here. And while you’re here you might 
as well try to accomplish something 
good for the country.’’ 
Like his many quips—and I have read 
his book, his red plaid book of advice— 
and the many things he has shared 
with me for advice, including running 
for President, which may not have 
worked for either of us, but you could 
tell the love that he brought to the 
people of this country and the people of 
his State and how he talked about 
them and how he approached his work. 
As a former Secretary of Education 
under President George H.W. Bush, 
president of the University of Ten-
nessee, and as chairman of the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, Senator ALEXANDER, we know, 
has worked tirelessly to ensure every 
child can succeed. 
In addition to the work I just men-
tioned that he did with the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act and the work he did 
on the Carl D. Perkins Career and 
Technical Education Act, he has also

led legislation to help people in their 
youngest years as well as their senior 
years. I appreciated especially the 
work that he did on Alzheimer’s and 
making sure that we continue to invest 
in our science and education. 
One little fact you may not know in 
all the tributes that have come out 
about Senator ALEXANDER—and I was 
here for his speech—is that every sum-
mer for 25 years, he and his wife and 
four children have gone to the Bound-
ary Waters to canoe and fish. The 
Boundary Waters in Northern Min-
nesota is very close to where my dad 
grew up. In fact, it is the town that is 
the gateway to the Boundary Waters in 
Ely, MN, something that—way back 
when Senator ALEXANDER was going 
there for the first few years—my dad 
was writing about for the newspaper in 
an effort to make sure we kept the 
Boundary Waters protected. 
I certainly hope that Senator ALEX-
ANDER continues to spend time there 
and enjoy our lands and help the work 
that he has done—which he has seen on 
the Great American Outdoors Act—and 
see it firsthand. 
We know that his red and black flan-
nel shirt will be welcome in Minnesota. 
It is something we see everywhere in 
Northern Minnesota and throughout 
our State, and we hope to see him back 
soon. 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL B. ENZI 
Mr. President, next, my friend Sen-
ator ENZI. True collegiality and cama-
raderie have sometimes been hard to 
come by in Washington these past few 
years, and that is why I think about 
someone who never lets the tempera-
ture rise, who is always willing to find 
that common ground. As I heard him 
say and have heard him say many 
times before his closing speech here, in 
his words, ‘‘I always believed we could 
agree on 80 percent of the issues and on 
80 percent of each issue, and that if we 
focus on the 80 percent, we can do great 
things for the American people.’’ I re-
member his saying that when he would 
work with Ted Kennedy—and their 
genuine friendship—and I remember he 
said that many times to me as we 
worked on bills together. 
One of the first bills that I worked on 
a few years coming in here was with 
Senator ENZI, and it was about our 
paramedics and using the experience 
that they had gained serving in the 
Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, making 
sure that when they came home, they 
could use that experience immediately 
and put it to work on being paramedics 
in our own country because we had a 
shortage, and we still do, and we want-
ed to respect that experience—so many 
of them in small towns where they 
would have to travel then to get the 
final degree they needed to be able to 
continue working as a paramedic. MIKE 
and I wanted to make sure that experi-
ence they had in serving our country 
would be put to good use and would 
allow them to get those degrees faster. 
I was also fortunate to work with 
MIKE on trying to turn the page on 
U.S.-Cuba policy and forge a new path. 
He was always willing to work with me 
on that and be one of the cosponsors of 
my bill to lift the embargo—something 
that I hope will eventually get done in 
his honor, as he understood that the 
way to get to democratic change in 
Cuba was by enhancing our relation-
ship and that the Cuban people did not 
necessarily share the same views—and 
many of them do not—of their govern-
ment and that so many people in Cuba 
love America and that it was very im-
portant for us to improve that rela-
tionship. 
As chair of the Budget Committee— 
and one of only two accountants in the 
Senate—Senator ENZI
has also been 
dedicated to addressing our deficit and 
debt challenges. He has long urged the 
Federal Government to move to bian-
nual budgeting, something that I sup-
port, as well, and something that my 
friend JEANNE SHAHEEN has been work-
ing with him on. 
Senator ENZI has a lot of smart pro-
posals that he has put forward. I most-
ly, though, will remember his spirit— 
his spirit that we saw, and see, every 
week 
at 
the 
Prayer 
Breakfast—of 
course, he can still come back to that 
as a former Member—but also the work 
that he did in the Senate and how he 
would genuinely try to find common 
ground. 
I have told him many times how 
much I love his State, having once bi-
cycled from Minneapolis to Jackson 
Hole to get there—1,200 miles in 11 days 
with my dad—and when my husband 
and I, in the middle of the pandemic, 
decided to drive one place this summer, 
we drove to Wyoming and hiked in the 
Tetons. So I look forward and I hope to 
see MIKE and Diana there, and my hope 
for him is all the best in his retire-
ment. 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Mr. 
President, 
Senator 
GARDNER. 
Senator GARDNER and I served together 
on the Commerce Committee, and 
throughout his tenure as a Member of 
Congress, he has been a champion of 
public lands, and, of course, with the 
beautiful, beautiful national parks in 
Colorado, I think you couldn’t be doing 
your job for your State if you weren’t 
such a leader on lands. 
He worked tirelessly to pass the very 
important Great American Outdoors 
Act—historic legislation that invests 
in our commitment to ensuring our Na-
tion’s trails, public lands, parks, and 
open spaces remain protected and ac-
cessible for generations while also per-
manently funding the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund. I was proud to co-
sponsor this legislation, which, as you 
all know, was signed into law in Au-
gust. 
We have also worked together on the 
Commerce Committee on travel and 
tourism, hit especially hard during this 
pandemic. He may have a little bigger 
ski hills than we have in Minnesota, 
maybe some higher mountains than we 
have, but we both share not only a love 
for the outdoors but also an under-
standing of how much tourism contrib-
utes to our economy. 
Together, we worked, along with 
Senator BLUNT
and Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO, to reauthorize the bipartisan 
Brand USA bill, which was also signed 
into law. Since 2013, Brand USA has 
generated a total economic impact of 
nearly $48 billion by allowing our coun-
try to pair up with the private sector 
to reach out to visitors, to get them to 
come to America, whether it is the 
Rocky 
Mountains 
in 
Colorado 
or 
whether it is the Mall of America in 
Bloomington, MN. Last year, Brand 
USA generated $4.1 billion in incre-
mental visitor spending, resulting in a 
marketing return on investment of 32 
to 1. 
I also have fond memories of getting 
to know Senator GARDNER and his wife, 
both at the last inauguration, at the 
lunch, which I will just share—not 
every detail, but let’s say it was a 
memorable lunch that we had. Then, 
also, we, one time, got to do a humor 
speech together when there was a last- 
minute cancellation, and I had 3 hours 
to fill in for the Winter Gridiron Din-
ner, and Senator GARDNER did not find 
out until I got there and had to quickly 
change his jokes from Senator WARNER/ 
TOOMEY. The jokes about billionaires 
didn’t really fit my fiscal situation—or 
millionaires. Senator GARDNER
was 
great, and we had a lot of fun that 
night as well. 
We are going to miss him and miss 
all of these Senators. One of the rea-
sons I wanted to do this all at once was 
that I think we have to remember that 
this Senate and this institution is big-
ger than ourselves, that people do come 
and go, and they all make their marks. 
You don’t necessarily remember the 
names of everyone—nor does everyone 
in your State—who is there late at 
night either passing the Great Out-
doors Act or the one who is willing to 
work with a freshman Democratic Sen-
ator to get a bill passed on paramedics 
or to be willing to take that little bit 
of a risk and work on some issues that 
maybe aren’t popular in your own po-
litical party. All of these Senators in 
their own way have shown that cour-
age, whether it is DOUG JONES giving 
his first speech on gun safety or wheth-
er it is Senator TOM UDALL, who had a 
decision to make in what he knew 
would be his last 2 years: Was he going 
to be the ranking member of the Rules 
Committee or the Indians Affairs Com-
mittee? He chose Indian Affairs be-
cause he knew that that mattered and 
that this was a group of people who had 
been so long overlooked, and he was 
going to spend his last 2 years helping 
them. 
I will miss all of these Senators. I 
know that they know their work will 
live on, but it is just a reminder to all 
of us that maybe in 100 years they 
won’t remember who we are, but people 
will be benefiting for generations to 
come from their work. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

December 15, 2020 
RECESS 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). Under the previous order, the 
Senate stands in recess until 2:15 p.m. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:30 p.m. 
recessed until 2:15 p.m. and reassem-
bled when called to order by the Pre-
siding Officer (Mrs. CAPITO). 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that notwith-
standing rule XXII, all postcloture 
time on the Kirsch nomination expire 
at 5 p.m. today; further, that if con-
firmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table and the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action; finally, 
that the mandatory quorum call with 
respect to the Crytzer nomination be 
waived. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNITED STATES SENATE 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, 
in Jon Meacham’s biography of Presi-
dent George W. Bush—actually, I be-
lieve it is in the biography of President 
George H. W. Bush—Meacham quotes 
Prescott Bush, H.W. Bush’s father and 
Senator Prescott Bush, of Connecticut, 
as saying that the Senate is the place 
where everybody in politics ultimately 
wants to be. Senator Prescott Bush, of 
Connecticut, said that the U.S. Senate 
is the place in politics where everybody 
in politics ultimately wants to be. 
I have noticed that over the years, 
after an election, usually we have lost 
about 10 Members of the Senate—some-
times a couple more, sometimes a cou-
ple less. This year, it is 7. If you look 
at Georgia and what one has to go 
through to stay here or to get here 
given the amount of money being spent 
and the number of things being said in 
those two races, you would think that 
there might be a shortage of people 
today who would want to follow Sen-
ator Prescott Bush’s advice but appar-
ently not. 
Instead of 10 people leaving this year, 
it is only 7, and only 4 of us are retiring 
voluntarily. I would like to take just a 
minute or two about each of the other 
six U.S. Senators who will not be com-
ing back in the next Congress. 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Madam President, MARTHA MCSALLY 
arrived with the same enthusiasm that 
she showed when she set records for 
women in combat as a pilot. She is a 
warrior. She knows how to take a hill. 
If you listened to her maiden address, 
which I did, and to her farewell ad-
dress, which I did, she had a great 
sense of purpose, and she had her usual 
effectiveness 
during 
her 
relatively 
short period of time in the U.S. Senate. 
She was able to pass eight pieces of leg-
islation and turn them into law. She 
made her mark during the time she 
was here. 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Madam President, as for CORY GARD-
NER, of Colorado, when he leaves the 
Senate, it will become a little bit dim-
mer of a place because CORY GARDNER 
has such cheerfulness. Everyone recog-
nizes that. He wakes up happy, and he 
goes to bed happy insofar as any of us 
here knows, and he came to the Senate 
with the same amount of enthusiasm. 
He came to me early on and wanted 
to be and agreed to be the head of the 
America COMPETES effort. That legis-
lation passed in 2005 and 2006—before 
he got here—to try to make our coun-
try more competitive in the world, but 
CORY took the leadership of that and 
led the reauthorization of it. 
He spent 2 years heading the Repub-
lican Senatorial Committee and did a 
tremendously effective job. 
Then, this year, he became a leader 
in the Great American Outdoors Act. 
Everyone agrees—there are not many 
times you can say that here, but every-
one agrees, from the left to the right 
and up and down, that the Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act is the most signifi-
cant piece of environmental and out-
door recreation legislation in at least 
the last half century—since the Eisen-
hower years, really. It was a bipartisan 
parade of Senators, the President, and 
House Members, which is the way you 
get things done here. Yet, if it were a 
parade, you would have to say CORY, 
along with STEVE
DAINES, was the 
drum major in the parade. He deserves 
great credit for that, and generations 
will be grateful to him. 
TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL B. ENZI 
Madam President, MIKE ENZI, of Wy-
oming, is retiring after 24 years. MIKE 
is an unassuming fellow. He is the only 
accountant in the Senate. He is impos-
sible to defeat in Wyoming, apparently, 
because he drives 200 or 300 miles every 
weekend to every ice cream social that 
was invented, and if it had not been in-
vented, he and Diana created it. 
While he has been here, he has cre-
ated the 80-percent rule, which says: 
Let’s not argue about the 20 percent we 
disagree on, and let’s look for the 80 
percent we can work together on. 
He was persistent in his work in the 
Marketplace Fairness Act, which kept 
the Federal Government from telling 
States what to tax and what not to tax 
and allowed the States to collect sales 
tax for goods that were sold in their 
States from out of State. That passed 
the Senate thanks to MIKE’s work. It 
didn’t pass the House, but the Senate 
agreed with Senator ENZI, and most 
States are grateful in this COVID pe-
riod of time to have their revenues en-
hanced by the work of MIKE ENZI. 
The Perkins Act—helping to create a 
better workforce in the United States— 
was a difficult bill to pass, but MIKE 
ENZI was the one who put it together. 
Of course, he left his opportunity to 
be chairman of the committee I now 
chair—Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions—so that he could be the 
chairman of the Budget Committee. 
While there, he worked hard to solve a 
problem that still needs to be solved— 
that of balancing our Federal budget, 
which, in the end, will require our find-
ing a fair way to control the growth of 
entitlements. 
TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Madam 
President, 
PAT
ROBERTS 
came to the Senate in 1967 in the way 
a lot of us have come—as a Senate 
aide. I came the same year. He worked 
for Senator Baker, who was working in 
the House of Representatives at the 
time. Yet we have seen in the Senate, 
through all of that time, its pluses and 
its minuses, and we have learned our 
way. PAT learned his way especially 
well. 
I suppose he served longer on the 
Ethics Committee and longer on the 
Agriculture Committee than anyone, 
particularly if you count his service in 
the House and the Senate on the Agri-
culture Committees. His good humor 
and his resoluteness in terms of rural 
America and making sure that the 
farmers of our country have an envi-
ronment in which they can succeed are 
legendary. I suspect for all of us, when 
we go sleep at night, that if PAT ROB-
ERTS comes into our brains, the words 
‘‘crop insurance’’ come right along be-
hind him. 
TRIBUTE TO DOUG JONES 
Madam President, DOUG JONES only 
served for a short period of time, like 
MARTHA
MCSALLY, but he made his 
mark as well. 
When he gave his farewell address, I 
was here, and I said he reminded me of 
Ted Kennedy in this way: He kept his 
liberal principles. I didn’t ever see him 
deviate from them, just like Ted Ken-
nedy. He would stand back there and 
roar about this, that, or the other and 
make great fodder for the Republican 
Lincoln Day Dinners and Reagan Day 
Dinners in Tennessee. I used to say, 
when I was elected, if they had elected 
my opponent, my opponent would have 
come up here and moved Fred Thomp-
son’s desk over, and he would have set 
it right down between Ted Kennedy 
and Hillary Clinton and made it one 
vote harder for George W. Bush to have 
led our country and represent our val-
ues. 
The Republicans liked that because 
they 
heard 
Ted 
Kennedy’s 
liberal 
speeches, but I also said, when I made 
my maiden address, that, without my 
knowing it, Senator Kennedy had gone 
around and gotten 20 Democratic co-
sponsors. He was always working to get 
a result where he could. DOUG JONES 
has been the same way here, and I want 
to congratulate him for that. 
He had a distinguished record in civil 
rights 
in 
Alabama—a 
courageous 
record—in prosecuting the Klansmen. 
He worked with TIM SCOTT, Senator 
PATTY MURRAY, and me—with Senator 
TIM SCOTT last year to permanently 
fund historically Black colleges, which 
was a goal that had been sought for 
many years—and he took a big step on 
simplifying the FAFSA, the Federal 
aid application form that 20 million 
American families fill out every year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7485 
December 15, 2020 
TRIBUTE TO TOM UDALL 
Madam President, TOM UDALL and 
Jill, his wife, are friends of mine and 
Honey’s, my wife. We have seen them 
from time to time and enjoy their com-
pany. 
Tom came to the Senate with a dis-
tinguished heritage. It is hard to talk 
about the environment in this country 
over the last 75 years without men-
tioning Stewart Udall, Mo Udall, and 
now TOM UDALL and his cousins as 
well. He, too, was an important part of 
the Great American Outdoors Act. He 
has worked hard on the Appropriations 
Interior Subcommittee, working with 
Senator MURKOWSKI not only to clean 
up the nuclear waste and defend our 
National Laboratories—we worked to-
gether on that—but he has worked on 
another area, too, and that is to make 
the Senate work and be more effective. 
He and I have had some different opin-
ions about how to do that, but I have 
no doubt that during his time here, he 
has been one of the Senators whom one 
might call an institutionalist. He is 
someone who understands as Clarence 
Thomas once said about the Supreme 
Court when someone asked him: ‘‘How 
can you and Justice Ginsburg get along 
so well when you have such different 
opinions?’’ Justice Thomas said: ‘‘We 
try to remember that the institution is 
more important than any of our opin-
ions.’’ I would say that this has been 
the attitude of Senator TOM
UDALL 
about the Senate. 
So seven of us will be leaving this 
place that Senator Prescott Bush said 
is where everybody in politics ulti-
mately wants to be. Given how hard it 
is to get here and how hard it is to stay 
here, you would think it would be a 
place that people would want to be. My 
view of the Senate is just that—that it 
is hard to get here and hard to stay 
here, but while you are here, you might 
as well try to accomplish something 
good for the country. All of these col-
leagues of mine have done that, and I 
wanted to come to the floor today to 
salute each one of them. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD
my remarks 
about each one of the Senators, as 
much as practical, following their re-
marks in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
HONORING OFFICER TRAVIS WALLACE 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today with my friend and col-
league from Arkansas to honor Helena- 
West Helena Police Officer Travis Wal-
lace, who made the ultimate sacrifice 
in the line of duty on Thursday, No-
vember 12. 
Officer Wallace was trying to appre-
hend a suspect wanted in connection 
with a violent crime the previous week. 
Using his patrol car to block the exit of 
the parking lot where he spotted the 
suspect in the vehicle, he was fired on. 
Officer Wallace returned fire but was 
struck during the gunfight. 
Officer Wallace was targeted because 
he was a law enforcement officer in 
pursuit of justice. This is a somber re-
minder of the dangers police officers 
and other members of the law enforce-
ment community face every day. They 
do so willingly, not knowing the chal-
lenges they will experience when they 
leave the comforts of their homes and 
their loved ones. 
Officer Wallace served with profes-
sionalism and dedication during his 10 
years in law enforcement. For half his 
career, he worked for the Helena-West 
Helena Police Department, where he 
demonstrated his passion and commit-
ment for helping those in need. 
The Helena-West Helena police chief 
described Officer Wallace as an ambi-
tious leader who was eager to help the 
community. Another fellow officer ap-
plauded his influence on his career and 
thanked him for the skills he taught 
his brothers in blue that have helped 
better protect that community. 
The outpouring of support from the 
Helena-West Helena residents, citizens 
across Arkansas, and the members of 
the law enforcement community has 
given the police department strength, 
as members mourn the loss of this 
brave officer. 
I join with all Arkansans in express-
ing our gratitude for Officer Wallace’s 
service and his sacrifice. We celebrate 
his life and example of courageous, 
selfless public service. May his family, 
including his son Travis Junior, find 
peace in knowing their loved one lived 
and died a true American hero. 
I yield to my colleague, Senator COT-
TON. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, one 
of the most solemn eulogies any man 
can deliver is for a fallen officer killed 
in the line of duty. Senator BOOZMAN 
and I have delivered too many of these 
eulogies already, and we regret that we 
must do so again, but we want to cele-
brate the life and service of Police Offi-
cer Travis Wallace of the Helena-West 
Helena Police Department, who died 
last month at age 41, while attempting 
to bring a murder suspect into custody. 
Officer Wallace and his partner rec-
ognized the dangerous suspect in a ve-
hicle in a motel parking lot. They con-
ducted a traffic stop. The suspect got 
out of his vehicle and immediately 
opened fire. Officer Wallace bravely 
and skillfully returned fire, causing the 
suspect to flee, but it was too late. He 
had already suffered grave wounds. He 
passed away later at the hospital, de-
spite the valiant effort of doctors to 
save his life. 
Officer Wallace believed that policing 
was his life’s calling. He had worked in 
law enforcement for almost a decade, 
including 5 years with the Helena-West 
Helena Police Department, before his 
life was so tragically cut short. 
In that brief time, Officer Wallace es-
tablished himself as a leader and not 
just in his department. He was also a 
loving father, son, and brother, known 
for his sense of humor and his ability 
to make people smile. And he was a 
man of faith, serving as a deacon at St. 
Luke Missionary Baptist Church. 
Officer Wallace served his commu-
nity with honor. Tragically, he is the 
fourth law enforcement officer from 
Arkansas killed this year and the 279th 
officer nationwide. 
Like every officer, he dedicated his 
life to protect and defend his commu-
nity. That commitment takes courage. 
It requires officers to run toward dan-
ger—to approach dangerous men when 
every human instinct might scream to 
run away. 
Officer Wallace did his job and did his 
duty with honor. Now his watch has 
ended, but we will always remember 
the great sacrifice he made to keep his 
community and our State safe. 
May he rest in peace. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO HENRY C. ‘‘HOPPY’’ SHORES 
Mrs. CAPITO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor a good friend of 
mine 
and 
to 
thank 
Commissioner 
Henry C. ‘‘Hoppy’’ Shores for his many 
years of service to Kanawha County, 
WV, and America. 
Hoppy was born in Dunbar, WV, dur-
ing the Great Depression. Hoppy lost 
his parents at a young age and moved 
in with his sister on the West Side of 
Charleston. 
In high school he attended a school 
which was then called Stonewall Jack-
son High School. Hoppy was a standout 
athlete. He played as a running back 
on the 1947 State championship team. 
In 1949, he won West Virginia’s Ken-
nedy Award, as the State’s top high 
school football player of the year. It 
was also during his high school years 
that Hoppy got an interest in politics 
when he first ran for and won the sen-
ior class presidency. 
But the most important thing that 
happened during those formative years 
was on the first day of high school, 
when Hoppy first met the love of his 
life, Bronson Garcelon. They have been 
married since 1953, and I can personally 
attest—living in the same town—that 
they have been inseparable ever since. 
He repeated his high school success 
while he was in college at West Vir-
ginia University in the 1950s and again 
became the class president. He grad-
uated from West Virginia University 
with a degree in business, and after col-
lege he enlisted in the U.S. Army, at-
taining the rank of major. 
During the years after his service, 
Hoppy grew a very successful career in 
the insurance business. 
In 1966, Hoppy was recruited to run 
for the Kanawha County Commission 
by a prominent local attorney. After he

initially refused, he eventually said, 
OK, he would run. He won and served 
an initial term, and then decided, well, 
maybe that is it. He stepped out for a 
term, but he was pulled back into the 
political arena and served another 6- 
year term. After serving that second 
term, he then served and ran and won 
two separate terms for the West Vir-
ginia House of Delegates, representing 
Kanawha County, his home. 
In 1990, he decided to return to the 
Kanawha County Commission and was 
again elected to one of the three seats. 
Voters have sent him back, with my 
help, to the commission every year 
since, making him the longest serving 
commissioner ever in the entire State. 
During his 42 years on the Kanawha 
County Commission, Hoppy accom-
plished a host of successful initiatives 
on behalf of our citizens. Of particular 
interest and importance during his ten-
ure, by the time Hoppy has left, or is 
leaving, 97 percent—and we have to get 
that to 100—but 97 percent of the coun-
ty now has potable water. And I know 
that sounds like a given, but extending 
water service to some of the areas 
through rural West Virginia is not an 
easy task, but it was one that Hoppy 
always tackled. 
Hoppy always pushed for the health 
and well-being of others, and, as such, 
with his insistence, the commission in-
stituted a program to provide free 
mammograms for county employees, 
leading to early detection of cancer 
and saving lives. 
Hoppy has always been a tireless ad-
vocate for the Kanawha County air-
port, now called the Yeager Airport, 
which was named after another famous 
West Virginian, whom we just lost, our 
aviator and American hero the late 
Chuck Yeager. 
I remember working closely with 
Hoppy in 2005, when the West Virginia 
National Guard’s 130th Airlift unit was 
slated for closure in the Department of 
Defense 2008 BRAC. That is the Base 
Realignment and Cloture report. Of 
course, Hoppy won that battle, too, and 
the 130th proudly remains at Yeager 
Airport. 
Hoppy has accomplished so much 
during his time in office that I cannot 
possibly cover everything. However, I 
would be remiss if I did not mention 
his passion for parks; his passion for 
recreation; obviously, with his past, his 
passion for athletics; and, most impor-
tantly, the children in Kanawha Coun-
ty. 
Hoppy has advocated for public recre-
ation. He has pushed for baseball, foot-
ball, soccer fields, golf courses, tennis 
courts, county fairs, hiking trails, and 
modern park facilities. In fact, Coon-
skin Park in Kanawha County, which is 
the largest public park in our county, 
is one of the nicest in the State be-
cause of Hoppy’s work. 
One of my favorite stories about 
Hoppy involves both Coonskin Park 
and Christmas. In the year 2006, when a 
small train that carried children and 
their families around Coonskin Park to 
see the holiday lights was in bad dis-
repair, Hoppy jumped in to save the 
day. He worked to find the money and 
a suitable replacement, lovingly dub-
bing it ‘‘Hoppy’s Little Express.’’ 
And can you guess who the train con-
ductor was? That is right—Commis-
sioner Hoppy Shores. At the time he 
said: 
When I look into a child’s eyes, and see a 
smile, it warms my heart to know I was able 
to help them with a new playground, park, 
baseball field or a train ride at Christmas on 
Hoppy’s Little Express. It is all about the 
children. 
Hoppy Shores knows what public 
service is all about. It is about the chil-
dren and providing a better future for 
all those you care about. Hoppy never 
forgot that, and for that, he will never 
be forgotten. 
I am sure that Hoppy has had dif-
ficult times in his life but, you know 
what, you would just never know it by 
looking at him or knowing him. He is 
always wearing his signature smile and 
always has a kind word to offer. I have 
never met someone who did not like 
Hoppy Shores, even if they disagreed 
with his politics. 
So after 42 years of service to the 
Kanawha County Commission, it is my 
honor to congratulate Commissioner 
Shores on his retirement, which will 
take effect at the end of this month. 
While I will certainly miss him, as I am 
sure many of us will—and those, par-
ticularly, in the Kanawha County 
courthouse—I 
know 
Hoppy 
and 
Bronson are looking forward to spend-
ing more time with their four chil-
dren—Scott, Lynn, Sherry, and Henry, 
who I think is called ‘‘Little Hop,’’ and 
their four grandchildren and great- 
granddaughter. 
I am also looking forward to my fre-
quent run-ins that Charlie and I have 
with Bronson and Hop at The Grill, 
while we eat hotdogs on a Saturday 
afternoon on the West Side. 
So on behalf of the State of West Vir-
ginia, it is my honor to extend my best 
wishes to my friend—all of our friend— 
a friend of Kanawha County and really 
a friend to West Virginia, Commis-
sioner Henry C. ‘‘Hoppy’’ Shores, on his 
retirement. 
Thank you, Hoppy, and congratula-
tions. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to engage in a 
colloquy with my colleagues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SAVE OUR SEAS 2.0 ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to talk today with my colleagues 
Senator MENENDEZ and Senator WHITE-
HOUSE on a really important piece of 
legislation that is heading to the Presi-
dent’s desk, and this is Save Our Seas 
2.0. 
It is the follow-on to the Save Our 
Seas Act that we passed in the Con-
gress last Congress, and that was an 
important one mostly about ocean 
cleanup, but we thought we could do 
more. We thought, working with dif-
ferent groups—so many groups—and 
the executive branch, the Trump ad-
ministration, that we could do a lot 
more. So we got to work. 
I want to thank my colleagues on the 
floor today—Senator WHITEHOUSE
of 
Rhode Island and Senator MENENDEZ of 
New Jersey—for their work, their lead-
ership, their cooperation. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE in particular I 
really want to single out as probably 
the Member of the U.S. Senate who is 
focused on our oceans. He and I started 
collaborating on these issues about 6 
years ago, right after I first came to 
the U.S. Senate, and I have learned a 
lot from Senator WHITEHOUSE on these 
issues. 
We have kind of been an odd couple. 
We don’t always agree on everything 
politically, but on these issues and a 
lot of other issues we not only agree 
but our teams work together, we work 
together, and, importantly, we are get-
ting a lot—a lot—done. 
There have been a lot of folks who 
have really helped us in this regard 
and, again, in a bipartisan way. This 
bill is an important bill. This bill had 
three committees of the U.S. Senate 
and eight committees in the House. 
So Members—whether it was Chair-
man BARRASSO and Ranking Member 
CARPER of the EPW Committee, as I 
mentioned; 
on 
Foreign 
Relations, 
Chairman RISCH; and, of course, Sen-
ator MENENDEZ as the ranking member 
on the Commerce Committee; Chair-
man WICKER
and Ranking Member 
CANTWELL; on the House side, I just got 
off the phone with the dean of the 
House, Congressman DON
YOUNG, a 
great, great Congressman; Representa-
tive BONAMICI. She also has been a 
great advocate. 
We all were aware of the challenge. 
This is a huge challenge: ocean debris, 
plastics. It is a gigantic challenge for 
my State. 
Now, I brag about Alaska a lot. Here 
is a little bit more bragging: We have 
more coastline than the rest of the 
country combined, in terms of their 
coastline. So we see the garbage. We 
see the trash. We see it, unfortunately, 
washing up on the shores of Alaska, 
and that impacts negatively not just 
the environment but the economy, our 
fishing industry, our fishing commu-
nities, our coastal communities. 
You may have heard about this 
World Economic Forum study that said 
if we don’t do anything about the pol-
lution challenge that relates to plas-
tics, by 2050 there could be more weight 
in terms of plastics in the ocean than 
there are fish. Think about that. That 
is a challenge. 
So we got to work, and here is the 
thing that I think is so exciting: This 
is a solvable issue. Estimates are that 
up to 80 percent of all plastics in the 
ocean around the globe come from 10 
rivers in Asia and Africa. So, of course, 
it has a huge international component 
to it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7487 
December 15, 2020 
But I just want to thank both Sen-
ators WHITEHOUSE and MENENDEZ. I am 
going to turn the floor over to Senator 
MENENDEZ to say a few words on this, 
particularly the international side, 
which is so important. 
I will talk a little bit more about 
what is in the legislation, but this is an 
example—and it happens a lot; we don’t 
always read about it—of this body com-
ing together on big issues and making 
a big impact. 
So Save Our Seas 2.0 is heading to 
the President’s desk. I do want to com-
pliment the President and his team. 
They had a lot to do with this. They 
have been very motivated on these 
issues as well. 
This is everybody coming together to 
address a problem that we know is a 
problem but that we can solve, and we 
are putting American leadership out 
front, which will be good for Alaska, 
good for Rhode Island, good for New 
Jersey, good for America, and good for 
the world. 
Senator MENENDEZ. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
let me thank Senator SULLIVAN for his 
introduction of our efforts here today 
and to really commend him for work-
ing in such a bipartisan spirit to drive 
an important piece of legislation, to 
really address the future of future gen-
erations of Alaskans, of Rhode Island-
ers, and New Jerseyans—and Ameri-
cans, as well as other people across the 
world. 
I agree with Senator SULLIVAN that 
Senator WHITEHOUSE’s name is synony-
mous with the oceans and his focus on 
this is singular and his perspective is of 
the utmost importance. 
I want to rise to join my colleagues 
from Alaska and Rhode Island to cele-
brate the enactment of Save Our Seas 
2.0 and to thank our colleagues, both in 
the House and the Senate, for their 
votes in support of the most com-
prehensive piece of legislation to ad-
dress the growing global environmental 
threat of plastic waste in our oceans. I 
want to thank Representatives SU-
ZANNE
BONAMICI
of Oregon and DON 
YOUNG of Alaska for their commitment 
and leadership in shepherding the bill 
through the House. 
To my colleagues, Senator SULLIVAN 
and Senator WHITEHOUSE, it has been a 
great pleasure working with you on 
these issues. The passion, the knowl-
edge, the persistence you have brought 
to solving the problem of plastic waste 
in the world’s oceans is incredible, and 
it was essential to our shared success. 
Plastic pollution in our oceans is 
truly a global problem that literally 
washes up on New Jersey shores, im-
pacting businesses and communities 
across our State. This calamity is yet 
another reminder that Americans are 
directly impacted by the policies and 
practices 
of 
countries 
around 
the 
world. Plastic debris in our oceans does 
not respect international borders. 
The abundance of plastic waste in 
our ocean requires comprehensive ac-
tion alongside the fight against cli-
mate change. Save Our Seas 2.0 will 
bolster U.S. leadership and global en-
gagement to combat plastic waste and 
marine debris, improve plastic waste 
management, and enhance marine de-
bris response and innovation. 
As the ranking member of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, I take 
special pride in the international title 
of this bipartisan legislation, which 
formalizes U.S. foreign policy to ad-
dress this issue, supports USAID’s 
work to curb ocean plastic, and encour-
ages the United States to explore the 
development of an international agree-
ment to foster cooperation on address-
ing plastic waste globally. I think this 
legislation can be the catalyst for that. 
The Earth’s oceans are a global re-
source that sustains life everywhere, 
whether it is your country, State, or 
district that has a coastline or is land-
locked. 
Eighty 
percent 
of 
New 
Jerseyans live in a coastal area, and 
our economy is heavily dependent on 
these vibrant communities. Families 
who depend on our fishing, their real 
estate, hospitality, tourism, and out-
door recreation industries rely upon 
clean and safe oceans. 
These families know that beyond 
their daily livlihoods, plastic pollution 
also threatens human health on a glob-
al scale. Once in the environment, plas-
tics accumulate in and contaminate 
both human and animal food chains 
leading to an array of health risks. 
Save Our Seas 2.0 calls on various 
agencies to research and assess the ef-
fects of microplastics and food supplies 
and sources of drinking water so that 
we can better understand the way plas-
tic is dangerous to use. 
Even at a time—this is where I will 
close—when Washington seems more 
politically divided than ever before, 
SOS 2.0 represents a significant bipar-
tisan environmental victory that I sin-
cerely hope will serve as a stepping 
stone toward more progress to tackle 
this growing global problem. 
There is no single solution to the ma-
rine debris crisis. Ocean stewardship is 
critical to preventing the collapse of 
marine ecosystems that support global 
fisheries that feed billions of people 
around the world. Addressing plastic 
waste of the ocean supports economic 
growth and trade, public health, and 
safe recreation. 
I look forward to building upon the 
bipartisan support we have achieved 
with this bill and working with the 
next administration on ensuring the 
dutiful execution of the programs we 
established in SOS 2.0 and securing ap-
propriations in support of the bill’s 
goals and objectives. 
Again, with my congratulations to 
my colleagues and my thanks for the 
work they have done together, I will 
yield the floor to our colleague from 
Rhode Island. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, today is a happy day for me to be 
joining my friends Senator MENENDEZ 
and Senator SULLIVAN here on the Sen-
ate floor to celebrate the successful 
conclusion of a second chapter in a 
long effort to address the problem of 
ocean plastics pollution, which has 
been described so well by my friend 
Senator SULLIVAN. 
When we began, there was actually 
no program whatsoever on ocean plas-
tics in the Senate. There had never 
been legislation in this area. With Sen-
ator SULLIVAN’s support, we decided to 
see what the traffic would bear, see 
what the Senate and the House might 
tolerate in terms of legislating in a 
new area. For that, we undertook the 
Save Our Seas bill. And at the end of 
the day, after a certain amount of stat-
ic, actually on both sides of the aisle, 
we were able to get Save Our Seas 
passed by unanimous consent. Every 
single Member of the Senate had to 
agree to it. To me, that was a really 
exciting test to the proposition that 
Senators actually care about this. One 
of my favorite moments in that whole 
episode was when a Senator, with 
whom I am often at war—Senator 
INHOFE
of landlocked Oklahoma—be-
came an ally and a friend and a sup-
porter of Save Our Seas, the original 
bill. And he did so because he had 
childhood experiences on the gulf coast 
with sea turtles that made him care 
about the plastic that was piling up in 
the oceans and strangling and drown-
ing sea creatures. 
It has, this topic, a gift, I guess, for 
bringing people together. And based on 
that success and that unanimous con-
sent—and it cleared the House the 
same way on what they call suspension 
over there—we undertook 2.0; 2.0 is 
going to be bigger, better than 1.0. And 
it sure is bigger, better. And the role of 
Senator MENENDEZ
in putting some 
real structure to the international 
component of this was essential. 
Senator MENENDEZ
is our ranking 
member on the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. In that role, he was essential in 
seeing to it that this bill, with such a 
big Foreign Relations Committee foot-
print, cleared that committee with mo-
mentum and good to go. 
We are now in the happy position 
that 2.0 has passed as well. It creates a 
new marine debris foundation. It cre-
ates a genius prize for innovation in 
trying to get rid of or reinvent or re-
imagine our plastic disposal system. It 
creates new research to tackle this 
issue. It focuses more, as I said, di-
rectly on our international relations 
because so much of the marine plastic 
waste comes out of foreign shores and 
down foreign rivers. It also focuses on 
our domestic waste management pro-
gram. 
This is a good step. I have heard peo-
ple say that 2.0 is not enough. Darn 
right it is not enough, but this is how 
you build momentum. You prove that 
you can do something and that the 
Senate is willing to act on it. Then, 
you stand on that platform and you 
build a bigger, better bill, and you get

that passed. And now Senator SUL-
LIVAN and I are already discussing what 
3.0 might look like. 
I am not in a position to speak for 
Senator SULLIVAN, but I am interested 
in looking under the hood of the recy-
cling industry. When you put your 
plastic waste into a blue bin to go off 
and get recycled, how much of it actu-
ally does get recycled? How can we 
make sure that there is, in fact, a cir-
cle in which plastic gets manufactured, 
put into use, brought back out of the 
system, and not left in the ocean, not 
left as waste on our lands? How can 
you develop what is called the circular 
economy for plastic? 
Plastic is a weird thing. Nature 
hasn’t seen plastic before. It doesn’t 
biodegrade the way things that were 
made by the Lord biodegrade. Nothing 
eats it. If something does eat it, it just 
piles up in its body or goes through it 
neutrally. It provides no nutrition or 
value to anything. It is just this new 
thing out there. We need to figure out 
how to deal with it, and we need to get 
it the heck out of our oceans. 
More to come on this. But let me 
take this moment to thank Senator 
MENENDEZ for his leadership, particu-
larly, on the foreign side of this, and 
Senator SULLIVAN
for his leadership 
and for being such a terrific ally in this 
cause. 
With that, I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Let me wrap up here 
by mentioning that, as we already 
talked about, the Congressional Re-
search Service has called this the most 
comprehensive ocean cleanup legisla-
tion ever to come out of the Congress. 
As Senator WHITEHOUSE said, 6 years 
ago, we were starting at nothing. And 
then we got Save Our Seas 1.0, pri-
marily about cleaning up our own 
coastlines. 
There are a lot of funny stories there, 
but we did have a really interesting— 
and I thought entertaining—signing 
ceremony at the White House with the 
President and Senator WHITEHOUSE. 
The two hadn’t met before. They got 
along really well, particularly talking 
about this issue. And it did motivate 
the Trump administration to start fo-
cusing more. You may have seen in the 
new NAFTA, the USMCA, the first 
trade agreement has a whole section on 
ocean cleanup and a whole section on 
fisheries and sustainable fisheries. This 
is a really important precedent for the 
U.S. government, regardless of party. 
As Senator MENENDEZ mentioned, a 
lot of focus internationally. I want to 
thank him again, in terms of the For-
eign Relations Committee. Our ability 
to help other countries—we are cer-
tainly not perfect, but the big chal-
lenge on a lot of the oceans, in terms of 
cleanup and what comes onto the 
shores of the United States, what 
comes onto the shores of Alaska in 
terms of plastics and pollution, comes 
from overseas. We need to help there. 
As Senator WHITEHOUSE
also men-
tioned, improving our domestic infra-
structure to prevent marine debris—so 
we are setting our own example, not 
just helping other countries—and then 
enhancing our own domestic response. 
Senator WHITEHOUSE mentioned this 
Marine Debris Foundation. This is a 
congressionally chartered private orga-
nization. There are not many in the 
country. This is a big deal. Thank the 
Red Cross. Thank the American Le-
gion. These are congressionally char-
tered organizations that will give this 
effort public-private partnership en-
ergy to address the problem. That is 
exactly what we are focused on here, 
and that is why we thought it was so 
important to have a Marine Debris 
Foundation as an enduring element of 
the U.S. leadership that is now exem-
plified by Save our Seas 2.0. 
I will mention one final thing. You 
know, one of the things that I thought 
was very important—we are going to 
keep this together—is we worked hard 
not to single out one industry or one 
area: Hey, you are not doing a good 
job; you need to get your act together. 
What we said when we put this bill to-
gether is we are going to bring in all 
the stakeholders—Democrats, Repub-
licans, the executive branch, Federal 
agencies, industry, key environmental 
groups, 
ocean 
conservancy, 
World 
Wildlife Foundation—and get every-
body together—the Alliance to End 
Plastic Waste, which is an initiative in 
the private sector, and say: What can 
we do together to solve this problem? 
That is what we did. All the stake-
holders 
came 
together. 
Everybody 
worked closely together, good ideas, 
pulling on the same oar. And that is 
how we got this done. 
You know, one of our finest Senators, 
LAMAR ALEXANDER, gave his farewell 
speech just last week, and he talked 
about this idea of a split screen in the 
Senate. Yes, there is contention. Yes, 
there are battles. The media loves to 
play those up. But there is also another 
element about what we do here where 
there is strong bipartisan support on 
really big issues: the CARES Act, the 
NDAA, the Great American Outdoors 
Act—probably the biggest conservation 
bill in 50 years—21st Century Cures; 
these are all things that we are getting 
done here that matter to the American 
people in a bipartisan way. You don’t 
always read about them in the press, 
but they are still happening. And now 
we can add to that list the biggest 
ocean cleanup legislation in the his-
tory of the country going to the Presi-
dent’s desk for signing here in the next 
couple of days. It is something our fel-
low Americans should know about. And 
as Senator WHITEHOUSE said, we are 
going to build on that too. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, I should add a few other thank- 
yous because this, obviously, took a lot 
of effort to get through all these dif-
ferent committees in the Senate and 
the House and to get it passed on the 
Senate and House floor. I want to start 
on the House side, with the equivalent 
of the Whitehouse-Sullivan show is the 
Young-Bonamici show on the other 
side; Representative BONAMICI and Rep-
resentative YOUNG, whom Senator SUL-
LIVAN mentioned, were the key people 
working this issue. 
I want to thank my delegation, JIM 
LANGEVIN
and DAVID
CICILLINE, be-
cause, during key points when it 
looked like things were jamming up 
over there, they jumped up with their 
leadership and with their colleagues to 
help move things along, and I believe 
Representative YOUNG did as well. 
I want to thank the majority leader, 
STENY HOYER, who at a really critical 
moment, when this could have gone 
one way or another, made sure it went 
the right way and got us teed up to get 
the thing done in the House and back 
here where we could move it in the 
Senate. 
In the Senate, I have spoken about 
Senator MENENDEZ’s critical role, but, 
of course, as chairman, Senator RISCH 
also had to support and permit this to 
go forward. It had to clear Commerce, 
where Senator WICKER
and Senator 
CANTWELL were supportive and helped 
move this along. Senator WICKER, in-
deed, has been a member of our Oceans 
Caucus from an early stage and has 
been very helpful on oceans issues. 
Then on our—Senator SULLIVAN’s and 
my—Environment and Public Works 
Committee, Chairman BARRASSO
and 
our ranking member, Senator CARPER, 
were all very supportive. 
Things like this don’t get done with-
out a lot of people pulling together, 
and I just wanted to make sure that I 
thanked all of them as I close out here 
on this subject. 
So thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

FIRST STEP ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as we approach the holiday season, 
many of us will be celebrating dif-
ferently. COVID–19 may be limiting 
travel, family members we see in per-
son, or other holiday traditions. Yet 
there is much to be grateful for. 
For me, I am thankful for my health, 
my family, my country, and my staff. I 
am also grateful to serve Iowans and 
work in the Senate to tackle legisla-
tion, conduct oversight, and work for 
the best interests of the people of Iowa. 
I am also thankful to reflect upon 
previous accomplishments. This time 
of year coincides with a milestone 
achievement, that being the anniver-
sary of the passage of the FIRST STEP 
Act, and to remember that the crimi-
nal justice reform bill that we call the 
FIRST STEP Act is the most com-
prehensive overhaul of criminal justice 
legislation in a generation. 
On December 18, 2018, the Senate 
passed the most significant criminal 
justice reform legislation in a genera-
tion, and 3 days later, President Trump 
signed the bill into law. The FIRST

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7489 
December 15, 2020 
STEP Act is an example of what the 
Senate can accomplish when we reach 
across the aisle to address our Nation’s 
most pressing problems. I am proud 
that the FIRST STEP Act has been the 
law of the land now for 2 years. 
The past 2 years have been uniquely 
challenging. In the first year of the 
law’s tenure, I worked with Senate 
partners to oversee its implementation 
efforts. This included meeting with 
critical stakeholders in the Justice De-
partment, reviewing the status of the 
law’s implementation, and ensuring 
that the law’s application reflected 
congressional intent. 
In that first year, we accomplished a 
lot together, in a bipartisan way. Be-
cause of the FIRST STEP Act, thou-
sands of inmates received the benefits 
of the retroactive application of the 
Fair Sentencing Act to resolve sen-
tencing disparities that came about 
from legislation, I suppose, from al-
most 30 years ago between those con-
victed for crack and those convicted 
for cocaine. 
In this first year, the Justice Depart-
ment also released its risk and needs 
assessment system—a tool used to indi-
vidually review the recidivism risk of 
each Federal inmate and place the in-
mate in programming to prevent future 
criminal acts. The Bureau of Prisons 
also issued procedures for more effi-
cient access and use of the home con-
finement program. 
Implementation efforts have faced 
significant challenges, however, name-
ly, the COVID–19 pandemic. Fortu-
nately, the FIRST STEP Act provided 
tools that the administration has been 
able to use to help vulnerable inmates. 
During the pandemic, it has become ap-
parent that inmates who are confined 
in Federal prisons are among the most 
vulnerable populations in the United 
States. As they are in Federal custody, 
it is quite obvious the Federal Govern-
ment has a duty to ensure they are 
treated humanely. 
To that end, Senator DURBIN and I 
urged the increased review of compas-
sionate release and elderly home deten-
tion cases in light of the COVID–19 
cases within our Federal prisons. We 
also asked the Justice Department in-
spector general to review the use of 
home confinement authority, the pre-
ventative safety measures connected 
with it, COVID–19 testing, screening, 
and isolation measures, and the avail-
ability of access by inmates to elec-
tronic communication. I am pleased to 
say that this administration responded 
to many of our requests, though more 
work needs to be done as we continue 
to grapple with the effects of COVID–19 
in our Federal prisons. 
One of the most important issues we 
must address is a key provision of the 
FIRST STEP Act, that being the re-
quirement for the Bureau of Prisons to 
make programming available to pris-
oners to help them to live productive 
lives once they leave prison, and that 
will make it less likely, then, they will 
return to lives of crime. 
The coronavirus has made it impos-
sible for the Bureau of Prisons, at least 
at this time, to provide this program-
ming as the law intends and requires 
because, as you know, inmates must be 
socially distanced from each other to 
prevent the virus’s spread, which flies 
in the face of meeting in person to par-
ticipate in recidivism reduction pro-
gramming. Therefore, as we move for-
ward, balancing effective programming 
access with the CDC-approved safety 
measures is critical. 
As I return to the leadership of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, whether 
that is as ranking member or chair-
man, depending upon the outcome of 
the Georgia races, I want everybody to 
know that I am going to continue to 
make 
the 
implementation 
of 
the 
FIRST STEP Act a priority and will 
ensure the Justice Department and the 
Bureau of Prisons faithfully execute 
the law. 
Lastly, as we embark on a new Con-
gress and a new year, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
seek the middle ground on criminal 
justice reform. We have done it before, 
and we can do it again, and more needs 
to be done. 
The FIRST STEP Act has made a dif-
ference in the lives of thousands of 
prisoners, and it will continue to im-
pact many in the Federal criminal jus-
tice system. It gives prisoners a better 
opportunity to leave their criminal 
pasts behind and become productive 
members of society. In fact, we learned 
that from States like Texas, Mis-
sissippi, and North and South Carolina, 
where they actually did a good job of 
preparing people to return to society, 
with productive lives, saving the tax-
payers money if there is not recidi-
vism. Some of those States have even 
shut down some prisons. 
Alerted to that, too often, Congress 
waits to learn something from our lab-
oratories of our political system—the 
States. We learned a lot that brought 
about the FIRST STEP Act. There is 
more that we can learn, and we can 
build on the FIRST STEP Act. It is re-
markable what we were able to achieve 
2 short years ago. I am hopeful to carry 
that spirit into 2021 and beyond, wheth-
er I am chairman or ranking member 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
SPECIAL
INSPECTOR
GENERAL
FOR
PANDEMIC 
RECOVERY
EXPEDITED
HIRING
AUTHORITIES 
ACT OF 2020 
Now, Madam President, I have one 
other short point I would like to make 
that deals directly with negotiations 
going on right now for a COVID–19 
package that we are trying to put to-
gether. Some people call it a stimulus 
package or something that could be 
put in the omnibus appropriations bill. 
This goes back to the CARES Act 
that we passed in March when Congress 
authorized the creation of a Special In-
spector General for Pandemic Recovery 
to oversee the billions of dollars in new 
Federal spending—hence, to make sure 
that those Federal dollars were spent 
according to the law. In the past, when 
Congress created a special inspector 
general to fill a sudden need in new 
government oversight, this Congress 
quickly followed with additional legis-
lation to provide the IG with expedited 
hiring authority to staff his new offices 
and also to begin timely oversight op-
erations. Such timely oversight oper-
ations are particularly needed now be-
cause so much of this CARES money 
that was appropriated in March has 
gone out the door. 
So, in the tradition of past Con-
gresses setting up other special IGs to 
fill a sudden need, I introduced S. 3751, 
a bipartisan piece of legislation mod-
eled on past special IG expedited hiring 
authority language. My bill provides 
the IG a short 6-month window to 
quickly hire the staff he needs to build 
his organization and begin carrying out 
the oversight mandated by Congress 
under the CARES Act. However, as of 
today, my bill still hasn’t passed, and 
IG Miller has been left to work with an 
office that is still highly understaffed. 
That is an outcome that should con-
cern everyone here in the Senate if you 
are passionate about government over-
sight and making sure that money is 
spent responsibly. Whenever the gov-
ernment spends large sums of money, 
as we have in addressing this pan-
demic, there will always be bad actors 
somewhere out there, lying in wait, to 
test the system to see how much they 
can steal. We need a fully staffed and 
fully functional IG in place to meet 
those bad actors head-on to serve as an 
effective check on waste, fraud, and 
abuse. 
Despite broad support for my bill 
from both sides of the aisle, I have 
heard rumors that some of my col-
leagues across the aisle may be wary of 
granting expedited hiring authority to 
the IG simply because they don’t agree 
with the personal politics of the indi-
vidual confirmed for that position. 
This amounts to an attempt to nullify 
the IG’s confirmation by limiting his 
ability to conduct oversight and, hope-
fully, to make sure that all of the 
money that we are spending under all 
of these pandemic appropriations we 
have made is spent according to the 
law; hopefully, that implies responsibly 
spending the money. 
Congress has already made the deci-
sion to establish this IG. Now we need 
to give the office the resources it needs 
to succeed. Personal and political dis-
agreements are not reasons to deny the 
American people oversight of how bil-
lions of their tax dollars are being 
spent. Once the IG hires staff and has 
the ability to begin the substantive 
oversight work mandated by Congress, 
there will, as always, be an important 
place for congressional oversight to en-
sure the IG is doing his job. 
I intend to conduct the same level of 
oversight of this IG that I have for oth-
ers. I expect my colleagues will do the 
same. 
That is why I urge my colleagues, re-
gardless of any personal differences 
that they have, to support this bipar-
tisan legislation granting expedited

hiring authority for the Special IG for 
Pandemic Recovery and included in the 
forthcoming COVID legislation. 
Now, I have heard rumors within the 
last hour that there has already been a 
decision that they are not going to 
move ahead on this money for hiring to 
get this job. If that is true, I don’t 
want anybody, whether it is a Repub-
lican or a Democrat, to ever complain 
about something that comes to light, 
that the money wasn’t spent the way it 
was intended to be spent or it was 
wasted here or wasted there. Don’t 
complain to me. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam Presi-
dent, while Senator GRASSLEY is on the 
floor, I would thank him for his re-
marks about the First Step Act and let 
him know that on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I look forward to working with 
him to continue to advance that. 
As the Senate knows, the Grassley- 
Durbin segment and the Cornyn-White-
house segment were the two key pieces 
of that bill, and it is terrific to hear 
the Senator and our chairman at the 
time chose support to continue that 
work. So I am grateful. 
What I would like to do now is to fol-
low the conversation we had about 
oceans a minute ago in the context of 
my ‘‘Time to Wake Up’’ speeches. 
Obviously, the oceans are taking a 
colossal beating from climate change, 
from the warming, from the chemical 
acidification that it causes. It is warm-
ing at a rate of multiple detonations of 
Hiroshima-level nuclear weapons per 
second in the ocean. That is the 
amount of heat that is added, if you 
want to put an image to it. 
So we have done some good things on 
oceans in this Congress, and I would 
like to summarize some of those. 
One, obviously, is Save Our Seas 2.0 
that 
Senator 
SULLIVAN, 
Senator 
MENENDEZ, and I just discussed, but we 
also have a little package of enforce-
ment provisions in the National De-
fense Authorization Act that focus on 
what is commonly called illegal, unre-
ported, and unregulated fishing—IUU 
fishing—which is a really boring and 
bureaucratic name for extremely bad 
behavior. 
Essentially, it is modern slavery at 
sea for the crew, who are miserably 
trapped on these illegal, pirate fishing 
vessels. They are also an avenue for 
trafficking of humans, of narcotics, of 
arms, or whatever. Once you are out in 
a boat outside, beyond the realm of the 
law, operating illegally and doing 
whatever you can for money, you will 
do pretty much anything there is. So 
in addition to ransacking our common 
seas, these pirate fishing fleets are 
really dangerous vectors for really dan-
gerous criminal conduct. 
I am glad that we have put a little 
more heat on the Navy to up its game 
and report on its implementation of 
previously passed measures. I am glad 
that we have directed the Navy to 
work with the Coast Guard, which has 
the substantive jurisdiction over all of 
this, and to work with the private sec-
tor involved in solutions to this. There 
are such things as private sector sat-
ellites that track the wake and the sig-
nal of these illegal fishing vessels, and 
coordinating that with our intelligence 
and our research I think will really 
help in fighting that battle, so that we 
are sharing the information that we 
can and gathering the information that 
we can to be more effective. 
Finally, as I recall from my travels 
with the late Senator McCain, when 
you went to coastal countries near 
China, you always heard the same com-
plaint. We went to the Philippines and 
heard it. We went to Vietnam and 
heard it. We went to Indonesia and 
heard it. There are probably others if I 
could remember more clearly that I 
could add to that list. But the com-
plaint was that the Chinese fishing 
fleet is incredibly aggressive, it is tres-
passing into foreign sovereign waters, 
it is fishing illegally and outside of any 
respect for the domestic protections of 
these nations, and it is often violently 
protected by Chinese vessels, by navy 
or other vessels of the Chinese Govern-
ment. So focusing on that as a place to 
push back and protect our oceans while 
at the same time diminishing this bad 
behavior by China is also a good thing. 
So that was our suite of progress on 
pirate fishing in the NDAA. 
In the omnibus, we expect at least $75 
million to go, for the first time, into a 
new fund to tackle ocean plastics and 
for ocean plastic work in the adminis-
tration. 
So those are bits of good news, and I 
am delighted that those things have 
happened. The less good news from this 
past year is that coasts remain sadly 
underfunded, and we have missed some 
real opportunities. 
Two of the accounts that dem-
onstrate how badly funded coasts are 
facing these threats from the changing 
oceans are the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund, which should properly 
be called the inland and freshwater 
conservation fund, and the Army Corps 
Flood and Coastal Storm Damage Re-
duction Fund. 
If you go back and look at how this 
money actually gets spent, for every 
dollar that the Land and Water Con-
servation Fund spends in an inland 
State, in a landlocked State, per cap-
ita, it spends only 40 cents in a coastal 
State—a dollar per capita inland, 40 
cents per capita coastal. And that ac-
tually understates the coastal discrep-
ancy because it doesn’t count the 
spending in coastal States that isn’t on 
coasts. You have coastal States like 
New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas 
that have big, big upland inland areas 
in which most of the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund money goes. 
So what we really ought to do is call 
this what it is, which is an inland and 
freshwater conservation fund, and have 
a parallel coastal and saltwater preser-
vation fund to make sure that coasts 
are treated fairly. 
I did not even get the chance to ask 
for some adjustments to treat coasts 
more fairly as an amendment when we 
reconsidered the Land and Water Con-
servation in the so-called Great Amer-
ican Outdoors Act, which was frus-
trating because everybody—at least on 
my side of the aisle—talks a good game 
about how we need to have more 
amendments, we need to have more 
amendments. That deal got locked 
down before it got to the Senate floor. 
Nobody was allowed an amendment. So 
that was frustrating, but we will fight 
on because coasts need to be treated 
fairly, and with sea level rise and 
warming and fisheries moving about 
and storm surge worsening and more 
hurricanes, the dangers to coasts are 
greater than before, not less. 
On the Army Corps account, that is 
even more extreme. If you go back 
through the last 10 years, the best year 
the coasts had in the flood and coastal 
storm damage account was 1 coastal 
dollar for every 19 inland dollars—1 
coastal dollar for every 19 inland dol-
lars. Tell me how that is fair to coasts 
facing those same risks. And that is 
the best year. The worst year was 120 
times more for inland projects than for 
coastal projects—less than a penny on 
the dollar. Less than a penny on the 
dollar for America’s coasts. 
So we have a lot of work to do to 
make sure that we are doing what we 
need to do for our coasts. I am hoping 
that we can move the OFFSHORE 
Act—that there is even a faint chance 
of getting it done in the last few days. 
It had a successful hearing in Energy 
and Natural Resources. It has 19 bipar-
tisan cosponsors, including Commerce 
Chairman WICKER, and it would treat 
wind energy offshore the same way for 
revenues that we treat oil drilling off-
shore—i.e., 37.5 percent to the nearby 
State, 12.5 percent to a dedicated fund. 
In this case, it would be the Oceans and 
Coastal Fund because it is oceans and 
coastal. It is one of the ironies that 
most of the money that comes off of 
coastal oil drilling—offshore oil drill-
ing—gets moved into the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund, where it 
goes out West and is spent on inland, 
not coastal, projects. 
So we continue to have real work to 
do. There is the BLUE GLOBE Act, 
which I have with Senator MURKOWSKI, 
on data monitoring in the oceans and 
Great Lakes—we are going to continue 
to push forward—and our Blue Carbon 
bill, which will help us address the 
changes in the oceans that climate 
change is wreaking. With Blue Carbon, 
things like growing mangroves are in-
credibly powerful as a carbon sink, 
kelp and sea grass—to get that re-
search done and do the work we need to 
to deacidify our oceans while we still 
have reefs that are alive. 
My ideal would be a ‘‘big blue bill’’— 
a big blue bill that combines BLUE 
GLOBE, Blue Carbon, and others and,

for once, finally, finally, finally, fi-
nally, finally takes our oceans and 
coasts seriously. 
I get that we are terrestrial mam-
mals, but a lot of us care for our 
coasts, a lot of us care for our seas, a 
lot of our economies are dependent on 
our oceans, and the health of the plan-
et is dependent on the cooling and on 
the oxygen that oceans provide. So we 
mess around with our oceans at our 
peril. 
I hope that the Biden administration 
will take climate change as deadly se-
rious as it needs to be taken and that 
it will step up a significant step from 
the degree of attention climate change 
got in the Obama administration. 
We have to recognize the danger to 
our future if we remain negligent—it is 
that simple. And we have to make sure 
we free ourselves from the thrall of the 
fossil fuel industry’s climate denial 
machine because the fossil fuel indus-
try does not want what is best for 
America, does not want what is best 
for people, does not want what is best 
for oceans and the environment; it 
wants what is best for its profits, pe-
riod, and end of story. 
So we really, really, really, under the 
Biden administration, need a serious 
climate bill to safeguard the oceans on 
the only planet that we call home. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in 
morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
today to unfortunately look back with 
sadness on the deadly toll of COVID–19 
this year. I will focus my remarks on 
my home State of Pennsylvania, but of 
course the stories that I will relate 
about individuals we lost—of course 
many of them could be told in so many 
other States. 
As of today, the middle of today, 
there have been some 301,264 deaths in 
the United States due to COVID–19, in-
cluding 12,890—12,890—deaths in Penn-
sylvania. While I wish I could recognize 
and honor the memories of each of 
those individuals, that recognition, of 
course, would take longer than I have 
time set aside on the floor to speak, so 
instead I will share the stories of just 
5 Pennsylvanians who have lost their 
lives to this terrible disease—5 stories, 
5 families, from one corner of our State 
to the other, east to west, throughout 
our 67 counties. 
REMEMBERING WALTER RASICH 
The first person I will talk about is 
Walter Rasich. Walter moved into 
Whitehall Manor, which is a long-term 
care facility in Whitehall, PA. That is 
in Lehigh County, which is on the east-
ern border of our State, on the border 
just next to New Jersey, the so-called 
Lehigh Valley. 
Walter moved into that long-term 
care facility in October of 2019. Wal-
ter’s son Andy shared his story with 
my office. 
Walter Rasich was a widower, and he 
has two sons and two daughters. He 
was a beloved grandfather to eight and 
a great-grandfather to seven. He was 
also an avid toy collector of Matchbox 
cars. Some of Walter’s pastimes were 
working in the garage, hunting and 
fishing with his children, and also 
being with his grandchildren and his 
great-grandchildren. 
Walter retired after 42 years, working 
as an electrical inspector for the steel 
industry. 
Walter’s nursing home locked down 
when the pandemic hit, and his family, 
like so many American families, was 
no longer allowed to visit. On April 20, 
2020—that was a Monday—his son re-
ceived a call that his father was going 
to the hospital with a fever of 102. Wal-
ter’s family learned that Walter had 
passed away on April 24, just 4 days 
later—Thursday, April 24, 2020. He was 
86 years old. They learned that he was 
the third resident of his nursing home 
to die of COVID–19. 
So we express our condolences to 
Walter’s family. 
REMEMBERING KARIN PORTER 
Karin Porter of Philadelphia spent 35 
years as an investigator for the Federal 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission, which many know as the 
EEOC. As many people know, the 
EEOC is responsible for enforcing Fed-
eral anti-discrimination laws in the 
workplace and protecting workers and 
job applicants who have faced discrimi-
nation. 
Karin was from Philadelphia, as I 
mentioned, and she raised her grand-
daughter 
Krystin. 
According 
to 
Krystin, Karin loved to travel. She 
loved to swim and to dance, and she 
was an avid shopper. Everyone loved 
Karin, and she was always the life of 
the party. 
Karin got sick with COVID–19 right 
after her 69th birthday and died in 
April of this year. 
In remembering her grandmother, 
Krystin said: ‘‘To know her, was to 
love her.’’ Like so many families, as 
well, Karin’s death was very sudden, 
and like too many others this year, all 
across our State and across the coun-
try, she has left behind a family in 
grief as they endure her passing. 
So we send our sympathies and con-
dolences to Karin Porter’s family. 
REMEMBERING ALLAN COHEN 
Third, we go from one end of our 
State to the other, from Philadelphia 
all the way to Pittsburgh, to talk 
about a third Pennsylvanian. This indi-
vidual’s name was Allan Cohen. 
Allan Cohen was a civil rights leader 
and advocate from Pittsburgh. He was 
93 years old when he passed away on 
July 31 of this year. 
Allan spent his life fighting for jus-
tice. As a young adult, he traveled to 
Mississippi to help Black voters to reg-
ister to vote. He was here in Wash-
ington to hear the Reverend Dr. Martin 
Luther King, Jr.’s famous ‘‘I Have a 
Dream’’ speech in 1963, part of the 
great March on Washington that year. 
Allan was a lawyer. He went to the 
University of Pittsburgh, both for his 
undergraduate degree as well as for his 
law degree. He specialized in ‘‘fighting 
for the underdog,’’ as his son Norman 
said in Allan’s obituary, taking on per-
sonal injury cases for blue-collar work-
ers, just by way of one example. 
He was also a dedicated family man. 
Allan Cohen and his wife Lois were 
married for 66 years. They raised two 
sons. Allan’s wife Lois contracted 
COVID–19 and has been fortunate to re-
cover. Their family describes this cou-
ple as ‘‘the perfect match.’’ 
In retirement, Allan liked to audit 
classes at the University of Pittsburgh, 
his alma mater. He also liked to gar-
den. His son Norm recalled ‘‘the best 
vacations’’ as a child, including a 
cross-country road trip. Once Norm 
and his brother Lawrence were grown 
up, they would take their father Allan 
and their mom Lois on vacations, in-
stead, I guess as a way to return the 
favor for those vacations when they 
were young. 
Allan’s family remembers him, of 
course, as a civil rights advocate and a 
skilled orator who loved to travel. In 
the words of his granddaughter Molly, 
as quoted in his obituary, ‘‘What I ad-
mire most about my grandpa was his 
integrity and how he always made 
things light and fun.’’ Molly went on to 
say: ‘‘When things in the world are un-
just, Grandpa always speaks up and 
does what he can to make a dif-
ference.’’ 
In addition to his wife, sons, and 
granddaughter Molly, Allan left behind 
seven other grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild. So we are thinking 
today of Allan Cohen’s family and offer 
our condolences and sympathies. 
REMEMBERING DR. VICTOR RIVERA 
Now we go back to the eastern side of 
the State, to Bucks County, PA, to 
talk about Dr. Victor Rivera, who was 
a retired pediatrician from Langhorne, 
which is in Bucks County, of course, 
just north of Philadelphia, very close 
to the New Jersey border as well. 
Dr. Rivera practiced medicine for 
over 40 years, treating thousands of 
local children. He volunteered for med-
ical missions and cared for children 
abroad. He leaves behind a loving fam-
ily—his wife Mila, four children, and 
extended family all around the world. 
Dr. Rivera was fondly remembered by 
his community after he died from 
COVID–19 complications in April of 
this year. They described Dr. Rivera as 
a father figure, someone dedicated to 
his patients but also his staff, who con-
nected with his patients—in the words 
of one person, ‘‘a kind, gentle soul.’’ 
In some cases, Dr. Rivera treated 
multiple generations of the same fam-
ily. When his patients grew up, they 
brought their own children back to his 
care. 
Many commented on his big heart, 
his warm smile, and his ‘‘magical’’ 
singing voice. Even when he was hos-
pitalized for COVID–19, Dr. Rivera was

singing to the nurses in the intensive 
care unit and cracking jokes. 
After retirement, he kept working 
shifts. When he wasn’t working, he and 
Mila would travel, and that is how he 
contracted COVID–19, returning from 
an international trip just as the pan-
demic was worsening. 
Dr. Rivera, like so many others who 
have died from COVID–19, leaves a big 
hole in his community. So we also offer 
our condolences and sympathies to Dr. 
Rivera’s family. 
REMEMBERING THEODORE ‘‘TED’’ WATTS 
Finally, for the fifth Pennsylvanian 
whom I will talk about, we go back out 
to the northwestern end of the State— 
Northwestern Pennsylvania, Crawford 
County. 
Theodore Watts was known as ‘‘Ted.’’ 
Ted Watts, as he was known, is some-
one who was born in Pittsburgh, PA, 
but he spent most of his life in Mead-
ville which, as I mentioned, is in 
Crawford County, just south of Erie, 
just to give people the geography. 
Ted was a lawyer who first served his 
country in the JAG Corps of the U.S. 
Army. After separating from the Army, 
Ted married Shirley Barnett, and they 
settled in Meadville, PA, where Ted 
went into private practice. 
Ted also served as the solicitor for 
the Penncrest School District and 
served as the Crawford County solicitor 
and the legal representative for the 
housing authority and the water au-
thority of Meadville in Crawford Coun-
ty. 
One of his most significant profes-
sional accomplishments came through 
his time as an attorney for the redevel-
opment authority, during which time 
he helped to set the stage for future 
‘‘brownfields’’ legislation to safely re-
claim contaminated industrial sites. 
Ted is remembered by his family, 
friends, and colleagues for being com-
munity-oriented, a mentor, and some-
one who would ‘‘do anything,’’ as some-
one said, for the people he cared most 
about. 
He was an avid runner, finishing 
more than 40 marathons, and was the 
power behind the Thurston Classic, a 
large hot air balloon rally. 
Ted loved the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
holding season tickets, and was both 
an athlete and a great coach for soccer 
and a referee for football. 
Ted passed away from complications 
of COVID–19 in October of this year and 
leaves behind an extended family, as 
well as many people in Meadville and 
Crawford 
County 
whose 
lives 
he 
touched through his years of public 
service. 
We, of course, offer our condolences 
and sympathies to Ted’s family. 
Let me say in conclusion that the 
Pennsylvanians whose stories I shared 
today are, of course, just a fraction—a 
fraction—of the now 12,890 deaths in 
our Commonwealth. Sadly, given the 
current rate at which the virus is 
spreading nationwide and in our State, 
the death toll will only rise higher in 
the coming weeks and months. On a 
day like today—and, I hope, on so 
many other days—we pray for the 
grieving families who have loved and 
lost. They have lost someone they were 
very close to, someone they cared 
about, someone who brought joy to 
their lives, someone whom they will 
miss. 
I am reminded again of the great 
song by Bruce Springsteen, ‘‘You’re 
Missing.’’ He wrote it after 9/11, and it 
has application, of course, to all kinds 
of circumstances where someone lost a 
loved one—lost a loved one in 9/11, lost 
a loved one in Iraq or Afghanistan or in 
so many other tragedies. In this case, I 
will use it to talk about what these 
families have lost because of this ter-
rible virus and the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I won’t recite, of course, all the lyrics, 
but Bruce Springsteen, in the song 
‘‘You’re Missing’’ has a refrain: 
You’re missing when I shut out the lights 
You’re missing when I close my eyes 
You’re missing when I see the sun rise 
He goes on to sing the rest of the 
song about a person missing. 
All of these families will miss their 
loved ones, not only when they are 
shutting off the lights and when they 
rise in the morning but every day and, 
in many cases, every hour of every day. 
So we pray for them. 
And I think we have an obligation 
ourselves to these families. To honor 
those we have lost, we must all do our 
part. 
What does that mean? It means fol-
lowing public health guidance regard-
ing social distancing, wearing masks, 
and other steps we can all take, each of 
us, to reduce the spread of COVID–19 
and to save as many lives as possible 
until the vaccines are widely available. 
Let’s do what we can. Of course, we 
should express condolences and sym-
pathy. Of course, we should pray for an 
end to this terrible scourge. But we all 
have an obligation to do more to get 
those death numbers down. 
But I wanted, in some small way, to 
recognize these Pennsylvanians, rep-
resentative of all 12,890, which we pray 
will not grow very much from that 
number, just to say a word about the 
lives they lived and the families they 
left behind. 
May God bless all of them. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

CHINA 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise be-
cause in a few minutes, I am going to 
ask to enter into the RECORD a new re-
port released last night by Adrian Zenz 
of the Victims of Communism Memo-
rial Foundation. It isn’t often that we 
enter into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
reports that are really things that we 
want our constituents to read, but this 
report is different. This report is a re-
port that every American needs to 
know about because it makes clear two 
things. 
First, it makes clear that cotton 
from Xinjiang, which is about 20 per-
cent of all the world’s cotton; it is 
about 85 percent of all the cotton com-
ing out of China, but it is about 20 per-
cent of the global cotton, and it is a lot 
of the best cotton on the globe—is 
stained by slave labor. 
The second thing that it makes clear 
is that a lot of this cotton is destined 
for the United States. We are the ones 
demanding it, and our people are mak-
ing a market for this blood cotton. 
Under the guise of Orwellian terms 
like ‘‘poverty alleviation,’’ the Chinese 
Communist Party is forcibly mobi-
lizing minority labor—the Uighurs—to 
replace the majority Han Chinese labor 
market that has traditionally picked 
some of the Xinjiang cotton. Very 
young and very elderly folks are often 
sent into facilities, and everyone in be-
tween—everybody who has a body that 
can move into the fields—is being sent 
into 
these 
cotton 
fields 
for 
the 
monthslong cotton picking season. 
Picking 
cotton 
is 
backbreaking 
labor, and these Uighurs who are being 
forced to do this as slaves are under 
constant surveillance. They are sub-
jected to very long work hours, and 
they are forced to participate in polit-
ical indoctrination sessions. Some of 
today’s pickers have also done shifts 
and turns in CCP internment camps as 
well. 
We should be very clear about what 
is happening here. What is happening 
here is an unmitigated evil. There isn’t 
another interpretation for this slave 
labor that is producing the Xinjiang 
blood cotton. This is an unmitigated 
evil, and it is obviously far more com-
fortable to ignore evil than to confront 
it head-on. Despite our many promises, 
it is easy to forget the human toil of 
totalitarianism. It is easier to just 
look away. 
That is, of course, what the Com-
munist leadership in Beijing is count-
ing on. They are counting on the fact 
that U.S. citizens and corporate leader-
ship and politicians will just be busy 
and will say: Well, that would be messy 
to have to confront, so we should just 
look away. We said we would never for-
get, but let’s just not notice. 
So we should state this truth over 
and over and over again. Chairman Xi’s 
dictatorship is enslaving more than 
half a million Uighurs, and they are 
being forced to pick blood cotton. That 
is what this report from the Victims of 
Communism Memorial Foundation last 
night clearly demonstrates. 
The Chinese Communist Party is 
convinced that the American people 
and that the institutions of the U.S. 
Government will simply look away, so 
we need to say again and again that 
Chairman Xi’s dictatorship is enslaving 
more than half a million Uighurs. They 
are being forced into slavery in the cot-
ton fields. Much of that cotton is des-
tined for U.S. markets, and Chairman 
Xi and his underlings are counting on 
the fact that although America raises a 
light of liberty in our rhetoric, they 
are expecting that we will just look 
away in practice and in fact in our 
marketplaces. We should not and we 
cannot give them that victory. 
Beijing’s Communist Party doesn’t 
care about basic human dignity. The 
genocidal leaders who are running the 
government in Beijing—and, again, we 
need to distinguish that. Every time 
we talk about topics like this, we need 
to distinguish between the leadership 
of the Communist Party in Beijing and 
the regular 1.4 billion Chinese citizens, 
many of whom have nothing to do with 
these evils and wouldn’t countenance 
them if they had the power. The geno-
cidal leadership of the Communist 
Party in Beijing is running systemati-
cally oppressive slave regimes against 
the Muslims and against other ethnic 
minorities. 
Their cruelty is unmatched. They are 
ripping families apart. They are forc-
ibly separating children from parents. 
They forcibly separate husbands and 
wives. They send goons in to rape the 
wives whose husbands have been sent 
away, hoping that they can impregnate 
them with other ethnic children to sort 
of extinguish the Uighur population in 
this region. They are brainwashing 
children, and they have weaponized 
forced abortion and sterilization. They 
have 
systematically 
demolished 
mosques. 
What is happening in Xinjiang is not 
gray; what is happening in Xinjiang is 
evil. Chairman Xi’s underlings do not 
believe that the Uighurs are human,

December 15, 2020 
and the racist Communist Party in 
Beijing believes that these men and 
women are little better than animals 
and that they can be exploited as 
slaves. In Xinjiang, cotton is king. 
How does Beijing try to explain this 
away? Well, of course, there are a 
whole bunch of lies that they try to use 
to cover it up. According to their prop-
aganda, the Uighurs and other ethnic 
minorities are lazy people, and they 
need help to overcome their laziness. 
They need to learn about work, and 
they need to be helped out of poverty. 
These are the sorts of topline versions 
of their disgusting lies. But they don’t 
really think that anybody is persuaded 
by these lies. What they expect is that 
the money will do the persuading for 
them. They don’t think that these lies 
are ruled out in a way that is going to 
really be compelling to anyone. What 
they really expect is that we won’t pay 
attention to where high-quality, cheap 
cotton often comes from and that we 
will just look away. 
And here is the painful truth: The 
global supply chains that have bene-
fited from this blood cotton have got-
ten some really good cotton at really 
cheap prices. In 2019, an estimated 70 
percent of Xinjiang’s cotton was picked 
by hand, making it some of the highest 
quality cotton in the world and some of 
the most desirable cotton in any mar-
ketplace, and it is incredibly cheap be-
cause it is picked by slave labor. 
Xinjiang produces about 85 percent of 
China’s cotton and about 20 percent of 
the world’s cotton, and it is impossible 
to separate blood cotton from the 
small minority that is not picked in 
these slave fields. 
Here is what it means in America and 
around the world: It means that we are 
living in a sea of hypocrisy because we 
have a whole bunch of U.S. companies 
that celebrate individuality, individ-
ualism, make some unbelievably good 
commercials and talk about the expan-
sion of human potential, at the same 
time being cosponsors of slave fields. 
That is what we are talking about 
here. We can’t and we shouldn’t simply 
look away. 
The extensiveness of the CCP’s forced 
labor programs are such that many 
U.S. companies, including at least 82 
identifiable global brands, have bene-
fited from the Xinjiang slave cotton 
labor. Gap and Nike are two of the 
companies that are most obviously sin-
gled out, and the CCP has helped them 
cut their costs and expand their mar-
ket access. In exchange, what they ask 
for is a really polite ‘‘see no evil’’ pol-
icy. 
The commercials that are aired in 
prime time at major sporting events in 
the United States are aired by compa-
nies that at the same time say: Please 
don’t ask us about our supply chains. 
We don’t want to have to give any ac-
count for that. 
These companies spend billions of 
dollars a year running ad campaigns 
touting values like self-determination. 
Yet they are quietly importing Com-
munist values, particularly about the 
lack of human dignity. We don’t want 
those values imported into the United 
States. We don’t want to look away. 
We don’t want to be people who say 
‘‘Never again and never forget’’ and 
then just casually say ‘‘I am never 
going to notice.’’ We don’t want to be 
those people. 
Today, I have written letters to both 
Gap and Nike asking them to help— 
asking them to please help make trans-
parent to the American people what 
they know about their supply chains 
and how we should clean them up. We 
need to tackle the problem of this 
blood cotton from Xinjiang, and we 
need to give the American public, the 
American 
consumer, 
a 
transparent 
look into what these supply chains 
look like, where they come from, and 
how much blood they are tainted with. 
In the coming weeks, I and others 
will be reaching out to more companies 
than Gap and Nike, but those are the 
two letters I sent today. Americans in 
government and business and even 
Americans as we go to the store with 
our wallets as consumers in the retail 
marketplace—we need to be aware of 
what is happening. We need to be a peo-
ple who believe in defending human 
rights. 
The unjust status quo is very profit-
able, so many companies are now fight-
ing this change. They are fighting this 
transparency. As attention in Congress 
has turned towards supply chain integ-
rity concerns in recent months, compa-
nies have begun to deploy high-paid 
lobbyists on Capitol Hill. Americans 
who believe strongly in human rights 
and fundamental freedoms have been 
justifiably confused about these efforts 
to weaken legislation that seeks to ban 
imported goods that are made with 
Chinese Communist Party slave labor. 
Businesses that claim a fundamental 
respect for human dignity ought to 
share with their consumers and with 
their shareholders how they ensure the 
integrity of their supply chains be-
cause, again, 20 percent of the world’s 
cotton comes from this part of China, 
and 85 percent of that cotton looks like 
it is tainted by blood cotton. 
Companies need to come clean if they 
have been asked by the CCP to stay si-
lent about the human rights abuses in 
China. Companies need to reevaluate 
the costs and the benefits, and the 
costs are high of partnering with the 
genocidal regime. They need to do it 
themselves. These companies need to 
do it themselves because it is right, 
and they need to be pushed to do it be-
cause it is hard and because the com-
petitive marketplace has many of their 
peer companies and competitor compa-
nies also benefiting from this same 
slave cotton. 
The U.S. Congress has become in-
creasingly concerned about the Chinese 
Communist Party’s pay-to-play shake-
down of American companies. There is 
currently a bill under consideration in 
this body that forces a long overdue re-
view of supply chains, and there are 
going to be many more bills and pieces 
of legislation like this coming. Compa-
nies, even if they don’t want to do it 
for the right reason, should do it for 
the pragmatic reason of getting in 
front of this because this attention is 
not going to go away. The concern in 
this body and in this Congress about 
the blood in the slave supply chains in 
many of these industries is bipartisan. 
The United States celebrates the 
ideals of universal human dignity. The 
Chinese Communist Party explicitly 
rejects these ideals. In this ideological 
competition, Beijing is working to ex-
ploit something—they are working to 
exploit the moral concessions of Amer-
ican CEOs. CEOs and boards, you need 
to do better. American consumers, you 
need to ask hard questions. And this 
Congress needs to do some serious in-
vestigating. 
American and global companies that 
find their roots in these freedom-loving 
worlds and countries and that express 
public support for fundamental human 
freedoms that produce their success 
must act now. There is more to do than 
maximize the bottom line. That is not 
the only value. And the Senate is in-
creasingly willing to act to ensure that 
American companies do not import 
misguided Chinese Communist Party 
values to these shores. 
Right now, it is too easy, it is too 
comfortable, and it is too profitable for 
many American and global companies 
to simply ignore the evil. We need to 
make the suffering in Xinjiang known. 
We need to speak about the Uighurs. 
These men, women, and children have 
God-given dignity, and we should not 
look away. 
Americans need to know about this 
evil so that we can, together, confront 
it. We need to dismantle Chairman Xi’s 
lies, and we need to make it uncon-
scionable for American businesses to 
profit from Chairman Xi’s injustices. 
Mr. President, the report from the 
Victims 
in 
Communism 
Memorial 
Foundation released last night about 
the blood slave labor in Xinjiang can be

TRIBUTE TO PAT ROBERTS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. Senator 
PAT ROBERTS has dedicated his life to 
serving the Nation and the people of 
his home State of Kansas, and I would 
like to take a moment to recognize his 
retirement. 
During his 40 years of service in the 
U.S. Congress, Senator ROBERTS has 
become a leader on agriculture, rural 
health and education, and defense pol-
icy. Senator ROBERTS is the first Mem-
ber of Congress to chair the Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry Com-
mittee in both the Senate and the 
House of Representatives. Through his 
work on this committee and other, and 
across Congress, Senator ROBERTS has 
served with honor and distinction, 
keeping foremost in mind the interests 
and needs of Kansans. 
PAT has been a true partner on the 
Agriculture Committee. His method-
ical approach to bipartisanship mirrors 
my own efforts when I served a chair-
man of that committee and worked 
with Senator Dick Lugar to write and 
advance farm bills, nutrition laws, and 
conservation 
policies. 
Under 
PAT’s 
chairmanship, the committee was able 
to reach a compromise on the 2018 farm 
bill, allowing for the inclusion of sev-
eral key policies to enhance rural de-
velopment, support our farmers, and 
fund vital nutrition programs. I know 
from negotiating the 1990 farm bill as 
committee chairman that reaching a 
bipartisan and bicameral consensus on 
such a substantial and sweeping piece 
of legislation is no simple task. PAT’s 
leadership through the process showed 
his deep commitment to providing for 
the American people. 
PAT and I have worked together, and 
we have traveled together. We often 
chuckle that there are two bald men 
named PAT
serving in the Senate. 
While I will miss sharing that chuckle 
with my friend, I will miss more his 
partnership and unwavering commit-
ment to advancing responsible policies 
and practices to support agricultural 
sectors across the country. PAT and his 
wife 
Franki 
have 
become 
friends. 
Marcelle and I wish them the very best. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO CORY GARDNER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, CORY 
GARDNER may be one of the younger 
members of the Senate, but he has 
brought distinction and dedication to 
his work on behalf of Coloradans. His 
entire career has been anchored in leg-
islative work, at the Federal and State 
levels, first as a Senate staffer and 
then in the Colorado House of Rep-
resentatives, before his election to 
serve in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives. 
In both the State legislature and in 
the House of Representatives, he fo-
cused primarily on energy and agri-
culture legislation. He brought these 
priorities with him to Senate in 2015, 
through his work on the Senate Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee and 
Commerce, Justice, and Science Com-
mittees. As a Senator, Senator GARD-
NER has often worked across the aisle 
to find common ground and deliver for 
the people of the United States. One re-
cent example was the enactment of the 
bipartisan Great American Outdoors 
Act, which became law in August. This 
landmark bipartisan conservation leg-
islation permanently funds the Land 
and Water Conservation Fund, supports 
and creates countless jobs in conserva-
tion and outdoor recreation, and pro-
tects our country’s natural beauty. 
Through the negotiation and passage of 
this bill, Senator GARDNER was at the 
table, trying to reach consensus and 
bring about meaningful benefits for the 
American people. That is no easy task 
and one which is not undertaken often 
in the Senate these days. 
Senator GARDNER will leave the Sen-
ate at the end of this Congress, but I 
know his dedication to public service 
will remain. Marcelle and I wish Sen-
ator GARDNER, his wife Alyson, and the 
rest of their family the very best in the 
next chapter of their lives. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DOUG JONES 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as a na-
tion, today we find ourselves contem-
plating the key tenets upon which our 
country was founded: the importance 
of truth and equality, the pursuit of 
justice, and the determination of what 
is right. DOUG JONES has pursued jus-
tice and has fought for equality and for 
what is right for his entire career. 
DOUG is one of the most dedicated, 
thoughtful and decent public servants I 
have ever had the privilege to know 
and work with in my time in the Sen-
ate. He leaves the Senate having only 
furthered that record of public service. 
DOUG brought with him to the Senate 
a passion for civil rights and for resolv-
ing prior injustices. As U.S. attorney 
for the Northern District of Alabama, 
he fought against entrenched racial in-
justice. He prosecuted the men respon-
sible for the 1963 bombing of the 16th 
Street Baptist Church: and indicted do-
mestic terrorist Eric Rudolph. In the 
Senate, he continued the pursuit of jus-
tice as a vocal advocate for greater 
government transparency and authored 
legislation that has expanded access to 
criminal investigation records for civil 
rights cases, helping families and indi-
viduals to resolve injustices after dec-
ades of inaction. 
I am certain that, even as he leaves 
the Senate, DOUG will continue to rep-
resent and to fight for what is right. 
His has been an important and unique-
ly qualified voice for justice voice in 
the Senate these last few years, and I 
will miss his sound judgment and 
thoughtful advocacy. I know his long 
record of public service will only con-
tinue. Marcelle and I wish DOUG and 
his wife Louise and their entire family 
all the best. 
I have great respect for him. He is 
one of the most impressive Senators I 
have served with, and I am so proud of 
all he has accomplished. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MARTHA MCSALLY 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, although 
MARTHA MCSALLY only joined the Sen-
ate in 2019, she has spent decades serv-
ing the Nation and the people of the 
State of Arizona. 
She served for decades as a fighter 
pilot in the U.S. Air Force, in service 
to our country and to keep Americans 
safe. Upon her retirement as colonel 
from the Air Force, she continued her 
career as a public servant by rep-
resenting Arizona’s Second Congres-
sional District in the U.S. House of 
Representatives for 4 years before her 
appointment to the Senate. 
In the Senate, as she did in the 
House, Senator MCSALLY has fought 
hard to support veterans and has 
worked to further the interests of Ari-
zonans. Her sense of duty to her coun-
try and to her State allowed her to 
make important contributions to the 
Senate Armed Services and Senate En-
ergy and Natural Resources Commit-
tees. 
Senator MCSALLY has also been a 
‘‘neighbor,’’ with our offices both on 
same floor of the Russell Senate Build-
ing. I thank Senator MCSALLY for her 
service in the Senate, and I wish her 
the best in the next chapter of her life. 
(At the request of Mr. THUNE, the fol-
lowing statement was ordered to be 
printed in the RECORD.)

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Italy—Gulfstream G550 Aircraft with Air-
borne Intelligence, Surveillance, Recon-
naissance, 
and 
Electronic 
Warfare 
(AISREW) Mission Systems 
The Government of Italy has requested to 
buy articles and services to support the inte-
gration of two (2) Airborne Intelligence, Sur-
veillance, Reconnaissance, and Electronic 
Warfare (AISREW) mission systems onto two 
(2) Italian Ministry of Defense provided G550 
aircraft consisting of: four (4) Multifunc-
tional Information Distribution Systems— 
Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) (2 
installed, 2 spares); three (3) Embedded/GPS/ 
INS (EGI) with GPS security devices, air-
borne (2 installed, 1 spare); and four (4) 
RIOTM Communications Intelligence Systems 
(2 installed, 2 spares). Also included are Mis-
sile Warning Sensors, AN/ALE–47 Counter-
measure Dispenser Sets (CMDS), MX–20HD 
Electro-Optical and InfraRed systems, Os-
prey 50 AESA Radars, AISREW ISR equip-
ment, Secure Communications equipment, 
Identification Friend or Foe Systems, air-
craft modification and integration, ground 
systems for data processing and crew train-
ing, ground support equipment, publications 
and technical data, US Government and con-
tractor engineering, technical and logistics 
support services, flight test and certifi-
cation, 
and 
other 
related 
elements 
of 
logistical and program support. The total es-
timated program cost is $500 million. 
This proposed sale will support U.S. for-
eign policy and national security by helping 
to improve the security of a NATO ally, 
which is an important partner for political 
stability and economic progress in Europe. 
The proposed sale supports and com-
plements the ongoing efforts of Italy to mod-
ernize its airborne Intelligence, Surveil-
lance, Reconnaissance, and Electronic War-
fare capability and increases interoper-
ability between the U.S. Air Force and the 
Italian Air Force (ITAF). Italy will have no 
difficulty absorbing these articles into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be L3Harris, 
Greenville, TX. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of up to six (6) addi-
tional U.S. contractor representatives to 
Italy for a duration of one (1) year to support 
equipment familiarization. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness resulting from this proposed 
sale.

Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. Missile Warning Sensor (MWS) units are 
mounted on the aircraft exterior to provide 
omni-directional protection. The MWS warns 
of threat missile approach by detecting radi-
ation associated with the rocket motor. The 
Infrared Missile Warning System (IRMWS) is 
a small, lightweight, passive, electro-optic, 
threat-warning device used to detect surface- 
to-air missiles fired at helicopters and low- 
flying fixed-wing aircraft and automatically 
provides counter-measures, as well as audio 
and visual warning messages to the aircrew. 
2. Multifunctional Information Distribu-
tion System-Joint Tactical Radio System 
(MIDS JTRS) is an advanced Link–16 com-
mand, control, communications, and intel-
ligence (C3I) system incorporating high ca-
pacity, jam-resistant, digital communication 
links for exchange of near real-time tactical 
information, including both data and voice, 
among air, ground, and sea elements. 
3. The AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
penser Set (CMDS) provides an integrated 
threat-adaptive, computer controlled capa-
bility for dispensing chaff, flares, and active 
radio frequency expendables. The system is 
internally mounted and may be operated as 
a standalone system or may be integrated 
with other on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) 
and avionics systems. The AN/ALE–47 uses 
threat data received over the aircraft inter-
faces to assess the threat situation and de-
termine a response. Expendable routines tai-
lored to the immediate aircraft and threat 
environment may be dispensed using one of 
four operational modes. 
4. The Embedded GPS–INS (EGI) is a sen-
sor that combines GPS and inertial sensor 
inputs to provide accurate location informa-
tion for navigation and targeting, and can be 
loaded with crypto-variable keys. 
5. Wescam MX–20HD is a gyro-stabilized, 
multi-spectral, multi-field of view Electro- 
Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) system. The systems 
provide surveillance laser illumination and 
laser designation through use of an exter-
nally mounted turret sensor unit and inter-
nally mounted master control. Sensor video 
imagery is displayed in the aircraft real time 
and may be recorded for subsequent ground 
analysis. 
6. The Osprey family of surveillance radars 
provides second generation Active Electroni-
cally Scanned Array (AESA) surveillance ca-
pability as the primary sensor on airborne 
assets. The Osprey radars are at a high tech-
nology readiness level and are in production 
for fixed and rotary wing applications. This 
Osprey configuration employs a side-looking 
radar. Osprey radars provide a genuine 
multi-domain capability, with high perform-
ance sea surveillance, notably against dif-
ficult targets, land surveillance with wide 
swath, very high resolution ground mapping, 
small and low speed ground target indica-
tion, high performance air to air surveil-
lance, tracking and intercept. 
7. The AISREW mission systems, to in-
clude the RIOTM
Communications Intel-
ligence Systems, provide near-real-time in-
formation to tactical forces, combatant com-
manders 
and 
national-level 
authorities

across the spectrum of conflict. The mission 
system can forward gather information in a 
variety of formats via secured communica-
tions systems. Most hardware used in this 
system is generic and commercially avail-
able. However, if any of the specialized hard-
ware or publications are lost, the informa-
tion could provide insight into many critical 
U.S. capabilities. Information gained could 
be used to develop countermeasures as well 
as offensive and defensive counter-tactics. 
8. The highest level of classification of in-
formation included in this potential sale is 
SECRET. 
9. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
10. A determination has been made that 
Italy can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
11. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to Italy. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased that we’ve finally agreed on 
language to enhance penalties for fe-
male genital mutilation, or FGM, a 
truly horrible practice. I thank my col-
leagues in the House who worked with 
me on this issue. 
More than 200 million women and 
girls alive today in 30 countries in Afri-
ca, the Middle East, Asia, and the 
United States have fallen victim to 
this monstrous practice. Researchers 
estimate more than 500,000 women and 
girls in the U.S. have experienced or 
are at risk of falling victim to FGM. 
I introduced legislation on this sub-
ject earlier this year, and, although the 
final language adopted by the House in 
H.R. 6100 doesn’t include the protec-
tions I championed in a legally precise 
manner, it will send a strong message 
that Congress condemns the violent 
and disgusting butchery of young girls 
and women in this country. 
Federal law bans the practice of 
FGM. However, in 2018, a district judge 
in Michigan found unconstitutional 
under Commerce Clause grounds the 
Federal statute banning FGM. Rather 
than appeal, the Department of Jus-
tice’s Solicitor General wrote a letter 
asking Congress to amend the law to 
address the constitutional problem. I 
ask unanimous consent that this letter 
be printed in the RECORD following my 
remarks. 
The bill I introduced in response to 
this request, S. 2017, the Federal Prohi-
bition of Female Genital Mutilation 
Act of 2019, fixes the constitutional de-
fects by adding specific commerce 
clause-focused language to the current 
law. It is a straightforward change that 
would make the existing statute con-
sistent with Supreme Court precedent. 
The House version of my bill will go 
a long way in protecting women and 
girls from FGM, but I remain con-
vinced Congress can and should go even 
further to prevent this barbarity. Be-
cause H.R. 6100 only criminalizes FGM 
acts committed for nonmedical rea-
sons, it creates a loophole in the form 
of a medical benefits defense. Criminal 
defendants could leverage this defense 
against their victims by claiming they 
performed FGM to prevent infections, 
inflammation, or sexually transmitted 
diseases, all common excuses in coun-
tries where FGM is widespread. Unlike 
the old law, the burden is now on the 
government to prove the act was not 
done for medical reasons. Previously, it 
was the defendant’s burden to prove 
the act was not medically necessary, 
per 18 U.S.C. 116(b). 
While medical issues are commonly 
contested in FGM cases, the addition of 
a new element for the government to 
prove as part of its case-in-chief makes 
it tougher to prosecute perpetrators. 
Furthermore, section 5 of H.R. 6100 
declares that the Michigan district 
court decision on interstate commerce 
is erroneous. That language squarely 
conflicts with the Solicitor General’s 
letter to Congress, which asserts the 
exact opposite. 
A fix-it law should make a defective 
law better, not introduce new problems 
or make it easier for defendants to es-
cape accountability. I am disappointed 
that these concerns were not addressed 
early on in the legislative drafting 
process, but I am also optimistic that 
we will resolve them in a future Con-
gress. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 
OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERAL, 
Washington, DC, April 10, 2019. 
Re United States v. Jumana Nagarwala et al., 
No. 17–cr–20274 (E.D. Mich. Nov. 20, 2018) 
Hon. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, 
Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR FEINSTEIN: Consistent with 
28 U.S.C. 530D, I write to call your attention 
to the above-referenced decision of the 
United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of Michigan. A copy of the decision 
is attached. 
This case is the first federal prosecution 
under 18 U.S.C. 116(a), which prohibits female 
genital mutilation (FGM). Section 116(a) 
makes it a criminal offense to ‘‘knowingly 
circumcise[ ], excise[ ], or infibulate[ ] the 
whole or any part of the labia majora or 
labia minora or clitoris of another person 
who has not attained the age of 18 years.’’ 
Ibid. The district court dismissed the FGM 
charges, holding that Section 116(a) is be-
yond Congress’s power. First, the court con-
cluded that Section 116(a) is not necessary 
and proper to effectuate an international 
treaty under Missouri v. Holland, 252 U.S. 416 
(1920). The court rejected the government’s 
argument that the provision was rationally 
related to implementing the United States’ 
obligations under the International Cov-
enant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 
done, Dec. 19, 1966, 999 U.N.T.S. 171, 6 I.L.M. 
368. Second, the court relied on United States 
v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), and United States 
v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000), to hold that 
Section 116(a) was beyond Congress’s power 
under the Commerce Clause. The court found 
that FGM was not an economic activity but 
was instead a form of physical assault, and 
that the statute adding Section 116(a) to the 
U.S. Code was unaccompanied by detailed, 
record-based findings from which a court 
could determine that FGM substantially af-
fects interstate commerce. The court further 
emphasized that, unlike many federal crimi-
nal statutes, Section 116(a) does not include 
any jurisdictional elements, such as a re-
quirement that the charged offense have an 
explicit connection with, or effect on, inter-
state commerce. 
Section 116(a) targets an especially heinous 
practice—permanently 
mutilating 
young 
girls—that should be universally condemned. 
FGM is a form of gender-based violence and 
child abuse that harms victims not only 
when they are girls, suffering the immediate 
trauma of the act, but also throughout their 
lives as women, when it often results in a 
range of physical and psychological harms. 
See Act of Sept. 30, 1996, Pub. L. 104–208, Div. 
C., Tit. VI, § 644(a), 110 Stat. 3009–708 (18 
U.S.C. 116 note). The Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimates that half a 
million women and girls in the United States 
have already suffered FGM or are at risk for 
being subjected to FGM in the future. See 
Howard Goldberg et al., Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, Female Genital Mu-
tilation/Cutting in the United States, 131 
Public Health Reports 340 (2016). The Depart-
ment therefore condemns this practice in the 
strongest possible terms. 
That said, the Department has reluctantly 
determined that—particularly in light of the 
Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison, which 
was decided after Section 116(a)’s enact-
ment—it lacks a reasonable defense of the 
provision, as currently worded, and will not 
pursue an appeal of the district court’s deci-
sion. Instead, we urge that Congress act 
forthwith to address the constitutional prob-
lem, by promptly enacting the attached leg-
islative proposal, which, in our view, would 
clearly establish Congress’s authority to 
criminalize FGM of minors and ensure that 
this practice is prohibited by federal law. 
First, the Department has determined that 
it lacks an adequate argument that Section 
116(a), as it is currently written, is necessary 
and proper to the regulation of interstate 
commerce. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
Commerce 
Clause, Congress can regulate and protect 
the channels of interstate commerce, the in-
strumentalities of interstate commerce, and 
activities that ‘‘substantially affect inter-
state commerce.’’ Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 
1, 17 (2005). Unlike many federal criminal 
statutes, however, Section 116(a) does not re-
quire proof of any nexus between the conduct 
at issue (performing FGM on minors) and 
interstate 
commerce—the 
critical 
defect 
found by the Supreme Court in Morrison and 
Lopez. Furthermore, although FGM can be 
performed in circumstances with commercial 
characteristics, FGM itself does not appear 
to be inherently an economic activity, and 
when performed purely locally, FGM does 
not appear to be ‘‘part of an economic ‘class 
of activities’ that have a substantial effect 
on interstate commerce.’’ Ibid. 
Second, the Department has determined 
that it does not have an adequate argument 
that Section 116(a) is within Congress’s au-
thority to enact legislation to implement 
the ICCPR, which does not address FGM. 
None of the ICCPR’s provisions references 
FGM at all. Nor do they provide a basis for 
the federal government itself (rather than 
the individual States) to criminalize FGM of 
minors by private parties. This case is there-
fore not analogous to Holland, which in-
volved a treaty that more directly addressed 
the parties’ obligation to protect certain mi-
gratory birds and to propose legislation to do 
so. See 252 U.S. at 431. Thus, even maintain-
ing the full continuing validity of Holland, 
the Department does not believe it can de-
fend Section 116(a) on this ground.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7498 
December 15, 2020 
Although the Department has determined 
not to appeal the district court’s decision, it 
recognizes the severity of the charged con-
duct, its lifelong impact on victims, and the 
importance of a federal prohibition on FGM 
committed on minors. Accordingly, the De-
partment urges Congress to amend Section 
116(a) to address the constitutional issue 
that formed the basis of the district court’s 
opinion in this case. Specifically, concur-
rently with submitting this letter, the De-
partment is submitting to Congress a legisla-
tive proposal that would amend Section 
116(a) to provide that FGM is a federal crime 
when (1) the defendant or victim travels in 
or uses a channel or instrumentality of 
interstate or foreign commerce in further-
ance of the FGM; (2) the defendant uses a 
means, channel, facility, or instrumentality 
of interstate commerce in connection with 
the FGM; (3) a payment is made in or affect-
ing interstate or foreign commerce in fur-
therance of the FGM; (4) an offer or other 
communication is made in or affecting inter-
state or foreign commerce in furtherance of 
the FGM; (5) the conduct occurs within the 
United States’ special maritime and terri-
torial jurisdiction, or within the District of 
Columbia or a U.S. territory; or (6) the FGM 
otherwise occurs in or affects interstate or 
foreign commerce. In our view, adding these 
provisions would ensure that, in every pros-
ecution under the statute, there is a nexus to 
interstate commerce. 
Please let me know if we can be of further 
assistance in this matter. 
Sincerely, 
NOEL J. FRANCISCO, 
Solicitor General.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES AIR FORCE 389TH FIGHT-
ER SQUADRON 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the U.S. 
Air Force’s 389th Fighter Squadron— 
known, respected, and feared around 
the globe as the Thunderbolts—flew 
downrange from the 366th Fighter Wing 
at Mountain Home Air Force Base in 
Idaho to support Operations Inherent 
Resolve and Spartan Shield from Octo-
ber 2019 until June 2020. Led by Lt. Col. 
Rod ‘‘Brick’’ James, the squadron of F– 
15E Strike Eagles deployed to the 
United States Central Command area 
of responsibility for the fight against 
the Islamic State. 
During its historic combat deploy-
ment, the T-Bolts employed 263 muni-
tions of myriad types during over 2,600 
sorties and a record 13,000 combat 
hours throughout CENTCOM. Dem-
onstrating the rapid, agile, and lethal 
characteristics of airpower, the 389th 
executed close air support for troops in 
Syria and Iraq. In addition to CAS, the 
Squadron Weapons section loaded the 
first Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Mis-
sile, AGM–158, expended in combat by 
the 366th Fighter Wing, for just one of 
a host of special missions. All the while 
a deterrent, the T-Bolts stood ready to 
defeat Iranian aggression if the call 
came. Finally, they stayed in the fight 
50 percent longer than planned to en-
sure COVID–19 did not cause any loss of 
support to those who needed Strike Ea-
gles overhead. 
Throughout their deployment, the 
men and women of the 389th Fighter 
Squadron and Aircraft Maintenance 
Unit performed exceptionally under in-
tense combat pressures executing a 
new, highly mobile deployment con-
struct during a pandemic. The Thun-
derbolts represent the best America 
has to offer. They ride hard, shoot 
straight, and always speak the truth. I 
join all grateful Americans in con-
gratulating this outstanding team on a 
job well done. Banzai.

TRIBUTE TO MARK LEDUC 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor a member of my staff, Mark 
LeDuc, who will soon retire after dec-
ades of distinguished service. Mark ex-
emplifies the ideal public servant, dem-
onstrating integrity, thoroughness, a 
spirit of inquiry, and hard work in 
every undertaking. Above all, Mark 
has always demonstrated his belief 
that it is an honor to serve the people 
of Maine and our Nation. 
Mark was born in New Jersey, but his 
father’s final tour of duty in the U.S. 
Navy brought the family to Maine, 
where they were finally home. I first 
met Mark in 1986 at a campaign event 
for then-Representative John McKer-
nan, who was running for Governor of 
the State of Maine. He had recently 
graduated from a joint degree program 
at Columbia Law School and the 
School of Public and International Af-
fairs at Princeton University. He had 
just moved back to Maine with his wife 
Marie, whom he had met while they 
were both studying at Princeton. 
Mark and I both went on to work in 
the Governor McKernan’s administra-
tion. Mark served as head of the Gov-
ernor’s legislative staff, and I was com-
missioner of professional and financial 
regulation in his cabinet. At the time, 
Maine’s workers compensation market 
was in the midst of a crisis, leading to 
a 17-day State government shutdown. 
Mark and I worked closely together on 
the reform legislation that ended the 
shutdown and successfully resolved the 
crisis. 
Mark held other roles in State gov-
ernment, but it was during his service 
in the Governor’s office that I first saw 
and came to appreciate his ability to 
master complex issues and his dedica-
tion to public service. 
Mark joined my Senate staff in 2003. 
He has served in various roles since 
that time, first in my personal office, 
then on my Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee staff, 
and now as chief counsel on my Aging 
Committee staff. Through the years, 
Mark has advised me with expertise 
and thoroughness on a wide range of 
issues. He served as my lead economic 
staffer on such legislation as the 2003 
tax cuts, the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief 
Program, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act, the Dodd-Frank fi-
nancial regulatory reform legislation, 
and 
the 
Collins 
capital 
standards 
amendment. He also advised me on the 
economics of the 2010 Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act and later 
put his knowledge of State insurance 
regulation to work when he helped me 
to draft the Lower Premiums Through 
Reinsurance Act. 
Mark’s most significant professional 
accomplishment may very well be the 
Paycheck Protection Program that he 
helped me craft earlier this year. Dur-
ing the devastating COVID–19 pan-
demic, this program has helped to sus-
tain more than 50 million American 
jobs, including more than 250,000 jobs 
in the State of Maine, and I so appre-
ciate the great knowledge and untiring 
energy he put into this crucial project. 
It was important, and it helped real 
people—the small business owners and 
their employees who are the backbone 
of communities across our Nation. 
Mark has achieved great professional 
success, but what he is most proud of is 
his family. Mark and Marie have three 
daughters: Miriam-Rose, Julie, and 
Karen. While I am delighted for him 
that in his retirement he will have 
more time to spend with the family he 
loves so dearly, his absence as a mem-
ber of my staff will be deeply felt. 
Mark is a true public servant. He per-
forms his work not for accolades but 
for a belief in helping people and doing 
what right. I wish him and his family 
all the best as they embark on this 
next chapter.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE GREAT PLAINS 
FOOD BANK 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, this has 
been a challenging year for millions of 
Americans impacted by the COVID–19 
pandemic. Many organizations have 
stepped up to assist with delivering 
food, and I want to recognize one North 
Dakota organization that continues to 
expand its services to partner with 
other local organizations reaching out 
to those in need. 
The Great Plains Food Bank has 
served communities in North Dakota 
since 1983, regularly dispatching trucks 
to all 53 counties across the State. 
With USDA estimates that 27 percent 
of all food produced in the United 
States never makes it to the dinner 
table, the Great Plains Food Bank’s 
mission is to get this surplus food from 
those who have it to those who need it. 
It has joined forces with hundreds of 
food industry partners to recover their 
surplus shelf-stable and perishable food 
products. These include local, regional 
and national growers, processors, man-
ufacturers, retailers, Federal and State 
government food programs, food drives, 
and Feeding America, the Nation’s food 
bank network. 
The Great Plains Food Bank took a 
significant step forward last month 
when it opened a second distribution 
center, this one in Bismarck, to better 
facilitate the delivery of food across 
western and central North Dakota, 
serving 100 soup kitchens, food pan-
tries, and shelters. This new warehouse 
now has room for freezers and refrig-
erators, office space and facilities for 
volunteers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7499 
December 15, 2020 
Opening the Bismarck distribution 
center is one of the goals of the food 
bank’s ‘‘Feed the Future’’ campaign, 
which has been raising funds since 2015 
and is also hoping to expand the Fargo 
headquarters and increase the total of 
meals it serves next year. This very 
timely 
expansion 
of 
food 
services 
across the State comes when more and 
more people are depending on these de-
liveries to feed themselves and their 
families. 
These services are possible because of 
a committed network of staff, volun-
teers, and corporate sponsors and part-
ners, who provide the funds and work-
force to continue the distribution 
every week throughout the year. 
In this holiday season during the end 
of a very difficult year, I congratulate 
the Great Plains Food Bank on its vi-
sion and ongoing success in delivering 
food across the State. On behalf of all 
North Dakotans, I thank all who work 
for and with the Great Plains Food 
Bank for their commitment to this 
cause. I wish them continued success 
and community support for years to 
come.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO PAUL J. WILDE 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Bonneville County 
Sheriff Paul Wilde and his more than 40 
years of service to his community. 
Sheriff Wilde began his career in law 
enforcement following the Teton Dam 
disaster in 1976 as a reserve deputy in 
Jefferson County. Within a year, he 
transferred to Bonneville County where 
he would remain for the next four dec-
ades. 
Community 
service 
is 
deeply 
engrained in Sheriff Wilde. Throughout 
his time as a deputy in the Bonneville 
County sheriff’s office, he also served 
on several boards and committees, in-
cluding as a founding board member of 
D.A.R.E., president of the 7th Judicial 
Court Appointed Special Advocates, 
and on the governing boards of Help, 
Inc., Domestic Violence Intervention, 
and Rape Crisis. In addition, he holds 
an Executive Certification from the 
Police Officers Standards a Training 
Academy and currently chairs the Jail 
Standards Committee for the Idaho 
Sheriffs Association. 
Through 
these 
opportunities, 
he 
learned that effective law enforcement 
requires a firm and daily commitment 
to community and personal sacrifice. 
Over the course of his career, Sheriff 
Wilde clearly demonstrated this com-
mitment. His colleagues were not the 
only people to recognize these qualities 
in Sheriff Wilde but also the residents 
of Bonneville County, who elected him 
to three consecutive terms as their 
sheriff. 
Sheriff Wilde leaves behind a legacy 
demonstrating the benefits of capable 
law enforcement, and we wish him and 
his wife Cindy the best as he transi-
tions back to private life. His leader-
ship and commitment to his commu-
nity will be missed, but his legacy will 
benefit Eastern Idaho for years to 
come.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO WARREN AND JANE 
ALLEN 
∑ Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize Warren and Jane 
Allen of Spofford, NH. The couple 
served our country with distinction 
during World War II, and the life they 
built together is emblematic of the 
many who came home from war, raised 
a family, and helped to build the Amer-
ica we know today. 
Warren, or ‘‘Bill’’ as he is known to 
close friends, was born on March 14, 
1923, in Calhoun, GA. He joined the U.S. 
Marine Corps in 1942. When asked years 
later why he decided to enlist, he re-
plied that he saw a movie about the 
Marines and liked the look of their 
dress blues. His service brought him 
across the country, from boot camp at 
Parris Island in South Carolina to 
‘‘tower school’’ in Fort Worth, TX, and 
eventually to a posting at Marine 
Corps Air Station Cherry Point in 
Havelock, NC. An air traffic controller, 
Bill remembers having to stand on or-
ange crates to direct aircraft traffic at 
MCAS Cherry Point. The control tower 
had not been built yet. 
Jane Post was born on April 26, 1923, 
in Spofford, NH. She enlisted in the re-
cently 
formed 
U.S. 
Marine 
Corps 
Women Reserves in June of 1943. She 
trained at Camp Lejeune in North 
Carolina and attended control tower 
school in Atlanta, GA. Following her 
training, she arrived at MCAS Cherry 
Point and was assigned to the air sta-
tion’s clearance center. It was her re-
sponsibility to keep track of all arriv-
ing and departing aircraft at the sta-
tion. It was at Cherry Point that 
Jane’s path crossed Bill’s in 1943. 
By November of that year, Bill had 
risen to a supervisor position at air 
station. One day, a plane carrying a 
U.S. Marine Corps general was descend-
ing and given clearance to land. Sud-
denly, a fighter pilot radioed that his 
plane was losing air pressure and re-
quested permission for an emergency 
landing. The control tower instructed 
the fighter pilot to circle the air sta-
tion and allow the general’s plane to 
land first. Upon hearing this, Bill 
sprinted up the stairs of the control 
tower and demanded to know who gave 
those instructions. It was Jane Post. 
Though he disagreed with her judge-
ment on which plane should have land-
ed first that day, Bill struck up a rela-
tionship with that control tower oper-
ator. They were married 5 months later 
on April 20, 1944, and have been insepa-
rable ever since. 
Bill continued to serve in the U.S. 
Marine Corps until 1946. He reenlisted 
in 1947 and kept his rank of technical 
sergeant. In 1952, he was honorably dis-
charged from the Reserves. Jane served 
in the Women Reserves until January 
12, 1945. She was honorably discharged 
upon the news that she and Bill were 
expecting their first child. 
The Allens eventually settled in 
Spofford, NH, a small community in 
the western part of the State. Bill went 
on to work at a number of local banks 
after a short stint as the owner of the 
local Tuttle’s Store. He retired as 
president of the Savings Bank of Wal-
pole in 1993. As their children grew up, 
Jane returned to school and obtained a 
bachelor’s degree in home economics 
from nearby Keene State College. 
They also applied the leadership 
qualities that they refined in the Ma-
rine Corps to a variety of community 
endeavors. Bill served as town moder-
ator and a longtime member of the 
local budget committee. He was also a 
captain at the Spofford Volunteer Fire 
Department. Jane worked to establish 
the Chesterfield Historical Society and 
was a driving force in raising funds for 
a new library in town. Bill and Jane 
were both fixtures at Keene State Col-
lege basketball games, Bill as an offi-
cial scorekeeper and Jane as a dedi-
cated fan. 
Last year, they celebrated their dia-
mond wedding anniversary among fam-
ily and the many friends they have 
made in their journey from Cherry 
Point to the Granite State. 
On behalf of the people of New Hamp-
shire, I ask my colleagues and all 
Americans to join me in thanking Bill 
and Jane Allen for their service in 
World War II and the many contribu-
tions they have made to their commu-
nity in the years since. We wish them 
all the best in the years ahead.∑

TRIBUTE TO DR. JOHN ANFINSON 
∑ Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a great advocate for the 
Mississippi River. After a distinguished 
career of public service at the Army 
Corps of Engineers and the National 
Park Service, Dr. John Anfinson will 
retire at the end of this month from his 
position as superintendent of Min-
nesota’s Mississippi National River and 
Recreation Area. 
During my time as a board member 
for Friends of the Mississippi River, I 
saw firsthand Dr. Anfinson’s tireless 
commitment to the river ecosystem. 
John has delighted in introducing peo-
ple to the mighty Mississippi as it 
flows through the twin cities of Min-
neapolis and Saint Paul and sharing 
stories about the historic, economic, 
and cultural significance of America’s 
great river. 
In each of his roles, from historian 
for the Saint Paul District of the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers to chief of re-
source 
management 
and 
super-
intendent of the Mississippi National 
River and Recreation Area of the Na-
tional Park Service, Dr. Anfinson has 
shared his love for the Mississippi with 
countless people in the Twin Cities and 
beyond. 
Dr. Anfinson has been a leader in pro-
tecting 
the 
river 
ecosystem 
from 
invasive species and has been instru-
mental in saving and repurposing the

which will soon come back to life as a 
new community, housing families and 
individuals. He and his work remind us 
of the cultural, commercial, and eco-
logical importance of the river. It is 
fundamental to our very identities as 
Minnesotans. 
Through his work, Dr. Anfinson has 
educated countless Minnesotans about 
the unique cultural heritage of the 
Mississippi, and he has inspired the 
public to appreciate and take advan-
tage of the treasures the river offers to 
our State and country. He has contrib-
uted to our understanding of the his-
tory of the river through his books, 
‘‘River of History’’ and ‘‘The River We 
Have Wrought.’’ His impact will be felt 
as 
generations 
and 
generations 
of 
Americans have the opportunity to 
learn about the Mississippi enjoy all 
that it has to offer. 
As our climate changes and our State 
changes in countless other ways, it is 
vital that we prioritize good steward-
ship of the river. That means cleaning 
the waters. That means maintaining 
our river communities and the infra-
structure—natural and manmade—nec-
essary to protect them from flooding. 
We will be challenged to constantly en-
vision, plan, and take action to make 
sure we have a Mississippi River wor-
thy of the legacy we want to pass on to 
the next generation of Minnesotans. 
Dr. Anfinson and his work will con-
tinue to guide us for years to come. 
It is an honor to offer my sincerest 
congratulations to Dr. Anfinson on his 
retirement. Minnesota thanks him for 
his countless contributions to the envi-
ronment and our treasured Mississippi 
River.∑

TRIBUTE TO CATHY HUGHES 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor a tenacious entre-
preneur, visionary radio personality, 
and powerful advocate for the African- 
American community, Cathy Hughes. 
This year, her pioneering radio com-
pany, Urban One, celebrated 40 years 
on the air. Cathy Hughes has left an in-
delible mark on the State of Maryland 
and 
inspired 
millions 
of 
listeners 
across the country. 
This titan of the airwaves began her 
extraordinary career in Omaha, NE, 
where she worked for a local radio sta-
tion, KOWH. But it was when she 
moved to Washington, DC, in 1971 to 
pursue a job at the Howard University 
School of Communications that her ca-
reer took off. While working at How-
ard, she got involved in the univer-
sity’s radio program as a station man-
ager. In her first year on the job, she 
increased the station’s revenue twelve-
fold. 
Cathy Hughes has always aimed high, 
and when she learned that the local DC 
radio station WOL was up for sale, she 
seized the opportunity. After being de-
nied a loan 32 times, she finally re-
ceived the bank financing she needed. 
So she purchased WOL, founded her 
own media company, Radio One, and 
quickly soared to new heights. Cathy 
Hughes revolutionized radio by rebuild-
ing WOL from the ground up, literally, 
and brought on grassroots volunteers 
from the neighborhood to develop her 
station’s headquarters on H Street and 
4th Northeast, just a short walk from 
the U.S. Capitol. Her innovative broad-
casts captured the attention of the Af-
rican-American community and at-
tracted a wide audience of devoted lis-
teners. 
Although she got her start in Wash-
ington, DC, Cathy Hughes has become 
a champion for Maryland. When her 
company first expanded out of Wash-
ington, its first stop was Baltimore. 
And her flagship venture, which was re-
named Urban One in 2017, is now 
headquartered in Silver Spring. She 
has cultivated strong roots in Anne 
Arundel County and has been living in 
Pasadena for 20 years. Today, Urban 
One’s 
broadcasts 
reach 
households 
across Maryland and provide a plat-
form for honest conversation on the 
issues that matter to our State. Cathy 
Hughes has given back time and time 
again to the communities that raised 
her up by hiring locally and employing 
countless Marylanders. That tradition 
of uplifting others has remained a hall-
mark of her career. Her company, 
which now houses two new multimedia 
ventures, CLEO TV and TV One, both 
stationed in Maryland, has created 
1,500 jobs. 
In the 40 years since purchasing 
WOL, Cathy Hughes has never stopped 
overcoming barriers. In 1999, she be-
came 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman to chair the board of a publicly 
held corporation. She headed the first 
African-American-run company to suc-
ceed in multiple radio markets simul-
taneously. Cathy Hughes made history 
again as the first woman to own a 
radio station ranked No. 1. Her trail-
blazing 
multimedia 
enterprise 
now 
reaches 82 percent of the African-Amer-
ican community and has cultivated a 
devoted weekly following of 15 million 
listeners. 
Speaking of Cathy Hughes’ inspiring 
career, Reverend Al Sharpton said, 
‘‘She took the ‘mute’ button off of 
Black America.’’ Her legacy has been 
defined by a commitment to speaking 
up for those who have long been silent 
in the radio arena. While she has al-
ready lived a storied life and achieved 
enormous success, Cathy Hughes hasn’t 
slowed down. Her recent efforts to 
highlight local Black businesses strug-
gling to weather the storm of this pan-
demic speaks to the depth of her life-
long passion for shining the spotlight 
on others. While her name has already 
been inscribed on the aptly renamed 
Cathy Hughes School for Communica-

MENDING THE UNITED STATES 
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT FOUN-

ITS 
40TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
FOR 
CREATING PATHWAYS TO PROS-
PERITY 
FOR 
UNDERSERVED 
COMMUNITIES ON THE AFRICAN 
CONTINENT 
THROUGH 
COMMU-
NITY-LED DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. COONS (for himself and Mr. 
INHOFE) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 802 
Whereas December 16, 2020, marks the 40th 
anniversary of the establishment of the 
United States African Development Founda-
tion (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘USADF’’); 
Whereas, on December 16, 1980 the Presi-
dent signed the African Development Foun-
dation Act (22 U.S.C. 290h et seq.) into law, 
which established the USADF as an inde-
pendent Federal agency with the goal to— 
(1) strengthen the bonds of friendship and 
understanding between the people of the 
countries of Africa and the United States; 
(2) support local capacity building to cre-
ate community development opportunities 
and expand the participation of the countries 
of Africa in their development process; and 
(3) foster the establishment and growth of 
indigenous development institutions that are 
equipped to respond to local needs; 
Whereas, for 40 years, the USADF has in-
vested in a pan-African network of local im-
plementing partners that employ a commu-
nity-led development approach to support 
African-designed and African-delivered solu-
tions; 
Whereas the USADF has provided more 
than 3,400 grassroots and community enter-
prise grants in more than 40 sub-Saharan Af-
rican countries; 
Whereas the USADF strengthens food secu-
rity, empowers smallholder farmers, and cre-
ates economic growth in rural, hard-to-reach 
communities by investing primarily in agri-
cultural enterprises to increase access to 
larger markets for those rural communities 
and 
enhance 
the 
business 
management 
skills, production, distribution, and mar-
keting capabilities of those rural commu-
nities; 
Whereas the USADF has maintained a 
strong emphasis on women and women entre-
preneurs, and women represent up to 65 per-
cent of the direct beneficiaries of grants 
from the USADF; 
Whereas, on February 20, 2020, the USADF 
partnered with the Academy for Entre-
preneurs of the Department of State under 
the Women’s Global Development and Pros-
perity Initiative to provide seed funding to 
graduates of the Academy for Entrepreneurs 
to advance the global economic empower-
ment of women; 
Whereas the USADF prioritizes partner-
ships with youth and supports nearly 300 so-
cial enterprises of Young African Leaders 
Initiative fellows and alumni of that initia-
tive in 37 sub-Saharan African countries by 
providing seed capital, technical assistance, 
and skills training to help young entre-
preneurs create businesses that generate new 
jobs and incomes for thousands of young Af-
ricans; 
Whereas the work of the USADF in the off- 
grid energy sector, which is authorized under 
the Electrify Africa Act of 2015 (22 U.S.C. 
2293 note), has helped bring renewable energy 
solutions to communities with limited or no 
connections to national power grids and im-
prove energy access for nearly 370,000 indi-
viduals in 15 sub-Saharan African countries; 
Whereas the USADF’s model of using 100 
percent African staff and implementing part-
ners on the African continent gives the 
USADF the ability to work in fragile and 
conflict-affected areas in the Great Lakes, 
Horn, and Sahel regions of Africa; 
Whereas the small size of the USADF and 
the use of local implementing partners by 
the USADF has allowed the USADF to be 
ranked as one of the most efficient providers 
of foreign aid by the Center for Global Devel-
opment; 
Whereas the partnerships of the USADF 
with agencies of the Federal Government, in-
cluding the Department of State, the Millen-
nium Challenge Corporation, and the United 
States Agency for International Develop-
ment, along with the alignment of the 
USADF with the priorities of Congress, have 
allowed the USADF to extend the reach of 
critical 
development 
initiatives 
of 
the 
United States, such as initiatives authorized 
by the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22 
U.S.C. 9301 et seq.), the Electrify Africa Act 
of 2015 (22 U.S.C. 2293 note), and the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium 
Challenge Act Modernization Act (Public 
Law 115-167; 132 Stat. 1276); 
Whereas the partnerships between the 
USADF and private sector corporations and 
foundations, as well as African national and 
sub-national governments, have allowed the 
USADF to extend its reach and development 
impact in addressing food insecurity, insuffi-
cient access to energy, and unemployment 
through youth and women entrepreneurship 
and job skills training and placement in Af-
rica, while leveraging funding to help the 
dollars of taxpayers in the United States go 
further; and 
Whereas investments made by the USADF 
have developed and strengthened an exten-
sive network of grassroots enterprises and 
social enterprises that are positively dis-
posed to the United States and are better po-
sitioned to partner with other Federal agen-
cies and public and private funders: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the United States African 
Development Foundation on the occasion of 
its 40th anniversary for creating pathways to 
prosperity for underserved communities on 
the African continent through community- 
led development; 
(2) recognizes that, by supporting African- 
led development that grows community en-
terprises, the United States African Develop-
ment Foundation empowers individuals who 
are who are least served by existing markets 
or assistance programs to become a part of 
the growth story of Africa; 
(3) recognizes that the United States Afri-
can Development Foundation advances the 
foreign policy of the Federal Government 
and contributes directly to the national in-
terests of the United States; and 
(4) commits to continue to support the 
vital work of the United States African De-
velopment Foundation as an independent 
agency.

SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) On September 11, 2012, the United 
States 
consulate, 
and 
its 
personnel 
in 
Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants. 
(2) Four Americans were killed in the at-
tack, including Ambassador J. Christopher 
Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Ty-
rone Woods. 
(3) Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were 
former Navy SEALs who served as security 
personnel in Libya. As the attack unfolded, 
they bravely attempted to defend American 
property and protect United States diplo-
matic personnel. In so doing, they selflessly 
sacrificed their own lives. 
(4) Glen Doherty was a Navy SEAL for 12 
years and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He 
attained the rank of Petty Officer First 
Class and earned the Navy and Marine Corps 
Commendation Medal. After leaving the 
Navy, Glen Doherty worked with the Depart-
ment of State to protect American dip-
lomats. 
(5) Tyrone Woods served for 20 years as a 
Navy SEAL including tours in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. In Iraq he led multiple raids and 
reconnaissance missions and earned the 
Bronze Star. After retiring from the Navy as 
a Senior Chief Petty Officer, Tyrone Woods 
worked with the Department of State to pro-
tect American diplomats. 
(6) J. Christopher Stevens served for 21 
years in the U.S. Foreign Service. He was 
serving as U.S. Ambassador to Libya and 
previously served twice in the country, as 
both Special Representative to the Libyan 
Transitional National Council and as the 
Deputy Chief of Mission. Earlier in his life, 
he also served as a Peace Corps volunteer 
teaching English in Morocco. 
(7) Sean Smith served for 6 years in the 
U.S. Air Force. He attained the rank of Staff 
Sergeant and was awarded the Air Force 
Commendation Medal. After leaving the Air 
Force, Sean Smith served for 10 years in the 
State Department on various assignments, 
which took him to places such as Baghdad, 
Brussels, Pretoria, and The Hague. 
(8) As their careers attest, all four men 
served their country honorably.

December 15, 2020 
IN HONOR OF SHAWN 
CHRISTIANSON 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize a great local leader in my district, 
Shawn Christianson, as she leaves the 
Hillsborough Town Council after eight years. 
She is departing public life after a quarter cen-
tury of volunteer and elective service to her 
community. She will be deeply missed. 
Shawn Christianson is brilliant, honest, up-
beat, and leaves a whirlwind in her wake as 
she moves through life. She brought her 
boundless energy and positive attitude to an 
extraordinary number of activities, all while 
working full time in a San Francisco legal 
practice, where she is now a partner, I might 
also point out she raised two children, Spen-
cer and Conor, at the same time. 
For over 14 years before being named Cit-
izen of the Year in 2010, Shawn served on the 
North School Site Council and on the North 
Parent Group Executive Board. She was 
President of the Association of Parent Groups 
and then became Vice President of the 
Hillsborough Schools Foundation. In 2001/02, 
she was part of a small group of persons who 
led a successful effort to pass school bonds. 
Even after her children graduated, she re-
mained committed to the schools and in 2005 
was elected to the school board, serving four 
years including one as board president. In her 
role, she was instrumental in the design and 
reconstruction of four schools. 
As if working full time as a bankruptcy attor-
ney and raising two children were not enough, 
Shawn also advised the Bay Area Women’s 
and Children’s Center, an agency serving chil-
dren in families with little or no income. At one 
point she was on the board of directors of a 
local children’s museum, and on the Cal 
Berkeley Parents Board. To top off her frenetic 
pace, she coached a mock trial team at her 
son’s high school. These activities were in the 
days when ‘‘Zoom’’ was a description of speed 
and not shorthand for pandemic reality. Just 
imagine the number of hours spent by Shawn 
in study and advocacy as she met—in a group 
at countless points on the map—to uphold 
these commitments. Her husband, Philip 
McLeod, might be forgiven if he thought he’d 
married a Ferrari instead of a loving wife, 
mother and formidable attorney. 
Shawn was elected to the Hillsborough city 
council in 2012 and has served continuously 
since, including as Mayor since 2018 (her sec-
ond time as Mayor), and Vice Mayor from 
2016 to 2018. When presiding during council 
meetings, she handled difficult matters with 
grace and tact, seeking consensus despite the 
passions of the moment. We know Shawn as 
a voice of reason, but as she wields the gavel 
during a tense meeting her pitch is authori-
tative because she always comes prepared. 
Woe be to advocates who try to gloss over 
weaknesses in a proposal hoping that no one 
will notice. Shawn Christianson reads foot-
notes. She’ll notice. 
Like the residents she serves, Shawn is 
dedicated to maintaining the natural beauty of 
Hillsborough, its small-town atmosphere, pre-
serving its architectural heritage and maintain-
ing strong finances. Despite upheavals in our 
nation’s economy, Hillsborough’s budget is 
balanced each year and its long-term fiscal 
outlook is bright. 
As a partner in the Buchalter law firm, 
Shawn focuses her practice on insolvency, re-
ceiverships, and complex litigation with an em-
phasis on technology related issues. She’s ar-
gued at both the trial level and at the Ninth 
Circuit Court of Appeals. Her list of profes-
sional accomplishments takes up a full page 
of small type, but includes serving for two 
terms on the Board of Directors and as a Di-
rector-At-Large of the International Women’s 
Insolvency and Restructuring Confederation 
and as both the Chair and Vice-Chair of the 
Bar Association of San Francisco’s Commer-
cial Law and Bankruptcy section. Shawn is a 
trained mediator and has been a Resolution 
Advocate on the Bankruptcy Dispute Resolu-
tion Panel. 
With one notable exception, I can think of 
no one in the country who seems to enjoy 
going through bankruptcy. With Shawn on 
your team, I can think of no one better to be 
at your side. 
Madam Speaker, in our modern economy, 
billions are made through the construction of 
fictional heroes of boundless powers proving 
themselves 
through 
unending 
challenges. 
Shawn Christianson is the real deal. As she 
retires to private and professional life, we 
thank her for a generation of contributions on 
our behalf. If you turn off the electricity to the 
world of a fictional hero, it fades to black. If 
you remove Shawn Christianson from public 
life, her accomplishments will live for decades. 
I thank Shawn for her friendship and out-
standing example. In a democracy, there is no 
higher compliment than to say that you made 
a difference. She certainly did and we—her 
friends and neighbors—are forever in her 
debt.

CONGRATULATING 
MS. 
ANGELE 
GILROY ON 47 YEARS OF PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
WITH 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my constituent, Ms. Angele 
Gilroy, and to congratulate her on her retire-
ment following 47 years of dedicated service 
to the U.S. Congress and our nation as an an-
alyst with the Congressional Research Serv-
ice. 
Ms. Gilroy began her federal service in 1974 
and has since become CRS’s principle analyst 
on telecommunications policy. In this role, she 
has served all 541 Congressional offices and 
multiple committees who have all benefited 
from her expertise gained through decades of 
research. Ms. Gilroy has consistently provided 
accurate, nonpartisan analysis to Congres-
sional Members and staff to inform policy deci-
sions during high-profile events including 
broadband deployment for COVID–19, Net 
Neutrality 
debates, 
the 
landmark 
Tele-
communications Act of 1996, and the Bell tele-
phone system dissolution in 1984. 
But one of the most important services that 
Ms. Gilroy has provided is what she has given 
to the future generations at CRS. Ms. Gilroy 
has formally mentored new employees and 
provided informal guidance to others on writ-
ing, briefing, and research, ensuring CRS will 
continue to provide the highest-quality policy 
analysis to Congress. The standard of excel-
lence she set will be upheld and her legacy 
will go on through the continued efforts of 
those she trained counseled. 
Ms. Gilroy has served under eight U.S. 
Presidents, continuing to excel in her profes-
sional duties as the country progressed into 
new ideals, advanced technologies, and in-
creased security measures. The changes that 
Ms. Gilroy has been a part of have been in-
strumental, and her dedication to accurate 
data and robust nonpartisan policy analysis 
have been pillars for others to emulate. I am 
proud to represent Ms. Gilroy in Congress, 
and I thank her for the invaluable contributions 
she has made during her distinguished career. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending Ms. Gilroy and in thanking 
her for her nearly half a century of public serv-
ice.

REMEMBERING ARTIS GILLAM SR. 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
remember the life of Artis Gillam Sr., of 
Youngstown, Ohio, who passed away on Sun-
day, December 6, 2020 at the age of 78. 
Mr. Gillam was born July 17, 1942, in 
Moultrie, Georgia, a son of Rufus and Vallie 
Edmondson Gillam. He was a 1961 graduate 
of North High School and attended Youngs-
town State University, majoring in business 
administration. 
Artis was a lifelong member of Price Memo-
rial A.M.E. Zion Church, where he served on 
the steward and trustee boards. A man who 
always sought to be a leader and never a fol-
lower, Artis’ goal was definitely to be an ex-
traordinary businessman. An entrepreneur, he 
was owner/operator of many ventures: Gillam 
& Associates, Inc., Life Skills Carpentry and 
Painting (LCAP), Artis’ Tender Love and Care 
(a safe haven for young girls), and Mr. G’s 
Eastside Tire, Lube and Wash. 
He also served in many community capac-
ities, including as a Mahoning County deputy

sheriff (reserves) and on Youngstown City 
Council for the 1st Ward. In early years, he 
had been employed at Packard Electric, Ohio 
Fast Freight, and Stallworth Real Estate and 
Construction Co. Inc. Artis was also very in-
strumental in getting the Covelli Center built 
and opening up Federal Street to through traf-
fic. 
In addition to his many jobs and positions, 
Artis found time to volunteer on many boards 
and other organizations important to Youngs-
town and the Mahoning Valley. 
He leaves to carry on his legacy and cher-
ish his beloved memories, his wife, the former 
Annie L. Spooney, whom he married March 
15, 1962; four children, Artis Gillam Jr. of 
Cleveland, Arnold Gillam Sr., Adrienne (Rod-
ney) Davis and Andrea Gillam, all of Youngs-
town; seven grandchildren, Tamica Gillam, 
Artis Gillam III, Arnold (Hannah) Gillam Jr., 
Rodney Davis, Jr., Alexis Gillam, Andre 
(Shalena) Davis and Denzel Davis: and 15 
great-grandchildren, Andre Davis Jr., Amire, 
Amira and Alena Davis, Armani Johnson, 
Talaya and Reggie Dunlap, Artis IV, Nariah, 
Gianna, Markez, Amiah, Kayel, Amari, and 
Kenna Gillam. He also leaves six sisters-in- 
law, Juanell (Sylvester Sr.) Patton, Janice Bur-
roughs, Joyce Dean-El, Linda Jenkins, Brenda 
Boudreaux and Margie Ann Leonard; and a 
host of nieces, nephews, other family and 
friends. 
Besides his parents, he was preceded in 
death by three brothers, Homer Jenkins, L. V. 
Jenkins and Douglas Gillam; his sister-in-law, 
Shirley Gillam; his brother-in-law, Charles 
Spooney; and his favorite uncle, Ruben 
Edmondson. 
There is no doubt that Councilman Gillam 
was a giant in Youngstown and dedicated his 
life to our community. I was very proud to rep-
resent the great people of Youngstown along-
side Mr. Gillam. My deepest sympathies go 
out to Mr. Gillam’s family and to all whose 
lives he touched.

REMEMBERING REVEREND JAMES 
L. NETTERS 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember a giant of the Memphis commu-
nity—the Reverend James LaVirt Netters Sr., 
who passed on Sunday at the age of 93. Rev-
erend Netters served more than 60 years as 
the senior pastor of Mount Vernon Baptist 
Church in Westwood. Reverend Netters grad-
uated from the historic Booker T. Washington 
High School, which produced other noted 
alumni such as civil rights activist Maxine 
Smith and civil rights attorney Judge Russell 
B. Sugarmon Jr. He went on to graduate from 
LeMoyne-Owen College, a historically Black 
college. He was a Memphis City Schools 
teacher when he responded to Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King Jr.’s clarion call for jobs and freedom 
and attended the 1963 March on Washington. 
He returned to Memphis galvanized to ad-
dress integrated public accommodations, get-
ting arrested, like Rosa Parks, and encour-
aging other ministers to join him, in sitting in 
whites-only sections of buses in demonstra-
tions that resulted in desegregating the sys-
tem. Determined to make a difference in the 
lives of Black people, he turned to electoral 
politics. He was one of the first three Black 
City Council members sworn into office in Jan-
uary 1968, along with the Reverend J.O. Pat-
terson and Fred Davis, and worked tirelessly 
behind the scenes during the Sanitation Work-
ers Strike that led to the assassination of Dr. 
King that year. After his Council service, he 
was an administrative assistant and served as 
a community liaison for Memphis Mayor 
Wyeth Chandler from 1972 to 1975. He later 
received a master’s degree and a doctorate in 
Divinity from Memphis Theological Seminary, 
where a faculty chair in Rhetoric and African 
American Studies is named in his honor. Rev-
erend Netters was a stand-up pastor whose 
friendships and influence knew no bounds. He 
was the longest-serving pastor of a single 
church in the City of Memphis and was re-
spected for his moral authority. Other pastors 
and ministers held him in high regard for his 
leadership, activism, commitment to ministry 
and the community, and his focus-driven life. 
Noted for his work outside the church as well, 
Reverend Netters served on the board and as 
chairman of the Memphis Light, Gas and 
Water Division. MLG&W’s business center 
building is named in his honor, as is a portion 
of Third Street—James L. Netters Parkway. 
An open-minded leader and a man of impec-
cable character, he respected all people; there 
was not a prejudiced bone in his body. He 
reached across all religious, gender, political 
and racial groups as a respected bridge that 
brought all of Memphis together. I appreciated 
his friendship and his solid support, especially 
during my early runs for Congress. I was hon-
ored to take him as my guest to the annual 
Congressional Prayer Breakfast where he was 
pleased to meet with President Obama. I ex-
press my profound condolences to his family 
and to the Mount Vernon Baptist Church com-
munity he served so well. He led an exem-
plary life and will be missed.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
JOSEPH ‘‘JOE’’ ALEXANDER 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life of Joseph ‘‘Joe’’ Alexander, 
a pivotal Northern Virginia leader who passed 
away peacefully at home on August 30, 2020 
at the age of 90. 
Joe Alexander was born in Pittsburgh, PA 
on December 21, 1929 to Celia and Milton 
Alexander. When Joe was young, the family 
relocated to Northern Virginia where Joe 
would spend his life. In 1956, Joe married the 
love of his life Davina, and together they 
raised their two daughters Cathy and Cheri. 
Joe dedicated his life to bettering the com-
munity in which he grew up by serving others. 
He was a veteran of the Korean War and 
served in the Air Force where he was pro-
moted to the rank of 1st Lieutenant. After-
wards, Joe returned to the Franconia section 
of Fairfax County where he owned and man-
aged Franconia Hardware. He was urged by 
other local business owners to run for the 
Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and 
began his first term in office in 1964. He 
served a total of 32 years, finally stepping 
down when his 8th term ended in December 
1995. 
During Joe’s years of service on the Board, 
he was affectionately known as ‘‘Pothole Joe’’ 
because no level of constituent service was 
too small for him to personally address. He 
shaped the transformation of his district from 
one of un-regulated gravel pits to an area 
known for its vibrant planned communities. 
Joe believed that an integrated transpor-
tation network was critical to the continued 
growth and prosperity of the region. In 1964, 
Joe was a founding member of the Northern 
Virginia Transportation Commission on which 
he served for 25 years representing our region 
in mass transit systems such as WMATA, 
VRE, and the Fairfax Connector. Working with 
others he was instrumental in transforming 
four separate privately owned bus companies 
into the Metrobus system. In recognition of his 
immeasurable contributions to public transpor-
tation, the Joe Alexander Transportation Cen-
ter (commonly referred to as the Franconia- 
Springfield Metro Station) was named after 
him, and in 2008 after serving as its Chair, 
Joe was inducted into the American Public 
Transportation Association Hall of Fame. 
Public service was at the core of who Joe 
was. In addition to his contributions in trans-
portation and community planning, Joe was a 
volunteer with the Franconia Volunteer Fire 
Department. His love for his community and 
its history led him to donate his time as a vol-
unteer and a Board Member with the Fran-
conia Museum. Joe also had an adventurous 
spirit—he loved to travel, enjoyed good food 
and wine, and football. But above all Joe was 
a dedicated and loving husband, father and 
grandfather. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Joseph 
Alexander. His leadership and commitment to 
public service helped lay the foundation for the 
county and he will be missed by all who knew 
him. I also extend my deepest condolences to 
his wife of 64 years, Davina; his daughters, 
Cathy Stevens (Ed) and Cheri Roth (Rich); 
and granddaughter Stephanie Roth. May his 
memory be a blessing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1145 
December 15, 2020 
Commissioner Hodge was born and raised 
on the eastern plains, an area she has well- 
represented for decades. Throughout her ten-
ure serving the State of Colorado, Commis-
sioner Hodge has held numerous positions. 
Commissioner Hodge was elected to the Colo-
rado House of Representatives in 2000 where 
she served two terms. She then was elected 
to the Colorado State Senate and finished her 
second term in 2016. During her time in the 
Colorado State Legislature, Commissioner 
Hodge held several leadership roles, including 
Chair of the House Local Government Com-
mittee, Chair and Vice Chair of the Joint 
Budget Committee, and Chair of both the 
Rural Economic Development and Early Child-
hood Development Joint Legislative Interim 
Committees. As a legislator she championed 
legislation supporting whistleblower protections 
for local government employees; Newborn 
Heart Defect Screening Pulse Oximetry; and 
the completion of Fitzsimons Veteran Commu-
nity Living facility. 
In 2016, Commissioner Hodge was elected 
to serve as the District 5 County Commis-
sioner for Adams County, and in 2018, she 
served as Chair of the Board. As Commis-
sioner, she maintained an equitable trajectory 
of projects for the eastern plains, the most no-
table being the pioneering of an innovative 
new gravel road mixture and technique. An-
other notable achievement driven by Commis-
sioner Hodge was the designation of the new 
Colorado Air and Space Port. She was critical 
in championing this project, garnering political 
support and refining Adams County’s proposal 
to expedite the comfort and trust of their part-
ners at Denver International Airport. 
While our state has been blessed with capa-
ble leadership throughout its history, few rise 
to the caliber and reputation of Commissioner 
Hodge. I wish Commissioner Hodge all the 
best in retirement and send gratitude for her 
service to the Adams County community and 
the great state of Colorado. I thank her for her 
service.

HONORING MICK GLEASON ON HIS 
RETIREMENT FROM THE KERN 
COUNTY 
BOARD 
OF 
SUPER-
VISORS 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kern County Supervisor 
and U.S. Navy Captain (ret.) Michael ‘‘Mick’’ 
Gleason. After 35 years of service to his coun-
try and community, Mick is retiring from public 
service at the end of his current term on the 
Kern County Board of Supervisors. 
Mick was born in Nyack, New York and later 
moved to Haverhill, Massachusetts, where he 
‘‘unfortunately’’ became a fan of all things 
Boston, including the New England Patriots. In 
1972, Mick graduated from the University of 
Notre Dame with a bachelor’s degree in Busi-
ness Administration and enlisted in the United 
States Navy. Later in 1999, he enrolled in the 
Naval Postgraduate School and earned a 
master’s degree in Astronautical Engineering. 
During his time in the Navy, Mick became 
Commanding Officer of Naval Air Weapons 
Station (NAWS) China Lake, located in 
Ridgecrest, California, which is what led him 
and his wife, Robynn, to Kern County, in 
2004. He served as the NAWS China Lake 
Commanding Officer for 2 years. 
After retiring from the Navy, Mick decided to 
continue his public service and successfully 
ran for and was elected to the Kern County 
Board of Supervisors, being sworn-in as the 
1st District Supervisor in 2013. Over his ten-
ure on the Board, Mick has been a consistent 
advocate for eastern Kern County, touting the 
importance of and opportunities related to the 
region’s economic strengths and highly edu-
cated workforce, fighting to attract more and 
diversified businesses to the area. He has 
also helped lead the County response through 
difficult times, from the Erskine Fire to the July 
2019 earthquakes that damaged Ridgecrest 
and NAWS China Lake. He has also been a 
vociferous advocate for NAWS China Lake, 
knowing that a healthy and robust mission at 
the base translates to the Ridgecrest commu-
nity. And, Mick has never shied away from 
working on controversial, but important issues 
from reforming the Kern Medical Center to 
spear heading water conservation in the In-
dian Wells Valley following enactment of a 
state law on groundwater sustainability. 
Over the years, Mick has been a good 
friend and advisor with his pulse on the 
Ridgecrest and northeastern Kern County. 
Using the skills he developed during his time 
in the U.S. Navy, Mick has always impressed 
me with his acumen, including the ability to 
quickly weigh issues, size-up the impacts to 
the community, and make a decision. And for 
anyone who knows Mick, once he makes a 
decision, he doggedly follows through working 
to persuade and promote the policy in his 
trademark accent—a combination of the Bos-
ton, Kern County, and western lexicons, with 
a smattering of military jargon thrown in for 
good measure—which is renown throughout 
our community. 
I thank Mick for his years of service to our 
community, both as the Commanding Officer 
of NAWS China Lake and later as a Kern 
County Supervisor. Although Mick is taking a 
step back from his role in public service, I am 
confident that he will continue to lend his time 
and expertise to many of the causes that he 
holds dear. I wish him well as he begins this 
new chapter of his life, and I know that he is 
looking forward to spending more time with 
Robynn, and their three sons, Wes, Paddy, 
and Jeff, and their families.

RECOGNIZING LANGLEY RESIDEN-
TIAL 
EXECUTIVE 
DIRECTOR 
BETSY SCHATZ 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Langley Residential Executive Di-
rector Betsy Schatz for the service she has 
provided to our developmental disability com-
munity for more than three decades. 
The Langley Residential Support Services is 
a non-profit organization and was founded in 
1983 by three churches in McLean, Virginia. It 
has since continued to expand its reach 
across the county to help as many people as 
possible. In fact, Langley now has 15 fulltime 
employees, 14 part-time employees and ap-
proximately 30 volunteers who provide support 
and services to adults with developmental dis-
abilities and their families. 
For the past 36 years, Langley has been 
helping families ensure that their adult child, 
sister, brother or other loved one with a devel-
opmental disability has a home to call his or 
her own. Langley Residential Support Services 
is dedicated to the mission that all people, re-
gardless of developmental disabilities, have 
the right to live in dignity and as independently 
as possible—allowing all to participate as fully 
as possible in our society. 
Since 1988, Betsy Schatz has been at the 
forefront of the great work and growth of the 
organization. For 31 years she has been a 
passionate advocate for people with develop-
mental disabilities and is a true leader in our 
community. Under her stewardship Langley 
has been able to expand their assistance to 
six residential homes, several community 
drop-in services, and provides numerous other 
resources to benefit its clients and their fami-
lies. Langley is a pioneer in this field and as-
sisted more than 50 individuals in the last year 
alone. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending Langley Residential Exec-
utive Director Betsy Schatz and in thanking 
her for her tireless efforts and dedication. She 
and her team strive to ensure that those with 
developmental disabilities have fair opportuni-
ties and a quality of life that all people de-
serve. I wish Executive Director Betsy Schatz 
and Langley Residential Support Services 
continued success in fulfilling their admirable 
mission.

IN HONOR OF ADAM EISEN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Adam Eisen who served on the 
Half Moon Bay City Council for four years, the 
last year as Mayor. Mayor Eisen is one of the 
most energetic and optimistic public servants 
with whom I’ve had the honor to work. 
When Adam ran for city council in 2016, he 
would have never imagined the challenges the 
year 2020 would present him while he was 
mayor of this beautiful coastal town of 13,000. 
He had to respond to a global pandemic not 
seen in a century, the resulting economic 
downturn, devastating wildfires ravaging Cali-
fornia communities, and a national social jus-
tice movement demanding racial equity. 
Adam was a regular presence on weekly 
county briefings that included more than 200 
public officials from school districts, cities, the 
county, the state and the federal government. 
In weekly newsletters, Adam relayed much of 
that information about Covid–19 to residents, 
from case numbers to testing to business clo-
sures, school closures and beach closures. In 
the early days of the pandemic during the stay 
at home order, the entire county of San Mateo 
flocked to the coast to get away and get out-
side. Local beaches and parking lots resem-
bled Times Square during New Year’s Eve. 
Safety concerns motivated Adam to initiate a 
five mile from home shelter in place order for 
the county. As an avid surfer and outdoors en-
thusiast, this was counterintuitive, but Adam

December 15, 2020 
saw it as a necessary tool to slow community 
spread of the deadly virus. 
In mid-August, lightening struck, literally. 
More than 14,000 lightening strikes set off a 
series of 650 wildfires, eventually burning over 
two million acres in California. One of the 
fires, the CZU Lightening Complex, burned in 
San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties, Adam 
rose to the occasion and responded to this 
disaster on top of the Covid disaster. He co-
ordinated with other officials to assure emer-
gency vehicles had access to hotspots. He set 
up Smith Field to assist evacuated fire victims. 
Adam was drawn to public service by three 
broad and ambitious goals. He wanted com-
munity members to be involved, he wanted to 
engage a younger constituency, and he want-
ed to have the most qualified staff work for the 
city. 
Shortly after Adam and his wife Katherine 
moved to Half Moon Bay from Connecticut, a 
tractor ran into a bridge that he used to bike 
to his mother’s house. The damaged bridge 
was demolished and his path to his mom’s 
was gone. He attended multiple council meet-
ings lobbying to fix the bridge. With his typical 
optimism, he later told the local newspaper: 
‘‘The bridge did get fixed; it just took a few 
years and it’s fantastic.’’ 
As a devoted father of two young children, 
Kaleb, 12 and Ezra, 9, Adam wanted to make 
sure young families and younger people were 
represented on the council. He created an 
open channel of communication and made 
sure their voices were heard. 
During his tenure on the council, Adam and 
his colleagues completed updates of Half 
Moon Bay’s Local Coastal Plan and the Gen-
eral Plan with a great deal of community input. 
Both plans will impact the area for the next 
two to three decades. He was also deeply in-
volved in the hiring of a new city manager and 
city attorney. 
Adam worked on the Parks and Recreation 
Master Plan to set standards and guidelines 
for new and existing parks. He helped revise 
the City’s contract with local horseback riding 
stable operators to keep beaches accessible 
for riding yet free of horse manure so that all 
visitors can enjoy them. He was instrumental 
in banning single use plastic and flavored to-
bacco to keep our environment and our chil-
dren safer. 
The pandemic-induced economic downturn 
required quick and decisive action to keep 
Half Moon Bay solvent. To increase city rev-
enue, Adam helped initiate Measure U, a bal-
lot initiative increasing transient occupancy 
taxes, which passed by over 70%. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Adam Eisen who served the resi-
dents of Half Moon Bay for four years that feel 
like a lifetime. He is leaving the council, but I 
am certain his next chapter will be filled with 
adventure and with contributions that will ben-
efit everyone on the coastside. It’s been my 
honor to serve with him.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
FREDERICK LEONARD BOLLINGER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
in 
memory 
of 
Frederick 
Leonard 
Bollinger, who passed away on September 22, 
2020, at the age of 103. A native of 
Sebastopol, California, Frederick was a deco-
rated Army sergeant who served in the Euro-
pean theater during World War II where he 
earned numerous battle stars and a Bronze 
Star for valor. Following his military service, 
Frederick returned home to Sebastopol where 
he would work on his family’s ranch until the 
late 1970s. At the time of his death, Frederick 
was one of the oldest living veterans of World 
War II in the region he called home. 
The Bollinger family ranch was sold in 1978 
and following the sale, Frederick would go on 
to volunteer at the Luther Burbank Experi-
mental Gardens, where he helped maintain 
the nursery for decades. In addition to his 
fame as one of the region’s oldest living WWII 
veterans, there’s a widespread belief in 
Sonoma County that Frederick may have been 
the area’s last living links to the famed bota-
nist Burbank. In his retirement, Bollinger also 
joined such organizations as the Native Sons 
of the Golden West and Veterans of Foreign 
Wars. He spent lots of time traveling to World 
War II reunions—and jumping on cruise ships, 
a favorite vacation outing of his. On the occa-
sion of his 100th birthday, the County of 
Sonoma declared October 12 would be known 
as Frederick Bollinger Day. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in com-
memorating the life of a bona fide World War 
II hero and a beloved member of his commu-
nity. He will be missed.

RECOGNIZING VICKI GRAHAM FOR 
32 YEARS OF SERVICE WITH AC-
TION IN COMMUNITY THROUGH 
SERVICE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Vicki Graham for her 32 
years of service to Action in Community 
Through Service (ACTS). 
Ms. Graham has become the longest serv-
ing employee in ACTS’ 51-year history. As a 
community organization, ACTS fosters hope, 
provides relief, and promotes self-sufficiency 
for Prince William area neighbors in crisis. 
And Ms. Graham has been an essential part 
of developing this foundation. 
Ms. Graham has been a critical part of 
ACTS and throughout her time with the orga-
nization, she enhanced several of the pro-
grams ACTS has offered. She served as the 
longest Director of the ACTS Helpline. What 
started as a local volunteer hotline has now 
grown to become a professional crisis hotline 
with the largest coverage in the Common-
wealth of Virginia, and a backup call center for 
the National Suicide Prevention Hotline. The 
Helpline answers over 20,000 calls annually 
which includes over 4,000 suicide crisis calls 
answered each year. Ms. Graham has been 
key in making what the ACTS Helpline is 
today. 
Through her 32-year career at ACTS, Ms. 
Graham has several accomplishments in 
which further shows the selfless effort she put 
into her work. Ms. Graham founded the Senior 
Link program, the Local Outreach to Suicide 
Survivors (LOSS) Team, the Surviving After 
Suicide support group, the Parents of Suicide 
Loss support group, Renewed Hope peer sup-
port group and the Traumatic Death Support 
Group peer led support group. These pro-
grams that were founded by Ms. Graham not 
only provide support to the participants, they 
also better our community. Ms. Graham did 
not stop there. She became ACTS first Chief 
Program Officer, overseeing the operation of 
ACTS Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, 
Helpline, and Housing services. 
I congratulate Ms. Graham and commend 
her for all she has accomplished. Helpline pro-
gram participants and our community have 
benefited immensely thanks to her tireless ef-
forts to make tomorrow better for everyone. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating Vicki Graham on her 
retirement and thank her for her everlasting 
impact on the Prince William County commu-
nity.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF RON MINER, 
‘DJ INDIANA JONES’ 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to honor and remember an Indian-
apolis legend, and my friend, Ron Miner, also 
known as DJ Indiana Jones who passed on 
Friday, December 4th. 
Ron was an Indianapolis native, attending 
Ben Davis High School on our community’s 
west side and DJing for his family’s business 
‘Melody Skateland’ in the 1980s. He fell in 
love with hip-hop at an early age and moved 
to New York City where he promoted for art-
ists such as Boogiemonsters and Heather B 
before returning to his hometown. Ron estab-
lished himself as a familiar voice in the Indian-
apolis hip-hop and Reggae music scenes, 
managing a local hip-hop group, the Mudkids, 
and later as a DJ with RadioNow 100.9 and 
Hot 96.3. As a local businessman, Ron co- 
founded Crush Entertainment, a midwestern 
management group, and owned the Casba 
Bar where he hosted ‘Reggae Sundays’ and I 
know his legacy will live on through the many 
charitable organizations he promoted and sup-
ported. 
Ron’s passing has been deeply felt by his 
family, 
friends, 
Hoosiers 
and 
colleagues 
across our country. He was a friendly and out-
going man who never hesitated to help others, 
and his passion for music and the hip-hop 
scene earned him countless fans. Today, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in recognizing the 
amazing life of Ron Miner, DJ Indiana Jones. 
His work has inspired countless individuals in 
our community, and he leaves a legacy of love 
for music and his fellow man.

RECOGNIZING THE AWARDEES OF 
THE 
16TH 
ANNUAL 
FAIRFAX 
COUNTY HISTORY CONFERENCE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Fairfax County History Commis-
sion on the occasion of the 16th Annual Fair-
fax County History Conference. 
Since 1969, the Fairfax County History 
Commission has worked to identify, document, 
record and preserve the historic past of our re-
gion. Few areas in the country are as rich in 
history as ours. Indeed, the history of this re-
gion is the history of our country. The History 
Conference provides an opportunity to reflect 
on the accomplishments of the past year and 
to recognize our neighbors who have made 
significant contributions to preserving and pro-
moting our local history. Through the dedi-
cated efforts of the History Commission and 
its many volunteers, we are assured that our 
history will not be lost and will be available for 
future generations. 
This year, several of these dedicated indi-
viduals are being honored for their commit-
ment to the preservation and education of his-
tory. I am proud to include in the RECORD their 
names: 
Ms. Todi Carnes for her design, research, 
script authoring and graphic production of the 
video now currently used at Historic Huntley 
by the Fairfax County Park Authority to de-
scribe the Mt. Huntley viewshed. 
Ms. Heather Bollinger for her monthly publi-
cation of the Historic Records Center, Fairfax 
County Circuit Court (2014–present) called 
‘‘Found in the Archives’’. 
Ms. Katrina Krempasky for her 13 years of 
leadership as Manager, Historic Records Cen-
ter, Fairfax County Circuit Court (2006 through 
2019). 
Mr. John Ryan, for his work in orchestrating 
both the 2019 Shouse Village Oral History & 
Archive Project and the Village’s 50th Anniver-
sary Committee. 
The Shouse Village 50th Anniversary Com-
mittee, co-chaired by John Ryan & Mary Ann 
Hampton for their yearlong work in compiling, 
sorting and framing historical pictures and 
documents and orchestrating the anniversary, 
culminating in an Anniversary Reception and 
as such have preserved and honored the his-
toricity of this important community in Fairfax 
County. 
I commend the Fairfax County History Com-
mission for helping to ensure that the abun-
dance of history that is available to our com-
munity will be preserved far into the future. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in congratulating all the honorees and 
thanking the Fairfax County History Commis-
sion for the important work they do for the 
Northern Virginia community. 
HONORING MR. GILBERT CARL 
MAYS 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. Gilbert 
Carl Mays in honor of his 100th birthday. A 
distinguished man, Mr. Mays selflessly served 
our nation as a Navy pilot and flew two mis-
sions as a torpedo bomber in World War II. 
Mr. Mays has valiantly carried on the storied 
tradition of courage, service and faithfulness 
that characterizes our Armed Forces. A grad-
uate of North Carolina State University, Mr. 
Mays has for decades remained an avid sup-
porter of Wolfpack sports, an active member 
in his church and a leader in his local Kiwanis 
Club, receiving perfect attendance for many 
consecutive years. Mr. Mays even drove him-
self to the polls this past election to carry out 
his civic duty to our nation. His extraordinary 
commitment and dedication to his community 
serves as an example for us all. Mr. Mays has 
lived a life full of faith, service and we owe 
him our utmost gratitude and admiration. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
the legacy of this incredible and selfless man 
and wishing Mr. Mays a happy 100th birthday.

HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ms. Danusia Hubah of the 
U.S. Department of State, upon her comple-
tion of the Brookings Institution’s LEGIS Con-
gressional Fellowship. Assigned to my office 
for the 2020 calendar year, Ms. Hubah quickly 
became an integral part of my team, lending 
her expertise as a U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security professional to guide and inform 
my work in Congress. She will certainly be 
missed after an exceptional year of service. 
Ms. Hubah is a native of San Pedro, Cali-
fornia, and holds a Master of Arts in Inter-
national Security Studies from Georgetown 
University. She earned a Bachelor of Arts in 
Political Science and International Relations 
from the University of California, San Diego. 
Ms. Hubah has devoted her entire adult life 
to public service. With nearly two decades of 
foreign policy experience, she has held nu-
merous positions at home and abroad, includ-
ing the U.S. National Security Council, the 
U.S. Department of State, and U.S. embassies 
and consulates across the Middle East. Her 
knowledge and deep understanding of issues 
pertaining particularly to the Middle East have 
been invaluable. 
This moment is bittersweet, as we are deep-
ly saddened to see Ms. Hubah go. However, 
she has a bright future and we are excited for 
what awaits her. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. Con-
gress and a grateful Nation, I extend our 
deepest appreciation to Ms. Danusia Hubah 
for her dedicated service to the U.S. Depart-
ment of State, U.S. House of Representatives, 
and to our Nation.

tions of those honored this year, and I extend

HONORING DEBRA DELAET AS

HON. CYNTHIA AXNE

Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in honoring Professor Debra DeLaet, the Ex-
ecutive Director of the Iowa United Nations 
Association (UNA), for her dedication to pro-
tecting human rights and ending violence 
against women. 
November 25th marks the United Nation’s 
International Day for the Elimination of Vio-
lence against Women, a day devoted to bring-
ing awareness to intimate partner violence,

sexual violence and harassment, human traf-
ficking, and more. Professor DeLaet has been 
passionate about gender equality and human 
rights from a young age. She developed her 
passion for international relations and global 
issues of human rights during her time at the 
University of Notre Dame where she received 
her master’s in Peace Studies. She began 
teaching at Drake University in 1995, leading 
courses ranging from human rights to world 
politics. 
In 2019, Professor DeLaet was brought on 
as the Executive Director of the Iowa UNA, a 
non-profit, nonpartisan organization that fo-
cuses on advocating for constructive U.S. 
global engagements and supporting the work 
of the UN. It is in this position that Professor 
DeLaet has been able to advocate for change 
on a larger scale. Gender equality and wom-
en’s rights are two of the main focuses of the 
Iowa UNA, and Professor DeLaet takes pride 
in the organization’s work which has focused 
on everything from refugees and human rights 
to female empowerment and environmental 
issues. 
In addition to teaching college students, 
Professor DeLaet speaks to young people 
about the Iowa UNA and the importance of 
caring about global issues. She encourages 
students to get involved so they can be advo-
cates for their own future, as well as for the 
future of Iowa and our country. Many current 
Iowa UNA members have been involved for 
decades, some since their charter in 1953. 
The longtime membership of many in the Iowa 
UNA inspires Professor DeLaet to remain re-
silient and tenacious, and their dedication to 
the important work of the UN shows the uni-
versality of the issues the Iowa UNA focus on. 
Professor DeLaet’s dedication to human 
rights, especially pertaining to women, is in-
credibly inspiring. She has been a lifelong ad-
vocate for equality among all people, and she 
continues to teach the next generation of lead-
ers to support human rights and global in-
volvement. Professor DeLaet hopes to see a 
new generation of Iowans get involved in the 
Iowa UNA and champion important issues 
such as gender equity. I am proud of the work 
that she and the Iowa UNA have done to con-
tinue these important discussions and stand 
up for decency and equality. Professor Debra 
DeLaet’s many years of dedication and pas-
sion are exactly why we are inspired by her, 
and why I am honored to recognize her as our 
Iowan of the Week.

RECOGNIZING COLONEL WILLIAM 
F. MCCOLLOUGH 
HON. GREGORY F. MURPHY 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Colonel William 
Ferree McCollough, United States Marine 
Corps, for his 30 years of service to our great 
nation and his family’s faithful service as well. 
Colonel McCollough is a 1991 graduate of 
Norwich 
University 
where 
he 
graduated 
summa cum laude and was nominated for a 
prestigious Rhodes Scholarship. The theme of 
his distinguished career has been one of 
achievement with highest honors throughout 
his three decades of unconditional service to 
the United States of America. 
Literally every military school he attended, 
he distinguished himself by graduating with 
honors, which is an absolutely tremendous 
achievement. The schools he attained these 
high honors at are the Basic Officers’ Course, 
the Amphibious Warfare School and the Ma-
rine Corps War College. 
His deployments have been more numerous 
than most Marines. As a young officer, he was 
assigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines where 
he deployed twice to Okinawa. In 1995, he 
was assigned to the elite Fleet Anti-Terrorist 
Security Team Company where he was in-
volved in human trafficking interdiction oper-
ations working with the United States Coast 
Guard (USCG). One operation led him and his 
Marines to interdict a foreign freighter in the 
Atlantic that was carrying Chinese slave labor-
ers. They assisted the USCG by ensuring the 
laborers were freed and their kidnappers were 
captured and brought to justice. 
In 2002, Colonel McCollough was selected 
for the highly prestigious Marine Corps Con-
gressional Fellowship. This selection entailed 
working in the hallowed halls of the U.S. Con-
gress for a year in a congressional office. The 
competition for this program is very keen. 
Once again, he excelled, which led him to his 
current assignment as the Director of the Ma-
rine liaison office to the House of Representa-
tives. 
In 2006, then Major McCollough deployed to 
Iraq as a Military Transition Team leader. He 
and his team worked advising an Iraqi military 
unit. During one engagement, his unit came 
under fire from 122mm mortars where he sus-
tained wounds and was awarded a Purple 
Heart. 
Colonel McCollough has received a Legion 
of Merit with a ‘‘V’’ device for valor or heroism 
in combat. This was awarded when he was 
the Commanding Officer of 1st Battalion, 5th 
Marines for the battle to seize the Nawa dis-
trict in Afghanistan from the Taliban. 
Colonel McCollough also has received the 
Bronze Star with a ‘‘V’’ device for leading the 
advisor element with an Iraqi Army unit in 
2006. Colonel McCollough had several combat 
deployments. There were two to Iraq (2006 
and 2008). There were two to Afghanistan 
(2009 and 2013/14) and one also to Iraq, Jor-
dan, Kuwait and other undisclosed locations. 
He served on the Joint Staff in the Pen-
tagon. There his vast experiences in Middle 
East operations was used to help formulate fu-
ture plans in the region. Additionally, Colonel 
McCollough was deployed in support of Oper-
ation Inherent Resolve in 2015 and 2016. This 
military operation is ongoing, with the goal to 
eradicate terrorists in the countries of Iraq, 
Syria and Libya. 
Colonel McCollough has received combat 
action ribbons in two theaters of war—Iraq 
and Afghanistan where he was engaged in 
multiple combat actions. 
Colonel McCollough’s final tour in the Ma-
rine Corps is with us once again in the hal-
lowed halls of Congress. During his tenure as 
the Director of the House Marine Liaison Of-
fice, Colonel McCollough has led the Marine 
Corps’ efforts to modernize the Marine Corps 
and prepare our Corps for future wars. His du-
ties have taken him to six continents and mul-
tiple countries supporting both the U.S. House 
of Representatives and the Marine Corps. 
Colonel McCollough has served 30 out-
standing years to our beloved nation and will 
retire on 1 June 2021. His wife, Caroline, and 
sons Jack and Hunter deserve recognition too 
because their support for Colonel McCollough 
has been unwavering. They have lived 
through 10 moves and the extended absences 
of Colonel McCollough’s many deployments. 
Their courage and determination are note-
worthy. 
I am delighted to have this opportunity to 
recognize not only Colonel McCollough, but 
his entire family for their undeniably incredible 
service to the U.S. Marine Corps and our 
great nation. Their sacrifice and dedication to 
our nation is truly remarkable. I wish his be-
loved wife, Caroline, and their two sons Jack 
and Hunter, well, as all of them embark on a 
new chapter in their lives. God bless the 
McColloughs, God bless the United States of 
America, and Semper Fidelis.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. ED 
HELTON 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor and pleasure to extend my con-
gratulations to a gifted educator, great team 
builder, loving husband, father, grandfather, 
and friend of longstanding, Dr. Ed Helton. Dr. 
Helton will retire from Columbus State Univer-
sity (CSU) on Wednesday, December 16, 
2020, after a distinguished career that cul-
minated in his selection as Interim Chief of 
Staff for the University. 
Dr. Ed Helton earned a Bachelor of Arts in 
Communication and English and a Master of 
Arts in Philosophy and Religion from Samford 
University, and a Doctor of Divinity from 
Judson College. He has been a student of 
leadership development and communication 
throughout his career. In addition to his edu-
cational achievements, Dr. Helton completed 
the Executive Education course, The Art and 
Practice of Leadership Development, at Har-
vard University’s John F. Kennedy School of 
Government in May of 2013. And in March 
2015, he attended Minds at Work’s Immunity 
to Change (ITC) instrument training in Cam-
bridge, Massachusetts. 
For almost two decades, Dr. Helton has 
been a highly trusted leader in the higher edu-
cation sector. He built quite an impressive ca-
reer, which began in 2002 when he became 
an Adjunct Professor in Philosophy at CSU. In 
2004, in addition to his teaching duties, Dr. 
Helton started serving as a consultant with 
CSU’s Leadership Institute, where he became 
instrumental in promoting the Institute. In May 
2005, he assumed the position as Director of 
the Leadership Institute at the Cunningham 
Center 
for 
Leadership 
Development. 
Dr. 
Helton played an integral part in the Jim Blan-
chard Leadership Forum that brought distin-
guished leaders to Columbus, Georgia such 
as Former President George W. Bush, Former 
First Lady Laura Bush, Former Secretary of 
State Condoleezza Rice, Dallas Mavericks 
Owner Mark Cuban, and Dr. Mae Jemison, 
among others. 
A man of many talents, Dr. Helton is cer-
tified by several leadership organizations that 
qualifies him as an expert on team building, 
conflict resolution, and human behavior. Ed is 
also an ordained minister whose spiritual in-
sights inform his extraordinary ability to under-
stand the strengths and weaknesses of the 
human character. He has also lent his time 
and talents to serve as a consultant and key-
note speaker for a wide range of other organi-
zations. 
Winston Churchill once said: ‘‘You make 
your living by what you get, you make your life 
by what you give.’’ Dr. Ed Helton has given so 
much to Columbus State University, his com-
munity, his friends, and most importantly, his 
God. Ed has cast a wide net in his service to 
humankind, and the world is a better place be-
cause of his work. 
Ed has accomplished much in his life, but 
none of this would have been possible without 
the Grace of God and the love and support of 
his wife, Lana, and his son, Brett. 
On a personal note, Ed has had a signifi-
cant impact on my life, both personally and 
professionally. He has offered sage advice 
and counsel as a consultant and has often 
been a sounding board for me when grappling 
with thorny issues. His ability to balance cri-
tique and encouragement in a way that is con-
structive in achieving a positive outcome is ex-
ceptional. I will be forever grateful for his pro-
fessional guidance and his friendship. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join my wife, Viv-
ian, and me along with the more than 730,000 
residents of the Second Congressional Dis-
trict, in extending our sincerest appreciation 
and best wishes to Dr. Ed Helton upon the oc-
casion of his retirement from an outstanding 
career in Higher Education Administration and 
his continued service to humanity.

ROB STRAIN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the career of Rob Strain, a 
friend and constituent who is retiring as Presi-
dent of Ball Aerospace headquartered in Colo-
rado. 
Rob first joined Ball Aerospace in 2012 after 
serving as Director of NASA’s Goddard Space 
Flight Center. At Goddard, Rob’s strong over-
sight and leadership skills contributed to the 
success of more than 13 missions as he was 
able to blend technical and programmatic so-
lutions while under intense Congressional and 
agency scrutiny. Rob has a hands-on mana-
gerial style and collaborative nature which 
makes him a critical contributor on mission 
teams and not just the person in charge. 
Rob helped devise and execute a smooth 
transition from the flawed tri-agency NPOESS 
program for the Nation’s next generation polar 
weather satellites to the NASA-NOAA Joint 
Polar Satellite System (JPSS) based at God-
dard to ensure the continuity of these critical 
weather satellite observations. The signifi-
cance of his thoughtful, effective leadership 
during the program’s transition cannot be 
overstated. 
Rob also served a key role for the final 
Space Shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble 
Space Telescope. The mission encountered a 
major programmatic challenge from a pre- 
launch computer failure one month before the 
scheduled launch. In this ‘‘failure is not an op-
tion’’ moment, Rob brought together the gov-
ernment and industry expertise to fix the prob-
lem, ensured the team stayed on track, and 
minimized schedule impacts. The result was a 
successful 
servicing 
mission, 
extending 
Hubble’s incredible contributions to our sci-
entific community as we approach 31 years in 
service. 
Prior to joining NASA, Rob led the Space 
Department of the Johns Hopkins Applied 
Physics Laboratory, where he was integral to 
the successful development, launch and oper-
ations of the New Horizons spacecraft to 
Pluto. New Horizons overcame numerous 
technical and instrument availability issues to 
meet an extremely tight planetary launch win-
dow and successfully flew by Pluto in 2015. 
Through his career at Ball Aerospace, Rob 
has been a strong champion for diversity and 
inclusion across his teams and empowering all 
members of the team to be themselves and 
contribute to the success of the business and 
the mission. Despite the success Rob has 
achieved in his career, he remains an incred-
ibly approachable and humble person. Rob re-
mains accessible to individuals at all career 
levels, actively seeking their input and making 
them feel valued. 
I will miss Rob, for his dry sense of humor 
which often brought levity to serious meetings 
and tense situations. I thank him for his friend-
ship and his work on behalf of the aerospace 
community, Colorado and the Nation. I wish 
him the best in his retirement.

CONGRATULATING 
THE

REGIONAL 
ALCOHOL 
PROGRAM AND THE 2020 LAW EN-
FORCEMENT AWARD OF EXCEL-
LENCE RECIPIENTS 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Washington Regional Alcohol 
Program (WRAP) and their continued dedica-
tion to the elimination of impaired driving and 
underage drinking in the Washington metro-
politan area. 
WRAP is a public-private partnership that 
works with law enforcement, community stake-
holders, and advocacy groups in Northern Vir-
ginia, 
Washington, 
D.C., 
and 
Maryland. 
Through educational and innovative public 
programs, WRAP is credited with keeping 
Washington area alcohol related death rates 
historically below the national average. Pro-
grams and resources include Youth Outreach, 
Adult Outreach, and Public Education pro-
grams designed to educate students and the 
general public on the dangers of alcohol and 
drugs, particularly driving while under the influ-
ence. WRAP offers unique programs such as 
the WRAP Holiday SoberRide program, where 
individuals who are impaired can request a 
free safe ride home. 
In 1982, the year that WRAP was founded, 
26,173 people in the United States lost their 
lives in alcohol-related car crashes; 60 percent 
of all traffic fatalities involved drunk driving. 
Due to the tireless efforts of WRAP, other or-
ganizations such as MADD and SADD, local 
and state police, and enforcement of more 
stringent anti-drunk driving laws, alcohol-re-
lated traffic fatalities decreased to 9,878. 
WRAP continues to work tirelessly to ensure 
these statistics are not repeated. In fiscal year 
2020, WRAP was successful in removing 
2,243 potential drunk drivers from Greater 
Washington’s roadways during only two, pre- 
COVID WRAP SoberRide campaigns. WRAP 
also experienced a record level of ridership for 
Halloween which was the highest in Sober 
Ride’s 27–year history. In addition, WRAP 
reached the ‘‘80,000–served’’ level of total rid-
ership for its Sober Ride program; in fact, total

HONORING THE LIFE OF EARL 
LEROY ASHE, JR. 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to take pause and reflect on the life of Earl 
Leroy Ashe, Jr. 
Earl Ashe was born on February 8, 1933. 
As a teenager, he joined the Army and later 
became a member of the 82nd Airborne Divi-
sion. 
Following Earl’s discharge from the military, 
he went on to attend North Carolina State Uni-
versity and later graduated from the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree 
in English. 
It was after his graduation from college, 
Madam Speaker, that Earl Ashe became a 
pioneer in the early days of television. He first 
started at several small television stations and 
then moved to Raleigh, North Carolina where 
he helped launch WRAL. 
During his career at WRAL, Earl produced 
and directed the daily news, the Uncle Paul 
children’s show, local wrestling, and many 
other shows and commercials. While with 
WRAL, Earl met and befriended the future 
Senator Jesse Helms. 
Years later he joined Senator Helms to 
write, produce, and direct commercials for his 
senatorial campaigns. Earl was a trendsetter 
in campaign ad production; creating effective 
ads that moved public opinion and had a last-
ing impact on the state of North Carolina. So 
effective, in fact, that he also helped write ad-
vertisements for Senators’ John East and 
Lauch Faircloth. 
Earl was known for his love of jazz music 
from the 1950s and 1960s and his plethora of 
opinions relating to foreign affairs, the military, 
and the overall direction of our country. And, 
Madam Speaker, Earl’s storytelling was that of 
legend. 
Sadly, however, Earl Ashe passed away on 
November 12, 2020. He is deeply missed by 
his friends, family, and the entire community.

remember the life of Robert H. Brothers, of 
Howland, Ohio, who passed away on Friday, 
December 4, 2020 at the age of 89. 
Mr. Brothers was born in Warren, Ohio on 
August 11, 1931, the son of Gerald E. and 
Alta Lucille (Pfile) Brothers. 
Bob was a 1949 graduate of Warren G. 
Harding High School and remained in contact 
with many of the 49ers’ classmates. He 
worked at Republic Steel, Bridgeport Brass 
and retired in 1991 from Packard Electric. 
Soon after graduating, Bob served in the 
United States Army, 1st Cavalry Division, in 
Japan. His division was one of the first to land 
in Korea in July 1950. Bob received many 
decorations and citations for his brave and 
honorable service. 
Bob was the Past Commander American 
Legion, William McKinley Post No. 106, Niles, 
Ohio; Korean War Veterans Association, 
Chapter 137 of the Mahoning Valley; Chair-
man of Korean War Veterans ‘‘Tell America’’ 
program; Committee to fund and erect Korean 
War Memorial in the Mahoning Valley; Chap-
lain for Trumbull County American Legion 
Honor Guard; Trumbull County Veterans Serv-
ice Commissioner; Veterans Affairs Volunteer; 
Niles Church for Housing; Interfaith Churches 
for 
Housing; 
Niles 
Churches 
Community 
Meals; Niles First Christian Church; Church’s 
Lenten production of ‘‘It Is Finished;’’ Niles 
Historical Society; Recipient of a Trumbull 
County Community Star in 2009; Inducted into 
the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame in 2009 and 
President of the Ohio State Association of 
County Veterans Service Commission in 2013 
to 2014. 
Left to cherish his memory are his three 
children, Ann (Rick) Bush of Millersburg, Rob-
ert Brothers of Cedar Park, Texas and David 
(Rebecca) Brothers of Niles; two grand-
children, Jenna (Owen) Grella and Ben Broth-
ers; six sisters, Barbara, Dorothy, Janet, Judy, 
Elaine and Mary Jayne; brother, Gerald and 
sister-in-law, Marilyn Brothers. 
He was preceded in death by the love of his 
life, Virginia F. (O’Reilly) Brothers, whom he 
married on August 29, 1953 and who died on 
April 26, 2010; grandson, Andrew Bush and 
six brothers, William, David, Wayne, Eugene, 
James and Kenneth. 
It was obvious to all who knew him that Bob 
was a hardworking and dedicated man who 
deeply loved our country and was a strong ad-
vocate for all those who served. I thank Mr. 
Brothers for his service to our country and for 
his work in our community. My deepest sym-
pathies to Bob’s family and to all whose lives 
he touched.

HONORING KATHRIN (KATE) SEARS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Kathrin (Kate) Sears for 
her outstanding career in public service as 
Marin County’s District 3 Supervisor. 
Kate has been a resident of Southern Marin 
for most of her life, and it is the place where 
she developed the principled values that have 
guided her private and public careers. 
She earned a bachelor’s degree in Asian 
studies at Carleton College in Minnesota, a 
master’s degree in Chinese studies at the Uni-
versity of Washington, a doctorate in political 
science from the University of Michigan, and a 
law degree from Harvard University. In 2005, 
after working as an attorney in a private prac-
tice for 16 years, Kate joined the Consumer 
Law Section of the California Attorney Gen-
eral’s Office. In 2011 Governor Jerry Brown 
appointed Kate to the Marin County Board of 
Supervisors after the heartbreaking death of 
long-standing Supervisor Hal Brown. She was 
reelected in 2012 and 2016. 
Throughout her tenure on the Board of Su-
pervisors, Kate represented the residents of 
Marin, its renowned public lands and the envi-
ronment with passion and skill. She worked to 
improve public transportation, strengthen serv-
ices for older adults, and increase affordable 
housing opportunities. Kate has helped to plan 
and implement key Marin initiatives including 
BayWAVE and Drawdown: Marin. As Chair of 
Marin Clean Energy, Kate worked to develop 
energy efficiency programs and expanded 
electric vehicle charging stations in Marin. 
From Angel Island to Muir Woods, Kate has 
also fought for Marin’s parks and open 
spaces. I am proud to have worked with her 
to find compromise in resolving community 
issues, including through the Muir Woods 
Parking Reservation System. 
Kate is a champion for the people and 
places of Marin County and leaves an appre-
ciable legacy as she retires from the Board of 
Supervisors. Madam Speaker, I respectfully 
ask that you join me in honoring Kate for an 
accomplished tenure, and extend to her best 
wishes in her future endeavors. 
RECOGNIZING COMMANDER 
MARCUS L. JONES 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Commander Marcus L. 
Jones of the U.S. Navy, upon his completion 
of the Department of Defense Legislative Fel-
lowship program. Assigned to my office for the 
2020 calendar year, Commander Jones quick-
ly became an integral part of my team, lending 
his expertise as a U.S. Navy Supply Corps Of-
ficer to guide and inform my work as Chair-
man of the Readiness Subcommittee within 
the House Armed Services Committee. Over 
this past year, Commander Jones has worked 
closely with my personal staff and Readiness 
Subcommittee staff on the military’s most 
pressing readiness challenges. He will be 
deeply missed after an exceptional year of 
service. 
Commander Jones is a native of Columbus, 
Mississippi, and is a graduate of the University 
of Memphis with a degree in International 
Business. He also holds a Master of Business 
Administration from Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity and a Master of Science in National 
Resource Strategy from the Dwight D. Eisen-
hower School for National Security and Re-
source Strategy. 
Commander Jones began his career in 
2001, and has since held numerous oper-
ational and shore assignments including on 
the USS West Virginia (SSBN–736B) and 
USS George Washington (CVN–73), at the 
Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program, Naval 
Supply Systems Command, Naval Air Sys-
tems Command, U.S. Pacific Fleet, and in the 
office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the 
Navy for Budget. His extensive background in 
logistics has been critical to my work in 
strengthening and recapitalizing our nation’s 
maritime logistics force. 
Commander Jones and his wife, Sybil, have 
three beautiful daughters, and his family con-
tinues to support him and his service to our 
nation. 
This moment is bittersweet, as we are deep-
ly saddened to see Commander Jones go. 
However, we are excited for what awaits him 
and what his future holds. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the U.S. Con-
gress and a grateful Nation, I extend our 
deepest appreciation to Commander Marcus 
L. Jones for his dedicated service to the U.S. 
Navy, U.S. House of Representatives, and to 
our Nation.

RECOGNIZING 
RUSSELL 
BRYANT 
FOR 44 YEARS OF MILITARY AND 
CIVIL SERVICE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Russell Bryant for his 44 
years of selfless service to our nation and to 
congratulate him on his upcoming retirement. 
Mr. Bryant attended Rensselaer Polytechnic 
Institute, receiving a ROTC scholarship after 
his first semester. Though he initially studied 
Aeronautical Engineering, he switched to Nu-
clear Engineering following his ROTC mid-
shipman cruise. After obtaining his Bachelor of 
Engineering in Nuclear Engineering, he re-
ceived his commission as an Ensign in the 
United States Navy on May 13, 1976. 
He was first stationed on the USS Mis-
sissippi and later served on both the USS 
South Carolina CGN–37 and the USS Texas 
CGN–39, serving in various capacities of in-
creasing responsibility. Mr. Bryant left active 
duty on September 30, 1987, at which time he 
held the position of Ship Maintenance Man-
ager for the USS Carl Vinson CVN 70 on the 
Commander Naval Air Forces Pacific Fleet 
Staff in San Diego, VA. His active duty awards 
include Meritorious Unit Commendation and 
the Naval Expeditionary Medal, and two Sea 
Service ribbons. After his discharge from ac-
tive duty, he joined the Naval Reserves where 
he served with distinction, again earning nu-
merous medals and awards. 
Mr. Bryant continued his service to our na-
tion beginning November 11, 1987, as a civil 
servant in the Aircraft Carrier Program Office, 
PMS 312, of the Naval Sea Systems Com-
mand. In 1994, he took a new position in the 
Program Executive Office for Ship Self De-
fense Systems (PEO SSDS), which is now the 
Program Executive Office for Integrated War-
fare Systems. Mr. Bryant has contributed 
greatly to the Navy through his involvement in 
the realm of electronic warfare and decoys 
from 1994 to present day. 
Even while balancing the demands of a top- 
level civil service position and his responsibil-
ities in the U.S. Naval Reserves, Mr. Bryant 
still found the time to complete courses at the 
Naval War College, receiving his diploma in 
1997. He also completed the USDA Executive 
Potential Program and was recognized as the 
Outstanding Alumni for 2000. He went on to 
take other graduate level courses and re-
ceived his Master of Arts in National Security 
and Strategic Studies from the Naval War Col-
lege in 2003. A recognized expert in various 
aspects of technical, social and organizational 
components of Command and Control, Mr. 
Bryant has published numerous peer-reviewed 
papers since 2000. 
Mr. Bryant has also contributed to his local 
community. He served as his Prince William 
County Supervisor’s Budget Advisory Com-
mittee Chair for two years. He subsequently 
served as Prince William County Woodbridge 
District Planning Commissioner, advising the 
Prince William County Board of Supervisors 
on land use and development issues in the 
County. Mr. Bryant remained in this position 
until December 31, 2018 after serving on the 
commission for 16 years, including 12 as 
Chairman. 
At the end of December 2020, Mr. Bryant 
will retire following 44 years of exemplary 
service as a Naval Officer and a Civil Servant. 
I congratulate Mr. Bryant and commend him 
for his outstanding service to the protection of 
our great nation and the betterment of our 
local community. Madam Speaker, I ask that 
my colleagues join me in congratulating Rus-
sell Bryant on his retirement and in wishing 
him and his wife Janelle continued health, 
happiness and success.

IN HONOR OF CATHERINE ‘‘CAT’’ 
CARLTON 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, December 15, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker and mem-
bers, I rise today to recognize Catherine 
Carlton, known as ‘‘Cat’’ by her community, for 
her eight years of service on the city council 
of Menlo Park. It’s been a remarkable time for 
this native of Tarrant County, Texas, who 
eventually made her way west to lead her dy-
namic community astride San Francisco Bay. 
Catherine graduated with a Bachelors in 
Rhetoric and Public Communications from 
Tulane University and received her MBA at 
the Cass Business School in London where 
she was president of her class and graduated 
with Deans Honors. She worked in Hong Kong 
for 10 years for, among others, Equant and for 
a company that she founded and managed— 
Search Bank. During her global business ca-
reer, she has worked at eight different compa-
nies. 
Menlo Park is a community of 35,000. Its 
daytime population swells by thousands as 
high technology employees stream into glob-
ally 
competitive 
businesses, 
including 
Facebook. After moving to town, Catherine be-
came immersed in her new community. 
Catherine was appointed to the parks and 
recreation commission in 2009 and served 
until elected to the city council in 2012. She 
joined as the Great Recession and its impact 
on city finances ebbed. In 2012, local measure 
K passed. It increased the hotel occupancy 
tax. Ultimately, these revenues and others 
made possible upgrades to the city’s parks 
and libraries, among several other worthy ini-
tiatives supported by Catherine. 
With the explosive expansion of Facebook 
and other high technology companies, Cath-
erine and her colleagues were repeatedly 
called upon to guide the community’s growth 
so that it did not overwhelm residents. For ex-
ample, when a major project at Willow Road 
and Highway 101 commenced, Catherine and 
the council tried to ensure that it concluded as 
quickly as possible. It was a huge thread-the- 
needle project with long lines of cars slowly 
snaking in various directions over many 
months. While the end result is a great inter-
change, Catherine spent many hours of coun-
cil time listening to nearby neighbors. She and 
her colleagues worked hard to reduce nega-
tive impacts when possible. 
During her time on the council, Catherine 
represented Menlo Park on twelve regional 
committees or agencies. These included the 
Peninsula Clean Energy Authority, C/CAG, the 
Airport Community Roundtable, and an ad hoc 
council committees on parking. 
She is a passionate advocate for local busi-
nesses. Now, with the pandemic restricting 
many downtown merchants, Catherine and her 
colleagues are adapting Menlo Park so that 
dining in downtown streets is possible. Pedes-
trians and bicyclists (walking their bikes) sup-
port restaurants and merchants. 
We often hear the expression, ‘‘Out of the 
frying pan, into the fire.’’ It would be simple to 
describe sitting on the Menlo Park council 
from 2012 to the present in those terms given 
the yin and yang of long-running explosive job 
growth followed by pandemic-induced restric-
tions. However, this would be an incomplete 
picture. Many wonderful things happened over 
the past eight years under Cat’s leadership 
and guidance. 
The city is revitalized with longtime vacant 
lots on the El Camino Real sporting new office 
buildings. Parks are refreshed, the libraries 
upgraded, and long-needed infrastructure in-
vestments were made. Crime—never a signifi-
cant problem in Menlo Park—remains low. 
Issues related to community-wide planning 
were dealt with. The city’s schools remain 
strong and its families treasure the environ-
ment, including its bayfront park and tree 
canopied streets. 
A mother of two young children, Catherine 
and George, Cat helped run her daughter’s 
Girl Scout troop and volunteered with AYSO. 
She was the vice president of her home-
owner’s association and served on the board 
of the Vista Center for the Blind and Visually 
Impaired. She volunteered as an after-school 
tutor. Her volunteer work for the Junior 
League led to her support of Project Read, 
Foster Families and HIP Housing. She was a 
board member and past president of the Las 
Lomitas Education Foundation. She worked 
with state legislators on legislation to address 
human trafficking and domestic violence. In 
all, she served as a volunteer with over nine 
nonprofits or associations dealing with local 
and state subjects touching youth, women, 
and quality-of-life issues. 
Catherine Carlton has played an important 
role in all of these achievements. Now she, 
husband Robert Ridenour, and their children 
will have more time together. This is likely wel-
comed by everyone in the family after years of 
her intense dedication to neighbors and to the 
future of the community that she loves. I was 
honored to know and to work with Catherine 
Carlton, and I wish her all the best in the 
years ahead.
