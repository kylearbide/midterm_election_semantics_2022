KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
the aftermath of Western Kentucky’s 
devastating tornado outbreak, I have 
maintained close contact with State 
and local officials. My staff has been on 
the ground since the outset of the cri-
sis, helping residents access Federal re-
sources and keeping me up-to-date 
with any developments. Toward the 
end of the week, I will travel back to 
Kentucky to meet with my constitu-
ents and visit the areas affected. 
The stories coming out of Kentucky 
are harrowing. But in recent days, we 
also heard about the generosity, the 
hard work, and the hope that are help-
ing our State recover. 
Kentuckians desperately need help to 
rebuild, so our universities, normally 
bitter rivals on the court, are rallying 
together to raise money and gather 
supplies for relief efforts. 
This Christmas is shaping up to be 
exceptionally difficult for children all 
across Western Kentucky, so churches

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9168 
December 15, 2021 
are organizing toy drives to help make 
the holidays a little bit brighter. West-
ern Kentucky community organiza-
tions are stretched to the limit, so 
businesses 
based 
in 
the 
Common-
wealth, from distilleries to car manu-
facturers, 
to 
insurance 
companies, 
have stepped up and donated literally 
millions. Remarkable stories of sur-
vival and resiliency have trickled out 
of the disaster zone. 
Last 
weekend’s 
storm 
destroyed 
much of the First Christian Church in 
Mayfield, but the congregation discov-
ered their communion table and altar 
cross 
fully 
intact 
while 
picking 
through the rubble. A symbol of hope 
and rebirth survived amid so much 
pain. 
Across town, the Mayfield Health and 
Rehabilitation nursing home was phys-
ically devastated when it took a direct 
hit from the tornado on Friday night, 
but all 74 of the facility’s elderly resi-
dents survived with only minor inju-
ries. As one staff member said, this was 
‘‘truly a miracle.’’ 
And in Bremen, KY, when a man vis-
ited the wreckage of his home on Sat-
urday, he discovered his grand piano 
mostly 
undamaged—undamaged—de-
spite the storm. Amid the surrounding 
devastation, he sat down to play and to 
sing hymns. His songs, shared on social 
media, warmed the hearts of thou-
sands. 
These stories of hope have ricocheted 
across the Commonwealth, bringing 
smiles and strength to communities 
that need them most. And they give me 
faith that Kentucky will recover from 
this crisis stronger than ever. 
S. 1605 
Now, Mr. President, on an entirely 
different matter, today, the Senate will 
pass this year’s National Defense Au-
thorization Act by a big bipartisan 
margin. 
I have talked for weeks about the im-
portance of this legislation, given the 
global threats and international chal-
lenges that face our country from 
China to Russia, to the fight against 
terrorists in the Middle East. 
I will also be proud to vote for this 
bill because of the enormous impact it 
will have on my home State. The proud 
servicemembers based in Kentucky 
play an outsized role in our national 
defense. From deploying across the 
world to fighting COVID–19 here at 
home, they do amazing work to keep 
America safe. 
In the past week, they have stepped 
up to provide critical support as Ken-
tucky deals with the aftermath of our 
devastating tornadoes. Our Common-
wealth’s heroes and their families de-
serve our full support, and I am proud 
that this year’s National Defense Au-
thorization Act delivers for them. 
Nearly $1 billion for the Assembled 
Chemical Weapon’s Alternative Pro-
gram that supports the chemical muni-
tions destruction mission at the Blue 
Grass Army Depot; robust funding to 
deter Russia in Europe; the emission of 
Fort Knox’s Fifth Corps Headquarters; 
continued investments in research and 
modernization that will guarantee our 
soldiers, including those at Fort Camp-
bell, are prepared to counter emerging 
threats like China. 
We have also built on our previous ef-
forts to lift up Kentucky’s military 
families. The bill provides additional 
funding 
for 
modern, 
high-quality 
childcare facilities, including $27 mil-
lion for a new childcare development 
center at Fort Knox. It authorizes an 
across-the-board 2.7-percent pay raise 
for our troops. 
This bill is critically important to 
the servicemembers who make im-
mense sacrifices to keep our Nation 
safe. I am proud to support it and help 
cement the Commonwealth’s role as 
America’s 
most 
military-friendly 
State. 
INFLATION 
Mr. President, now one final matter, 
I described yesterday how inflation is 
hurting families all across our country. 
Since then, yet another key economic 
indicator 
has 
set 
an 
unfortunate 
record. 
In the last year, wholesale prices 
grew at their fastest pace on record. 
Anyone with a shred of sense knows 
this is the absolute wrong time—wrong 
time—to unleash a multitrillion-dollar 
taxing-and-spending spree. 
Every single day brings new evidence 
our Democratic colleagues should give 
the country a break. But the cost of 
Washington Democrats’ latest obses-
sion isn’t the only problem. The con-
text of what they want to pass is actu-
ally just as bad. 
We have known since the start of the 
COVID pandemic that Democrats saw 
it as an opportunity to transform 
American society. They have actually 
been quite candid about that. And their 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
they are writing behind closed doors is 
a Trojan horse to let the radical left 
dictate intimate details to American 
families. 
There is a long list of policies in-
spired by the authors of the Green New 
Deal. A whole slew of new programs 
and mandates are aimed at fitting the 
entire country’s systems for producing 
and consuming energy into sort of a 
California-shaped box: special subsidies 
for expensive lifestyle choices like 
electric vehicles and electric bicycles; 
new redtape to strangle the most reli-
able and affordable sources of Amer-
ican energy; subsidies for supply chains 
that China dominates so that America 
borrows in order to ‘‘Build Back Bei-
jing’’; and don’t forget the so-called Ci-
vilian Climate Corps, just what we 
need at a time of inflation and labor 
shortages—a 
Potemkin 
make-work 
program for liberal activists. 
Of course, Washington Democrats in-
tend to grab greater control over the 
development of America’s young people 
long before they are eligible for made- 
up green jobs. Their spree contains a 
massive ‘‘toddler takeover’’ that in-
sults the diversity of American fami-
lies and their aspirations. It only 
throws money at a subset of secular 
childcare centers that woke bureau-
crats happen to favor. 
Forget faith-based options, forget 
flexible part-time arrangements, forget 
being remotely fair to families with a 
parent at home, Democrats want to 
bring their inflation into childcare and 
make daycare more expensive, more in-
flexible, and more unfair. 
And then there is the latest offensive 
in a long campaign to restrict more of 
American’s healthcare choices. Demo-
crats’ plan would mean more one-size- 
fits-all programs, more government 
control, a wet blanket over the world- 
leading innovation pipeline that cre-
ates new cures, and a further gamble 
with seniors’ Medicare when the trust 
fund is already in danger of insolvency. 
Then there are the massive tax hikes 
our colleagues want to use to cover the 
bill—all those radical changes, all 
those Big Government intrusions into 
family life, compared with the crush-
ing tax hikes that would hit our coun-
try like a ton of bricks. 
There are new surcharges on indi-
vidual taxpayers. There are tax hikes 
for passthrough businesses. There is a 
brandnew, radical scheme to make 
American industry less competitive 
that Senate Democrats scribbled down 
with no hearings or committee process. 
President 
Biden 
promised 
he 
wouldn’t raise taxes one penny on any-
one making less than $400,000. But ex-
perts agree that Democrats’ tax hikes 
would break that promise. People with 
far less income would be affected. 
So for goodness’ sake, in 2022, their 
bill would give a bigger percentage tax 
cut to people making more than $1 mil-
lion every year than the families that 
pull in between $75,000 and $100,000. 
That is according to the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation. 
The average person who makes up-
ward of $1 million gets a bigger tax 
break—a bigger tax break—from Demo-
crats’ bill than the average household 
that makes just under—just under—six 
figures. 
In large part, that is because of an 
absurdly expensive tax giveaway that 
Democrats want to hand out to benefit 
high-income earners in blue States. 
Their SALT policy would make the 
Federal 
Government 
subsidize 
the 
property tax bills of people with man-
sions who choose to live in high-tax 
States. 
It is an insane proposition, and it is 
struggling to even earn support from 
Democrats’ rank and file. But their 
leaders from New York and California 
are obsessed with it, so go figure. 
But SALT is only just the beginning 
of the gravy train this bill steers to-
ward 
Democrats’ 
pet 
projects 
and 
causes. There is also a tax code tweak 
that would create a special deduction 
for union dues, while letting one for 
charitable contributions actually ex-
pire. Another special incentive—to the 
tune of $10 billion—would help liberal 
colleges and universities indoctrinate 
students in new ‘‘environmental jus-
tice’’ programs, whatever that is. Still,

others would pour $29 billion into fund-
ing a ‘‘National Green Bank,’’ $2.5 bil-
lion into increasing—listen to this— 
‘‘tree equity,’’ $1.67 billion to bail out 
news outlet, and an extra billion on top 
for ‘‘improving climate resilience’’ of 
Pacific salmon—an extra billion on top 
for ‘‘improving climate resilience’’ of 
Pacific salmon. 
And then, of course, there are the 
extra special ways Democrats want to 
use this bill to fulfill more personal 
hometown priorities. Speaker PELOSI 
didn’t end up getting to earmark mil-
lions of Federal dollars for redevel-
oping a park in her district. Ah, but 
she did secure one Congressman’s vote 
by upping the funding for a defunct re-
gional commission that largely bene-
fits his district by 13,000 percent. That 
is old-school vote-buying, a slap in the 
face to taxpayers. 
Our own colleague, the Democratic 
leader, has pledged to ‘‘use all of [his] 
power’’ to personally steer tens of bil-
lions of dollars toward a hometown 
New York City housing authority with 
a long and storied reputation of corrup-
tion, mismanagement, and scandal. 
So it is hard to wrap your head 
around all this; that is, unless you sub-
scribe to Washington Democrats’ ap-
parent core principle—core principle: 
When the American people are footing 
the bill, the menu is all-you-can-eat. 
Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
House came together with the Senate 
to raise the debt limit, which I think 
was good because another closedown of 
our government would have been disas-
trous. So I am proud, as President pro 
tempore, to sign the joint resolution 
that raises the debt limit, and that will 
go now to the President. The Speaker 
signed it, I have signed it, and now the 
President will be able to sign the bill. 
I was very, very proud to do that. 
S. 1605 
Mr. President, on another matter, we 
are going to soon have the opportunity 
to vote on passage of the fiscal year 
2022 National Defense Authorization 
Act, the NDAA. As they do every year, 
I am sure Senators will get out press 
releases touting all of the things in 
this bill that they support, as I do: a 
pay raise for the military, increases for 
medical 
research, 
investments 
to 
counter Chinese aggression. These are 
things all worth talking about, but 
let’s be honest and go beyond the rhet-
oric, tell the American people about 
what we are doing and what we are not. 
We can stand here on the Senate 
floor—we can do it back home—and de-
clare our unwavering support for our 
troops and their families, can claim to 
support a strong national defense, but 
until we put our money where our 
mouth is and provide the funding we 
say we support, then those words ring 
hollow. It is only rhetoric. 
Now, the NDAA is an important piece 
of legislation, and I applaud those Sen-
ators who put it together. It sets over-
arching policy for the Department of 
Defense. It guides our national secu-
rity. But—but—make sure people un-
derstand that what it does not do is 
provide the funding to implement the 
policies it sets. It says what the poli-
cies will be; it declares what the fund-
ing should be; but there is not one 
penny—not one penny—in this bill. 
That is the job of the Appropriations 
Committee. 
As we prepare to vote for the NDAA, 
Republicans have not come to the table 
to negotiate top-line spending numbers 
so that we can actually enact an appro-
priations bill to pay for our national 
defense. Some have said that they 
would be fine if the government ended 
up operating under a full-year con-
tinuing resolution. Fortunately, there 
are some key Republicans, as with all 
Democrats, who don’t want a con-
tinuing resolution; they would like to 
get the bills done. But we have to actu-
ally do it. We can’t talk about it. We 
can’t be private and say ‘‘Oh, yeah, I 
am for you on that,’’ but we actually 
do it. 
So I suggest that if people are won-
dering whether a continuing resolution 
helps us, do the math. A full-year CR 
would not only reduce defense spending 
by $35 billion compared with what is in 
the NDAA bill, but it would actually 
cut defense spending below last year’s 
level. Just think about that. 
We can talk about all the wonderful 
things we are doing, but if we don’t 
pass the appropriations bill, if we only 
have a continuing resolution, we cut 
defense spending below last year’s lev-
els. So instead of the $35 billion that 
they are touting and one minute wav-
ing the flag and declaring they support 
our troops and our military and then 
the next day have no problem in cut-
ting the funds—if we refuse to go ahead 
and actually pass the appropriations 
bills and go instead to a continuing 
resolution, we are cutting funds. It al-
most makes me think of Alice in Won-
derland. I wonder if we are going 
through the looking glass. 
Democrats have put a fair offer on 
the table to get us through this mo-
rass. It provides a 5-percent increase 
for defense programs compared to last 
fiscal year, a 13-percent increase for all 
other programs. The 5-percent increase 
for defense we picked because it is 
equal to the increase contained in the 
NDAA that we are going to vote on 
today. 
I would predict that the large major-
ity of Senators, Republicans and Demo-
crats alike, will vote for the NDAA 
with that 5 percent increase. Well, stop 
holding up the appropriations bill that 
actually has the money—that has the 
money. The NDAA is a promissory 
note; the appropriations bill is the 
cash. 
The money we have in appropriations 
is equal to the increase for defense pro-
grams that Republicans unanimously 
endorsed when the NDAA was marked 
up in the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee. It is equal to the increase that 
just passed the House. In the U.S. Con-
gress, that is as close to a consensus as 
I have seen around here, and I have 
been here a few years. 
One Republican House appropriator 
has even said publicly that he wants an 
appropriations deal at the NDAA levels 
because the NDAA fully funds our de-
fense needs for the coming year. I want 
him to know that is the offer the 
Democrats put on the table 2 months 
ago. So far, I have heard deafening si-
lence. 
We have to go for it. We have people 
in both parties who understand the 
need for an appropriations bill. I rec-
ommend we all get together and get it 
done because the men and women who 
serve in the military deserve more 
than lipservice. 
Any Senator who votes for this au-
thorization bill today should have no 
problem embracing an offer that pro-
vides the money to actually pay for it. 
They certainly should not be putting 
us on a course for a full-year con-
tinuing resolution, which would cause 
cuts in our national defense and, I be-
lieve, would weaken our national secu-
rity. 
Secretary Austin has said that a full- 
year’s CR would be unsound, misappro-
priate billions of dollars, and erode the 
U.S. military advantage relative to 
China. The Secretary also noted that 
investments in research, infrastruc-
ture, and public health are equally 
critical to our national security. 
I ask unanimous consent that Sec-
retary Austin’s full statement be print-
ed in the RECORD at the end of my 
statement. 
The strength of our military and na-
tional security is built on the strength 
of our people. Without domestic invest-
ments in education, healthcare, re-
search, economic development, and 
science, we can’t maintain our mili-
tary. Without combating the opioid, 
substance abuse, and mental health 
crises facing our country today, we will 
no longer be able to recruit the best of 
the best. We need full-year appropria-
tions bills to make these investments 
so people can sit and see what we have 
and where we are going with it. 
Recently, some Members on the 
other side of the aisle have taken to 
the floor of the Senate to decry a lack 
of progress on the appropriations bills. 
They criticize Democrats for not bring-
ing bills to the floor. But let’s be real. 
The only reason we have been unable 
to move more bills through committee 
or bring bills to the floor for debate is 
because Republicans have said they op-
pose them until we have a top line. OK. 
Then negotiate the very top line they 
require to move bills instead of refus-
ing to negotiate that top line. Come

on. You can’t put barriers across the 
highway and then complain that traffic 
is stopped. 
I have been calling for bipartisan and 
bicameral negotiations with the White 
House to reach an agreement on top 
lines since March—March, April, May, 
June, July, August, September, Octo-
ber, November, and now December. It 
is probably time enough to get moving. 
In October, I released a comprehen-
sive proposal, with the support of 
House Democrats, on a path forward. I 
would ask the Republicans to join us at 
the negotiating table. We have a job to 
do. We are 10 weeks into the fiscal 
year. Let’s step up and make a serious 
offer on a top-line agreement. We 
Democrats have done that. Republicans 
need to do that now—not one that pan-
ders to the extremes of their base—and 
do it in the next few weeks. 
I have been here for a lot of years. 
Most of the time I have been here, I 
have been on the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee. I have seen Repub-
licans and Democrats come together. I 
have seen Senators from the left and 
the right come together, knowing that 
you have to have a consensus, knowing 
that you don’t pass appropriations bills 
on sound bites and on a wish list; you 
do it with substantive work. 
Our staff has been working through-
out recesses and everything else to 
have this, so let’s get to work. Let’s 
negotiate full-year appropriations bills 
that address our country’s many needs, 
including our country’s national de-
fense. We have done this over and over 
again over the years. We can easily do 
it now. 
I have talked with the leaders of both 
parties. I think we are ready. I think 
anybody who fully understands how ap-
propriations work know that a con-
tinuing resolution for the year is not 
the way to go. It doesn’t help the coun-
try. It doesn’t help the people whom we 
represent. It certainly doesn’t help the 
credibility of the U.S. Senate. And we 
are in a position where the House 
wants to work with us. Let’s get to 
work and spend a few days doing that. 
Let’s pass the omnibus with the indi-
vidual appropriations bills in it. It has 
been done in the past. It can be done 
again. 
My staff has been working night and 
day and weekends. We have everything 
together. I have talked with several 
Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
They want to go forward. Well, let’s go 
forward for the sake of the country, for 
the sake of this body that I respect so 
much. 
Every single day, when I walk here 
into the Senate, I think what a privi-
lege it is to be here. But with that 
privilege comes a responsibility—a re-
sponsibility to the people of this coun-
try, the people we represent. We can 
fulfill that responsibility by passing 
these appropriations bills. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
STATEMENT BY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE LLOYD 
J. AUSTIN III ON THE IMPACT OF A FULL-YEAR 
CONTINUING RESOLUTION—DEC. 6, 2021 
The Department of Defense once again 
faces the threat of a continuing resolution to 
fund our programs and operations into the 
new year. While the short-term CR passed by 
Congress was a necessary measure to keep 
the government open and provide additional 
time to reach agreement on full-year appro-
priations bills, some have even suggested a 
CR could last an entire year, an unprece-
dented move that would cause enormous, if 
not irreparable, damage for a wide range of 
bipartisan priorities—from defense readiness 
and modernization, to research and develop-
ment, to public health. 
A full-year CR would be a fiscally unsound 
way of funding the Department of Defense 
and government as a whole. It would 
misalign billions of dollars in resources in a 
manner inconsistent with evolving threats 
and the national security landscape, which 
would erode the U.S. military advantage rel-
ative to China, impede our ability to inno-
vate and modernize, degrade readiness, and 
hurt our people and their families. And it 
would offer comfort to our enemies, disquiet 
to our allies, and unnecessary stress to our 
workforce. 
Essentially, in terms of real dollars, a CR 
would represent a budget cut—and a signifi-
cant one at that. 
I urge Congress to reach a bipartisan, bi-
cameral agreement on FY 2022 appropria-
tions, and avoid a full-year CR, in the com-
ing weeks. 
First and most importantly, failure to 
reach an agreement would put our military 
and their families under additional and need-
less stress. It would mean that providing the 
2.7 percent pay increase the President pro-
posed and they so richly deserve—as well as 
housing allowances and other new benefits— 
would come at the expense of suspending 
many of their change-of-station moves and 
force us to limit the numbers of new recruits 
we bring in. And it would result in over five 
billion dollars in cuts to our operating ac-
counts, too, hurting the readiness of our 
troops and curtailing our ability to cover the 
health-care needs of military families. 
More 
than 
100 
military 
construction 
projects—many of which directly impact the 
quality of life of our people—would also be 
delayed if Congress maintains current fund-
ing levels under a full-year CR. And make no 
mistake about it, the impacts of those delays 
would be felt not only across the Depart-
ment, but also in local communities around 
the country as job opportunities are lost and 
revenue for local businesses diminishes. 
Of course, failing to reach an agreement on 
appropriations would also significantly im-
pact the programs, the technologies and the 
initiatives we are trying to undertake to en-
sure we remain the most capable military in 
the world. The Department’s efforts to ad-
dress innovation priorities such as cyber, ar-
tificial intelligence and hypersonics pro-
grams would be slowed. 
At a time when our adversaries are advanc-
ing their concepts and capabilities to erode 
our strategic advantages . . . and as we 
begin 
to 
knit 
together 
a 
truly 
groundbreaking vision of integrated deter-
rence . . . our hands will be tied. We will be 
forced to spend money on things we don’t 
need and stop spending money on invest-
ments we desperately do need. 
And I’d note that as important as full-year 
appropriations are for the Department of De-
fense, investments at the State Department, 
in research and development at the major re-
search agencies, and in infrastructure and 
public health are equally critical to our na-
tional security. 
Again, I strongly urge Congress to seize 
this opportunity to sustain American com-
petitiveness, advance American leadership, 
and enable our forces by immediately reach-
ing a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on 
full-year 2022 appropriations. It’s not only 
the right thing to do, it’s the best thing they 
can do for our nation’s defense.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
S. 1605 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
NDAA, for the past six decades, Con-
gress has worked on a bipartisan basis 
to pass an annual Defense bill without 
fail. After today, this year will be no 
different. 
Later this morning, the Senate will 
hold a vote to pass NDAA legislation 
for fiscal year 2022 that has been nego-
tiated on a bipartisan, bicameral basis. 
After it is approved by this Chamber, 
the bill will go to the President’s desk 
for his signature. 
With so many priorities to balance, I 
thank my colleagues for working hard 
over these last few months, both in 
committee and on the floor, to get 
NDAA done. I want to particularly rec-
ognize my colleague Chairman REED 
for his work shepherding this impor-
tant process through. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Mr. President, now, for a Build Back 
Better update, this week, Democrats 
also continue working on getting the 
Senate into a position where we can 
vote on the President’s Build Back Bet-
ter legislation. We are also continuing 
to hold conversations, as Senate Demo-
crats, on the urgent work of advancing 
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
There is universal view in our caucus 
that we need to pass legislation to pro-
tect our democracy. What the Repub-
lican legislatures are doing—on a pure-
ly partisan basis—is undermining, de-
stroying our democracy. 
We believe that we can restore the 
Senate to work the way it is supposed 
to and at the same time deal with vot-
ing rights. And that is what we are 
aiming to do. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, now, on judicial nomi-
nations, in addition to our legislative 
agenda, the Senate is also making good 
progress this week on confirming more 
of President Biden’s nominees, both to 
his administration and the Federal 
bench. 
Today, we will vote to confirm two 
more of the President’s judicial nomi-
nees, and it is possible I will file clo-
ture on more today. At the district

level, we will confirm Samantha El-
liott to serve as district judge for the 
District of New Hampshire. And we will 
also vote on the confirmation of Jen-
nifer Sung to sit as a circuit judge for 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Sung has 
proven herself to be an exceptional and 
impartial adjudicator, a valiant advo-
cate for working Americans, and I am 
confident she will be an excellent judge 
who adds to the personal and profes-
sional diversity of the Ninth Circuit. 
For much of her time in private prac-
tice, Ms. Sung dedicated herself to rep-
resenting workers in disputes against 
unscrupulous employers. The folks she 
has fought for over her career haven’t 
been privileged individuals. On the con-
trary, they have been everyday work-
ing Americans: low-income workers, 
minority workers, and largely under-
served communities—folks who just 
want a fair shake. 
As a member of the Oregon Employ-
ment Relations Board, where she has 
served in a quasi-judicial role adjudi-
cating disputes between workers and 
management, Ms. Sung has displayed 
immense skill striking a delicate bal-
ance between protecting the interests 
of working Americans while applying 
the law fairly and impartially and 
without preconception. This balance is 
crucial for anyone under consideration 
for the bench, and that is the point. 
We are having, of course, demo-
graphic diversity. Ms. Sung represents 
that as an Asian American. But we are 
also 
having 
professional 
diversity, 
where people from different walks of 
life and different experiences serve in 
these very important courts, not just 
prosecutors and people from big law 
firms. So this is a very, very important 
change that we are making to the 
bench. 
This year, we have made progress in 
adding that new level of diversity to 
the bench, but we still have a lot of 
work to do to make our courts reflect 
the diversity and richness of our de-
mocracy. 
And on one more judge, Ali Nathan, 
earlier this morning it was my honor 
to come before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee to introduce Ali Nathan, 
nominated by President Biden, on my 
recommendation, to serve as circuit 
judge for the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
Judge Nathan is a remarkable and 
barrier-breaking nominee for the Fed-
eral bench. A graduate of Cornell Law 
School, a clerk for both the Ninth Cir-
cuit and the Supreme Court, under Jus-
tice Stevens, and a member of Presi-
dent Obama’s White House counsel and 
the Office of the Solicitor General in 
New York, Judge Nathan’s resume is 
nothing short of impeccable. 
I can happily say that this will be the 
second time I have recommended Judge 
Nathan to serve on the bench. A decade 
ago, I urged President Obama to con-
sider Ali Nathan to serve as district 
judge in the Southern District. 
I am glad President Obama listened. 
And after a decade of admirable service 
on the bench, it is clear that appoint-
ing her was the right decision. And, 
one more important point, if confirmed 
to the Second Circuit, Judge Nathan 
would only be the second LGBTQ 
woman to serve as a Federal appellate 
judge in the United States—another 
important step in tearing down the 
barriers in the halls of justice. 
If confirmed, I am confident that 
Judge Nathan will serve with distinc-
tion and excellence on the Second Cir-
cuit. 
So, thanks to Senate Democrats, 
President Biden has more total circuit 
and district judge nominees confirmed 
before December 15 of his first year 
than 
any 
President 
since 
Ronald 
Reagan. By the end of the day, the 
tally will stand at 31 new judges con-
firmed in 2021. 
Let me repeat that. By the end of 
today, the Senate will have confirmed 
31 judges in President Biden’s first 
year—20 to the district courts and 11 to 
serve as appellate judges on the Fed-
eral circuit. 
Four years ago, under President Don-
ald Trump, Republicans lacked any ro-
bust legislative agenda and focused al-
most entirely on rubberstamping the 
parade of far-right, unqualified, and 
highly ideological nominations to the 
Federal bench. 
This year, we are administering the 
antidote: All year long the Democratic 
majority has begun rebalancing our 
courts with mainstream, highly quali-
fied, and diverse judges—historically 
diverse both in their profession and 
personhood. 
Over half of the new judges are 
women, over half are people of color, 
and all of them are immensely quali-
fied by virtue of their skills, their ex-
perience, and their unique perspectives 
they bring to the Federal bench. 
We are going to continue working as 
much as we can for the rest of this year 
to confirm more judges. And you can 
be sure that we will push even harder 
in 2022. 
Mr. President, one more point on Re-
publican nomination obstruction, be-
sides judicial nominees, we have a re-
sponsibility in this Chamber to confirm 
President Biden’s nominees to his ad-
ministration. 
Every 
President—and 
this one too—deserves to have his ad-
ministration filled, and for years in the 
past, both sides have worked together 
when possible. But this year, we are 
seeing a new low from Senate Repub-
licans. Because of the cynical blockade 
of a handful of Members on the other 
side, the Senate now faces a backlog of 
at least 150 nominees, many of whom 
would have sailed through the Chamber 
in years past. 
We have now had to file cloture on 
twice as many nominees at this point 
in President Biden’s administration as 
Republicans had to do under President 
Trump. 
Let’s be clear about the nominees at 
issue. We aren’t talking about partisan 
firebrands or candidates who come out 
of left field. The bulk of these men and 
women are uncontroversial, by the 
book, 
professional 
public 
servants. 
Many of these nominees would work on 
issues like supply chains and national 
security, which our Republican col-
leagues say they want to address. But 
now those lives, and the lives of their 
families, have been thrown into total 
limbo, all because a handful of Repub-
licans have hijacked the rules of the 
Senate to slow the confirmation proc-
ess to a glacial pace, against precedent 
and common sense. 
We have been working over the past 
day to secure a lift on many of these 
holds. I want to echo what Senator 
MENENDEZ has made clear: If the Sen-
ator from Texas offers a proposal that 
does not include lifting all State, 
Treasury, and USAID nominees, we 
cannot come to an agreement. 
Democrats are working to clear as 
much of the backlog as possible by con-
sent. If we can’t make too much 
progress, we may need to stay and hold 
votes on nominees this weekend and 
next week until we do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I also ask 
unanimous consent that prior to the 
vote, I be able to complete my re-
marks, followed by Senator INHOFE, 
followed by Senator REED. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S. 1605 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I am 
pleased that today we will finally move 
to a vote on the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022. 
Thanks to the Democrats’ focus on 
their reckless Build Back Better tax- 
and-spending spree, consideration of 
the NDAA, one of the most important 
bills we consider every year, was de-
layed for months. 
Of course, once we finally got onto 
the bill, Democrats rushed the process. 
Senators of both parties filed a total of 
1,000 amendments on this bill, but not 
one—not a single one—of those amend-
ments received a vote on the Senate 
floor. 
But at least we are finally here set to 
pass this critical legislation. I am 
pleased the Republicans were able to 
strengthen this bill in committee and 
in the so-called preconference negotia-
tions. This includes removing trouble-
some provisions like red-flag laws that 
would summarily suspend the Second 
Amendment rights of our men and 
women in uniform. 
Thanks in large part to Republican 
efforts, the final bill is $25 billion 
above President Biden’s inadequate 
budget request.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9172 
December 15, 2021 
We have made a lot of progress over 
the past several years on rebuilding 
our military, which, I might add, after 
years of underfunding and budgetary 
uncertainty, 
combined 
with 
heavy 
operational demands, had been left 
underequipped, 
undermanned, 
and 
underprepared to meet the threats of 
the 21st century. The situation had 
gotten so bad that in 2018, the bipar-
tisan National Defense Strategy Com-
mission released a report warning that 
our readiness had eroded to the point 
where we might struggle to win a war 
against a major power like Russia or 
China—an especially chilling warning 
considering the mounting destabiliza-
tion from both of these countries 
today. The Commission noted that we 
would be especially vulnerable if we 
were ever called on to fight a war on 
two fronts. 
But, as I said, over the past several 
years, we made a lot of progress on re-
storing military readiness. Unfortu-
nately, President Biden’s inadequate 
budget request threatened to undo 
some 
of 
that 
progress. 
So 
I 
am 
pleased—very pleased—that, thanks in 
large part to Republican efforts, Demo-
crats and Republicans have agreed on a 
final number that will continue our re-
investment in our military so that our 
men and women in uniform will have 
the resources they need to address the 
threats of the 21st century. 
With both China and Russia flexing 
their military power and the growing 
danger of a further Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, it is critically important that 
we ensure that our Nation is always 
prepared to defend itself and our vital 
national 
interests, 
whatever 
the 
threat. 
On the subject of Ukraine, I am very 
pleased the final bill we will vote on 
today includes an additional $50 mil-
lion in military assistance for Ukraine. 
Ukraine has spent years dealing with a 
Russian invasion that threatens to 
push further into its sovereign terri-
tory, and we should be supporting the 
efforts of this free nation to defend 
itself from Russian aggression. 
I am particularly proud to announce 
that this year’s NDAA contains the 
necessary funding to continue essential 
preparation for the B–21 mission at 
Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Da-
kota. 
We found out in June of this year 
that Ellsworth had officially been 
named ‘‘Main Operating Base 1’’ for the 
future B–21 bomber, home of the Raid-
er. This designation not only means 
Ellsworth will be the first base to host 
the B–21 Raider but will also host the 
formal training unit and the first oper-
ational squadron. The stealth B–21 
bomber will eventually replace the Air 
Force’s B–1s, which have been a proven 
workhorse within Global Strike Com-
mand but must be divested to free up 
capacity and resources for an even 
more agile and capable bomber fleet. 
Once operational, the B–21 Raider 
will be a critical part of our Nation’s 
long-range strike capabilities and nu-
clear deterrent well into the future. I 
am incredibly proud that South Da-
kota and Ellsworth were chosen to 
serve as the first operating base for the 
B–21s. 
When I first came to the Senate, the 
outlook for Ellsworth wasn’t so rosy. I 
had barely arrived here in the Senate 
when Ellsworth was placed on the base 
realignment and closure, or BRAC, list. 
It was an all-hands effort by the con-
gressional delegation and Ellsworth 
and State and community leaders to 
make the case to the Bush administra-
tion and BRAC Commission to remove 
Ellsworth from the closure list. 
Many thought that South Dakota 
might not have the clout to make this 
stand, that we didn’t wield enough in-
fluence. We were only given about a 12- 
percent chance of pulling through, but 
we were determined that we weren’t 
going to lose Ellsworth. We stood our 
ground, and we won the day. Ellsworth 
was removed from the BRAC list that 
August, and we got right to work on 
building up the base so that we would 
never again find ourselves in the same 
position. 
In 2007, we saw the Air Force Finan-
cial Services Center open at Ellsworth, 
and 2011 saw the arrival of the 89th At-
tack Squadron and its command and 
control stations for MQ–9 Reapers. In 
2015, a decade-long mission paid off 
with the quadrupling of the training 
airspace for the base. The Powder 
River Training Complex is now the 
largest training airspace in the conti-
nental United States and can be used 
for large-force exercises that draw 
combat aircraft from across this coun-
try. It is also well-suited for B–21 train-
ing, which is undoubtedly one of the 
reasons Ellsworth was chosen as the 
first home of the Raider. 
I am committed to ensuring that 
Ellsworth has everything it needs for 
its new mission so that it can continue 
to serve as one of our Nation’s essen-
tial military assets for decades to 
come. To that end, I worked to ensure 
that this year’s National Defense Au-
thorization Act contain not only full 
funding for B–21 development but full 
funding for the first of many equip-
ment and support facilities that will be 
needed for the B–21 mission at Ells-
worth, including a low observable coat-
ing and restoration facility, a wash 
rack and maintenance hangar, expand-
ing the flight simulator facility, and 
more. It is imperative that these and 
follow-on 
military 
construction 
projects at Ellsworth stay on pace to 
ensure the B–21, once fielded, can begin 
operations alongside the current B–1 
mission at Ellsworth to enable a 
smooth transition from one mission to 
the next. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act also ensures adequate support for 
our B–1s in South Dakota and in Texas 
and deployed on Bomber Task Force 
missions so that they have the re-
sources they need until they are re-
placed by the B–21s. 
I will continue to do everything I can 
here in Congress to support our B–1s at 
Ellsworth and advance the B–21 mis-
sion. 
Providing for our Nation’s defense is 
one of our most serious responsibilities 
as Members of Congress. We have an 
obligation to ensure that our Nation is 
prepared to meet any threat, whether 
the danger comes from terrorism, 
rogue states, or major powers. We have 
an obligation to ensure that our men 
and women in uniform have the re-
sources they need to confront the 
threats that we ask them to face. 
I am frustrated that it took us so 
long to move to consideration of this 
year’s National Defense Authorization 
Act, but I am happy we did at least 
manage to secure a solid piece of legis-
lation, and I look forward to voting for 
this bill later today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am 
very pleased that the Senate is finally 
voting on the fiscal year 2022 Defense 
authorization bill. It is the most sig-
nificant bill of the year. 
There is an old document that no-
body reads anymore called the Con-
stitution. It kind of tells us what we 
are supposed to be doing around here, 
and sometimes we forget. We are talk-
ing about national defense. That is 
what we are supposed to be doing. That 
is why Congress has passed a defense 
authorization bill for the last 60 years. 
This will be the 61st year in a row. It 
will pass. It will pass in about another 
half hour from now. It is going to pass 
because it has passed in the past, and 
everyone realizes this is the most im-
portant thing we do here. A lot of peo-
ple don’t say that, but it is true. 
Every year, we come together—the 
House and the Senate, the Republicans 
and the Democrats—and put our dif-
ferences aside and build this bill to-
gether and show our servicemembers 
that we really support them. I think 
that is so important. 
All we have to do is argue about this 
bill, and what we are doing is reflecting 
on the people who are out there on the 
line, out there making the sacrifice 
and losing their lives in many cases. It 
is important that they know this is the 
most important thing we do, and that 
is exactly what we did this year. 
It looked a little different this year 
because the Senate didn’t take up the 
bill until after Veterans Day. I was 
critical of Senator CHUCK SCHUMER. We 
filed our bill—Senator REED and I filed 
this on September 22. We didn’t take it 
up until November 17. That is 2 months 
that was wasted that we could have 
used and used very productively. We 
don’t need to do that. We can’t let that 
happen again. 
It is the most important bill we do 
all year, and it shouldn’t be left to the 
last minute. That is especially the case 
right now because we face threats like 
we have never before in my lifetime 
faced. We have China and Russia. They 
are growing and modernizing their 
militaries at a rate that we have never

seen before and using their new tech-
nology to menace their neighbors. We 
are seeing Russia build up forces on the 
Ukrainian border, most likely intended 
to be used for them to attack. We feel 
that is what is happening now. 
We have seen evidence that China is 
testing hypersonic missile technology 
that we don’t even have. We don’t have 
hypersonic missile technology like the 
Chinese have. Those of us who have 
studied what happened in World War II, 
we swore we weren’t going to let this 
happen. And for a long period of time, 
we had the best of everything. In one 
area where America should have the 
best of everything, we didn’t have the 
best of everything. 
So we have seen threats and are see-
ing threats now that we haven’t seen 
before. Yes, on the Ukrainian border— 
we know what is happening there. We 
know 100,000 people are ready to go in. 
The Russians are there. Now we are 
seeing China use things that we don’t 
even have today. 
At the same time, following a disas-
trous withdrawal, terrorist organiza-
tions are resurging in Afghanistan. I 
think we all remember in Afghani-
stan—what happened when the Presi-
dent went in and we had a withdrawal 
when we shouldn’t have had a with-
drawal. Our allies and partners are 
questioning our credibility and com-
mitment because of that debacle. 
Iran continues to expand its nuclear 
program, and North Korea continues 
its own provocations. 
In short, we have no shortage of chal-
lenges to our security and our military 
supremacy. The security situation with 
both China and Russia has gotten far 
worse since the Armed Services Com-
mittee first advanced this bill back in 
July. It has gotten worse over the last 
few days and certainly every week. 
I can’t think of a more necessary bill 
to pass right now, as we are going to do 
in another short period of minutes. 
This Defense authorization bill is the 
most important bill we have. I worked 
together with Chairman REED, Senator 
REED, Chairman SMITH, Ranking Mem-
ber ROGERS, and the Armed Services 
Committees in both Chambers to build 
a bill that will help us respond to all 
these threats. We worked together. We 
worked together in the committee for a 
long time. 
People think, well, this is only some-
thing that we are doing—those of us 
who are in the position to be providing 
the leadership in our military—that we 
do once a year, but I can tell you right 
now, after we do this—I think it will 
get passed today and will be signed—we 
will start again on next year already. 
Our final product is a responsible, bi-
partisan path forward to strengthen 
the national security and gives our 
troops the resources, training, equip-
ment, and benefits they deserve. We 
are talking about our troops. They 
need it. We don’t want them to have 
close fights out there. We don’t want 
them to have equipment that isn’t the 
best equipment. 
I am afraid that we are in a situation 
right now where that is the case. The 
first and most important way to do 
that is by boosting the defense top line 
by $25 billion. That is what we did. The 
very first thing that we did was to 
bring that up to something where it is 
$25 billion over President Biden’s re-
quest. 
I know defense isn’t Biden’s top pri-
ority, but we showed that it is a bipar-
tisan priority in this Congress. In fact, 
it was the 2018 NDS. This is the NDS. 
This is the National Defense System. 
This is in 2018, and we had six of the 
smartest Democrats in this field and 
six of the smartest Republicans. We got 
together and put together this thing 
called Providing for the National De-
fense. This was the Defense Strategy 
Commission. It is one we have been fol-
lowing since that time, and it shows 
that we can get things done. This is 
what we refer to. This is our pattern, 
and a budget cut like the President 
wanted isn’t going to get us there. 
In total, this bill authorizes almost 
$778 billion for the Department of De-
fense and for nuclear programs at the 
Department of Energy. This increase 
supports many of the military’s un-
funded priorities, things they need that 
President Biden’s inadequate budget 
couldn’t meet, plus things Congress 
agrees that the Department must fund 
in critical areas. 
And we provided a 35-percent in-
crease above the President’s budget for 
military 
construction, 
the 
largest 
MILCON that we have had in over 10 
years. We also provided a $4.7 billion 
increase for shipbuilding, allowing our 
military to purchase five new battle- 
force ships, which will be key in our 
priority theater, in the Indo-Pacific. 
And I think we know what the Chinese 
have been doing with their ship pro-
gram. 
We bolstered support to key allies, 
like Taiwan and Ukraine. This year’s 
NDAA actually increases funding for 
the Ukrainian Security Assistance Ini-
tiative by $50 million, giving Ukraine 
some $300 million in defense, which is 
also in our defense too. 
And the bill includes strong bipar-
tisan support for our nuclear deterrent, 
which is the cornerstone of our na-
tional security. We fully fund the nu-
clear modernization, which is a top pri-
ority for our military and will solidify 
support for a key leg of our nuclear 
triad. Our triad system is one that we 
have adhered to, and it is something 
that is working. This actually supports 
a key leg of that nuclear triad, which 
is the Ground-Based Strategic Deter-
rent. 
The bill works at every turn to main-
tain our military supremacy and in 
some areas to spur us to catch up in 
other areas where we have fallen be-
hind. We have fallen behind China and 
Russia in certain areas, and we don’t 
like that. And this is what we are try-
ing to correct at the current time. 
One area where we do that is in cyber 
security. We have people, not just ex-
perts on the outside. There is one of 
the members of our Senate Armed 
Services 
Committee, 
Senator 
MIKE 
ROUNDS, who probably knows more 
about cyber security than any one of 
the advisers that are out there. The 
bill creates a whole-of-government ap-
proach, the public-private partnership 
to detect and disrupt our adversary’s 
cyber operations. 
We also accelerate innovation in key 
emerging technologies, like artificial 
intelligence, 
hypersonic 
weapons, 
quantum computing, and 5G. We are 
doing these things. We are just not 
doing it as fast as we should, and this 
is one of the reasons that we are going 
to pass the most important bill of the 
year in just a few minutes. 
Our bill takes numerous steps to 
harden our industrial base and remove 
Russia and China from our national se-
curity supply chain. 
Of course, our top priority, this year 
and any year, is our troops, the brave 
men and women who have volunteered 
to lay down their lives, on the line, for 
our country. This year’s bill gives 
them a well-deserved pay raise and im-
proves health. By the way, these are 
things that people who sometimes talk 
about the fact that we are spending 
some money—I don’t know how many 
times I have heard people say: Well, we 
spend more on defense than China and 
Russia together. 
Well, that is true, but we do some-
thing that China and Russia doesn’t do. 
The most expensive item we have is 
taking care of our troops, making sure 
that the kids of our troops have 
schools to go to that are good schools, 
that we have good housing. 
They don’t care about things like 
that, but we do, and we spend more on 
our military, and people try to use that 
against us. Well, our people are first, 
and we are the only country that be-
lieves that. 
It 
prevents 
servicemembers 
from 
being dishonorably discharged for re-
fusing the coronavirus vaccine. This is 
something where we changed a system 
that otherwise would have offered a 
dishonorable discharge, and it is in this 
bill. 
So it is a good bill. It is not perfect. 
No bill is perfect. There are some 
things I would have had in this bill and 
I am sure that Senator REED would 
have had in this bill that didn’t make 
it. 
Before we close, I do want to thank 
the good people who work so hard on 
this bill on the floor. People don’t real-
ize that. You go back to the real world 
and you talk to real people, as I do 
when I go back to Oklahoma, and they 
point out that they don’t believe that 
people are really working. But in the 
case of the military, they are. 
I just have to say the hours that they 
work. I had occasion to talk to the 
group about John Wason—John Wason 
is the minority staff director—and 
about the number of hours that he 
works and that his team works. And I 
am going to read the names of this

team. Senator REED
is going to be 
reading the names of the majority on 
the team. 
But I think it is important that peo-
ple understand that we have committee 
staff who work hard, and we are very 
thankful for the people who provide all 
that effort. 
On his team, John Wason has Rick 
Berger, Tom Goffus, Scott Richardson, 
Greg Lilly, Marta Hernandez, Jennie 
Wright, Adam Barker, Allen Edwards, 
Katie Magnus, Sean O’Keefe, Brad 
Patout, Jason Potter, Brian Slatterly, 
Katie Sutton, Eric Trager, Adam Trull, 
T.C. Williams, Robert Winkler, and 
Annie Caputo. 
From my staff I had Luke Holland, 
Dan Hillenbrand, Don Archer, Dan 
Holder, Sam Trizza, Esther Salters, 
Jake Johnson, Jake Hinch, Alexandra 
Slocum, 
Victor 
Sarmiento, 
Dixon 
Yonan, Leacy Burke—what would we 
do 
without 
Leacy 
Burke?—Laurie 
Fitch, and Naomi Walker. 
And sometimes we forget about the 
hard-working floor staff. Nobody ever 
mentions that. We have a lot of the 
same people who have been there for a 
number of years, and we couldn’t oper-
ate without them. And they were real-
ly busy on this bill. And that is Robert 
Duncan, Chris Tuck, Tony Hanagan, 
Katherine Foster, Brian Canfield, Max 
Boyd, and Maddie Sanborn. 
I am grateful for all of their services. 
And don’t forget: This is only half of 
the battle. After this, we have to go 
through and after we have made the 
priorities that we have made, the ap-
propriators will get busy and do what 
they have done to be a part of this ef-
fort, which is the most significant ef-
fort that we are having. 
So today I encourage all of my col-
leagues to support this year’s National 
Defense Authorization bill—I know 
they will—and extend our 60-year track 
record of getting this bill done. And 
let’s tell the troops that we love them 
and we support them. 
With that, I yield to Chairman JACK 
REED. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to 
express my support for the fiscal year 
2022 National Defense Authorization 
Act. I am pleased, as we all are, that 
we will be voting soon on passage. 
I would like to thank Ranking Mem-
ber INHOFE for his leadership and his 
thoughtfulness on this bill. He has been 
an excellent partner throughout this 
whole process. 
Our Nation faces an enormous range 
of security challenges, and it is more 
important than ever that we provide 
our military men and women with the 
support they need to keep Americans 
safe. 
To that end, this bill makes great 
progress. It addresses a broad range of 
pressing issues, from strategic com-
petition with China and Russia, to dis-
ruptive technologies like hypersonics, 
AI, and quantum computing, to mod-
ernizing our ships, aircraft, and vehi-
cles. It provides our servicemembers 
with the resources and support they 
need to defend our Nation, while at the 
same taking care of their families. 
Importantly, this bill authorizes a 
well-deserved 2.7-percent pay raise for 
both military members and the DOD 
civilian workforce. It also increases pa-
rental leave to 12 weeks for all 
servicemembers and creates a new 2- 
week bereavement leave benefit for 
both military and Federal civilian em-
ployees. 
I want to especially note that this 
bill includes historic, sweeping reforms 
to the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice and how the military investigates 
and prosecutes sexual assault and 
other offenses, including murder, man-
slaughter, kidnapping, and many other 
crimes. Just as my Senate colleagues, 
the President’s Independent Review 
Commission, and survivors advocate 
groups have called for, this bill takes 
prosecutorial power away from the 
chain of command for these cases. Our 
bill creates ‘‘special trial counsel,’’ 
highly specialized prosecutors who will 
have exclusive, binding, and final deci-
sion-making authority over whether to 
prosecute these offenses. This is a sea 
change for the military justice system, 
and I am grateful to my colleagues in 
both Chambers and on both sides of the 
aisle for working together to achieve 
this historic reform for the well-being 
of our military women and men. 
Indeed, we listened to survivors, ad-
vocates, and experts because we owe it 
to our servicemembers to get this pol-
icy right. The world is as dangerous 
and complex as it has ever been. We de-
pend on the military to answer the call 
in these challenging times, and we owe 
it to them to ensure the policies we 
enact on this matter and others pre-
serves this Nation’s military power and 
cohesion. I respect those who might see 
this matter differently, but this bill 
makes our country and our troops 
more secure because we listened to ad-
vocates and experts to reach a com-
promise with the House of Representa-
tives. 
This year’s defense bill also makes 
excellent progress toward meeting the 
challenges of long-term strategic com-
petition with China and Russia. It in-
vests in the people, platforms, infra-
structure, and game-changing tech-
nologies that will define the future. It 
extends and modifies the Pacific Deter-
rence Initiative, or PDI, and reiterates 
the Senate’s intent to improve our 
force posture in the Indo-Pacific, in-
crease readiness and presence, and 
build the capabilities of our partners 
and allies to counter the increasing ag-
gression of China. 
Similarly, this year’s bill authorizes 
the continuation of the European De-
terrence Initiative, or EDI, in recogni-
tion of the vital need to support our al-
lies and partners in Europe as we work 
toward the shared goals of deterring 
Russian aggression, addressing stra-
tegic 
competition, 
and 
mitigating 
shared security concerns. 
With respect to our services, we have 
taken steps to improve their capabili-
ties and their ability to fight and win. 
Across the Army, Navy, Air Force, Ma-
rine Corps, and Space Force, this bill 
makes significant efforts to improve 
the readiness of our aircraft, ships, ve-
hicles, missiles, and weapons systems. 
It authorizes significant increases in 
military construction projects, mod-
ernizing our nuclear triad and missile 
defense systems, and investing in cut-
ting-edge technologies such as artifi-
cial intelligence, microelectronics, ad-
vanced 
materials, 
5G, 
and 
bio-
technology. 
And with regard to our withdrawal 
from Afghanistan, we must capture the 
lessons of the last two decades to en-
sure that our future counterterrorism 
efforts in Afghanistan and elsewhere 
continue to hold violent extremists at 
bay. To that end, I am pleased that 
this bill includes the Afghanistan War 
Commission Act, an amendment spear-
headed by Senator DUCKWORTH. 
This bill was originally crafted by 
the Armed Services Committee after a 
series of thoughtful hearings, discus-
sions, and debates on both sides of the 
aisle. Through the committee markup 
process, we considered more than 300 
amendments and ultimately adopted 
143 amendments. Senator INHOFE and I 
introduced this bill to the full Senate 
with the intent of adding more amend-
ments on the floor. Although we were 
not able to come to an agreement to 
debate and vote on several amend-
ments on the floor, we were ultimately 
able to adopt amendments from Sen-
ators on both sides of the aisle in the 
final legislation. 
Over the past several weeks, the Sen-
ate and House Armed Services Com-
mittees have worked around the clock 
to come to an agreement on this final 
version of this bill. I am proud of the 
improvements we made throughout 
this process, and I was pleased to see 
the House vote last week in an over-
whelmingly bipartisan fashion, 363 to 
70, to pass the bill. We have produced a 
strong NDAA that both parties and 
both chambers can support, and the 
President will be able to sign. 
I would like to take this opportunity 
to recognize the phenomenal staff who 
have made this bill possible. I want to 
specifically recognize the director for 
the Democratic staff, Elizabeth King, 
and the director for the Republican 
staff, John Wason. They have led their 
staffs and collaborated admirably with 
bipartisanship, diligence, and utmost 
professionalism. 
I would also like to thank members 
of the Armed Services Committee staff: 
Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon 
Clark, Jenny Davis, Jonathan Epstein, 
Jorie Feldman, Creighton Greene, Gary 
Leeling,

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to seek unanimous consent to 
confirm 
Amanda 
Howe, 
President 
Biden’s nominee to be the next Assist-
ant Administrator for Mission Support 
at the Environmental Protection Agen-
cy. 
I believe that my friend Senator LEE 
is going to object to this consent re-
quest. I hope when he does that he will 
explain his objection to this extremely 
qualified nominee. 
I have known the nominee for more 
than 20 years and can speak directly to 
her talents and abilities. Amanda held 
a number of roles in the Common-
wealth of Virginia, including serving as 
my assistant secretary of commerce 
and trade during my 10 years as Gov-
ernor. 
Amanda also served then-Governor 
KAINE’s administration and Governor 
MCAULIFFE’s administration and has 
held other leadership positions, includ-
ing serving as deputy and then acting 
chief of staff to Mayor Bill de Blasio in 
New York. 
Amanda led the planning and organi-
zation of the Queen’s visit to Virginia 
in 2007, when we celebrated 400 years of 
connection to the UK. She helped plan 
the first-ever ticker tape parade for the 
U.S. women’s soccer team to celebrate 
the first World Cup victory. She orga-
nized Pope Francis’s visit to New York. 
Beyond being a talented operator, 
Amanda also possesses a wealth of 
knowledge on issues under the EPA’s 
purview, having worked on roles fo-
cused on renewable energy. 
Amanda has been nominated to lead 
the EPA’s Office of Mission Support, 
which directs the Agency’s efforts to

improve efficiency, coordination, and 
customer experiences for internal and 
external stakeholders and the public, 
including the protection of EPA’s fa-
cilities and other assets nationwide 
that are terribly important to our gov-
ernment; IT management, for example, 
inside the EPA. 
It is my strong belief that Amanda 
has the requisite knowledge, expertise, 
and experience to carry out these crit-
ical functions at EPA. 
I am also very proud of the fact—and 
I thank the chair and ranking member 
of the EPW committee—that she got 
passed out on a voice vote. 
Now is the time to confirm Amanda 
so she can begin to oversee these crit-
ical management activities at the 
EPA. 
So I, therefore, ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate consider the fol-
lowing nomination: Executive Calendar 
No. 560, Amanda Howe, of Virginia, to 
be Assistant Administrator of the En-
vironmental Protection Agency; that if 
confirmed, the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination and the Presi-
dent be immediately notified of the 
Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I made communica-
tion with the EPA as to how to resolve 
a concern that I have. It should be an 
easy thing to resolve. I am waiting to 
hear back a response from them. In the 
meantime, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. LEE. Sure. 
Mr. 
WARNER. 
It 
is 
my 
under-
standing your concern with the nomi-
nee is not about the nominee’s quali-
fications. 
Mr. LEE. It relates to a matter at 
the EPA. 
Mr. WARNER. Thank you. 
I thank the Senator from Utah. 
Mr. President, I do hope this matter 
is resolved. I believe Amanda needs to 
be installed and doing her job. She has 
been up for this nomination literally 
for months. 
I also feel this is just one more exam-
ple—I think probably every Member of 
the Senate, including the Presiding Of-
ficer, has a number of individuals he 
supports. I know many of my col-
leagues on the Republican side have 
nominees they support. The kind of 
blanket holds that are taking place on 
way too many of our nominees means 
that this President can’t put in place 
his team. 
The Presiding Officer was a Gov-
ernor. He is about to be replaced by an-
other Governor. I was a Governor. I 
can’t imagine running an administra-
tion a year into my term if I didn’t 
have two-thirds of my appointees serv-
ing in office. 
The Presiding Officer, I know—I will 
end very briefly—is an extraordinarily 
valuable member of the Intelligence 
Committee. We see America’s national 
security concerns on a daily basis. 
Those national security concerns will 
be better met when every major nation 
in the world has an American Ambas-
sador. It is great that we have State 
Department personnel, but without 
that Ambassador in these offices— 
Amanda is not up for ambassadorship, 
but there are a host of Ambassadors in 
critical nations that need to be con-
firmed. 
I hope—as we wind down these last 
few days of this session before the end 
of the year, I implore my friends on the 
Republican side, give these folks who 
have waited for months and months 
and months a kind of assurance of 
their ability to serve, especially when 
they are noncontroversial. Please re-
move their objections. Stop objecting. 
Let’s let the government have these 
people, personnel in place. I hope 
Amanda Howe will be one of those. I 
look forward to my friend from Utah 
resolving this issue. 
I thank the Presiding Officer for lis-
tening to my extra 5 minutes. 
I yield the floor. 
The

OFFICER

HICKENLOOPER). 
The 
Senator

OPIOID EPIDEMIC 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we 
all know that our country is facing a 
drug crisis. I think it is pretty well 
known, as the CDC has reported, that 
over 100,000 Americans died from a drug 
overdose over a recent 12-month period. 
Although fentanyl drugs are heavily 
responsible for this, we are battling the 
fight on many fronts. For instance, 
synthetic drug use is evolving and, of 
course, very dangerous; same thing for 
methamphetamine, which is very much 
on the rise. 
Too many lives are being lost. That 
is why I have been busy working on 
legislation to stop this epidemic, bills 
like this title of a bill: Stop the Impor-
tation and Manufacturing of Synthetic 
Analogues Act of 2021. 
For too long, criminals have been 
skirting the law. Do you know how 
they do it? By changing the chemical 
makeup of a drug. They keep ahead of 
regulation-writing. They keep ahead of 
Congress making laws. Congress is 
kind of in a situation of playing the 
deadly game of whack-a-mole as law 
enforcement tries to keep pace with 
savvy drug dealers. My bipartisan bill 
nips this deadly cycle in the bud. This 
bill would control synthetic substances 
similar to known drugs while the more 
time-consuming testing, research, and 
analysis can be performed. 
Also, methamphetamine abuse and 
use is very concerning. The volume and 
purity of meth smuggled from Mexico 
into the United States is at a near all-
time high. To address this dire situa-
tion, I joined with Senator FEINSTEIN 
of California to reintroduce the Meth-
amphetamine Response Act. This bill 
declares meth an emerging threat and 
requires the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy to develop and imple-
ment a national plan to prevent meth 
addiction and overdoses. This is a nec-
essary step to combat meth in Iowa 
and, of course, in the rest of the coun-
try. 
The Senate passed, very recently, the 
Meth Response Act. In fact, it was 
passed this week. The House must act 
quickly to get the bill to President 
Biden’s desk. Meth is rampant, and ac-
tion should not be delayed. 
I also joined with Senator FEINSTEIN 
to reintroduce a cannabidiol and mari-
juana research bill to encourage sci-
entific and medical research on mari-
juana. Instead of rushing into legal-
izing or decriminalizing marijuana, we 
need a better understanding of that 
plant and its potential benefits but 
also to know what the side effects are. 
Let’s not put the cart before the horse 
here in the Senate. 
I have also been active as cochairman 
of the Senate Caucus on International 
Narcotics Control. Along with the 
chairman, Senator WHITEHOUSE, we 
held hearings examining the Federal 
response to the drug overdose epidemic 
and the nexus between illicit drug 
trade and corruption. 
I also convened a field hearing in 
Iowa to hear from grassroots, the ex-
perts there and the constituents there, 
about our own State’s efforts—drug 
control, prevention, and treatment ef-
forts. At that hearing, we had a sad 
story by a father, Rod Courtney from 
North Liberty, IA, sharing his story of 
losing his son Chad 5 years ago due to 
fentanyl. Rod’s powerful testimony is 
just one instance of the struggles fami-
lies face from drug abuse. 
Stories like Chad’s are why I sent 
multiple letters to the Biden adminis-
tration to proactively and permanently 
schedule fentanyl-related substances. 
We did get a positive response. I am 
glad to see that the Biden administra-
tion has taken my advice and probably 
the advice of a lot of other Senators as 
well and recommended permanently 
scheduling fentanyl drugs. 
Yet 
the 
administration 
proposes 
shielding fentanyl dealers from manda-
tory minimums. These dealers are po-
tential killers. This watered-down posi-
tion flies in the face of our current cri-
sis with fentanyl. We have to keep our 
neighborhoods safe and must hold poi-
son peddlers accountable. That is par-
ticularly true with fentanyl offenders. 
I am happy to say that, with my sup-
port, Congress has extended the life-
saving scheduling authority into Feb-
ruary, but don’t be fooled—we still 
need a permanent solution. 
With the close of 2021 on the horizon, 
it is natural to reflect. One hundred 
thousand overdose deaths is an un-
speakable tragedy. Each loss is a loved 
one, a friend, or a neighbor. We must 
find solutions to this crisis, and I look 
forward to being part of that solution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9177 
December 15, 2021 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
moving those bills. 
CROSSFIRE HURRICANE 
Mr. President, on another matter, on 
January 19 of this year, then-President 
Trump issued a memorandum to the 
Attorney General, the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence, and the Director of 
the Central Intelligent Agency. That 
memo directed these Agencies to de-
classify certain Crossfire Hurricane 
records for public dissemination. 
We all know about the fatal defects 
and political decisions that were made 
during Crossfire Hurricane. That type 
of improper government conduct de-
mands maximum transparency. The 
only way you can trust the government 
is to make sure that everything that 
can be made public ought to be made 
public, and the only exceptions to that 
would be personal privacy, national se-
curity issues, and intelligence matters. 
Everything else is the public’s business 
and can be made public without hurt-
ing people or hurting national security. 
On February 25 this year, my staff 
and Senator JOHNSON’s staff requested 
an update from the Justice Department 
on what has been declassified. We want 
to know when a full and complete set 
of declassified records will be provided 
to the Congress of the United States. 
Since February, our respective staffs 
have followed up with the Justice De-
partment on countless emails and 
phone calls. Attorney General Garland 
has consistently failed to provide a 
substantive update. 
We are now in December, and Attor-
ney General Garland hasn’t produced a 
single declassified record to Congress 
relating to Crossfire Hurricane. More 
importantly, Attorney General Gar-
land has kept the American people in 
the dark. 
Now, the Justice Department hasn’t 
claimed that the Durham investigation 
is a basis for refusing to provide these 
records, so what is the delay all about? 
Is the Attorney General trying to 
shield the Justice Department and the 
FBI from further embarrassment? Be-
cause that is why we don’t get a lot of 
stuff public. It is because some bureau-
crat is going to be embarrassed by the 
information coming out. 
The other week, it was reported that 
an alternative Mueller report has been 
located at the Justice Department. 
Now, I don’t know what that is all 
about. Reportedly, DOJ could release it 
soon. This report, if you want to call it 
a 
report, 
was 
drafted 
by 
Andrew 
Weissmann’s team while he served on 
Special Counsel Mueller’s Trump inves-
tigation. 
Now, I want you to know this is the 
same Andrew Weissmann who wiped his 
government phone while working on 
that investigation. Many of his col-
leagues did the same thing to over a 
dozen phones. 
These acts may have deleted Federal 
records that could be key to better un-
derstanding 
their 
decision-making 
process as they pursued their inves-
tigation and wrote their report. 
On September 11 last year, I wrote to 
the Justice Department, asking about 
the potential violation of the Federal 
recordkeeping laws. I also asked what 
steps the Justice Department had 
taken to recover these deleted records. 
In response, then, the usual response: 
The Department failed to answer these 
questions. Instead, it provided a letter 
from the inspector general rather than 
providing a full and complete answer 
for itself. 
The inspector general said that 96 
phones were assigned to the Mueller 
team, but the Justice Department 
can’t locate 59 of those phones. Ini-
tially, the Justice Department took 
possession of 79 of 96 phones. 
Based on the information provided to 
me and Senator JOHNSON from the in-
spector general, it appears, then, that 
74 were reviewed for official record-
keeping purposes; that is, only 74 out 
of 96 phones. 
Accordingly, 22 of Mueller’s team’s 
phones weren’t reviewed for Federal 
recordkeeping purposes so we need to 
know who those phones belong to. This 
is beyond suspicious, and the Attorney 
General doesn’t seem to have a care in 
the world. 
The inspector general told us there is 
a document called the SCO Inventory 
and Property Transfer Document. That 
would give us a better idea of the Fed-
eral recordkeeping process during the 
Mueller investigation. To date, Attor-
ney General Garland has failed to 
produce that document. 
So what we have here is yet another 
example of a complete and total Jus-
tice Department failure. On the one 
hand, the Biden Justice Department 
has no idea what records should be 
classified—should be declassified pur-
suant to President Trump’s January 
2021 declassification order. 
The Biden Justice Department has 
failed to tell Congress what, if any-
thing, it has done to retrieve the miss-
ing Mueller phones. The Biden Justice 
Department has also failed to provide 
the Mueller team’s existing text mes-
sages and other records. 
Yet, can you believe it, on the other 
hand, the Justice Department will re-
portedly soon release an alternative 
Mueller report because a Federal court 
made them do it. 
Congress has an independent con-
stitutional oversight authority, and 
that authority requires the executive 
branch to be responsive to oversight re-
quests, irrespective of any Federal liti-
gation. 
The obvious message from the Biden 
Justice Department is that it will stiff- 
arm congressional oversight that could 
prove embarrassing to the Federal Gov-
ernment—or it is like Garland saying: 
Screw you, Senators. 
Our institutions won’t survive with 
that way of doing the people’s business. 
Transparency 
brings 
accountability. 
Probably my colleagues are tired of my 
saying that—transparency brings ac-
countability. But none of us should 
stop working to hold government offi-
cials accountable for their improper 
conduct, regardless of their political 
party. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON THE SUPREME 
COURT 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, 8 
months after President Biden asked 
them to study Supreme Court reform, 
the Presidential Commission on the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
has finally released its report. 
I want to begin my comments by re-
calling 
the 
backstory 
behind 
this 
group. 
The President created this Commis-
sion to appease some Members of the 
Democratic Party. These progressives 
want to pack the Supreme Court with 
Justices who will put their agenda be-
fore the Constitution. 
Not all Democrats belong to that 
group. I see the Court packers as more 
of a radical fringe who can’t stand the 
thought that the Court may make deci-
sions that they don’t like. 
But instead of lending this fringe ele-
ment the legitimacy they hoped for, 
the Commission’s nearly 300-page re-
port simply lays out the arguments for 
and against Court packing, and then 
makes no recommendation. 
In fact, the lawyers, professors, and 
former judges the President appointed 
were deeply divided on the issue of add-
ing more Justices to our Nation’s high-
est Court. 
Twenty-nine of the Commission’s 34 
members were liberals. But even with 
this 
supermajority 
of 
left-leaning 
scholars, the Commissioners still ex-
pressed their ‘‘profound disagreement 
over whether Court expansion at this 
moment in time would be wise.’’ 
If you can believe it, many Demo-
crats in Congress are fond of saying 
that expanding the Supreme Court for 
political reasons is actually unpacking 
it. 
Representative JERRY
NADLER, the 
Democrat from New York who chairs 
the House Judiciary Committee, has 
claimed that unpacking the Court by 
expanding it would ‘‘restore balance’’ 
and that Senate Democrats ‘‘should 
immediately move to expand the Su-
preme Court.’’ 
I want to be as clear as I can about 
this. Adding Justices to the Supreme 
Court of the United States simply be-
cause you don’t like some of the deci-
sions they make—that is Court pack-
ing. 
President Franklin Roosevelt ex-
plored this idea in the 1930s, after the 
Supreme Court struck down key parts 
of the New Deal. 
President Biden’s Commission’s own 
report called FDR’s attempt to pack 
the Court a ‘‘needless, futile, and ut-
terly dangerous abandonment of con-
stitutional principle.’’ 
No 
President 
has 
been 
reckless 
enough or shortsighted enough to push 
for it since FDR. President Biden said

he was not a fan of Court packing dur-
ing his campaign, but then he back-
tracked and said he was open to the 
idea. 
Giving in to pressure from the far- 
left wing of his party, he created this 
Commission instead, leaving the prob-
lem of taking a position on this issue 
for another more politically conven-
ient day. 
As the Commission’s report details, 
Court packing is often used as a polit-
ical weapon in authoritarian regimes, 
not in the United States of America. 
Take Venezuela, where Hugo Chavez 
cemented support for his socialist poli-
cies by expanding the country’s Su-
preme Tribunal of Justice from 20 
members to 32 members back in 2004. 
Look at all the good that did for what 
was once the wealthiest country in 
South America. 
We need to leave this practice to dic-
tatorships, where it belongs. Republics, 
like the United States, simply don’t 
engage in this kind of behavior. 
As the Commission’s report says, sta-
ble 
democracies 
‘‘have 
retained 
a 
strong commitment to judicial inde-
pendence.’’ Packing the Supreme Court 
would take an ax to that tradition of 
judicial independence. 
The United States is the greatest 
country on Earth because of our re-
spect for the rule of law, not in spite of 
it. 
And in light of this report, a resolu-
tion I cosponsored earlier this year 
that would fix the number of Supreme 
Court Justices at nine is even more im-
portant, and I would like to thank 
Florida’s senior Senator for leading the 
way on this. 
In the American system of separation 
of powers and checks and balances, our 
role here in Congress is to make laws, 
not to interpret them. That is the job 
of our courts, and their independence 
in doing that job is absolutely vital. 
As the Commissioners write in their 
report courts ‘‘cannot serve as effective 
checks on government officials if their 
personnel can be altered by those same 
government officials.’’ That is a bipar-
tisan group writing that—a bipartisan 
group where liberals outnumbered con-
servatives nearly 6 to 1. 
We cannot pack the Supreme Court. 
President Biden needs to put an end to 
this dangerous idea once and for all. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
CAMPUS FREE SPEECH 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
many times my fellow Senators have 
heard me say that my definition of a 
university is a place where controversy 
ought to run rampant. The point of 
going to college is not for all students 
to come out thinking exactly the same 
way. College is for ideas to be chal-
lenged. To weed out ideas we disagree 
with, we need open debate, not to shut 
down the conversation. Students of all 
stripes should be able to say what is on 
their mind. 
Institutional free speech should not 
be partisan. You can have partisan dis-
cussions, but the merely speaking of it, 
right or wrong, you agree or disagree, 
should not be a partisan issue or even 
be a controversial issue. Everyone is 
hurt if ideas are not frankly discussed 
by the next generation. 
Thankfully, Iowa has recognized this 
reality. So this spring, Governor Rey-
nolds signed a bill into law that helps 
codify free expression in Iowa’s public 
colleges. 
Now, it sometimes feels like Wash-
ington, DC, can forget common sense 
on this issue as well as a lot of other 
issues. But in Des Moines, the bill 
passed both chambers of the Iowa Leg-
islature with just 1 single ‘‘no’’ vote 
out of 150 senators and representatives. 
But here we are nationally. We seem 
to be heading in the wrong direction in 
regard to free speech on campus and 
discussion of some controversial issues. 
As recent as 2016, majorities of stu-
dents were confident that the First 
Amendment was secure, but now it 
looks like there has been a chilling ef-
fect on too many campuses. 
According to a more recent poll, 80 
percent of the students now say that 
they self-censor. In other words, 80 per-
cent of the students are afraid to voice 
and give their support or opposition on 
certain issues. Hostility to freedom of 
expression is being heard loud and 
clear by our students. 
But somehow it doesn’t seem like the 
donors seem to be listening to what is 
happening on these college campuses. I 
have tried to highlight this overlooked 
group of donors in the free speech de-
bate. Students and faculty are limited 
by the threat of getting canceled on 
campus. But donors have much more 
sway if they want to take advantage of 
it. 
Now, it seems, unfortunately, these 
alumnae don’t seem to consider free 
speech when they make a decision to 
donate, because their donation would 
have some power behind it if they 
would take the time to say what they 
think about how universities ought to 
be an environment where controversy 
runs rampant. 
We have a poll of donors to one col-
lege that found that the vast majority 
thought that freedom of expression 
should be a priority on campus, but 
only 20 percent said it was clear their 
alma mater protects speech in prac-
tice. Now, this is among donors, those 
who have already given despite their 
concerns. That is despite donations 
representing up to 19 percent of college 
budgets. 
There are more examples than I can 
count of donors withholding contribu-
tions and making real concrete change. 
Donors have stopped speakers from 
being deplatformed and overrode the 
veto of the crowd. 
It is time to stop pretending that 
alumni have no say. Earlier this year, 
I joined the Campus Free Speech Cau-
cus here in the Congress. That caucus 
tries to preserve this trend. I am also a 
cosponsor of the Campus Free Speech 
Resolution, which urges greater First 
Amendment protection in America’s 
universities. 
But this is not a problem that can be 
solved by any bill in the Senate. 
Thankfully, that tide is starting to 
turn. One of the first colleges to make 
a move was the University of Chicago. 
In 2015, the university president sent a 
statement on free expression to the in-
coming freshmen. He showed in that 
letter how both sides of the aisle are 
hurt when campuses clamp down on 
open debate. He called out what are 
considered 
‘‘trigger 
warnings’’ 
and 
‘‘safe spaces’’ while praising academic 
freedom. 
Now other colleges in our country 
are slowly starting to follow suit. So 
far, 75 schools have released similar 
statements, but, of course, 75 schools is 
only a fraction of all the colleges in the 
United States. 
To continue this progress we need in-
dividual Americans to make their 
voices heard. Ultimately, being a de-
mocracy means that we are able to lis-
ten to each other and do it civilly. We 
ought to be able to respectfully talk 
about where we agree and disagree, not 
sweep those disagreements under the 
rug and, in the process, silence those 
who do have the guts to speak out. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TRIBUTE TO FRANCIS S. COLLINS 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, Dr. 
Francis Collins, the Director of the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, will retire 
this month after serving as the Direc-
tor since 2009. That will be 12 years in 
one of the most challenging jobs in 
Washington, maybe even in the world. 
Dr. Collins served under three Presi-
dents in that job. No other person has 
served under more than one President. 
During that 12 years, certainly there 
had 
been 
amazing 
advances 
in 
healthcare. 
As a Washington Post reporter put it, 
and this was a quote from his article, 
‘‘News that Francis Collins is stepping 
down as Director of the National Insti-
tutes of Health is a bit like hearing 
that Santa Claus is handing off his 
reindeer reins.’’ This is the time of 
year to think about that. 
When he announced his retirement 
earlier this year, it was certainly fol-
lowed by a flood of comments from the 
scientific community. They used words 
like ‘‘brilliant,’’ ‘‘national treasure,’’ 
‘‘smartest man in any room,’’ ‘‘be-
loved,’’ and ‘‘gentleman.’’ I would also 
echo those words. I think I would add, 
from the great opportunities I have had 
to work with him and spend time with 
him, ‘‘straightforward,’’ ‘‘kind,’’ ‘‘re-
spected.’’ By the way, he never seems

December 15, 2021 
to need to act like the smartest person 
in any room even if and when he is. 
You know, throughout the 12 years 
he has been Director, he has made 
countless contributions to biomedical 
research and public health. Under his 
leadership, 
the 
NIH 
started 
groundbreaking research programs like 
the BRAIN Initiative, which is aimed 
at revolutionizing our understanding of 
the human brain, and the All of Us Pre-
cision Medicine Initiative, which is a 
historic effort to try to tailor medical 
care to the individual, and we see that 
is where medical care is going. 
As the Director of the NIH, Francis 
presided over the creation of the Na-
tional 
Center 
for 
Advancing 
Translational Sciences, which trans-
lates basic science discoveries into 
cures. He started the Cancer Moonshot 
and the Accelerating Medicines Part-
nership and increased investment in 
Alzheimer’s and opioid research. He 
also steered the U.S. Research Enter-
prise during a once-in-a-lifetime infec-
tious disease pandemic. Without his vi-
sion and leadership, we may not have 
been able to develop and deliver several 
FDA-approved COVID vaccines, COVID 
therapies, and diagnostic tests in less 
than a year. 
We wouldn’t want to forget that this 
wasn’t the first major health challenge 
that Dr. Collins navigated us through. 
He also led the responses to the H1N1 
flu outbreak in 2009 and to the 2014 and 
2015 Ebola outbreak. It does sort of 
make you wonder why he was still 
there when this pandemic came along, 
but, again, we are fortunate that he 
was. 
His impact on health and healthcare 
really didn’t start when he became the 
NIH Director. In fact, before becoming 
Director, he made significant contribu-
tions to the research field of genetics. 
He codiscovered the gene that causes 
cystic fibrosis, and he found genes for 
Huntington’s disease and type 2 diabe-
tes. 
Maybe his most significant scientific 
contribution was to head the Human 
Genome Project, which mapped and 
sequenced the full human genome for 
the first time. That monumental effort 
has allowed scientists to unlock some 
of the great mysteries of human life. It 
has created the potential to develop 
treatments and cures for some of our 
most serious diseases. What it has real-
ly done is to have allowed us to begin 
to think about personalized medicine— 
realizing that every person is different 
than every other person and that ev-
erybody has the capacity to fight back 
against any disease that challenges 
them. Usually, the disease can quickly 
overwhelm that capacity, which is why 
the addition of immunotherapy and the 
addition of personalized medicine are 
such critical tools for today. 
His work had a tremendous impact at 
the time, and it will have an even 
greater impact. We can see that impact 
as we move forward and look at how we 
need to look at personalized medicine. 
All of this has been accomplished in a 
way wherein very few scientists, I 
think, could have had the articulation 
of vision that Francis has to share it in 
a way that people can not only begin to 
understand these concepts but buy into 
the concepts. 
Certainly, one of the proudest accom-
plishments I had in the Senate with 
him was in working to increase NIH 
funding. When I became chairman of 
that committee 7 years ago, we had a 
10-year stagnation, really, in funding. 
In working with Senator DURBIN, who 
was here earlier this morning and 
talked about Dr. Collins—I tried to 
grab, 
to 
join, 
that 
moment 
but 
couldn’t—and with Senator Alexander 
and Senator MURRAY on our side of the 
building and many others and in work-
ing with Congressman COLE and now- 
Chairwoman DELAURO
of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations on the other 
side, we just decided we were going to 
make NIH research a priority and, over 
the next 7 years, increase funding by 43 
percent at a time when so many things 
were happening so quickly. 
Francis Collins, of course, not only 
was part of sharing that goal but, 
frankly, was also part of saying: Don’t 
come up with a goal where, when you 
get there, you are going to stop. Let’s 
keep moving forward as long as we are 
making the kinds of scientific ad-
vances that we know the country needs 
to make and the world needs to make. 
And we are doing that. 
Finally, he may be remembered the 
most in many cases for the hope he 
just has been able to bring to patients 
and communities. He is a physician. He 
is a scientist. He has been the Director 
of NIH, as I said, for 12 years. But part 
of his real ability is the ability to 
share who he is and to share the poten-
tial of science. 
During the time of COVID, we saw 
Francis coming up with songs and 
other ways to really focus on the pan-
demic and the way we need to respond 
to that pandemic. He is an incredibly 
skillful person. His legacy, I think, will 
live through generations of research-
ers. He has inspired the countless lives 
he has touched. His impact will be felt 
for a long time. 
I just want to say, on behalf of all of 
my colleagues—all of whom have been 
part of that progress of making NIH 
and health research a priority—thank 
you, Francis, for your leadership, for 
your friendship, and for your public 
service. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, be-
fore I start my remarks, I would like to 
thank the Senator from Missouri and 
add my thanks to Dr. Francis Collins 
for his leadership and for his contribu-
tions to our country, to our country’s 
future, and for his reassurance during 
very difficult times. 
I thank Senator BLUNT for so elo-
quently recognizing Dr. Collins. 
NOMINATION OF SAMANTHA D. ELLIOTT 
Madam President, I also rise today to 
support Samantha Elliott’s nomination 
to serve on the U.S. District Court for 
the District of New Hampshire. 
Our court system was established to 
serve as an independent arbiter that 
would deliver equal justice under the 
law, and our democracy requires an 
independent and impartial judiciary 
for us to continue moving forward as a 
nation. I am confident that, if con-
firmed, Samantha Elliott will bring 
the necessary impartiality, experience, 
and commitment to justice to the Fed-
eral bench. 
A resident of Concord, NH, Ms. El-
liott has spent years representing 
Granite Staters and has been a leader 
within the New Hampshire legal com-
munity. In her legal practice, she has 
represented clients at every level of 
New Hampshire’s State court, the U.S. 
District Court for the District of New 
Hampshire, and the First Circuit Court 
of Appeals. 
Throughout her career, Ms. Elliott 
has earned the respect and admiration 
of those within the legal community. 
With the support of her peers, she has 
been selected for inclusion in the ‘‘Best 
Lawyers in America’’ as well as in the 
‘‘New England Super Lawyers.’’ These 
awards are a testament to the reputa-
tion that she has built in and outside 
the courtroom. 
For this role on the U.S. District 
Court for the District of New Hamp-
shire in particular, members of the 
American Bar Association’s Standing 
Committee unanimously found Ms. El-
liott to be ‘‘well qualified’’—a distinc-
tion that reflects Ms. Elliott’s integ-
rity, 
professional 
competence, 
and 
temperament. 
I also want to note Ms. Elliott’s im-
pressive record of using her profes-
sional expertise to give back to her 
community and to our State. She has 
served on the board of New Hampshire 
Legal Assistance and with the Legal 
Advice and Referral Center, which is 
dedicated to providing legal services to 
low-income Granite Staters. This year, 
she became cochair of the founding 
board of directors for 603 Legal Aid— 
another critical resource and legal sup-
port system for those in need. She has 
taken on all of these roles while also 
fulfilling leadership roles within her 
own firm and tending to a robust legal 
practice of her own. 
Members of New Hampshire’s small 
and tight-knit legal community marvel 
at Ms. Elliott’s time management 
skills as well as her wide-ranging prac-
tice and capacity as an attorney. But 
what drives her colleagues’ respect and 
admiration is her clear-eyed and pas-
sionate commitment to ensuring that 
everyone in our democracy has access 
to justice and her understanding that 
lawyers are privileged to be able to 
provide it. 
Samantha Elliott will be a fair-
minded, balanced, and intellectually 
curious judge who will serve Granite 
Staters with distinction on the U.S. 
District Court for the District of New 
Hampshire. I look forward to voting in 
favor of her nomination, and I urge all 
of my colleagues to do the same.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9180 
December 15, 2021 
I know that my colleague Senator 
SHAHEEN is here today to speak about 
Ms. Elliott’s experience as well. 
I yield the floor to the Senator. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 5 minutes before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am really pleased to join my colleague 
Senator HASSAN to speak in support of 
Samantha Elliott’s nomination to the 
Federal District Court for the District 
of New Hampshire. 
As we heard from Senator HASSAN, 
Samantha Elliott has had an amazing 
public service career. Her professional 
experience and commitment to ensur-
ing equal access to justice make her 
eminently qualified to serve on the 
Federal bench. She will make an excel-
lent addition to the Federal district 
court in New Hampshire. 
Now, Samantha actually came to the 
practice of law in a less traditional 
way. She started out first as a writer 
for magazines before she and her hus-
band flipped a coin to see who would go 
to law school. After graduating from 
Columbia Law School—she obviously 
won the toss—she joined Gallagher, 
Callahan and Gartrell, a law firm in 
Concord, our capital city. 
Since 
becoming 
an 
attorney, 
Samantha has litigated before Federal 
and State courts, handling an impres-
sive collection of matters that involves 
complex areas of law. She has also 
served in a variety of leadership posi-
tions at her firm, including serving as 
president for 5 years. 
During 
the 
selection 
process, 
Samantha always came back to the im-
portance of equal access to justice, say-
ing at one point: ‘‘No one closes or 
opens doors to access to justice like a 
judge does.’’ Samantha knows first-
hand, through her extensive work with 
the New Hampshire legal aid commu-
nity, just how correct that saying is. 
For 9 years, she served on the joint 
board of the New Hampshire Legal As-
sistance and the Legal Advice and Re-
ferral Center, and she has held various 
roles 
on 
its 
executive 
committee. 
Samantha has also spent more than 21⁄2 
years on a special committee that has 
met every other Monday to revisit the 
structure of legal aid in New Hamp-
shire. Just think about that—every 
other Monday for 21⁄2 years to better re-
structure legal aid in New Hampshire. 
These tireless efforts culminated in the 
creation of 603 Legal Aid, which is a 
new entity that will increase access to 
justice for New Hampshire’s low-in-
come residents. 
Samantha 
has 
consistently 
dem-
onstrated her commitment to ensuring 
that everyone has access to justice no 
matter what their socioeconomic sta-
tus. As a result of her commitment, 
her tenacity, and her respect for the 
law, Samantha’s nomination has gar-
nered widespread support throughout 
the New Hampshire legal community, 
including from Chuck Douglas, who is 
a former Republican Representative to 
Congress and New Hampshire Supreme 
Court Justice. Now, he has only ever 
faced Samantha as an adversary in liti-
gation, but he said she is an ‘‘excellent 
lawyer who is creative and diligent and 
exhibits the highest standards of our 
profession.’’ 
In addition to former Justice Doug-
las, Samantha’s nomination is sup-
ported by a diverse collection of attor-
neys and others in the New Hampshire 
legal community, including the New 
Hampshire Women’s Bar Association; 
Judge Gary Hicks, who is a current su-
preme court justice in New Hampshire, 
a senior associate; and George Moore, 
the executive director of the New 
Hampshire Bar Association, to name 
just a few of those who have weighed in 
with letters of support. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have these letters of support 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NEW HAMPSHIRE WOMEN’S BAR 
ASSOCIATION, 
October 4, 2021. 
Re: Nomination of Samantha Elliott to the 
United States District Court for the Dis-
trict of New Hampshire 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DURBIN AND RANKING MEM-
BER GRASSLEY: On behalf of the unanimous 
Board of Directors of the New Hampshire 
Women’s Bar Association, and in my per-
sonal capacity as her law partner, I write, 
collectively with the Board, in support of 
Samantha 
Elliott’s 
nomination 
for 
the 
United States District Court for the District 
of New Hampshire. We urge the Committee 
and full Senate to promptly review and con-
firm her nomination. 
Since admission to the bar, Attorney El-
liott has spent her entire legal career prac-
ticing in New Hampshire. She has rep-
resented plaintiffs and defendants, individ-
uals, corporations, and governmental enti-
ties. She has handled matters in nearly all 
areas of civil practice, such as commercial 
disputes, employment and discrimination, 
product liability, property rights, and mu-
nicipal defense in civil rights litigation. She 
has successfully represented clients in litiga-
tion, trials, and appeals in every New Hamp-
shire state court, the United States District 
Court for the District of New Hampshire, and 
the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
In addition to her legal work, Attorney El-
liott has dedicated over a decade towards 
volunteer board work in service to legal aid, 
first with New Hampshire Legal Assistance 
and the Legal Advice and Referral Center, 
and then 603 Legal Aid. Attorney Elliott fre-
quently speaks on lawyers’ continuing legal 
education panels, including multiple years 
with the Federal Practice Institute. She is 
an active member of the American Inns of 
Court, and has served on both the New 
Hampshire Court Accreditation Commission 
and the Federal Court Advisory Committee. 
The New Hampshire Women’s Bar Associa-
tion Board of Directors strongly supports At-
torney Elliott’s nomination to the federal 
bench. Attorney Elliott is an outstanding 
member of our legal community. She pos-
sesses the mental acumen and temperament 
to decide matters fairly and impartially. She 
would be an asset to the federal judiciary, 
and we strongly recommend her appoint-
ment. 
Sincerely, 
Caroline K. Leonard, NHWBA President

diate Past President; Katherine E. 
Hedges, Treasurer; Lyndsay N. Robin-

Re: Nomination of Samantha Elliott to the 
District Court of New Hampshire 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DURBIN AND RANKING MEM-
BER GRASSLEY: I am writing to support the 
nomination of Samantha Elliott of New 
Hampshire to be a United States District 
Judge for the District of New Hampshire. 
I served as a judge for over 10 years on the 
state Superior Court and the state Supreme 
Court and have practiced in the federal 
courts since I was admitted to the Bar in 
1968. I know what the job entails and that 
she will perform admirably. 
We currently have at least two cases in 
which Attorney Elliott is on the other side. 
I have never been in litigation with her other 
than as adversaries. She is an excellent law-
yer who is creative and diligent and exhibits 
the highest standards of our profession. She 
is well respected in the New Hampshire Bar 
and has served our legal aid and legal assist-
ance programs for years. 
I have also dealt with her as a lobbyist for 
a pool of municipal governments. While we 
were adversaries for years over various im-
munities and governmental disputes with 
plaintiffs, she always kept her word and I 
could trust her to accurately convey our ne-
gotiated deals even if I were not present to 
submit them to a committee. That is an ex-
tremely rare quality, and one that is not 
general currency in our capital or yours. 
I have no hesitation supporting her nomi-
nation and know she will serve the judiciary 
well on our bench. 
By the way I enjoyed serving with then 
Congressman Durbin when I was in the 
House in 1989 and 1990. 
Sincerely, 
CHARLES G. DOUGLAS, III. 
OCTOBER 2, 2021. 
Re: Nomination of Samantha D. Elliott to 
the United States District Court for the 
District of New Hampshire 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DURBIN AND RANKING MEM-
BER GRASSLEY: We are writing in enthusi-
astic support of Samantha Elliott’s nomina-
tion to the United States District Court for 
the District of New Hampshire. Both of us 
have worked closely with Ms. Elliott over 
the past ten years to achieve the goal of 
equal access to justice for all in New Hamp-
shire. 
Deborah, a legal aid lawyer in Tennessee 
and New Hampshire in her early career, 
served as a judicial officer in New Hamp-
shire’s Superior Court and Family Division 
for 25 years. In 2013, following her retirement 
from the bench, Deborah joined the overlap-
ping Boards of New Hampshire Legal Assist-
ance (NHLA)and the Legal Advice & Referral 
Center (LARC) serving as Co-Chair of the 
Joint Board and then Chair of the LARC 
Board. Beginning in 2018, Deborah spear-
headed the Statewide Planning Committee,

December 15, 2021 
created to improve the delivery of quality 
legal services to low income and disadvan-
taged residents of New Hampshire. This 
three-year effort resulted in the merger of 
LARC and the NH Bar Association’s Pro 
Bono Program into 603 Legal Aid, collabo-
rating in partnership with NHLA. Ms. Elliott 
and Deborah have worked closely over the 
past five years, as Co-Chairs of the overlap-
ping Boards, and during this intense three- 
year Statewide Planning commitment. Debo-
rah is now a founding member of the 603 
Legal Aid Board, of which Ms. Elliott is the 
founding Co-Chair. 
John is currently a legal aid consultant 
and NH school funding advocate. He worked 
for 38 years at NHLA New Hampshire Legal 
Assistance as a staff attorney and managing 
attorney before serving for 18 years as the 
program’s. Executive Director until his re-
tirement in 2014. During his time at NHLA 
he played a leadership role in advocacy for 
equal justice in New Hampshire, in the New 
England region, and nationally. He was Ex-
ecutive Director of NHLA during the begin-
ning of Ms. Elliott’s term on the overlapping 
Boards of NHLA and the Legal Advice and 
Referral Center (LARC). 
We have observed Ms. Elliott’s superior in-
tellect and communication skills, and we 
have seen how others respond to her meas-
ured and perceptive analysis of difficult 
problems. We know how respected she is 
among her fellow Board members and the 
staff of NHLA, LARC, and now 603 Legal Aid, 
who have relied on her good and ethical judg-
ment in the governance of these organiza-
tions. And we have been impressed with her 
work ethic, her focus, her humanity, and her 
integrity. She possesses in great abundance 
the intelligence, ethical grounding, and tem-
perament that are vital to being a fair and 
effective judge. 
While we admire her intellect and her 
character, from our perspective as legal aid 
leaders we want to emphasize Ms. Elliott’s 
extraordinary fidelity to the concept of 
equal justice and her commitment to seeing 
that everyone has the opportunity to access 
this basic American value, no matter their 
position in society. The amount of time and 
energy that Ms. Elliott has devoted to the 
cause of equal justice is immeasurable. De-
spite the demands of a busy law practice, Ms. 
Elliott has unsparingly committed herself to 
assuring that New Hampshire’s legal aid or-
ganizations are well-managed and highly col-
laborative, so that they can deliver quality 
legal services to the poor. She has used her 
stellar reputation in the legal community to 
recruit prominent lawyers to support access 
to justice efforts, whether in leadership posi-
tions, as advocates, or as donors. She has 
volunteered her own legal services by assist-
ing the Boards in understanding their fidu-
ciary responsibilities and providing advice 
on other legal matters. She has developed re-
lationships with the executive leadership of 
NHLA, LARC, and 603 Legal Aid, nurturing 
mutual trust and mutual commitment to 
mission. And she has advocated in multiple 
forums, including at the NH Supreme Court 
and in the NH Legislature, in support of ev-
eryone’s right to justice and dignity in our 
legal system. 
We hope that you will consider this nomi-
nation favorably. We are confident that, as a 
judge, Ms. Elliott will be highly competent 
and deeply compassionate. We know that she 
will treat everyone who appears before her 
with the respect they deserve from our judi-
cial system, regardless of their social status 
or identity. And, as a member of the federal 
bench, she will have the opportunity to bring 
our court system closer to the goal of equal 
access to justice for all.

merly Concord, NH).

Re: The nomination of Samantha Elliott to 
the District Court for the United States 
District of New Hampshire 
DEAR CHAIRMAN DURBIN AND RANKING MEM-
BER GRASSLEY: I write in support of the nom-
ination of Samantha Elliott to serve as a 
judge on the United States District Court for 
the District of New Hampshire. I urge the 
committee and full Senate to promptly re-
view and confirm her nomination. I have 
worked with Attorney Elliott on a number of 
matters over the years and found her to be 
an exceedingly excellent trial lawyer and ad-
vocate for both plaintiffs and defendants. 
She is extraordinarily bright, personable, 
and has a great temperament to be on the 
bench. In the course of her career, she also 
served as managing partner of her law firm. 
In addition, I worked very closely with At-
torney Elliott in her capacity as a Board 
Member for New Hampshire Legal Assistance 
and Legal Advice and Referral Center. To-
gether, we recently merged the Bar Associa-
tion’s Pro Bono program with the Legal Ad-
vice and Referral Center to create a new 
statewide entity to serve indigent citizens. 
The new organization’s name is 603 Legal 
Aid, and it was Attorney Elliott’s determina-
tion, forthrightness, and ability to bring var-
ious stakeholders to the table that ensured 
that our efforts would be successful. There is 
no doubt that she will bring the same en-
ergy, judgment, and intellectual capacity to 
the federal bench. 
In closing, I respectfully submit my strong 
support for Samantha Elliott and request 
the committee and full Senate to promptly 
review and confirm her nomination to this 
important position.

Re: Samantha Elliott 
DEAR SENATOR DURBIN: I welcome this op-
portunity to support the nomination of 
Samantha Elliott. I have practiced law in 
New Hampshire since 1977, first with the New

1981 in private practice. My principal areas 
of work are plaintiff’s employment law and 
civil rights. Attorney Elliott has been de-
fense counsel in several of my cases. In my 
experience, she is very knowledgeable of the 
law, has excellent legal skills, and works 
hard to achieve a fair outcome. Notwith-
standing her defense counsel role, she has 
demonstrated a capacity to empathize with 
the plaintiff. 
She has a strong commitment to securing 
equal protection and justice. Equally impor-

welcoming demeanor which would make her 
courtroom a great place to practice law.

DEAR CHAIRMAN DURBIN AND RANKING MEM-
BER GRASSLEY: It is with much pleasure that 
I write to you in support of Attorney 
Samantha Elliott. My knowledge of her 
qualifications derives from ten years of per-
sonal observations including: multiple argu-
ments before our court; active participation 
in our Daniel Webster Inns of Court; and her 
remarkable public service. 
Attorney Elliott has earned an exalted po-
sition among New Hampshire lawyers. She 
has the wisdom, the patience, and the sense 
of humor necessary to become one of the fin-
est District Court judges to sit in our life-
time. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you 
would like any further information. 
Very truly yours, 
GARY E. HICKS, 
Senior Associate Justice. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. I am confident that 
Samantha’s passion for the law and 
dedication to the impartial administra-
tion of justice will make her an excel-
lent judge, and I urge my colleagues to 
support her nomination.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. WAR-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I 
come to the floor at a time when, I be-
lieve, as of today, there are 72 nomi-
nees for State Department and USAID 
positions here in Washington and over-
seas pending on the Senate floor. 
I am going to make a series of unani-
mous consent requests. I am first going 
to proceed to one to which there will 
likely be one objection. Then I will 
give a few minutes of remarks and then 
give additional ones. 
I ask unanimous consent that not-
withstanding rule XXII, if applicable, 
at a time to be determined by the ma-
jority leader in consultation with the 
Republican leader, the Senate proceed 
to executive session to consider Execu-
tive Calendar No. 239, Michele Jeanne 
Sison, of Maryland, a Career Member 
of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of 
Career Ambassador, to be an Assistant 
Secretary of State (International Orga-
nization Affairs); that there be 10 min-
utes for debate, equally divided in the 
usual form on the nomination; that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate proceed to vote without in-
tervening action or debate; and that if 
the nomination is confirmed, the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table and no further 
motions be in order on the nomination; 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action and the 
Senate then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I object. 
Madam President, it is now Decem-
ber. It has been nearly 4 months since 
the disastrous withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. 
Thirteen servicemembers lost their 
lives in the attack on Abbey Gate 
along with hundreds of civilians. As a 
result of the botched evacuation oper-
ation, hundreds, if not thousands, of 
American civilians were left behind to 
the enemy. 
We hear from our friends on the 
other side of the aisle that my insist-
ence that we actually vote on nominees 
is unprecedented. I would humbly sug-
gest that the crisis into which this 
President has led this country is un-
precedented. In my lifetime, it is un-
precedented. 
And who has been held accountable 
for this disaster? No one. Who has the 
President fired? Who has offered their 
resignation? Which of the planners at 
the Department of State or the Depart-
ment of Defense or the National Secu-
rity Council have been relieved of 
duty? No one. 
Until there is accountability, I am 
going to ask that the Senate do the 
simple task of its job, which is to actu-
ally vote on these nominees. The least 
we could do is observe regular order 
and vote on these leadership positions 
at the Department of State and at the 
Department of Defense. 
My colleagues say that we have got 
to put national security first. I agree 
with them about that. But I believe 
that begins at the top, with the Presi-
dent of the United States and the lead-
ership of the Department of Defense 
and the Department of State. I, for 
one, am not going to stand by and look 
the other way while this administra-
tion systematically endangers our na-
tional security, imperils the American 
people, and watches the sacrifice of our 
soldiers go by without any account-
ability, without any change in direc-
tion. 
I am not willing to look the other 
way and just pretend that Afghanistan 
didn’t happen, which seems to be the 
posture that many in this body have 
adopted. I am not willing to do that. I 
can’t do that because I promised the 
parents of the fallen that I wouldn’t do 
that. 
I am going to discharge my responsi-
bility. And as long as it takes, I will 
continue to draw attention to what 
happened at Abbey Gate and to demand 
accountability for the disaster that 
this administration has pushed upon 
this country and upon the people of my 
State. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, at a 
time when we need senior people to 
help our country deter adversaries, ad-
vance our interests, and secure our val-
ues, it is important that all the nomi-
nees currently waiting on this floor be 
confirmed. 
They are well qualified. Eight of 
them would serve under the jurisdic-
tion of my Subcommittee on the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee in 
various multilateral organizations and 
in economic and energy policy. 
I understand and I respect the right 
of colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to seek amendments on votes like the 
Nord Stream 2 issue. I, for one, would 
be happy to vote on additional subjects 
around foreign policy and national se-
curity, and I pushed for additional 
votes during the National Defense Au-
thorization Act floor process. 
These national security issues are 
important, and this Chamber owes to 
the American people robust debate, but 
we also need to provide advice and con-
sent on any President’s nominees in a 
purposeful and timely manner. 
With that in mind, in a few moments, 
I will officially ask unanimous consent 
to confirm the following nominees: 
Jack A. Markell, of Delaware, to be 
Representative of the United States of 
America to the Organization for Eco-
nomic Cooperation and Development, 
with the rank of Ambassador; R. Nich-
olas Burns, of Massachusetts, to be 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Pleni-
potentiary of the United States of 
America to the People’s Republic of 
China; Rahm Emanuel, of Illinois, to be 
Ambassador Extraordinary and Pleni-
potentiary of the United States of 
America to Japan; Steven C. Bondy, of 
New Jersey, a Career Member of the 
Senior Foreign Service, Class of Min-
ister-Counselor, to be Ambassador Ex-
traordinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to the King-
dom of Bahrain; Cynthia Ann Telles, of 
California, to be Ambassador Extraor-
dinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to the Repub-
lic of Costa Rica; Bathsheba Nell 
Crocker, of the District of Columbia, to 
be Representative of the United States 
of America to the Office of the United 
Nations and Other International Orga-
nizations in Geneva, with the rank of 
Ambassador; Christopher P. Lu, of Vir-
ginia, to be Representative of the 
United States of America to the United 
Nations for U.N. Management and Re-
form, with the rank of Ambassador; 
Christopher P. Lu, of Virginia, to be an 
Alternate Representative of the United 
States of America to the Sessions of 
the General Assembly of the United 
Nations, during his tenure of service as 
Representative of the United States of 
America to the United Nations for U.N. 
Management 
and 
Reform; 
Lisa 
A. 
Carty, of Maryland, to be Representa-
tive of the United States of America on 
the Economic and Social Council of the 
United Nations, with the rank of Am-
bassador; Lisa A. Carty, of Maryland, 
to be an Alternate Representative of 
the United States of America to the 
Sessions of the General Assembly of 
the United Nations, during her tenure 
of service as Representative of the 
United States of America on the Eco-
nomic and Social Council of the United 
Nations; Laura S. H. Holgate, of Vir-
ginia, to be Representative of the 
United States of America to the Vi-
enna Office of the United Nations, with 
the rank of Ambassador; Laura S. H. 
Holgate, of Virginia, to be Representa-
tive of the United States of America to

the International Atomic Energy Agen-
cy, with the rank of Ambassador; C.S. 
Eliot Kang, of New Jersey, to be an As-
sistant 
Secretary 
of 
State 
(Inter-
national Security and Non-Prolifera-
tion); Adam Scheinman, of Virginia, to 
be Special Representative of the Presi-
dent for Nuclear Nonproliferation, with 
the rank of Ambassador. 
I am going to ask unanimous consent 
for all of these because they are crit-
ical to our foreign policy and our na-
tional security. 
And I must say at the outset, I have 
appreciated the opportunity to dia-
logue with my colleagues about a pos-
sible path forward, but as of right now, 
we don’t have one, so I am seeking this 
unanimous consent. 
Principal among the many nominees 
I just spoke about is my dear friend, 
Jack Markell. I would like to turn to 
my colleague, also from the State of 
Delaware, for a few minutes of remarks 
about this wonderful public servant we 
have both known for decades. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from the Commonwealth of 
Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. The Commonwealth of 
Delaware? 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
State of Delaware. I am sorry. 
Mr. CARPER. The first State. The 
first State to ratify the Constitution 
before anyone else did. It made Dela-
ware the first State and the only State 
for a whole week. 
Jack Markell was a great Governor. I 
would like to say he is one of the two 
best Governors we have ever had. As a 
former Governor, you know what I am 
talking about. 
Madam President, I rise today to ask 
unanimous consent to confirm Dela-
ware’s own Jack Markell as Ambas-
sador to the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development better 
known as the OECD. 
I have had the privilege of knowing 
Jack for over two decades as a stead-
fast Governor—a brilliant Governor, 
actually—of the State of Delaware, 
chairman of the National Governors 
Association, and as a prudent State 
treasurer for our State; someone who 
had a great career in the world of busi-
ness, most recently as a compassionate 
Coordinator for Operation Allies, lead-
ing the national effort to resettle Af-
ghan refugees across the United States. 
Jack is someone whom I deeply re-
spect as a public servant and whom I 
admire as a father, as a husband, and 
as a son. 
After being referred out of com-
mittee by voice vote, he is someone 
whom Senators from both sides of the 
aisle trust to serve as a steward for 
American interests abroad. 
I am confident Jack will serve the 
United States with great distinction as 
our top diplomat to the OECD, and I 
am honored to introduce him, if you 
will, here today on the Senate floor. 
There are some people who might not 
know just what the OECD does and the 
important role it plays keeping our 
world 
leaders 
informed 
and 
their 
economies thriving. 
Somebody asked me what is my fa-
vorite part of my job, and I tell them it 
is helping people. They ask: How do 
you like to help people? 
I say I like to help make sure they 
have a job, to make sure people have a 
job and can support themselves and 
their family. That is about one of the 
best things you can do for them. 
The predecessor for the OECD—the 
Organisation for European Economic 
Co-operation—was founded in the rub-
ble of World War II to help European 
nations to serve and disburse funds re-
ceived from the Marshall Plan and to 
lift up the economies of the world. 
A little over a decade later, the orga-
nization was restructured. It was re-
structured to open up beyond the bor-
ders of Europe. In 1961, what we now 
know as the OECD was formed as a 
‘‘North Star,’’ if you will, for global 
economic research, publishing data and 
forecasts for economic stability in this 
interconnected world that we live in. 
Today, some 38 countries—38 demo-
cratic nations dedicated to free market 
principles—send Ambassadors to Paris 
every year to help lift up the econo-
mies of the world once more. It is a 
gathering place to seek out and to 
share solutions to economic problems 
and challenges and to strengthen our 
global leadership status. 
Yet, for the last 4 years, not only 
have we as a nation withdrawn from 
our seat at the international table, we 
stopped looking outward for solutions 
that can boost our own economy. It has 
been almost 5 years—in fact, since Jan-
uary 20, 2017—since we had a Senate- 
confirmed ambassador to the OECD—5 
years. Five years away from the table, 
our eyes closed to new solutions. That 
is particularly dangerous in the wake 
of an economic recession. I think it is 
foolish. It is beyond being foolish. 
Right now, the OECD could use some-
one like Jack Markell. He will do a 
great job representing our Nation, and 
he is ready to go to work. When I think 
of Jack Markell, I think a lot about 
the successes he had in the State of 
Delaware, serving three terms as State 
treasurer, a position I once held, and 
two as Governor. 
I also think of the great adversity he 
has been through. When he was first 
elected Governor of Delaware in No-
vember 2008, the housing bubble had 
burst, and our Nation entered the great 
recession. In an op-ed for the Atlantic 
in May of 2015, Jack recalled it was im-
mediately clear that his time as Gov-
ernor would be focused on one thing, 
and that would be job creation. 
And he was right. In the winter of his 
first year, the great recession brought 
unemployment in our State to 9 per-
cent—9 percent. In an instant, our 
economy was in free fall, along with 
the economies of many other States. 
The General Motors plant in Wil-
mington, the Chrysler plant in New-
ark—both in northern Delaware—the 
Valero refinery in Delaware City—all 
of these hubs for good-paying jobs for 
thousands and thousands of Delaware 
families shut down just like that. 
Workers across the State, whether an 
assembly line worker, a single parent 
working in the finance industry, or a 
family farm in our agricultural sec-
tor—every family felt the pain of that 
recession. 
But Jack didn’t shy away from the 
moment. He didn’t lose sight of what is 
important in the face of economic un-
certainty. Jack Markell knows all too 
well that in adversity lies opportunity. 
I think he learned that from Albert 
Einstein. In the face of great adversity, 
Jack Markell worked to court compa-
nies from all over the world to bring 
their businesses to Delaware, to bring 
jobs back, to retrain the employees 
who lost the jobs they had held for dec-
ades. He got Delaware back on the 
move, and the voters recognized his 
economic prowess by reelecting him by 
a wide margin in 2012. 
Over his two terms as Governor, 
Delaware’s unemployment rate came 
down significantly. In fact, Delaware 
had the best job growth in the region, 
bringing vital jobs back to Delaware 
families at places like the Delaware 
City Refinery, a project that I was 
proud to work with Jack on, and wages 
grew to be among the best in our coun-
try. 
Jack Markell was laser-focused on 
developing the workforce of our future 
too. Graduation rates improved, and 
Delaware launched something called 
Pathways to Prosperity, an innovative 
program in schools across America 
helping to better prepare students for a 
wide range of careers, whether they go 
to college or take a different path—a 
different path but a path to gainful em-
ployment. 
For 
8 
years 
as 
Governor, 
Jack 
worked with both sides of the aisle to 
get things done and improve the lives 
of Delawareans, and his legacy as Gov-
ernor of Delaware will be felt for gen-
erations. 
I oftentimes like to say that the 
roles of Presidents, the roles of Sen-
ators, Governors, and other elected of-
ficials is not to create jobs. Sometimes 
people talk about the jobs that they 
created as President, mayor, Senator, 
whatever. We don’t create jobs. What 
we do is we help create a nurturing en-
vironment for job creation. 
What Jack Markell has focused on 
for years—for decades, actually—is how 
to help many stakeholders in our State 
create a nurturing environment for job 
creation and job preservation. Jack un-
derstood this, and he will take that 
with him to Paris, with the memory of 
what looking to companies and coun-
tries across the world for solutions did 
to help families in Delaware. He will 
continue to look anywhere and every-
where to help American workers. 
Because of Jack’s lifelong learning, 
he spent literally decades thinking 
about how to bring more Americans 
into a more equitable, prosperous econ-
omy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9184 
December 15, 2021 
He learned the fundamentals of eco-
nomic development by studying devel-
opment 
studies 
and 
economics 
at 
Brown University and earned his mas-
ter’s of business administration at the 
University of Chicago Booth School of 
Business. 
He learned what businesses need to 
thrive by serving as a senior vice presi-
dent at Nextel Communications and 
later in a senior management position 
at Comcast. 
He learned about equity as State 
treasurer, where he led a campaign to 
promote the earned income tax credit 
for families and founded the Delaware 
Money School to offer free financial 
literacy 
classes 
to 
empower 
Dela-
wareans. 
He learned about the power of global 
economic solutions as Governor, bring-
ing vital jobs back to the State lit-
erally at the depth of the great reces-
sion. 
He learned how to lead with empa-
thy. By answering President Biden’s 
call to lead our Nation’s Afghan reset-
tlement operation, he embodied the 
core tenet of Matthew 25, and that is to 
welcome the stranger in our land and 
welcome our Afghan allies with open 
arms and open hearts. 
Jack Markell succeeded in no small 
part because he is a lifelong learner, 
and every step of the way, he has ex-
ceeded expectations for the people of 
Delaware because he has followed a 
simple but sacred maxim, and I would 
quote it: A good job trumps all. 
Before any politics in Washington or 
policy paper in Paris, he is worried 
about putting food on the table—and 
not just in Delaware but putting Amer-
icans back to work across the country 
so they can put food on their own ta-
bles. 
Today, as we continue to build back 
better in the wake of an economic re-
cession, we need someone who is con-
stantly willing to look out for solu-
tions to help find work for those at 
home because, after all, a good job 
trumps all. 
So today, the OECD could use some-
one like Jack Markell, someone to 
look for and bring with him global so-
lutions to the economic challenges of 
today. 
Before I yield the floor, I am re-
minded of a story from when Jack’s 
second term as Governor came to an 
end. He decided he wanted to find a 
way to raise money for Delaware’s chil-
dren on his way out. He settled on a 
novel idea—a 3300-mile bike ride across 
the country, from Astoria, OR, to Re-
hoboth Beach, DE, and along the way, 
across 50 days, averaging 80 miles a 
day. He raised something like $120,000 
for groups like the YMCA of Delaware, 
Special Olympics of Delaware, Boys 
and Girls Clubs of Delaware, and more. 
Of course, I worked just as hard as 
Jack during that trip. I jumped in my 
car and I drove 2 hours to Rehoboth 
Beach to meet him as he came across 
the finish line. 
He dipped his bicycle wheel—I think 
the front wheel—in the Atlantic Ocean, 
as he had dipped his rear wheel in the 
Pacific Ocean some, gosh, 50 days be-
fore. 
But that trip really shows you who 
Jack Markell is—proactive, thought-
ful, and more importantly for the 
OECD, always willing to look for new, 
creative ideas to help improve the lives 
of Americans and always willing to put 
in the work to get the job done. 
We still have a ways to go to get our 
Nation’s economy and the economies of 
our world where they need to be, where 
we want them to be, but I am confident 
that with Jack Markell at the helm at 
OECD on our behalf, we will be able to 
get to the finish line, no matter how 
long it takes. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to 
join my wingman in the Senate, Sen-
ator CHRIS COONS, and me in supporting 
Jack Markell to be our Ambassador to 
the OECD. 
With that, Madam President, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The jun-
ior Senator from the State of Dela-
ware. 
Mr. COONS. I want to thank my col-
league, the senior Senator from Dela-
ware. I, too, have known Governor 
Markell for decades, and I, too, was 
prepared to make long and fulsome 
comments about his remarkable record 
of achievement both as a leader in the 
private sector, as someone who actu-
ally did help create jobs by launching 
Nextel and by growing it to a remark-
able, world-class telecom company, and 
his leadership as State treasurer, to his 
leadership as Governor, but that has 
been covered in wonderful detail. 
His Pathways to Prosperity Program 
in Delaware I have recommended to 
colleagues of both parties as a model 
for how we might move forward on ap-
prenticeships and on skilling for the 
21st century and his current service as 
the President’s special adviser to lead 
Operation 
Allies 
Welcome. 
Senator 
CARPER and I just visited Fort Dix on 
Friday with Governor Markell to see 
the tremendous work of our Armed 
Forces and to visit with Afghan fami-
lies who have just been relocated to the 
United States. It is just a reminder of 
his great heart and his dedication to 
service. I am confident that he has the 
experience, intelligence, and character 
to serve admirably as our Ambassador 
to the OECD. 
All the individuals for whom I will 
call a unanimous consent request here 
in just a moment—I am confident that 
these are individuals nominated for po-
sitions critical to our national security 
interest and our ability to maintain 
our standing in key international orga-
nizations. 
Four of these nominees will be re-
sponsible for representing the United 
States at various U.N. bodies and three 
of them for leading work on nuclear en-
ergy nonproliferation, to promote en-
ergy security while protecting the 
American people from the proliferation 
of weapons of mass destruction. These 
are diplomats who will help the United 
States bolster and reform institutions 
so they can effectively withstand the 
steady 
march, 
the 
pressures 
of 
authoritarianism, and uphold our core 
values of human rights, labor rights, 
democracy, and transparent economic 
practices. 
In conclusion, I ask that we confirm 
these nominees today so they can move 
forward with representing our Nation, 
Governor Markell and many others. 
Several have been pending since April, 
more than 220 days; others, for 130 
days—since July. It is December. 
While I am hopeful that we can yet 
find a path forward towards a resolu-
tion of this impasse, today I was com-
mitted to coming to the floor and ask-
ing unanimous consent. We need to get 
these folks into their positions as soon 
as humanly possible. 
So I ask unanimous consent that not-
withstanding rule XXII, if applicable, 
at a time to be determined by the ma-
jority leader in consultation with the 
Republican leader, the Senate proceed 
to executive session to consider Execu-
tive Calendar Nos. 318, 319, 442, 446, 460, 
and 514; that there be 10 minutes for 
debate equally divided in the usual 
form on the nominations en bloc; that 
upon the use or yielding back of time, 
the Senate proceed to vote without in-
tervening action or debate on the 
nominations in the order listed; that if 
a nomination is confirmed, the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate; that no further mo-
tions be in order on these nominations; 
and that the President be immediately 
notified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I thank my friends from Delaware 
for their eloquent remarks. As both 
Senators know, I have a deep affinity 
for the State of Delaware. My mother 
was born in Wilmington, DE. I have 
hundreds of cousins in Delaware, who 
are their constituents. 
I would note that the senior Senator 
from Delaware, Senator CARPER, when 
I was newly elected, proceeded to wel-
come me into a caucus I didn’t know 
existed, the TC Caucus. Indeed, he and 
I both reflected upon this recently 
when we were both in Oklahoma for 
the funeral of our former colleague, 
Senator Tom Coburn, another member 
of the TC Caucus. 
I would note as well that Senator 
CARPER went so far as to call my moth-
er on her birthday to wish her happy 
birthday for having been born in Wil-
mington, and my mother appreciated 
that. 
The junior Senator from Delaware— 
we served together on multiple com-
mittees. We have worked together. We 
have sparred together. And we may 
well be able to work together in finding 
a resolution to this impasse. 
Every Senator here knows why I have 
holds on these nominees. Right now, as 
we speak, hundreds of thousands of 
Russian troops are massed on the bor-
der of the Ukraine, waiting to invade.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9185 
December 15, 2021 
The reason for that is because Joe 
Biden surrendered to Vladimir Putin 
on the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. That is 
the direct cause for the threat of mili-
tary invasion Ukraine faces right now. 
Putin didn’t just wake up one day 
and decide to invade Ukraine. He has 
wanted to invade Ukraine for years. In 
fact, he did so in 2014, but he stopped 
short of a full invasion because he 
needed to use the Ukrainian energy in-
frastructure to get Russian natural gas 
to the European market. Because of 
that—that is why Putin launched Nord 
Stream 2, to have a pipeline directly 
from Russia to Germany going under-
sea to cut Ukraine out of the transit 
loop, so then the Russian tanks could 
invade Ukraine. 
This body right now should be talk-
ing about the crisis in Ukraine and 
about how to counter Putin’s aggres-
sion and expansionism. The best way to 
do so would be to immediately put 
sanctions on Nord Stream 2—sanctions 
that we had in place; bipartisan sanc-
tions that I authored, that both of the 
Senators from Delaware supported, and 
that, indeed, had overwhelming bipar-
tisan support from both Houses of Con-
gress, passed into law, and worked. 
Now, I have sought to ensure that we 
have the time, space, and resources to 
address how we stop Putin from invad-
ing Ukraine, and, indeed, I have offered 
a deal to resolve this impasse. It is a 
deal that I have offered to Senator 
SCHUMER that I would lift the hold on 
a number of nominees in exchange for 
a vote on sanctions on Nord Stream 2. 
I would note that this is a deal Sen-
ator SCHUMER accepted 3 weeks ago. 
Three weeks ago, when we were debat-
ing the National Defense Authorization 
Act, I likewise sought a vote on sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2. In exchange 
for that vote, I offered to lift the hold 
on seven nominees. Senator SCHUMER 
accepted that deal, and the vote was 
scheduled. Then, unfortunately, the en-
tire package of amendment votes that 
had been agreed to on Nord Stream 2 
fell down in an unrelated dispute over 
other matters. 
This week, I have offered Senator 
SCHUMER a similar deal, although a 
substantially more generous deal. The 
deal that Senator SCHUMER had accept-
ed was to lift seven holds in exchange 
for a vote. He said yes to this. 
I have now put on the table a deal to 
lift 16 holds in exchange for a vote on 
Nord Stream 2 sanctions—more than 
twice as many holds. Included among 
those 16 is Governor Markell from 
Delaware. He is among the holds I have 
agreed to lift if Senator SCHUMER will 
agree to schedule the vote that 3 weeks 
ago he agreed to schedule. 
At this point, this deal is a better 
deal on every metric than the deal 
SCHUMER already said yes too. Unfortu-
nately, as we stand right now, he has 
not yet said yes to this better deal. 
So at this point, I am going to 
counter with a request for unanimous 
consent that we impose sanctions on 
Nord Stream 2, and I expect my Demo-
cratic colleagues will oppose this. 
But as if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Banking 
Committee be discharged from further 
consideration of S. 3322 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. I further ask that the bill be 
considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, I ob-
ject to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, reserv-
ing the right to object, I would note, as 
I did again, that there is a prospect for 
a reasonable compromise, and it is a 
compromise that Senator COONS has 
been integral in working to seek a res-
olution, and I thank him for his posi-
tive and productive efforts trying to 
bring the two sides together. 
You know, the two sides of the aisle 
often distrust each other. It is the na-
ture of a two-party system. But we 
have a path forward that can confirm a 
substantial number of nominees in 
these final 2 weeks of this year and can 
also schedule a vote on an issue that 
previous to this administration com-
manded virtual unanimous, bipartisan 
support. 
Among those who would be cleared is 
Governor Markell, and so I would en-
courage my friends from Delaware, 
given the eloquence with which you ad-
vocated his confirmation, I would sug-
gest you direct that eloquence to your 
own party’s leader, who has the ability 
to accept this deal and see Governor 
Markell confirmed to the new position 
to which he has been nominated this 
week. But since that deal has not yet 
been accepted, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Madam President, if I 
might, just in concluding this par-
ticular exchange, several things are 
also important to make clear. 
First, I think every Member of this 
Congress is concerned about the secu-
rity, the independence, the safety of 
Ukraine and about aggressive actions 
by Putin’s Russia. 
Second, earlier today, the chairman 
of the Foreign Relations Committee 
and the Senate majority leader urged 
that all holds on ambassadorial nomi-
nees be waived. In the interest of 
America’s security, our place in the 
world, our ability to do the job that we 
have to do here in this body of advo-
cating for and representing the inter-
ests of the United States by confirming 
qualified 
and 
competent 
nominees, 
they have urged that every hold be lift-
ed. That is the current position of the 
chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee and the majority leader. 
Hearing the objection of my col-
league from Texas, I understand there 
is a significant gap. I commit to work-
ing to trying to resolve this in a re-
sponsible way, but, in my view, the 
right lies on the side of those who are 
saying we should not have holds on 
Ambassadors. 
I also agree that there should be con-
sideration of the issue of whether or 
not sanctions appropriately should be 
imposed on the Nord Stream pipeline 
going forward. 
It is my hope that, working together 
and listening to each other, we can yet 
find a way forward. 
One last comment and concern: At 
the end of this calendar year, every 
nominee will return to the White 
House and need to be renominated. It is 
my hope that we will also come to an 
understanding that every nominee for 
an ambassadorship who has already 
been heard by the Foreign Relations 
Committee and advanced to this floor 
will not be returned and there be a re-
quirement that they be reheard in 
front of our committee. 
We can find a fast path forward. I 
dedicate myself to finding it and work-
ing with any colleague interested in 
working with me to close this gap in 
the days that remain. 
With that, Madam President, I would 
like to thank you and my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
our Nation’s economy. 
We have come to the end of another 
calendar year. The American people 
are asking themselves a simple ques-
tion: Are we better off now, today, than 
we were 1 year ago? 
For most Americans, the answer is 
no. In fact, a new survey from the New 
York Federal Reserve says just that. 
Most of the people surveyed say they 
are worse off now than they were 1 year 
ago. 
Most also said, very concerning, that 
they expect to be worse off a year from 
now than they are today, and it is easy 
to see why. Shelves are empty, we have 
the worst labor shortage ever recorded, 
and prices are rising at the fastest rate 
in 40 years. 
Joe Biden is breaking records, but 
not the good kind. Joe Biden is about 
to enter his second year in office with 
record-high inflation and record-low 
approval. 
Since Joe Biden took office, prices 
have gone up much faster than wages. 
As a result, the typical American fam-
ily can purchase less today than they 
could a year ago. People have had to 
change the way they drive, they shop, 
and they eat. 
By one estimate, families are paying 
$175 more every month because of infla-
tion since Joe Biden took office. This 
works out to be $2,000 a year—a bite 
out of the paychecks of the American 
people equivalent to a loss of $2,000. 
Now, some estimates are even higher.

top adviser to President Obama. His es-
timate is that it is double that number. 
He said there have been $4,000 more in 
expenses for the American families this 
year than there was last year. 
Of course, the biggest increase that 
we see is in energy. Gas prices are up. 
They are up by more than a dollar a 
gallon. Now, this is just in the 10 
months since Joe Biden took office. It 
costs $20 to $30 more to fill the tank. 
Today, they are at a 7-year high. 
Natural gas prices are also at a 7- 
year high, while half the families in 
America heat their homes with natural 
gas. One in five American families has 
already been cutting expenses in other 
places to pay for their energy bill for 
the year. 
Last month was the biggest jump in 
energy prices, amazingly, in an entire 
decade, and winter is almost here. 
Some people may have to choose be-
tween whether they can afford to eat 
or whether they can afford to heat 
their homes. 
It is hard to believe that in just 10 
full months in the White House, Joe 
Biden could have taken inflation to 
this very high level. 
The supply chain crisis, the worker 
shortage, the inflation crisis are all the 
direct results of the policies of the 
Biden administration and the Demo-
crats in Washington. 
Why are the shelves empty? Well, be-
cause we don’t have enough workers. 
More than 11 million jobs today are un-
filled. We have broken new records for 
unfilled jobs in 5 of the first 10 months 
that Joe Biden has been in office. And 
no matter where you go, there are 
‘‘help wanted’’ signs in the windows. 
This is no coincidence. In March, 
President Biden extended a bonus pay-
ment to people who stayed home from 
work. Millions of people made more 
money by not going to work than they 
would by going to work. Well, in Sep-
tember, that bonus payment ran out. 
Then Joe Biden announced a nation-
wide vaccine mandate on the American 
people. This mandate took a sledge 
hammer to our Nation’s workforce. 
The President must have known that 
people would lose their jobs. It seems 
he didn’t care because he imposed the 
mandate anyway. 
These are people who worked every 
day during the pandemic, showing up 
no matter the weather, no matter the 
situation. They showed up to do the job 
to help the people in their commu-
nities and in their States and in this 
country. 
Now, under Joe Biden, people are los-
ing their jobs, shelves are empty, 
prices continue to rise. 
In March, Democrats made things 
worse by putting $2 trillion on the Na-
tion’s credit card. That bill sent infla-
tion into overdrive. 
The San Francisco Federal Reserve 
says the Democrats’ spending increased 
inflation. 
Democrats 
made 
lavish 
promises 
about their last spending bill. They 
said the bill would create millions of 
jobs. NANCY PELOSI said 4 million jobs. 
Joe Biden upped the ante and said 7 
million new jobs. 
How did the predictions turn out? 
Not so well for the predictions of 
NANCY PELOSI or Joe Biden. Joe Biden 
was off by the full 7 million jobs. 
The most recent jobs report shows we 
created fewer jobs than were predicted 
even without the Democrats’ spending 
bill. Those 7 million jobs Joe promised 
are nowhere to be found. 
Last month, we created less than half 
the number of jobs the experts pre-
dicted. 
Now Democrats want to do the same 
thing all over again. They want an-
other 
multitrillion-dollar 
spending 
spree. This spending spree would cause 
the largest tax increase in half a cen-
tury, trillions more in debt, and even 
higher prices. 
Speaking of rising prices, the price of 
this spending bill keeps going up. For 
months, Democrats claimed that they 
wouldn’t add to the debt. Then they 
said the total bill would cost less than 
$2 trillion. 
Last Friday, we found out the real 
price tag. The Congressional Budget 
Office took all the accounting gim-
micks, the budgets tricks—took it all 
out of the bill—and they told us that 
the real cost of the bill is nearly triple 
the price that the Democrats said. 
The real pricetag is close to $5 tril-
lion. It would be the largest spending 
bill in history. The Democrats’ spend-
ing spree would add $3 trillion to the 
national debt. 
And, just yesterday, the Democrats 
voted—every Democrat voted—to raise 
the debt ceiling in the United States by 
$2.5 trillion. Every Republican voted 
against it. 
If you think about how much money 
this is, it is almost the size of the en-
tire economy of the United Kingdom. 
You know, all of this spending would 
bring the Democrats’ total to $5 tril-
lion in new debt in just 10 months. 
And what does all of this spending 
get you? 
Well, the most expensive thing in the 
bill is something that some refer to as 
the Green New Deal, which is billions 
of dollars in new taxes on America’s 
natural gas production. It includes an 
army of climate activists paid to pro-
test American energy projects. 
The second most expensive part of 
the bill is the blue State billionaire 
bailout. It is a tax break for people in 
high-tax States. I look at it as specifi-
cally California, Illinois, New York, 
and New Jersey. The vast majority of 
Americans would get no tax break at 
all. Almost all of that benefit would go 
to the wealthy. 
Don’t take my word for it. Here is 
what the Democrat chairman of the 
Budget Committee, the junior Senator 
from Vermont, had to say about it. 
He said: 
The last thing we should be doing is giving 
more tax breaks to the very rich. It sends a 
terrible, terrible message. 
But that is what the Democrats in 
the House under NANCY PELOSI passed 
and sent to the Senate for consider-
ation and passage. 
The junior Senator from Vermont, 
the chairman of the Budget Com-
mittee, also said: ‘‘The hypocrisy is too 
strong.’’ 
Well, the chairman is absolutely 
right. Even by the standards of Demo-
crats in Washington, this hypocrisy is 
too strong. 
If Democrats pass this bill, it will 
mean tax cuts for billionaires and tax 
audits for working families. It will 
mean higher taxes, more debt, higher 
prices, the highest inflation in 40 years, 
and it will go even higher. 
When the American people ask them-
selves, ‘‘Are we better off today than 
we were a year ago?’’ we know what 
the answer is going to be: a resounding 
no. If Democrats pass this bill, it will 
be no for years and years to come. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
(Ms. SMITH assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
see my colleague from Kentucky on the 
floor, and I want to take this oppor-
tunity to express to him and to Sen-
ator MCCONNELL my condolences for 
what the people of Kentucky have en-
dured with this catastrophic devasta-
tion. I know he has been a strong advo-
cate for his State, and I fully support a 
swift, strong Federal response to alle-
viating the suffering and assisting in 
rebuilding. In times of tragedy, our Na-
tion comes together to support all who 
are in this kind of need. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 5323 
Mr. President, I also express my 
strong support—and it is the reason I 
am here—for $1 billion of supplemental 
security assistance to replenish Israel’s 
Iron Dome Supplemental Appropria-
tions Act. The Senate must pass H.R. 
5323 as quickly as possible. The Iron 
Dome has widespread, bipartisan sup-
port in Congress—as well it should. It 
has 
the 
administration’s 
support, 
which it richly deserves. 
During the May 2021 conflict between 
Israel and Hamas, the Iron Dome de-
fense system intercepted about 90 per-
cent of the missiles that were targeting 
populated civilians in Israel. In total, 
4,400 rockets were launched by Hamas. 
If the Iron Dome had failed, countless 
Israeli 
civilians 
would 
have 
been 
killed. The system performed excep-
tionally well, and it showed its neces-
sity for both humanitarian and stra-
tegic defensive purposes. 
I am very concerned that one of my 
colleagues previously blocked the pas-
sage of this bill in the Senate. I hope 
provisions of this year’s Defense Au-
thorization Act, specifically sections

December 15, 2021 
1213 and 1214 and section 9021 of last 
year’s Defense appropriations bill, as-
suage 
any 
ongoing 
concern 
about 
transferring funds to the Taliban. No 
funds—none—zero—will be used to help 
or support or enable, in any way, the 
Taliban. Funds previously appropriated 
for the Afghanistan National Security 
Forces are deeply needed to terminate 
contracts that are already in place. 
These funds will not go to the Taliban 
but to those who supported the U.S. 
mission in Afghanistan. 
If any Pentagon employee breaks the 
law—if any one of them makes funds 
available to the Taliban—that indi-
vidual could and should face criminal 
penalties, including jail time under the 
Antideficiency Act. We cannot con-
tinue to use the U.S.-Israeli relation-
ship as a political football. It is against 
our own strategic interests; it violates 
our humanitarian values; and it is a se-
curity problem. 
I am a strong, strong supporter of 
Israel, but I often say that friends can 
disagree, and friends can criticize each 
other. I have been critical at times of 
my friends in the Israeli Government. I 
am standing again on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate, being, arguably, critical of 
one of my colleagues, and I ask: Where 
are my colleagues across the aisle 
when one of their own Members is ac-
tively impeding Israel’s ability to de-
fend itself from Hamas? It is a cause 
they say they support. Where is their 
concern? Where is the outrage? 
I urge all of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to support this crit-
ical funding. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
at a time to be determined by the ma-
jority leader, following consultation 
with the Republican leader, the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 140, H.R. 5323; that there be 
up to 2 hours of debate; and that upon 
the use or yielding back of time, the 
bill be considered read a third time, 
and the Senate vote on passage of the 
bill without intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, I have consistently 
opposed spending outside of the budget 
unless it is offset by spending cuts else-
where. It is not only an opinion I hold, 
it is actually the law. It is called pay 
as you go. 
We passed the law many years ago— 
more than a decade ago—to try to bal-
ance our books by having people come 
forward with things that sound good, 
want to spend it but not offset it by 
spending cuts elsewhere. 
There is no question that the United 
States has been a very good ally of 
Israel. Over time, probably funds ex-
ceeding $80 to $100 billion have been ex-
pended to Israel over the last four dec-
ades. Just on missile defense, the 
United States has given Israel $7 bil-
lion: $1.6 billion for Iron Dome, $2 bil-
lion for David’s Sling, and $3.7 billion 
for Arrow. In fact, the NDAA that just 
passed this week gives them another 
$100 million for this. 
I am not disputing whether or not 
the extra billion dollars would help 
them. I will vote for the extra billion 
dollars, and that is what I will propose 
today. But it should be offset with 
spending cuts elsewhere. 
There is a $3 billion fund that is left 
over from money we were giving to the 
Afghan national government. There is 
no Afghan national government. There 
is a bunch of hoodlums, the Taliban, 
who have taken over. 
I asked Secretary Blinken: Can you 
assure me you are not going to give 
these funds to the Taliban? 
He says: It depends on how they be-
have. 
So it isn’t so certain that this money 
is not going to go to the Taliban. The 
current law may say future money 
goes, but this old money, and we don’t 
want it going to the Taliban. We think 
it should be better spent. 
It is money that can be reclaimed. 
Why wouldn’t it be a good thing to 
take money that might go to our 
enemy and actually give it to our ally? 
It makes perfect sense. Why would we 
be so obstinate that we are unwilling 
to take a pay-for? It is a pay-for that is 
sitting there waiting for us to use. 
Three billion dollars is supposed to 
be given to the Afghan national gov-
ernment. It no longer exists. Let’s take 
a billion of that, let’s give it for Iron 
Dome; let’s give $2 billion back to the 
Treasury. It sounds like a win-win-win 
all around. 
Why can’t we, for once in our lives, 
spend money on something good and 
take away money from something 
where we shouldn’t be spending it? 
This money was never intended to go 
to anything but the Afghan national 
government. They don’t exist anymore. 
We should reclaim that money, spend a 
billion on the Iron Dome, and put $2 
billion back in the Treasury. It might 
be the first time in decades that we ac-
tually did something fiscally respon-
sible around here. But that is a prob-
lem. I don’t understand why we can’t 
do it. 
So I would—rather than just give an-
other billion dollars out of the Treas-
ury that actually makes us weaker, 
makes us more in debt, let’s offset it 
by taking money that is in a fund for 
an entity that no longer exists. 
So, Mr. President, I, therefore, ask 
the Senator to modify his request so 
that instead of his proposal, the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 140, H.R. 5323; 
further, that the only amendment in 
order be my substitute amendment, 
which is at the desk. I further ask that 
there be 2 hours of debate, equally di-
vided between the two leaders or their 
designees; and that upon the use or 
yielding back of that time, the Paul 
substitute amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; that the bill, 
as amended, be considered read a third 
time, and the Senate vote on passage of 
the bill, as amended, with no inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
Senator so modify his request? 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Reserving the 
right to object, Mr. President, my col-
league from Kentucky talks about 
money as though it were going to go to 
the Taliban, as if it were going to an 
entity that no longer exists. In fact, 
that money is necessary to terminate 
contracts, to fulfill obligations, not 
only under the contracts but to our al-
lies, the Afghan at-risk allies who 
sought to fulfill our mission. We have a 
moral imperative, and we have, argu-
ably, a legal obligation. 
That money is not just sitting there. 
It is not fungible. But put aside the 
merits of that argument, we have also 
a moral and strategic interest to our 
ally Israel to replenish its defenses at a 
time when it depends on our assistance 
to defend itself, to provide that Iron 
Dome that saves lives of innocent civil-
ians who otherwise would have per-
ished as a result of those 4,400 rockets 
launched by Hamas and possibly led to 
escalating contention and conflict in 
that region. 
So it is a win-win, in fact, for us to 
replenish the Iron Dome without condi-
tioning it in any way on other funds. 
Therefore, I will not modify my re-
quest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection to the modification is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, I think it is very important that 
the American people know and those 
who support Israel know that we can 
get this done today. We can get a bil-
lion dollars additional, in addition to 
the $100 million, in addition to the $7 
billion we have already given to Israel, 
in addition to the $80 to $100 billion we 
have given to them over the decades— 
we can do an extra billion today. All I 
am asking is that it is paid for. 
The objections coming from Demo-
crats is that they are unwilling to pay 
for the Iron Dome spending so, in re-
ality, the funding won’t happen today 
because of Democrat opposition to Iron 
Dome being paid for. It can happen 
right now. All you got to do is agree to 
take money from a defunct fund to a 
defunct entity. Three billion dollars is 
in a fund to an entity that no longer 
exists. The Afghan national govern-
ment no longer exists. This is such an 
easy pay-for. This one is dangling low 
fruit that we can pay for. You can get 
exactly what we want to do, that is a 
billion dollars extra, in addition to the 
money we already have given Israel for 
Iron Dome, but pay for it. That is a re-
sponsible way. So I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9188 
December 15, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, if 
I may just finish. 
We are here again. I will come back 
again to the floor to seek this Iron 
Dome money. 
Many of us are absolutely determined 
that the United States fulfill this 
moral, humanitarian, and foreign pol-
icy obligation. It is in our strategic in-
terest. 
This obligation is paid for; it is not 
debt; and it will incur no obligations 
that are unpaid for. So I regret that my 
colleague, again, has blocked this from 
proceeding. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARIA L. PAGAN 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in a few 
minutes, I will be putting forward a 
unanimous consent request asking the 
Senate to take up and approve a highly 
qualified and noncontroversial nomi-
nee. 
I will just take a couple of minutes 
to talk about Maria Pagan, nominated 
to be the next Deputy U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative in Geneva. There are a few 
key points to make about the nominee, 
as well as the critical role she will 
serve representing the United States at 
the World Trade Organization to get a 
better deal for American workers, 
farmers, and businesses. 
To start, Ms. Pagan isn’t new to 
high-pressure, 
high-profile 
negotia-
tions. She is currently deputy general 
counsel at the U.S. Trade Representa-
tive’s Office, the person called in when 
issues are particularly challenging. 
She has taken on these difficult issues 
during numerous trade agreement ne-
gotiations, including the U.S.-Mexico- 
Canada Agreement. She was in lock-
step with Members of Congress who 
pushed hard to guarantee that the 
commitments laid out in the USMCA 
were fully and quickly enforceable, a 
key priority for protecting American 
jobs. 
She has been a longtime public serv-
ant, spending 30 years in government. 
She has served both Republican and 
Democratic administrations at the De-
partment of Commerce and at USTR. 
She is an expert on a host of issues 
from trade in services to government 
procurement, and she has litigated sev-
eral disputes before the WTO. 
She is highly qualified. She is a 
nominee who brings the two sides of 
the Senate together. The Finance Com-
mittee vote on her nomination was 27 
to 1. 
I would just say, at this point in 
time, that is about as good as it gets. 
Colleagues, I have said before that it 
is crucial to get qualified people to the 
office representing the United States 
around the world. It is important to 
have these skilled individuals working 
on behalf of our workers, our busi-
nesses, and our interests. This nomina-
tion is particularly important to me. 
It is no secret that the World Trade 
Organization, which can be a valuable 
institution, is not today functioning as 
it needs to. The rules that underpin the 
WTO were crafted more than two dec-
ades ago. These 20th century rules have 
simply not kept up with 21st century 
technology. 
Meanwhile, the Chinese Government 
has learned to game the system. It does 
so routinely at the expense of hard- 
working American families. 
As a result, the process of leveling 
the playing field with trade rules based 
on fairness have been overtaken by the 
exploitation of loopholes and rip-offs. 
In many cases, that comes at the direct 
expense 
of 
American 
workers 
and 
American businesses. 
With her decades of experience, Ms. 
Pagan understands these challenges as 
well as anyone. From day one after her 
confirmation, she will hit the ground 
running to lead our allies in fighting 
back. 
For example, one area that I feel par-
ticularly strongly about is that new 
rules are desperately needed to deal 
with subsidized fisheries. Harmful sub-
sidies are allowing fleets to reach dis-
tant shores of less developed countries 
like Ecuador and Ghana. They are 
stripping the ocean of fish without re-
gard to species or regulations or basic 
decency. These highly subsidized, poor-
ly regulated fleets rely on abhorrent 
labor practices—including forced labor. 
Worst of all, their catch ends up in 
American supermarkets and on Amer-
ican tables. 
Oregon fishing families who trade in 
fairly and sustainably caught U.S. 
salmon, pollack, and other fish simply 
should not be asked to compete against 
that kind of horrendous cheating. 
Negotiations on this issue have been 
dragging on for over 20 years, and I can 
tell you, the 20 years have not im-
proved the situation for our oceans and 
for our families. 
The 
12th 
Ministerial 
Conference, 
which was delayed last week due to the 
new COVID variant, is another really 
important chance to get these negotia-
tions finally done. The outcome has to 
be strong. It can’t open, once again, 
harmful new loopholes. 
These meetings have been resched-
uled to the spring. The United States 
needs tough, smart leadership at the 
table. Ms. Pagan, with her years of ne-
gotiation, is just the closer, just the 
kind of person the United States needs. 
There are no shortages of other 
issues that Ms. Pagan will have to 
tackle at the World Trade Organiza-
tion, from institutional reform to dis-
pute settlement, to e-commerce. The 
United States needs a leader who can 
work with our allies to get it all done. 
She is the right woman for the job. 
Maria Pagan is a highly qualified, ex-
perienced nominee. She is a proven ne-
gotiator, a strong advocate for work-
ers, 
farmers, 
and 
businesses. 
She 
comes, as I have indicated, with strong, 
27-to-1, bipartisan support in the Sen-
ate Finance Committee. There is just 
no justification for any delay in mov-
ing this nomination forward. 
I will have more to say when I ask 
unanimous consent, briefly, in a bit. 
And, at this moment, I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO DR. FRANCIS COLLINS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is a 
curious thing about tipping points in 
the quest for progress. Very often, the 
events that cleave history into ‘‘be-
fore’’ and ‘‘after’’ can seem insignifi-
cant when they happen. That might 
have been true 29 years ago, when the 
National Institutes of Health named a 
42-year-old professor from the Univer-
sity of Michigan to direct one of NIH’s 
newest cutting-edge institutes. 
The professor’s name was Francis 
Collins. The New York Times’ account 
of his arrival ran 117 words. 
His mission at NIH was to lead what 
we called then the Human Genome 
Project, an international quest to dis-
cover the genetic blueprint for human 
life. It was the scientific equivalent of 
the search for the Holy Grail. There 
were just as many skeptics as believers 
in that undertaking. 
But less than 6 years later, in June 
2000, the first mapping of the human 
genome was complete. Overnight, that 
obscure 
professor 
from 
Michigan, 
Francis Collins, became one of the 
most famous scientists in the world. 
The decoding of the human genome 
was the achievement of a historic pub-
lic-private partnership between the 
NIH’s genome lab, headed by Dr. Col-
lins and a private firm—a rival turned 
partner—founded by the genetic pio-
neer, Craig Venter. It involved hun-
dreds of scientists from six nations. It 
remains one of the greatest advances in 
scientific knowledge in all of recorded 
history. 
In a White House ceremony announc-
ing the first sequencing of the human 
genome, Dr. Collins said he was hum-
bled and awed by the discovery. In his 
words: ‘‘We have caught the first 
glimpses of our instruction book, pre-
viously known only to God.’’ 
Cracking the genetic code of human 
life has revolutionized science and 
medicine. It continues to yield pro-
found medical discoveries all the time. 
That historic discovery could have 
been the capstone of any career in 
science, but for Francis Collins, there 
was an amazing second act to follow. 
In 
2009, 
President 
Obama 
chose 
Francis Collins to lead the entire Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the largest

biomedical research agency in the 
world. In that capacity, Dr. Collins 
routinely works 100-hour weeks, over-
sees 18,000 Federal employees spread 
across 27 Institutes and Centers in 75 
buildings—mainly in Bethesda, MD, 
but also in Baltimore, North Carolina, 
Arizona, and Montana. 
Those numbers only quantify the 
NIH infrastructure. Their actual work 
is even more impressive. In fiscal year 
2020, the NIH awarded more than 50,000 
grants to more than 300,000 researchers 
working in universities and labora-
tories outside the NIH—in Illinois, in 
Minnesota, in Colorado, and virtually 
every State in the Nation. 
At the end of this month, after 12 
years, Francis Collins is stepping down 
as NIH Director. Thankfully, he is not 
stepping away from science. In a signa-
ture Collins move, the doctor is going 
back to his research roots, back to 
head a laboratory at the NIH’s Human 
Genome Institute, where he hopes to 
find treatments and cures for cystic fi-
brosis, diabetes, and other devastating 
illnesses. 
He has led NIH for 12 years under 
three Presidents, Democrat and Repub-
lican, making him the longest tenured 
head of the Agency since Presidents 
began selecting NIH heads 50 years ago. 
What distinguishes Francis Collins’ 
tenure as NIH Director, however, is not 
its length but his extraordinary ambi-
tion and record of achievement. My 
friend former Senator Barbara Mikul-
ski, who chaired once the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee, famously said 
that the initials NIH should stand for 
the ‘‘National Institutes of Hope.’’ 
As NIH Director, Francis Collins has 
worked tirelessly to live up to that 
ideal. 
As the Washington Post wrote, ‘‘He 
brought together scientists across dis-
ciplines and championed the hunt for 
biomedical advances in troves of data. 
He gave meaning to the promise of big 
science.’’ 
He embraced ambitious projects such 
as the BRAIN Initiative, a collabo-
rative effort to map the most complex 
organism on Earth, the human brain. It 
engaged 
engineers 
who 
had 
never 
worked on life sciences before, and it 
just might help unlock the mysteries 
of ALS, Alzheimer’s, and other diseases 
of the brain. 
He launched the Cancer Moonshot 
with then-Vice President Joe Biden 
and played an integral role in helping 
to make now-President Joe Biden’s 
dream 
of 
an 
Advanced 
Research 
Projects Agency for Health a reality. 
He created the ‘‘All of Us’’ Research 
Program, an effort to collect data 
about the genomic basis of disease 
from 1 million volunteers to advance 
our knowledge on how to cure it. 
He has been equally passionate about 
supporting the work of young sci-
entists, including women and scientists 
of color. The absence of women re-
searchers used to jokingly be referred 
to on research panels as ‘‘manels.’’ In 
2017, Francis Collins said that he would 
no longer speak at any conference in 
which women researchers were not fea-
tured. 
He made it a priority to minority sci-
entists and to make sure NIH-funded 
research addressed the health needs 
and historic concerns of communities 
of color. 
Nearly 7 years ago, I asked Dr. Col-
lins: ‘‘What does NIH need from Con-
gress to continue to achieve break-
throughs you envision?’’ 
At that point, the NIH had seen flat 
funding for several years. Inflation had 
eroded the number of research ideas 
they could support, and many young 
researchers were really questioning 
whether they had any future at the In-
stitution. 
Dr. Collins said simply: ‘‘If you can 
provide steady, predictable increases to 
our budget of 5 percent real growth 
each year, we can light up the score-
board.’’ 
I thought that sounded like a worthy 
goal so I enlisted my Senate friends 
ROY BLUNT of Missouri, PATTY MURRAY 
of Washington, and Lamar Alexander 
of Tennessee as partners. Senator 
LINDSEY GRAHAM and I came together 
and formed the bipartisan Senate NIH 
Caucus. 
With the determined leadership of 
Francis Collins and support of Senators 
from both sides of the aisle—listen to 
this—we have been able to increase 
funding for NIH by more than 40 per-
cent over the last 6 years. 
Some people say: Why should the 
taxpayers be paying for this research? 
Why not leave it to the free market; 
they make the money out of it. 
The answer is: The NIH funds the 
kinds of basic science that costs too 
much and takes too long for private 
companies driven by need for quarterly 
profits. 
One timely example: Years ago, a 
Hungarian-born American biochemist 
named Katalin Kariko had a hunch 
that messenger RNA—mRNA—could be 
used to instruct cells to make their 
own medicines or vaccines. The NIH 
funded this early research of this im-
migrant superstar when nobody else 
would. Last year, that research became 
the 
backbone 
of 
the 
Pfizer 
and 
Moderna COVID vaccines. 
One year ago yesterday, the first vac-
cine was administered, and more than 
450 million shots have followed in 
America since then. The majority were 
mRNA vaccines. 
According to a new study released by 
the Commonwealth Fund, the Amer-
ican vaccination program prevented 1.1 
million COVID deaths and prevented 
10.3 million COVID hospitalizations 
last year. Vaccines save lives, and NIH 
taxpayer-funded research made these 
vaccines possible. 
There are millions of people who 
have never heard of Francis Collins, 
but they are alive and healthy today 
because of the Human Genome Project 
and his ambitious agenda at NIH as 
well as the talented scientists he nur-
tured. 
He is an American treasure, one of 
the most important scientists of our 
time. As Dr. Collins prepares to end his 
historic tenure as NIH Director and re-
turn to his lab, I want to thank him for 
his tireless work, his good humor, his 
good advice, and great friendship. 
I also want to thank his family, espe-
cially his wife Diane Baker, a genetic 
counselor herself, who volunteers at 
the NIH Children’s Inn, where families 
stay while their sick kids are partici-
pating in clinical trials. 
And thanks to the thousands and 
thousands of dedicated researchers who 
have worked with Dr. Collins to realize 
his noble ambitions. 
Dr. Francis Collins, America is a bet-
ter place thanks to your singular con-
tribution to spare suffering and to cure 
the illnesses we face. I wish you many 
more happy years of discovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). The Senator from Utah. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. LEE. If confirmed as Deputy U.S. 
Trade Representative, Maria Pagan 
would be responsible for negotiating 
details of any waiver of the Trade-Re-
lated Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights agreement, also known as the 
TRIPS Agreement. 
I have concerns with Ms. Pagan’s 
nomination. Therefore, I intend to ob-
ject to that until the Biden administra-
tion has given me some basic commit-
ments regarding the administration’s 
position on waiving the TRIPS Agree-
ment, particularly related to some of 
the proposals being pushed by various 
countries. 
As a quick recap, the TRIPS Agree-
ment represents a vital element of 
international trade law protecting the 
intellectual property rights of U.S. 
businesses, 
individuals, 
and 
entre-
preneurs. Waiving the protection of 
these rights for COVID–19 drugs, vac-
cines, and treatments under the notion 
of some sense of international altruism 
will not advance a universal solution 
to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Instead, any proposal to waive IP 
protections would create a disincentive 
for continued research, development, 
and distribution of the COVID–19 treat-
ments or drugs. That could mean fewer 
healthcare options and advancements 
as the virus continues to mutate into 
new variants with degrees of resistance 
to existing remedies. 
As always, anytime you weaken one 
property right, it spills over into other 
areas. We wouldn’t expect this to be-
come contained to the COVID–19 uni-
verse. 
Additionally, U.S. companies would 
be less likely to introduce their prod-
uct to WTO-member countries not en-
forcing IP protections. That could 
mean fewer options and less access for 
our neighbors, not more. 
Intellectual property rights provide 
the grounds for businesses to take 
risks in turning novel ideas into con-
crete goods and services. A business

that knows its property is secure and 
will not be surreptitiously confiscated 
by government action can fully engage 
in developing the innovation that 
drives markets. 
Today, in stating my objections, this 
is all I am asking for. I have no con-
cerns with this individual in par-
ticular; rather, with the authority that 
she might wield and the assurances I 
am wanting to receive from the admin-
istration on that authority, some as-
surance that this administration will 
not unilaterally wipe out intellectual 
property protections that have resulted 
in the vast majority of COVID–19 rem-
edies the U.S. currently enjoys and 
have also served millions of others 
globally. These are the things that are 
on the table. All I want is some assur-
ance from the administration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent, notwithstanding 
rule XXII, if applicable, at a time to be 
determined by the majority leader in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, that the Senate proceed to execu-
tive session to consider Executive Cal-
endar No. 547, Maria L. Pagan, of Puer-
to Rico, to be a Deputy United States 
Trade Representative (Geneva Office), 
with the rank of Ambassador; that 
there be 10 minutes of debate, equally 
divided in the usual form on the nomi-
nation; that upon the use or yielding 
back of time, the Senate proceed to 
vote without intervening action or de-
bate on the nomination; that if the 
nomination is confirmed, the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with to intervening ac-
tion or debate; that no further motions 
be in order to the nomination; that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action and the Senate 
then resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LEE. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, there 
has been an objection. Let me be very 
brief. We have a lot to do still tonight. 
As the new COVID variant surges 
around the globe and threatens Ameri-
cans here at home and millions around 
the world, the United States needs to 
do everything possible to get shots in 
arms, including having the right people 
in Geneva to find solutions to the 
availability and distribution of vac-
cines. 
COVID continues to be a deadly cri-
sis, and we should be working in every 
way possible to make sure that the 
Biden team has a group that can reach 
agreement on a TRIPS waiver and any 
other trade-based solutions. 
I look forward to continuing efforts 
to talk with my colleague from Utah. 
This is urgent business. We have to get 
it worked out. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. To reiterate here, all I 
want is some assurance. I appreciate 
my friend and colleague from Oregon 
understanding my basic concern here. 
It is not an unreasonable concern. All I 
want is some assurance from the ad-
ministration that it is not going to 
wipe out intellectual property protec-
tions. That wouldn’t be right. They 
know it is not right. They give me 
those assurances, we can move on. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—H.R. 6256 
Mr. RUBIO. I think this is an issue 
that has been talked about. There is a 
lot of interest in it and rightfully so. 
In China, even as I speak to you now, 
human beings working as slaves be-
cause of their ethnicity and their reli-
gion, Uighur Muslims, are in factories 
making products that people will buy 
this holiday season and throughout the 
year. 
I think it would be shocking to most 
Americans. I think it would be shock-
ing to all of us to know that even as I 
stand here now, there are products in 
this very Chamber in the Senate that 
were touched by and made by the 
hands of slaves. It is a horrifying, hor-
rifying human rights situation—fully 
sanctioned, as we now know, by the 
Government of China, the Communist 
Party of China. 
We know this, by the way. The New 
York Times had access to these docu-
ments for a long time—and they were 
finally revealed—that show that this 
plan to use slave labor went to the 
highest 
levels 
of 
that 
Communist 
Party. 
I think it is also appalling that it re-
veals the level of dependence this coun-
try has and the need we have to rebuild 
our industrial base in this country and 
in allied nations. It is appalling be-
cause it is a fact that we are so depend-
ent on China in our supply chain, that 
many have asked us to look the other 
way, to not complain about this, to not 
pass a bill about this because it would 
disrupt supply chains, when what they 
really mean is it would disrupt the bot-
tom line, their profits. 
I don’t need to explain to anybody 
how this works. You can make a lot of 
money if you don’t have to pay your 
workers or you pay them very little. It 
allows you to undercut your competi-
tion. 
So the fact that we have major 
American corporations and, for that 
matter, national corporations and mul-
tinational corporations that are mak-
ing money, whose profits are driven by 
the fact that slaves are building and 
making the materials they sell to us, is 
a horrifying reality. 
We have worked on this in a bipar-
tisan way for 2 years, and we have, for-
tunately, now reached a point—and, as 
you recall, I was here 2 weeks ago ob-
jecting to an amendment package on 
the NDAA to force action. I want to 
recognize Congressman MCGOVERN, our 
House counterpart, and, obviously, the 
junior Senator from Oregon, who is 
going to speak in a moment here in the 
Senate. It has been a bipartisan effort. 
We passed legislation on this last 
year. Differences between the House 
and Senate kept it from becoming law. 
We passed it unanimously out of the 
Senate earlier this year, but there were 
differences between our approaches. 
And since that time, where the amend-
ment packet was objected to on the De-
fense bill, the House has passed not one 
but two versions of this bill. 
We are now in possession of one of 
those two versions, and it is a version 
that doesn’t have any objections here 
in the Senate either. 
I wish we didn’t have to pass this 
bill. There have been some in the hall-
way who have suggested—I don’t know 
if the right word is congratulations, 
but commenting on how far we have 
come. And my argument is that this is 
nothing to be happy about because, 
even when we pass this bill, there will 
still be people working as slaves. 
I wish that this did not even exist, 
but it does, and we must address it. So 
we are now virtually just a couple of 
moves away, and it may not happen 
today, unfortunately, for reasons you 
are about to learn unrelated to this. 
But we are a couple of moves away 
from being able to send this to the 
White House for the President to sign 
and for it to become law. 
I think it would be a powerful state-
ment to make but also impactful. A 
bill that says if you make things—if 
you are a company that makes things 
or sources material—from these parts 
of China, you are going to have to 
prove that slaves didn’t make it before 
you can bring it into this country. And 
I hope that if we can do that here, that 
other countries around the world will 
follow suit. 
If I may, Madam President, I wanted 
to yield to the junior Senator from Or-
egon, who has worked side by side with 
us on this and has been a key part of 
this, to issue his comments on it as 
well. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I join with my col-
league from Florida, Senator RUBIO, in 
calling out genocide in China. It is a 
terrible term describing horrific acts in 
which humanity assaults humanity. 
Just 7 weeks from now—7 weeks from 
this Friday—there is going to be the 
opening ceremonies of the Olympic 
Games in China, and there is going to 
be fancy dances by minorities from 
across the country. And China will be 
saying to the world: See what a beau-
tiful country we have, with all this di-
versity, including people from Xinjiang 
Province, the Uighurs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9191 
December 15, 2021 
Behind those fancy performances in 
the opening ceremonies, there is a 
very, very ugly truth. That ugly truth 
is that the Chinese Government is com-
mitting genocide against the Uighur 
population. 
More 
than 
a 
million 
Uighurs are enslaved, and they are 
enslaved to produce products for the 
world for the profit of China. 
And I don’t think anyone in America 
wants us to be complicit in genocide by 
buying these products. That is what 
this bill is all about. 
It is to say: Companies, when you 
produce things in Xinjiang, make sure 
that the supply chain is investigated 
and is untainted by these horrific acts. 
This is bipartisan. This is bicameral. 
This is the best of the American spirit. 
And so I strongly, strongly support 
passage of this act. We passed it before. 
As my colleague just mentioned, we 
passed it unanimously. And now we 
have a version that has been worked 
out with the House version. It is ready 
to roll. 
So, colleagues, let’s get this done as 
a powerful statement of where America 
stands on human rights, a powerful 
statement that we are against geno-
cide, a powerful statement that, when 
it comes to these human rights prin-
ciples, we stand together—Democrat 
and Republican, House and Senate. 
I extend my appreciation to our col-
leagues in the House, Congressman 
SMITH and Congressman MCGOVERN. We 
all worked together on the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China. 
We held a series of hearings to under-
stand better not just the horrific acts 
that are occurring in Xinjiang but also 
horrific acts that are happening in 
Tibet and Hong Kong. But this bill fo-
cuses on the genocide against the 
Uighurs. Let’s get this done. It mat-
ters. Let’s act now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, as if 
in legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of H.R. 6256, 
which was received from the House; 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, first, let me 
thank the Senator from Florida and 
the Senator from Oregon for the really 
important work that they have done on 
the underlying legislation. 
It is of critical importance that this 
Senate stand together, Republicans 
and Democrats, against the ongoing 
genocide that is occurring in China 
today. 
And I will say that, despite all the 
news about division in this Chamber, 
the coming together around China poli-
cies, the coming together between par-
ties over the course of 2021 with respect 
to the threat that China presents to 
the United States and the global world 
order and the threat they present to 
human rights, both domestically and 
externally, I think, is important. 
I support the underlying legislation, 
but I also want to make sure that we 
have the personnel in place that can ef-
fectuate the policy. Good policy occurs 
when the Congress steps up and hands 
the executive branch a tool that they 
can use, but we need craftsmen who 
can effectuate that tool set. 
Pending on the calendar today, I 
would argue, are over a dozen nominees 
who would be in charge of imple-
menting policy in and around China: 
the Assistant Secretary for Inter-
national Organizations; the Assistant 
Secretary for Near East Affairs; the 
Assistant Secretary for Population, 
Refugees, and Migration; Ambassadors 
to Bangladesh, Brunei, Japan, Sri 
Lanka, Vietnam—all pending on the 
calendar today. 
But perhaps the three most impor-
tant nominees who will implement the 
policy that Senator RUBIO and Senator 
WYDEN are bringing forward today are 
these: first, the nominee to be the Am-
bassador to China, Nicholas Burns; the 
nominee to be Assistant Secretary of 
State for Economic and Business Af-
fairs, who would oversee this new pol-
icy, Ramin Toloui; and, lastly, the Am-
bassador at Large for International Re-
ligious Freedom, obviously critical to 
the plight of the Uighurs, Rashad 
Hussain. 
In particular, Ambassador Burns is 
uniquely qualified for this post, having 
been Ambassador to NATO and Ambas-
sador to Greece. At his hearing, he 
made clear how he would view the Chi-
nese behavior in Xinjiang Province. He 
said the PRC’s genocide, its abuse in 
Tibet, its smothering of Hong Kong’s 
autonomy and freedoms, and its bul-
lying of Taiwan are unjust and must 
stop. 
Having an ambassador in China in 
place, having an Assistant Secretary of 
State for Economic and Business Af-
fairs, and having an ambassador work-
ing every single day on international 
religious freedom, hand in hand with 
this new legislation, gives the tools 
and the legislative authority necessary 
to get the United States moving to-
ward the right side of human rights in 
China. 
So with that, I would ask the Senator 
from Florida to modify his request to 
include the following request. 
I would ask unanimous consent that, 
notwithstanding rule XXII, if applica-
ble, at a time to be determined by the 
majority leader, in consultation with 
the Republican leader, the Senate pro-
ceed to executive session to consider 
the following nominations: Executive 
Calendar No. 525, Nicholas Burns, of 
Massachusetts, to be Ambassador Ex-
traordinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; Calendar No. 
626, Ramin Toloui, of Iowa, to be an As-
sistant Secretary of State (Economic 
and Business Affairs); Calendar No. 619 
Rashad Hussain, of Virginia, to be Am-
bassador at Large for International Re-
ligious Freedom; that there be 10 min-
utes for debate, equally divided in the 
usual form on the nominations en bloc; 
that upon the use or yielding back of 
time, the Senate proceed to vote with-
out intervening action or debate on the 
nominations in the order listed; that if 
a nomination is confirmed, the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate; that no further mo-
tions be in order to the nominations; 
that the President be immediately no-
tified of the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Reserving the right to 
object, as modified, that would mean 
the passage of the Uighur slave labor 
measure, which has unanimous sup-
port, and would put us on the precipice 
and on track to confirm nominees— 
Ambassadors to China and important 
Secretary of State posts and also the 
Ambassador for International Reli-
gious Freedom—I would have no objec-
tion to that modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The re-
quest has been modified. 
Is there objection to the request as 
modified? 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, let 
me just say at the outset, I strongly, 
strongly, strongly agree with my col-
leagues—Senator RUBIO and my friend 
from Oregon Senator MERKLEY—that 
the United States has to fight genocide 
and the scourge of forced labor taking 
place in Western China and elsewhere 
around the world. 
As the chairman of the Senate Fi-
nance Committee, one of my special 
priorities—one that we worked on for 
quite some time—has been to tackle 
this issue of forced labor. It goes back 
to work that Senator BROWN and I did 
in 2015 to close an unjustifiable loop-
hole that allowed an exception to the 
ban on products made with forced 
labor. Not only is it morally abhorrent, 
it is also a major trade rip-off that un-
dermines American workers. 
On the Finance Committee, we be-
lieve that the Senate needs to look at 
every opportunity to protect good-pay-
ing American jobs and help workers 
and their families get ahead. That 
means that the Senate has got to be 
prepared to tackle multiple challenges 
at once. 
Right now, the urgent issue for so 
many American families is the poten-
tial expiration of child tax credit pay-
ments on January 1. Families received 
their sixth child tax credit payment 
today. It could be the last if this body 
does not act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9192 
December 15, 2021 
Families have come to depend on 
these payments to cover the essentials 
like rent, groceries, heat, and clothing 
for their kids. 
Just recently, I was home in Oregon, 
and I asked people what they spend the 
child tax credit on, and they said: 
‘‘Ron, we spend it on things like 
shoes.’’ 
And in our part of the world, it gets 
cold; it gets wet. We are not talking 
about luxury; we are talking about 
shoes for children. 
Food 
insecurity 
among 
families 
dropped by about 25 percent since these 
child tax credit payments began. Child 
poverty has been cut nearly in half. 
This program, in my view, is like So-
cial Security for kids and vulnerable 
families. We never let Social Security 
checks for vulnerable seniors lapse. 
For anybody who questions how valu-
able this program has been to Amer-
ican families, I want to just very brief-
ly touch on a few messages that we 
have gotten from parents in a cross- 
section of communities across the 
country about how the child tax credit 
has helped them: 
A parent in Kentucky: ‘‘It helped me 
with fuel for my car and provided me 
enough to buy my daughter a few 
things she needed.’’ 
A parent in New York: ‘‘It’s helped 
take the burden off our family. My hus-
band lost his job during COVID but 
since found another job, but the gap of 
the job loss was heavy.’’ 
A parent in Alabama: ‘‘I was able to 
buy my daughter her school clothes.’’ 
A parent in New Hampshire: ‘‘It has 
helped 
me 
tremendously 
especially 
when school was starting.’’ 
So the message from American par-
ents, from sea to shining sea, is the 
child tax credit has been vital to so 
many American families and lowering 
the cost of raising a family, ensuring 
they can provide that basic level of se-
curity all children deserve. 
So at this point, I would ask, would 
the Senator from Florida modify his 
request to include the adoption of my 
amendment that is at the desk to ex-
tend the child tax credit for 1 year and 
pass the bill as amended? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the further modification? 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Reserving the right to 
object, as I understand this further 
modification, it would say let’s take a 
bill that is meaningful on an important 
global issue, something—an important 
human rights issue that everyone here 
supports, that we can pass right now, 
today, and send it to the President and 
he can sign it tonight or tomorrow 
morning and it becomes law because 
everyone supports it, using this process 
we are using here, and in addition to 
that, set up votes on two nominees and 
an Assistant Secretary, at a time when 
speech after speech out here has been 
about how we are not getting to these 
nominees and Assistant Secretaries—so 
we can do all that but only if we add to 
it something that has bipartisan oppo-
sition; that, no matter what, at least 50 
people here are against. It cannot pass 
unanimously, and even if it could and 
it did pass, we would have to send it 
back over to the House, not to the 
President, and the House isn’t even in 
session until January 10. 
That doesn’t sound like a good ar-
rangement to me, and it is something 
that I would have to object to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I lis-
tened carefully to my colleague from 
Florida, and because of his objection, 
there isn’t going to be an opportunity 
for the Senate to take two bold steps 
tonight. 
I already indicated—made it very 
clear—that I am completely sympa-
thetic to my colleague from Florida, 
my colleague from Oregon, to the fight 
against genocide and forced labor. 
They got me at ‘‘hello’’ on their propo-
sition. 
I also feel incredibly strongly—in-
credibly strongly—about our vulner-
able children and our vulnerable fami-
lies who are going to be cut off from an 
essential lifeline unless the U.S. Sen-
ate acts. 
And, unfortunately, because of the 
objection from my colleague from Flor-
ida, we are not going to have a chance 
to take two bold steps tonight. That is 
what I am for. That is what I believe 
the American people are for. 
You bet we are against forced labor. 
You bet we are against genocide. But 
we also have had a long tradition of 
standing up for vulnerable kids, vulner-
able families, and tonight we could 
have obtained two bold objectives here 
in the U.S. Senate. 
I think it is unfortunate that my col-
league from Florida is unwilling to do 
that. Vulnerable families are going to 
be hurt as a result of the objection. I 
just want the Senate to know there 
was another way. There was another 
way we could have stood with the ef-
fort to deal with genocide and forced 
labor and protected families. They 
weren’t mutually exclusive. We could 
have done both. I think it is unfortu-
nate the Senate is not doing it. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
CHINESE POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, in 
1948, the world came together to adopt 
the United Nations Declaration of 
Human Rights to declare with one 
voice that every single person on Earth 
is ‘‘born free and equal in dignity and 
rights.’’ They declared that ‘‘no one 
shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, 
detention or exile’’; that ‘‘everyone has 
the right to freedom of thought’’ and 
everyone has a right to ‘‘freedom of 
opinion and expression.’’ 
This is Yu Wensheng, a human rights 
lawyer based in Beijing. His rights are 
being denied to him because he is arbi-
trarily detained after being arrested 
for exercising freedom of expression 
and freedom of opinion. 
Yu has a history of ruffling feathers 
in Beijing. He is known for criticizing 
the Communist Party, for supporting 
the ‘‘Yellow Umbrella’’ movement for 
rights in Hong Kong, and for taking on 
politically sensitive cases. Beijing has 
retaliated by destroying his legal ca-
reer and making it impossible for him 
to practice law. 
Yu Wensheng has been in Chinese 
custody since January of 2018 because 
he dared to publish an open letter call-
ing for political reforms, such as hold-
ing fair elections. 
The day after he published that let-
ter calling for fair elections, law en-
forcement officers, including police and 
armored vehicles, confronted him while 
he was walking his son to school and 
forced him into a police vehicle on sus-
picion of ‘‘picking quarrels and pro-
voking troubles.’’ Police had no regard 
for his son’s safety at that moment. 
Authorities later added the charge of 
‘‘inciting subversion,’’ a charge often 
used against human rights advocates 
and typically carrying a sentence of up 
to 5 years. 
Two years would go by before Yu was 
allowed to speak to his wife; 2 years be-
fore he was allowed to speak to his son; 
2 years before he was allowed to meet 
with his defense lawyers. During those 
2 years, he was secretly tried and con-
victed. In June of 2020, he was sen-
tenced to 4 years in prison—all without 
any defense lawyers present, without 
his family being even informed. 
He suffered greatly during this incar-
ceration. He was beaten up by a group 
of inmates and sustained injuries to his 
head. His right hand suffered nerve 
damage—damage that occurred in a 
previous detention—and is now shaking 
so violently, he can barely use it. He 
has had to learn to write with his left 
hand. 
His appeals have been denied. He was 
sent to serve his sentence in a prison 
600 miles away from Beijing despite re-
peated requests from his wife that he 
serve out his sentence closer to home 
so his family could visit. 
That type of action is the exact oppo-
site of the U.N. Declaration of Human 
Rights, that declaration that no one 
should be subjected to arbitrary arrest, 
detention, or exile. This man was sub-
jected to arbitrary arrest, detention, 
and exile simply for expressing the 
opinion that there should be fair elec-
tions. He is not alone. 
Today, I will also highlight a Chinese 
journalist. Her name is Haze Fan. She 
worked in Beijing for Bloomberg, cov-
ering global business issues. Before

December 15, 2021 
working with Bloomberg in 2017, she 
worked for other major international 
outlets, household names like Reuters, 
CNBC, CBS, and Al Jazeera. 
On December 7, 2020, just over a year 
ago, Ms. Fan was being escorted from 
her apartment by security officials. 
She was detained on suspicion of en-
dangering China’s national security, 
although a year later, the investiga-
tion into Ms. Fan is still ongoing, with 
no details of what she is accused of or 
even where she is held. She was a jour-
nalist, and a message is being sent. 
Certainly, this is not consistent with 
the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights 
that says that everyone has the right 
to freedom of thought and to freedom 
of opinion and expression because for 
being a journalist, she is being de-
tained. 
As I stand here at this moment, 127 
journalists like Haze Fan are detained 
in China, according to the statistics 
compiled by Reporters Without Bor-
ders. It is no wonder that China is at 
the very bottom of Reporters Without 
Borders’ World Press Freedom Index, 
right 
there 
with 
North 
Korea, 
Turkmenistan, and Eritrea. 
This is what is happening in a coun-
try that just 7 weeks from now will be 
hosting the Olympic Games—Games 
meant to be a celebration of camara-
derie, physical achievement, and lift-
ing up the human spirit. But it is Yu 
Wensheng and Haze Fan and all others 
like them detained by the Chinese Gov-
ernment for demanding the recognition 
that all are ‘‘born free and equal in dig-
nity and rights’’ who deserve to have 
their spirits lifted up. They deserve to 
know where the world stands. Does the 
world stand with them? 
Now, the United States and the 
United Kingdom, joined by Canada and 
joined by Australia—they have de-
clared diplomatic boycotts of Feb-
ruary’s Games. I am very proud that 
the Government of the United States 
has declared this boycott. They said 
that they will not join the fanfare of 
the Games, helping China to disguise 
the egregious human rights abuses 
against individuals like these; that we 
will not stand with our diplomats at 
those opening ceremonies when China 
has stripped the political rights of 
every single citizen in Hong Kong. We 
will not have our diplomats there in 
opening celebrations, helping China 
cover up its genocide against the 
Uighur people. But tonight, I am won-
dering where the rest of the free world 
is. 
You know, I was thinking a little bit 
about the history of France—the his-
tory of France being very engaged in 
human rights issues. France stood with 
the United States as an ally when we 
fought for our freedom. France gifted 
our Nation with the symbol of freedom, 
the Statue of Liberty, whose torch is 
held up to the world. France authored 
the Declaration of the Rights of Man 
and of the Citizen not in 1990 but in 
1789—one of the very first documents 
laying out the foundations of human 
rights, defining individual and collec-
tive rights. Where is France tonight— 
standing with the United States and 
Canada and Australia? They are not 
there. 
I am really disappointed to hear 
President Macron saying that any such 
boycott would be ‘‘insignificant.’’ Do 
you know what is significant? Going to 
the opening celebrations and helping 
China cover up genocide and stripping 
Hong Kong of political rights. It is not 
just significant and substantial, it is 
wrong. 
France, we call on you to continue 
the tradition of fighting for freedom, 
the tradition that led you to stand 
with us, that led you to send us the 
Statue of Liberty, that led you to craft 
one of the first documents in the world 
for human rights in 1789. 
The Education Minister of France ar-
gued that sport should be separate 
from political interference. When you 
put the Games in a nation engaged in 
genocide, you put the athletes in the 
middle of the worst of world horrors 
and ask them to be complicit in cov-
ering up by engaging in the Games as if 
nothing else was going on. 
You know, it was 1936 that the Olym-
pic Games were held in Hitler’s Ger-
many. He was already engaged in seri-
ous human rights violations. He turned 
down 
those 
violations 
during 
the 
Games, and the world said: Germany is 
coming back into the family of na-
tions. We did not as a world highlight 
his ongoing crimes at that time, which 
emboldened him to horrific acts that 
followed soon upon the close of those 
Games. That was a mistake, to help 
Hitler cover up the human rights 
abuses of the Nazis, and it is a mistake 
for us now to help China cover up its 
horrific human rights abuses. 
So I call on France to join us in this 
boycott, this diplomatic boycott, to 
say: Yes, it is too late for the Games to 
move. I regret that. I called on them to 
be moved. But it is not too late to strip 
away the pomp and circumstance of 
the opening Games. It is not too late to 
call out the serious, egregious conduct 
occurring in China—not some petty se-
rious problem but genocide and the 
crushing of the entire state of Hong 
Kong, the entire entity of Hong Kong, 
in terms of their political rights. 
France, join us, as you have over 
time, in standing for human rights.

ator from Texas. 
DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE AGENDA 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as 
the Senate’s schedule for this calendar 
year begins to wind down, hopefully 
with the anticipation of spending time 
with our friends and families during 
this holiday season, I want to look 
back over some of the deadlines that 
the majority leader, the Senator from 
New York, has set for Senate action 
and to ask whether these sort of arbi-
trary deadlines and attempts to do leg-
islation essentially along party lines is 
the right way to actually get things 
done in the Senate. 
We have excellent examples of how to 
get things done. Today, we passed the 
Defense 
authorization 
bill 
with 
a 
strong bipartisan vote. But we know 
that when either political party de-
cides to do things unilaterally, espe-
cially in a 50–50 Senate, it makes the 
work immeasurably harder, and that is 
for a good reason. 
The Founders of this country and our 
Constitution and the creators of this 
Senate looked to the Senate to be a de-
liberative body and looked for us to do 
what sometimes doesn’t come natu-
rally, which is to work together to 
build consensus. But, as I said, when 
one party or the other attempts to do 
things unilaterally, it usually means 
what you see here, which is one blown 
self-imposed deadline after another. 
First of all, the majority leader set a 
July 21 target for Senate action on a 
budget resolution. 
He laid out an August deadline for a 
partisan election takeover bill, which 
would have preempted State and local 
laws, which are responsible, under our 
division of responsibility in the Con-
stitution, under our Federal system, 
for conducting elections. 
Then he proudly announced his goal 
to get two bills to President Biden’s 
desk by the end of October. He said 
those would be joined together—a bi-
partisan infrastructure bill that is the 
exception to the rule—actually like the 
Defense authorization bill that actu-
ally enjoyed broad bipartisan support— 
but the hangup was the other part of 
that proposition, which was the Demo-
crats’ 
multitrillion-dollar 
partisan 
spending bill. 
Of course, not one single one of these 
deadlines was met—again, because it is 
hard to do things in a 50–50 Senate 
when you try to do it unilaterally 
without doing the hard work of build-
ing consensus, which is the way the 
Founders wanted this institution to 
work. 
So our colleague from New York kept 
setting deadlines and blowing right 
past them, and it looks like he is about 
to add another one to the list. Senator 
SCHUMER’s 
latest 
deadline 
for 
the 
‘‘Build Back Bankrupt’’ bill is Decem-
ber 25. That is Christmas. While he has 
yet to make an official announcement, 
news reports are starting to confirm 
what we have known all along—that 
the Senate will not vote on this bill by 
Christmas because it is just not ready 
for prime time. 
Before our colleagues can bend the 
rules of the Senate to pass their par-
tisan, 
multitrillion-dollar 
spending 
bill, they have got a lot of roadblocks 
to overcome. The most obvious is they 
need a bill to vote on. This bill is not 
even in final form yet. As a matter of 
fact, the Senate Finance Committee, 
on which I have the pleasure of serving, 
released about 1,100 pages of new text 
on Saturday, and there are at least 20 
different issues that have been raised 
with the Parliamentarian which need 
to be litigated in a deliberative proc-
ess, but the version of the legislation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9194 
December 15, 2021 
that passed the House started getting 
picked apart even before reaching this 
side of the Capitol. The committee 
chairmen 
here 
were 
still 
deciding 
which provisions to keep, which ones 
to alter, and which ones to throw away. 
It is tough to know how things are 
progressing because all of these con-
versations happen not here on the Sen-
ate floor, with open debate, but behind 
closed doors, completely out of view of 
the American people. That is dan-
gerous because this bill will touch vir-
tually every aspect of Americans’ daily 
lives and stick them with a massive in-
voice—without any visibility into the 
process. 
We are told that the Build Back Bet-
ter bill is immensely popular. Well, 
that may be true until you start look-
ing at the details, at the fine print. 
Right now, we have to rely on vague 
statements from our Democratic col-
leagues to understand where things 
stand, and I will tell you, right now, it 
doesn’t sound too promising. 
Following severe blowback from the 
American people after the details of 
this bill began to become public, Fi-
nance Committee Democrats began 
making changes to one extremely con-
troversial part of the bill. The Wash-
ington Post headline says it all: ‘‘The 
second-biggest program in the Demo-
crats’ spending plan gives billions to 
the rich.’’ 
No wonder they went back to the 
drawing board. After all, there is a 
sharp contrast from how our colleagues 
have tried to sell this bill—really, an 
effort of false advertising. They have 
harped previously—or some sections of 
the Democratic caucus—on the need to 
stick it to the rich, to tax the rich, but 
when given the opportunity, they hand 
out massive tax breaks for the rich. 
It is unclear how long it will take our 
colleagues to finalize changes to the 
millionaires’ tax breaks and the count-
less other provisions that are being re-
tooled, but once they lay down their 
pens, the work is not done. As I sug-
gested, they have the substantial and 
difficult process of vetting a number of 
the provisions with the Senate Parlia-
mentarian to determine whether these 
provisions can pass the Byrd rule. 
The Byrd rule is simply the name 
given to the process to see whether it 
complies with the 1974 Budget Act, 
which provides for an expedited process 
and 51 votes for passage because it is 
limited strictly to budgetary matters. 
When our colleagues try to stick into 
the bill other substantive law changes 
which require a 60-vote requirement, 
that is where the Byrd rule comes in, 
and that is where these provisions get 
kicked out. 
According to the chairman of the Fi-
nance Committee, the Finance Com-
mittee’s proposal alone has more than 
20 different issues to resolve with the 
Parliamentarian in the so-called Byrd 
bath, and that is just one committee. 
Our colleagues on various other com-
mittees are presenting arguments on 
provisions of all sizes. We have heard 
that our Democratic colleagues are 
trying to make massive changes in our 
immigration law on a party-line vote 
at 51 votes—50 votes plus the Vice 
President. Well, that has not succeeded 
on two previous occasions for good rea-
son, and now we are awaiting the ver-
dict of the Parliamentarian on those 
immigration proposals on the third 
try. 
But we know that this massive legis-
lation, once it is written, presumably, 
will go from everything from technical 
changes to major issues like whether 
the budget rule can be used to legalize 
millions of undocumented immigrants. 
Again, these conversations are hap-
pening not out here in the Senate, with 
an opportunity for full debate and 
amendment; they are happening behind 
closed doors. So we really don’t have a 
good sense—nor do the American peo-
ple—of what has been decided or how 
long it will take to resolve pending dis-
putes. 
If our Democratic colleagues receive 
adverse guidance from the Parliamen-
tarian, it is still unclear whether they 
will accept the outcome or light the 
rule book on fire, as some have sug-
gested, and try to overrule her. It is 
tough to imagine a world in which our 
Democrat colleagues would put this 
Frankenstein’s monster on the Senate 
floor before Christmas. Christmas is, in 
fact, 10 days away. Even if our col-
leagues were able to iron out every 
issue with the Parliamentarian and 
were able to present finalized text and 
receive a score on the final legislation 
at that time, Senator SCHUMER doesn’t 
have the votes to pass it. Again, we are 
an evenly divided Senate, with the Vice 
President 
casting 
the 
tie-breaking 
vote. 
Colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle are not on board entirely with 
this proposed massive spending-and-tax 
bill. Unlike the majority of our col-
leagues who have blindly fallen in line 
or aired their concerns in private, we 
know that the Senator from West Vir-
ginia, Mr. MANCHIN, has consistently 
expressed his reservations about the 
bill. 
In September, for example, he wrote 
an op-ed, titled: ‘‘Why I Won’t Support 
Spending Another $3.5 Trillion.’’ He 
has hardly been quiet or hidden his 
concerns. He shared his concerns in 
that op-ed about the scale and scope of 
this legislation, and he encouraged his 
colleagues in his own political party to 
take a strategic pause. 
Some of the reasons he cited included 
the growing threat of inflation, which 
has only increased since September. In-
flation, in fact, has now reached a 40- 
year high—just last month. He warned 
about the possibility that the virus 
might mutate and take a new turn and 
that we ought to really save our pow-
der in case we had to address either the 
public 
health 
or 
economic 
con-
sequences flowing from a new variant. 
Well, today, all of our eyes are on the 
Omicron variant, and we have yet to 
know how that will play out. He asked 
how we could respond to another finan-
cial crisis like we experienced in 2008 
during the great recession or, heaven 
forbid, a terrorist attack or a major 
international conflict. 
If we spend trillions of dollars on un-
necessary programs today, we will 
hardly have those reserves available to 
us should we need them. I think the 
questions and issues raised by the Sen-
ator from West Virginia were valid 
then, and they are even more pressing 
now. 
Over the last several months, the 
winds haven’t shifted in favor of this 
massive tax-and-spending bill. In fact, 
we now have more reason to believe 
this legislation would add to, not solve, 
the problems that the American people 
are facing. The Senator from West Vir-
ginia told one of our Republican col-
leagues that the score proposed by his 
own political party—$1.75 trillion—is 
full of gimmicks, and he even acknowl-
edged that that pricetag is a form of 
deceptive advertising. 
We now have an honest score, one 
that acknowledges that massive pro-
grams cannot be started and stopped 
on a dime and that, if you are really 
going to be honest about the cost of 
the bill, you need to look at a score 
that spans the full 10-year budget win-
dow. We now have that score, one that 
avoids the gimmicks that are meant to 
disguise the true cost of the bill. Now 
we can quantify how disingenuous this 
so-called $1.75 trillion pricetag really 
is, and it is about as disingenuous as 
the President’s claim that the bill 
costs zero. Nobody believes that. It 
really 
undermines 
the 
President’s 
credibility when he says something 
like that. 
The Congressional Budget Office now 
says this legislation, if in place for a 
full 10 years, would cost $4.9 trillion. 
That is on top of the almost $2 trillion 
our colleagues spent unilaterally ear-
lier this year. Well, that is certainly 
higher than the $3.5 trillion redline 
that Senator MANCHIN drew earlier this 
year, and it is a whole lot more than 
the $1.75 trillion pricetag that our 
Democratic colleagues are claiming. It 
makes the repeated claim that this bill 
costs zero seem even more bizarre and 
out of touch. 
Under this bill, as it is shaping up, 
we know deficits would increase by a 
staggering $3 trillion over the next dec-
ade. Now, last year, when we passed 
COVID–19 relief bills with huge bipar-
tisan majorities, we did so because it 
was a public health emergency and an 
economic emergency, and we did it to-
gether. Yet, on top of all of that nec-
essary spending, our colleagues are in-
sisting on spending another $4.9 tril-
lion—adding another $3 trillion to the 
debt over the next decade. Our children 
and grandchildren would never have a 
chance to dig out of the hole that our 
Democratic colleagues are now drill-
ing. 
This legislation doesn’t just fall 
short of solving problems; it actually 
makes them worse. This bill would fuel

the red-hot inflation that is already 
burning up the paychecks of the Amer-
ican people. People who are on fixed in-
comes are finding their purchasing 
power shrinking by the day because of 
the threat of inflation. We know this 
bill would also hurt our energy secu-
rity. It would give massive tax breaks 
to the wealthy while increasing taxes 
on the middle class. It would literally 
cut funding for safety net hospitals and 
drive the national debt to unimagi-
nable heights. Finally, and maybe most 
importantly, it would hand to the Fed-
eral Government decisions that should 
be made by families. 
I hope our colleague from West Vir-
ginia will continue to hold strong 
against the dangers of this bill. At a 
minimum, we need to tap the brakes 
and take what he called a ‘‘strategic 
pause.’’ 
So it seems the Democratic leader is 
on track to miss yet another deadline. 
For the country’s sake, I hope this bill 
does not arrive after Christmas. I hope 
it never comes at all. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate my friend from Texas and his 
comments, but I have trouble following 
some of them. 
When he came to the floor after the 
deserved credit for the Trump 2017–2018 
tax cut for the rich—70 percent of the 
benefits went to the 1 percent—he did 
take credit for his work in the Finance 
Committee. He should take credit for 
that, but that is what drove this hole 
in the deficit where the rich got richer. 
I remember during that—and the 
Presiding Officer was not here at the 
time, but he can still see it here. 
You can look out the window, and 
you can see Senator MCCONNELL’s of-
fice there and the lobbyists lined up. 
You should have seen it back when 
Senator CORNYN was talking about this 
tax cut—this tax cut for the rich— 
when they made these promises: You 
know, if you give tax cuts to really 
rich people and corporations, it will 
trickle down, and we will all do better. 
They will hire more people, and they 
will raise wages. 
Well, we know what they did. In fact, 
they just announced another round of 
it—a whole bunch of stock buybacks 
for the executives. So we know what 
happened during those years. Profits 
went up for corporations, and stock 
markets soared. Executive compensa-
tion exploded through the roof, and 
wages for most people in Mansfield, 
GA, and Mansfield, OH, and Marietta, 
GA, and Marietta, OH, stayed flat. We 
know that. That is why Build Back 
Better makes sense. It begins to put 
money in people’s pockets. 
And what my friend from Texas—and 
we sit across from each other in the Fi-
nance Committee and work together on 
some issues, and I appreciate what he 
has done on some other bills. But what 
he didn’t explain is why every one of 
them opposes the child tax credit. On 
the child tax credit, we know a number 
of things. I have been working on this 
since 2013. It started with not a lot of 
support, but it built huge support by 
this year, early this year. Sitting at 
this desk, on March 6, I voted—as did 
the Presiding Officer from Georgia in 
the first really big vote he cast as a 
Member of the Senate, in the major-
ity—for the child tax credit. 
Two different times, every single Re-
publican voted no. Every single Demo-
crat voted yes. Do you know what that 
meant? It meant that starting in July, 
when we got it set up, 90 percent of the 
families in Georgia, 90 percent of the 
families in Ohio who have children 
under the age of 18 got at least a $3,000- 
a-year tax cut. 
Think about that. There are families 
who struggle with paying rent. Twen-
ty-five percent of renters in this coun-
try before the pandemic paid more 
than half their income in rent. Think 
of the pressure those families are under 
if, at the end of every month, they cob-
ble together $700 to pay their rent. 
They get a $3,000 tax cut. The family 
who is struggling to pay for diapers or 
childcare, 
especially—the 
cost 
of 
childcare has exploded. 
Whether it is Metro Atlanta or Metro 
Columbus, 
OH, 
or 
whether 
it 
is 
smalltown Milledgeville or smalltown 
Shelby, OH, families struggle with 
childcare, and this $300 a month per 
child—or $250, depending on the age of 
the children—makes a huge difference 
in those families. 
One father said: You know, for the 
first time, I have money now to buy 
my daughter fast-pitch softball equip-
ment. 
A mother said to me: I have money 
now. For the first time, I can send my 
son for a week to summer camp and 
buy school supplies in the fall. 
And, as I said, for diapers and other 
expenses for infants, it makes all the 
difference in the world. 
I expect the Presiding Officer, I hope, 
has a long career in this body. I don’t 
know if he will ever get the oppor-
tunity to vote on anything as big as 
what we did in March with the recov-
ery act and what we are about to do 
with Build Back Better. For me, they 
are the highlights of my career. 
I hope the Presiding Officer has a lot 
of years in front of him, but this is the 
most consequential thing this Congress 
has done, not just to fight poverty, lift 
poor kids and struggling parents who 
are working so hard to raise kids and 
balance two jobs and all that, not just 
to help kids get out of poverty but to 
make life easier. 
As I said, 90 percent of the families 
who have children under 18 in Georgia, 
in Ohio, and every State in between are 
going to get a $3,000-a-year tax cut. 
That alone is so important. 
I wish my colleague from Texas 
would address why they all vote no. 
They have had two chances. It sounds 
like they are going to take their third 
chance and vote no again. 
I don’t understand it. Is it that the 
lobbyists who line up in Senator 
MCCONNELL’s office have some weird 
philosophy that markets always know 
better? Is it just that they don’t really 
care about helping kids? I don’t know 
what their logic is. I just know what 
our logic is, and it will make our coun-
try better. 
TRIBUTE TO ALYSSA BROCKINGTON 
Mr. President, I would like to honor 
a member of my staff who has been 
such a valuable part of our office, 
Alyssa Brockington. She is joining us 
in the Chamber today. 
She has done such important work on 
healthcare and on economic justice. 
She is moving on to a new oppor-
tunity—again, to fight for a lot of the 
people whom we fight for in our office. 
She is moving on at the end of the 
year. 
She has been with our office for 5 
years, working to expand access to 
healthcare for Ohioans, for people 
around the country and to bring down 
drug prices and healthcare costs, one of 
the major goals of Build Back Better. 
She has worked to make sure that not 
only can families afford to see a doctor 
but that the care they get actually 
makes them healthier and serves their 
needs. We know that so often that isn’t 
the case for too many people, espe-
cially the most vulnerable. 
Last year, Ms. Brockington led ef-
forts in the Senate, with me, to intro-
duce a resolution declaring racism a 
public health crisis. And this is an ef-
fort, but what I love about this effort is 
that, in the first place, it really kind of 
happened. It started at the community 
level, in Hamilton County, Ohio, in the 
Cincinnati area. Other communities in 
the State began to pass resolutions to 
declare racism a public health crisis. 
She worked with leaders. She worked 
with advocates in these communities. 
She worked with organizations like the 
National Urban League and the YWCA 
and other Senate offices to introduce a 
resolution. It acknowledges the sys-
temic barriers that people of color, es-
pecially Black Americans, continue to 
face in our healthcare system. 
The first step to solving this problem 
is recognizing its existence and under-
standing it. Some of us in this Cham-
ber have read the 1619 Project. It has 
just come out. It came out of a New 
York Times very lengthy, very detailed 
series of articles. This is what Ms. 
Brockington is helping to address, 
some of these endemic problems we 
face. She has always pushed our office 
to recognize the issues and the people 
that too often get overlooked in this 
town. 
Ms. Brockington led efforts in our of-
fice to work to prevent maternal mor-
tality, 
working 
on 
bills 
like 
the 
Healthy Moms Act and the Supporting 
Best Practices for Healthy Moms Act. 
Mothers—we know especially young 
mothers of color—are dying at an 
alarming rate in this country. It is 
pretty 
unbelievable 
that 
so 
many 
women still die in childbirth in the 
richest country in the world. We have 
the best healthcare, to be sure, but it

doesn’t, let’s say, trickle down to ev-
erybody in this country. 
Despite having the best hospitals and 
the best doctors in the world, deaths 
are going up, not down. The legislation 
Alyssa has championed would help ex-
pand coverage options for pregnant 
mothers so they can get the care they 
need to have healthy pregnancies and 
healthy babies. 
Thanks to her hard work and thanks 
to my colleague and my friend Senator 
WYDEN, we included a provision from 
the Healthy Moms Act that would pro-
vide 
postpartum 
women 
with 
12 
months of Medicaid coverage in the 
Build Back Better bill. 
I mean, think about that—these 
women now who give birth will have 12 
months of Medicaid coverage—what 
that can mean, actually having insur-
ance, not having to worry as your col-
icky baby at several weeks old is keep-
ing you awake at night and suffering, 
and you are thinking also in your 
mind: How am I going to pay if I take 
her to the doctor? How am I going to 
pay? How am I going to afford this cov-
erage? 
This does that. 
Another major contribution Alyssa 
has made to our office is her leadership 
informing and guiding our Economic 
Justice Task Force. Economic justice 
is central to everything we do for the 
people of Ohio. 
I would notice—and I know I am not 
allowed to wear this on the floor. So I 
will just hold it up, if that doesn’t vio-
late the rules. 
I ran in today and I met briefly with 
one of the workers who makes food in 
this building. They just joined and 
formed Local 23 of UNITE HERE. What 
that is going to mean for her life, what 
that is going to mean for workers, that 
they have somebody now representing 
them, bargaining for better wages, bet-
ter benefits—we know the cafeteria 
workers here, the people who work to 
serve us, were making as little as $11 
and $12 an hour. 
This Economic Justice Task Force 
will mean our office will do better to 
engage communities that are over-
looked, to discuss and champion issues 
that are central to Ohio communities 
and to the workers here and all over 
the country, communities that don’t 
often have much of a voice in the gov-
ernment. 
She has been the driving force behind 
this task force for 2 full years now, or-
ganizing meetings, facilitating discus-
sions, encouraging colleagues to get in-
volved and speak up. She coordinates 
with other staff. She plans quarterly 
events. She circulates ideas for feed-
back. 
One colleague said: All around, she is 
so inclusive and empathetic. As you 
work in this job and work in these jobs, 
having staff that is kind and inclusive 
and empathetic is sort of everything 
because they will treat the citizens of 
Alaska or Georgia or Ohio with that 
empathy and with that kindness. She 
has been that kind of asset to our of-
fice and to our work for the people of 
Ohio. 
We will miss her dearly. I know she 
will continue to do wonderful things to 
ensure more Americans get the com-
passionate and affordable and effective 
healthcare they need. 
I am excited. We hate to lose her, but 
we like her next challenge, and we are 
excited to see how far she will go. 
Thank you, Alyssa, for your service 
to Ohio and to our country. We will 
miss you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to come down to the Senate floor 
and commend a number of Senators, 
but I want to particularly commend 
the chairman of the Armed Services 
Committee, Senator REED, and the 
ranking member, Senator INHOFE, and 
their staff, and all the staff on the 
Armed Services Committee for the ex-
ceptional work they have done over the 
last several months to produce the 
strong National Defense Authorization 
Act that just passed in a very strong 
bipartisan vote here on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. 
That vote was 88 to 11. I think it is a 
prime example of something that I 
mention a lot back home; and that is 
that there is a lot more bipartisan 
work that gets done here in the Senate 
that isn’t often recognized, and there is 
nothing more important than having 
Senators from both sides of the aisle 
come together with regard to national 
defense and supporting our troops and 
their families. 
We have been doing that over 60 
years in a row, where we have passed 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act—one of the most important bills 
that comes to the floor of the Senate 
and the House and the Congress. And, 
once again, we have passed it. And I 
think Chairman REED
and Senator 
INHOFE—Ranking Member INHOFE—de-
serve a lot of the credit. 
So I just want to touch on a couple of 
the key provisions here, a lot of what 
was in it, and then mention a few 
things. A lot of times it is important to 
recognize, actually, what is not in a 
bill because that can be just as impor-
tant as what is in it. 
But I would start with the No. 1 issue 
here, and it is the top-line budget in-
crease for the Department of Defense. 
I have been outspoken on the dis-
appointment and damage that Presi-
dent Biden’s budget, which he pro-
posed, with regard to the Pentagon, 
supported, 
unfortunately, 
by 
many 
here—the majority leader, the budget 
chairman—that that was unaccept-
able—unacceptable. Why was it unac-
ceptable? Because our Nation is facing 
many threats right now. Just read the 
paper every day—China, Russia, Iran. 
Yet that budget that was actually pro-
vided by the White House was a cut—a 
pretty dramatic cut—if you look at it 
as adjusted for inflation. 
The Armed Services Committees in 
the Senate and in the House thor-
oughly rejected the Biden budget to 
cut defense spending. 
We have in this bill a 3-percent real 
increase. That is a little over $25 bil-
lion. This amendment, which I cospon-
sored with Senator INHOFE and others, 
to increase our defense spending, when 
it came to a vote in the committee, 
every Senator on the Armed Services 
Committee voted for it, with the excep-
tion of one. That is about as bipartisan 
as it gets. 
There are many important things in 
this bill in terms of the significant in-
crease to the top-line budget, but read-
iness, in my view, of our military is 
one of the most important things we do 
here as U.S. Senators, and now is cer-
tainly not the time to cut defense 
spending. I think today’s vote was a 
strong bipartisan showing that this 
body does not agree with the Biden 
budget, and that was one really impor-
tant aspect of today’s NDAA. 
Second, I want to talk a little bit 
about the great State of Alaska and its 
role in our military and some of the 
provisions in this bill that relate to 
Arctic security. 
I like to say that Alaska constitutes 
three pillars of America’s military 
might. We are the cornerstone of mis-
sile defense. Almost all the radar sys-
tems and all the ground-based missile 
interceptors 
protecting 
the 
whole 
country are located in Alaska. 
We are the hub of air combat power 
for the Arctic and Asia Pacific. By the 
end of this year, we will have over 100 
fifth-generation 
fighters—combat- 
coded, fifth-gen fighters. That is F–35s, 
F–22s, stationed in Alaska—over 100. 
There is no place on the planet Earth 
that has over 100 fifth-generation fight-
ers. Supersonic stealth can get any-
where—anywhere—very quickly: Rus-
sia, China, Taiwan. That is another 
area of Alaska’s pillars of military 
might. 
And, finally, we are a platform for 
expeditionary forces, the 4–25, the only 
airborne brigade combat team in the 
entire Asia Pacific; the First Striker 
Brigade; and many others that can get 
to places all over the world, because of 
our strategic location, very quickly, 
and also because of our strategic airlift 
in Alaska. 
But this NDAA is going to add an-
other element of Alaska’s military 
might to our Nation, and that is the 
center of gravity for America’s Arctic 
security operations. 
Last year in the NDAA, we were able 
to get the first and only and much 
needed Department of Defense Center 
for Arctic Security. The Department of 
Defense named it the Ted Stevens, 
after the great, late Senator. The Cen-
ter for Arctic Security is going to be in 
Anchorage, AK. 
And now, in this year’s NDAA, we 
have what is called the Arctic Security 
Initiative. I was honored to cosponsor 
that with my good friend Senator KING

from Maine. And this gets the Pen-
tagon to focus on a 5-year strength-
ening of our national security in the 
Arctic region. 
As you know, that is becoming an 
area of great power competition, and 
America has very strong, strategic na-
tional security and economic security 
interests in the Arctic. And this NDAA 
will cement not just the Arctic as an 
important national security impera-
tive of our country but Alaska as the 
focal point for Arctic security endeav-
ors for the United States and our al-
lies. 
The other element here in the NDAA 
which is so important, of course, is 
taking care of our troops and their 
families. This bill authorizes a pay 
raise of almost 3 percent for both mili-
tary members and Department of De-
fense civilians. It has numerous initia-
tives relating to military health and 
housing leave policies. One that I was 
proud to get into this bill is an impor-
tant provision that allows the Depart-
ment of Defense and the Veterans Ad-
ministration to do facility sharing. 
What does that mean? It enables both 
the Pentagon and the VA to work on 
agreements to plan, design, and con-
struct facilities to operate as VA and 
DOD shared medical facilities. That is 
going to help with readiness. That is 
going to help train our young Active- 
Duty medical forces. It is going to help 
with taking care of our veterans. And 
it is going to save money. 
These are the kinds of provisions 
that we need. They are win-win-win be-
tween the VA and our veterans and the 
Active-Duty and Reserve forces that 
also need healthcare. And we are look-
ing forward to taking advantage of 
that in Alaska and in other places in 
the country. 
As I said at the outset, oftentimes 
what is not in a bill is as important as 
what is in a bill, and some of our Mem-
bers—some of the far-left Members of 
the House—tried to plug into the 
NDAA—and they did so over in the 
House—a number of bills that really 
didn’t have a lot to do with the mili-
tary, but they were trying to move for-
ward on a far-left agenda that they 
tried to attach in the NDAA. 
Ironically, many of these Members 
really have no intention of ever voting 
for a strong NDAA, but they tried to 
plug things in, in the House bill. They 
did that in the House bill, but we were 
able to get rid of pretty much all of 
those—again, things like redflag laws 
that would confiscate firearms without 
due process. 
There is another provision that I am 
really glad was not in there. There has 
been this narrative on the far left that 
somehow the men and women of our 
military—that our military institu-
tions—are filled with a bunch of ex-
tremists. There are news reports that 
say this. None of it is based on data. 
None of it is based on data. And I have 
been pressing officials, saying: Give me 
data. You make these charges, which I 
dislike. I happen to know many, many 
members of the military. They are 
some of the finest people in the coun-
try. 
So we were able to get rid of some of 
the provisions in the House bill that— 
one was going to set up an office in the 
Pentagon on essentially trying to, in 
my view, do witch hunts on so-called 
extremists. It is an issue that the Pen-
tagon needs to come up with data on 
and not make these false charges. 
So, overall, this is a good day for our 
troops, for their families, for the Sen-
ate. It is a very bipartisan bill, with 
people 
coming 
together—Democrats 
and Republicans—on, in my view, one 
of the most important issues, if not the 
most important issue, we deal with 
here in the Congress: the national secu-
rity of our Nation; keeping a strong, le-
thal military. 
And when we do that, like we did 
today, that also sends a message to our 
adversaries: The United States, despite 
some challenges, still has the best, 
most lethal military force in the world, 
the most professional military force in 
the world. And this bill is going to help 
enhance that, and our adversaries need 
to take notice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
ENERGY SAVINGS AND INDUSTRIAL 
COMPETITIVENESS ACT 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am 
really pleased to be on the floor this 
afternoon with my friend and colleague 
Senator ROB PORTMAN to talk about an 
issue that we have been working on, 
literally, for a decade, and it has been 
a bipartisan effort to focus on energy 
efficiency as a response to the energy 
needs in this country. 
In 2011, Senator PORTMAN and I intro-
duced S. 1000, which was the first 
version of the Energy Savings and In-
dustrial Competitiveness Act. Over the 
years, it has been known as Shaheen- 
Portman, when we were in the major-
ity 
on 
the 
Democratic 
side, 
or 
Portman-Shaheen, when the Repub-
licans were in the majority. 
But it doesn’t matter what you call 
it. Our bill has proposed substantial in-
vestments in energy efficiency in this 
country, and what we did in the bill 
was to focus on the most energy-inten-
sive sectors in our economy: buildings, 
residential and commercial, which is 
about a third of our energy use; the in-
dustrial sector; and the Federal Gov-
ernment. And, in the United States, 
the biggest user of energy is the Fed-
eral Government. 
In a Congress that is divided along 
partisan lines on so many issues, en-
ergy efficiency is one priority that can 
bring us together on a bipartisan, bi-
cameral basis to get things done. I al-
ways like to say that energy efficiency 
is one of those energy sources that you 
can support whether you are from New 
England or Ohio or Wyoming. Whether 
you support oil and gas or wind and 
solar, energy efficiency is the fastest, 
cheapest way to meet our energy 
needs. 
Our legislation has always focused on 
low-cost tools and adoption of off-the- 
shelf technologies to save money for 
consumers and businesses, to make 
America more energy independent, and 
to reduce emissions. 
And over the years, over the last dec-
ade, we have had some big wins. In 
2015, President Obama signed a tar-
geted version of Shaheen-Portman, the 
Energy Efficiency Improvement Act, 
into law. That bill helped align the in-
terests of commercial building owners 
and their tenants to reduce energy con-
sumption, and it allowed certain water 
heaters to help with demand response 
programs in rural areas. 
Now, we have also made great strides 
through annual appropriations and ad-
ministrative actions on things like en-
ergy efficiency standards for appli-
ances. 
Of course, we have also had some real 
defeats. But, though frustrating, as 
those defeats were, our resolve on this 
bill has never wavered, and when we re-
introduced Portman-Shaheen last Con-
gress, we worked to again incorporate 
feedback from stakeholders. For 7 
months, our staffs held back-to-back 
meetings 
with 
constituents, 
stake-
holders, and committee staff to ensure 
the bill addressed the energy needs in 
New Hampshire, Ohio, and the rest of 
the country. 
Improving the efficiency of residen-
tial and commercial buildings through 
energy-saving building codes remained 
central to our bill, as did industrial en-
ergy efficiency provisions and improve-
ments to Federal energy efficiency pro-
grams. 
We also, again, included energy effi-
ciency bills from our colleagues. So in 
that piece of legislation, we included 
Senators MURKOWSKI
and MANCHIN’s 
Federal Energy and Water Manage-
ment Performance Act. We included 
Senators HOEVEN and MANCHIN’s All-of- 
the-Above Federal Building Energy 
Conservation Act. And we included 
Senator COLLINS and WARNER’s legisla-
tion coordinating the energy retro-
fitting for schools. Finally, as part of 
that, we included Senator BENNET and 
Senator ISAKSON’s Sensible Accounting 
to Value Energy Act, or the SAVE Act. 
So there were a lot of reasons why a 
number of Members of this body were 
interested in that legislation. But it 
was also a real savings because, accord-
ing to the American Council for an En-
ergy Efficient Economy, the policies 
from that bill would save consumers 
over $51 billion on their energy bills. It 
would reduce carbon emissions by 1.3 
billion metric tons, which is the equiv-
alent of taking 280 million cars off the 
road for a year. And it would save 32 
quadrillion Btus of energy, which is 
nearly the total energy use of all U.S. 
industries for 1 year. 
Now, a previous study from ACEEE 
also estimated that the legislation 
would add more than 100,000 jobs to the 
economy. That bill passed the Energy 
and Natural Resources Committee by a 
vote of 14 to 6, and it was the fifth

time—fifth time—the bill passed in 
committee on a bipartisan basis. 
Now, I am proud to say that the En-
ergy Policy Act of 2020 that was signed 
into law by President Trump at the end 
of last year had several provisions from 
that Shaheen-Portman legislation that 
would 
streamline 
efficiency 
for 
schools, increase energy efficiency for 
Federal data centers, provide rebates 
for energy-efficient electric motors and 
transformers, and support Federal en-
ergy 
efficiency 
programs. 
But, 
of 
course, a piece of that bill was left on 
the cutting room floor, with the vol-
untary building codes, where so much 
of the savings was really incorporated. 
But despite the success and the de-
feat in the last Congress, we came into 
this year as determined as ever. And as 
part of the original Gang of 10, Senator 
PORTMAN and I teamed up to ensure 
that energy efficiency was a big part of 
the bipartisan infrastructure frame-
work. 
We worked with Senator MANCHIN 
and our bipartisan colleagues to incor-
porate much of Shaheen-Portman with 
funding in the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act. 
I am going to turn it over to Senator 
PORTMAN for a few minutes so my voice 
can recover, and then I will pick it up 
when he finishes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first 
of all, it is great to be on the floor with 
my friend JEANNE SHAHEEN and talk 
about something positive, something 
that we have been able to accomplish 
over the years—as she said, we have 
been at this over a decade—which is to 
encourage more energy efficiency. This 
is the ability for us to save energy by 
not using it. It is, therefore, sort of en-
ergy found. It is also an ability to im-
prove the economy because it creates 
more jobs and makes us more competi-
tive globally by having lower energy 
costs. 
Think about the businesses in your 
State. The competitive nature of busi-
ness today is that you are really com-
peting with the Europeans and the Jap-
anese and the Chinese and so on, and if 
you have higher energy costs and you 
are not energy efficient, you are not 
going to be competitive. 
But if you are competitive, it adds 
jobs and makes the economy stronger. 
So the way I look at it, if you are in-
terested in lower emissions and a bet-
ter environment and, at the same time, 
you are interested in a better economy 
and creating jobs, then energy effi-
ciency is the low-hanging fruit. That is 
the thing we can all agree with. 
I applaud Senator SHAHEEN because 
she has been patient. We have both 
been patient, as our staffs have been, 
over the years, in getting pieces of our 
legislation in various bills that have 
passed this U.S. Senate and the House 
of Representatives and been signed into 
law by President Obama, President 
Trump, and now President Biden. 
The most recent one was the infra-
structure bill, and it is exciting what 
we were able to get in there in terms of 
encouraging a better, more sustainable 
use of our energy resources in both the 
public sector and in the private sector. 
Importantly, energy efficiency is also 
a part of a more reliable and resilient 
grid, which was part of our legislation: 
improving the electrical grid. 
We have had some pretty severe 
weather events over the last year, as 
you know. I was just in Kentucky over 
the weekend, my neighboring State, 
helping out on the cleanup there. And, 
boy, electricity was out everywhere. 
By improving energy efficiency, we 
can reduce demand, taking pressure off 
our power grids, and help create more 
stability. 
These are some of the reasons why, 
since 2011, we have worked together to 
promote this energy efficiency bill 
called the Energy Savings and Indus-
trial 
Competitiveness 
Act. 
Senator 
SHAHEEN called it Portman-Shaheen. I 
call it Shaheen-Portman because she is 
in charge now. The Senate is in the 
Democrats’ majority, not ours. But we 
have worked together seamlessly. It 
has really been nonpartisan. 
And, again, our goal has been, really, 
three different areas. One is residential 
and 
commercial 
buildings, 
because 
that is where we use a lot of energy. 
About 40 percent of the energy used in 
this country is used there. 
Also, to ensure that the Federal Gov-
ernment does a better job. The Federal 
Government uses more energy than 
any other entity in the entire econ-
omy. By the way, it uses more energy 
than anybody in the world. And they 
don’t do it very efficiently. In fact, 
there is a lot of energy inefficiency in 
our Federal Government. 
So practice what you preach, right? 
So you have the government telling ev-
erybody else they have got to be green, 
but the government itself is not green. 
So our legislation requires that the 
Federal Government take steps to 
make it more energy efficient as well. 
And then, finally, the manufacturing 
sector. Here is where there is a great 
opportunity, and manufacturers are 
really excited about it because we can 
provide some incentives, some best 
practices, and so on to make them 
more competitive globally by improv-
ing their energy efficiency. 
We have created a big tent through 
this process, joining forces with our 
colleagues over the years for the pur-
pose of supporting these kind of com-
monsense energy efficiency measures. 
A number of Senators who have had 
important parts of our legislation in-
clude Senator WICKER, Senator BEN-
NET, 
Senator 
COLLINS, 
Senator 
MANCHIN, Senator HOEVEN, and oth-
ers—Senator MURKOWSKI. 
Our legislation has been voted on by 
this body before. In 2016, it passed the 
U.S. Senate. It also passed out of the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee five separate times with bipar-
tisan support. 
By the way, in 2016, the vote was 85 
to 12. Now, it was part of a larger en-
ergy package, but that was a pretty 
strong sign of bipartisan support for 
this. And it improved energy effi-
ciency, in that case, in leased office 
space and improved energy savings 
from water heaters, as an example. 
However, we have long recognized we 
need to do more to be able to save en-
ergy and save money. According to the 
U.S. Energy Information Administra-
tion, residential and commercial build-
ings accounted for 40 percent of total 
energy consumption. In addition, re-
ports from the U.S. Department of En-
ergy have found that the Federal Gov-
ernment, again, is the single largest 
energy consumer in the country. And 
those studies have shown that our leg-
islation as a whole would save con-
sumers $51 billion on energy bills, re-
duce carbon emissions by 1.3 billion 
tons—not by hurting jobs—by creating 
more jobs because it would add more 
than 100,000 jobs to the economy. 
Over the years, our legislation has 
gained the support of industry, such as 
the National Association of Manufac-
turers, American Chemistry Council, 
and U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It has 
the support of commercial and real es-
tate developers like BOMA and the 
Real Estate Roundtable, as well as 
from efficiency advocates and the envi-
ronmental community like the Alli-
ance to Save Energy, called ACEEE. 
There is not a lot in Washington 
these days that has such a broad group 
of stakeholders supporting it. But 
there is a reason this legislation has 
received such broad support. It reduces 
emissions by reducing energy consump-
tion. It also creates new jobs and low-
ers energy bills for consumers. And it 
does all this without putting any new 
mandates on the private sector. Par-
ticularly now, at a time of record infla-
tion and rising energy costs, investing 
and improving energy efficiency is a 
smart way to help support hard-work-
ing families in Ohio and around the 
country. 
The good news is that now, with the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill signed 
into law, we are much closer to seeing 
the benefits for the American people 
become a reality. The infrastructure 
bill, which we coauthored along with a 
bunch of our colleagues, included a 
total of $2.5 billion for various energy 
efficiency projects. Included in these 
critical investments are a number of 
our provisions from Shaheen-Portman. 
For example, we were able to include 
and fund programs to help incentivize 
contractors, homebuilders, and others 
to adapt and implement updated build-
ing codes. We were also able to fund 
programs that will help career skills 
development to help us train a work-
force able to develop and install impor-
tant 
new 
energy 
efficiency 
tech-
nologies. That has been one of our 
challenges. 
For example, we include funding to 
enhance 
the 
Industrial 
Assessment 
Centers Program at the Department of 
Energy. This program allows students 
from around the country to conduct

energy assessments and small- and me-
dium-sized manufacturers to improve 
their competitiveness, reduce waste, 
save energy, while at the same time 
training students in the field. 
By the way, it is these kinds of small 
changes and upgrades that can result 
in big emissions and cost savings for 
businesses all around the country. So I 
am truly proud of what we have accom-
plished, including the infrastructure 
bill most recently. 
Again, I want to thank my colleague 
Senator SHAHEEN for her tireless work 
to get this legislation across the finish 
line—again, energy efficiency, the low- 
hanging fruit. I look forward to con-
tinuing our partnership on these im-
portant issues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I 
thank my colleague and partner in this 
effort, Senator PORTMAN. And as he 
pointed out, on November 15, President 
Biden became the third President to 
sign energy efficiency provisions from 
our bill into law. 
Now, we still have a lot of work to 
do. But I just want to recognize current 
and former Shaheen-Portman staff who 
have helped us shepherd this bill 
through its many obstacles. 
From my staff, I want to thank Trent 
Bauserman, Robert Diznoff, Ariel Mar-
shall, 
Drew 
Story, 
and 
Janelle 
DiLuccia. 
From Senator PORTMAN’s staff, I 
want to thank Pam Thiessen, Steve 
Kittredge, Pat Orth, Sarah Peery, and 
Lydia Denis. 
I would like to ask unanimous con-
sent to enter the names of these cur-
rent and former staff into the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Energy and Natural Resources Committee 
staff who have played a pivotal role in the 
advancement of the Energy Savings and In-
dustrial Competitiveness Act over the years: 
Brie Van Cleve, Adam Berry, Al Stayman, 
Sam Fowler, Renae Black, Sarah Venuto, 
Angela Becker Dippman, Mary Louise Wag-
oner, Joshua Sheinkman, Colin Hayes, and 
Brian Hughes. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Finally, I want to 
thank the chairs and ranking members 
of the Energy and Natural Resources 
Committee who have played such a piv-
otal role over the years: Senators 
MANCHIN, MURKOWSKI, CANTWELL
and 
WYDEN and their staffs. 
Senator PORTMAN talked about all of 
the various groups who have been in-
volved in helping to move this legisla-
tion where we are today. So I won’t go 
back over those. But I will say, again, 
energy efficiency is a win, win, win. It 
create jobs; it reduces cost to con-
sumers; and it lowers emissions. 
And as our economy recovers and 
grows, the investments in energy effi-
ciency from our bipartisan infrastruc-
ture package are going to make sure 
that we use energy smarter. And I am 
going continue to partner with Senator 
PORTMAN and others so we can unlock 
the full potential of energy efficiency 
for our growing economy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak as if in 
morning business for such time as I 
shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ETHIOPIA 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think, 
with Christmas right around the cor-
ner, I can’t think of a more appropriate 
time to deliver a short message here. 
I have spoken several times about 
the situation in Ethiopia this year. It 
is a nation that is close to my heart for 
a lot of good reasons. It is close to 
other hearts around here. And if you 
are trying to understand the politics 
behind what is happening on the 
ground, it is very complicated. 
But what is not complicated is that 
human suffering happens, and it is 
heartbreaking. We are talking about 
women and children and the elderly 
people. And they are dying every day. 
And it is totally unnecessary. I pray 
the violence stops very quickly and 
call on those who feel the same way to 
join me if they agree with this. 
One of my big criticisms of our State 
Department is that they tend to go 
around the world telling other coun-
tries what they need to do instead of 
focusing on building lasting friendships 
and alliances. 
This pushes countries away from us 
instead of bringing them toward us. 
And we can’t afford to do that anymore 
with the rising problems that we are 
having right now—we have been talk-
ing on the floor—with both China and 
Russia. And those countries are all too 
eager to pick up the pieces that we 
leave behind. And this is happening 
right now. We are faced with a situa-
tion where we have countries that are 
out there that have actually better re-
sources than we do in many areas. 
Unfortunately, this is exactly what 
the Biden administration is doing in 
Ethiopia. Because Ethiopia has been 
unable to resolve its internal chal-
lenges quick enough for the adminis-
tration, they are punishing Ethiopia. 
They are really punishing their own 
people here. 
Most recently, this has been in the 
form of announcing that they plan to 
remove Ethiopia from the African 
Growth and Opportunity Act. The Afri-
can Growth and Opportunity Act is 
known as AGOA. And it is something 
that is very significant. It is one that 
all of those in Africa and other coun-
tries are trying to get behind them. 
And I think it is particularly signifi-
cant right now that Christmas is upon 
us. It means Ethiopia would no longer 
have preferential trade capabilities 
with the United States for both import 
and export. 
Now, this is devastating to a nation 
that has been such a great partner over 
the years. Ethiopia has always—ever 
since it came back during the Meles 
administration, and we kicked com-
munists out with the help of that ad-
ministration, it has been our friend 
ever since then. Ethiopia has long been 
one of our last trading partners in Afri-
ca, in part, because its airline has a 
majority Boeing fleet. And because of 
that, many planes across the continent 
are being maintained in Ethiopia. 
This flippant action makes our other 
partners doubt our commitment and 
pulls the rug out from many American 
business that have decided to make in-
vestments in Ethiopia instead of other 
countries in places around the world 
like Southeast Asia. 
If we are willing to arbitrarily kick 
countries out of the agreement, other 
countries 
and 
American 
companies 
might not see participation in AGOA 
as worth the hassle you have to go 
through to get that. Every time we do 
something like this, we leave a vacuum 
that China is only too eager to fill. 
Just after the Biden administration 
announced their plan to punish Ethi-
opia, the Chinese Government an-
nounced their own plan to purchase 
$300 billion worth of goods from Africa 
over the next 3 years and to invest 
nearly $10 billion. 
The 
Chinese 
Foreign 
Minister 
promptly visited the principals in Ethi-
opia to support Prime Minister Abiy. 
Prime Minister Abiy, whom you might 
remember, has been a Prime Minister 
in Ethiopia for a long period of time. I 
can remember standing many years 
ago on this floor and lauding the vir-
tues of him and what he has done for 
this country and the fact that he prob-
ably could be arguably the best edu-
cated Prime Minister in that country 
at any time. He didn’t mention a word 
about the international challenges that 
he faces. They were there to support 
him, the democratically—we are talk-
ing about the Chinese now—democrat-
ically elected leader in Ethiopia. That 
is exactly what we should be doing. But 
we aren’t—and China is. 
We know that China and Russia are 
encroaching throughout Africa. They 
want nothing more than to create a di-
vision between the United States and 
Ethiopia and in countries across the 
continent. 
And the good news is—if you can call 
it that—there is time before the Biden 
administration cancels AGOA benefits, 
and that would be for Ethiopia on Jan-
uary 1. But the door is closing. And 
January 1 is on us now. 
So the Biden administration should 
take real steps to undoing the sanc-
tions against the democratically elect-
ed government of Ethiopia and roll 
back the termination of AGOA bene-
fits. And that would make a much 
happier Christmas for us and for Ethi-
opia. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

f 
40TH ANNIVERSARY OF S. RES. 268 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to take note of the enduring sup-
port by the American people and by 
this body for the cause of democracy 
and human rights in Poland. 
It is difficult to acknowledge so 
much time has passed, but it was 40 
years ago this week, on December 13, 
1981, 
that 
the 
Soviet-backed 
com-
munist 
government 
and 
General 
Wojciech Jaruzelski declared a state of 
war in Poland. People called it ‘‘mar-
tial law;’’ in fact, it was quite literally 
a war declared by a government on its 
own people. 
The U.S. Senate, led by the late 
statesman and Senator from New York, 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, acted quick-
ly to adopt S. Res. 268. On December 15, 
on the last day of the first session of 
the 97th Congress, this body adopted by 
vote of 95 to 0, S. Res. 268, ‘‘on the im-
position of martial law in Poland.’’ 
The resolution declared that: 
‘‘it is the clear and unassailable right of 
the Polish people collectively to determine 
their own future’’ 
It also directed that: 
‘‘the President and his Administration 
should consult intensively with our allies to 
develop a concerted and sustained response 
to the threat to the democratization process 
in Poland.’’ 
By 1989, thanks to continuing support 
for the people of Poland that this Sen-
ate expressed 40 years ago today, de-
mocracy prevailed in Poland. 
Only two Members of today’s Senate 
were present and voting on December 
15, 1981, and I want to express my ap-
preciation, these many years later, for 
their support for the resolution: Sen-
ator CHARLES GRASSLEY of Iowa, then 
in his very first year in the Senate, and 
Senator PATRICK LEAHY, then already 
in his second term in the Senate. 
The 
trade 
union 
Solidarity 
had 
emerged on August 31, 1980, at the 
Gdansk Shipyard when the communist 
government of Poland signed the agree-
ment allowing for its existence. Lech 
Walesa and others soon formed a broad 
anti-Soviet social movement ranging 
from people associated with the Catho-
lic Church to members of the anti-So-
viet left. Polish nationalism, together 
with pro-American liberalism, played 
an important part in the development 
of Solidarity in the 1980s. Solidarity 
advocated nonviolence in its members’ 
activities. In September 1981, Solidar-
ity’s first national congress elected 
Walesa as its president and adopted a 
republican 
program, 
the 
‘‘Self-gov-
erning Republic’’. 
The 
first 
resolution 
adopted 
by 
Solidarnosc, at its First Congress in 
1981, expressed a vision for the world, 
one based on the principle of its name. 
It stated: 
The ultimate goal of Solidarity is to create 
dignified conditions of life in an economi-
cally and politically sovereign Poland. By 
this, we mean a life free from poverty, ex-
ploitation, fear and lies, in a democratically 
and legally organized society. 
By December, the government in 
Warsaw and its backers in Moscow de-
cided that they had enough of an asser-
tive civil society. And so martial law 
was declared and the repression com-
menced, 40 years ago this week. 
The terrible repression next door in 
Belarus today compares, but even it 
does not match the brute force of the 
war against the people of Poland de-
clared by General Jaruzelski, the si-
multaneous deployment of hundreds of 
thousands 
of 
riot 
police, 
soldiers, 
armed vehicles, and tanks to occupy all 
workplaces and cities and to crush the 
resistance of an entire society orga-
nized in independent, self-governing 
unions. Yet Solidarity lived. 
A democratic movement in Belarus 
also lives today. It is not inevitable, 
however, that it will win, just as it was 
not inevitable that Solidarity would 
win. Much depended on the indomitable 
will of the Polish people—and also on 
the actions of Western democracies. 
The first people in the United States 
to stand up on behalf of the people of 
Poland were writers and intellectuals 
who formed the Committee in Support

December 15, 2021 
of Solidarity, including Susan Sontag, 
Adam Ulam, Czeslaw Milosz, and oth-
ers. An energetic young man named 
Eric Chenowith and wise strategist 
named Irena Lasoda soon became fa-
miliar faces in the Halls of Congress, 
circulating 
information 
about 
the 
struggle of solidarity and people in Po-
land to endure the repression they con-
fronted. 
The political force that kept the 
democratic world focused on support 
for the people of Poland then was the 
American labor movement, led by its 
president Lane Kirkland and his sec-
retary-treasurer Tom Donahue. They 
immediately 
established 
the 
AFL– 
CIO’s Polish Workers Aid Fund and put 
Tom Kahn, the international affairs di-
rector of the AFL–CIO, at its helm. 
They persisted in making the steady 
argument, even after December 1981, 
that in Solidarnosc lay the potential 
for a new, more democratic, more just, 
and more peaceful world. 
It was the AFL–CIO, representing 16 
million people, that gave voice and 
strength to the free trade union Soli-
darity in the United States. We forget 
how many were willing to forsake Soli-
darity in the period of martial law. In-
deed, only the AFL–CIO, backed by the 
committee, 
pressured 
President 
Reagan 
and 
his administration to 
adopt stronger sanctions in response to 
the state of war. As importantly, it was 
the AFL–CIO that made sure Solidarity 
was sustained through financial and 
material help, some of which was sup-
ported by the National Endowment for 
Democracy, after its creation in 1984. 
Thanks to that support and stead-
fastness, eventually the government 
relented, 
especially 
once 
Mikhail 
Gorbachev rose to power in the USSR 
and began to pull back the support for 
the repressive policies in Poland and 
elsewhere in the Warsaw Pact. 
Roundtable Talks between the gov-
ernment and Solidarity-led opposition 
led to semi-free elections in June of 
1989. In an arrangement that was simi-
lar in some ways to what transpired 
more recently in Burma, partially free 
elections were organized in which a 
large block of seats in the legislature 
were reserved—in the case of Burma for 
the military and in the case of Poland, 
in 1989, for the Communist party and 
its allies. 
All seats in the newly recreated Sen-
ate of Poland were to be elected demo-
cratically, as were 161 seats—35 percent 
of the total—in Sejm. The remaining 65 
percent of the seats in the Sejm were 
reserved for the Polish United Workers’ 
Party—the Communist Party—and its 
satellite parties. These seats were still 
technically elected, but only govern-
ment-sponsored candidates were al-
lowed to compete for them. In addition, 
all 35 seats elected via the countrywide 
list were reserved for the Communist 
Party’s candidates to ensure that the 
most notable leaders of the Polish 
United Workers Party were elected. 
But in the June elections, the people 
of Poland voted so overwhelmingly for 
the representatives nominated by Soli-
darity that the Communists and the 
military lost all credibility. By the end 
of August, a Solidarity-led coalition 
government was formed, and in Decem-
ber, Tadeusz Mazowiecki was elected 
Prime Minister. 
Poland has since then developed into 
such a strong democracy and economi-
cally liberal country that it has led its 
neighbors into joining the European 
Union and the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. It has become in every 
sense an ally of the United States. And 
in the past 2 years, it has again been 
true to the heritage of Solidarity by 
providing safe haven for many political 
refugees from Belarus and elsewhere. 
While many of us continue to have 
concerns about some aspects of Polish 
Government policy, its treatment of 
certain media outlets, and the fate of 
the rule-of-law in the country, the gov-
ernment of Poland is a friend with 
whom we can have honest conversa-
tions. Indeed, I am sitting down later 
this afternoon with the newly arrived 
Polish 
ambassador 
to 
Washington, 
Marek Magierowsk, to continue these 
conversations. This is especially im-
portant at this time because Poland 
will 
become 
the 
chairman-in-office 
next month of the Organization for Se-
curity and Cooperation in Europe—the 
OSCE—and will play a major role in 
shaping the OSCE’s response to efforts 
by Russia and others to undermine the 
work of the organization and stability 
in the region. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the full text of S. Res. 268 
from the 97th Congress, as adopted on 
December 15, 1981, be printed in the 
RECORD at this point, along with the 
announcement of December 15, 1981, of 
the creation of the Committee in sup-
port of Solidarity. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
S. RES. 268 
Whereas the American and Polish peoples 
share a deep and abiding friendship; 
Whereas the imposition of martial law, and 
the suspension of workers’ rights in Poland 
on December 13, 1981, constitute grave 
abridgements of the human rights and civil 
liberties of the Polish people; 
Whereas it is the clear and unassailable 
right of the Polish people collectively to de-
termine their own future: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the American people desire an early and 
peaceful and popularly supported resolution 
of the issues which have led to the imposi-
tion of martial law in Poland; 
(2) the American people deplore the impo-
sition of martial law in Poland, the suspen-
sion of the rights of workers to organize and 
peaceably to defend their interests, and the 
arrests of leaders of Solidarity; the free 
trade union; 
(3) recent events call into question the 
suitability of the further provision of assist-
ance to the government of Poland except for 
humanitarian programs; 
(4) it is the right of the Polish people to re-
solve their own problems without outside in-
terference of any kind; 
(5) the support of the American people for 
continued United States dealings with the 
present government of Poland will relate di-
rectly to the degree to which the Polish gov-
ernment avoids violence and bloodshed, and 
demonstrate by its actions its respect for a 
full and legitimate role for the Solidarity 
labor union and its commitment to the con-
tinuation of Poland’s reforms; 
(6) the President and the Secretary of 
State should continue to stress this United 
States position in all dealings with Polish of-
ficials; 
(7) the President and his Administration 
should consult intensively with our allies to 
develop a concerted and sustained response 
to the threat to the democratization process 
in Poland. 
COMMITTEE IN SUPPORT OF SOLIDARITY, 
New York, NY, December 15, 1981. 
WE, THE UNDERSIGNED, DECLARE: At mid-
night on December 13, 1981, the Polish army 
and police raided the offices of the Inde-
pendent Trade Union ‘‘Solidarity’’; thou-
sands, perhaps tens of thousands, of people 
were arrested in their homes. The Prime 
Minister, Minister of Defense and First Sec-
retary of the Polish Communist Party in one 
person, General Jaruzelski, declared martial 
law. 
Polish society, in whose overwhelming sup-
port Solidarity has its strength, has exer-
cised the utmost restraint in the face of 
countless acts of provocation on the part of 
the government. In the sixteen months of its 
existence, Solidarity has committed no ille-
gal acts; it has rigorously respected the Pol-
ish constitution and all the forms of political 
life accepted in civilized societies. Each and 
every voice from Solidarity, even if termed 
‘‘radical’’ by the Communist Party or the 
western media, has been no more than the 
exercise of that right to free and open discus-
sion of national affairs which is guaranteed 
by the constitution. The party and the gov-
ernment, on the other hand, have violated 
almost every agreement they have signed; 
they have also violated the basic right of all 
citizens to freedom of expression. 
The present events are not the ‘‘internal 
affairs of Poland.’’ The Soviet Union has 
been intervening in Polish internal affairs 
since 1944. The Junta of General Jaruzelski, 
by linking the arrests of Solidarity members 
to those of former party officials, is clearly 
attempting to blame Solidarity for the thir-
ty-six years of indolent and devastating com-
munist rule that have brought Poland to 
economic collapse. The strikes called by Sol-
idarity have resulted in the loss of one day’s 
work in sixteen months; mismanagement 
and lack of supplies have resulted in the loss 
of over twenty work days. 
We appeal to every democratic govern-
ment, and to all those who believe in the 
Polish people’s right to basic freedoms, to 
immediately halt all economic and other 
transactions with Poland, until every mem-
ber of Solidarity is freed.

Under the CDC’s Mask Requirement all per-
sons using public conveyances such as 
planes, trains, and buses must wear facial 
coverings while on the conveyance and at 
transportation hubs such as airports and bus 
stations. CDC did not submit a CRA report 
to Congress or the Comptroller General on 
the Mask Requirement. 
The Congressional Review Act (CRA) re-
quires that before a rule can take effect, an 
agency must submit the rule to both the 
House of Representatives and the Senate as 
well as the Comptroller General, and pro-
vides procedures for congressional review 
where Congress may disapprove of rules. We 
conclude that the Mask Requirement meets 
the definition of a rule for purposes of CRA 
and, therefore, is subject to CRA’s require-
ments for submission and congressional re-
view. With this decision, we are not taking a 
position on the policy of imposing a mask re-
quirement or what steps the agency or Con-
gress may take next; our decision only ad-
dresses CDC’s compliance with CRA’s proce-
dures for congressional review. 
DECISION 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), a component of the U.S. De-
partment of Health and Human Services 
(HHS), issued a document entitled Require-
ment for Persons to Wear Masks While on 
Conveyances and at Transportation Hubs, 86 
Fed. Reg. 8025 (Mask Requirement) that was 
published in the Federal Register on Feb-
ruary 3, 2021. Senator Rand Paul, M.D., sub-
sequently requested our legal decision as to 
whether the Mask Requirement is a rule for 
purposes of the Congressional Review Act 
(CRA). Letter from Senator Rand Paul, M.D., 
to Comptroller General (Aug. 9, 2021). For 
the reasons explained below, we conclude 
that it is. 
Our practice when rendering decisions is to 
contact the relevant agencies to obtain their 
legal views on the subject of the request.

BACKGROUND 
CDC Mask Requirement 
On January 31, 2020, in response to con-
firmed cases of Novel Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19), the Secretary of HHS de-
clared a public health emergency under the 
Public Health Service Act. The Secretary 
has renewed that declaration, most recently 
on October 15, 2021. Subsequently, the Presi-
dent declared that the COVID–19 outbreak 
constitutes a national emergency under the 
National Emergencies Act. Proclamation No. 
9994, 85 Fed. Reg. 15,337 (Mar. 18, 2020). The 
national emergency declaration was contin-
ued on February 24, 2021. 86 Fed. Reg. 11,599 
(Feb. 26, 2021). 
On January 29, 2021, CDC issued the Mask 
Requirement pursuant to its regulatory au-
thorities under the Public Service Health 
Act with an effective date of February 1, 
2021. Mask Requirement, at 8025–26. It was 
published in the Federal Register on Feb-
ruary 3, 3021. 
The Mask Requirement states that masks 
help prevent the spread of COVID–19. Mask 
Requirement at 8028. The stated intent of the 
Mask Requirement is to preserve human life; 
maintain a safe and secure operating trans-
portation system; mitigate further introduc-
tion, transmission, and spread of COVID–19 
into and within the United States; and sup-
port response efforts. Id. at 8027 (statement 
of intent). 
Under the Mask Requirement, a person 
must wear a mask while boarding, dis-
embarking, and traveling on any conveyance 
(such as an aircraft, train, road vehicle, or 
vessel) into or within the United States. Id. 
at 8026, 8029. A person also must wear a mask 
while at a transportation hub (such as an 
airport, bus terminal, port, or subway sta-
tion) that provides transportation within the 
United States. Id. It also requires convey-
ance operators to only provide service to 
masked passengers and to use best efforts to 
ensure passengers stay masked during the 
entire trip. Id at 8029. 
The Mask Requirement provides several 
exemptions based on the characteristics of a 
passenger or the travel scenario. Id. at 8027– 
28. For instance, passengers under the age of 
two are exempt, as is travel by private con-
veyance for personal, noncommercial use. Id. 
at 8027, 8029. Other federal agencies are re-
quired to take additional steps to enforce the 
Mask Requirement. Id. at 8028, 8030. The 
Mask Requirement will remain in effect 
until rescinded by CDC or the public health 
emergency is ended by the Secretary of HHS. 
Id. at 8026. 
Congressional Review Act 
CRA, enacted in 1996 to strengthen con-
gressional oversight of agency rulemaking, 
requires federal agencies to submit a report 
on each new rule to both Houses of Congress 
and to the Comptroller General for review 
before a rule can take effect. 5 U.S.C. 801 
(a)(1)(A). The report must contain a copy of 
the rule, ‘‘a concise general statement relat-
ing to the rule,’’ and the rule’s proposed ef-
fective date. Id. Each House of Congress is to 
provide the report on the rule to the chair-
man and ranking member of each standing 
committee with jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. 801 
(a)(1)(C). The CRA allows Congress to review 
and disapprove rules issued by federal agen-
cies for a period of 60 days using special pro-
cedures. 5 U.S.C. 802. If a resolution of dis-
approval is enacted, then the new rule has no 
force or effect. Id. 
CRA adopts the definition of rule under the 
Administrative 
Procedure 
Act 
(APA), 
5 
U.S.C. §§ 551(4), which states that a rule is 
‘‘the whole or a part of an agency statement 
of general or particular applicability and fu-
ture effect designed to implement, interpret, 
or prescribe law or policy or describing the 
organization, procedure, or practice require-
ments of an agency.’’ 5 U.S.C. 804(3). CRA ex-
cludes three categories of rules from cov-
erage: (1) rules of particular applicability; (2) 
rules relating to agency management or per-
sonnel; and (3) rules of agency organization, 
procedure, or practice that do not substan-
tially affect the rights or obligations of non- 
agency parties. Id. 
CDC did not submit a CRA report to Con-
gress or the Comptroller General on the 
Mask Requirement. In its response to us, 
CDC stated the Mask Requirement was not 
subject to the CRA because it was an emer-
gency action under CDC’s regulatory au-
thorities and that any delays could result in 
serious harms. Response Letter, at 1. 
DISCUSSION 
The issue here is whether the CDC Mask 
Requirement is a rule under CRA. Applying 
the statutory framework of CRA, we first ad-
dress whether the Mask Requirement meets 
the definition of a rule under APA. We con-
clude that it does. Second, we address wheth-
er any of the CRA exceptions apply. We con-
clude they do not. Therefore, we conclude 
the Mask Requirement is a rule for purposes 
of CRA. 
CDC considers the Mask Requirement to be 
an order issued under its regulatory authori-
ties implementing the Public Health Service 
Act. See Response Letter, at 1–2 (‘‘[t]he 
mask order is an emergency action taken 
under 42 C.F.R. §§ 70.2, 71.31 (b), and 71.32 (b) 
. . . implementing regulations of 42 U.S.C. 
§ 264’’). Although an agency’s characteriza-
tion should be considered in deciding wheth-
er its action is a rule under the APA defini-
tion (and whether, for example, it is subject 
to notice and comment rulemaking require-
ments), ‘‘[an] agency’s own label . . . [is] not 
dispositive.’’ Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. 
v. OSHA, 636 F.2d 464,468 (D.C. Cir. 1980); B– 
329272, Oct. 19, 2017. 
The APA defines a rule as ‘‘the whole or a 
part of an agency statement of general or 
particular applicability and future effect de-
signed to implement, interpret, or prescribe 
law or policy or describing the organization, 
procedure, or practice requirements of an 
agency. . . .’’ 5 U.S.C. § 551(4). By contrast, 
the APA defines an order to be ‘‘the whole or 
a part of a final disposition, whether affirma-
tive, negative, injunctive, or declaratory in 
form, of an agency in a matter other than 
rule making but including licensing.’’ 5 
U.S.C. § 551(6). As we have noted in our prior 
decisions, these two definitions make rules 
and orders mutually exclusive categories. See 
B–332233, Aug. 13, 2020, at 3. 
Here the Mask Requirement meets the 
APA definition of a rule rather than an 
order. Regarding the first element of a rule, 
the Mask Requirement is an agency state-
ment because it is an official document pub-
lished in the Federal Register by CDC. Mask 
Requirement at 8025–26. It is of future effect, 
satisfying the second element, because the 
order states that it remains in place until re-
scinded or the public health emergency is 
terminated. Id. at 8026. Third, it implements 
and prescribes law or policy as it requires all 
travelers to wear a mask where previously 
they were not required to do so. Id. at 8028– 
29. Thus, the Mask Requirement falls within 
the APA’s definition of rule. 
Conversely, despite its label, the Mask Re-
quirement is not an order for purposes of the 
APA because it is not the result of an adju-
dicatory process. See Coalition for Common 
Sense in Gov’t Procurement v. Sec’y for Vet-
erans Affairs, 464 F.3d 1306, 1316–17 (Fed. Cir. 
2006). As noted previously, an order is defined 
as ‘‘the whole or a part of a final disposition, 
whether affirmative, negative, injunctive, or 
declaratory in form.’’ 5 U.S.C. § 551(6). Thus, 
an order results from an adjudicatory proc-
ess. See Coalition for Common Sense in Gov’t 
Procurement, 463 F.3d at 1316–17. Here, the 
Mask Requirement was not the result of an 
adjudicatory process but a prospective re-
quirement setting process. In its response to 
us, CDC described its process for drafting the 
Mask Requirement. ‘‘[It] was drafted and 
cleared by the CDC program (Division of 
Global Migration and Quarantine), Center 
(National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic 
Infectious Diseases), and CDC’s Office of the 
Director before it was provided to HHS for 
Departmental review. Following HHS review 
and clearance, it was provided to OMB.’’ Re-
sponse Letter at 2. This is a process used to 
draft rules, not an adjudicatory proceeding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9208 
December 15, 2021 
In support of its position that the agency 
action here is an order not a rule, CDC as-
serted that its long-standing regulations per-
mit it to act quickly to prevent the spread of 
communicable diseases and any delay in 
issuance of the Mask Requirement ‘‘could re-
sult in serious harm.’’ Response Letter, at 1. 
CDC further stated that the order was an 
emergency action and requiring the order to 
go through notice and comment before tak-
ing effect ‘‘would exacerbate the substantial 
harm that the order was intended to miti-
gate.’’ Id. 
While CRA does not provide an emergency 
exception from its procedural requirements 
to submit rules for congressional review, 
CRA and APA address an agency’s need to 
take emergency action without delay. Agen-
cies can waive the required delay in effective 
date requirement when an agency for ‘‘good 
cause’’ finds (and incorporates the finding 
and a brief statement of reasons in the rule 
issued) that notice and public procedure are 
‘‘impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to 
the public interest.’’ 5 U.S.C §§ 553(b), 808(2). 
Therefore, an agency can provide for a rule 
to take effect immediately while still com-
plying with the agency’s statutory obliga-
tion to submit the rule to Congress for re-
view. 
Having determined the Mask Requirement 
meets the definition of a rule, we must deter-
mine if any of the CRA exceptions apply. We 
conclude they do not. First, it is not a rule 
of particular applicability as it applies to all 
travelers using public conveyances and is not 
limited to specific parties. Mask Require-
ment, at 8028–29. Second, it does not deal 
with agency management or personnel but 
with travelers and conveyance operators. Id. 
at 8026. Finally, it is not a rule of agency or-
ganization, procedure, or practice that does 
not substantially affect the rights or obliga-
tions of non-agency parties as it imposes new 
requirements on people who are traveling to 
wear masks while in transit and at transpor-
tation hubs. Id. at 8028–29. It also requires 
operators to only provide service to masked 
passengers. Id. Thus, no exception applies. 
CONCLUSION 
The Mask Requirement is a rule for pur-
poses of CRA because it meets the APA defi-
nition of a rule and no CRA exception ap-
plies. Accordingly, before it can take effect, 
the Mask Requirement is subject to the re-
quirement that it be submitted to both 
Houses of Congress and the Comptroller Gen-
eral for review, which provides Congress a 
period of 60 days in which it may disapprove 
the rule using special procedures in accord-
ance with the CRA. While CDC asserted the 
need to act quickly as its justification for 
not submitting the Mask Requirement for 
congressional review, there is not an emer-
gency exception under CRA. An agency may, 
however, invoke the CRA’s good cause excep-
tion and provide for a rule to take effect im-
mediately while still complying with the 
agency’s statutory obligation to submit the 
rule to Congress for review. With this deci-
sion, we are not taking a position on the pol-
icy of imposing a mask requirement or what 
steps the agency or Congress may take next; 
our decision only addresses CDC’s compli-
ance with CRA’s procedures for congres-
sional review.

RECOGNIZING THE COAST GUARD 
PAY AND PERSONNEL CENTER 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize the 40th anni-
versary of the U.S. Coast Guard Pay 
and Personnel Center in Topeka, KS. 
The Pay and Personnel Center was first 
established in 1979 in the suburb area of 
Washington, DC. In 1982, with the help 
of Senator Bob Dole, the center perma-
nently moved to the Frank Carlson 
Federal Building in Topeka. It is a true 
honor that I and my staff have the 
pleasure of working with this devoted 
lineup of leaders on a routine basis. 
The Pay and Personnel Center offers 
a focused and essential service to more 
than 142,000 men and women of the U.S. 
Coast Guard. Their mission is to pro-
vide caring and responsive personnel 
and compensation services for each of 
their military members, retirees, annu-
itants, and other customers in support 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity missions. The Pay and Personnel 
Center has continued to operate with 
superb attention to detail without 
much attention publicly. They carry 
out the passionate mission of providing 
the compensation and services nec-
essary to keep our Coast Guard fo-
cused, secure, and dedicated. These 
men and women truly go above and be-
yond to help our Coast Guard members. 
I offer congratulations and accolades 
to the Pay and Personnel Center on 40 
years of hard work and superior service 
to our men and women in the U.S. 
Coast Guard. The center is an illus-
trious example of the Coast Guard 
motto, Semper Paratus, Always Ready. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing this milestone. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE 117TH ARW OF 
THE ALABAMA NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
today I rise to highlight the 100th anni-
versary of the 117th Air Refueling Wing 
based in Birmingham, AL, and to honor 
the patriotic men and women, past and 
present, of this storied National Guard 
unit. For a century, the 117th has de-
fended 
our 
freedoms 
by 
providing 
worldwide air refueling, airlift, logis-
tics, intelligence, and medical services. 
It is a profound honor to represent 
these great Americans in their nation’s 
capital. 
The United States hosts the world’s 
most powerful Air Force, which gives 
our country the ability to project 
strength and defend freedom around 
the globe. This capability is made pos-
sible by a heavy reliance on our air re-
fueling tankers that create bridges 
across the sky for our fighters and 
bombers. Since October 1994, the 117th 
Air Refueling Wing has proudly and ef-
fectively performed this critical air re-
fueling 
mission 
with 
the 
KC–135 
Stratotanker, a mainstay of our tanker 
fleet. 
The 117th Air Refueling Wing is heav-
ily utilized and often deployed. Their 
reliability and dedication has led them 
to take part in some of the most con-
sequential military actions of our 
time. 
During the Kosovo conflict of 1999, 
the wing flew operational missions 
over the Balkans following its deploy-
ment of six KC–135 aircraft to Brize- 
Norton Royal Air Force Base, England, 
in support of Operation Allied Force. 
After the horrific terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001, the 117th deployed 
to MacDill Air Force Base, FL, as part 
of Operation Noble Eagle to refuel F–15 
and F–16 aircraft that were flying 
around-the-clock protective combat air 
patrol missions over major cities in the 
United States. 
The wing deployed KC–135 aircraft to 
Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to fly oper-
ational missions in support of Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom and later 
played a key role in Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. Each of these deployments 
supported and directly contributed to 
the success of our air operations, keep-
ing Americans in the air and on the 
ground safer while imposing our will on 
the enemy. 
But, even decades before taking on 
the air refueling mission, the wing had 
a storied beginning and a long history 
of service to our country. 
In 1918, Major James A. Meissner, a 
World War I flying ace, returned home 
to Birmingham to lead the formation 
of a flying unit based at Roberts Field. 
As a result of his efforts, on January 
21, 1922, the U.S. Department of War 
identified the Birmingham Aero Club 
as the first Air National Guard Unit in 
Alabama. 
The unit was originally designated as 
the 135th Observation Squadron, Ala-
bama National Guard, and received 
Federal recognition as a Corps Avia-
tion unit. The flying squadron was 
nicknamed 
the 
‘‘Birmingham 
Escadrille’s,’’ 
and 
Major 
Meissner 
served as the first commander. 
On January 30, 1944, the unit, by then 
redesignated to the 106th Reconnais-
sance Squadron, flew its first combat 
sorties 
in 
B–25 
Mitchell 
aircraft 
against the Japanese from Sterling Is-
land in the South Pacific. 
In 1961, the unit was federalized in 
support of the Berlin Crisis. For 10 
months, 20 RF–84F Thunderstreak air-
craft flew missions from Dreux Air 
Base, France. 
Also in 1961, roughly 80 members of 
the Alabama Air National Guard se-
cretly took part in the operation to 
support the Bay of Pigs invasion of 
Cuba. These individuals bravely de-
fended the U.S. and Cuban people 
against the communist regime and 
were sworn to secrecy until the declas-
sification of the mission in 1998. 
In November 1971, the unit was se-
lected to be the first Air National 
Guard unit to receive the RF–4C Phan-
tom II aircraft, redesignated as the 
117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 
and assigned to the U.S. Air Force’s 
Tactical Air Command. 
Following Saddam Hussein’s August 
1990 invasion of Kuwait and the subse-
quent U.S. military buildup in the Mid-
dle East, six Alabama National Guard 
RF–4C aircraft equipped with special 
long-range cameras deployed on Au-
gust 24, 1990, to Al Dhafra Air Base, 
United Arab Emirates. Their mission 
was to obtain high-resolution images of

objects 100 miles away to aid prewar 
surveillance and photo-reconnaissance 
mapping of Iraqi forces in occupied Ku-
wait and along the Saudi Arabia-Iraq 
border. 
Though the missions and the aircraft 
have changed over the 100-year history 
of the flying squadron, one thing has 
remained 
constant: 
The 
men 
and 
women of the 117th have always an-
swered the call to service. That tradi-
tion has been proudly carried on by the 
nearly 1,000 men and women who com-
prise the 117th Air Refueling Wing. 
Today, we honor the airmen and 
women, maintainers, medical crews, 
and support staff of the 117th Air Re-
fueling Wing on this important anni-
versary and remember those that have 
given their lives as part of the wing’s 
operations. I salute them for their sac-
rifice and service to the great State of 
Alabama and the United States of 
America.

promote 
career 
awareness in accounting as part of a 
well-rounded STEM educational experi-
ence; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the STEM Education in 
Accounting Act with my colleague 
Senator ROSEN. Our bill would recog-
nize accounting as part of a well-round-
ed STEM education and allow school 
districts to use their Federal education

block grant resources to develop and 
improve instruction in accounting. It 
also aims to introduce more students 
to accounting and improve career 
awareness and workforce diversity in 
the field. In today’s rapidly changing 
world, improving students’ access to a 
STEM-based curriculum is increasingly 
vital to ensure they are prepared to 
succeed in the 21st-century workforce. 
Mathematics—the ‘‘M’’ in ‘‘STEM’’— 
is a critical skill that can help stu-
dents unlock countless doors to high- 
paying, in-demand fields. One of those 
doors leads to the accounting profes-
sion, whose work has a direct impact 
on employers, employees, retirees, in-
vestors, and the global economy. Cer-
tified 
professional 
accountants, 
or 
CPAs, play a key role in providing cap-
ital markets with confidence in finan-
cial reporting. Modern accounting in-
creasingly requires cutting-edge math 
and technology skills, including IT au-
diting, artificial intelligence, data ana-
lytics, and cyber security, to keep up 
with the market’s needs. 
Under the Every Student Succeeds 
Act, which is current law, school dis-
tricts may use funds from the Student 
Support and Academic Enrichment 
Program to support a host of cur-
ricular and extracurricular activities 
that deliver a well-rounded education 
to students in all grade levels. Specifi-
cally, the STEM Education in Account-
ing Act would add ‘‘activities to pro-
mote the development, implementa-
tion, and strengthening of programs to 
teach accounting’’ to the list of courses 
and activities supported by this flexi-
ble block grant. Our bill would also 
promote high-quality accounting in-
struction for members of groups under-
represented in the accounting profes-
sion. 
Encouraging a robust pipeline of fu-
ture accounting professionals is para-
mount. I encourage my colleagues to 
join us in supporting this bill to pro-
mote accounting education, improve 
students’ finance skills, and strengthen 
the pipeline of future accountants, who 
play such a vital role in our financial 
system.

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 4894. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. 
MARKEY) proposed an amendment to 
the bill S. 1404, to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the 23d Head-
quarters Special Troops and the 3133d 
Signal Service Company, popularly 
known as the ‘Ghost Army’, in recogni-
tion of their unique and highly distin-
guished service in conducting decep-
tion operations in Europe during World 
War II; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Ghost Army 
Congressional Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
(comprised of the 23d Headquarters and 
Headquarters Company, Special Troops, the 
603d Engineer Camouflage Battalion, the 
406th Combat Engineer Company, the 3132d 
Signal Service Company, and the Signal 
Company, Special, 23d Headquarters, Special 
Troops) and the 3133d Signal Service Com-
pany were units of the United States Army 
that served in Europe during World War II; 
(2) the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
was actively engaged in battlefield oper-
ations from June of 1944 through March of 
1945; 
(3) the 3133d Signal Service Company was 
engaged in operations in Italy in 1945; 
(4) the deceptive activities of these units 
were integral to several Allied victories 
across Europe and reduced casualties; 
(5) in evaluating the performance of these 
units after World War II, an Army analysis 
found that ‘‘Rarely, if ever, has there been a 
group of such a few men which had so great 
an influence on the outcome of a major mili-
tary campaign.’’; 
(6) many Ghost Army soldiers were citizen- 
soldiers recruited from art schools, adver-
tising agencies, communications companies, 
and other creative and technical professions; 
(7) the first 4 members of the 23d Head-
quarters Special Troops landed on D-Day and 
2 became casualties while creating false 
beach landing sites; 
(8) a detachment of Army radio operators 
under the command of Lieutenant Fred Fox 
joined the invasion fleet for a planned decep-
tion, Operation Troutfly, which was can-
celled; 
(9) Lieutenant Fox’s men and their radios 
were instead attached to the 82d Airborne, 
which had lost 95 percent of its radio equip-
ment, providing critical communications as 
the 82d Airborne fought its way inland; 
(10) the secret deception operations of the 
23d Headquarters Special Troops commenced 
in France on June 14, 1944, when Task Force 
Mason, a 16-man detachment of the 23d led 
by First Lieutenant Bernard Mason, arrived 
in Normandy; 
(11) Lieutenant Mason and his men set up 
dummy artillery to draw enemy fire and pro-
tect the 980th Field Artillery Battalion (VIII 
Corps) as part of the Normandy Campaign; 
(12) the rest of the soldiers of the 23d Head-
quarters Special Troops arrived in France in 
July and August of 1944; 
(13) full-scale deception efforts began with 
Operation Elephant from July 1 to 4, 1944, in 
which the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
covered the movement of the 2d Armored Di-
vision when it left a reserve position to go 
into the line between the First United States 
and Second British Armies; 
(14) Operation Elephant was the first of the 
21 full-scale tactical deceptions completed by 
the 23d Headquarters Special Troops; 
(15) often operating on or near the front 
lines, the 23d Headquarters Special Troops 
used inflatable tanks, artillery, airplanes 
and other vehicles, advanced engineered 
soundtracks, and skillfully crafted radio 
trickery to create the illusion of sizable 
American forces where there were none and 
to draw the enemy away from Allied troops; 
(16) the 3132d and the 3133d Signal Service 
Companies, activated in Pine Camp (now 
Fort Drum), New York, at the Army Experi-
mental Station in March and June of 1944, 
respectively, were the only ‘‘sonic decep-
tion’’ ground combat units of the United 
States in World War II; 
(17) soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops impersonated other, larger Army 
units by sewing counterfeit patches onto 
their uniforms, painting false markings on 
their vehicles, and creating phony head-
quarters staffed by fake generals, all in an 
effort to feed false information to Axis spies; 
(18) during the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d 
Headquarters Special Troops created coun-
terfeit radio traffic in an effort to deceive 
the enemy of the movement of elements of 
General George S. Patton’s Third Army as it 
shifted to break through to the 101st Air-
borne Division and elements of 10th Armored 
Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bas-
togne; 
(19) in its final mission, Operation Viersen, 
in March 1945, the 23d Headquarters Special 
Troops conducted a tactical deception oper-
ation intended to draw German units down 
the Rhine River and away from the Ninth 
Army, allowing the Ninth Army to cross the 
Rhine into Germany; 
(20) during Operation Viersen, the 23d 
Headquarters Special Troops, with the as-
sistance of other units, impersonated 2 com-
plete divisions of American forces by using 
fabricated radio networks, soundtracks of 
construction work and artillery fire, and 
hundreds of inflatable and real vehicles; 
(21) according to a military intelligence of-
ficer of the 79th Infantry, ‘‘There is no doubt 
that Operation Viersen materially assisted 
in deceiving the enemy with regard to the 
real dispositions and intentions of this 
Army.’’; 
(22) 3 soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops gave their lives and dozens were 
injured in carrying out their mission; 
(23) in April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service 
Company conducted Operation Craftsman in 
support of Operation Second Wind, the suc-
cessful Allied effort to break through the 
German defensive position to the north of 
Florence, Italy, known as the Gothic Line; 
(24) along with an attached platoon of Brit-
ish engineers, who were inflatable decoy spe-
cialists, the 3133d Signal Service Company 
used sonic deception to misrepresent troop 
locations along this defensive line; 
(25) the activities of the 23d Headquarters 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company remained highly classified for 
more than 40 years after the war and re-
ceived minimal recognition; 
(26) the extraordinary accomplishments of 
this unit are deserving of belated official rec-
ognition; and 
(27) the United States is eternally grateful 
to the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company for their proficient use of innova-
tive tactics during World War II, which saved 
lives and made significant contributions to 
the defeat of the Axis powers. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.

Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives shall make ap-

mental Station in March and June of 1944, 
respectively, were the only ‘‘sonic decep-
tion’’ ground combat units of the United 
States in World War II; 
(17) soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops impersonated other, larger Army 
units by sewing counterfeit patches onto 
their uniforms, painting false markings on 
their vehicles, and creating phony head-
quarters staffed by fake generals, all in an 
effort to feed false information to Axis spies; 
(18) during the Battle of the Bulge, the 23d 
Headquarters Special Troops created coun-
terfeit radio traffic in an effort to deceive 
the enemy of the movement of elements of 
General George S. Patton’s Third Army as it 
shifted to break through to the 101st Air-
borne Division and elements of 10th Armored 
Division in the besieged Belgian town of Bas-
togne; 
(19) in its final mission, Operation Viersen, 
in March 1945, the 23d Headquarters Special 
Troops conducted a tactical deception oper-
ation intended to draw German units down 
the Rhine River and away from the Ninth 
Army, allowing the Ninth Army to cross the 
Rhine into Germany; 
(20) during Operation Viersen, the 23d 
Headquarters Special Troops, with the as-
sistance of other units, impersonated 2 com-
plete divisions of American forces by using 
fabricated radio networks, soundtracks of 
construction work and artillery fire, and 
hundreds of inflatable and real vehicles; 
(21) according to a military intelligence of-
ficer of the 79th Infantry, ‘‘There is no doubt 
that Operation Viersen materially assisted 
in deceiving the enemy with regard to the 
real dispositions and intentions of this 
Army.’’; 
(22) 3 soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops gave their lives and dozens were 
injured in carrying out their mission; 
(23) in April 1945, the 3133d Signal Service 
Company conducted Operation Craftsman in 
support of Operation Second Wind, the suc-
cessful Allied effort to break through the 
German defensive position to the north of 
Florence, Italy, known as the Gothic Line; 
(24) along with an attached platoon of Brit-
ish engineers, who were inflatable decoy spe-
cialists, the 3133d Signal Service Company 
used sonic deception to misrepresent troop 
locations along this defensive line; 
(25) the activities of the 23d Headquarters 
Special Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company remained highly classified for 
more than 40 years after the war and re-
ceived minimal recognition; 
(26) the extraordinary accomplishments of 
this unit are deserving of belated official rec-
ognition; and 
(27) the United States is eternally grateful 
to the soldiers of the 23d Headquarters Spe-
cial Troops and the 3133d Signal Service 
Company for their proficient use of innova-
tive tactics during World War II, which saved 
lives and made significant contributions to 
the defeat of the Axis powers.
