PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Eternal God, bless us with Your 
abundance this day. All that we seek 
may we receive. Then may we see that 
You alone have provided for us. 
We dedicate the work of our hands 
and our minds to Your purpose. Allow 
us all that we need, for in You we have 
the plenitude of Your abundant grace. 
When we are uncertain that we have 
enough time, energy, or information to 
carry out our responsibilities to our 
country, our communities, or our fami-
lies, remind us that You are able to 
bless us beyond our limited human vi-
sion, and provide for us when we fall 
short. 
Remind us also that more than just 
the work that we do or the daily lives 
that we lead, You offer to us the 
wealth of spiritual prosperity available 
in You. May we draw from Your spirit 
the resources we need to face the pro-
found challenges and meet the profane 
contests that seek to undermine our 
integrity and rob us of hope. 
In all things, O God, may we call 
upon You and the mercy You desire to 
lavish upon us. In this may we find life 
and have it more abundantly. 
In Your generous name we pray. 
Amen.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL 
MICHAEL PAREDES AND OFFI-
CER JOSEPH SANTANA 
(Mrs. NAPOLITANO asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to two El 
Monte police officers, Corporal Michael 
Paredes and Officer Joseph Santana, 
killed in the line of duty on Tuesday 
night. The two officers were fatally in-
jured while investigating a domestic 
violence call. 
Corporal Paredes started his career 
with the El Monte Police Department 
as a full-time officer in July 2000. Prior 
to being appointed corporal, he worked 
on specialized assignments. Corporal 
Paredes is survived by his wife, daugh-
ter, and son. 
Officer Santana began his law en-
forcement 
career 
with 
the 
San 
Bernardino County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment as a deputy sheriff. After 3 years, 
he accepted a position as a police offi-
cer in the city of El Monte, allowing 
Santana to serve his hometown. He is 
survived by his wife, daughter, and 
twin boys. 
Our hearts are filled with deep sad-
ness today as we mourn the loss of 
these brave officers who paid the ulti-
mate sacrifice while protecting our 
community. 
Their 
dedication 
will 
never be forgotten. 
Our heartfelt prayers and condo-
lences go out to the officers’ families 
and all of the friends and loved ones in 
the El Monte community. 
f 
ROLL BACK REGULATIONS TO 
PREVENT FAMINE 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, ever 
since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
world leaders have been warning of im-
minent food shortages, including our 
own President. 
Two of the largest producers of wheat 
and oilseed are embroiled at war. 
Ukrainian civilians are fighting to pro-
tect their homes and their self-sov-
ereignty. They aren’t out planting 
crops as normal. 
Meanwhile, there are breaking re-
ports 
of 
Russian 
soldiers 
stealing 
Ukrainian wheat, selling it at marked- 
up costs to nations facing food insecu-
rity in Africa. 
Meanwhile, the Russian Navy has 
blocked grain carriers from leaving 
Ukraine’s Black Sea port of Odessa in 
an effort to blackmail the world into 
supporting Putin’s war.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5614 
June 16, 2022 
The U.N. is trying to broker a deal 
that will enable Ukraine’s grain to be 
shipped from ports such as Odessa, but 
Russia has said it wants Western sanc-
tions lifted as part of the deal. Twenty 
million tons of Ukrainian grain is 
stuck in Ukraine, at risk of being sto-
len by Russians. 
What are we doing in this country? 
We are not producing the way we could 
in California. Waters are being shifted 
away from farmers, and so our own 
wheat crops in northern California are 
dying out. 
The Biden administration must roll 
back the regulations that are making 
it hard for farmers in this country to 
do what they need to do to be a part of 
this world solution for food, as famine 
will soon be upon us, especially in the 
2023 crop year.

TRAGEDY IN POTTSTOWN 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, on Thurs-
day, May 26, an explosion erupted in 
the tight-knit community of Potts-
town, Pennsylvania, destroying two 
homes and, tragically, killing five peo-
ple, a grandmother and four of her 
grandchildren, and also seriously injur-
ing their parents. 
Today, I want to remember Francine 
White, 67, and her grandchildren, Alana 
Wood, 13, Jeremiah White, 12, Nehe-
miah White, 10, Tristan White, 8. 
It is hard to paint a picture with 
words of the devastation of a home, the 
people who lived there and dreamed in 
it, reduced to rubble, a family gone, 
suddenly. 
Now, there is a deep hole in Hale 
Street, and a huge hole is left in the 
hearts of their neighbors. They have 
made a vigil on their block and spent 
countless hours trying to make sense 
of the tragedy. 
Pottstown, I know you have always 
been a strong community. You are 
Pottstown Strong. Know that I will be 
with you, with your neighbors, as we 
figure out how this happened to be sure 
it never happens again. 
My prayers are with the family and 
the entire community of Pottstown. 
May their memories be a blessing. 
f 
AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE PAYING 
FOR PRESIDENT’S MISTAKES 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
the biggest challenge facing Missouri 
families right now is sky-high infla-
tion. They know that President Biden 
and Washington Democrats have only 
themselves to blame for driving infla-
tion to the highest level in 40 years. 
Last month alone, inflation cost Mis-
souri families an extra $663. That is 
about the same as a monthly payment 
on a brand-new pickup truck. 
Gas prices are the highest they have 
been, at over $5 a gallon. The cost to 
fill up an F–150 is over $150. 
Families are paying more to put food 
on their tables, clothes on their backs, 
and gasoline in their cars. Milk is up 15 
percent. Bread is up 14 percent. Bacon 
is up 18 percent. 
Just yesterday, the Federal Reserve 
raised interest rates for the third time 
since March. This is yet another price 
increase for families, farmers, and 
small businesses. 
The American people cannot afford 
to keep paying for President Biden’s 
mistakes. 
f 
RECOGNIZING CONTRIBUTIONS 
MADE BY DREAMERS 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 10-year an-
niversary of the Deferred Action for 
Childhood 
Arrivals 
program, 
more 
commonly known as DACA. 
Ten years ago, President Obama and 
Democrats reaffirmed America’s tradi-
tion as the land of opportunity by cre-
ating DACA. Since that day, brave 
young immigrants, known as Dream-
ers, have provided massive contribu-
tions on their path to the American 
Dream. 
DACA gave Dreamers a chance to do 
that, to dream big. It allowed them to 
use their talents, giving them a chance 
to seek higher education, work, and, 
most importantly, protection from de-
portation. They were there for us on 
the front lines, working as healthcare 
workers, all kinds of workers, to help 
us through the pandemic, and we thank 
them. 
While we celebrate DACA as a signifi-
cant temporary achievement for all of 
America, it is by no means a substitute 
for fixing our broken immigration sys-
tem. 
Mr. Speaker, I promise to continue 
our fight for comprehensive immigra-
tion reform so that we can finally keep 
families together permanently. 
f 
CELEBRATING DREAMERS ON 
DACA’S 10TH ANNIVERSARY 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, as chair of 
the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I 
rise today to call for immediate action 
to protect our Nation’s Dreamers. 
Yesterday, we marked the 10th anni-
versary of the DACA program with a 
relentless focus on our goal to provide 
a pathway to citizenship for our Na-
tion’s Dreamers. 
Over the last 5 years, we have seen 
persistent attacks on DACA, and the 
need to act could not be more urgent. 
You see, DACA has been a rocket 
booster for our economy. In my district 
alone, Dreamers contribute nearly $300 
million in GDP. They are doctors, law-
yers, 
essential 
workers, 
engineers, 
businessowners, and job creators. They 
make America stronger, and they 
shouldn’t have to live in fear of depor-
tation. 
I call on 10 Republican Senators to do 
what is right: Support the House- 
passed bipartisan Dream and Promise 
Act, pass it in the Senate, and bring 
humanity back to our immigration 
system and restore American values. 
To all the Dreamers who are watch-
ing, know that I celebrate you. I stand 
with you, and fight for you. 
Estan en casa. You are home. Home 
is here. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PTSD 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
June 
as 
National 
Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder Awareness Month. Dur-
ing the month of June, we raise aware-
ness for those suffering from post-trau-
matic stress disorders. 
After a trauma or life-threatening 
event, it is common to have reactions 
such as upsetting memories, increased 
jumpiness, or trouble sleeping. If these 
reactions do not go away, or if they get 
worse, you might suffer from PTSD. 
PTSD is especially prevalent for 
those who have served in the military, 
affecting nearly 30 percent of Vietnam 
veterans and up to 20 percent of vet-
erans who served during the global war 
on terror. 
As a former rehabilitation specialist, 
I know firsthand the incredible strides 
individuals can make when they have 
access to appropriate rehabilitation. 
PTSD Awareness Month is not only 
an opportunity to raise awareness 
about PTSD; it is also an opportunity 
to raise awareness about treatment op-
tions. 
I applaud all the organizations that 
raise awareness about this important 
issue during June. There is help and 
support for those who have PTSD.

COMMEMORATING 
THE 
CENTEN-
NIAL OF JAMES JOYCE’S ‘‘ULYS-
SES’’ 
(Mr. NEAL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the centennial of 
James Joyce’s ‘‘Ulysses,’’ arguably one 
of the great literary accomplishments 
in history. The time-honored epic was 
published in its entirety on Joyce’s 
40th birthday, February 2, 1922. 
Born in Dublin and educated at Uni-
versity College Dublin, his words tran-
scend countries across the world. The

story is read and studied worldwide, 
and Joyce himself has become an in-
trinsic part of world culture. 
Through a stream of consciousness 
writing style, and with humor and par-
ody, Joyce has kept literary thinkers 
and historians engaged with inter-
preting his words, even 100 years later. 
In 265,222 words, Joyce chronicles the 
simple and even mundane encounters 
of protagonist Leopold Bloom on one 
ordinary day in Dublin: Thursday, June 
16, 1904. Yet, Joyce does it with such 
wit, linguistic exuberance, and high re-
gard for the ordinary and often over-
looked details that readers remain cap-
tivated. 
I am one of those readers. 
June 16, today, is considered by 
Joyce fans as Bloomsday, and festivals 
are taking place in Dublin, here in the 
States, and around the world. 
As such, let me wish all of you a 
happy Bloomsday.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill, 
as amended, shall be debatable for 1 
hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Agriculture or 
their respective designees. 
The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. 
DAVID SCOTT) and the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT). 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 7606, 
the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, 
and I encourage my colleagues to sup-
port this package that is comprised of 
multiple bills that our House Agri-
culture Committee has advanced in a 
strong, bipartisan manner. 
Mr. Speaker, as we all know, the last 
2 years have led to drastic fluctuations 
in prices. Whether you look at the on-
going impacts of the COVID–19 pan-
demic or the global disruptions associ-
ated with Putin’s war in Ukraine, 
American farmers, American ranchers, 
and consumers are, right now, facing 
terrible, increasing costs on the farm, 
at the grocery store, and at the gas sta-
tion. 
Our Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act 
tackles these price increases head on 
by increasing competition, options at 
the pump, and by providing needed sup-
port for America’s agriculture sector 
at every stop of our food supply chain. 
Mr. Speaker, our package includes 
four main pillars. 
One: Ensuring robust competition in 
the meat and poultry sector. 
Two: Lowering costs at the grocery 
store by lowering costs for our farmers 
and ranchers. 
Three: By empowering our farmers to 
help provide fuel choices and lower 
prices at our gas stations. 
Four: Strengthening the food supply 
chain. 
Going further into each of these pil-
lars, first, this package will establish 
an Office of the Special Investigator 
for Competition Matters in the Agri-
culture Secretary’s office. 
When we held a hearing, Mr. Speaker, 
it was a very powerful hearing. It was 
the largest viewing audience for a hear-
ing in the history of our Agriculture 
Committee. 
We 
heard 
overwhelming 
evidence 
that continuing the status quo when it 
comes to enforcement will not provide 
more desperately needed competition 
and fairness within our meat and poul-
try industries. 
So we believe earnestly that the 
USDA and their expertise in agri-
culture issues gives them a strong foot-
ing to investigate the competitiveness 
in our meat and poultry sectors and to 
enforce existing laws to ensure a fair 
playing field for our family farmers, 
ranchers, and consumers. 
Mr. Speaker, we were informed at 
that hearing that right now, we are los-
ing 17,000 ranching farms every year. 
This has to stop. 
Our bill also includes a bipartisan 
provision that will support the cre-
ation and expansion of processing ca-
pacity for small- and medium-sized 
producers to help alleviate this ter-
rible, threatening consolidation just to 
a handful of four meatpacking compa-
nies. This is the core of this legisla-
tion. 
Our second pillar addresses a key 
piece in the puzzle of rising prices. At 
the grocery store, there have been 
record increases in input costs for agri-
cultural 
producers, 
with 
fertilizer 
prices for both specialty and row crop 
producers skyrocketing. This bill will 
help reduce their input costs so plan-
ning decisions are not impacted. 
Mr. Speaker, speaking of fertilizer 
costs, it is very important for the Na-
tion to know that right now, Russia 
produces and controls 66 percent of the 
fertilizer in the world. This needs to 
have serious, serious attention. 
Our second pillar of this legislative 
package is the puzzle of rising prices. 
Our third pillar addresses fuel costs, 
which is something that impacts every-
one, whether you are paying more at 
the gas pump or seeing increasing 
prices in the grocery store from higher 
trucking and transportation costs. 
This package addresses these con-
cerns in a way that empowers our 
farmers and provides more choice and 
lower prices for our consumers at the 
gas pump and at the grocery store. 
Mr. Speaker, our biofuels adoption 
and investment helps reduce our reli-
ance on foreign oil and the supply 
shocks facing our gasoline supply, 
while also bolstering a revenue stream

June 16, 2022 
for our farmers and producers across 
the country. 
Bolstering our use of ethanol from 
E10 to E15 will not impact the environ-
ment, our Environmental Protection 
Agency confirms this, nor will it slow 
down the rollout of electric vehicles. 
This vital package of bills makes 
much-needed improvements in our sup-
ply chain. A series of shocks to our 
beef supply chain, combined with a 
concentrated processing infrastructure, 
resulted in high prices for meat at our 
grocery stores and lower prices for our 
producers, farmers, and ranchers. 
Specifically, one provision calls for 
the formation of an Agricultural and 
Food System Supply Chain Resilience 
and Crisis Response Task Force to ex-
amine our food supply chain and report 
back to us here in Congress on the 
strengths and the weaknesses that 
exist. 
I am extremely proud of the work of 
our 
House 
Agriculture 
Committee 
members, both Democrats and Repub-
licans, who have worked tirelessly to 
put this strong bipartisan bill together. 
We have garnered for this bill ex-
tremely important bipartisan partici-
pation. This is what our Nation is hun-
gry for; Democrats and Republicans 
working together to bring down these 
high costs for our food and our fuel. 
This bill is a bill that our American 
people want and deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I note that several of the sec-
tions in this bill codify or are complemen-
tary to ongoing and planned programs that 
the Department of Agriculture is carrying 
out or planning to carry out with existing 
authorities and funding. The intent behind 
passage of this bill is to be additive to those 
efforts and is in no way intended to limit or 
pause those programs and efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion to H.R. 7606 because, simply put, 
this bill does nothing in the immediate 
future to lower food and fuel costs. 
Long before Russia’s invasion of 
Ukraine, America’s farm families and 
consumers were struggling with frac-
tured 
supply 
chains, 
skyrocketing 
input costs, and historic levels of infla-
tion, each of which continue to con-
tribute to increased food prices and di-
minished inventories. 
Despite these crises, Democrats have 
neglected to take serious action to 
incentivize increased American produc-
tion. In fact, we are here today to de-
bate a bill that compounds the situa-
tion, further limiting American farm-
ers’ abilities to meet global food de-
mand and doubling down on the idea 
that more spending and big govern-
ment will feed the world. 
Adding insult to injury, the White 
House has been quick to blame the pri-
vate sector and alleged industry con-
centration for the current crisis. 
Economists across the spectrum—in-
cluding former Obama and Clinton ad-
ministration officials—have dismissed 
the strategy as misleading, at best, or 
otherwise, blatantly political. 
So it is not surprising that at the be-
hest of the White House, we are debat-
ing a package where the anchor piece 
of legislation perpetuates a tired nar-
rative of blame, duplicates existing au-
thorities, ignores industry and pro-
ducers, and undermines the Depart-
ment of Justice. 
It is also not surprising the party of 
defund the police also has become the 
party of more cops for cows. At every 
turn, this administration has obses-
sively pointed the finger at the packing 
industry, in particular, blaming them 
almost singlehandedly for rising food 
costs. 
They have done so via blog posts, 
contrived public events, and press 
briefings, all without any acknowledg-
ment of the culpability of their own 
reckless spending and heavy-handed 
regulatory agenda. 
My Democratic colleagues have duti-
fully played along, executing sensa-
tionalized hearings and political theat-
rics designed to support unvetted and 
controversial bills. 
Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder many of 
us question the seriousness of the bill 
before us today. If this were a serious 
exercise, my Democratic colleagues 
would not have paired such an egre-
gious example of legislative overreach 
with several other very thoughtful, 
very bipartisan bills. 
If this were a serious exercise, my 
Democrat colleagues would not have 
added two unvetted Democrat amend-
ments that are more about political 
point-scoring than genuine near-term 
policy solutions. 
If this were a serious exercise, my 
Democrat 
colleagues 
would 
have 
worked with Republicans to form a 
concrete, immediate policy solution 
with a chance of consideration in the 
Senate. 
Now, I know both parties understand 
the gravity of these issues. While we 
may have disagreements on policy, I 
was confident that we could find com-
mon-ground solutions, if given the op-
portunity. 
b 0930 
I am dumbfounded as to why Demo-
cratic leadership would choose this mo-
ment—when consumers are deciding 
between gas in their cars or food on 
their tables—as an attempt to score po-
litical points, especially on the heels of 
a nearly 9 percent increase in consumer 
prices, the worst this Nation has seen 
since the Carter administration. 
So, Republicans forged ahead, and we 
developed solutions. Earlier this week, 
Leader MCCARTHY and I, along with 
nearly 100 of our Republican col-
leagues, sent a letter to President 
Biden outlining administrative actions 
that he could take immediately to 
mitigate 
rising 
input 
costs, 
and 
strengthen the role that American ag-
riculture plays in global food stability. 
And yesterday, I, along with many of 
those same Members, introduced H.R. 
8069, the Reducing Farm Input Costs 
and Barriers to Domestic Production 
Act. This bill would reverse many of 
the more harmful regulatory burdens 
spearheaded by this administration, 
address escalating input costs, and pro-
vide certainty to farmers, ranchers, ag-
ribusinesses, and other entities across 
the food and agriculture supply chain. 
Specifically, the bill provides relief 
from EPA’s unprecedented actions re-
lated to pesticides and other vital crop 
protection tools; offers clarity related 
to WOTUS regulations; rescinds the 
SEC’s harmful proposed rule on cli-
mate-related 
disclosures; 
reinstates 
the 2020 NEPA streamlining; and re-
quires an economic analysis on the 
costs and the benefits of GIPSA rules. 
These are all actions which would pro-
vide immediate relief to our farm fami-
lies and households across the globe, 
and they all were rejected by the Rules 
Committee majority as amendments to 
the bill before us. 
The letter and this bill stand in stark 
contrast to what we have seen from the 
White House and the Democrats in 
Congress and their efforts to scapegoat 
private industry for skyrocketing gas 
prices and sustained supply chain fail-
ures. 
So, in short, the crises we are facing 
cannot and will not be mitigated with 
unfunded mandates, duplicative au-
thorities, politicized agencies, and Big 
Government, all of which are laced into 
H.R. 7606. 
I remain opposed to this bill and the 
process which got us here but stand 
willing to work with my colleagues on 
commonsense, near-term solutions to 
provide immediate relief to farmers, 
ranchers, foresters, and American con-
sumers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days in which to revise and extend 
their remarks and insert extraneous 
material on H.R. 7606. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Georgia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
SCHRIER), my good friend. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for the opportunity to 
speak on this important bill, the Lower 
Food and Fuel Costs Act. 
American families are struggling. 
They are continuing to see rising gas 
prices even as oil and gas companies 
are making record profits. 
Higher prices at the grocery store are 
making it harder to put food on the 
table, and a lot of this is because farm-
ers are struggling with increasing fuel 
prices. Costs and availability of trans-
portation to both domestic and export 
markets continue to be a challenge for 
the wheat, cherry, apple, and pear 
growers in my district.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5620 
June 16, 2022 
This is a global problem, but it is a 
problem that we can take steps to ease 
right here at home. This bill provides 
the resources to do just that. 
It addresses the cost of fuel by allow-
ing year-round sales of higher ethanol 
blends, which are consistently less ex-
pensive than higher octane gas. 
It addresses high food prices by help-
ing farmers and helping our supply 
chain. 
Fertilizer costs are at record highs 
since most of our fertilizer is typically 
sourced from Russia. This bill helps 
farmers spend less on inputs without 
lowering crop yields. 
We are paying skyrocketing prices 
for meat at the grocery store, but 
farmers and ranchers don’t see any of 
that additional profit because four 
companies control 80 percent of U.S. 
meat processing. That is unfair. 
This bill expands the availability and 
capacity of meat processing and will 
create new jobs, provide more options 
for small- and medium-sized ranching 
operations, and help lower the cost of 
meat at the grocery store. 
Finally, addressing the cost of truck-
ing and transportation will help farm-
ers get their crops to market. 
The whole goal here is to make life a 
little easier for the people we rep-
resent, to help you fill up your tank 
and feed your family. As the only mem-
ber on the House Agriculture Com-
mittee from the Northwest, I will con-
tinue to do all that I can to support 
farmers and lower costs for American 
families. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
distinguished gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. LUCAS), the former chair-
man of the full House Agriculture Com-
mittee, who continues to this day to be 
an incredible advocate for agriculture 
and a mentor of mine as I have worked 
my way into this leadership role. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in op-
position to H.R. 7606 because American 
farmers and ranchers deserve real as-
sistance, real relief, real policy solu-
tions. 
To understand my opposition, you 
must understand the part of the coun-
try that I represent and was raised in. 
The Third District of Oklahoma was 
the epicenter of the drought, the Dust 
Bowl, and the economic depression of 
the 1930s. This was a time when hor-
rible weather conditions collided with 
misguided Federal ag and misguided 
Federal monetary policy to create an 
environment that profoundly changed 
the region that my family has called 
home for over 120 years. 
I was raised on these stories, and it 
was their experiences that shaped my 
view on what the role of the Federal 
Government should be. The Federal 
Government should be passing and en-
acting policies that help people and 
businesses, not hinder them. Unfortu-
nately, the Biden administration and 
House Democrats seem to not hold that 
same view. 
During the past 5 years, American 
farmers and ranchers have weathered 
volatile world markets, devastating 
natural disasters, prolonged droughts, 
supply chain disruptions, ever-increas-
ing input costs, and soaring inflation. 
Yet, the only thing the Biden admin-
istration and House Democrats seem 
interested in doing is increasing regu-
latory burdens, limiting access to fuel, 
and passing spending packages that 
fuel inflation. 
Mr. Speaker, if House Democrats 
were truly interested in providing re-
lief for American farmers and ranchers, 
they would join my Republican col-
leagues and me in calling for the Biden 
administration to reinstate the Trump- 
era Waters of the United States rule 
and rescind the Biden administration’s 
WOTUS rule. 
If Democrats were interested in re-
ducing the cost of farm inputs like fer-
tilizer and fuel, they would work with 
us to restore and expand domestic en-
ergy production. They would join us in 
calling for the Biden administration to 
rescind the SEC’s proposed rule on cli-
mate-related disclosure. 
This rule is not only a ploy to divert 
capital away from traditional energy 
investments, it also requires farmers, 
regardless of size, to track and report 
environmental data to public compa-
nies with which they work. 
Finally, House Democrats are tout-
ing this bill as a solution to the issue 
of consolidation in the meatpacking in-
dustry. As we all know, DOJ—yes, the 
Department of Justice—is in the mid-
dle of an ongoing investigation into the 
meatpacking industry, an investiga-
tion that was launched under the 
Trump administration. 
I feel strongly that if there is collu-
sion, manipulation, or other wrong-
doing by packers, then the existing law 
should be enforced under the existing 
authorities at USDA and DOJ. There 
are civil and criminal penalties if vio-
lations are found. Changing those au-
thorities or laws in the middle of an 
ongoing investigation only helps to 
confuse and complicate the eventual 
DOJ findings. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this messaging bill and join 
with me in calling for real solutions for 
American farmers and ranchers. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the Lower Food and 
Fuel Costs Act. 
Across the country, workers are call-
ing out sick because of COVID, truck 
deliveries and other shipments are fac-
ing delays, and people are panic-buy-
ing, all leading to product shortages 
and soaring prices. 
Yet, while we know the COVID–19 
pandemic has undoubtedly challenged 
our Nation’s supply chain, we also 
know there are systemic imbalances in 
our economy. Decreased competition, 
driven by market concentration, has 
allowed companies to further drive up 
costs and their profits at the expense of 
hardworking Americans in one of our 
most vulnerable moments. 
In the beef-processing market, for ex-
ample, four dominant companies con-
trol 85 percent of the market. The four 
largest poultry processing companies 
made up more than half of the market 
in 2015, up from 35 percent of the mar-
ket in 1986. 
We have seen this trend all across 
our economy, as large corporations 
have squeezed out independent busi-
nesses, eliminating competition. As a 
result, 
hardworking 
Americans 
throughout this country are paying 
more as food prices skyrocket, particu-
larly for meat. 
Provisions included in the Lower 
Food and Fuel Costs Act will help us 
tackle this very issue and help bring 
prices down across the board. 
The Meat and Poultry Special Inves-
tigator Act and the Butcher Block Act, 
for example, will help strengthen our 
investigatory and enforcement tools to 
address 
market 
competition 
issues 
while also investing in additional meat 
processing capacity. 
The PRECISE Act will improve farm-
ing efficiency and help ensure farmers’ 
resiliency to future disruptions in fer-
tilizer supply. 
The Renewable Fuel Infrastructure 
Investment and Market Expansion Act 
and the Year-Round Fuel Choice Act 
will help drive down prices at the pump 
for Americans and increase available 
fuel supply. 
These are just a few of the provisions 
in this comprehensive package that 
will help ease the economic burden on 
American families and help create an 
economy that works for all of us. 
I urge my colleagues to come to-
gether to help hardworking Americans 
by driving down these costs and sup-
porting this legislation. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think we should see an 
extension, a little bigger of that poster 
that we saw there. That concentration 
occurred because of exactly what we 
are seeing today of government and 
Democrats leveling regulations. It was 
regulations that caused the concentra-
tion within the meatpacking industry. 
What happened when you put on more 
regulations, small- and medium-sized 
processors weren’t able to continue to 
work. They couldn’t cope with the 
compliance costs. They just couldn’t 
handle those increased regulations. 
Today, we are seeing not just addi-
tional regulations, but a whole new po-
lice officer being created under the poi-
son pill within this legislation, special 
investigator bill. 
I would argue that maybe we ought 
to blow that chart up a little more so 
we can see and project just how much 
more concentration occurs when we 
force more small- and medium-sized 
processors out of the business. It will 
result in increased concentration with 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MANN), a

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5621 
June 16, 2022 
great member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee who represents the Big First 
Congressional District. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak in opposition to H.R. 7606. 
I support our country’s farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural producers 
because they are the lifeblood of Amer-
ica. They keep us food and fuel secure 
and therefore free and self-determining 
as a Nation. 
I cosponsor the Year-Round Fuel 
Choice Act, which would address limi-
tations on Reid vapor pressure and 
allow for producers to supply, and con-
sumers to purchase, E15 year-round. I 
have supported this measure long be-
fore my time in Congress, and I will 
continue to be a strong proponent of 
year-round E15. A temporary waiver is 
not enough. We must make this deci-
sion permanent and provide certainty 
to producers. That bill is now part of 
H.R. 7606. 
I cosponsor the Butcher Block Act, 
which would codify the authority for 
the Secretary of Agriculture to make 
grants and loans to expand meat and 
poultry processing capacity. I support 
consumer choice. That bill is now part 
of H.R. 7606. 
In the House Agriculture Committee, 
I voted in favor of four other bills that 
are now part of H.R. 7606, but today’s 
vote is disappointing because House 
Democrats ignored an effort made by 
Mr. DAVIS and others, one I am proud 
to cosponsor, to include an amendment 
separating these good pro-agriculture 
bills from a poison pill. Included in 
H.R. 7606 is a provision that would cre-
ate a politically charged special inves-
tigator office at the U.S. Department 
of Agriculture to investigate and pros-
ecute food producers in America. 
You heard that right. The original 
H.R. 7606 and a provision in today’s so- 
called Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act 
would create a new office at USDA to 
investigate and prosecute the people 
who work to feed us. I represent the 
Big First District of Kansas, which 
ranks number one in the country for 
the value of sales of cattle and calves 
at more than $9 billion annually. We 
see the entire beef supply chain in the 
Big First, from cow-calf producers to 
cattle feeders and packers. Under the 
Packers and Stockyards Division at 
USDA, all of those players, all of them, 
are already subject to strict inspection. 
Under H.R. 7606, they would be subject 
to a type of politically charged scru-
tiny we expect of no other related busi-
ness. 
Do you think that a Democratic-con-
trolled Congress and USDA would stop 
there? No. H.R. 7606 would set the hor-
rible precedent for political adminis-
trations to inspect and prosecute any-
thing and anyone they disagree with. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 
seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, today it is 
packing facilities, tomorrow it is corn-
fields and biofuel facilities, or wheat 
growers and milling stations. I support 
farmers, ranchers, and agricultural 
producers in this country, and I am dis-
appointed this poison pill is included. 
b 0945 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I want to clear up something that the 
gentleman just said. It is very impor-
tant. The United States Department of 
Agriculture is the proper source to deal 
with this investigation. It needs to be 
investigated per the will of the Amer-
ican people, and there is no agency bet-
ter equipped, better qualified, to find 
out what is going wrong. 
According to the USDA, the language 
is clear on the special investigator 
being a career employee. It only speci-
fies that the position be appointed by 
the Secretary and based on the quali-
fications of the individual. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Ms. 
CRAIG), a member of the House Com-
mittee on Agriculture. 
Ms. CRAIG. Mr. Speaker, Americans 
across the country are justifiably frus-
trated by the higher prices they are ex-
periencing at the pump, in the grocery 
store, and across the board. 
Right now, working families in every 
district across this country are crying 
out for relief. They are tired of polit-
ical games, and they are tired of par-
tisan attacks. Our constituents don’t 
want Congress in a food fight. They 
want compromise, and they want solu-
tions. 
My friends, today, we have a bipar-
tisan, commonsense solution at our 
fingertips. 
The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act 
will lift up our constituents by low-
ering prices at the grocery store aisle 
and at the pump and creating a situa-
tion where we are seen as acting to-
gether. 
My provision, the Year-Round Fuel 
Choice Act, will allow for the year- 
round sale of homegrown biofuels, 
which can sell for as much as 40 cents 
less per gallon than traditional gaso-
line. Why would we deny that low-cost 
alternative to working families who 
are so desperate for savings? 
My Strengthening the Agriculture 
and Food Supply Chain Act will help 
lower prices at the grocery store by 
getting products from ships to shelves 
faster and shoring up our food supply 
chain 
for 
future 
generations. 
My 
friends, why would we deny these crit-
ical savings to our constituents who 
are simply trying to put food on the 
table? 
The American people want action. 
They are calling for us to use every 
tool at our disposal to fight inflation 
and lower costs. We must respond to 
their call. 
I appreciate the support of this pack-
age from my Democratic colleagues 
and many of my Republican colleagues, 
and I encourage all of you to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
During the recent packer hearing, 
Chairman SCOTT
mentioned that he 
used a chart compiled of what really 
was cherry-picked data with zero con-
text to accuse all four of the major beef 
packing CEOs of price-fixing and collu-
sion. 
The packing executives explained the 
multitudes of supply and demand dy-
namics supporting the data, including 
the cyclical ebbs and flows of cattle 
production. Each of them denied the 
chairman’s accusation under oath. 
Despite their denial, this week at the 
Rules Committee, the chairman ac-
cused the packers of lying under oath. 
According to the chairman, a price-fix-
ing scheme is the only plausible expla-
nation for increased meat prices. It is 
no wonder I have serious doubts about 
this administration’s ability to objec-
tively carry out these new authorities. 
I agree with the chairman, who is a 
dear friend. We work well together on 
well over 99 percent of everything that 
we engage on, just not this particular 
poison pill today. USDA is the right 
place to be the cop on the beat for this. 
In fact, they already are. 
USDA already has an entire Packers 
and Stockyards Division charged with 
enforcing the Packers and Stockyard 
Act that has been in place since the 
1930s. Based on the latest available 
data, they have filed and closed almost 
1,900 cases just in 2020 alone. The divi-
sion already consists of a team of sea-
soned attorneys, market specialists, 
and auditors, and it has the option to 
pursue 
administrative 
enforcement 
through USDA’s Office of General 
Counsel before an administrative law 
judge or through the Department of 
Justice in Federal court. 
I agree the USDA is the place for 
oversight of the packing industry, and 
it is already in place. This duplicative 
mandate with all the issues it brings is 
not warranted. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
CRAWFORD), the vice ranking member 
of the House Agriculture Committee. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
think the American people need to un-
derstand two things. One, if you eat, 
you are involved in agriculture. And, 
two, food security is national security. 
So, we keep those things in mind as we 
have this conversation today. Everyone 
in this room is involved in agriculture. 
Despite that, we have before us today 
a bill that makes it more difficult for 
our farmers and ranchers to carry out 
their primary mission, which is to feed, 
clothe, and shelter 98 percent of the 
population that is not engaged in agri-
culture. Two percent of Americans pro-
vide for 100 percent of Americans and 
the rest of the world. This bill doesn’t 
truly address the challenges that they 
face every day. 
Democrats would rather demonize 
producers in the private sector instead 
of taking responsibility for the infla-

June 16, 2022 
constituents every day everywhere in 
the country. Every day, our world be-
comes more globalized and our econo-
mies become more interconnected. As a 
result, the need for food security 
grows. 
One day, Russia is weaponizing food 
in Ukraine, and the next day, China is 
buying pieces of the American agri-
culture supply chain. 
I have said it before and will say it 
again: Agriculture security is national 
security, and we can no longer afford 
to stand by while our adversaries ex-
ploit the supply chain and American 
food security flounders under contin-
ued inflation inflicted by this adminis-
tration. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 7606. For those of us who represent 
rural constituents, this should be the 
easiest ‘‘no’’ vote you ever make. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Let me clarify something the rank-
ing member said. Yes, I was able to 
bring 
in 
all 
four 
CEOs 
of 
our 
meatpacking companies, and we were 
very grateful that they accepted our 
invitation. But our ranking member 
made a mistake. It wasn’t all four that 
said in answer to my question about 
whether or not they agreed or had any 
agreement on pricing in our meat in-
dustry. Three said no; one said, ‘‘Not to 
my knowledge.’’ 
Now, you must understand what we 
are dealing with here and why just that 
reply from them requires an investiga-
tion. That is what we are here for. That 
is why we did the hearing, to bring 
those parties in. 
We must act, Mr. Speaker. As I said 
before, we cannot continue to lose 
17,000 ranchers and farmers. Also, so 
many of them, thousands of them, have 
not made a profit in 5 years. We have a 
problem. 
In a report, the GAO noted that the 
USDA’s investigations were planned 
and conducted primarily by econo-
mists, without the formal involvement 
of attorneys from USDA’s Office of 
General Counsel, or the OGC. As a re-
sult, a legal perspective that focused 
on assessing potential violations was 
generally absent when investigations 
were initiated and conducted. This is 
precisely why the special investigator 
bill is so important, because it allevi-
ates an issue that has not had enough 
scrutiny and ensures that attorneys 
will be responsible for looking into pos-
sible violations. 
The GAO also found that the USDA’s 
Packers and Stockyards Act, PSA, in-
vestigations had not modernized to 
keep up with today’s complex, com-
petition-related concerns, with consoli-
dation at the heart of this issue, nor 
had 
it 
implemented 
previous 
rec-
ommendations. It also recommended 
that GIPSA and USDA’s Office of Gen-
eral Counsel work more closely to-
gether. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE), the distinguished chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker from 
New Jersey, I thank Chairman SCOTT 
for the time and all he has been doing 
with his committee to put this excel-
lent bill together. 
Today, once again, in my opinion, 
the House is taking action to fight 
high gas prices and protect consumers 
by empowering farmers to provide 
homegrown fuel choices at the pump, 
an option that costs consumers 40 
cents less per gallon. 
At a time when Americans are pay-
ing record-high prices for gas, Big Oil 
continues to exploit market instability 
caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine 
to rake in record profits. 
Big Oil companies collectively made 
$41 billion in profits during the first 
quarter of this year. Some of these 
were record highs; others were the 
highest profits in over a decade. 
It is abundantly clear that Big Oil 
companies are more interested in fun-
neling billions in profits to their share-
holders and executives than in address-
ing record-high gas prices for American 
consumers. 
The House has to act, Mr. Speaker, 
to protect American families from this 
profiteering. That is why we are here 
today, to preserve and expand the 
availability of a cheaper and cleaner 
fuel option for the driving public. 
The Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act 
combats fuel prices by allowing for the 
voluntary, year-round sale of gasoline 
containing 15 percent ethanol, known 
as E15 or Unleaded 88. Blending more 
biofuels like ethanol into gasoline dis-
places demand for petroleum, helping 
to bring down gas prices for consumers. 
Today, drivers are paying, on aver-
age, about 40 cents less per gallon to 
fill up their tanks with E15. This fuel 
provides significant savings for fami-
lies during the summer driving season. 
Let’s ensure it continues to be avail-
able at gas stations across the country. 
Increasing the availability of E15 
protects Americans from volatile glob-
al oil markets and eases the grip Big 
Oil has on American drivers. 
By 
relying 
more 
on 
homegrown 
biofuels and less on fossil fuels, this 
legislation insulates American drivers 
from dramatic global price fluctua-
tions, enhances our national security, 
creates local jobs, and bolsters true en-
ergy independence. It is a win-win 
across the board. It is one of the most 
powerful tools in our fight against 
global price shocks and oil and gas 
profiteering. 
E15 is also a cleaner fuel option that 
emits less carbon pollution and burns 
cleaner than regular gasoline. Today’s 
vote is also part of our broader effort 
to bring down prices while cutting cli-
mate pollution. 
I thank Representatives CRAIG and 
AXNE for their leadership on preserving 
and expanding access to E15 across the 
country and Chairman SCOTT, once 
again, for including these critical E15 
provisions in this package. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s help bring down 
gas prices at the pump, strengthen our 
Nation’s rural communities, and break 
the grip of Big Oil by passing the 
Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act today. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
ROUZER), a member of the Committee 
on Agriculture. 
Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, listening 
to the debate this morning reminds me 
of something President Ronald Reagan 
once said. He said: Our friends on the 
other side of the aisle, they know so 
much that just isn’t so. 
How interesting it is that the title of 
this package is the exact opposite of 
what this legislation is going to do. It 
will do nothing to bring down the cost 
of food and energy. Instead, it is mak-
ing excuses for the crises caused by the 
Biden 
administration’s 
attacks 
on 
American agriculture and energy. 
Now, there are a few good pieces of 
bipartisan legislation in this package, 
but our friends on the other side of the 
aisle refuse to allow these bills to re-
ceive their individual votes. Instead, 
they are using the good provisions here 
as pawns in their political messaging. 
b 1000 
One of the really harmful bills in this 
package, as has been discussed, the 
Meat and Poultry Special Investigator 
Act, creates a duplicative office within 
the USDA that will only add to the 
regulatory burden of our food proc-
essors across the country, and that is 
going to increase costs. 
The investigator would be granted 
independent litigation authority, al-
lowing for civil suits against packers 
at the whim of the Secretary without 
even consulting with the DOJ. It 
should be noted, the DOJ already 
launched an investigation into the 
‘‘Big Four’’ for anticompetitive prac-
tices in May of 2020 and has declined to 
provide Congress with an update even 2 
years into that investigation. 
The bottom line is increasing regula-
tion will raise food prices, not make 
them more affordable. Our farm fami-
lies need inputs at a fair price. They 
need diesel prices to come down. They 
need to be able to produce the food to 
feed this country and the world with-
out the government making it harder 
and harder day in and day out. That is 
why this package must be defeated. 
Rather than more regulation, we 
must unleash the full ability of Amer-
ican production. We must work for our 
farm families and do what is right and 
defeat this bill. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER), who is also the chair of 
our Conservation and Forestry Sub-
committee. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
am proud to rise in support of my legis-
lation, H.R. 7606, the Lower Food and 
Fuel Costs Act. 
Congress cannot shy away from ad-
dressing the urgent economic chal-
lenges that face our local communities

and our entire country, and that chal-
lenge continues to be inflation. We 
know how rising prices, consolidation 
across industries, and supply chain 
challenges are impacting America’s 
families, businesses, and seniors, and 
as lawmakers, our job is to listen to 
the people we represent and then re-
spond with legislation that can help 
solve those problems. 
Indeed, this package, the Lower Food 
and Fuel Costs Act, is just that. It is a 
compilation of bills put together by 
lawmakers who are responding to their 
constituents. I have heard from the 
other side of the aisle that, in fact, it 
would have been nice if we came to-
gether in a bipartisan way. So I would 
note that my colleagues on the Repub-
lican side of the aisle from Iowa, Ar-

nois, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Il-

nesota, each of these are individual 
Members of Congress from the Repub-

In fact, two of the bills in this pack-
age are led by our Republican col-
leagues, and I am proud that I have 
joined with Congressman DUSTY JOHN-
SON in support of the bipartisan Butch-
er Block Act. I am proud to be his co- 
lead as he leads that important piece of 
legislation. It is a commonsense step 
toward allowing American processors 
the ability to expand their operations, 
launch a new business or just make 
sure they are keeping— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the distinguished gentlewoman. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, 
this is the first step towards lowering 
meat prices, but in addition to increas-
ing processing capacity for American 
cattlemen and poultry producers, we 
need to go after anticompetitive prac-
tices in the meat industry. 
That is why I am proud that this 
package also includes the bipartisan 
Meat and Poultry Special Investigator 
Act. The bill would establish a special 
investigator at USDA to investigate 
violations of our existing antitrust 
laws that have been on the books for 
more than 100 years, and I thank Con-
gresswoman MILLER-MEEKS for co-lead-
ing this effort. 
This bill has broad bipartisan support 
and bicameral support. So I thank Sen-
ator JON TESTER, Senator GRASSLEY, 
Republican; Senator JOHN THUNE, Re-
publican; Senator HOEVEN, Republican; 
and Senator ROUNDS, Republican, for 
joining with us in pushing this bill for-
ward. It has support from the U.S. 
Cattlemen’s Association, and this bill 
is responsive to the needs of the people 
I represent because the Virginia Cattle-
men’s Association supports this bill, as 
does the National Farmers Union. 
Americans want lower meat prices 
both now and in the future. They want 
lower gas prices and to make biofuels 
accessible to more Americans. We have 
the opportunity to do that. I urge my 
colleagues to support this package. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to this 
bill. 
To suggest that this bill is a collabo-
rative effort is simply inaccurate. 
There could be a number of other ways 
to describe that as well, but it is unfor-
tunate that we are at a place where we 
could have had an opportunity to ad-
vance some good legislation. 
I am a supporter of the E15 bill. I 
have done a lot of work on this, and 
not just because gas prices are high 
right now, but because I think that E15 
and allowing consumers more choices 
at the pump would actually engage 
consumers as it relates to energy pol-
icy and energy products. 
I do have serious concerns, though, 
as others have mentioned, about provi-
sions that the Democrats insisted be 
included in this bill, like the new, very 
duplicative investigative authority at 
USDA. 
Even more concerning to me is 
Democrats’ continued strategy of seek-
ing to blame others for the situation 
on energy and the cost of virtually ev-
erything in our economy rather than 
acknowledging that President Biden’s 
economic policies have actually cre-
ated this mess. 
Biden stimulus dollars have driven 
inflation. Biden’s stimulus dollars paid 
Americans not to return to work, 
therefore, worsening our supply chain 
crisis. The President’s executive orders 
canceling new lease options and shut-
ting down the Keystone XL pipeline 
have certainly contributed to increased 
gas prices. 
Real inflation relief legislation would 
actually reign in spending, get more 
Americans back to work, provide broad 
regulatory relief, and increase domes-
tic energy production. This bill is cer-
tainly not it. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. PELOSI), 
our 
distinguished 
Speaker 
of 
the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and for his 
leadership in bringing this important 
legislation to the floor. I commend him 
and the members of the committee, as 
we just heard from Congresswoman 
SPANBERGER, for their very important 
work recognizing the needs of Amer-
ica’s working families with their kitch-
en table issues, recognizing the needs 
in rural America for us to have legisla-
tion that strengthens rural America’s 
hand in the decisions that we make as 
we go forward. 
Mr. Speaker, as we gather here, the 
war continues in Ukraine. It is an 
unprovoked, outrageous act of aggres-
sion on the part of Putin and Russia in-
vading 
the 
territorial 
borders 
of 
Ukraine. 
At the same time, doing that has 
driven up prices here at home, driven 
up prices at the pump; it is a Putin 
price at the pump. That is the main 
reason, in the short period of time fol-
lowing the invasion of Ukraine, the 
price at the pump went up its highest 
amount in a very long time. 
Russia is also a source of fertilizer, a 
big source of fertilizer to our country, 
and of course, diminishing the supply 
coming in raises the cost of fertilizer 
and contributes to the cost for our 
farmers, and of course, then contrib-
utes to the price of food at the grocery 
store. It is an important kitchen table 
issue. 
Putin’s price at the pump is exacer-
bating the skyrocketing costs weighing 
heavily on our families. Again, since 
Russia began its saber-rattling against 
Ukraine, gas prices in many places 
went up $2 per gallon. 
Meanwhile, the World Bank reports 
that global food prices in March and 
April spiked 16 percent over the 2 
months prior, and while Putin works to 
fuel inflation today, the Democratic 
House—hopefully, 
in 
a 
bipartisan 
way—takes a strong step to bring down 
crucial kitchen table costs at the pump 
and grocery store and across the board. 
Our Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act 
does precisely what the name suggests 
in three major areas. 
First, the bill brings down the costs 
for farmers in the field. As we know, 
oil, gasoline is an important factor of 
production for farmers in order for 
them to produce. The war in Ukraine 
has restricted the supply of fertilizer, 
as I mentioned, and sent the costs 
through the roof. By taking action to 
lower the costs on the farm, we lower 
the costs on the shelf in the grocery 
store and on the kitchen table. 
Second, this bill bolsters competition 
in the meatpacking industry, and I 
thank Mr. SCOTT for his leadership. 
Cracking down on the market power of 
big conglomerates and increasing com-
petition will ensure ranchers get a fair 
deal for their livestock while families 
get a good price for meat and poultry. 
Third, this bill will help make cheap-
er, cleaner homegrown biofuels more 
widely available. This summer drivers 
who choose to fill up with Unleaded 88 
could save an average of 40 cents a gal-
lon, and by making this fuel more 
widely available it will unleash the 
power of America’s farmers to help 
break the grip of foreign autocrats on 
energy markets; lower gas prices, while 
keeping our dollars here at home; and 
reduce pollution because biofuels are 
cleaner than petroleum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5624 
June 16, 2022 
Today’s action to lower food and fuel 
costs is the latest manifestation of 
House Democrats’ unyielding commit-
ment to fight inflation. 
Last month, our majority voted to 
hold Big Oil accountable for price 
gouging and war profiteering, which 
has kept energy prices excessively 
high. 
This week, we passed legislation to 
crack down on exorbitant ocean ship-
ping fees, leveling the playing field for 
American 
businesses 
and 
lowering 
costs for American consumers. Proudly 
today, President Biden will sign this 
legislation into law. It is called the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 2022. 
As we speak, the Congress is hard at 
work on a bold, bipartisan, bicameral 
competitiveness package to make more 
goods in America; strengthen our sup-
ply chains; diversify our STEM work-
force; and reinvigorate research and de-
velopment. We look forward to sending 
this strong cost-cutting legislation to 
the President’s desk. 
Here is the thing: Inflation springs 
from higher costs. Higher costs spring 
from shorter supply. Shorter supply is 
there because of COVID preventing cer-
tain products from coming into our 
country, so short supply. Short supply 
of factors of production coming into 
our country. 
That is why the COMPETES Act is so 
important because it will make us 
more independent, more self-sufficient 
on the products we need; for example, 
chips. Chips are a very important part 
of that bill. To make a car it takes 
1,000 chips; an electric car, 2,000 chips. 
But we can’t do that manufacturing 
unless we have chips, and if other coun-
tries are saving chips for themselves at 
home or the high fees of transporting 
them make it just unaffordable to peo-
ple, we need to make these chips at 
home, and that is what the COMPETES 
Act enables us to do. 
So lowering costs for our families; 
when we ran in 2018—just to bring back 
promises made—we said we were going 
to lower costs by lowering the costs of 
prescription drugs, and that is what we 
are in the midst of doing now. We are 
going to lower costs in every way for 
America’s working families. That is 
what this legislation does here. 
We are going to have bigger pay-
checks. And we have had, since Presi-
dent Biden took office, working with 
the private sector and the nonprofit 
sector and the public sector, 8 million 
jobs have been created. Unemployment 
has been cut in half. Wages have gone 
up. That also contributes to inflation, 
which must be addressed, and this leg-
islation is part of doing that. 
So this legislation is a strong step in 
that direction, and I salute the relent-
less 
leadership 
of 
the 
Agriculture 
chair, DAVID SCOTT, and the Energy 
and Commerce chair, FRANK PALLONE, 
who is an important part of this, as 
well as Representatives SPANBERGER, 
CRAIG, AXNE, and HARDER and the dedi-
cated staff of both committees. 
Together, they have assembled a 
package of popular bipartisan legisla-
tion with a laser focus on fighting in-
flation. 
b 1015 
Make no mistake, a vote against this 
bill is a vote to keep the cost of gas 
and groceries high, when we can do just 
the opposite by voting for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. ROSE), 
a strong agriculture advocate and a 
leader in agriculture. 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
make it clear: just because Democrats 
named their bill the Lower Food and 
Fuel Costs Act does not mean this bill 
will achieve that goal. 
The only thing it really achieves is a 
campaign talking point for Democrats 
responding to constituents frustrated 
with higher prices at the grocery store 
and the gas station caused by their 
reckless spending. 
Instead of wasting our valuable time 
debating this bill that will never be-
come law, we should pass H.R. 8069, the 
Reducing Farm Input Costs and Bar-
riers to Production Act, introduced by 
Ranking Member THOMPSON, which in-
cludes real, immediate solutions our 
farmers, ranchers, and producers sup-
port. 
His bill, which I am proud to support, 
would reverse the EPA’s reckless ac-
tions related to crop production tools, 
reverse the Biden administration’s con-
fusing and disastrous changes to the 
Waters of the United States rule, and 
would withdraw the SEC’s ludicrous 
ESG rule on climate-related disclo-
sures, an action that has received bi-
partisan support. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, ci-
vilians 
and 
soldiers 
are 
dying 
in 
Ukraine and the American people are 
feeling it in their pocket, even as they 
rise up to support democracy. The 
American people know there is a prob-
lem. 
As we stand on the floor today, the 
good news is that Democrats care. 
That is why we rise today to offer the 
Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act be-
cause the American people see it. They 
see it at the gas station on their way 
home or to work, they see it at the gro-
cery store when their carts are half 
empty, and they see it with their hard- 
earned paychecks that don’t meet what 
they need. Inflation—they know about 
it. 
You know what, they are looking for 
a fighting team like the Democrats to 
make something happen, not a whin-
ing, complaining, get-nothing-done. In 
my community, the interest rates are 
8.5 percent of the cost of goods in Hous-
ton, Texas. I am not going home and 
telling them that we are out here 
working. I ask for our colleagues to 
recognize the importance of lowering 
costs at the grocery store, ensuring ro-
bust competition, and helping farmers. 
Let us fight to pass this bill. We care. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7606, 
the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, that 
would shore up the food and agriculture sup-
ply chain, assure fair competition in the meat 
and poultry sectors, and lower food and gaso-
line costs to the American consumer. 
The American people know that there is a 
problem. 
They see it. 
They see it at the gas station on their way 
home from work. 
They see it when they leave the grocery 
store with a half empty cart. 
They see it when their hard-earned pay-
checks stretch less and less. 
Inflation rose by 8.6 percent in May, a 40- 
year high. 
The price of all goods in the Houston metro 
area have jumped by 8.5 percent since April 
2021—the highest year-over-year jump since 
1981. 
My constituents aren’t suddenly making 8.5 
percent more than they did a year ago, mind 
you. 
No, they are now going without. 
The cost of the most basic commodities— 
electricity, oil, meats, and dairy—have gone 
up at alarming rates, and our people are dis-
proportionately bearing the burden of inflation. 
An income that previously fed and housed a 
family, provided life-supporting medication, 
and got people to work and back is now capa-
ble of paying only half of those bills. 
Our constituents are forced to choose be-
tween picking up a prescription or paying for 
childcare, between keeping the lights on and 
keeping the pantry full. 
These are not choices American families 
should have to make. 
Congress must act to rebalance the finan-
cial scales in this country. 
This package includes the following bills: 
H.R. 7606—‘‘Meat and Poultry Special In-
vestigators Act’’ which Establishes an Office of 
the Special Investigator for Competition Mat-
ters in the Agriculture Secretary’s Office. 
H.R. 7764—‘‘To direct the Secretary of Agri-
culture to provide additional payments under 
the Environmental Quality Incentives Program 
for implementation of nutrient management 
practices’’ which would provide additional as-
sistance to specialty and row crop producers 
who undertake USDA Natural Resources Con-
servation Service practice standards to use 
fertilizers more efficiently, do soil testing, or 
seek out other sources of plant nutrients. 
H.R. 2518—‘‘PRECISE Act—Producing Re-
sponsible Energy and Conservation Incentives 
and Solutions for the Environment’’ which ex-
plicitly states precision agriculture eligibility in 
Environmental 
Quality 
Incentive 
Program 
(EQIP) and Conservation Stewardship Pro-
gram, allows a producer who receives pay-
ments under EQIP to also receive a conserva-
tion loan guarantee, and allows up to a 90 
percent cost share for precision agriculture 
under EQIP. 
H.R. 1542—‘‘Renewable Fuel Infrastructure 
Investment and Market Expansion Act of 
2021’’ which would deploy additional storage 
and dispensing equipment to ensure that high-

round sale of gasoline containing 15 percent 
ethanol, know as E–15 or Unleaded 88. 
H.R. 7675—‘‘Strengthening the Agriculture 
and Food Supply Chain Act’’ which would cre-
ate an Agricultural and Food System Supply 
Chain Resilience and Crisis Response Task 
Force at USDA, headed by a Special Advisor 
on Supply Chain Resilience and Crisis Re-
sponse. 
H.R. 4140—‘‘Butcher Block Act’’ which 
would provide assistance to create new and 
expand current local and regional livestock 
and meat processing capacity with direct or 
guaranteed loans. 
From the soil in which our farmers plant 
their seeds, to the fuel that transports vegeta-
bles to our grocers, to the very meat on our 
tables, this package will enact positive legisla-
tion that the American people will be able to 
see. 
The spike in food and energy prices are at 
the center of inflation. 
Beginning at the root, as producers across 
the country face skyrocketing fertilizer prices, 
we must help producers reduce their input 
costs so planting decisions are not impacted. 
Expanding access to precision agriculture 
technology is critical now, as we face climate 
change and fertilizer costs that have doubled 
or almost tripled. 
Breakdowns and bottlenecks in the food and 
agriculture supply chain, resulting from the 
COVID–19 pandemic, have been well docu-
mented and have caused significant losses 
and concerns to our agricultural constituents. 
Over the last few decades, there has been 
an influx of domination in the meat packing in-
dustry by four large companies resulting in 
raised prices and reduced options for prod-
ucts. 
COVID–19 highlighted the country’s dan-
gerous reliance on large beef plants run by 
the four biggest processors. 
The pandemic caused slaughterhouses na-
tionwide to close to contain outbreaks of the 
virus among workers. 
Ranchers were and still are frustrated that 
cattle prices drop when major plants close, 
while meat companies still benefit from rising 
meat prices. 
Farmers’ share of profits have gone down, 
while American consumers continue to pay 
more, with meat prices being the single largest 
contributor to the rising cost of food people 
consume at home. 
A fair and competitive market is funda-
mental to a well-functioning U.S. economy. 
When firms have to compete for customers, 
it leads to lower prices, higher quality goods 
and services, greater variety, and more inno-
vation. 
Strengthening enforcement of the Packer 
and Stockyards Act will lead to greater com-
petition in the meat and poultry processing, 
fairer access to markets for producers, and 
more price stability for consumers. 
Increased processing capacity will alleviate 
some supply chain bottlenecks and provide 
producers with more options to market their 
cattle and receive a fair price. 
The supply chain will be more resilient and 
competitive long term as a result. 
With regard to our energy and fuel crisis, 
further use of biofuels will reduce prices at the 
pump for all Americans and increase the sup-
ply of fuel available. 
Biofuels adoption and investment helps re-
duce our reliance on foreign oil and the supply 
shocks facing our gasoline supply while also 
bolstering a revenue stream for farmers 
across the country. 
E–10 gasoline, gasoline containing 10 per-
cent ethanol, is currently sold year-round, 
while the sale of E–15 gasoline, gasoline con-
taining 15 percent ethanol, is dependent on 
receiving special waivers despite both having 
very similar emission profiles when it comes to 
smog formation. 
Year-round sale of gasoline containing 15 
percent ethanol (E–15) will reduce the price at 
the pump for American drivers by giving con-
sumers the choice to purchase a fuel that is 
substantially cheaper than standard gasoline. 
The American people need legislative inter-
vention in a market that is increasingly becom-
ing more concentrated and suffering from sup-
ply chain disruptions. 
This package provides small concrete ac-
tions that will invoke change and provide both 
short-term immediate and long-term contin-
uous relief. 
I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 
7606, the Lower Food and Fuel Cost Act. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. JACKSON). 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to a serious 
issue facing all of rural America: the 
Biden administration and the radical 
left’s war on agriculture. 
Today, the House will vote on H.R. 
7606, which will exacerbate fractured 
supply 
chains, 
skyrocketing 
input 
costs, and historic levels of inflation, 
all of which are hammering American 
consumers. 
This bill is the latest attempt to 
scapegoat private industry rather than 
address the real needs and concerns of 
farmers, ranchers, and rural Ameri-
cans. We know the Biden administra-
tion and my colleagues across the aisle 
see Americans in the oil and gas indus-
try as the enemy, and I truly believe 
they now see farmers and ranchers as 
the enemy, too. 
Mr. Speaker, I want my constituents 
back home in Texas to know that this 
is something I am fighting for every 
day. I represent the number one ag dis-
trict in the State of Texas, and farmers 
and ranchers in my district are experi-
encing out-of-control input costs for 
fertilizer, fuel, and basic parts for 
equipment. I can assure you the legis-
lation we are voting on today will 
make that worse. 
A spending and regulatory agenda 
that compounds the situation further 
limits American ag industry’s ability 
to meet global food demands is not the 
answer. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. HARDER), a 
member of the House Agriculture Com-
mittee. 
Mr. 
HARDER 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today frustrated, and to 
be honest, just plain tired. 
For months now, my community has 
been paying over $6 a gallon for gas and 
$5 for a jug of milk. Prices are out of 
control, and it is crushing us. I talked 
to a neighbor the other day and she 
told me she is going to have to choose 
between picking her kids up from 
school and driving herself to work, if 
gas prices stay this high. 
Families in my neighborhood don’t 
have the luxury of sitting around while 
politicians do nothing. Today, we have 
a chance to actually help by passing 
our Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act. 
This package includes my bill, which 
provides funding for farmers to imple-
ment nutrient management programs. 
These programs will help lower the 
cost of growing food for our farmers, so 
prices go back to normal at the grocery 
store. 
Helping farmers lower costs while 
cutting gas prices for our families is 
common sense. It is beyond time that 
Congress put politics aside and actu-
ally listen to what our communities 
need. This isn’t rocket science. They 
are asking for the government to do its 
job and bring these prices back down to 
Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope common sense 
prevails today, and let’s pass this bill. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN), a 
great member of the Agriculture Com-
mittee. 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I stand 
here in disbelief at how Washington is 
trying to run this economy. That is the 
reason I ran for office because things 
were so bad, and it was impossible to 
grow your business. 
I am reminded of what we actually 
did when we had the House, and the 
Congress, and the White House. We 
passed the Constitutional Review Act. 
Through that act, we got no help from 
the other side, and then we passed 
some tax reform to give people more 
money to invest in their businesses. 
Let me tell you what happened. For 
the first time in my life we became en-
ergy independent. For the first time we 
became an energy power. We had more 
jobs than people looking for jobs. So 
what happened now? Joe Biden was the 
Vice-President when I was elected. He 
is now the President. All those execu-
tive orders he signed stopped every-
thing we did to put this country on the 
right track. 
Mr. Speaker, I am tired of this. I de-
mand immediately that we stop this 
war on American energy that is driving 
up costs and stop overregulating our ag 
producers. 
Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), my friend, the 
distinguished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the chair-
man has done a wonderful job as the 
chairman of the Agriculture Com-
mittee, and I know that you are work-
ing together to bring people together. 
One of the things that I most admire 
about Chairman SCOTT is that he wants 
to have a bipartisan result coming out 
of his committee, and I think in this 
bill he has. 
Mr. Speaker, every day Americans 
across the country must contend with

the rising prices caused by inflation. 
Whenever they pull up to the gas 
pump, they face the repercussions of 
Vladimir Putin’s criminal invasion of 
Ukraine, which has made gas prices 
skyrocket—not just because of the 
sanctions, not because of Russia’s pro-
duction, but because of the lack of con-
fidence in the future that this war has 
caused. 
Whenever our people go to the gro-
cery 
store, 
they 
suffer 
the 
con-
sequences 
of 
the 
havoc 
that 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic has inflicted on 
global supply chains. Unfortunately, 
we cannot erase the past crises that led 
to our current economic situation. 
I say to the Members of this Congress 
that we can take the meaningful steps 
today to lower prices for consumers 
and to stimulate America’s economy in 
the weeks and months to come. That is 
why House Democrats are focusing all 
week on easing inflation and bringing 
costs down. I know that is what my Re-
publican colleagues want to do as well. 
While this may not be a perfect alter-
native—there are no perfect alter-
natives—this is a positive step toward 
decreasing the costs to our people of 
things that they must buy: fuel and 
food. To support that mission, I am 
proud to bring the Lower Food and 
Fuel Costs Act to the floor today, at 
Mr. SCOTT’s request. 
America’s farmers and ranchers have 
long fed our Nation, and indeed, much 
of the world. Despite their essential 
work, however, they have often strug-
gled to turn a reliable profit in recent 
years because of rising expenses, asso-
ciated particularly with fertilizer—the 
costs of which have gone up very sub-
stantially as a result of the crisis that 
we confront. 
By making fertilizer more affordable 
and by improving farmers’ access to 
loans for precision agricultural tech-
nology, this legislation will help lower 
these production costs, which burden 
smaller farmers and contribute to 
higher consumer food prices. 
Additionally, this bill will lower gas 
prices by increasing biofuel adoption 
and investment, and by giving con-
sumers greater fuel choices at the 
pump. 
Lack of competition in the meat and 
poultry processing industries has also 
jeopardized many of our family farmers 
and the people they feed. Competition 
is the essence of a free market. Com-
petition is the essence of establishing 
prices that are reasonable and fair, 
both to producers and to consumers. 
Fortunately, Mr. Speaker, this legis-
lation will help level that playing field 
for small and independent producers 
trying to break into the industry, 
which will both boost our meat proc-
essing capacity and stoke healthy com-
petition and innovation, which both 
sides of the aisle believe is the way we 
have created this extraordinary econ-
omy we know as the American econ-
omy: competition and free markets. 
Similarly, this bill establishes a dedi-
cated office within the Department of 
Agriculture to strengthen enforcement 
of existing antitrust authorities to 
consult on trade practices, ensuring a 
fairer, more competitive industry that 
works better for consumers. 
We know that if just a few producers 
have a monopoly—and that is one of 
the problems with oil prices. We have 
OPEC nations who have constricted 
supply when demand was up. What in-
evitably happens in a free market? 
Prices rise. 
This is about free markets. This is 
about competition. This is about fair 
pricing for consumers. These reforms 
will enable our farmers to produce food 
more efficiently, driving down costs for 
Americans at the grocery store. 
Not only will this legislation help us 
respond to the ramifications of crises 
like the pandemic and the war in 
Ukraine, but they will also make our 
agricultural sector and our economy 
more resilient to future shocks. 
This legislation is a crucial step to-
ward reducing inflation. I thank Rep-
resentative SPANBERGER, Representa-
tive CRAIG, and Representative AXNE, 
and my friends on the Republican side 
who have worked on this, and my 
friends on the Democratic side who 
have worked on this. 
This is an important piece of legisla-
tion for the people—all of them. All of 
our Members listened closely to the 
concerns of their constituents and took 
a collaborative approach to come up 
with legislation that addresses some of 
the most pressing needs of the Amer-
ican people. 
b 1030 
I thank the ranking member of this 
committee for his thoughtfulness in 
approaching this issue. 
Today, every Member of this House 
has an opportunity to do something to 
ease inflation. Every Member has an 
opportunity to vote to ease inflation 
today. We are eager to take that ac-
tion, which is why we are bringing this 
to the floor and voting to pass it. 
I hope all of our Members will join us 
so we can show our constituents that 
their Congress is addressing inflation 
and working together on their behalf, 
not on our political behalves, but 
working together to pass this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues: 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK), who is an-
other great member of the House Agri-
culture Committee. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to H.R. 7606, the 
higher food and increased fuel costs 
act. 
I just cannot believe that at a time 
when we Americans all are paying 
more for everything, from gas, gro-
ceries, energy, and beyond, my col-
leagues on the left want more regula-
tion and more government interven-
tion. They want to blame Putin and 
the war in Ukraine, but they don’t 
want to accept responsibility for the 
very policies that are helping drive 
these increased costs. 
If the last year has taught us any-
thing, Mr. Speaker, it is that Big Gov-
ernment with a one-size-fits-all ap-
proach of spending into oblivion does 
not work. It turns out, shockingly, 
that taking cues from the Easter 
Bunny doesn’t work. 
Look at the facts: fuel, 106 percent 
up; eggs, 32 percent increase; fresh and 
frozen chicken, up 19.3 percent; milk, 
up 15.9 percent; bacon, up 15.6 percent; 
baby food, up almost 13 percent. Oh, by 
the way, we can’t find it. Let’s talk 
about that. 
Right now, our farmers—and I know 
this for a fact because I come from a 
rural producing district—have their 
backs up against a wall. With sky-
rocketing prices for inputs like fer-
tilizer, fuel, and feed, many of our pro-
ducers are now reaching a breaking 
point. 
This administration, however, seems 
hellbent on pushing them over the 
edge. The regulatory regime at the 
EPA—and 
I 
use 
that 
word 
delib-
erately—threatens the very livelihood 
of our producers and the long-term 
food security of our Nation. Everyone 
in this room can agree that food secu-
rity is national security, and it is dan-
gerous policy what the left is doing in 
taking out our producers. 
Now, it seems as if they are more fo-
cused on Green New Deal policies, and 
our districts will never be the same if 
we continue down this path. Any sort 
of tax or additional regulation is in-
creasing the costs to produce fuel and 
produce our food. 
This is a time when Americans, keep 
in mind, are making decisions between 
gas or groceries, and we are seriously 
up here talking about increasing costs 
for fuel and food? Give me a break. 
We need to slam the brakes on any 
policy that empowers more govern-
ment bureaucrats and impoverishes the 
people. 
We need to ensure that the EPA does 
not threaten the future of our pro-
ducers with such ridiculous, out-of- 
touch policies. I know that many of my 
colleagues, particularly in leadership, 
have not filled up a gas tank in prob-
ably 40 years, but I have. Two days ago, 
I paid over $5 per gallon of gas. That is 
what Americans are facing. We need to 
stop empowering these bureaucrats. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of the amend-
ment in the RECORD immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Mr. Speaker, if we 
adopt my motion to recommit, I will 
instruct the Committee on Agriculture 
to add my amendment that would pro-
hibit the EPA from regulating or tax-
ing emission from livestock. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to support the motion to re-
commit.

H5627 
June 16, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much 
time is remaining on each side of the 
aisle. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania has 5 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman has the 
only time remaining. The time of the 
gentleman from Georgia has expired. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to replow 
some of the fields and the comments 
that have been offered here today. One 
of my friends on the Agriculture Com-
mittee 
on 
the 
other 
side, 
Ms. 
SPANBERGER, claims industry support. 
She referenced two specific organiza-
tions. But it is certainly not wide-
spread support among farmers and 
ranchers. 
I will offer up this fact: Organiza-
tions that are constituted by farmers 
and ranchers, including the National 
Cattlemen’s Beef Association, which is 
a 
large 
cattlemen’s 
association 
throughout this country made up of 
men and women in the cattle industry, 
and the National Pork Producers Coun-
cil are organizations that oppose this 
piece of legislation. The National Pork 
Producers Council is made up of farm-
ers who raise hogs in so many different 
States in the United States of America. 
It is a huge industry in terms of agri-
culture. That organization opposes this 
bill. 
The National Chicken Council—poul-
try—is huge certainly in the State of 
Virginia, the State of Pennsylvania, 
and the State of Georgia. They oppose 
this piece of legislation that is on the 
floor today. The same thing with the 
National Turkey Federation and the 
North American Meat Institute. All are 
in opposition to this bill that we are 
voting on today. 
The American Farm Bureau Federa-
tion is not opposed publicly to the bill, 
but they have raised a litany of con-
cerns and unanswered questions. 
This bill comes with an additional 
price tag of $700 million, not offset, on 
many of the other provisions. Quite 
frankly, there are zero dollars for this 
duplicative poison pill part of this bill, 
the special investigator for cattle and 
pork. That leaves me concerned that 
the 
existing 
enforcement 
resources 
that I have already made reference to 
with USDA and the Department of Jus-
tice is going to be drained. We are ac-
tually probably going to see less effec-
tive investigations as a result of this. 
We are going to see an increase in 
consolidation because it is a new layer. 
If you are a packer of any size, not just 
the four big ones, but medium and 
small size, and you have a new cop for 
cows on the beat, then you are going to 
have to add compliance staff to be able 
to prepare when, quite frankly, the De-
partment of Justice and the Packers 
and Stockyards Division is already 
doing an incredible job. Active inves-
tigations are going on. 
I agree with an earlier speaker, I 
think it was Mr. LUCAS from Okla-
homa, if there is evidence of price-fix-
ing and collusion, we have a regulatory 
mechanism and a litigation mecha-
nism. People should be held account-
able to that. 
Although there are some really good 
parts of this bill, I am also dis-
appointed. We know that the only way 
we really get legislation through the 
other side of the Capitol, in the Senate, 
is where we show cohesion and where 
we stick together and work together. 
We have complete consensus on basi-
cally all the other aspects of this bill. 
We did request that this bill be divided 
and that the special investigator por-
tion come out of the bill. 
I think we could be scoring some vic-
tories for the American people and for 
the 
American 
farmers. 
But, 
quite 
frankly, I think to be in line with 
President Biden, because President 
Biden’s approach to everything, all the 
problems that have been created with 
his ill-fated policies, is that it is some-
body else’s fault. 
This is blaming the private sector, 
which works hard to provide us with 
the food that we need. This is blaming 
them when, quite frankly, it is a fail-
ure to take responsibility for what has 
happened on day one, starting with 
President Biden. 
We would love to work with Presi-
dent Biden to make sure we can ad-
dress inflation, but adding this $700 
million today, I have never seen, in my 
lifetime anyway, or my experience, 
how you can spend more money and 
spend your way out of inflation. It just 
doesn’t work that way. The economics 
do not work that way. The inflation 
issue, again, I have never seen inflation 
reduced by spending more money. 
I would respectfully encourage, be-
cause we can go back to the drawing 
board and take each of these bills that 
are really good bills, the bipartisan and 
strong bills, we ought to take those up 
individually and give Congress an op-
portunity to speak on behalf of the 
American people and affirm that these 
are good bills. Let the special investi-
gator stand on its own. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on H.R. 7606, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

SEC. 311. ADDRESSING FERTILIZER SHORTAGES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Agri-
culture shall support and incentivize domes-
tic activities through grants, loans, and 
other forms of assistance, to address fer-
tilizer shortages and deficiencies, diversify 
fertilizer sources, and reduce dependency on 
foreign sources for fertilizer, including by— 
(1) increasing the availability of innova-
tive fertilizer and fertilizer alternatives, in-
cluding nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, bio-
logical products and technologies, and other 
nutrients that may assist in the production 
of agricultural commodities; 
(2) increasing materials or tools that re-
duce the need for fertilizer or support the 
more efficient use of fertilizer, including ni-
trogen, 
phosphate, 
potassium, 
biological 
products and technologies, and other nutri-
ents that may assist in the production of ag-
ricultural commodities; 
(3) supporting materials and facilities and 
research and development, that may support 
the purposes of this section; 
(4) supporting sustainable agriculture pro-
duction through the supporting production 
of— 
(A) sustainable fertilizer produced in, or 
used in a manner that, reduces the green-
house gas impact; or 
(B) fertilizer produced through the use of 
renewable 
energy 
sources, 
including 
incentivizing greater precision in fertilizer 
use; 
(5) supporting activities or other measures 
that may otherwise address competition-re-
lated challenges in the United States fer-
tilizer market and obstacles to producers in 
obtaining affordable, responsibly manufac-
tured fertilizer as referred to in the notice 
entitled ‘‘Access to Fertilizer: Competition 
and Supply Chain Concerns’’ published by 
the Department of Agriculture in the Fed-
eral Register on March 17, 2022 (87 Fed Reg. 
15191 et seq.); and 
(6) using the facilities and authorities of 
the Commodity Credit Corporation and the 
authorities under section 1473H of the Na-

Teaching Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3319k). 
(b) PRIORITY APPLICANTS.—In selecting ac-
tivities to support under this section, the 
Secretary shall give priority to applications 
for such support containing proposals that 
the Secretary determines will most quickly 
address fertilizer shortages in the near term 
and mid-term. 
(c) STREAMLINED
PROCESS.—In providing 
assistance pursuant to this section, the Sec-
retary shall ensure that such assistance be 
provided through a streamlined and expe-
dient process (as determined necessary by 
the Secretary) to quickly address fertilizer 
shortages. 
(d) ADMINISTRATIVE
FUNDING.—Not more 
than 3 percent of the funding provided under 
this section may be used by the Secretary 
for administrative purposes.

there are authorized to be appropriated to 
carry out this section, $100,000,000, to remain 
available until expended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. KHANNA) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, my amendment would 
authorize a new program at the De-
partment of Agriculture to reduce our 
reliance on foreign sources of fertilizer. 
It is to make sure that America will be 
more self-sufficient and that our farm-
ers will be more self-sufficient with our 
fertilizers and not dependent on Russia 
or foreign countries. 
Everyone knows that retail fertilizer 
costs are at an all-time high. Putin’s 
invasion of Ukraine is driving severe 
food shortages and severe fertilizer 
shortages. This has driven up food 
prices and hurt American farmers and 
consumers across the country. In my 
district, food prices are up and fer-
tilizer prices are up. 
The cost of agricultural chemicals 
has more than doubled since the start 
of the pandemic, and one of the reasons 
is Russia is a major exporter of nitro-
gen, potassium, and phosphorus fer-
tilizers. 
We need to be less dependent on 
countries like Russia, and we need to 
develop these fertilizers here in the 
United States. That is why Congress 
must act on a bipartisan basis. 
This amendment is common sense. It 
would authorize $100 million for grants, 
loans, research and development, and 
other assistance for the Department of 
Agriculture to support our farmers in 
developing 
fertilizer 
made 
in 
the 
United States. 
It will support sustainable and inno-
vative domestic production of fer-
tilizers because our fertilizers are far 
more sustainable and far more innova-
tive than the fertilizers we get from 
other parts of the world. 
It will invest in practices that reduce 
the use of fertilizers. One of the best 
things we can do for food prices and 
our environment is to reduce the need 
for fertilizers by having those fer-
tilizers be more innovative. 
The amendment also bolsters com-
petition in the fertilizer market. 
Most important, it makes us less de-
pendent on the Russians and less de-
pendent on the global supply chain. It 
will create jobs for domestic producers 
of fertilizers. 
The Department of Agriculture is al-
ready supporting American-made fer-
tilizers through the Commodity Credit 
Corporation. My amendment will ex-
pand the Department’s authority so 
they can prioritize solutions that will 
most quickly address these shortages. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
amendment. I thank Chairman SCOTT 
for working with me on this amend-
ment. I also thank the Agriculture 
Committee staff of Anne Simmons, 
Lyron Blum-Evitts, Prescott Martin, 
Josh Lobert, and Luke Theriot for 
their work, and Kevin Fox on my team. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in oppo-
sition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I express my appreciation 
to the gentleman for bringing forth a 
concept that could provide relief, but 
not for many years. 
This is an amendment to a bill that 
talks about immediate reduction in 
food prices, but this is kind of a long- 
term investment. I appreciate that 
concept, but it is not what this bill 
says. It really doesn’t contribute to im-
mediate relief to American consumers 
or reducing input costs for our farmers 
in the immediate or near term. 
Working together is how the House 
Committee on Agriculture solves prob-
lems. The committee has been working 
together with the Department to bet-
ter understand this amendment, its 
purpose, and its implications. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department and I 
have agreed that this is not a near- 
term solution to the high price and 
limited availability of fertilizer. 
As the gentleman knows, this amend-
ment was pulled from consideration by 
my Democratic colleagues in a recent 
committee markup. 
b 1045 
Unfortunately, we have not learned 
much since then, which furthers my 
opposition to it. Growing the size of 
government by codifying the Biden ad-
ministration’s half-baked initiatives, 
authorizing $100 million, specifying fur-
ther use of the Commodity Credit Cor-
poration, and minimally funded re-
search programs is no way to tackle 
rising inflation or to address sky-
rocketing fertilizer costs. In fact, it 
leaves us in a rather more tenuous sit-
uation when it comes to our farmers. 
The Commodity Credit Corporation 
is what we use and what we depend on 
and rely on when our farmers fall on 
difficult times. And they are there, 
these input costs. 
Not in all commodities but in most 
commodities, we see a record price that 
they are getting for their commodity. 
But the fact is that agriculture is a 
business. Farming is a business. Ranch-
ing is a business. At the end of the day, 
it is the margin. It is not what you get 
paid. You have to consider what you 
are paying in input costs. 
With this inflation, with these types 
of policies we are talking about today, 
there will be many commodities that 
soon will be upside down. They will be 
more expensive to produce than what 
they are able to get for price. There are 
commodities that are already at that 
point. 
Draining the CCC in any year, in 2022, 
is not only wrong; it is dangerous. We 
are not going to have the resources to 
be able to help our farmers to keep 
them farming and to use the CCC for 
what its primary purpose and mission 
was about. 
Even more perplexing is the idea we 
would want to solidify in law concepts 
that USDA admittedly has not devel-
oped into programming or policy, as 
the public comment period was just ex-
tended yet again. 
Now, we would have been better 
served 
by 
considering 
Republican 
amendments, all of which would have 
provided immediate relief through re-
versing the regulatory assault stifling 
the 
innovation 
and 
exacerbating 
strained supply chains. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this amendment. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I respect the ranking member. We 
have worked together on a number of 
initiatives. 
I would just say that this amend-
ment, by giving the Commodity Credit 
Corporation resources, is helping make 
things in America. Whether it is imme-
diate or whether it is over the next few 
months, we should have a bipartisan 
consensus that we ought to be making 
more things in this country and be less 
dependent 
on 
Russia 
and 
foreign 
sources. 
While I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this 
amendment, I also hope that we can 
continue to work with the other side to 
find common ground over this Congress 
so that we can get bipartisan support 
for an effort to build more fertilizer in 
the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance 
of my time. 
The gentleman offered an amend-
ment. He is a good friend. We do work 
together. Another area of jurisdiction 
on the Agriculture Committee that 
shocks 
people, 
actually, 
is 
cryptocurrency because it is a com-
modity and traded and overseen by 
CFTC. He has been such a great part-
ner as we have worked together with 
those solutions. 
The whole concept of bipartisan 
work, it is alive and well in the Agri-
culture Committee, but just not re-
flected with this poison pill that is in 
this particular piece of legislation. 
With this amendment, I think, as I 
said before, yes, we need to be looking 
long term. But this legislation we are 
dealing with today, according to the 
Democrats, is supposed to have an im-
mediate reduction in inflation. 
While I believe we do need to do an 
investment long term and look at 
other methods of producing fertilizer, 
this doesn’t really fit with reducing 
prices for American families today. To 
do it and do it right, we really do need 
USDA on board. We need to have their 
input. We need to have their ability to 
do this through their programming.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1170, the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
SPANBERGER) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Virginia. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of my amendment to 
include the American Food Supply 
Chain Resiliency Act in H.R. 7606, the 
Lower Food and Fuel Cost Act. I thank 
Congressman ANTHONY
GONZALEZ
of 
Ohio for his partnership on this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
Supply chain disruptions are impact-
ing the operations of businesses in Vir-
ginia and across the country, leaving 
shelves empty and driving up prices for 
consumers. For crop and livestock pro-
ducers, as well as agribusinesses, the 
current disruptions are a threat to 
their livelihoods and their ability to 
deliver high-quality products at an af-
fordable price while still making ends 
meet. 
Meanwhile, Americans are suffering 
from rising food prices at grocery 
stores, dollar stores, and restaurants. 
Rising inflation makes trips to the gro-
cery store more and more stressful as 
the price of staple items like meat, 
eggs, and vegetables rise, sometimes 
going up monthly, even weekly. 
Americans have shared the experi-
ence of going to the grocery store—we 
all have—picking up our favorite food 
items that we have purchased for years 
and thinking, well, this is more expen-
sive than last week. My husband and I 
were just talking about this issue over 
the weekend as we changed our own 
shopping list because of it. 
Few products are more essential than 
the foods we eat. Farmers, particularly 
small- and medium-sized producers, 
have been left out of investments that 
are meant to mitigate supply chain 
challenges, and that has meant it is 
getting more difficult to get products 
from the farm to the market and, fi-
nally, to the table. 
While big companies have the budget 
to invest in supply chain innovations, 
research, and experts, small- and me-
dium-sized producers are paying higher 
prices than ever for fertilizer, fuel, 
shipping, and other input costs. 
When farmers pay more to produce 
food, all Americans pay more at the

grocery store. That is why we must 
empower USDA to do more to resolve 
farmers’ and food businesses’ supply 
chain challenges. We must be prepared. 
To address these concerns, I was 
proud to lead the bipartisan American 
Food Supply Chain Resiliency Act. 
This legislation would establish supply 
chain 
regional 
resource 
centers 
through cooperative agreements with 
the Agricultural Marketing Service at 
USDA. 
These resource centers would offer 
locally tailored coordination, technical 
assistance, and grants to small- and 
medium-sized 
producers 
and 
agri-
businesses, leading to stronger supply 
chains. This bill would also expand the 
great work of the Agriculture Innova-
tion Program to include research and 
support on supply chains. 
By establishing supply chain regional 
resource centers, this bill would pro-
vide additional support to family farm-
ers and food businesses trying to de-
liver their goods at a lower price for 
consumers. These centers would help 
local producers get through lean years, 
obtain the inputs they need, and ad-
dress challenges related to transpor-
tation costs, labor, and high energy 
prices. 
In fact, USDA has already taken 
similar steps to build collaboration 
across sectors of local and regional 
food supply chains through regional 
centers. 
Our 
bipartisan 
legislation 
would support and build on these cen-
ters, as well as make sure they are a 
wise, tailored investment with a clear 
mission and fair reporting require-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support our bipartisan bill. Once again, 
I thank Congressman GONZALEZ for his 
partnership. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the 
amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I express my appreciation 
to the gentlewoman from Virginia for 
bringing forth an idea, and I do wish 
the same courtesy had been extended 
to my Republican colleagues who were 
denied the opportunity to bring their 
amendments forward for debate. 
Working together is how the House 
Committee on Agriculture solves prob-
lems, and the committee has been 
working together with the Department 
to better understand this amendment, 
its purpose, and its implications. 
As the gentlewoman knows, this 
amendment was pulled from consider-
ation by my Democrat colleagues in a 
recent committee markup. Unfortu-
nately, we have not learned much since 
then, which furthers my opposition to 
it being considered prematurely on the 
floor today. 
I cannot support this amendment as 
written, an amendment that falls short 
of its advertised goals, and does not 
offer any immediate relief to farmers, 
ranchers, or consumers, because that is 
the myth that my Democrat friends 
are trying to sell with the overall bill 
today, which will not happen. In fact, I 
am afraid inflationary costs, more con-
centration, are going to occur as a re-
sult of a specific part of the package. 
Growing the size of government by 
codifying the Biden administration’s 
half-baked initiatives is no way to 
tackle rising inflation or address rising 
fuel and fertilizer costs. 
Even more perplexing is the idea that 
we would want to solidify in law con-
cepts that USDA admittedly has not 
developed into programming or policy. 
Now, we would have been better 
served 
by 
considering 
Republican 
amendments, all of which would have 
provided immediate relief through re-
versing the regulatory assault stifling 
innovation and exacerbating strained 
supply chains. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in opposing this amendment. I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
My colleague on the other side of the 
aisle mentioned that this bill will not 
provide immediate relief, and I concur. 
This bill is not meant to provide imme-
diate relief. The amendment before us 
would plan for the future and would 
recognize that we face disruptions in 
our supply chain, and frequently, when 
we do, it is our farmers and producers 
who are impacted, particularly smaller 
and medium-sized producers like those 
in our districts. 
This bill, this amendment to the 
larger bill, is an issue of planning for 
the 
future, 
recognizing 
disruptions 
that may come, and being able to 
proactively plan for such challenges. 
It is unfortunate that the gentleman 
feels that they were left out of the 
process, but I am heartened that the 
scope of concern relates to the process 
and not the underlying amendment. 
This amendment is about long-term 
planning. It is about ensuring that our 
smaller and medium-sized producers 
and agribusinesses have the technical 
assistance, the support, and the coordi-
nation that they will need to weather 
challenges in supply chain disruptions 
that may occur today, 10 years, 20 
years, 30 years into the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, to reiterate, in my com-
ments, I said it was premature, and I 
do believe it is. I think that this is a 
concept that the gentlewoman is pur-
suing that is worthy of consideration, 
worthy of development and full devel-
opment so that we can have an appro-
priate consideration of the text of this 
particular amendment. 
I also think it is out of place with 
this particular bill because the con-
text, the pretext that my Democratic 
friends are presenting here, is a false 
promise that whatever would pass, and 
if this would somehow find a pathway 
through the Senate and be imple-
mented, that it would immediately 
lower food and fuel costs. That is just 
not the case. 
This is more of a long-term vision. I 
appreciate that because I think we 
should be looking long term when it 
comes to the needs of input costs for 
our farmers because, quite frankly, 
when we have inflation, when we have 
burdensome regulations, when we have 
an administration that is really out of 
control from a regulatory perspective, 
sidelining their scientists at the EPA— 
which, by the way, actually, part of 
those are funded under a public-private 
partnership 
with 
agribusinesses 
to 
make sure that farmers can have ac-
cess to crop protection tools, signifi-
cant crop protection tools that have 
been sidelined by this administration, 
when these same scientists have found 
them to be safe in application in the 
past. 
What I would say is that I look for-
ward to working with the gentlewoman 
in the future on this concept, but I con-
tinue to remain in opposition. 
This is not quite ready for prime 
time, not ready for consideration. We 
need to be working more. We need 
more time working in a bipartisan way 
and, quite frankly, hearing from the 
administration as well and USDA. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1100 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
There is no disagreement that across 
America’s regions and across our com-
modities, our Nation’s farmers and 
ranchers have gotten the short end of 
the stick, particularly when it comes 
to rising input costs as a result of sup-
ply chain bottlenecks and inflation. 
The Lowering Food and Fuel Costs 
Act and this amendment take crucial, 
commonsense steps toward addressing 
these challenges, both now and into the 
future, planning for a future where we 
can be proactive, continually so, and 
ensure that small and targeted invest-
ments from USDA today can have im-
pacts on small- and medium-sized pro-
ducers’ ability to get food to market 
and improve their bottom lines. 
At the same time, these investments 
should also lead to lower food prices for 
Americans at the grocery store, con-
venience stores, and restaurants. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bipartisan amendment. I look forward 
to working with my colleague across 
the aisle to receive additional, very 
specific feedback on how we can make 
some of these provisions stronger, bet-
ter with that input into the future. 
Today, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the amendment in front of us 
and, ultimately, ‘‘yes’’ on the under-
lying bill, and I yield back the balance 
of my time.

a reporter. He has covered Capitol Hill 
since 1994, I believe, is the note I had. 
He is an excellent reporter. 
He reports the facts. He reports the 
truth. As I know Mr. SCALISE agrees, 
reporters who do that not only serve 
us, but more importantly, their major 
purpose is to serve the American peo-
ple because we know that a free press 
telling the facts and the truth to the 
American people give them the oppor-
tunity to make solid decisions for our 
democracy. 
I wish John Bresnahan a happy 60th 
birthday, and hope that he has many, 
many more. I have had 23 more than 
that, so I appreciate the fact that he is 
still going strong. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for the confession 
about how many 60th birthdays he has 
shared. Here is to many more for you, 
but also for Bres. 
As the gentleman points out, a fair 
and free press is vital to democracy. It 
is the First Amendment to our Con-
stitution: freedom of speech and free-
dom of the press. While they might not 
report our press releases verbatim all 
the time—as we might like them to— 
they serve a vital purpose. Bres is one 
of those that we see in the halls, like 
the press that is around here making 
sure that the country knows what is 
happening here in the greatest democ-
racy of the history of the world. 
As a 60th birthday gift to him, I 
promise not to sing ‘‘Happy Birthday’’ 
to him. I wish Bres a happy birthday, 
and I yield to the gentleman from 
Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want 
to tell Mr. Bresnahan that he made the 
same promise to me, which is why we 
did this. If he was going to sing it, I 
was a little reluctant to do this, and he 
didn’t. I join the whip in wishing John 
Bresnahan, a friend, a very careful and 
honest reporter, the very best 60th 
birthday and many more to come. 
Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the 
House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning 
hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business, 
with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning 
hour and 12 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
on 
Friday, 
the 
House will meet at 9 a.m. for legisla-
tive business. 
On Monday, we will be celebrating 
Juneteenth as a Federal holiday for the 
second 
time 
in 
American 
history. 
Juneteenth is the day on which the last 
slaves who were in Texas learned of 
their new status as free Americans, an 
extraordinary day in the history of our 
country, eliminating one of the great 
blights on the history of America. As 
de Tocqueville pointed out, we tried to 
heal our wounds and tried to heal our 
wrongs, and we are still working on 
that. 
Last year, the Congress took the his-
toric step of enacting legislation to 
recognize Juneteenth as a Federal holi-
day, at long last. I look forward to 
celebrating as we pay tribute to free-
dom to all men and women being cre-
ated equal in the image of God. We cel-
ebrate the history of the African-Amer-
ican perseverance and triumph over in-
justice and adversity. 
I say triumph—it has been a tri-
umph—but there are battles yet to be 
won. Juneteenth not only looks back 
but it looks forward to winning those 
battles. 
Madam Speaker, I see Mr. GREEN on 
the floor, who has a resolution on the 
recognition of the blight of slavery. I 
thank him for that resolution and look 
forward to having that considered. 
On Monday, we will be celebrating 
that holiday, but we will be celebrating 
it as we do Martin Luther King’s birth-
day, as we ought to be in celebrating 
Washington and Lincoln’s birthday, 
and committing ourselves to the real-
ization of the principles for which they 
stood. 
Madam Speaker, the House will con-
sider bills under suspension of the 
rules. The complete list of those sus-
pension bills will be announced at the 
close of business tomorrow. 
Next week, Madam Speaker, the 
House will consider H.R. 7666, which is 
titled 
Restoring 
Hope 
for 
Mental 
Health and Well-Being Act, a bipar-
tisan package of bills led by Chairman 
PALLONE and Ranking Member McMor-
ris Rodgers, to address the mental 
health and opioid abuse crisis. 
The legislation expands access to 
treatment for opioid use disorders, pro-
motes behavioral health integration, 
and reauthorizes critical programs to 
support mental health and substance 
use disorder, prevention, treatment, 
and recovery, including in our children. 
Madam Speaker, the House will also 
consider legislation under suspension 
from Chairman BOBBY SCOTT and mem-
bers of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee to address the mental health, 
addiction, and suicide on college cam-
puses, which is far, far too prevalent. 
Our young people have faced stresses 
by the pandemic, stresses within our 
Nation, the divisions on which prey on 
their minds, so this is a very important 
piece of legislation. I hope it will be— 
and I believe it is going to be—bipar-
tisan. 
The House will also take up H.R. 6411, 
the Veterans Affairs’ Committee Chair-
man MARK
TAKANO’s STRONG Vet-
erans Act, again, bipartisan legislation 
to combat veterans’ suicide and ad-
dress mental health, and help our Na-
tion meet its commitment to those 
who risk their lives and safety for our 
country. 
Additionally, Madam Speaker, the 
House will consider H.R. 5585, Rep-
resentatives Eshoo’s ARPA-H Act. This 
legislation would establish the Ad-
vanced Research Project Agency for 
Health, an independent agency tasked 
with accelerating biomedical innova-
tion and making transformative break-
throughs in the fight against the most 
challenging diseases confronting our 
people. 
This agency will oversee the next 
steps in the Cancer Moonshot program 
and help meet the President’s goal of 
cutting the cancer death rate by at 
least 50 percent over the next 25 years, 
and hopefully sooner. 
Madam Speaker, as we celebrate 
Pride Month, the House will consider 
H.R. 4176, the LGBTQ Data Inclusion 
Act. 
Madam Speaker, I anticipate that 
the House will vote on a compromised, 
bipartisan Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson Honoring Our PACT Act, 
after the Senate takes action on the 
version agreed upon in May. As the 
whip knows, that Act was a bipartisan 
act that dealt with those who were ex-
posed to burn pits and other toxic sub-
stances of which they did not know 
while they were serving on bases, both 
here and around the world. 
This bill, we believe the Senate will 
take action on, a version agreed upon 
in May, which preserves much of the 
House-passed legislation to care for 
veterans exposed to burn pits and other 
toxic chemicals during their service. 
In addition, the House will consider 
other bills under suspension of the 
rules, the complete list of suspension 
bills will be announced by the close of 
business tomorrow. Additional legisla-
tive items are possible. 
b 1215 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for that update. 
As we celebrate Juneteenth next week, 
also right here in this House Chamber 
over 150 years ago is where the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution was 
debated and passed. So history is made 
here on a regular basis. And then we 
celebrate the freedoms that result and 
continue as our Founders talked about 
to aspire towards a more perfect Na-
tion so we will do that next week. 
I do want to thank the gentleman be-
cause last week during this colloquy I 
know I asked my friend if we could 
bring the Supreme Court protection 
bill, the bill to make sure that Su-
preme Court Justices and their fami-
lies get proper protection, as we were 
watching and saw a man arrested for 
trying to murder a Supreme Court Jus-
tice. Leader MCCARTHY, I know, urged 
that as well. So I appreciate that we 
got to bring that bill up, debate it, and 
quickly pass it to President Biden’s 
desk where we can get that in place. 
I would hope that the Attorney Gen-
eral, Merrick Garland, would start en-
forcing 18 U.S. Code 1507 to give protec-
tion properly as Federal laws dictate, 
but it is not being enforced at the 
homes of those Justices. But, again, I 
appreciate that we got a very over-
whelming bipartisan vote on that bill 
this week. 
Does the gentleman have anything to 
add before we talk about the schedule 
for next week? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5634 
June 16, 2022 
I would simply observe, as I observed 
the other day, that we all want to 
make sure that our Justices are safe. 
Let me say, Madam Speaker, there is 
a very important reason for that. We 
want to keep all our people safe. But 
nine Justices of our Supreme Court 
represent that we are a nation of laws. 
They are one of the three branches of 
our government. Just as I was extraor-
dinarily and remain extraordinarily 
concerned about the attack on this in-
stitution, the Congress of the United 
States, as we were preparing to elect a 
President of the United States, an at-
tack on the Supreme Court and the 
lives of the Supreme Court Justices are 
an attack on our democracy, on a sepa-
rate branch of government that is 
charged with continuing to make us a 
nation of laws. 
So, very frankly, the Supreme Court 
Justices, under existing law, were pro-
tected. There were security people 
there. Luckily, there were security 
people there. But the gentleman is ab-
solutely right. We want to make sure 
whether we agree or disagree with the 
individuals, whether we agree or dis-
agree with the opinions or the judge-
ments that Congress makes, we are a 
nation of laws, and the way to resolve 
our differences is not through violence 
but through the democratic process. 
I thank the gentleman for his obser-
vation. 
Mr. SCALISE. I share those com-
ments by the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
As we look towards next week—we 
have had this conversation a number of 
times—one of the items I don’t see on 
the agenda is an item to address the 
problem of high gas prices, and, of 
course, we have now crossed an average 
of more than $5 a gallon. It is a major 
burden for families, especially lower- 
income families who are being forced 
more and more to make those tough 
decisions of can they even afford to 
drive to work, and can they even afford 
to drive to see their doctor or to drive 
to the grocery store where they are 
paying maybe 20 percent more for some 
of the food items. 
We have had a bill for over a month 
now, H.R. 6858, that would address 
these problems and allow us to actu-
ally have more control over our own 
energy production in America, to be 
able to drill in America for energy to 
lower the cost of gasoline, by con-
fronting so many of the problems that 
this Biden administration has imposed 
that are making it hard for us to 
produce more energy in America to the 
point where you now have President 
Biden announcing that he is going to 
go to Saudi Arabia to beg them to 
produce more oil. 
As we try to confront this chal-
lenge—and again, H.R. 6858 would allow 
us to do that—if you look at President 
Biden’s proposed trip to Saudi Arabia, 
the President likes talking a lot about 
carbon footprints, carbon emissions, 
and global warming. 
Why would the President get on Air 
Force One and fly 5,700 miles to Saudi 
Arabia to beg them to do something 
that we can do right here in America? 
In fact, he could go less than 1,000 
miles to Port Fourchon, Louisiana, in 
my district where they can produce 
hundreds of thousands of barrels a day 
in America which, by the way, because 
America has the best standards in the 
world, would emit less carbon than the 
oil produced in Saudi Arabia. 
While the President will be flying 
over to Saudi Arabia, he won’t know 
the answer he is going to get. They are 
an OPEC nation. They typically sup-
port a limited supply of oil because 
they want a higher price. So he doesn’t 
know what the answer is going to be. 
He is going to fly 5,700 miles over and 
another 5,700 miles back to the United 
States. There are no solar panels on 
Air Force One, so that is going to be a 
lot of jet fuel and a lot of carbon emis-
sions to do something that he could 
pick up the phone and call Port 
Fourchon. We would love to see him 
down there, but he can call them. I can 
tell you, Madam Speaker, the answer 
would be ‘‘yes.’’ 
They would say: Yes, we will produce 
more energy here in America. 
But they are not allowed to right 
now because of limitations put in place 
by the Biden administration. So while 
we push to get this bill, H.R. 6858, 
brought forward, it really begs the 
question of first: What is the carbon 
footprint of President Biden’s trip to 
Saudi Arabia? 
But why even do this trip? Why go to 
Saudi Arabia and ask them to produce 
oil when we have it right here? 
It is President Biden’s policies that 
are stopping that oil from being pro-
duced, and, by the way, at a much 
lower carbon footprint than anything 
that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela, 
or 
any 
of 
those 
countries 
would 
produce if it were their countries meet-
ing the demands of our Nation and so 
many others. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman, hopefully, to see if we can get 
the bill scheduled for next week. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
We continue to talk about this as if 
this were the President’s fault. First of 
all, in a much wider range, this is a re-
sult of the pandemic. 
Why is it the result of the pandemic? 
Not solely the pandemic but let me 
take the pandemic first. Everybody 
stayed home—this body and businesses 
across America. 
What did that mean that they stayed 
home? 
They stopped buying gas. 
What did the oil companies do? 
They shut down some of their pro-
duction, a very substantial reduction 
in production. But then as the prices 
went up, they were making as much 
money or much more money. So in 
making much more money, they didn’t 
increase production, as the gentleman 
says will be an answer to the question, 
in a country that does, in fact, have 
regulations and does have rules, and 
because of those regulations and rules 
the production of our energy is, in fact, 
as the gentleman asserts, more effi-
cient and more environmentally con-
siderate. 
The oil companies—acting from what 
they thought was good business prac-
tice, demand was down, but prices were 
going up—were making profits. They 
bought back stock, which, of course, 
increased the value of the stock that 
remained. They increased dividends, 
which, of course, encouraged people to 
invest in them. It made people happy 
about their investments. 
But they didn’t increase production. 
They didn’t have to increase produc-
tion. They were making good profits 
and making, from their standpoint, 
good business decisions. 
As I indicated in the last colloquy 
that we dealt with this problem, there 
were millions of leases put on the mar-
ket by this administration, as I recall, 
some 80 million acres. Approximately 2 
percent of the leases were bid on, and 
then the Court said that this was not a 
legal process. 
But it is interesting how small was 
the interest in additional production at 
that time irrespective of what hap-
pened subsequently. 
The gentleman mentions a bill, as he 
has done in the past, H.R. 6858, the 
American Energy Independence from 
Russia Act. 
But before I say that, let me say, I 
hope the President is going to Saudi 
Arabia to talk privately, not publicly 
trying to embarrass or harangue, and 
certainly not to beg. The United States 
of America doesn’t need to beg any na-
tion in the world, and this President is 
not begging anybody. 
This President should say, however, 
Madam Speaker: Saudis, stop control-
ling the supply unreasonably and driv-
ing the prices up of your product. 
Yes, they are making more money, 
and they have a cartel. That is called a 
monopoly. That cartel has made sure 
that the lack of supply drove up the 
international market price. And then 
Russia went to war. 
Now, Russia going to war has af-
fected to some degree the supply of oil, 
but, very frankly, buying Russian oil 
supports their criminal war effort, 
their vicious and murderous war effort. 
We are all against that. So we agreed 
that we would not take any oil, and we 
urged our European allies not to rely 
on it either. 
Now, what did that create? 
It created a lack of confidence in the 
stability of the market. 
What happens when you have lack of 
confidence in the stability of a mar-
ket? 
Prices go up because it is a bet on 
what is going to happen with the price 
of that product in the future that the 
market really reflects. 
Now, the reason I say it that way is 
because these are not Biden prices. 
Even if tomorrow we snapped a finger 
and said: ‘‘Okay, go ahead,’’ nothing 
would happen tomorrow, nothing would

happen next week, and nothing would 
happen next month. It would take a 
substantial period of time because the 
oil companies, based upon the lack of 
demand, shut down, nor did they pur-
sue further production. 
Now, let me say something about the 
price of oil. The national price of oil 
now does not reflect the increase as 
part of the market response to what is 
called the West Texas Intermediary, 
which I am sure the gentleman from 
Louisiana, 
an 
oil-producing 
State, 
knows much more about than I do. 
But let me say this: In 2008, that 
benchmark for crude oil peaked at 
$147.02 in July of 2008. Adjusted for in-
flation, that is $199.57 today. 
In that time, 2008, the average U.S. 
gasoline peaked at $4.14 per gallon. Ad-
justed for inflation, that would be $5.62 
today. 
So, in other words, in 2008, otherwise 
known as the last year of the Bush ad-
ministration, 
gasoline 
prices 
were 
higher than they are today notwith-
standing the fact that the world price 
was $31 less. 
Excuse me, yesterday, June 15, that 
West 
Texas 
Intermediary 
oil—the 
benchmark for crude oil prices—was 
$116 a barrel, $31 less, without account-
ing for inflation, which would make it 
greater than it was in 2008. That wasn’t 
George Bush’s fault. It was the inter-
national market’s fault and also this 
cartel that controls a large part of the 
supply of the oil in our country. 
Now, my point—I still have to deal 
with H.R. 6858. One of its tenets is to 
approve the Keystone pipeline. The 
problem with that is, for whatever rea-
son—and I understand my friend will 
have a response, Madam Speaker, as to 
well, because you disapproved it, mean-
ing the Obama administration. They 
want to open the Keystone pipeline. 
The problem is the company that had 
the Keystone pipeline has abandoned 
it. Even if it were approved, they would 
have to get back in business and we 
would be well over a year—well over a 
year. 
Now, I happen to have agreed that we 
should have approved that pipeline. I 
have said that publicly. I said that to 
the press. That didn’t happen. But it 
would not solve the problem. And par-
ticularly, when you look at the figures 
that I just gave with respect to the 
world market price, we are paying a lot 
more now than we did in 2008 when it 
was higher. 
So I would say to my friend, he also 
had a provision that expedites the LNG 
facility approval process. One of the 
problems we had is 20 percent of the 
LNG export capacity is now shut down. 
b 1230 
It was shut down because the regula-
tions that the gentleman speaks of, 
correctly, were not followed, and the 
LNG plant had an explosion. It shut 
down because it violated regulations 
that were imposed upon it. 
What I would say to my friend—I 
have talked to the committee about his 
bill. The LNG process is working. As I 
told him, I have an LNG export plant 
in my district, which has changed from 
substantial exports to the Pacific re-
gion, and now, 80 percent is going to 
Europe to try to bridge that gap as the 
Europeans retreat from being depend-
ent upon Russian oil. 
I tell my friend, with all due re-
spect—and I am not going to plead 
with him, but I am going to suggest to 
him—we are going to Saudi Arabia, I 
hope, to tell them in private: Look, 
this is not a game you want to be play-
ing. You are making our consumers 
pay far more. 
We have acted. We acted, and we 
passed, some time ago, a bill that said 
you cannot have gas prices that are set 
at unreasonable levels, which we know 
as gouging. It is like you have a flood 
in your city and 80 percent of the gro-
cery stores are wiped out, and the gro-
cery stores that remain triple their 
prices. That is called gouging. We 
passed that bill. 
We also passed a bill today which, 
unfortunately, most Republicans voted 
against—‘‘most,’’ I say, not all—which 
will, again, seek to bring the price 
down at the pump. How? By utilizing 
American products to supplement and 
expand the supply of gas and, we be-
lieve, bring the price of a gallon down 
some 40 cents—that is what the experts 
say—if we continue to use a mix of 
fuel. 
But let me say in closing, on these 
remarks, which I know have been rel-
atively lengthy, we are in this to-
gether, Republicans and Democrats. 
FOX News criticized me for saying 
we are at war. We just sent a billion 
dollars for a war we are not in because 
we believe in freedom. We believe in 
international law. 
We believe that we have a dictator, a 
dangerous dictator, who is committing 
war crimes through his men and 
women in eastern Ukraine in par-
ticular and did it in western Ukraine as 
they came into Kyiv. 
We are in this together, one Nation, 
one America, on behalf of freedom. We 
have taken tough action. As part of 
that, we are paying the price at the 
pump because of that invasion. 
The pandemic shut down production 
and shut down the purchase of gasoline 
by people because they didn’t go to 
work. They didn’t need to get in their 
cars. They didn’t need to commute. 
I would simply say to my friend that 
we are on the same team. Our Presi-
dent is leading our effort to defeat this 
despot, to stop this war, to ensure the 
freedom not only of the Ukrainian peo-
ple but of all people, and to ensure that 
we respect international law. 
I looked at the gentleman’s bill. I 
would be glad to talk about other 
ways, including maybe some of the 
things that are in his bill. But I will 
tell the gentleman, the first couple 
that I looked at, the Keystone pipeline 
is not going to be reopened. The gen-
tleman and I may lament that as a pol-
icy because I was publicly, during the 
Obama administration, for the ap-
proval of that pipeline. So, I am pre-
pared to work with the gentleman to 
see what we can do. 
But we have done today’s bill. It may 
not be perfect. It may not work. But it 
is certainly worth a try, to try to bring 
these awful prices down at the pump 
because I know all of our constituents, 
whether they live in Louisiana or 
Maryland, are struggling because they 
have to use their cars. They have to 
use that gasoline. They don’t have an 
alternative. And they don’t have an al-
ternative to buying food. 
Both of those are tough, and we need 
to act together to try to see if we can 
solve that problem in the context of an 
extraordinary 
pandemic, 
a 
historic 
pandemic that shut down the world, 
and we are just trying to get back. 
We are trying to get supply chains 
going, including gasoline pipelines, 
which is why the President is going to 
Saudi Arabia, not to beg, but to assert 
the economic fact of the ramifications 
of the cartels stifling supply. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, if 
there is common ground we can find on 
the components of H.R. 6858, I would be 
happy to help facilitate that negotia-
tion because there are a number of 
very specific items in that bill that ad-
dress the shortfalls, the deficiencies, 
the inabilities to produce energy in 
America. The Keystone pipeline might 
be one of the more well known. 
President Biden, on his first day in 
office, canceled the Keystone pipeline. 
Of course, it is not moving forward 
because he canceled it. It would pro-
vide a vital supply of oil from our 
friends in Canada that we wouldn’t 
need from other people. 
But there are a number of other pipe-
line issues. No new pipelines have been 
approved in the country. You have to 
have an ability to move energy around 
the country if we are going to be able 
to produce our own. 
If a conscious decision was made in 
the White House that they don’t want 
any pipelines, because that impedes the 
ability to produce energy in America, 
it just means we have to import more 
of it from other countries. Whether it 
is Saudi Arabia, Russia, any of them 
that I would not want us to have to get 
it from, it is going to come in some 
form. It might be a tanker. It is going 
to get here, and it is going to have to 
be put on rail or an 18-wheeler if it 
can’t be put in a pipeline. 
Let’s get more pipelines produced, 
LNG export facilities. There are mul-
tiple, at least four, LNG export facili-
ties that are sitting on the desk over at 
the Department of Energy ready to go. 
These are multibillion-dollar, privately 
funded projects that can’t move for-
ward because they won’t move, yes or 
no, on those requests that have been 
pending for over a year. 
Obviously, you look at leases, not 
being able to develop your lease. If you 
are a farmer and you own land, you 
could talk about all the thousands of 
acres of land, but if you need a permit

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5636 
June 16, 2022 
from the Federal Government to plant 
food 
and 
the 
Federal 
Government 
won’t give you a permit to plant the 
food, then you can’t use the land. The 
land is worthless. 
You own leases on Federal or State 
lands, but the Federal Government, 
through President Biden, said you 
can’t get permits to go and exercise 
that lease. Then the lease is worthless. 
There has been a lot of talk by the 
White House about who to blame. By 
the way, I have never heard of Presi-
dent Biden pointing the finger at him-
self or looking in the mirror and going, 
is there something I can do? We have a 
list for him that he can do, and he 
won’t. 
But Joe Biden, as a candidate for 
President, has said things like this 
multiple times since being President: 
‘‘No more drilling on Federal lands. No 
more drilling, including offshore. No 
ability for the oil industry to continue 
to drill, period.’’ That was Joe Biden. 
Then, Joe Biden continued to carry 
out policies that followed through on 
those promises to kill drilling in Amer-
ica, and each step of the way, the price 
kept going up. 
Prior to Putin’s invasion—I know the 
President loves trying to blame Putin. 
Well in advance of Putin’s invasion, 
the price of oil was going up. In fact, 
the President was—whatever termi-
nology you want to use—pleading with, 
begging, asking Putin to produce more 
oil prior to the invasion of Ukraine. 
That was who Joe Biden was asking 
back then as he was carrying out his 
promise, ‘‘No ability for the oil indus-
try to continue to drill, period.’’ 
He only applied that, by the way, to 
America. He was asking other coun-
tries to drill. He was just saying you 
can’t do it here. Putin said no, by the 
way. 
In the meantime, Putin was making 
$700 million a day selling his oil to 
America and Europe during that period 
when President Biden was carrying out 
all the steps to stop drilling in Amer-
ica. 
Then you fast forward. The price 
keeps going up. President Biden, again, 
doesn’t look in the mirror. 
The 
gentleman 
mentioned 
they 
blamed the pandemic. That didn’t fly 
because that wasn’t the case because 
people started getting out again, start-
ed going again. 
Energy companies asked to start pro-
ducing again and filed permit after per-
mit application and got denied and de-
nied and denied, so then the President 
blamed the oil and gas companies. 
They had hearings up here, brought in 
all the oil and gas companies. 
Do you know what the oil and gas 
companies said under oath? They want 
to drill more, and they can’t drill be-
cause of President Biden’s policies. It 
is President Biden’s policies stopping 
them from drilling. 
Again, if the oil and gas companies or 
Putin were the reason that there was 
this inability, and President Biden, as 
he has done multiple times, blamed 
them, if they were the reason that they 
had this shortfall, he would continue to 
be blaming them. But he knew the pub-
lic wasn’t buying it because it wasn’t 
them, so he just blames more people. 
Then, he goes to price gouging. As 
the gentleman pointed out, there was a 
bill here on the House floor a few 
weeks ago to try to shift the blame 
over to price gouging, and the answer 
was to allow you to sue your local gas 
station if you didn’t like the price of 
gas. 
Well, none of us like the price of gas. 
Suing your gas station is only going to 
make the price higher. Obviously, that 
had no impact because that wasn’t the 
reason. But that was the answer and 
the attempt to try to blame somebody 
else. 
Then we moved forward, and it is all 
of these other issues—refineries. This 
week, the White House started blaming 
refineries. 
While the White House keeps throw-
ing spaghetti at the wall, trying to fig-
ure out if somebody else will take the 
blame, he is going to go to Saudi and 
ask them to help us lower the price. 
Saudi’s ability to produce is irrelevant 
to the price if we produce in America 
because we have the ability to drive 
down that price because we are not an 
OPEC nation. We are not a monopoly. 
We are a free-market economy when 
the free market is allowed to operate. 
But President Biden, through his 
promises—‘‘No ability for the oil indus-
try to continue to drill, period’’—in es-
sence, he took the free market ability 
for America to produce energy off the 
table, which means he gave that lever-
age to monopolies, to cartels. They are 
taking advantage of it because Presi-
dent Biden gave them that. 
Instead of asking them to produce 
more when they are fine with the high 
price of oil, whether it is Brent, West 
Texas, it doesn’t matter what it is. He 
has taken it off in America so that 
they can limit the supply. 
Let’s not limit the supply. Again, if 
it is about saving the planet, if it is 
about 
carbon 
emissions, 
why 
not 
produce more here? There is no coun-
try in the world that produces oil that 
does it cleaner or better than us. 
If you take America off the table, as 
President Biden has done—‘‘No more 
drilling on Federal lands. No more 
drilling, including offshore.’’ That was 
Joe Biden. He took it off the table 
here. That means you are going to need 
oil from countries that emit more car-
bon to produce the same oil, so you get 
higher carbon emissions. 
Again, that doesn’t even count the 
carbon emissions that will occur when 
President Biden gets on Air Force One 
and flies over 5,700 miles to go have 
this conversation that he doesn’t need 
to have because he can have that con-
versation right here in America at a 
place like Port Fourchon, where the 
answer would be yes, and it would be 
cleaner. And by the way, it would bring 
billions more dollars into America’s 
Treasury. It would lower the price of 
gasoline. It would create more jobs in 
America. 
Every answer says yes, except Presi-
dent Biden keeps saying no. We want 
to address it through this legislation, 
which would counter some of those 
many things that President Biden has 
done to turn off the spigots in America. 
If we can work on ways to confront 
this, I would be more than happy to 
have that negotiation, and we could go 
through, offline, how to do that. That 
is why I continue to bring up this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for all of that in-
formation. 
It continues to befuddle me why our 
Republican friends would much prefer 
to blame President Biden and so avoid 
placing blame on Mr. Trump’s friend, 
Mr. Putin. I don’t understand that, 
Madam Speaker. It is not a nation indi-
visible. 
Now, Madam Speaker, I used a sta-
tistic some weeks ago that I have 
heard not at all disputed. The Biden 
administration 
has 
approved 
more 
drilling permits on public land in 2021, 
in 1 year, than the Trump administra-
tion did each year during its first 3 
years in office. 
b 1245 
Not compared to the combined 3 
years, just compared to each individual 
year. Number one. 
Number two: Domestic oil production 
is greater today than it was under 
Trump. Not a whole big difference, 
10,968 versus 11,185, but nevertheless, it 
speaks to the fact that the representa-
tion that somehow Biden has shut 
down the industry, and therefore, he is 
to blame. 
We don’t want to talk about the pan-
demic that shut down oil production. 
In Trump’s last year—in Trump’s last 
year—refineries in the U.S. reduced 
their capacity by more than 800,000 
barrels. So, under the Trump adminis-
tration, production was decreased. 
Maybe they will look at the records 
and see whether or not that representa-
tion is accurate, and if it is not, I stand 
to be corrected. But those are the fig-
ures I have. 
I notice that my friend did not re-
spond to my representation that prices 
were higher under George Bush in 2008 
than they are today. Now, because of 
inflation, the number is different, and 
compared to the world price, prices are 
higher. 
So, I will say to my friend, we had at 
least 80 million acres, 2.5 million 
taken. As the gentleman pointed out 
before, the court said, No, that wasn’t 
legal, so it was never effected. But we 
have those 800,000 that are not back on-
line. 
Don’t blame them, though. Don’t 
blame Putin. Don’t blame the pan-
demic. Politically, let’s blame Biden. 
Now, I’m not sure why Bush had the 
higher price. Maybe it was that he was 
shutting down the oil business, the 
President from Texas. Maybe.

June 16, 2022 
But there is more today being pro-
duced. Not by enough. Still, there are 
800,000 barrels shut down. That is per 
day, by the way; not just 800,000—per 
day. 
So we can argue back and forth on 
this. We are passing legislation. Our 
Republican friends, for the most part, 
voted against it. It won’t work. It 
won’t do. 
I don’t know whether they are right 
or wrong, but it is worth trying. It is 
worth trying because our consumers 
are hurting. 
People at the grocery store—I go to 
the 
grocery 
store 
every 
weekend, 
Madam Speaker. I live alone. I don’t 
buy a lot of groceries because they will 
go bad, so I go every weekend. 
I see the shelves that are empty. I see 
the price of bacon has gone up now 
over $10. I see the price of the eggs I 
get, the price of the half and half I buy, 
or the orange juice I buy. It is going 
up. 
I am in the fortunate position where 
I can pay for it without it binding me 
someplace else. But I know that a 
whole lot of people that I see shopping, 
they have got that list out, and they 
are very worried about their costs. 
I don’t know whether this bill we just 
passed is going to solve that—cer-
tainly, not overnight. I don’t know 
whether a month from now it will help 
somewhat, 5 cents or 10 cents on a 
pound of bacon or a dozen eggs. 
I don’t know that, but it was worth a 
try, and we passed this bill. We got 
some Republican support, including, I 
think, the ranking member of the com-
mittee that reported the bill out. 
We are not technically at war, but we 
are spending a lot of money on behalf 
of freedom, and we ought to be to-
gether. We ought not to be carping 
about our President who is doing ev-
erything he can think of to try to get 
a handle on this, both on inflation, on 
the cost to consumers, and on the sup-
ply of a product that we all need. 
So, I would simply make a request 
that let’s work together to try to get 
this problem solved. Saudi Arabia is 
not the answer, but it is part of the an-
swer. The cartel is part of the answer. 
The Russians are part of the answer. 
Maybe none of them are the entire 
answer. But when you understand that 
this administration has given more 
leases on public land than the prior ad-
ministration did in its first 3 years, it 
is hard to say that this administration 
is the reason for this. Other than po-
litically, it is a very salient argument, 
but that is all it is. 
Mr. SCALISE. Just for clarification, 
the ranking member voted ‘‘no’’ on the 
bill. 
Mr. HOYER. Oh, okay. Sorry. 
Mr. SCALISE. The 800,000 leases—and 
I know we talked about this before. 
You can have 800,000 leases, but when 
you need, then, permits to actually uti-
lize the lease—so you have a lease to go 
and develop oil, but you need to drill. 
You need to do seismic. You need to 
build pipelines, infrastructure to move 
it. If you don’t get those permits to ac-
tually utilize the leases, the leases are 
worthless. That is what H.R. 6858 ad-
dresses. We have been raising that 
issue for a long time. The lease is no 
good if you can’t, then, use the lease. 
Mr. HOYER. Would the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. What I said was, in 
Trump’s last year, refineries in the 
U.S. reduced their capacity by more 
than 800,000 barrels. That didn’t have 
anything to do about leases. 
That had to do with an economic de-
cision, which probably made sense be-
cause what happened is the economy 
was contracting. 
Madam Speaker, 2.8 million net jobs 
were lost during the 4 years of Trump, 
and 8.7 million have been gained. 
As they have been gaining, people are 
getting back in their cars. They are 
getting back and driving. They are 
spending on the economy. But what 
happened? 
The pandemic had shut down supply 
lines. And the oil companies, ration-
ally, when demand went down, they re-
duced capacity. They don’t need a new 
lease to go back up to the 800,000. They 
were doing it under the present author-
ization that they have. 
That was my point. It continues to be 
my point. The companies have made a 
decision and they are not moving 
ahead rapidly to try to get more pro-
duction. 
One of the reasons is—I get it—they 
are making a lot of money. Some oil 
companies have got 300 percent greater 
profits now than they had some years 
ago. 300 percent. 
So, why do we need to do more prod-
uct? We are making great money. 
Chevron says it had the most success-
ful year in 2021 than it has ever had. It 
may be another oil company. I may be 
wrong on that. 
Was it Chevron? I am asking some-
body who probably knows the answer 
better than me. One of the oil compa-
nies reported that. 
I am not criticizing them for that. 
What I am saying is, this is a multi-
faceted challenge that confronts us, 
and we ought to address it in a way 
that it deserves, and that is in a bipar-
tisan way that will have effect. 
I am going to work with the gen-
tleman. As I said, I was for Keystone. I 
was not for shutting Keystone down. I 
was approving it to go ahead. I thought 
it made sense. Our friends in Canada 
have an extraordinary supply. 
As the gentleman observes, though— 
interestingly, because I think many of 
your colleagues oppose those rules and 
regulations—it is cleaner. It is better 
for the environment to produce it here. 
Why? Because we adopted regula-
tions—either the administration adopt-
ed or we passed them in legislation, 
and very frankly, I think that many of 
those were opposed by—I don’t know 
whether you, but many in your party, 
so it is better to do it here. 
So I don’t want to dispute that, but 
it is also necessary to have production, 
particularly among the cartel coun-
tries, and Russia has no interest—Rus-
sia has an interest in additional pro-
duction. 
Why? Because that is how they are 
funding this war. But we ought to 
spend time on criticizing Putin and his 
war and the crimes that are being com-
mitted in his name in Ukraine, and our 
determination 
to 
make 
sure 
the 
Ukrainian people who have displayed 
extraordinary courage, and Zelenskyy, 
who has displayed extraordinary lead-
ership, make sure they know that we 
are focused on them. And we are fo-
cused against Putin, not our own Presi-
dent, any more than I did when, you 
know, George Bush was President. 
Very frankly, I supported, as the gen-
tleman probably knows, the trade bills. 
I thought it was good to do business. A 
lot of our people didn’t support him on 
that. I supported him on that. 
So I think we need to be not so crit-
ical of our President. We have one 
President at a time. We had a pan-
demic. It wasn’t on his watch we got a 
pandemic. It was on his watch that we 
got a handle on the pandemic. 
On his watch, he has been giving 
more access to public lands than his 
predecessor did. We can debate the nu-
ances of differences, but we ought to 
focus on why we have this crisis. 
The gentleman knows these prices in 
many ways reflect the confidence and 
the stability, or the lack of confidence 
and the lack of stability in the market, 
and the war directly relates to that 
issue. 
Mr. SCALISE. Obviously, we will 
continue to debate this. Hopefully, we 
will debate it over H.R. 6858 where we 
can actually be talking about how we 
work together to solve the problem. 
Of course, as the gentleman knows, 
Congress did come together, Repub-
licans and Democrats, to give our 
friends in Ukraine the tools to go and 
push Putin out of much of Ukraine 
and, hopefully, all of Ukraine. 
We will continue to stand with the 
incredibly strong, resilient people of 
Ukraine in standing up to Vladimir 
Putin. 
We will, hopefully, have this debate 
further as we are talking about the leg-
islation that we would like to bring. 
Unless the gentleman has anything 
else—Madam Speaker, I yield back the 
balance of my time.

signing of the Emancipation Proclama-
tion. 
Now, 
my 
great-grandmother 
and 
many of my ancestors were born during 
slavery in Galveston, Texas. My grand-
father was born in 1867 in Galveston, 
Texas. So this day has always symbol-
ized a time for me personally, as well 
as for many African Americans; a time 
for reflection, as well as a recommit-
ment to justice. 
Each year, Juneteenth compels us to 
confront the darkest moments in our 
Nation’s history, a chapter that was 
born in the Middle Passage, continued 
through slavery, and manifests itself 
today through systemic racism. 
We must acknowledge the legacy of 
slavery and systemic racism that con-
tinues 
today 
in 
education 
and 
healthcare and a broken criminal jus-
tice system. I could go on and on. 
It is also at the heart of the crises 
facing our Nation today, including eco-
nomic injustice and hate-fueled vio-
lence. 
As we recognize this important day 
in history, it is also crucial that we 
pass Congresswoman SHEILA JACKSON 
LEE’s H.R. 40 legislation to develop a 
commission on reparations and recom-
mit to an agenda for Black America 
that realizes true equity and justice.

APOLOGIES TO BORDER PATROL 
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to comment on the recent 
developments regarding those brave 
Border Patrol officers who used their 
reins to prevent people sneaking into a 
country illegally, prevent them from 
getting stomped under their horses’ 
hooves. 
I have been to the border several 
times. Uniformly, all the Border Patrol 
felt 
those 
people 
behaved 
appro-
priately, and I think continuous stud-
ies have shown they behaved appro-
priately. But sadly, President Biden 
has decided to pick them out for pun-
ishment. 
It reminds me when he calls the po-
lice of this country racist—both com-
pletely unfounded. He only does it, I 
think, to divide our country, create di-
visions here. 
I would demand that President Biden 
apologize to the brave Border Patrol, 
those great guys or gals who, on that 
day, prevented the Haitians trying to 
slip into this country from getting 
stomped underfoot. 
I would also like him to apologize to 
the police of this country who are not 
racist and are doing a great job to try 
to hold down our murder rate.

RISING PRICES HIT LOW-INCOME 
FAMILIES HARDEST 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Madam Speak-
er, rising prices at the pump and at the 
supermarket are costing families more 
each month, and higher prices are fall-
ing hardest on low-income families, 
who spend a larger share of their budg-
et on food and gas. 
Since the beginning of the year, gas 
prices have increased by nearly $2. No 
doubt, this is in part due to Putin’s war 
in Ukraine, but it is also driven by oil 
and gas companies raising prices on 
consumers. 
Last month, the House passed the 
Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act to 
institute the first Federal law against 
profiteering by oil and gas companies. 
Today, 
the 
House 
considered 
and 
passed legislation to make cheaper and 
cleaner ethanol blends more available. 
These commonsense measures would 
get gas prices under control and put 
money back in families’ pockets.

HONORING FRANK BUCKLES 
(Mr. MOONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
MOONEY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today I rise to share the story of an 
American patriot from Charles Town, 
West Virginia, which is where I live. 
Corporal Frank Buckles lived to be 
110 years old. He died in 2011 and was 
America’s last known World War I vet-
eran. Buckles had enlisted in the Army 
by giving his age as 18 rather than his 
actual age of 16. He drove an Army am-
bulance in France in 1918 and came to 
symbolize a generation of embattled 
young Americans as the last of the 
World War I doughboys. 
Buckles later spent 3 years as a Japa-
nese prisoner of war during World War 
II after being captured in the Pacific 
while serving as a U.S. contractor. 
Buckles lived on a 330-acre West Vir-
ginia cattle farm, where he drove a 
tractor until 102 years old. I am hon-
ored to introduce legislation to des-
ignate the United States Postal Serv-
ice located in Charles Town, West Vir-
ginia, as the ‘‘Corporal Frank Buckles 
Post Office.’’ He was a true patriot and 
is most deserving of this honor in the 
town he called home for 50 years. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
MIKE SMITH 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of Mike 
Smith, who was truly a pillar in the 
Fort Worth community. At 78 years 
old, Mike was a loving husband, father, 
grandfather, and was known as the un-
official mayor of Magnolia Avenue in 
Fort Worth. 
Throughout his 55-year tenure, Mike 
baked over half a million pies, which 
put his restaurant, the Paris Coffee 
Shop, on the map. His pies were listed 
in USA Today, Bon Appetit magazine, 
and really known all around the world, 
but what really made Mike so special 
was the warmth and love that he 
showed everyone that walked into his 
coffee shop. 
It didn’t matter if you were from 
Rivercrest or Riverside. It didn’t mat-
ter if you were from Whitehall Street 
in Eastwood in Fort Worth or if you 
were from Westover Hills, Mike made 
everyone feel welcome any time you 
came into the Paris Coffee Shop. His 
firm handshake, his hugs, his conversa-
tions were just absolutely unforget-
table, and he will be deeply missed. 
Just in addition to everything that 
he has done for the food community, 
the restaurant community in Fort 
Worth, we send prayers out to his en-
tire network of friends and family.

CONGRATULATING RUSSELL 
COUNTY BASEBALL 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize the Russell County High 
School baseball team, the Kentucky 
State High School runners-up. Their 
head coach, David Rexroat, has led the 
Lakers baseball team since 2002. He is 
the all-time winningest baseball coach 
at Russell County, and he was recently 
inducted 
into 
the 
Kentucky 
High 
School Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. 
Russell County began their journey 
to the State tournament by winning 
the 16th District baseball tournament, 
which includes my home school of 
Monroe County. They have won the 
16th District 9 of the last 10 years. 
They won the region, the 4th Region in 
Bowling Green, and went on to Louis-
ville to the State. They made it all the 
way to the State finals, to the State 
championship game. 
The Russell County Lakers baseball 
team had nine seniors on that team 
that had played together most of their 
lives. They finished the season 31–7, the 
most wins in Russell County school 
history. 
Madam Speaker, that State cham-
pionship game was in Louisville, Ken-
tucky, against St. Xavier, which is one 
of the largest high schools in the State. 
It is about a 21⁄2 hour drive from Rus-
sell County to Louisville. Ninety-five 
percent of the crowd was from the 
small county of Russell County. This 
community is proud of this baseball 
team and their great accomplishment. 
I commend them for a tremendous 
baseball season.

Day Resolution. I thank my cosponsors 
and those who recognize this important 
Federal holiday. 
H. 
Res. 
1182 
is 
to 
celebrate 
Juneteenth, but I was pleased to be the 
first Member of Congress, after years of 
introducing resolutions, to introduce 
the actual language of the Federal hol-
iday signed by President Biden on June 
17, 2021. 
What is Juneteenth? It is a recogni-
tion of one of America’s original sins, 
the slaves that were held over 200 
years, and the brutality that they ex-
perienced but the freedom they experi-
enced on June 19, 1865. 
We can come together as a Nation to 
celebrate 
freedom 
in 
many, 
many 
ways. I am delighted that over the 
weekend in Houston and Galveston, we 
will be lifting up our voices of celebra-
tion, but we know that there are next 
steps. 
As I have been introducing the reso-
lution on Juneteenth, I also commend 
my colleagues to move forward on H.R. 
40, the Commission to Study and De-
velop Reparation Proposals for African 
Americans Act. Again, what are rep-
arations? It is healing, it is restora-
tion, it is repair. We look forward to 
responding to the indicia in African- 
American communities that should be 
fixed. 
Happy 
Juneteenth, 
America. 
Let’s celebrate together. 
f 
AMERICA’S ASTRONOMICAL 
NATIONAL DEBT 
(Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
our current national debt is not only 
huge, it is astronomical. As of today, 
the national debt exceeds over $30 tril-
lion. To put that in perspective, that 
amount in $100 bills laid side by side 
would circle the Earth over 1,167 times. 
If stacked, it would reach the Inter-
national Space Station 80 times. 
The debt crisis is truly out of this 
world, and yet my colleagues across 
the aisle would rather spend even more 
money on unnecessary programs with 
unrealistic goals. Effects of the debt 
are already being felt in the form of 
record-high inflation and gas prices, 
but perhaps the greatest tragedy is 
that it will be our children and our 
children’s children who will ultimately 
foot the bill. 
f 
RACIAL JUSTICE IN AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And I rise today 
with an expression of gratitude and 
great appreciation. 
I thank the many persons who voted 
for H.R. 2543, the Financial Services 
Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Eco-
nomic Justice Act. I rise to thank per-
sons for this because I was fortunate 
enough to have the opportunity to 
manage the bill on the floor. 
The Honorable MAXINE WATERS is the 
sponsor of this piece of legislation. It is 
a compilation of some 13 bills that 
were used and packaged so that we 
could bring about some racial justice 
in this country. Racial justice that is 
long overdue, I might add. 
The Honorable MAXINE WATERS, but 
for her, I can say without reservation, 
hesitation, or equivocation, this bill 
would not have come to fruition. She 
has been a champion for those who 
have been left out, left behind, locked 
out, those that I label as being among 
the least, the last, and the lost. 
The least, those who don’t inherit a 
legacy of wealth but, rather, a legacy 
of poverty. The least, those are persons 
who are still finding themselves living 
in the streets of life. 
The last, those are the last hired and 
the first fired. 
The lost, those who are lost in the 
richest country in the world, but lost 
perhaps 
in 
chemical 
consumption, 
drugs, if you will, lost because of men-
tal issues, but they are lost in the rich-
est country in the world. She has been 
a champion for them. 
I will always be grateful to her for 
working with me to help me to acquire 
a position on the Financial Services 
Committee. I think that probably but 
for her, I might not have the position 
that I have. So I know that she is not 
doing well today, but she will be back, 
and I want her to know today that I am 
appreciative for the many opportuni-
ties that I have acquired by virtue of 
her being there at the right time when 
these opportunities were available. 
I also thank the Members who had 
those bills, the 13 bills: Mrs. JOYCE 
BEATTY, 
Mr. 
AUCHINCLOSS, 
Mr. 
CLEAVER, Mr. MEEKS, Ms. GARCIA of 
Texas, Mr. TORRES, and of course, Ms. 
WATERS, had a bill as well. I had two 
bills associated with this package. 
This package, the Financial Services 
Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Eco-
nomic Justice Act, why is it needed? 
Why is it needed on this day some few 
days away from Juneteenth? And I cel-
ebrate Juneteenth, by the way. I com-
mend my colleague, Ms. JACKSON LEE, 
for her work on Juneteenth. 
I knew the father of Juneteenth, Al 
Edwards. Al Edwards was a State rep-
resentative in Texas, and he was a per-
son 
who 
was 
tenacious 
about 
Juneteenth. It was his legislation that 
passed the Texas House and Senate and 
was signed by the Governor of the 
State of Texas, making Juneteenth a 
holiday at a time when, quite frankly, 
people thought that it was impossible 
to get it done. 
Al 
Edwards, 
the 
father 
of 
Juneteenth, I always remember him, a 
dear friend. We celebrated Juneteenth 
together on many occasions. We tra-
versed the State together. He was one 
of my supporters. I know his family. 
His brother was a banker, Redick 
Edwards. He was my banker, as a mat-
ter of fact. So I have a relationship 
with this family. I want the world to 
know that I am appreciative for what 
he did to lay the foundation for 
Juneteenth as a holiday at the na-
tional level. 
I also express my appreciation for 
what Juneteenth is all about. General 
Gordon Granger came into Galveston, 
Texas, in 1865. The Emancipation Proc-
lamation had been signed. The war had 
ended, but in Texas, the slaves were 
not accorded their freedom. Some peo-
ple say that the word hadn’t reached 
Texas. I differ. The word reached 
Texas, but the slaveholders saw those 
slaves as personal property, and they 
saw no reason to give up their personal 
property simply because Mr. Lincoln 
signed an Emancipation Proclamation 
or simply because the war was over. 
That was their personal property. 
It is said that someone was sent, an 
envoy, if you will, to make it known to 
people in Texas that the slaves had 
been freed. This is prior to General 
Gordon Granger arriving in Galveston, 
Texas in 1865. Well, they said that that 
person didn’t quite get the message 
across, and one can well understand 
why, given the behavior of Texas, a 
State that seceded from the Union and 
also seceded from Mexico because of 
slavery. 
b 1315 
They were recalcitrant—and that is 
being kind—about the desire to main-
tain slavery. But President Lincoln 
sent General Gordon Granger. 
To say that he sent General Gordon 
Granger, quite frankly, is an incom-
plete statement. He sent General Gor-
don Granger and 2,000 troops. General 
Gordon Granger, being the wise man 
that he was, brought those troops with 
him, but they also had some friends 
with them. They had Mr. Winchester, 
Smith & Wesson. They were well 
equipped to present this message to the 
slaveholders. When it was presented 
with 2,000 troops who were well armed, 
it was received. 
It was the next year that the first 
Juneteenth 
celebration 
took 
place. 
That was in 1866, the first celebration. 
This is what Al Edwards shared with 
me about Juneteenth, the actual mon-
iker, the name for the holiday. It was 
his position that it became known as 
‘‘Juneteenth’’ because there was some 
question about the date that General 
Gordon Granger arrived, within the 
minds of the slaves, whether it was on 
the 18th or the 19th. Rather than con-
tinue a debate about the actual date, it 
simply 
became 
‘‘Juneteenth,’’ 
and 
folks can fill in the blank as they 
choose. 1866 was a big celebration of 
Juneteenth, a celebration of freedom. 
Again, I commend the father, Al 
Edwards, and I commend my colleague, 
Ms. JACKSON LEE, for her stellar work 
here in Congress to work Juneteenth 
through to the point that it is now a 
Federal holiday. I commend both of

them. I commend the many people who 
voted for it. 
Today, I thank the people who voted 
for that holiday, but I also thank the 
people who voted for H.R. 2543. I great-
ly appreciate the fact that you voted 
for the Financial Services Racial Eq-
uity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act because that act is needed. 
There has to be some question as to 
why it is needed more than 150 years 
after the end of slavery. Why would we 
need a Financial Services Racial Eq-
uity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act these many years later? 
Well, rather than give you my opin-
ion about it, I am going to read to you 
from a report presented by the Brook-
ings Institution. Brookings is well 
known and well respected. Let’s just 
see what Brookings says. This was pub-
lished on February 27, 2020. Not a lot 
has changed since February 27, 2020, so 
let’s examine what they at the Brook-
ings Institution have shared with us 
with reference to the Black folk in this 
country. 
It is styled, the article, ‘‘Examining 
the Black-White Wealth Gap.’’ Hear 
now the words of the Brookings Insti-
tution: ‘‘A close examination of wealth 
in the U.S. finds evidence of staggering 
racial disparities. At $171,000, the net 
worth of a typical White family is 
nearly 10 times greater than that of a 
Black family, which is $17,150.’’ This 
was in 2016. 
2016, White family’s worth: $171,000. 
This is the net worth. Black family’s 
net worth: $17,150. Over 150 years since 
the end of the Civil War, more than 400 
years since the first Africans were 
brought here as slaves in 1619, 400 years 
have passed, and we still have this 
wage gap. 
It goes on to read: ‘‘Gaps in wealth 
between Black and White households 
reveal the effects of accumulated in-
equality and discrimination, as well as 
differences in power and opportunity 
that can be traced back to this Na-
tion’s inception.’’ 
‘‘Traced back to this Nation’s incep-
tion.’’ This is the Brookings Institu-
tion. ‘‘Traced back to this Nation’s in-
ception.’’ 
‘‘The Black-White wealth gap re-
flects a society that has not and does 
not afford equality of opportunity to 
all its citizens.’’ 
Equality of opportunity is the oppor-
tunity—these are my words—to suc-
ceed on your merits or fail on your de-
merits, the opportunity for you to pull 
yourself up by your bootstraps. The so-
ciety, according to Brookings, does not 
afford equality of opportunity to all its 
citizens. 
It goes on to indicate: ‘‘Efforts by 
Black Americans to build wealth can 
be traced back throughout American 
history. But these efforts have been 
impeded in a host of ways, beginning 
with 246 years of chattel slavery fol-
lowed by congressional mismanage-
ment 
of 
the 
Freedman’s 
Savings 
Bank.’’ 
This bank was established after the 
slaves were freed to provide them an 
opportunity 
to 
accumulate 
wealth. 
They were free, but they were just free 
to the elements. They didn’t have prop-
erty that they owned. They were free 
to have persons abuse them. They were 
in a hostile environment. They were 
among people who had held them as 
property, people who had no desire to 
see their property taken from them. 
So they were free, but they were free 
to the wind, the rains, the elements, 
free to starve, and free to survive if 
they could. But that level of freedom 
was supposed to be curtailed with the 
Freedman’s Savings Bank. 
Well, the bank started with the best 
of intentions. According to the history 
I have read, it was the idea of Fred-
erick Douglass and was supposed to 
give the freed slaves an opportunity to 
acquire wealth, to save money, to un-
derstand the process of saving money, 
by the way. For people who had never 
had money—imagine this—never had 
money, what do you do with it if you 
acquire some? Many of them were 
working for the Union Army, and they 
were getting paid. So what do you do 
with this thing called money? 
Well, this bank was a place where 
they were supposed to be able to save. 
Unfortunately, there was mismanage-
ment. Congress did not put in the prop-
er safeguards so that it could continue 
to exist in perpetuity, and it left some 
61,144 depositors with losses of nearly 
$3 million in 1874. 
Then, there were persons who sought 
to move ahead, notwithstanding cir-
cumstances, and there was this area in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma, Tulsa’s Greenwood 
District. 
Here is what is said by Brookings 
with reference to Greenwood. It reads: 
‘‘The violent massacre decimating Tul-
sa’s Greenwood District in 1921, a popu-
lation of 10,000 that thrived as the epi-
center of African-American business 
and culture, commonly referred to as 
‘Black 
Wall 
Street,’ ’’—Black 
Wall 
Street was decimated. This was an op-
portunity for people to pull themselves 
up by their bootstraps, to find a means 
by which they could have commerce 
among themselves. They were of no 
threat to the broader community, but 
they had Black Wall Street taken away 
from them, literally destroyed. 
Thereafter, we had the discrimina-
tory policies throughout the 20th cen-
tury, including Jim Crow-era Black 
codes, laws that applied specifically to 
Black people. If you weren’t working, 
you could be incarcerated if you were 
Black. 
This is not contained here, but you 
had the convict leasing that took 
place, which was another form of slav-
ery. A person would be arrested for 
some minor offense and then placed in 
the hands of a landowner to work— 
leased, as it were, from the State. 
Some of these persons would work for 
the rest of their lives for some minor 
offense. They became slaves by another 
name, leased convicts. 
So, we had Black codes limiting op-
portunities in many Southern States. 
Along came the GI Bill. We are fast- 
forwarding now, and this is part of the 
article that I am reading. The GI Bill 
benefited and still benefits—a good 
many people who are right here in this 
Congress benefited from the GI Bill. 
Few Black people did. Very few Black 
people benefited from the GI Bill. The 
statistical 
information 
is 
over-
whelming in terms of the number that 
did not, small numbers. 
Of the thousands that initially bene-
fited from it, numbers less than 10 were 
Black. Thousands, with 10 maybe, or 
less, that were Black. There are some 
people who give a specific number on it 
at less than 10. But let’s just leave it 
with the fact that there were less than 
10 who benefited from it among thou-
sands. 
Here is why they didn’t benefit. They 
didn’t benefit because if you wanted to 
get a mortgage to buy property, which 
is what the GI Bill would afford you, 
the banks wouldn’t lend money in 
Black 
neighborhoods. 
If 
you 
were 
Black and you walked into the bank, 
that in and of itself was a denial of the 
loan. Your presence, your skin com-
plexion, that was the denial of your 
loan because banks were not lending to 
people living in Black neighborhoods. 
Well, someone would say: But, Al, 
how did they know they were living in 
a Black neighborhood? Because you 
couldn’t live in a White neighborhood. 
You couldn’t live among people who 
could get loans. There were restrictive 
covenants. The law said they couldn’t 
live there, and they were denied the op-
portunity to acquire land, which was 
another means of amassing wealth. 
By the way, this was not the first 
time people of color were denied the 
opportunity to acquire land. In the 
early years in this country, if you 
could fence in land and you could pro-
tect it, you could squat. It became 
yours. All you had to do was fence it in 
and protect it. Black people were not 
afforded that opportunity. 
So, here we are, a few days away 
from Juneteenth, which I will celebrate 
and appreciate, but I want you to un-
derstand why there was a need for H.R. 
2543, the Financial Services Racial Eq-
uity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice 
Act. There was a need for it. There is a 
need for it, and it passed this Congress. 
b 1330 
So we find ourselves now with the GI 
Bill and other circumstances that did 
not inure to the benefit of Black peo-
ple. 
According to this article, another 
circumstance was redlining. Redlining 
is where literally a red line was drawn 
around certain areas, and those who 
were in the business of selling and buy-
ing real estate, they rarely wanted to 
buy that land, so it became a place 
where people of color lived and the peo-
ple of color could not get loans to up-
grade their property, they could not 
get the loans needed to improve their 
lives because the banks were not lend-
ing.

So this wealth that many people 
have, the wealth that they have is 
something that they acquired in ways 
that were associated with the govern-
ment that locked Black people out. 
This—according to the article now— 
history matters for contemporary in-
equality, in part, because its legacy is 
passed down generation to generation. 
Repeat. This history matters for con-
temporary inequality, meaning the in-
equality we see today, in part, because 
its legacy is passed down generation to 
generation through unequal monetary 
inheritances which make up a great 
deal of current wealth, meaning a good 
many of the people who have the cur-
rent wealth they acquired this wealth 
by being born. 
A good many people make their first 
million dollars by being born, just com-
ing into the world, coming into the 
world in the right family. And these in-
heritances are passed down from gen-
eration to generation through unequal 
monetary inheritances, which make up 
a good deal of the current wealth. 
Interesting fact: In 2020 Americans 
are projected to inherit about $765 bil-
lion in gifts. In 2020, Americans are 
projected to inherit about $765 billion 
in gifts and bequests. I assure you only 
a marginal amount of this will be in-
herited by Black people. 
Excluding 
wealth 
transfers 
to 
spouses and transfers that support 
minor children, inheritances account 
for roughly 4 percent of annual house-
hold income. Black people have little 
to pass on, therefore, there is very lit-
tle that is inherited. And as a result 
there is no transfer of wealth from one 
generation to the next to speak of. 
It is really a sad state of affairs when 
you really think about it. We have 
been so conditioned to accept our cir-
cumstances in life that this sad state 
of affairs is just normal to us. It is just 
as we have embraced it almost. It is 
just the way things are. Things don’t 
have to be this way. That is why H.R. 
2543 is needed. 
Let me remind you one more time 
that Black people in this country have 
wealth that is about one-tenth of what 
White people have, about one-tenth of 
what they have. That, my friends, is 
something that is unacceptable. And it 
is not because Black people won’t work 
hard. It is not because they don’t have 
good work ethics. No, it is because a 
system that we exist within has been 
so structured that not only did we fail 
to acquire wealth, couldn’t acquire it 
early on in the history of the country, 
but this system still prevents Black 
people from acquiring wealth. 
I come to the floor and talk about 
these issues quite regularly, and there 
are some people who have asked me 
why am I so passionate about these 
issues? 
Well, why do I persist when I could 
easily just go on with my life? 
And I have had people tell me: You 
are doing all right. You are doing well. 
You have all of the trappings of a mid-
dle-class person. Why would you do 
this? 
Because I haven’t always been where 
I am now, and because I have a mem-
ory. 
I know what it is like to live in pov-
erty. 
I know what it is like to be discrimi-
nated against. I am a son of the seg-
regated south. Those rights that the 
Constitution recognized as belonging 
to me, my friends and neighbors took 
them away. They denied them. 
I know what it is like to drink from 
a colored water fountain. 
I know what it is like to go to a back 
door to get your food. And I know what 
it is like for the law to say that you 
have to go to that back door to get 
your food. 
I know what it is like to stand in a 
separate line in the supermarket and 
have to wait until all of the persons 
who are White are served before you 
can be served. 
I know what it is like to be born in a 
racist society. Believe me. I was born 
into the south. I am 74 years old. I 
know what racism smells like. I know 
what it looks like, I know what it 
tastes like, I know what it sounds like, 
and I know what it hurts like. 
So my passion emanates from the 
suffering and the understanding of 
what it is like to live in a hostile envi-
ronment. 
My friends, Black people are still liv-
ing in a hostile environment. We don’t 
like to acknowledge it, we want to be-
lieve otherwise, but it is a hostile envi-
ronment. It is a hostile environment. 
When you go in to get a loan and you 
are qualified, and you cannot get the 
same loan that a person of a different 
hue can acquire who is equally as 
qualified as you, you are equally as 
qualified as that person, that is hostile 
to you in terms of your economic sta-
tus. H.R. 2543 seeks to remedy that. 
H.R. 2543 makes it a crime to discrimi-
nate against a person in lending. 
I must tell you, the Honorable MAX-
INE WATERS has more courage than we 
can measure. There is no way to meas-
ure the amount of courage this woman 
has to bring this kind of legislation to 
this floor. And I have to acknowledge 
that the other leadership in the House, 
it was pretty courageous of them, too, 
to let this kind of bill come to the floor 
for a vote. And I congratulate and 
thank every person that voted for it. 
Because it ought to be a crime to de-
fraud a person out of a loan. 
For edification purposes, if you de-
fraud the bank, you can face a fine of 
up to $1 million, up to a $1 million fine. 
And you can be imprisoned. There is no 
such fine if the bank denies you a loan, 
defrauds you of your loan that you are 
entitled to. 
That changed with the passage of 
H.R. 2543. This is historic. You are not 
going to read about it in the news-
papers. But you are going to hear about 
it from me right here on this floor of 
the House. 
I didn’t come here to hide the good 
news. We want to let the world know 
about the good news. The challenge 
would be, of course, to get it through 
the Senate. I believe this President 
will sign it but getting it through the 
Senate will be a challenge. 
But back to where we were. So we 
find ourselves acclimating to the hos-
tile environment we have. We find our-
selves accepting our circumstance. And 
there are others who would say that 
you are free, you can just make your 
way as others have made their way, 
pull yourself up by your bootstraps. 
Well, let’s see where we are with 
bootstraps. Bootstraps would first re-
quire that you have boots. Black folk 
don’t have the boots. The boots are at 
the banks. 
People in this country who have lit-
tle acquire some things with their hard 
work and then they are in a position to 
borrow money. If we are not given a 
fair opportunity to borrow money, 
which would give us the boots, and 
then we can have straps added to the 
boots, you are not going to be able to 
pull yourself up by the bootstraps when 
you don’t have boots. It just doesn’t 
happen. And that is the circumstance 
we find ourselves in. 
There are many people who will say 
that by doing what I am doing I am 
just making excuses. Well, tell that to 
the people at the Brookings Institu-
tion. Convince them. They compile this 
statistical information, the empirical 
evidence I have shared with you. This 
is not AL GREEN speaking in the sense 
of AL GREEN compiled the information 
that you have heard. No. This is the 
Brookings Institution. I am just the 
messenger. They compiled the mes-
sage. 
So we find ourselves in this hostile 
environment as it relates to the econ-
omy. 
It is a hostile environment in many 
other ways, as well. It is a hostile envi-
ronment just in terms of our living. 
Still discriminated against when it 
comes to housing. Still discriminated 
against. And it took the death of Dr. 
King to get the Fair Housing Act 
through Congress. 
It is amazing how many of the sem-
inal pieces of legislation that impact 
the lives of people of color are signed 
in ink, but they were written with the 
blood of people who made great sac-
rifices, Dr. King’s life, John Lewis and 
the Edmund Pettus Bridge. But for 
John Lewis and the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, additional civil rights laws

So my dear friends, we are in a hos-
tile environment. People don’t like to 
talk about the hostile environment. 
When people say Jews will not replace 
us—when they say Jews will not re-
place us—my friends, many of those 
people work in restaurants. 
One can but only imagine what hap-
pens to the food of a Jewish person 
when you have a person working in the 
restaurant who says Jews will not re-
place us. Given that this theory—this

fake theory, this myth—there are some 
other words that can be used that my 
mother taught me not to use, but these 
prevarications are associated with this 
myth. 
Friends, the myth is that Jews are 
going to use Black people to replace 
White people—which is ridiculous. But 
that means that there are some people 
that are very hostile to Black people 
since they think Black people are 
going to take over—and minorities and 
immigrants. 
Just imagine what it can be like to 
go into a restaurant, and you have per-
sons who don’t find favor with treating 
us fairly. We have to be careful where 
we eat—we do—if you understand the 
environment you are living in. Hostile 
environment. 
Can you imagine some of these per-
sons—Jews will not replace us—persons 
who are up in Idaho dressed in this 
military regalia, can you imagine one 
of them being a physician? You have 
got to go into this office, you need 
help, maybe you are going into the 
emergency room. It is a hostile envi-
ronment. 
You can’t appreciate it if you don’t 
understand the consequences that can 
emanate from people who scream Jews 
will not replace us, people who burn 
crosses, people who say that they are a 
part of a superior race. 
You don’t think it is a hostile envi-
ronment? Ask the ghosts of the people 
who went into the Tops Food Store. 
Ask the ghosts if it is a hostile envi-
ronment. He went there to kill Black 
people. If you don’t think it is a hostile 
environment, ask the spirits of the peo-
ple who were in the Walmart store in 
Texas. It is a hostile environment. 
It is hostile if you understand and ap-
preciate what is going on around you. I 
don’t say it is hostile to the extent 
that we can’t overcome it. I don’t say 
it is hostile to the extent that we 
should simply surrender and throw up 
our hands. That is why we have H.R. 
2543, and there are other aspects of it 
requiring transparency. We need to 
know who is integrating their business. 
Sometimes when people have to an-
nounce 
their 
circumstance, 
they 
change that condition. H.R. 2543 will 
provide a lot of transparency. This is 
needed when you are in a hostile envi-
ronment. 
I would say to you, my dear friends— 
as Brookings puts it—just how large 
and persistent are these racial wealth 
gaps? Brookings has made it very clear 
that at least $17,150 for a Black family 
in terms of wealth is about one-tenth 
of the $171,000 net worth of a White 
family. 
My hope is that we will remember 
yesterday as a moment in time that 
will hopefully accelerate the time that 
we will need to bring about a closing of 
this wealth gap. I think that what hap-
pened yesterday is a great step in that 
direction. It is not the last step. It is 
really not the first, there are other 
things that have been done, but it is a 
step in that direction. We need to close 
the wealth gap. 
Madam Speaker, I pledge to do all 
that I can to close it. I want to let you 
know that in doing all of these things 
and saying what I am saying to you, 
explaining it in terms that many peo-
ple will find uncomfortable, I still say 
that I love my country. 
I still say I love my country. I still 
say I salute the flag. I am not some 
person who hates America. I am the 
guy who wants America to become 
America for all Americans. I want 
equality of opportunity. I want Amer-
ica to live up to its promise. 
As I celebrate Juneteenth, I assure 
you, I will do the things that are cus-
tomarily done in terms of the food and 
the drink and just having a great time 
celebrating freedom. It does not mean 
that I am going to forget the need for 
more work to be done. 
I have great respect for and apprecia-
tion for Mr. HOYER. I can’t tell you how 
much I appreciate and respect him. He 
has said things here on this floor that 
I appreciate with reference to discrimi-
nation. Others have said things, too, 
that I greatly appreciate, it is just that 
I have sort of built a relationship with 
him. 
I appreciate his indicating that Slav-
ery Remembrance Day is something 
that is on his agenda. I am going to 
celebrate Juneteenth, but that doesn’t 
mean that I won’t commemorate Au-
gust and Slavery Remembrance Day, 
that is a day of commemoration. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to enjoy 
Juneteenth, 
but 
remembering 
that 
there is still great work to be done. I 
remember as a child my grandfather 
reminding me that I would have to be 
willing to make sacrifices that others 
would not have to make if I wanted to 
succeed in life in this country. Sac-
rifices that others would not have to 
make. I assumed that we all make the 
same sacrifices, but my grandfather 
taught my differently—that is not the 
case. 
While I celebrate, I still have some 
appreciation for the sacrifices that 
have been made and have to be made. I 
understand that we need the MAXINE 
WATERS of the world who work hard to 
make sure that while she has the gavel 
that the change that she can bring 
about will take place. 
I appreciate the SHEILA
JACKSON 
LEEs of the world who worked hard to 
make Juneteenth a holiday. It is a hol-
iday and it is a time to celebrate. I also 
think we need a day to commemorate 
because in Texas there is a desire to 
not allow slavery to be taught—the 
history of African Americans as it re-
lates to slavery to be taught in the 
schools. You can’t teach it if Texas has 
its way. 
Madam Speaker, I celebrate and com-
memorate. I thank God for the oppor-
tunity to serve in this House. I thank 
those persons who voted for the bill 
that we brought to the floor, H.R. 2543. 
I appreciate you, each of you, and I will 
be sending you a written thank you, 
but I didn’t want too much time to 
pass without saying it to the world. I 
appreciate it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O God, our refuge and strength, give 
us reverence for Your greatness. Guide 
our Senators around the pitfalls of 
their work, enabling them to have 
hearts sustained by Your peace. May 
they surrender their will to You, as 
they trust You to direct their steps. 
Lord, give them the wisdom to re-
ceive Your reproof with the under-
standing that You chastise those whom 
You love for their good. 
Make their lives productive for the 
glory of Your Name. And, Lord, bless 
Ukraine. 
We pray in the Name of our re-
deemer. Amen.

ACT OF 2021—Resumed 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of H.R. 3967, which 
the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 3967) to improve health care 
and benefits for veterans exposed to toxic 
substances, and for other purposes. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
H.R. 3967 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today is a historic, long-awaited day 
for our Nation’s veterans. In a few mo-
ments, the Senate is finally going to 
pass the PACT Act—the most signifi-
cant expansion of healthcare benefits 
for our veterans in generations. It is of-
ficially called the SFC Heath Robinson 
Honoring our PACT Act because Heath 
Robinson was one of the many who suc-
cumbed to the poisons of toxins that he 
was exposed to fighting for America. 
For too long, our Nation’s veterans 
have faced an absurd indignity: They 
enlisted to serve our country, went 
abroad in good health, and came back, 
only to get sick from toxic exposure 
endured while in the line of duty. 
As many as 31⁄2 million veterans have 
been affected by burn pits since 9/11. 
Yet approximately 80 percent of all dis-
ability claims connected to burn pits 
have been rejected by the VA. So many 
of our veterans have been fought by the 
VA after they fought for us, as they try 
to get healthcare benefits. Many of 
them had to hire lawyers just to prove 
their illnesses and then do a com-
plicated legal dance to show what ev-
eryone knew: that toxic exposure from 
burn pits caused all kinds of cancers 
and other diseases. That was so, so 
wrong. Indignity. The callousness of 
forcing veterans who got sick as they 
were fighting for us because of expo-
sure to these toxins, to have to fight 
for years in the VA to get the benefits 
they deserved—well, that will soon be 
over, praise God. 
To these American heroes who have 
carried on without the benefits they 
deserve, I have one thing to say: No 
more. Today, the Senate finally takes 
action to right this profound wrong. 
The PACT Act will finally change 
outdated rules at the VA that have 
been in effect for far too long that pre-
vent our veterans from getting the care 
they need to treat health complica-
tions caused by burn pits. It will ex-
pand eligibility for VA medical care to 
make sure veterans get the help they 
need. 
There is even more good news in the 
PACT Act. It is not just about burn 
pits, as important as they are. The 
PACT Act will expand coverage of 
health issues exacerbated by Agent Or-
ange, which, over the years, I have 
strongly pushed for in this Chamber. 
I want to give deep thanks to Sen-
ators TESTER and MORAN, who worked 
for months to push this bill over the 
finish line. Their leadership on this 
issue has been extraordinary. 
I want to thank my colleagues. This 
is another bipartisan action that is ac-
complishing something very signifi-
cant, and I want to thank my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle 
who supported the bill through its con-
sideration.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2984 
June 16, 2022 
Most importantly, I want to thank 
the many veterans, the veterans serv-
ice organizations, advocates like Jon 
Stewart and John Feal, who never gave 
up on making this change happen. Be-
cause of their advocacy, our veterans 
will finally get the dignity and care 
they rightfully deserve. 
If you want to take the measure of 
any nation, look no further than the 
way it treats those who sacrificed ev-
erything in the line of duty. Today, the 
Senate is making sure we treat our he-
roes the way our heroes deserve to be 
treated—with dignity, with gratitude 
for everything they have done to pro-
tect our way of life. Gone are the days 
when veterans will have to struggle to 
prove and fight to get benefits they de-
serve. 
I thank my colleagues for their work, 
and I urge all of us to vote yes on this 
long-overdue legislation. 
NOMINATION OF STEVEN M. DETTELBACH 
Madam President, now let me talk 
about something that just happened in 
the Judiciary Committee. 
As we await the completion of the 
gun safety bill, there is another step 
the Senate will take today to protect 
our communities from gun violence. 
We 
can 
move 
to 
confirm 
Steven 
Dettelbach as the Director of the Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives. 
I want to thank Senator DURBIN and 
the Judiciary Committee for moving 
this nomination expeditiously. 
Later today, I will move to discharge 
the nomination of Mr. Dettelbach from 
the Judiciary Committee after his 
nomination resulted in a tie vote. 
Based on his record and qualifications, 
Dettelbach unquestionably deserves bi-
partisan support, but either way, he is 
going to move forward. 
The ATF has not had a permanent 
Director since 2015, so confirming Mr. 
Dettelbach is one of my top priorities 
before the end of June. We need a fully 
functional, fully staffed ATF in order 
for that Agency to fulfill its mission of 
keeping our communities safe from 
gun violence. 
Obviously, the legislation we are 
talking about that is being negotiated 
is very important, but so is having a 
fully functioning ATF. It is critical we 
have a fully functioning, fully staffed 
ATF for the Agency to carry out its 
mission of protecting our communities 
from gun violence, and what they do is 
very, very important. Sometimes it is 
quiet. Sometimes it is not noticed. But 
their ability to deal with gun traf-
fickers and so many others who poison 
our streets with illegal guns that take 
the lives of our children—the ATF is 
essential in stopping that, curtailing 
it, and having a strong, qualified nomi-
nee like Mr. Dettelbach will certainly 
help reduce the scourge of gun violence 
in this country, particularly because 
the ATF has not had anyone at the 
helm since 2015. So I am going to make 
sure his nomination moves as quickly 
and speedily through this Chamber as 
possible. 
GUN SAFETY 
Madam President, now on the other 
issue, the debate on gun safety, this 
week, the Senate is making progress on 
a subject that has frustrated this 
Chamber for decades: meaningful gun 
safety legislation. 
Last night, I spoke with Senator 
MURPHY on the latest round of bipar-
tisan negotiations. Both sides met well 
into the evening and will be meeting 
again this afternoon. The work is not 
finished. No one will pretend that has 
been easy, but both parties are still 
working towards a final product. I urge 
both sides to keep going at it. This is 
so important to the American people. I 
am hopeful they will come to an agree-
ment on bill text soon. 
Once we have the language for a gun 
safety bill, I am prepared to make it 
the next legislative matter considered 
on the Senate floor. We want to move 
quickly and decisively to make sure we 
don’t let this opportunity slip away. 
Just a month ago, very few could 
have 
predicted 
that 
this 
Chamber 
would make as much progress as we 
have on a gun safety compromise. 
Given our recent history, it is hard to 
blame Americans who feel hopeless 
that change can happen on this issue. 
But that is why you never give up— 
never give up—even after facing so 
many disappointments. No matter how 
many times gridlock has taken hold in 
the past, survivors of gun violence, gun 
safety activists, people who have lost 
loved ones, children, have fought and 
fought and fought. They have visited 
our office every year, many times. Be-
cause of them, we are closer to making 
real progress than we have been in a 
long, long time. 
The work is not done, but I remain 
hopeful that we are going to get it 
done, and I want to thank my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
continuing their work towards a com-
promise. 
JANUARY 6 HEARINGS 
Madam President, now on the Big 
Lie, today, the House will continue its 
public hearings on the Capitol attack 
of January 6. I urge all Americans to 
tune in and listen to the strong case 
our House colleagues are presenting. 
The dangers of the Big Lie transcend 
the Capitol attack. This week, many 
hard-right candidates, who deny the 
2020 elections and have little faith in 
the fidelity of our elections, who may 
well move to undermine them, have 
won primaries and will be on the ballot 
in November. 
If you want to know what our coun-
try could turn into if they win, look at 
what is happening right now in New 
Mexico. Right now, a county commis-
sioner in that State is refusing to cer-
tify the results of his county’s primary 
elections because of debunked con-
spiracy theories involving Dominion 
voting machines. The votes of over 
7,000 people are now in jeopardy, and 
the State supreme court has been com-
pelled to step in. This is the result of 
the Big Lie spread by Donald Trump. 
He cannot accept the fact that he lost. 
His ego is so huge and infantile that he 
is undermining American democracy, 
and too many, often out of fear of 
Trump and the primary voter acolytes 
that Trump has, go along with this. 
It is happening in too many States. 
It is a real danger to our democracy. In 
Nevada, for instance, secretary of state 
candidate Jim Marchant has said that 
if he had been in office in 2020, he 
wouldn’t have certified Joe Biden’s vic-
tory. 
That is dangerous stuff. Do my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
who go along with this realize that? 
This undermines the democracy, sacred 
to all of us—Democrat, Republican, 
Independent. 
America needs to be watching what 
is happening in States like New Mexico 
and Nevada because if we are not care-
ful, it will be a preview of greater hor-
rors to come. It is not a partisan argu-
ment; it is simply about democracy 
versus authoritarianism. Many of the 
things said by some of these office-
holders were said by people who then 
led their country to authoritarian re-
gimes. 
It doesn’t matter if you are a Demo-
crat or a Republican or an Inde-
pendent; democracy is at risk if we ele-
vate individuals who don’t believe in 
the sanctity of elections. 
I urge the American people, regard-
less of party, to reject these radicals in 
November because our democracy is 
literally—literally—on the line. 
OCEAN SHIPPING REFORM ACT 
Madam President, finally, on the 
ocean shipping bill, today is an impor-
tant day. President Biden will sign the 
Ocean Shipping Reform Act into law. 
Shipping reform is exactly the kind 
of bill that can make a difference to 
the American people. It fights infla-
tion. It relieves our supply chains. It 
will help small businesses and con-
sumers alike. 
Our ports need help. The cost of send-
ing a container across the Pacific 
Ocean is up 1,000 percent. Who pays 
that? The consumer and the American 
exporter. Our ports need help. Our sup-
ply chains need relief. With today’s 
signing, we can now say help is on the 
way. 
I thank President Biden for signing 
this bill quickly. I thank my col-
leagues, Senators KLOBUCHAR, THUNE, 
and CANTWELL, for their leadership in 
the Senate. I thank Speaker PELOSI 
and my House colleagues for approving 
the bill earlier this week. 
I would say to our friends in the 
media: No, this has been bipartisan. 
There hasn’t been conflict, but it is im-
portant. Please pay some attention to 
it. Things are getting done to deal with 
the scourge of inflation. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2985 
June 16, 2022 
year, experts warned that such reckless 
spending would not just raise prices for 
working families, but could also trig-
ger a full-on recession. 
In February of 2021, for example, a 
prominent economist testified right 
here on Capitol Hill and said Demo-
crats’ runaway spending might back 
the Federal Reserve into a corner. It 
might leave the Fed no choice but to 
sharply raise interest rates. And that 
would not just slow down our economic 
recovery, but potentially actually shift 
it into reverse. 
Sound familiar? That is exactly what 
has happened right before our eyes. 
Yesterday, a few days after the far- 
worse-than-expected inflation report 
for the month of May, the Fed an-
nounced the biggest interest rate hike 
in 28 years—the biggest interest rate 
hike in 28 years. And they signal more 
increases may be on the deck soon. The 
Fed acted too slowly on the incorrect 
presumption that inflation would fade 
away. Now that it hasn’t happened, 
they have to make up for lost time. 
The stock markets that carry Ameri-
cans’ retirement savings have been in 
free fall. The S&P 500 has lost a full 
one-fifth of its value in just 6 months. 
Americans’ consumer confidence just 
nose-dived to its lowest point ever re-
corded—worse than at any point during 
the 2008 recession, worse than the early 
panic over COVID. 
The 
percentage 
of 
small 
businessowners who say they are opti-
mistic about the near future has never 
been this low in the entire 48-year his-
tory of that survey. And signs suggest 
this may be just the beginning of the 
pain for the American people. 
Just 3 months ago, the Fed predicted 
we would not have to see rising unem-
ployment until 2024. Yesterday, how-
ever, they announced they now see un-
employment increasing this year, next 
year, and—and the year after that. 
Just between March and May, their 
official estimate for our country’s eco-
nomic growth in 2022 plummeted—lis-
ten to this—by 40 percent. It looks in-
creasingly like Democrats may have 
driven America toward a full-on reces-
sion. They have driven our country to-
ward a full-on recession. 
The term ‘‘stagflation’’ was invented 
to describe the most painful economic 
conditions for workers and families. It 
means the worst of three worlds at 
once: High inflation, slow growth, and 
rising unemployment. Unless some-
thing changes—we all hope it does— 
this appears to be exactly the trajec-
tory on which Democrats’ policies have 
put our country. 
The last time we had a unified Re-
publican government, our policies cre-
ated low inflation, robust growth, and 
record-low unemployment. Sole Demo-
cratic Party control has produced 
something quite different. 
But, unbelievably, the same Wash-
ington Democrats who dug this hole 
seem unwilling to put away their shov-
els. They want to keep digging. With 
our economy trending toward a pos-
sible recession, some of our colleagues 
are trying to restart discussions about 
massive trillion-dollar-plus tax hikes. 
It really beggars belief. Democrats 
spent 2021 trying to respond to infla-
tion with even more—even more—reck-
less spending, and now they are spend-
ing 2022 trying to respond to a looming 
recession with gigantic tax hikes. 
This is utter nonsense. It’s unbeliev-
able. 
Democrats have quite likely inflated 
their way into a recession, and now 
they want to pile on historic tax hikes 
and make it worse. 
In every poll, in every survey, the 
American people make their views of 
the Democratic economic policies crys-
tal clear. For the sake of the country, 
let’s hope our colleagues remember the 
first rule of holes, and stop digging. 
ENERGY 
Madam President, on a related mat-
ter, tomorrow President Biden will 
host the Major Economies Forum on 
Energy and Climate. Meanwhile, work-
ing Americans will continue to face the 
consequences of his disastrous energy 
and climate policies. While President 
Biden and his team have declared a 
holy war on America’s domestic pro-
duction, average gas prices have soared 
over $5. By August, they are projected 
to hit $6.20. 
Diesel, which literally drives our 
economy, is now at an all-time high. 
Natural gas is up 30.2 percent; fuel oil 
is up 106.7 percent; groceries, which 
overwhelmingly rely on diesel semis to 
get to supermarket shelves, are up 
nearly 12 percent compared to last 
year. 
These eye-popping numbers are the 
predictable results of Democrats’ infla-
tionary policies and specifically their 
war on affordable American energy. 
Well, the American people continue 
to tell Democrats they are not inter-
ested in buying fantastical green boon-
doggles when they can barely afford 
the essentials today. According to one 
recent poll, more than half of Ameri-
cans are very or extremely concerned 
about how grocery prices are affecting 
their household’s financial situation. 
Nearly two-thirds feel that same way 
about gas prices. 
But Washington Democrats are still 
in staggering disarray over how and 
even whether to clean up the mess they 
have made. 
Some, like the administration’s cli-
mate czar, John Kerry, are still in de-
nial. He said recently: ‘‘We absolutely 
don’t’’—John Kerry—‘‘We absolutely 
don’t’’ need to ramp up oil and gas pro-
duction. Instead, he insisted: 
We have to transition to electric vehicles 
about 20 times faster than we are now. 
Americans continue to report that 
just affording gas has become a daily 
hardship, but the former Senator from 
Massachusetts says to folks in places 
like Kentucky: The solution is just buy 
an expensive electric car. 
Now, some administration officials 
are willing to acknowledge the prob-
lem, just not its source. The American 
people continue to hear about a so- 
called ‘‘Putin price hike’’ even though 
gas was already up nearly 50 percent— 
50 percent—since President Biden took 
office at the time Russia launched the 
war. Some Members of the President’s 
party seem more clear-eyed. Yesterday, 
one House Democrat said: 
I’m calling on the President to sit down 
with domestic oil and gas companies and find 
a way to lower prices. . . . The President 
needs to bring everyone together. 
That was a Democrat in the House. 
But, unfortunately, the Biden admin-
istration still appears to be jaw- 
droppingly 
naive 
about 
the 
con-
sequences of its war on affordable do-
mestic energy. As energy prices contin-
ued to skyrocket earlier this year, the 
White House reportedly insisted the 
production could just be turned back 
on with the flip of a switch. 
According to one analyst: 
They thought shale oil production could 
grow sharply in the near term—like in a 
matter of months or quarters . . . They were 
shocked to learn that that’s like asking for 
blood from a stone. 
Of 
course, 
Democrats’ 
misunder-
standing hasn’t stopped them from try-
ing to use American energy producers 
as a scapegoat. Yesterday, the White 
House press secretary insisted: ‘‘We 
have done our part . . . ‘’ she said. ‘‘We 
need [oil companies] to act.’’ 
Really? That doesn’t pass the laugh 
test. 
In a letter yesterday, one of Amer-
ica’s biggest domestic producers asked 
the Biden administration for three 
things: ‘‘Clear and consistent policy 
that supports U.S. resource develop-
ment’’, ‘‘regular and predictable lease 
sales’’, and ‘‘support for infrastructure 
such as pipelines.’’ 
Notice that this is precisely a sum-
mary of what President Biden hasn’t— 
has not been doing since he took office. 
Since day one, the Biden administra-
tion has been outright hostile to U.S. 
resource development, frozen certain 
new development leases, and canceled a 
pipeline project that would have ex-
panded efficient energy transport and 
created American jobs. 
The American people are bracing for 
a very pricey summer, from the gas 
pump to the grocery store. And they 
know exactly who to blame. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I re-
cently read an article published by a 
woman who is very credible on the 
issue of energy, which I would like to 
share after the statements recently 
made by the Republican leader. 
The question is whether or not our 
production of crude oil during Presi-
dent Biden’s Presidency was higher or 
lower than the Trump administration. 
I quote Heather Cox Richardson: 
To encourage production, Biden’s officials 
have issued more permits on federal lands 
than were issued in the Trump administra-
tion’s first three years, at a pace that ap-
proaches [that of] George W. Bush’s adminis-
tration. Only 10% of all U.S. drilling takes 
place on federal land, but the Bureau of Land

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2986 
June 16, 2022 
Management confirms that more than 9,000 
drilling permits on public land are currently 
approved. Not all would be productive if they 
were developed, and none of them could start 
producing immediately, but this undercuts 
the argument that gas prices are high be-
cause the Biden administration has choked 
off permits. 
She goes on to say: 
What appears to be driving U.S. gas prices 
is the pressure investors are putting on oil 
companies, whose officers answer to their in-
vestors. Limited production creates higher 
prices that are driving record profits. In a 
March 2022 survey of 141 U.S. oil producers 
asking them why they were holding back 
production, 59 percent said they were under 
investor pressure. Only 6 percent blamed 
‘‘government regulations’’ for their lack of 
increased production. 
Oil companies are seeing huge profits 
and are using the money for stock 
buybacks to raise stock prices. BP, 
Shell, 
ExxonMobil, 
Chevron, 
TotalEnergies, Eni, and Equinor will 
give between $38 and $41 billion to 
shareholders 
through 
buyback 
pro-
grams this year. 
That is a little different picture than 
was just painted by the Republican 
leader. 
There is some culpability here when 
it comes to the oil companies, and 
blaming President Biden is ignoring 
the fact that he has, on Federal lands, 
which, as written, account for a per-
centage of our production in this coun-
try, expanded permits beyond the lev-
els offered by the previous administra-
tion. This is certainly a more complex 
issue than was suggested by the Sen-
ator from Kentucky. 
GUN LEGISLATION 
Mr. President, on another topic, I 
would say that we have learned a lot 
from COVID–19. We have learned that 
this 
particular 
pandemic 
targeted, 
more than ever, those among us who 
were up in years, the seniors. They 
were the most vulnerable to the attack 
of COVID–19, and many folks in their 
senior years were threatened by and 
some succumbed to this terrible pan-
demic. We knew that it was a problem 
for senior citizens and still do. 
Yesterday, we had a hearing in the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
that 
called to mind the real question before 
us: What if this pandemic had targeted 
our children and babies? What if we 
knew that the next pandemic was 
going to make them particularly vul-
nerable? Well, I will tell you, I believe 
this country—rightly so—would rally 
behind an effort to do everything we 
could to protect our children from this 
looming, potential, cause of death. 
Mine is only a hypothetical when it 
comes to pandemics, but it is not a hy-
pothetical when it comes to the No. 1 
cause of death among children and 
teenagers in America. The CDC, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention, just announced within the last 
2 weeks that the No. 1 cause of death is 
not a pandemic but guns, firearms, gun 
violence, and gun deaths. 
Yesterday, we held a hearing in the 
Judiciary Committee on the leading 
cause of death for children in Amer-
ica—guns. In 2020—the most recent 
year’s statistics that are available— 
more than 4,300 American babies, chil-
dren, and teens died from gunfire. Dur-
ing the hearing, we heard from a cho-
rus of witnesses: healthcare witnesses, 
law enforcement, community violence 
prevention. They agreed on one basic 
thing: that gun violence is trauma-
tizing an entire generation of Amer-
ican youth. Lawmakers in Congress 
have a responsibility to stem this tide 
of violence. 
One of the witnesses was a young col-
lege student from Northeastern Univer-
sity in Boston. He actually grew up on 
the West Side of Chicago. His name is 
Ernest Willingham. He isn’t 20 years 
old yet, but his testimony sounded like 
the testimony of a person who was wise 
in years. He has already experienced 
one gun-related tragedy after another. 
Mr. Willingham told the members of 
our committee: 
I have seen my brother, my father, my 
cousin and my best friend become victims of 
gun violence. . . . This is something that 
young people should never have to prepare 
themselves for, yet it remains the lived expe-
rience of so many children and youth around 
our nation. 
He continued: 
We are better than this as a country, and 
we can solve this crisis. 
Then he made reference to one basic 
fact. He said: 
Most kids who grew up with me spent more 
time attending funerals than weddings. 
That is a sobering statement, and it 
puts into perspective not only the 
threat of gun violence and the toll that 
it has taken but also the trauma that 
is visited on so many who are affected 
by this gun violence. We think in-
stantly of the families of the victims, 
but trauma goes far beyond that; it ex-
tends to families of witnesses and to so 
many others whose lives are affected. 
Two weeks ago, in Chicago, Lurie 
Children’s Hospital convened a group of 
young people from gun-infested neigh-
borhoods. They agreed to meet with me 
on a private, off-the-record basis. We 
closed the door, and I looked at their 20 
or 30 faces and said: 
Tell me what I need to know as a U.S. Sen-
ator about what it means to grow up in your 
neighborhood. 
I can tell you that there was an out-
pouring of statements from every one 
of them, talking about how guns have 
become such a sad and tragic part of 
their lives and how many of them had 
either been shot or had lost a family 
member or a loved one or a friend to 
gun violence. And they talked about 
the basics. 
One young man said: 
Senator, we need home training. 
I said: 
What do you mean by ‘‘home training’’? 
He said: 
We need parents to tell us what is right 
and wrong, to tell us what to do. There are 
no rules. The only rules I find are the rules 
of the gang’s on the street. I know what 
their rules are, but I don’t know what the 
rules are in terms of my own life. 
I think back on my childhood. Rules? 
Oh, I had plenty of rules, and most kids 
do: Clean your plate. Clean your room. 
Do your homework. Take out the 
trash. Walk the dog. 
The rules were coming at me all the 
time. Then I went and attended Catho-
lic grade schools, and, believe me, they 
had even more rules to play by. 
The statements by many of these 
young people were that their lives were 
adrift in the earliest stages. Some of it 
reflects parents who are facing pov-
erty, who are struggling to make ends 
meet. Some are working two jobs just 
to get enough money to keep food on 
the table. They can’t be at home and 
nurturing and guiding these young peo-
ple as much as they should because 
they are struggling from paycheck to 
paycheck. That is a reality of poverty 
in these neighborhoods. 
Some families aren’t that ‘‘lucky’’— 
and I use that in quotes. Some are dys-
functional. They have one parent who 
is a drug addict and another parent 
who is inclined toward violence or al-
cohol, and the child suffers as a result 
of it. 
The point I am getting to is this: 
That hearing yesterday on gun vio-
lence highlighted the reality of what 
life is like for too many kids in places 
around America, and it highlighted the 
importance of doing something. 
We had a doctor there who was the 
chairman of the American Academy of 
Pediatrics. She said that she sent out 
an email, in preparation for her testi-
mony, to a number of pediatricians and 
said: 
Can you share with me any personal expe-
riences with kids who are victims of gun vio-
lence? 
She received 300 replies, which we put 
in the record of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee’s. 
They 
were 
sobering 
statements by doctors of what they 
faced with kids who had either been 
victims of gun violence or who had wit-
nessed it and were trauma victims as a 
result. That was the reality. 
Ernest Willingham, whom I men-
tioned earlier, talked about what it 
meant to have this as an integral part 
of his life while growing up. He was one 
of the lucky ones. He was able to break 
free from this terrible experience and 
really start down the path toward a 
college education. 
We had the chief of police from Phoe-
nix, AZ, Chief Williams, who came in. 
She is a 23-year veteran of the police 
force and is the chief in a major city. 
She talked about guns and kids and 
what they face in her city, where she 
just recently had a number of her po-
licemen who were injured in the line of 
duty. 
She spoke to that and said: 
Last night, there was a shooting, and luck-
ily they survived or I wouldn’t be here today. 
That is the reality of guns in Amer-
ica. 
We focused with her on the guns like 
AR–15s that are showing up at these

shootouts and massacres. The AR–15 is 
a 
‘‘semiautomatic’’ 
weapon, 
which 
means it fires ammunition every time 
you pull the trigger, but it can be con-
verted into an automatic weapon, 
whereby you can hold the trigger, and 
it just sprays ammunition at people 
who are victims. 
How many of these exist in the 
United States today, these AR–15 as-
sault weapons that we are seeing in so 
many of these massacres and shoot-
ings? We are not sure. It is somewhere 
between 10 and 20 million—10 and 20 
million. 
I asked the pediatrician what kind of 
damage is done by these guns, and she 
told us: It is devastating. 
Some of the stories that are coming 
back from these mass shootings now 
are horrific. I just even hesitate to re-
peat them, but they have been reported 
widely in the news—the damage that is 
done to these poor little bodies in the 
classrooms when these weapons are 
turned on them. 
Now, there is no earthly purpose for 
such a weapon other than their use in 
the military—it isn’t used for sport; it 
isn’t used for hunting; it can’t be used 
for self-defense very effectively—but so 
many, millions, are being sold across 
America. 
From my point of view, we should be 
dealing with that issue directly, as well 
as high-capacity magazines that allow 
these to happen, but, unfortunately, we 
can’t at this moment. We don’t have 
the political will to do it in the U.S. 
Senate—50–50 divided. We do have the 
will to take up the framework, which is 
being worked on at this very moment. 
It isn’t what I want to see, and it isn’t 
what many of us want to see, but it is 
a step forward. 
I commend the Senators—the Demo-
crat CHRIS MURPHY and the Republican 
JOHN CORNYN—for assembling a group 
of some 20 Senators, Democrats and 
Republicans, who are working on this 
legislation. It is critically important 
that they are successful. I know they 
are having drafting challenges—that is 
common around here—but we have 
plenty of talented people, and if the 
Members, in good will, sit down, they 
can work out their differences. I urge 
them to do so. 
Senator 
SCHUMER
and 
Senator 
MCCONNELL publicly support this un-
dertaking. It is one of the rare bipar-
tisan events in the U.S. Senate, and it 
is on the critical issue of gun safety. I 
hope that by next week, we can con-
sider this on the floor. 
NOMINATION OF STEVEN M. DETTELBACH 
Mr. President, there is another mat-
ter that will come before us as soon as 
today, and it was a matter that was 
raised in the Judiciary Committee this 
morning. 
Today, we can start by discharging 
from the committee a proven, battle- 
tested leader to head the Bureau of Al-
cohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explo-
sives. His name is Steve Dettelbach. 
The Presiding Officer knows him well 
as he served as a member of his staff as 
a detailee. He has an exceptional 
record. 
You see, it has been 7 years since 
there has been a Senate-confirmed Di-
rector at ATF, and at a moment when 
guns are killing our kids at a dev-
astating rate, this office cannot remain 
vacant any longer—7 years. 
How many times have you heard the 
statement: ‘‘We don’t need any gun 
laws. We just need to enforce the laws 
that are already on the books’’? Well, 
one of the Agencies that have major ju-
risdiction is Alcohol, Tobacco, Fire-
arms and Explosives. 
It is no coincidence since it has been 
7 years since there has been a person in 
charge of that Agency. You need some-
one to guide the Agency to enforce the 
laws to keep our streets safe. That is 
very basic. 
Well, we made a gesture toward that 
this morning in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. Today, we voted for dis-
charge. The Senate will take a critical 
step toward confirming Mr. Dettelbach. 
He is the kind of leader our Nation 
needs to get a handle on the crisis of 
gun violence. Later today, we will have 
a vote on the floor here. I hope we can 
get 
bipartisan 
support 
for 
Mr. 
Dettelbach. 
Members of law enforcement, mayors 
across America, and former Federal 
prosecutors all agree that it is time 
that this man, Steve Dettelbach, be-
come the Director of the ATF. More 
than 140 former Justice Department of-
ficials, including multiple Trump ad-
ministration appointees, have stepped 
forward to voice their support for Mr. 
Dettelbach’s nomination. The Judici-
ary Committee has also received let-
ters of support from multiple former 
Directors and Acting Directors of the 
ATF. 
It is no surprise. As a career prosecutor, 
Mr. Dettelbach has devoted decades of his 
life to working alongside law enforcement, 
including ATF agents, to combat gang vio-
lence, gun crimes, and hate crimes. In every 
role he has held, Mr. Dettelbach has been 
squarely focused on protecting the lives of 
law enforcement officers and the families 
they serve. 
In his own words: 
Politics can play no role in law enforce-
ment. 
He has earned the trust of an amaz-
ing list of law enforcement organiza-
tions. Listen to the groups that sup-
port his taking on this job: The Na-
tional Sheriffs’ Association, the Inter-
national Association of Chiefs of Po-
lice, the Major County Sheriffs of 
America, the National Organization of 
Black Law Enforcement Executives, 
the Federal Law Enforcement Officers 
Association, Women in Federal Law 
Enforcement, the Hispanic American 
Police Command Officers Association, 
and many, many more. 
When a mass shooter tears apart a 
community 
like 
Buffalo, 
NY, 
or 
Uvalde, TX, ATF agents are among the 
first Federal officers to respond. Let us 
not wait a minute longer in providing 
these heroic agents the leader they de-
serve. Yes, let’s enforce the laws that 
are on the books. Let’s put together 
the leadership of the ATF to make cer-
tain that is done. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
voting for Steve Dettelbach’s con-
firmation on the floor of the Senate 
today. It is timely, it is important, and 
it is long overdue. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to speak for up to 15 minutes, Senator 
MORAN for up to 7 minutes, and Sen-
ator TESTER for up to 10 minutes prior 
to the scheduled rollcall votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. ARMY 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
begin, I would like to take a brief mo-
ment to wish the U.S. Army a happy 
247th birthday. 
I had the special honor this morning 
to ‘‘fall in’’ with Secretary of the Army 
Wormuth, 
Army 
Chief 
of 
Staff 
McConville, Sergeant Major of the 
Army Grinston, many other Army 
leaders, and hundreds of soldiers for 
some morning PT. 
I appreciated the opportunity to join 
in the Army tradition of a birthday 
formation run, and it was especially 
humbling to run through the hallowed 
grounds of Arlington National Ceme-
tery. 
Any time you are in Arlington—or 
any national cemetery in the States, 
like the Black Hills National Cemetery 
in South Dakota, or overseas, like the 
Normandy 
American 
Cemetery—you 
are reminded of the sacrifice and leg-
acy of our Nation’s warfighters. Every 
name and pair of dates on a headstone 
tells a unique story of selfless service 
to our Nation. 
In running over the hills and around 
the turns this morning, you get a bet-
ter sense of the magnitude of the more 
than 400,000 Americans who are hon-
ored at Arlington and the collective 
sacrifice of all of America’s heroes. 
Today, the U.S. Army proudly carries 
on the heritage and legacy established 
on June 14, 1775. Our soldiers and all 
our men and women in uniform stand 
guard around the world to protect our 
freedoms, and they make any adver-
sary think twice about threatening 
them, as the U.S. Army has done for 
the past 247 years. 
Thank you for all of your service to 
our country, your professionalism, and 
determination, and thank you for in-
cluding me today. Happy birthday to 
the U.S. Army.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2988 
June 16, 2022 
Commerce Committee and as a resi-
dent of a rural State, I have long been 
focused on expanding rural broadband 
access and ensuring that the benefits of 
the next wave of mobile broadband, 5G, 
are fully realized in rural communities. 
Expanding rule broadband access has 
been embraced by Members on both 
sides of the aisle, and Congress has ap-
propriated billions of dollars in recent 
years to ensure that rural communities 
are able to access fixed broadband. It is 
encouraging to see Members on both 
sides of the aisle supporting this goal, 
but there are problems. While, as I 
said, Congress has appropriated billions 
of dollars toward this goal, the Federal 
Government 
lacks 
an 
overarching 
broadband strategy. 
As a recent Government Account-
ability Office report highlighted, rural 
broadband funding is spread out over 15 
separate Agencies and more than 130 
separate programs in our government. 
That doesn’t exactly make for out-
standing efficiency or coordination. 
What it does make for is wasted tax-
payer dollars and slower progress in en-
suring that our rural communities 
have access to broadband. 
Last week, the Senate Commerce 
Committee’s 
Communications 
Sub-
committee, of which I serve as ranking 
member, held an oversight hearing on 
one of the leading Agencies charged 
with expanding rural broadband access 
and promoting wireless access, the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration, or the acro-
nym is NTIA. I appreciated Assistant 
Secretary Davidson coming to testify 
before the committee. 
Last year, Congress passed the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act, 
which provided billions of dollars to 
NTIA to deploy broadband services to 
unserved areas throughout the United 
States. At the time the bill was de-
bated, I raised a number of concerns 
about NTIA’s ability to effectively and 
efficiently manage such substantial 
funding, given NTIA’s past history on 
expanding rural broadband services. 
The last time Congress provided NTIA 
with broadband funding—a fraction, I 
might add, of the funding it is now re-
sponsible for—the Agency struggled 
with implementation and ended up 
overbuilding existing broadband net-
works, resulting in billions of taxpayer 
dollars being spent with little to show. 
And I have to say, I have not seen a lot 
to convince me that NTIA will do a 
better job this time around. 
Last month, NTIA released its Notice 
of 
Funding 
Opportunity 
for 
the 
Broadband Equity, Access, and Deploy-
ment—or BEAD—Program. The notice 
contains a number of troubling compo-
nents. To begin with, I am concerned 
that NTIA is planning to base its fund-
ing allocations on maps that don’t ac-
curately reflect which areas of the 
country are unserved. This creates a 
substantial risk of misallocating the 
funding Congress appropriated and, 
once again, overbuilding existing net-
works at the taxpayers’ expense. 
NTIA’s notice also makes clear that 
when it comes to expanding networks, 
they are planning to favor certain ap-
plicants; specifically, government-run 
networks 
and 
nontraditional 
broadband providers—entities with no 
proven 
track 
record 
in 
deploying 
broadband networks. 
What NTIA should be doing is taking 
a neutral approach that allows equal 
participation 
from 
all 
types 
of 
broadband providers, as long as they 
meet the technical, financial, and oper-
ational standards to deploy networks. 
Finally, especially at a time of 
record high inflation, the last thing 
any Agency should be doing is pursuing 
extraneous political goals that will ul-
timately increase the cost for providers 
who are deploying networks. I am dis-
appointed that NTIA, like other Fed-
eral Agencies under this administra-
tion, is seeking to score political 
points with certain constituencies—in 
this case, by leaning into net neu-
trality requirements, promoting bur-
densome labor standards, and focusing 
upon climate change initiatives. 
NTIA’s focus on requiring broadband 
providers to use a unionized workforce 
or project labor agreement not only 
puts providers that do not use union 
workforces at a disadvantage, but it is 
unworkable—unworkable—for 
pro-
viders in rural communities like those 
in South Dakota that simply don’t 
have access to a unionized workforce. 
Earlier this month, I heard firsthand 
from the folks who are building out 
networks in my home State of South 
Dakota about the challenges they face 
with respect to supply chain shortages 
and increased construction costs, and 
including unnecessary requirements in 
broadband contracts will only exacer-
bate that problem. 
I will continue to urge NTIA to work 
with States to reduce, rather than in-
crease, regulatory burdens so that the 
funding Congress provided could be 
used to provide broadband access to as 
many Americans as possible. 
I also continue to work on other 
measures to expand broadband access 
in rural communities, including the 
Reforming 
Broadband 
Connectivity 
Act, which I joined colleagues from 
both parties to introduce last year. 
This legislation will help guarantee a 
stable funding stream for the Federal 
Communication 
Commission’s 
Uni-
versal Service Fund, which promotes 
universal access to broadband and 
other 
telecommunications 
services. 
And I am hoping—I am hoping—we can 
get this legislation enacted into law 
this year. 
Having reliable rural fixed broadband 
services is also key in ensuring that 
rural communities are able to access 
the next wave of mobile broadband 
internet, 5G, and I am committed to 
smoothing the path for 5G services. 
Mr. President, 5G offers tremendous 
potential 
for 
rural 
communities, 
whether it is better access to tele-
health or the opportunity to imple-
ment precision agriculture. And we 
need to ensure that we build out 5G 
networks not just in cities and in sub-
urbs but in rural communities across 
the United States. 
I have introduced a number of bills to 
help keep the United States at the 
forefront of the 5G revolution and en-
sure that 5G technology makes its way 
to rural communities. 
My STREAMLINE Act, for example, 
would expedite the deployment of the 
small cells that are needed for 5G in-
stallation, while respecting the role of 
State and local governments in making 
deployment 
decisions. 
And, 
impor-
tantly, it would make it more afford-
able to bring 5G to rural areas by ad-
dressing the costs of small cell deploy-
ment. 
On the spectrum side of the equation, 
this year, I introduced the Spectrum 
Innovation Act, along with the Com-
munications Subcommittee chair, Sen-
ator LUJA´ N, to free up additional 
midband spectrum for 5G deployment, 
an action that will simultaneously im-
prove 5G coverage and bring in revenue 
for deficit reduction. 
Since freeing up additional spectrum 
requires proper coordination between 
NTIA, the FCC, and other Federal 
Agencies, I joined Senators WICKER, 
BLACKBURN, and LUJA´ N
to introduce 
the Improving Spectrum Coordination 
Act to ensure that our Federal part-
ners are effectively managing our Na-
tion’s airwaves. 
On the workforce side of things, my 
Telecommunications 
Skilled 
Work-
force Act, which was enacted into law 
last year, is designed to help increase 
the number of workers enrolled in 5G 
training 
programs 
and 
identifying 
ways to grow the telecommunications 
workforce to meet the demands of 5G. 
I will continue to work to support 
every part of the 5G equation—from 
physical technology to spectrum, to a 
5G 
workforce—so 
that 
the 
United 
States can stay at the forefront of this 
internet revolution. I will also con-
tinue to make fixed broadband and 5G 
access in rural communities a priority. 
Too often, rural areas, like those in 
my home State of South Dakota, have 
lagged behind when it comes to getting 
the most modern internet technology, 
and I am committed to ensuring that 
the full benefits of next-generation 
technologies make their way to rural 
communities. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
H.R. 3967 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, thank 
you for that emphatic recognition. 
In the next few minutes, the Senate 
will vote on the Sergeant First Class 
Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise 
to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act 
of 2022. 
This is a significant—I would say his-
toric—moment. This bipartisan legisla-
tion, not only is it significant and im-
portant because of the content, but it 
is also significant and perhaps historic 
because of the cooperation that has

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2989 
June 16, 2022 
been garnered to put this act together 
and presumably pass it and send it to 
the President of the United States. 
This bipartisan legislation is the 
most comprehensive toxic exposure 
package the Senate has ever delivered 
to veterans in our country’s history. 
Generation after generation, Ameri-
cans, one by one, have answered the 
call of duty with the promise that we— 
the United States of America, the citi-
zens of this country—would take care 
of them and their families after their 
time in uniform. Yet generation after 
generation, 
veteran 
after 
veteran, 
these servicemembers returned home 
only to be met with a piecemeal proc-
ess as they work to cobble together the 
care that they earned and the benefits 
they deserved from the Department of 
Veterans Affairs. 
Veterans have spent years fighting 
bureaucracy to get the care they need, 
and, sadly, there are those who have 
been fighting, up to this point, who are 
no longer living, to receive the benefits 
that this legislation will provide. 
Chairman TESTER, the Senator from 
Montana, and I made a commitment to 
get to this point today. I am proud that 
we are doing so together in a bipar-
tisan way. And, most importantly, this 
bill will deliver healthcare and benefits 
to thousands of veterans who are ill 
due to their exposure to burn pits and 
other toxic exposures. 
There is no doubt that the cost of 
taking care of our veterans is high, but 
the truth is freedom is not free. We say 
that. This is evidence that we believe 
that, upon the passage of this legisla-
tion. 
There is always, always a cost to 
war. It is always high. It is always dra-
matic. It is always something that 
costs people their lives. But we make a 
decision when we send those service 
men and women to war that we are 
going to do what we said we are going 
to do and care for them. The decision is 
made when we send someone to war 
about whether we are going to spend 
money to care for them when they re-
turn. The cost of war is not fully paid 
when the war is over. 
We are now on the verge of honoring 
that commitment to America’s vet-
erans and their families. Back home in 
Kansas, MG Lee Tafanelli said this leg-
islation ‘‘will have a great impact in 
the lives of our veterans long after 
their service. The knowledge that the 
obstacles formerly in their way have 
now been streamlined will provide 
peace of mind as our veterans move on 
with their lives.’’ 
I spoke on Memorial Day at a ceme-
tery in Kansas, and a Navy veteran 
came up to me after my remarks and 
said: I served in the Navy. My dad 
served in the Navy. We both encoun-
tered toxic substances, and we are for-
tunate we have no symptoms that 
cause any problems in our lives, but 
that doesn’t mean we don’t think about 
it every day; that what happens if we 
do have those consequences in the fu-
ture and there is nothing there for us 
and, more importantly, for our fami-
lies. 
This legislation helps provide some 
level of certainty. I am sure every 
member of our service, when they serve 
our Nation, recognizes they run risks, 
but I doubt that any of them believe 
that they are creating risks for their 
spouses or their children. They carry 
the burden for themselves, but there is 
also the necessity of caring for their 
families, particularly if they get to a 
point at which they cannot do so. 
Not only will this legislation provide 
long-overdue healthcare and benefits 
to the 3.5 million post-9/11 veterans 
who were exposed to burn pits, but this 
legislation will deliver care for all gen-
erations of veterans, including Viet-
nam veterans suffering from exposure 
to Agent Orange. 
I am at an age at which it would 
seem like the Vietnam war was a long 
time ago and we would have taken care 
of those who served, but we have those 
who served in Vietnam who are still 
waiting for their benefits. 
The Sergeant First Class Heath Rob-
inson PACT Act would not be on the 
floor today without the hard work of 
numerous veterans service organiza-
tions, veteran families, survivors, ad-
vocates, and the veterans themselves 
who came to Washington to meet with 
Senator TESTER and with me and with 
every Member of the U.S. Senate, to 
have a conversation, to tell their story. 
And they are the most effective advo-
cates there could be. And many of 
them, and others, testified before our 
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. 
This legislation is not just a product 
of Senator TESTER’s and mine; it is a 
product of so many. It is so much 
more. And perhaps—no offense to Sen-
ator TESTER, but perhaps our role is 
really insignificant when you look at 
the people who have encountered these 
challenges but used those challenges as 
an opportunity to fight not just for 
themselves but, in most instances, 
probably more likely to fight for other 
veterans in similar circumstances. 
I thank them for their service. I 
thank them for their work in helping 
us deliver long-lasting solutions and 
comprehensive reforms for those who 
served. And I especially want to thank 
Heath Robinson’s family, who turned 
their own loss and heartache into ac-
tion. This bill will help many veterans 
like Heath face the challenges that he 
faced that ultimately ended his life. 
I thank Senator TESTER, the chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs. And for all the members 
of our committees, Republicans and 
Democrats, I remind my colleagues and 
I remind the American people that the 
original version of this bill passed the 
Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
unanimously, with every Republican 
and every Democrat voting yes. 
After the passage of that legislation, 
we worked further to find consensus 
but, more importantly, to find better 
solutions and a path forward that 
would allow us to be to the point we 
are today. Secretary McDonough de-
serves our gratitude as well, and I 
thank him for his input, his testimony, 
and the numerous, numerous telephone 
and personal conversations. I appre-
ciate his advice, and it made this bill 
better for veterans. 
Once we pass this legislation, the 
real work of implementing it will fall 
to the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
But we as a committee and we as Sen-
ators need to make certain that we do 
the appropriate oversight, that we 
make certain that these are not just 
words on paper but that the results 
that we are looking for are finally de-
livered. 
Too often, I think, the moment of 
glory comes on the passage of a bill or 
the press release announcing the pas-
sage of a bill, the signing of a bill, but 
whether or not it works still remains 
the most important aspect of our work. 
A lot of work remains, and the VA has 
significant challenges as it moves for-
ward to help these veterans. The real 
work is still ahead of us, and I stand 
ready to do all I can to make certain 
that we are able to deliver the intended 
results contemplated by this legisla-
tion. 
A long list of thank-yous to my col-
leagues, certainly to my colleagues on 
the committee, my colleagues in the 
Senate, but especially to folks in the 
VA community, the VSO community: 
Shane 
Liermann, 
Lawrence 
Montreuil—Shane is with the DAV; 
Lawrence is with the American Le-
gion—Pat 
Murray 
with 
the 
VFW; 
Kristina Keenan, VFW; Cory Titus, 
MOAA; Aleks Morosky, WWP; Candace 
Wheeler, TAPS; Bob Carey, Independ-
ence

Tom 
Porter, 
IAVA; 
Kaitlynne 
Hetrick, 
IAVA; 
Jennifer 
Burch, IAVA; Rosie Torres, Burn Pits 
360; Jon Stewart; and Jon Feal. 
And I thank the Kansas leaders who, 
over a long period of time—I don’t 
know what year it was, but the Viet-
nam Veterans of America held a con-
ference in Wichita, KS, which I at-
tended, at which the topic was toxic 
exposure. And it has to be at least 10, 
12 years ago. And I thank them for, at 
that point in time, sticking in my 
mind that there is work to be done. 
And I appreciate other Kansans: Lee 
Hursey, who is the commander of the 
Kansas VFW; Jeremy Ehart of the Kan-
sas American Legion; William Turner; 
Eric Owens; Lee Tafanelli; David Den-
nis; GEN Mike Dodson; Pat Proctor; 
Paul Chapa; COL Timothy Marlar; and 
COL John Buckley, all of whom are 
Kansans who are working on behalf of 
other veterans in our State to see that 
we get this right. 
And nothing in this body gets done 
because Senators do all the work. Sen-
ators have ideas and occasionally a few 
words here and there, but we are sur-
rounded by people who every day make 
those words and those thoughts come 
to life on a piece of paper called a bill. 
And my staff on the Senate Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee and in my office 
have been unending in their efforts to

JERRY MORAN but for the veterans of

and encountered things they should 
not

con-
sequences 
of 
which 
have 
lasted 
throughout their lives. We are here to 
fulfill a commitment and a promise, 
and we begin that, we move forward on 
that today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator MORAN for his com-
ments. I didn’t hear everything he had 
to say, but when I came in, one of the 
things he said was we may not be the 
most important people in this process. 
And he is 100 percent correct. We are 
simply the conduit that was utilized to 
get this bill put into law. 
There are way, way too many people 
to thank on this legislation, and I am 
going to get to that. And I will forget 
a bunch of folks, and I apologize right 
now. 
But the truth is, we today, the U.S. 
Senate today, has the opportunity to 
make history by passing the Sergeant 
First Class Heath Robinson Honoring 
our Promise to Address Comprehensive 
Toxics—PACT—Act. 
This is not a new issue. Generations 
after generations of Americans have 
gone to war backed by a promise that 
we made to them when they signed up 
that we would care for them when they 
got home. Unfortunately, that didn’t 
happen in the case of toxic exposure. 
We failed them. 
This bill is about righting a wrong 
that has been ignored for just way too 
damn long. It is about Will Thompson. 
It is about SFC Heath Robinson. It is 
about every American who has lost 
their lives through toxic exposures be-
cause of the duty that they have per-
formed for this country. 
Sadly, it is too late to do right by 
Will and Heath and so many others, 
but today, this body has a chance to do 
the right thing by their families and 
future generations of our All-Volunteer 
military by passing the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson Honoring our 
PACT Act. 
The days of ignoring the wounds 
from toxic exposure, wounds not seen 
until years after those days are gone— 
conditions 
like 
hypertension 
and 
MGUS found in veterans like Robert 
Hunter, a proud Montanan who served 
in the Army as an engineering officer 
during the Vietnam war. Robert was 
exposed to Agent Orange during his 
service and contracted MGUS years 
later. He is one of the 66,000 veterans in 
Montana who would become eligible for 
relief under this bill—not to mention 
every post-9/11 veteran in this country 
who would automatically receive VA 
healthcare. This includes more than 3.5 
million post-9/11 combat veterans ex-
posed to burn pits in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. 
This bill would also remove the bur-
den of proof for 23 presumptive condi-
tions caused by military toxic expo-
sures, from cancers to lung disease, and 
it would codify a more transparent 
framework to establish future pre-
sumptions of service connections to en-
sure future generations of veterans are 
treated more fairly than the last. And 
probably, most importantly, it will 
allow the VA to make the decisions on 
toxic exposures instead of an act of 
Congress. 
In short, the PACT Act will allow 
hundreds of thousands of veterans 
across the country to access the VA 
care that they have been denied and 
give them the benefits that they have 
earned. Make no mistake, the VA will 
be given the tools it needs to hire more 
medical professionals and claims proc-
essors, establish more healthcare fa-
cilities and improve claims processing, 
ensuring we are meeting the needs of 
our veterans today, tomorrow, and in 
the future. 
The bottom line is this country is 
very capable of recognizing the phys-
ical, obvious wounds of war—a lost 
limb, a chemical burn—and we are tak-
ing the steps to recognize the mental 
wounds of war, but we haven’t been 
recognizing the toxic wounds of war, 
and that will end today with the pas-
sage of this bill. 
As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee—and I have said 
this many times to the veterans serv-
ice organizations—I take my cues from 
them, the veterans they represent. 
When I first introduced the COST of 
War Act last year, together we set out 
with a clear goal, a goal to right the 
wrongs of decades of inactions and fail-
ure—by us, by our government—to pro-
vide all areas of toxic-exposed veterans 
the VA care and benefits they need and 
that they have earned. 
We knew this was the only way to do 
this—was to put forth a package that 
took care of our past, present, and fu-
ture veterans. I am grateful—and I 
mean this because folks always talk 
about good friends on the Senate floor. 
Sometimes, they mean it; sometimes, 
they don’t. I mean it. Thank you to my 
good friend Ranking Member JERRY 
MORAN for working with me, with the 
committee, for creating an environ-
ment so our staffs could work together 
to create this new, bipartisan toxic ex-
posure strategy. 
And for my colleagues on the Senate 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, particu-
larly my friends like Senator JOHN 
BOOZMAN and Senator SHERROD BROWN, 
thank you. 
I am thankful for the leadership of 
President Biden and VA Secretary 
Denis McDonough, along with House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman 
TAKANO, and so many, many others 
who are here today. 
This bill is the legislation we envi-
sioned when we set out to right the 
wrongs of our toxic-exposed vets. 
This bill recognizes the cost of war. 
It is the bill our veterans and our fami-
lies deserve and are counting on and 
cannot wait any longer for. Veterans 
and veterans service organizations and 
advocates have understood this for a 
long time. And they have been incred-
ible partners since the beginning, and I 
look forward to thanking each and 
every one of them in the days and the 
weeks to come. 
I want to speak directly to them 
now: I am grateful for your efforts. I 
am grateful for your voices—for never 
taking your foot off the gas—and con-
tinuing to push Members of Congress 
to simply do the right thing. 
I also want to acknowledge the 
countless hours put in by the staffs 
from both sides of the aisle—and Sen-
ator MORAN is exactly correct, we take 
credit for their good work; and they do 
good work—staff from my office, like 
staff director Tony McClain, as well as 
this guy right here to my left, Simon 
Coon, Dahlia Melendrez, James Cho, 
Janko Mitric, Tess Wrzesinski, Shauna 
Rust, 
Olya 
Voytovich, 
and 
Liz 
Timmons but also folks across the 
aisle, like Lindsay Dearing, Jon Tow-
ers, Asher Allman, Tom Brandt, Pat 
McGuigan, Michelle Dominguez, Dili 
Sundaramoorthy, and Mike Jones. 
Look, by sitting down in a bipartisan 
way to get this bill crafted, we were 
able to have success and get the job 
done, and that is what the folks who 
sent us here expect us to do. America’s 
veterans and their loved ones will be 
better off as a result of this work 
today, and the result of that will make 
this country a better place. 
There is always a cost of war, and 
that cost is never fully repaid when the 
war ends. So I have got one question: 
Are we willing to show these millions 
of veterans that we have their back, 
that the U.S. Government has their 
back? Are we willing to admit that we 
didn’t live up to the promise of vet-
erans like Will Thompson and Heath 
Robinson? 
But the fact is, I believe today will 
show that we can put party politics 
aside and honor America’s bravest. We 
can honor the plea of Heath’s 8-year- 
old daughter Brielle to ‘‘Fight for the 
heroes who fought for our country and 
pass my dad’s bill, the Sergeant First 
Class Heath Robinson PACT Act.’’ And 
we can begin settling our debts to mil-
lions of other veterans and their fami-
lies today. 
The last thing is, what I am going to 
close with, that the work is not over 
with, assuming this bill passes today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2991 
June 16, 2022 
The ranking member is 100 percent cor-
rect: We are going to have a lot of over-
sight to do to make sure that the vet-
erans get the healthcare and the bene-
fits that they have earned and that 
they deserve. That is the congressional 
intent that we have with this bill. So 
oversight will be critically important. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is 
the 
greatest 
advance 
in 
veterans’ 
healthcare in decades. It wouldn’t have 
happened without JERRY MORAN and 
the amazing work of Chairman JON 
TESTER who persisted through so many 
different turns and twists and difficul-
ties. Every veteran in America, every 
American, 
should 
give 
tremendous 
thanks to Senator TESTER and Senator 
MORAN. 
I yield the floor and urge a vote.

The bill (H.R. 3967) as amended, was 
passed. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the pas-
sage of the Sergeant First Class Heath 
Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Ad-
dress Comprehensive Toxics Act of 
2022, or PACT Act, is an example of 
what can happen when the Congress 
puts aside partisanship and comes to-
gether for the good of the country and, 
importantly, our veterans. 
Each of us, in every State and in 
every congressional district across the 
country, has a friend, a neighbor, or a 
constituent, a veteran, or an Active- 
Duty servicemember, who has become 
sick or died from exposure to toxics 
while serving in the military. And for 
too many of those people, recognition 
of the connection between their ill-
nesses and toxic exposures came too 
late. 
Early in my time in the Senate, I 
heard from Vietnam veterans who were 
sickened by exposure to herbicides 
such as Agent Orange. Too many of 
these veterans died before Congress 
pushed the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs to recognize and treat their ill-
nesses or compensate them for the dis-
ability caused by our own govern-
ment’s use of such a toxic substance 
throughout Vietnam and in other parts 
of Southeast Asia. 
I hoped we would have learned from 
our mistakes there. I hoped we would 
learn from the veterans and civilians 
who suffered from radiation exposure 
when we tested the atomic bomb. I 
hoped we would learn from the vet-
erans who came home from the first 
Gulf War with unexplained illnesses. 
But just a few years ago, I watched 
my dear friend, BG Mike Heston, rav-
aged by pancreatic cancer, fight for the 
VA and the Department of Defense to 
acknowledge 
that 
his 
cancer 
was 
caused by exposure to the burn pits 
that had been used during his tours in 
Afghanistan. 
Mike served as a Vermont State 
trooper for 26 years and for 33 years in 
the military, including in the Marine 
Corps Reserve and the Vermont Na-
tional Guard. He served his State and 
his country without question. When he 
got sick, he should not have had to 
spend his precious remaining time 
fighting for the government to ac-
knowledge what caused his illness. 
But Mike did fight. Mike fought to 
ensure that his family, his two wonder-
ful children, Kelsey and Keegan, would 
be cared for if he succumbed to his ill-
ness. He and his wife June also fought 
to make sure that other veterans 
would not have to endure what they 
did, that they might get an earlier di-
agnosis, that they might not have to 
spend any of their precious moments 
fighting for the benefits they earned. 
After Mike passed away in 2018, June 
continued and expanded the fight. 
Joining her in Vermont were Staff Ser-
geant Wesley Black, who died last year 
of colon cancer at the age of 36, leaving 
behind his wife Laura and son Ronan; 
Pat Cram, widow of Sergeant Major 
Mike Cram, who died of prostate can-
cer at the age of 47; and many others 
who through their experience with 
friends or loved ones were determined 
to make sure that things would be bet-
ter for those who followed. 
As we stand here today prepared to 
enact one of the most sweeping pack-
ages 
of 
veterans 
benefits 
and 
healthcare measures in modern his-
tory, I am thinking of Mike and June, 
of Kelsey and Keegan, of Mike and Pat, 
and of Wesley and Laura and Ronan. 
And I know that each Senator voting 
yes today is thinking of people in their 
States and districts who are sick or 
who have died as a result of exposure 
to toxics while serving our country. 
Their stories are meaningful, and 
they, themselves, ensured that their 
sacrifice is meaningful, too. And I hope 
that this time we will learn from our 
experiences with toxic substances and 
hold the Department of Defense to a 
higher standard in the future.

NOMINATION OF ANA ISABEL DE ALBA 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
work period, the Senate will continue 
to confirm highly qualified, diverse 
nominees to the Federal judiciary. 
First on the list is Judge Ana Isabel 
de Alba, who has been nominated to 
the U.S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of California. 
A San Joaquin Valley native, Judge 
de Alba has served as a Superior Court 
Judge for Fresno County, CA, since 
2018. She has presided over thousands 
of hearings and more than seven bench 
trials before the court’s Criminal Mis-
demeanor Division, the Juvenile Jus-
tice Division, and the Environmental 
Quality Act Panel. 
Prior to her judicial service, Judge de 
Alba practiced for 11 years at a Fresno- 
area law firm, where she became part-
ner in just 5 years and specialized in 
business, employment, construction, 
and personal injury law. In addition to 
her expansive litigation practice before 
California State courts, Judge de Alba 
handled 
many 
administrative 
law 
trials before a State agency as well as 
a Federal jury trial. 
Judge de Alba earned her B.A. with 
highest honors and her J.D. from the 
University of California at Berkeley. 
The American Bar Association has 
unanimously rated Judge de Alba as 
‘‘Qualified’’ to serve on the Eastern 
District of California, and she also has 
received the strong support of her 
home State Senators, Mrs. FEINSTEIN 
and Mr. PADILLA. 
With her record of fair-minded judi-
cial service and years of litigation ex-
perience, Judge de Alba will serve her 
home district well as a Federal district 
court judge.

MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we 
await completion of the gun safety bill, 
today, the Senate is taking another 
important step to protect communities 
from gun violence, moving forward 
with 
the 
nomination 
of 
Steven 
Dettelbach, to be Director of the Bu-
reau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives. 
In a few moments, I will move to dis-
charge Mr. Dettelbach’s nomination 
from the Judiciary Committee. After 
that, I am going to make sure his nom-
ination moves through this Chamber 
rapidly. 
The bipartisan gun safety legislation 
currently being negotiated is crucially 
important but so is having a fully 
staffed ATF. And my colleagues, listen 
to this: We haven’t had a Director of 
ATF since 2015. Gun violence is ripping 
through the Nation, killing so many, 
and we still don’t have a Director of 
ATF. That is just outrageous, at a time 
when we need one more than ever.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2993 
June 16, 2022 
At a time when Americans are sick 
and tired of our country’s gun violence 
epidemic, we should be sprinting— 
sprinting—to confirm someone whose 
job would be precisely to keep Ameri-
cans safe from gun violence, and that is 
exactly what the new ATF Director 
will do. 
The ATF may not always capture the 
spotlight, but it is vital in stopping 
gun trafficking, in preventing illegal 
possession of firearms, and making 
sure our kids can’t get their hands on 
dangerous weapons. 
It is still so confounding to realize we 
haven’t had somebody there because 
people have blocked it since 2015. An 
organization as important as the ATF 
absolutely needs to have a Senate-con-
firmed Director in place, and though 
we haven’t had one in 7 years, we are 
going to change that very, very soon. 
Having a strong, qualified nomina-
tion like Dettelbach will certainly help 
reduce the scourge of gun violence in 
the country. 
So, once again, after I move to dis-
charge Mr. Dettelbach, I am going to 
make sure his nomination moves rap-
idly through this Chamber. We need to 
fill this vacancy that has been blocked 
by the other side far too often. 
Now, pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary being tied on 
the question of reporting, I move to 
discharge the Committee on the Judi-
ciary from further consideration of 
Steven M. Dettelbach, of Ohio, to be 
Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, To-
bacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
The Senator from New Jersey is rec-
ognized. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2340 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor once again today to 
seek unanimous consent for the pas-
sage of the Daniel Anderl Judicial Se-
curity and Privacy Act of 2021. 
I say ‘‘once again’’ because a little 
over a month ago, I came to the floor 
seeking unanimous consent for this 
same exact bill, which was reported out 
of the Senate Judiciary Committee 
last December with overwhelming bi-
partisan support and whose namesake 
is Daniel Anderl, the 20-year-old son of 
U.S. District Court Judge Esther Salas. 
Judge Salas is in the Gallery today, 
hoping we can come together as a body 
to deliver real solutions to honor her 
family by ensuring that no Federal 
judge or their family experience the 
same violence that she and her family 
faced. 
Mr. President, 1 year, 10 months, and 
27 days ago, her son Daniel was bru-
tally murdered by a gunman who tar-
geted Judge Salas for her gender, her 
ethnicity, and because he could not ac-
cept her judgment in a case that 
reached her court. Every single day 
since July 19, 2020, Judge Salas and her 
husband Mark have endured the im-
mense grief of burying their only son. 
No parent should have to experience 
such a devastating loss. Yet, in the 
face of so much pain, Judge Salas has 
channeled this into purpose, embarking 
on a personal mission to increase the 
safety and privacy of her fellow judges 
and their families. 
The murderer was able to carry out 
this horrific hate crime using publicly 
available information, tracking down 
Judge Salas to her home in New Jer-
sey, gravely injuring her husband, and 
murdering Daniel in cold blood when 
he answered the door. 
As I said the last time I came to the 
floor seeking unanimous consent, no 
parent should have to experience such 
a devastating loss. But in the months 
since then and now, our country has 
seen the tragic results of inaction. On 
June 4, a retired county judge in Wis-
consin was shot and killed in his home 
by a gunman who appeared before his 
court, and just 4 days later, a man was 
arrested 
near 
Justice 
Kavanaugh’s 
home in Maryland after being found 
with a gun, a knife, and a plan to kill 
the Supreme Court Justice. Reports 
suggest the perpetrator found Justice 
Kavanaugh’s address online. 
We cannot take these events as iso-
lated incidents. The brutal murder of 
Judge Salas’s son, a horrific killing of 
a retired county judge in Wisconsin, 
and 
the 
attempt 
on 
Justice 
Kavanaugh’s life, demand that Con-
gress act to protect those who sit on 
the judiciary. Simply put, we must pre-
vent any other judge from having to 
endure the threats and senseless vio-
lence that these families have experi-
enced. 
After the horrific tragedy Judge 
Salas 
and 
Mark 
suffered, 
Senator 
BOOKER and I made personal commit-
ments 
to 
honor 
Daniel’s 
legacy 
through action. We told her we would 
not rest until we enacted greater pro-
tections for those who serve on the 
bench to protect any other judge from 
having to endure the senseless violence 
Judge Salas experienced. 
And it is important to protect this 
branch of our government because we 
want them to render decisions that are 
free from fear—free from fear—that 
they will render impartial justice free 
from fear of what may happen to them 
as a result of their judgment. We can 
make progress on that work today in 
this Chamber. 
The bipartisan bill I seek unanimous 
consent for is an effort I am proud to 
lead with 12 of my colleagues, includ-
ing Senators BOOKER, DURBIN, GRAHAM, 
KENNEDY, CRUZ, and GRASSLEY. Our bill 
will protect the personally identifiable 
information that assailants have used 
to target judges and their families. It 
is a commonsense measure that would 
authorize the U.S. Marshal Service to 
monitor online threats and deter fu-
ture attacks. It is so common sense 
that it was voted out of the Judiciary 
Committee with strong bipartisan sup-
port. I am talking about a 21-to-0 vote 
in the affirmative. It is so common 
sense that it should build on the work 
the Senate just did a month ago when 
it fast-tracked important safeguards 
for Supreme Court Justices and their 
families. 
I will say it again. Nearly a month 
ago, the Senate acted here in mere 
minutes to increase protections for Su-
preme Court Justices—protections that 
were proven to be necessary when po-
lice apprehended Judge Kavanaugh’s 
would-be assailant. 
Yesterday, our colleagues in the 
House of Representatives voted to pass 
that bill. Today, we should take steps 
to protect all Federal judges. There is 
simply no explanation or justification 
to protect Supreme Court Justices 
while delaying legislation to protect 
judges at every level of the judiciary 
who face the same, if not greater, 
risks. 
No judge in America should have to 
fear for their lives and the safety of 
their family as they work to uphold 
the Constitution, our democracy, and 
ensure all people have equal justice 
under the law. We have seen the con-
sequences of inaction over the previous 
month. But we have an opportunity to 
act in this moment and advance our bi-
partisan bill, the Daniel Anderl Judi-
cial Security and Privacy Act, which 
has continued to garner support. 
This isn’t a partisan issue. This bill 
is not about right or left; it is about 
right and wrong. 
Once again, I ask my Senate col-
leagues to let us honor the life and 
memory of Daniel Anderl with decisive 
action and results. Let’s do the right 
thing to honor Daniel’s legacy and 
unanimously 
pass 
this 
legislation 
named after him. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about the need for the 
Senate to act to protect Federal 
judges. 
In the past few years, the growing 
use of political violence has endan-
gered elected officials, police officers, 
flight attendants, school board mem-
bers, election workers, and judges. We 
all must condemn all violence and 
threats of violence against public offi-
cials in the strongest possible terms, 
regardless of whether it comes from 
the right or the left. 
Last week, news broke that an armed 
man was arrested near the home of Su-
preme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. 
This man made it clear to law enforce-
ment that he desired to kill Justice 
Kavanaugh. Importantly, court docu-
ments showed that the gunman outside 
Justice Kavanaugh’s home said he 
found the address online. 
This week, the House approved a bill 
that unanimously passed the Senate

June 16, 2022 
last month and would give the Su-
preme Court Police greater discretion 
to protect the Justices’ families. I am 
glad that this important legislation is 
headed to President Biden’s desk. 
But it has been over 6 months since 
the Judiciary Committee unanimously 
reported the Daniel Anderl Judicial Se-
curity and Privacy Act. This bill was 
first introduced by Senators MENENDEZ 
and BOOKER in response to a tragic in-
cident in which a disgruntled litigant 
found the home address of Judge Es-
ther Salas on the internet, went to her 
house, and shot and killed her son. 
The bill is directly responsive to the 
threats that Federal judges face, in-
cluding 
the 
threat 
to 
Justice 
Kavanaugh. It would allow judges to 
safeguard their personal information 
from being posted on the internet and 
would empower the judiciary to mon-
itor online threats. We have tried to 
pass this bill in the past, and it has 
been blocked by at least one Repub-
lican Senator. The bill’s sponsors have 
negotiated changes to address these 
concerns, and I am hopeful that Repub-
lican objection will be lifted today. 
The threat to Justice Kavanaugh and 
the tragic death of Daniel Anderl un-
derscore the need to pass this bipar-
tisan bill quickly and get it signed into 
law so we can protect all Federal 
judges and their families. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 190, S. 2340; further, that the com-
mittee-reported substitute amendment 
be withdrawn; that the Menendez sub-
stitute amendment at the desk be con-
sidered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, reserving 
the right to object, for a year and a 
half, we have been offering my col-
league a compromise in the passage of 
this bill. We could pass this bill today, 
immediately. All we have been asking 
is that it not only protect Federal 
judges but protect Members of Con-
gress as well. I haven’t heard a cogent 
or even any argument for why it 
couldn’t. 
It is a very simple compromise. To 
pass things unanimously takes com-
promise. It takes people coming to-
gether and people agreeing. But there 
hasn’t 
been 
any 
movement; 
there 
hasn’t been any compromise; and I am 
still open. We can pass this today to in-
clude Members of Congress. 
If recent years have taught us any-
thing, it is that members of the legisla-
tive branch need protection as well as 
those in the judiciary. That was clear 
in 2011 when Congresswoman Gabby 
Giffords was tragically shot while she 
was doing the most important part of 
her job—meeting with constituents. 
Words cannot express how happy and 
inspired I was to see that Congress-
woman Giffords was in the Chamber 
with her husband, Senator KELLY, 
when he was sworn in as a Member of 
this body. Well, words also cannot ex-
press the pain felt by the families of 
the people who were killed that day 
and wounded. That should have been a 
wake-up call to protect Members of 
Congress and, in doing so, to better 
protect the people around them. 
Yet, just a few years later, a shooter 
nearly killed Congressman STEVE SCA-
LISE during a practice for the charity 
baseball game. I was there. A young 
man was shot 10 feet from me. I said at 
the time that our lives were saved by 
the Capitol Police. Had they not been 
there, things could have been much 
worse. 
Extending the provisions of this bill 
to Members of Congress would better 
protect us and our families and our 
constituents. I have been offering this 
for 2 years. My amendment, which I 
will offer through unanimous consent, 
simply extends the same protections 
that it would offer to the judicial 
branch to the legislative branch. 
This is not a new request. In Decem-
ber of 2020, when we discussed this bill 
on the floor, I offered this compromise. 
I said I would work together with the 
other side to try to get a bill that we 
could pass. But we haven’t gotten any-
where. If we want this to pass, let’s 
compromise. Let’s come together and 
figure out a way that we can get this to 
pass. 
I know of no argument or no con-
stituency that is coming to Wash-
ington, saying: We don’t want Members 
of Congress to be protected. There is no 
such constituency. There is no such ar-
gument, and there is no reason we 
couldn’t pass this today. It has been al-
most 2 years. Let’s pass this bill today. 
As I have said over and over again, I 
support this bill and the provisions, 
and I don’t believe it ought to be 
blocked merely because Members of 
Congress also need protection. 
With that being said, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senator modify 
his request to include my amendment 
to the Menendez substitute amend-
ment, which is at the desk; that the 
amendments be considered and agreed 
to; that the bill, as amended, be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the modification? 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, in re-
serving the right to object, I think the 
points that the Senator from Kentucky 
is making are worthy. We are facing a 
reality right now wherein there are 
lots of threats that are increasing 
against public officials all around our 
country, and I understand that. 
This is not a bill that Senator 
MENENDEZ and I just wrote and brought 
to the floor. This is a bill that we 
worked through the committee proc-
ess. It was a long and arduous process 
that was done in a bipartisan manner. 
During the discussion that the com-
mittee had, the point that the Senator 
from Kentucky brought up was brought 
up as well. There is a real concern 
about the safety and security of the 
Members of this body. But with the un-
derstanding and the commitment that 
there would be a bipartisan effort to 
work on this issue, every Senator on 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
said 
we 
should let this go for right now. This 
bill has been vetted; it has been worked 
over in a bipartisan manner; and it is 
ready to pass. 
Threats on the Federal judiciary 
have gone up 500 percent. I will grant 
you, threats on Members of Congress 
have doubled, but the threats on the 
Federal judiciary are rising, and we 
saw 
that 
in 
the 
case 
of 
Justice 
Kavanaugh. 
This 
body 
thought 
it 
enough not to hold up the protection of 
Supreme Court Justices in order to 
protect the 535 of us, and we passed a 
bill to protect the Supreme Court Jus-
tices. 
So here we now have a bill that has 
been vetted in committee, that has 
been worked on in a bipartisan fashion, 
and has come out, and we have a com-
mitment. For the Senator from Ken-
tucky to say that nothing has been 
done is not right. We now have Senator 
TED CRUZ and Senator AMY KLOBUCHAR 
working a bill through committee, 
through regular order, to make sure 
that we address the concerns that he is 
having. 
This is my concern: Threats on the 
judiciary have gone up and are signifi-
cantly higher than on this body. To 
grind this bill to a halt right now puts 
at risk members of the judiciary when 
we have the power in this body to pro-
tect our brothers and sisters in that 
branch of government. 
Why would we stop when there is 
good will on the Judiciary Committee 
to work on the concerns? 
There are two people who are com-
mitted to this bill, and there are verbal 
commitments from everyone. To stop 
this today creates a window of vulnera-
bility that we know is real because we 
just saw a threat on a Supreme Court 
Justice. 
For the sake of mercy, for the sake of 
caution, for the sake of the protection 
of the people in the Federal judiciary, 
let’s pass this bill. I commit myself to 
joining with Senator TED CRUZ, to join-
ing with Senator AMY KLOBUCHAR, to 
joining with Chairman DURBIN
and 
with Ranking Member GRASSLEY, who 
have also spoken of their willingness to 
work a bill through regular order. That 
is what we should be doing. 
Our job as Senators, if anything, first 
and foremost, is to protect the lives of 
American citizens. We have a bill that 
is widely bipartisan, that has proven to 
be urgent—a bill with a name of a 
young man who was slaughtered in his 
home. To hold this bill up is cruel. It is 
creating risk and jeopardy to people 
who serve in the judiciary. It is wrong. 
It is wrong. It is wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2995 
June 16, 2022 
I ask my colleague, with all humility 
and with all compassion and empathy, 
to please let this go. I commit to him 
that I will fight and work with the bi-
partisan coalition that is working on 
ways to protect the people in this body. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the modification? 
The senior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, in 
reserving the right to object, for all of 
the reasons that Senator BOOKER just 
mentioned and with an equal commit-
ment to Senator PAUL to work with 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and Senator CRUZ, 
who are working on a bill to protect 
Members and who look to advocate for 
the Senator’s language to be included 
in that legislation, the Senator could 
have done this on the Supreme Court 
Justices, but he didn’t. 
So, at this point, I will have to ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection to the original request? 
The Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, in reserv-
ing the right to object, we have been 
trying for a year and a half. Our staff 
has offered to meet with the opposi-
tion’s staffs. We have not had one 
meeting. They have not accepted a 
meeting much less a compromise—a 
year and a half. 
This could pass today by simply ac-
cepting this. There is a promise to do it 
at a later date when we have waited a 
year and a half? A year and a half went 
by because no one would meet with us. 
We have not had one meeting. We have 
offered to meet with the staffs of both 
of the authors of this, and we have not 
been granted a meeting. There has been 
no discussion of this between staff and 
no discussion of a compromise. 
We would take a compromise. I don’t 
understand. There has been no argu-
ment made today as to why Congress 
couldn’t be added to this bill. They 
could have added this to the bill or 
talked to us over a year and a half. No 
one has talked to us. Other than to 
come for the public theater, no one has 
tried to get this thing passed. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The senior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
know the hour is late, but I am un-
aware of any such request, and I am 
unaware of our not being willing. Of 
course, we are willing. As a matter of 
fact, Judge Salas is here, and she tried 
to see Senator PAUL to make her case. 
He wouldn’t give her the time of day. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. President, I lit-
erally turned to my staff and asked: 
Has Senator PAUL’s staff reached out 
to us at all? 
That is not the case. 
Then, to characterize us as the oppo-
sition, we are not in opposition to this 
bill. We are trying to protect Federal 
judges as is the unanimous vote of the 
Judiciary Committee. 
So this is very frustrating that we 
should stop this for the Supreme Court 
Justices—the Senator has no objection 
to that—but, for some reason, not for 
the other members of the judiciary. I 
just find that problematic. 
I am willing to meet with the Sen-
ator. I am not in opposition to his bill. 
The meeting which would be had, I will 
do but with the two sponsors of the bill 
to protect the U.S. Senate. But to hold 
up the protection of other fellow citi-
zens because we are not getting protec-
tion, to me, does not mark the nobility 
of this body and the self-sacrifice of 
this body. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 
back all time on the motion to dis-
charge. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is yielded back.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-

The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, first, 
let me say that I am glad to see the 
successful 
discharge 
of 
Steven 
Dettelbach’s nomination. I have known 
him since he was a detailee for the De-
partment of Justice to the Judiciary 
Committee. I found him one of the 
hardest working, most talented, hon-
est, and evenhanded people I knew. I 
was happy to support him for U.S. at-
torney in Ohio. I can understand why 
so many law enforcement organiza-
tions backed him because of his values 
there. I will have more to say when he 
is confirmed, but it is a good move. 
NOMINATION OF BETH ROBINSON 
Madam President, Vermonters are no 
strangers to making history, and in 
November 2021, one Vermonter in par-
ticular made history again: the U.S. 
Senate confirmed Beth Robinson to a 
seat on the Second Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. She assumed her seat on that 
bench days later. I could not be more 
proud. Vermont has one seat on the 
Second Circuit Court of Appeals, so we 
always try to send our best. 
Judge Robinson embodies Vermont’s 
values: her commitment to justice and 
equality and her compassion for her 
fellow human beings. She has also 
proven to be an exceptional jurist, one 
dedicated to the rule of law above all 
else. There should be no doubt that she 
brings 
that 
same 
excellence 
to 
Vermont’s single seat on the Second 
Circuit, as a successor to my dear 
friend, the late Judge Peter Hall. 
Since Vermonters first elected me to 
the U.S. Senate, I have worked hard to 
ensure that Vermont’s best and bright-
est represent our State on the Federal 
judiciary. 
In 
2004, 
I 
recommended 
Judge Hall, then Vermont’s U.S. Attor-
ney and a Republican, to serve on the 
Second Circuit because he was the 
most qualified. During his 17-year ten-
ure on the panel, Judge Hall was a fine 
jurist. He was fair and kind to all liti-
gants before him, and was always hum-
ble. His passing, at just age 72, was a 
loss to not just Vermont, but also to 
the Federal judiciary at large. 
In 
2009, 
I 
proudly 
recommended 
Christina Reiss to be a judge for the 
District Court of Vermont. We have a 
very small district court with a State 
of our size. With her confirmation, 
Judge Reiss became the first woman to 
serve on the District Court of Vermont. 
And, like Judge Hall, she has served as 
a model of fairness and impartiality on 
the bench ever since. 
Judge Robinson is a trailblazer her-
self. As a tireless champion for LGBTQ 
rights, she successfully litigated the 
landmark Baker v. Vermont decision, 
which led to Vermont becoming the 
first ever State to enact civil unions in 
the United States. Beth’s advocacy 
served as a blueprint for the successful 
advancement of LGBTQ rights across 
the country, securing her place as one 
of the first pioneers in the national 
movement for LGBTQ rights. 
Her smart and steady approach and 
her unimpeachable reputation won her

ing yet another barrier. Now, today, 
Judge Robinson is the first openly gay 
female judge to serve in our Federal 
circuit courts. 
While 
on 
the 
Vermont 
Supreme 
Court, 
Judge 
Robinson 
seamlessly 
traded her advocate’s cap for that of an 
impartial jurist. She is a consensus 
builder. Her unwavering commitment 
to the neutral application of the law 
was second-to-none on the Vermont 
Supreme Court; it is a commitment I 
know she brings with her to the Second 
Circuit. 
When I recommended to President 
Biden that he nominate Beth Robinson 
to the Second Circuit, there was such 
an outpouring of support from all cor-
ners of Vermont. The membership of 
the Vermont Supreme Court—justices 
appointed by both Democratic and Re-
publican Governors—signed a strong 
letter of support for her nomination. 
They were joined by prominent Repub-
licans and Democrats from all around 
the State, underscoring just how wide-
ly respected she was for her reputation 
as an impartial and independent jurist. 
When Judge Robinson was confirmed 
in the Senate with bipartisan support, 
I celebrated. Judge Robinson is a 
Vermonter who has dedicated her life 
to the causes of justice and equality. 
She is a Vermonter who embodies our 
State’s highest ideals, who brings fair-
ness, independence, and integrity on 
the Second Circuit. 
Next week, along the shores of Lake 
Champlain, friends, family, State lead-
ers, fellow lawyers, and many more 
Vermonters will gather to celebrate 
the investiture of Vermont’s newest 
judge 
on 
the 
Second 
Circuit. 
Vermonters can be assured that Judge 
Robinson will continue to be guided by 
the same principles that have brought 
her this far. Marcelle and I are two 
Vermonters who are proud that, once 
again, we are breaking barriers and 
making history, now with the inves-
titure of Judge Beth Robinson on the 
Second Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I 
want to talk a little bit about the 
whole idea of loan forgiveness, student 
debt forgiveness. I have spoken many 
times on the floor about the impor-
tance of higher education—both college 
education 
and 
apprenticeships 
and 
other kinds of work preparation. I was 
the first person in my family to ever 
graduate from college, and later was 
the president of the university. And it 
is important, there is no doubt about 
that. 
I have often also talked about one of 
the reasons I think our system works 
so well is in post-World War II Amer-
ica, we have not tried to run higher 
education; we have tried to encourage 
and support higher education. 
You could use your student benefits, 
whether they were student loans or VA 
benefits or other benefits, at any ac-
credited institution, and the Federal 
Government doesn’t decide what is an 
accredited institution. 
I think the way that we have found 
that balance has been really important 
for higher education. I think it is why 
we have the best higher education in 
the world, but I think the balance is 
one that we ought to be thinking about 
maintaining. 
We should be concerned when we 
begin to get into that balance in a way 
that the government does more than it 
should do or, frankly, less than it 
should do. 
This is the 50th anniversary of the 
Pell Grant Program. I have been a big 
supporter of Pell grants. I know you 
have too. 
And during the time we have worked 
here together, we have expanded Pell 
grants to year-round Pell grants. One 
of the great ways to keep college costs 
down is to finish. If you have got a pat-
tern that is working, particularly if 
you are a first-time college student in 
your family or an adult that has gone 
back to school, if you have got some-
thing that is working and you can keep 
it working, we ought to do that. 
There was about a 10-year period 
where we had two semesters of Pell 
grants and then there was a summer 
without Pell grants, that didn’t really 
work out all that well. And every high-
er education person I know believes we 
did a really great thing by going back 
to year-round Pell. 
We have also increased the Pell grant 
award. In fact, in the last 7 years, we 
have increased the annual individual 
award by over $1,000—$1,120. We have 
reinstated year-round Pell. 
The Pell grant is targeted. It is tar-
geted to people who need help going to 
school. When we were talking, I think 
very wrongly, about free higher edu-
cation—which I think would really be 
expensive if you had free higher edu-
cation and the government became the 
payer. I have said the Pell grant is 
really the way to adjust that. 
If the Pell grant is not high enough, 
Congress can raise it. If the income lev-
els are not high enough, if you had to 
have higher income levels or lower in-
come levels to get the full Pell or par-
tial Pell, Congress can do that as well. 
I think the one thing that would be a 
mistake here would be to ask the tax-
payers of America to now pay the loans 
off of other Americans who made those 
loans. The President is talking about 
the potential, at least the administra-
tion is, of forgiving up to $10,000 in stu-
dent loans for everyone who has a stu-
dent loan and makes less than $150,000. 
You know, a lot of Americans make 
less than $150,000. I think the median 
family income in America today is 
under $70,000, but, suddenly, for those 
who make under $150,000, we would be 
giving them $10,000. And what did they 
get for that $10,000? 
They went to school. They got an 
education. They had choices they made 
as they did that, and we will talk about 
that in a minute. And also the legal 
problems here. You know, the Presi-
dent has said in the past that he didn’t 
think he had the legal authority to for-
give these loans. The Speaker of the 
House has said in the past that she 
didn’t think the President had the 
legal authority to forgive these loans. 
And by the way, there is a way to get 
the legal authority—I will talk about 
that in a minute, too—coming to you 
and I with a proposal to give them the 
authority to do that. 
Even the New York Times Editorial 
Board says that loan forgiveness is— 
this is their quote—‘‘legally dubious, 
economically 
unsound, 
politically 
fraught, and educationally problem-
atic.’’ Those are pretty good reasons 
not to do it. The best one would be the 
‘‘legally dubious’’ one, and the Presi-
dent himself has thought that was the 
case in the past. 
You know, 87 percent of Americans 
don’t have a student loan. The Presi-
dent is telling them, frankly, we are 
going to forgive the loans for the 13 
percent that the other 87 percent don’t 
have. 
People who decided not to go to col-
lege wouldn’t get that $10,000, neither 
would those who avoided loans by at-
tending 
a 
more 
affordable 
school, 
working harder part time, doing the 
things that lots and lots of people have 
done to get through school. 
The same is true of people who have 
gotten out of school, and as they are 
paying off their loans, they have sac-
rificed vacations or better cars or big-
ger houses or other things to pay the 
student loan that they agreed to pay 
back when they took it. 
So the President’s plan dispropor-
tionately would benefit people who are 
in the upper income group, the top 40 
percent of American households hold 60 
percent of the student loans. 
The bottom 40 percent have less than 
20 percent of the student loans. If you 
were going to talk about this at all, 
maybe we should be talking about the 
bottom 40 percent of incomes, not es-
sentially the top 40 percent of incomes, 
which an across-the-board forgiveness 
of debt—and, by the way, that $150,000 
would generally be in that higher per-
cent. 
Student loan forgiveness under the 
President’s plan would largely benefit 
people who, frankly, you could argue, 
just don’t need the benefit as well as 
many other American families and 
American individuals do. 
The Federal Reserve Bank of New 
York estimates that student loan for-
giveness could be as much as $320 or 
$350 billion. That is on top of the $100 
billion that we already have cost the 
system by stepping back, maybe for

too long, but certainly stepping back 
during COVID, and telling people they 
didn’t have to make their loan pay-
ments. 
To put that in some perspective, that 
amount of money, $320 billion and an-
other $100 billion, would fund the en-
tire Pell Grant Program for about a 
decade and a half. 
So we ought to think about what we 
are doing here, how we are doing it. I 
think this plan would actually not 
drive college costs down; it would logi-
cally drive college costs up because 
colleges, just like students, would be 
told, when people make these loans, 
pay the school for the education they 
are getting, there is a good chance they 
won’t have to pay it back, and there is 
a good chance we would have more in-
come during this period of time. 
It is more likely that you would have 
higher college costs and you would 
have people borrowing more money and 
borrowing it quicker than they cur-
rently do because we actually would be 
setting the precedent that there is a 
real chance you won’t have to pay this 
back. 
That is not a good precedent to set. 
What Americans really need right now 
is relief from the crushing inflation we 
see, not more bad policies that put 
more money into the economy and 
drive inflation to an even greater 
height. 
President Biden has been bragging, 
frankly, about how strong our economy 
is and how low unemployment is. Well, 
if that is true, why do we need to spend 
hundreds of billions of dollars on a pro-
gram that is unfair, that disproportion-
ately helps upper income Americans? 
You know, it is either the strongest job 
market since World War II, which the 
President said just recently, or he has 
also said that this economy is the 
strongest economy we have ever had. 
It is either that, or it is an economy 
in such rough shape that people can’t 
pay their loans. Now, it really can’t be 
both. And we are sending all kinds of 
messages here we don’t need to send 
and, frankly, I think the administra-
tion shouldn’t really want to send. 
People made the decision to invest in 
their education. They borrowed money 
to do it. The initial plan was that peo-
ple would borrow money, and as they 
paid it back, that money would be 
available for the next generation of 
people who wanted to borrow money. 
If that had worked out that way, we 
would still be working off some of the 
first dollars that went into these stu-
dent loan payments and student loan 
programs. 
If we say that this select special 
group of people who happen to have the 
exact kind of debt, at this exact mo-
ment, don’t need to pay it back later, 
I think that is the more logical thing 
that would happen. What if we say that 
this group doesn’t have to pay their 
debt so maybe we should figure out 
other groups shouldn’t have to pay 
their debt? 
If it is a good economic policy not to 
pay your student debt, what if we de-
cide we are not going to pay people’s 
car loan debt, or we are not going to 
pay people’s mortgage debt, or we are 
not going to pay people’s credit card 
bills if they are somehow out of con-
trol? 
There are ways to deal with that in 
the legal system, but government for-
giveness is not one of them. The same 
arguments really apply to forgiving 
those debts as would apply to forgiving 
college debts. 
If the President thinks it is a good 
idea, as I mentioned before, he could 
write a piece of legislation, hand it to 
one of his friends in the Congress and 
let us work through the process. Let’s 
make the case as to why these debts 
should be forgiven. 
Let’s debate which other competing 
priority is less important than for-
giving these debts. You know, we have 
spent a lot of time acting like the 
money is not money that you have to 
take from somewhere else to use for a 
current purpose. And I think we are all 
realizing just how untrue that is. 
The President hasn’t sent that legis-
lation up. In fact, the President in his 
budget didn’t even suggest that loan 
forgiveness should be part of his budg-
et. It is not in legislation. It is not in 
the appropriations budget. It is not a 
priority in anything the administra-
tion has put out there for us to debate 
and talk about. 
We just had a hearing this week with 
the Secretary of Education about the 
education budget request. There was 
nothing in that request about specific 
student loan proposals. I really hope 
that the administration will pause, will 
think about this, will understand the 
overall impact of effectively suddenly 
deciding we are going to put $321 bil-
lion or so dollars back into the econ-
omy that otherwise would be coming 
back into the Treasury as the debt re-
payment that those individuals have 
agreed to do. 
We have got ways to help people go 
to school. We have got ways to debate 
whether or not this is a good priority 
to forgive loans, but I take the Presi-
dent’s original position, which is the 
President doesn’t have the authority to 
do that. 
I agree with the Speaker of the 
House’s original position that the 
President doesn’t have the authority to 
do this. If the President wants to make 
the case, let him make it right here, 
and that will be a debate that I think 
would be worth having. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
TRIBUTE TO JOHN LOHRKE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to thank my colleague from Mis-
souri. And I will just mention here in 
the Senate his leadership on so many 
issues are really going to be missed. 
Maybe he will reconsider his decision 
to leave this august body, which is 
going to be a lot less—a lot less of an 
institution that thinks hard about 
these difficult issues when he is gone. 
So I want to thank Senator BLUNT for 
all he has done. He is a great friend of 
mine, so we are going to miss him. 
It is Thursday, and once again it is 
an opportunity for me to talk about 
our Alaskan of the week. 
Now, I know that our pages—the new 
pages, they are going to really realize 
this is probably one of the most excit-
ing, interesting speeches of the week. 
Some of our friends in the media even 
like it because it is end of the week. I 
get to brag about Alaska and talk 
about someone who is doing something 
really great for our State, maybe their 
community, maybe the country, maybe 
the world, right? 
We have all kinds who do this. 
I always like to talk a little bit 
about what is going on in Alaska first. 
So it is amazing how quickly the sea-
sons go by because it is almost summer 
solstice in the State. That is when the 
Sun rarely sets across any part of Alas-
ka and the State is filled with life, 
filled with energy. You can feel it when 
you come up. Hopefully, we get a lot of 
tourists this summer. I know we are 
going to get a lot. A lot of people want 
to get up to Alaska, particularly after 
the pandemic. You can feel it in the air 
when you are there, this sense of en-
ergy and excitement. 
So our tourists are there now. They 
are seeing spectacular scenery, wild-
life, 
glaciers, 
our 
salmon-choked 
streams. They will be able to hike 
through thousands of miles of State 
and Federal parks, climb mountains, 
fly through the skies, and some are 
even there to watch baseball. Yes, 
baseball. 
Now, maybe not the Braves, but still 
good baseball. Now, I know that is 
going to sound odd to some people. 
Now, wait a minute. Going up to Alas-
ka to watch baseball probably isn’t the 
first thing that comes to many people’s 
minds when they think about Alaska. 
But diehard American baseball fans 
know that Alaska has played a funda-
mental role in America’s pastime. 
They know how important Alaska sum-
mers are and have been for decades, 
taking young college students with raw 
but exceptional talent and growing 
them under the midnight Sun into sea-
soned professional Major League Base-
ball players. 
This is the Alaska Baseball League, 
one of the premiere amateur collegiate 
summer baseball leagues that anybody 
plays anywhere in America. 
Let me give you just a few—and I 
mean a few—of those who have come 
up 
through 
the 
Alaska 
Baseball 
League. It has produced some of Major 
League Baseball’s most well known 
All-Stars, including Mark McGwire, 
Barry Bonds, Tom Seaver, Dave Win-
field, and Randy Johnson, just to name 
a few. 
The Alaska Baseball League is some-
times composed of five teams, some-
times six—two teams in Anchorage, 
one in Palmer, one in Chugiak-Eagle 
River, one in Kenai. 
And then there is a team, a very fa-
mous team, in Fairbanks—the oldest

June 16, 2022 
and most storied of them all—which I 
am going to focus on today. 
It is the Fairbanks Goldpanners; and 
the team’s general manager, who is our 
Alaskan of the Week, John Lohrke, 
makes the baseball magic of Alaska 
happen. 
So, first, a few words about John’s 
background. He was raised in a base-
ball family. His father, Jack Lohrke— 
Lucky Lohrke, as baseball fans might 
know him—was a World War II veteran 
who landed on Omaha Beach 6 days 
after D-day, fought his way across Eu-
rope, survived many near-death experi-
ences in combat and even back home; 
hence the name ‘‘Lucky.’’ 
After the military, Jack played base-
ball as a third baseman for the New 
York Giants and the Philadelphia Phil-
lies. 
After Jack Lohrke retired, his family 
moved to California, but, as I said, 
baseball is in the Lohrke family’s 
blood. 
Our Alaskan of the Week, John, had 
an older brother, who was drafted by 
the Red Sox, and John himself got into 
the game administratively. As a col-
lege student at Santa Clara, he began 
helping his college team behind the 
scenes. 
In 1980, the Santa Clara coach was 
going to Alaska to coach the North 
Pole Nicks. John thought that that 
sounded great and asked if he could 
come. He did, he fell in love with Alas-
ka and stayed, like so many in our 
State. 
He managed the Nicks for 7 years, 
then was the president of another 
team, the Oilers, on Alaska’s beautiful 
Kenai Peninsula; then it was back to 
the interior part of the State, where 
John stayed involved with baseball as a 
board member of the Goldpanners. 
In 2016, he became president of the 
board, and now he is the general man-
ager of the Goldpanners in Fairbanks, 
the person in charge of making it all 
happen. And what a responsibility and 
what a team and what a history and 
what a legacy of excellence John has 
been part of. 
Since 
its 
founding 
in 
1960, 
the 
Goldpanners have had over 211 players 
that have gone on to the major 
leagues. 
Isn’t 
that 
remarkable—211 
players? A pipeline into the major 
leagues from Fairbanks, AK. Who 
knew? And that doesn’t include the 
countless others who went on to be 
coaches or general managers or scouts. 
The 
current 
Cleveland 
Guardians 
manager played for the Goldpanners. 
The current pitching coach for the Red 
Sox is also a Goldpanner alumnus. As I 
mentioned, the Goldpanners are one of 
the premier pipelines into the major 
leagues. 
One of the highlights of the season in 
Alaska, something that is happening 
very soon—actually, this Tuesday—is 
when the Goldpanners play their most 
famous game. It is the Midnight Sun 
game, and it is played every summer 
on the summer solstice. 
The tradition of the Midnight Sun 
game in Fairbanks goes way, way back. 
The first one of these games was played 
in 1906. Americans have been playing 
midnight baseball in Alaska well over 
100 years, and now this game is fa-
mous—worldwide. It is a must-do buck-
et list game for baseball enthusiasts all 
across America. Thousands of people, 
many of whom come from across the 
globe, will gather for this game this 
Tuesday, as they do every summer in 
Fairbanks. 
Now, this game is a culmination of a 
dizzying array of activities that occur 
in 
Fairbanks. 
Right 
now, 
parties, 
street festivals, a famed Midnight Sun 
Run. Fairbanks—a great city. My wife 
was born and raised there—is known 
for its spirit, generosity, and on the 
summer solstice weekend, that spirit 
explodes. I will be heading there to-
morrow. I am going to partake in some 
of these festivities, including taking in 
a Goldpanners game and maybe, as I 
usually do, join the many runners in 
the Midnight Sun Run, where I have 
been known to bring up the rear of all 
the runners. We will see what happens. 
But for Tuesday night’s Midnight 
Sun game this year, the Goldpanners 
will be playing the San Diego Waves. 
The game starts at 10 p.m. in Growden 
Park and goes until the wee hours. 
With Fairbanks just 150 miles south 
of the Arctic Circle, the Sun just be-
gins to set in the north a little bit as 
the game gets underway but never 
fully goes down under the horizon, and 
as the game ends, the Sun is actually 
starting to rise again. 
As one sports writer put it: ‘‘It is the 
stuff that baseball dreams are made 
of.’’ 
And it is never dark. And throughout 
its 
century-long 
history, 
artificial 
lights have never been used ever—not 
once. 
John Lohrke, our Alaskan of the 
Week, understands how important that 
particular game is to the larger culture 
of baseball, not just to Fairbanks and 
the interior. He understands how im-
portant the Goldpanners team is for all 
of Alaska, for Fairbanks, but for base-
ball writ large. 
Since starting in as a manager, he 
has put more money into the stadium 
to spruce it up. There are a lot of pic-
tures of some of the great alumni there 
that I mentioned earlier in my re-
marks. He is constantly in touch with 
members of the business community 
who help sponsor and support the team. 
He is in charge of getting housing for 
the 24-member team and the coaches, 
many of whom are talented athletes 
who come up to Alaska from the lower 
48 for the summer. 
He is in charge of transportation 
needs. He is in charge of the vendors 
and ticket sales and the beer garden. 
He is in charge of making all of this 
run smoothly for Fairbanks, for the 
team he loves, and for the love of base-
ball. 
‘‘I love Fairbanks,’’ he said. ‘‘And I 
love baseball. It’s in my blood,’’ and 
this is where it happens. 
So thanks to all the Goldpanner 
players and the community that sup-
ports the team. Thank you, John, for 
all you do to make it happen to bring 
us together to keep baseball alive. Con-
gratulations for being our Alaskan of 
the Week. 
(Mr. WARNOCK assumed the Chair.) 
TRIBUTE TO LIZ BANICKI 
Mr. President, I just talked about our 
Alaskan of the Week. I am going to 
mention another Alaskan who deserves 
really, really great praise. It is with a 
heavy heart that this week Team Sul-
livan will be losing a critical member 
of our staff in the wonderful staffer Liz 
Banicki, who is moving on to the pri-
vate sector to help veterans, a group 
she has worked tirelessly for during 
her time in my office. 
Liz is from Eagle River, AK. She is a 
Chugiak High School graduate. She 
graduated from the University of Port-
land with a degree in political science 
and German studies. She received two 
Fulbrights to study, first in Germany 
and then Austria, but her heart has al-
ways remained in Alaska. 
She interned for the late, great Con-
gressman Don Young before joining my 
campaign in 2014, my first election. She 
did a great job. Then she came to 
Washington with my team, and she is a 
member of what we call in our office 
the OG—been there from the beginning. 
Liz’s story is a story of success, and 
it has been an honor to watch her hard 
work and all she has done for me, my 
team, and most importantly, Alaskans. 
She began with focusing on veterans 
and then expanded her role to take on 
foreign policy and homeland security 
and trade and fisheries. 
In the process, she became one of the 
most impressive staffers in the whole 
U.S. Senate—I am a little biased, but I 
think it is true—on all of these diverse 
issues. It is a marvel listening to her 
explain, for example, fish import trade 
codes—so many of which she knows by 
heart. 
She also understands and has worked 
the power of networking that has 
helped her do her job so well. She 
knows countless people in think tanks, 
the private sector back home, in em-
bassies, and in the White House; and 
that has helped her get the job done for 
Alaska. 
That is Liz’s ethos: Getting the job 
done. 
Now, we all know these jobs take a 
lot of hours. Liz puts in those hours. I 
can’t tell you how many nights I have 
left the office 9:30, 10 p.m., and I will 
walk past Liz’s office—she is still there 
working in front of her computer, on 
the phone, making sure our veterans 
get the help they need; working on 
banning Russian fish from being im-
ported to the U.S.; assisting refugees 
trying to get out of Afghanistan, which 
she worked tirelessly on; working on 
my bill to deter China from invading 
Taiwan—I could go on and on and on. 
Now, we all know, having staff, they 
will push back on occasion when they 
don’t agree with the direction of their 
boss. It is something that can be dif-
ficult but necessary. And I don’t think

that anybody would accuse Liz of being 
shy from pushing back. She knows her 
mind, and she speaks it, and she has 
done an exceptional job in my office; 
and most importantly, she has helped 
thousands and thousands of Alaskans. 
So I just want to thank her for her 
dedication to her State, her country, 
and to our office. We are going to miss 
her very much. 
Good luck, Liz. You will always be a

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of a piece of legisla-
tion with a very long name: the Ser-
geant First Class Heath Robinson Hon-
oring Our Promise to Address Com-
prehensive Toxics Act of 2022, also 
known as the PACT Act—P-A-C-T, 
PACT Act. 
This historic legislation will improve 
and expand access to VA healthcare to 
our Nation’s veterans, including up-
wards of 31⁄2 million post-9/11 veterans. 
It is going to save lives. 
Let me say that again. It is going to 
save lives and, hopefully, a lot of them. 
It is going to better ensure that our 
Nation lives up to the promise from 
President Lincoln’s second inaugural 
address. You recall, he said ‘‘to care for 
those who have borne the battle’’—to 
care for those who have borne the bat-
tle. 
During his first State of the Union 
earlier 
this 
year, 
President 
Biden 
called on Congress to prioritize taking 
care of our veterans who were exposed 
to burn pits and other toxic materials 
while serving overseas in a number of 
theaters, Iraq and Afghanistan among 
them. 
Today, I am proud to say that Con-
gress has answered that call, as well as 
the call of our Nation’s veterans serv-
ice 
organizations, 
affectionately 
known as our VSOs. Those VSOs, vet-
erans’ advocates, and military fami-
lies, many of whom have lost their 
loved ones, have organized and fought 
for this bill for years. 
President Biden likes to say ‘‘all pol-
itics is personal.’’ He also says that all 
diplomacy is personal. I think he is 
right on both accounts. 
This issue is personal for our Presi-
dent, and it is personal for me as well 
as it is for hundreds of thousands of 
other American families. MAJ Beau 
Biden, Delaware’s former attorney gen-
eral, served in the Delaware National 
Guard for more than a decade, includ-
ing a yearlong deployment to Iraq on 
Active Duty. 
I was privileged to have served as the 
commander-in-chief of the Delaware 
National Guard for 8 years during my 
time as Governor, and I have enormous 
respect for the men and women who 
serve today and have served in the 
Delaware National Guard. 
Over the past two decades, I have at-
tended 
countless 
deployment 
cere-
monies in New Castle County, and 
Dover as well, for our soldiers, airmen, 
and their families and also assemblies 
when we welcomed them home, safe 
and sound. 
Like many military parents at these 
sendoffs 
and 
welcome-home 
cere-
monies, the Bidens did not know when 
their son would return. They didn’t 
know for sure if he was going to make 
it back when our Nation sent him off 
to Iraq. I believe it was in late 2008. 
And they did not know, even if their 
son did make it back, whether he 
would carry with him the physical and 
emotional wounds of war that we some-
times can sustain. 
As it turned out, Beau Biden, a young 
man I had known ever since he was a 
little kid, appeared to make it home 
back to Delaware healthy and whole at 
the completion of his tour in 2009. 
I didn’t know it at the time, but Beau 
and his unit spent several months at a 
place called Camp Victory and Joint 
Base Balad in the shadows of toxic 
burn pits that operated for 24 hours a 
day. 
Several years later, in 2015, at the 
age of 46, Beau Biden would pass away 
after battling aggressive brain cancer. 
We couldn’t prove it then, and to be to-
tally honest, we can’t prove it abso-
lutely today; but the sudden onset of 
terminal cancer may well have been 
the result of toxic exposure while he 
was serving overseas. 
This 
story 
is 
all 
too 
common 
amongst veterans of the post-9/11 gen-
eration, including SFC Heath Robin-
son, for whom this bill is named. A 
member of the Ohio Army National 
Guard, Sergeant First Class Robinson 
was deployed to Kosovo, where he expe-
rienced prolonged exposure to burn 
pits. 
Before I go any further, let me just 
take a moment to describe what a burn 
pit is. Burn pits are large areas of 
land—oftentimes bigger than a football 
field—that are used to burn a number 
of things including trash and other 
waste products at military installa-
tions overseas. The waste is oftentimes 
soaked in jet fuel and then set ablaze 
in open-air burn pits, releasing toxins 
into the air in the surrounding area. 
Waste burned in these pits includes 
chemicals, 
includes 
paint, 
includes 
medical and human waste, includes 
metal and aluminum cans, plastic, rub-
ber, ammunition, just to name a few of 
the things. Exposure to the smoke that 
resulted from these burn pits often 
caused servicemembers to experience 
burning of their eyes or throat, as well 
as difficulty in breathing, and rashes, 
too. The toxic smoke could be contami-
nated with lead; it could be contami-
nated with mercury and irritant gases 
that could negatively impact an indi-
vidual’s lungs, liver, and stomach. 
As many as 31⁄2 million servicemem-
bers, including Sergeant First Class 
Robinson, were exposed to toxic burn 
pits while serving in Iraq or Afghani-
stan or some other country. 
After his service, Sergeant First 
Class Robinson was diagnosed with a 
rare autoimmune disorder and stage 
IV—stage 
IV—lung 
cancer. 
His 
oncologist said that the rare stage IV 
cancer that he had been diagnosed with 
could only have been caused by pro-
longed toxic exposure. And yet, for 
years, healthy, young veterans like 
Sergeant First Class Robinson have 
continued to contract rare cancers and 
diseases. They then come home, only 
to fight a new battle: a battle that in-
volves endless paperwork and claims, 
all to prove a service connection that 
almost certainly did exist or does exist. 
Sergeant First Class Robinson died 
last year. He left behind a wife, 
Danielle, and a daughter who at the 
time was 6 years old. Her name is 
Brielle. 
Brielle actually wrote a note to me, 
not in cursive but printed, and it looks 
like it was printed with a crayon. Here 
is what the note essentially says: 
‘‘Vote yes to my Dad’s bill’’—or vote 
yes for my Dad’s bill. 
Well, Brielle, if you are at home and 
watching this today, I want you to 
know that I am going to take your ad-
vice, and I have taken your advice. And 
I hope one day to meet you and your 
mom. And thank you for being in-
volved in a very good cause and for 
sharing your Dad with all of us. 
Please know that your dad’s service 
was a gift to our country and that the 
bill—the piece of legislation that bears 
your father’s name—is going to make a 
positive difference not for a few people, 
not for a few military families, but lit-
erally for millions of military families. 
My own generation of Vietnam vet-
erans had a similar experience to toxic 
exposures as the post 9/11-generation of 
veterans. I have been privileged to 
serve our country in my State in many 
different roles, but there is no greater 
privilege than serving in the U.S. Navy 
and Naval Reserve for a total of 23 
years after the Reserve duty. 
After graduating from Ohio State 
right at the height of the Vietnam war 
in 1968 on a Navy ROTC scholarship, I 
would later serve three tours on Active 
Duty in Southeast Asia during the 
Vietnam war as a Naval flight officer. 
My squadron, a unit of the Seventh 
Fleet, flew a wide variety of missions, 
including low-level surveillance oper-
ations off the coast of Vietnam and 
Cambodia, searching for, among other 
things, infiltrator trawlers disguised as 
fishing boats attempting to resupply 
the Viet Cong in their efforts to over-
throw our ally, the government of 
South Vietnam. 
Following my time on Active Duty, I 
spent another 18 years as a Navy P–3 
Aircraft mission commander in the 
Naval Reserves. Barely a month after 
flying my last P–3 mission in the sum-
mer of 1991 and retiring as a Navy cap-
tain, I led, at the behest of then-Presi-
dent George Herbert Walker Bush, I 
led—I was privileged to lead—a bipar-
tisan, six-Member congressional dele-
gation of Vietnam veterans back to 
Southeast Asia.

Force pilot who was shot down over 
North Vietnam and spent years as a 
POW in the ‘‘Hanoi Hilton.’’ He later 
would become the U.S. Ambassador to 
a united Vietnam. 
The six of us went to Vietnam be-
cause veterans service organizations 
were convinced—because they were 
convinced that hundreds, maybe thou-
sands, of MIAs, missing in action, from 
the Vietnam war were being held in 
captivity in that part of the world. We 
believed that their families deserved to 
know for sure, with certainty, to have 
closure in finding out what happened 
to their loved ones whose bodies were 
never recovered. 
Like many of my colleagues, I come 
from a military family. My family 
knows what it is like to lose a loved 
one to war. My mother’s youngest 
brother, my Uncle Bob, Robert Kidd 
Patton, died in 1944 at the age of 19 
during a kamikaze attack on his air-
craft carrier in the western Pacific. 
My grandmother is a Gold Star 
mother. My Uncle Bob’s body was 
never recovered or returned home to 
the country he served. My family never 
knew what it meant to have, really, a 
sense of closure or finality. They never 
gave up. My grandma never gave up on 
him coming home someday. He never 
did. 
So it means something to families 
like mine for our government to heed 
that moral obligation and stand up for 
military families still waiting to see 
their son or daughter brought home 
and brought home safely. It is that 
moral obligation to our MIAs and their 
families who led us to travel back to 
Vietnam in 1991, when we brought with 
us—and actually presented to the new 
leader of united Vietnam—we brought 
with us a road map from President 
George Herbert Walker Bush to nor-
malize relations with Vietnam. 
Among other things, the road map 
first called on the Vietnamese, who 
were meticulous recordkeepers—metic-
ulous recordkeepers—to provide access 
to Vietnam’s war museum records as 
well as to its archives so that our in-
vestigators might be able to search for 
clues to help resolve the mysteries of 
our MIAs’ disappearance. 
With the strong encouragement of 
our six-Member delegation and the 
tireless efforts of two Members of this 
body, Senator John McCain and Sen-
ator John Kerry, the Vietnamese de-
cided to take this step, and tele-
communications were restored between 
our two countries—and, later, a full 
diplomatic relations. 
That same moral obligation that led 
us to make progress in Vietnam leads 
us here today. Our moral obligation ex-
tends beyond providing closure to fami-
lies of the fallen. It extends to the vet-
erans 
and 
families 
who 
need 
healthcare, who are still dealing with 
the wounds of war—both visible and in-
visible—long after they leave the bat-
tlefield. 
The same year we traveled to Viet-
nam, Congress came together and 
passed the Agent Orange Act to care 
for the hundreds of thousands of Viet-
nam veterans who were exposed to that 
toxic herbicide in Southeast Asia dur-
ing the Vietnam war. 
I believe that many of us would agree 
it took too long—far too long—for that 
bill to be enacted. Finally, after too 
many heart and nervous system com-
plications, deadly cancer diagnoses, 
and even birth defects in the children 
of Vietnam veterans, Congress did the 
right thing. 
The bill before us today also took too 
long to be enacted. Today, Congress 
has once again done the right thing. As 
I mentioned earlier, over the last two 
decades, throughout Iraq and Afghani-
stan, too many of our veterans lived 
and worked alongside these massive 
toxic burn pits that I talked about ear-
lier. 
Hundreds of thousands of square feet 
of open-air disposal sites where plastics 
and jet fuel, chemicals and human 
waste, were burned daily producing 
toxic black plumes and bringing harm-
ful 
chemicals 
into 
the 
lungs 
of 
unsuspecting 
servicemembers. 
The 
time has come to take care of these 
veterans—those who have borne the 
battle. 
This legislation, the PACT Act, will 
enhance and expand VA healthcare and 
benefits for toxic-exposed veterans. 
Specifically, this bill will provide VA 
healthcare to the estimated 31⁄2 million 
post-9/11 veterans who have experi-
enced toxic exposures. 
This bill establishes a presumption of 
service connection for 23 conditions 
that are related to toxic exposures and 
improves the process by which the VA 
may add presumptions in the future. 
Additionally, the bill will expand VA 
research on toxic exposure. It will pro-
vide toxic exposure screenings at ap-
pointments, and it will provide addi-
tional training to VA healthcare work-
ers and benefits personnel. 
I have spent a considerable amount 
of time discussing the importance of 
this bill. Others have been here today 
before me and earlier this week. I am 
proud to have supported it. I know my 
colleagues feel the same way. Having 
said that, I also believe that we may 
have missed an opportunity to consider 
some amendments that would have im-
proved the bill and, importantly, would 
have paid for its considerable pricetag. 
In addition to being a recovering 
Governor—my 
colleagues 
have 
dif-
ferent names to describe me; a lot of 
them call me a recovering Governor, 
and I am a recovering Governor—I am 
also a recovering State treasurer of 
Florida. I have long believed that, if 
something is worth doing, then it is 
worth paying for. I will say that again. 
If things are worth doing, they are 
worth paying for. I understand that 
taking care of our veterans is a cost of 
war, but these costs should be paid for. 
That is why I filed an amendment to 
have the Department of Defense iden-
tify savings to pay for the cost of this 
bill. 
I also filed amendments that address 
Albert Einstein’s definition of ‘‘insan-
ity.’’ Einstein is famous for saying 
many things, but one of those is with 
regard to insanity. He describes insan-
ity as ‘‘doing the same thing over and 
over again and expecting a different re-
sult.’’ 
What does that mean? 
In this instance, it means that, if 
servicemembers are repeatedly being 
exposed to toxic chemicals across new 
generations, we have to do something 
on the front end to reduce toxic expo-
sures instead of always playing catch-
up decades later as we are doing now. 
That is why we should be giving the 
Department of Defense the tools it 
needs to track toxic exposures more 
closely. Our servicemembers deserve 
the ability to report toxic exposures in 
realtime and to be protected from 
them. I believe these commonsense 
ideas may actually provide long-term 
savings for the taxpayer and will lead 
to healthier outcomes for our veterans. 
Finally, while we are not offsetting 
the cost of this legislation today, it 
does not mean that we shouldn’t pro-
vide vigorous oversight of this new 
funding. That is why I filed another 
amendment to enhance the require-
ment that the Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs provide annual spending plans 
to Congress as well as to require both 
the VA inspector general and the Gov-
ernment Accountability Office to re-
port to Congress on implementation— 
an important step. 
My hope is that one or maybe all of 
these ideas could be included in future 
legislation later this year, and I look 
forward to working with our colleagues 
on improving this important bill as we 
move forward. 
In having said that, let me close by 
just reiterating what I said at the be-
ginning. This is a historic bill for our 
Nation’s veterans. It does right by an 
entire generation of veterans who have 
defended our Nation over the past two 
decades. It is going to bring millions of 
new veterans into the VA for their 
healthcare, including mental health 
care. These new benefits, which our 
veterans earned through their service 
to our Nation, are going to make a real 
difference for our veterans and their 
families. 
As the last serving Vietnam veteran 
now serving in the U.S. Senate, I am 
proud to have supported this bill. 
I want to thank and commend our 
colleagues who lead the Senate’s Vet-
erans’ 
Affairs 
Committee—Senator 
TESTER and Senator MORAN—and their 
staffs and others for working together 
to shepherd this bipartisan bill through 
the legislative process. 
I want to thank our veterans service 
organizations—those VSOs I mentioned 
earlier—and the countless advocates 
who helped to make this legislation 
possible. 
I want to thank the young lady who 
wrote this note. She was kind enough 
to send it to me and to encourage me 
to support this legislation named after 
her father.

DICK DURBIN 
f 
JUNETEENTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this 
Sunday, we commemorate the 157th 
Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and 
the nineteenth, which celebrates the 
liberation 
of 
the 
last 
remaining 
enslaved Black Americans at the end of 
the Civil War. This is our newest Fed-
eral holiday, which we will observe on 
Monday, but African-American com-
munities have celebrated Juneteenth 
as Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, or 
Black Independence Day as far back as 
1886 in Texas. 
On this date in 1865, U.S. Army Major 
General Gordon Granger arrived at a 
Confederate outpost in Galveston, TX, 
where he delivered the news of Abra-
ham Lincoln’s Emancipation Procla-
mation to 250,000 still-enslaved Texans. 
Many United States Colored Troops— 
USCT—who fought for freedom and to 
preserve 
the 
Union, 
accompanied 
Granger. Lincoln had issued the Eman-
cipation Proclamation, which granted 
Black Americans their freedom, 2 years 
earlier. Robert E. Lee had surrendered 
to U.S. Army Lt. General Ulysses 
Grant 2 months earlier at Appomattox. 
In my home State of Maryland, aboli-
tionists Frederick Douglass and Har-
riet Tubman paved the way for future 
civil rights activists by risking their 
lives to help bring enslaved people to 
freedom. Their work has had a pro-
found impact on our community and on 
Maryland’s rich cultural history. 
African-American history is Amer-
ican history. We all must learn the les-
sons of Juneteenth and understand how 
our lives have been changed because of 
it. We cannot celebrate the freedoms 
brought forth on Juneteenth without 
acknowledging there was slavery in the 
United States of America. Slavery is a 
part of American history. The Con-
stitution originally protected slavery 
through the fugitive slave clause and 
three-fifths clause. 
We cannot and should not hide from 
these facts or try to erase them from 
our history books or suppress them in 
our classrooms. 
In Maryland, we often look to the 
work of Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
who spent his life fighting for the 
rights of Black Americans and trying 
to reverse systemic discrimination. 
Marshall, arguing before the Supreme 
Court in Brown v. Board of Education 
and later serving as the first African- 
American Associate Justice on the 
Court, set a precedent for future gen-
erations of Black men and women that 
even the highest honors are within 
their reach. The Senate recently con-
firmed Ketanji Brown Jackson to be 
the first Black woman on the Supreme 
Court. 
While Thurgood Marshall was an in-
spiration, his work of reversing sys-
temic racism is far from complete. It is 
our responsibility as a Nation to con-
tinue the work Justice Marshall and 
activists like him started. Though we 
have made progress, the fight for racial 
justice will never be complete until we 
have achieved equitable treatment for 
people of all races and can truly guar-
antee equality of opportunity. The pur-
suit of racial justice will ensure that 
we live up to our Nation’s promise of 
equality for all people, regardless of 
the color of their skin. 
Countering systemic racism and ad-
vancing racial justice should be a daily 
occurrence. We must learn from our 
past, actively challenge our own preju-
dices, and take conscious steps to dis-
mantle the racist structures embedded 
in our society. 
On President Biden’s first day in of-
fice, he signed an Executive order enti-
tled ‘‘Advancing Racial Equity and 
Support from Underserved Commu-
nities Through the Federal Govern-
ment.’’ The President directed Federal 
Agencies to assess how their programs 
and policies might be perpetuating sys-
temic barriers to opportunity and to 
propose Equity Action Plans that con-
tain specific Agency commitments to 
redress inequities and promote equi-
table outcomes in communities. 
The Biden-Harris administration has 
already taken numerous steps to ex-
pand opportunities for African-Ameri-
cans. The Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law permanently reauthorizes the Mi-
nority Business Development Agency 
for the first time and enhances its au-
thority. 
The 
administration 
has 
stepped up its efforts to combat racial 
discrimination in the housing market 
and to help African-Americans get fair 
treatment when it comes to staying in 
their homes and on their farms and re-
ceiving disaster assistance after trag-
edy strikes. 
In particular, as the pandemic exac-
erbated preexisting racial disparities, 
the administration took strong steps 
to improve outcomes for African-Amer-
icans 
with 
respect 
to 
education, 
healthcare, and transportation. 
As we commemorate this historic 
holiday, I encourage all Americans to 
reflect on the many lessons of the 
story of Juneteenth and commit our-
selves to the pursuit of racial justice 
and reconciliation. If we do that, indi-
vidually and collectively, Juneteenth 
truly will become a Jubilee.

came to Manhattan, KS, on a football 
scholarship in 1950 and would go on to 
be one of the most well-rounded play-
ers in the history of the program. An 
All-American from 1951 to 1953, Veryl 
led the team in practically every sta-
tistical category on offense and, to this 
day, still ranks in the top 10 for many 
punt-return categories. Veryl’s athletic 
achievements were not limited to the 
football field, as he was the Big Seven 
Indoor Long Jump champion in 1952. 
Following an illustrious career for the 
Wildcats, Veryl would be selected by 
the Green Bay Packers with the fourth 
overall pick in the 1954 NFL Draft. 
Veryl led the NFL in punt return av-
erage during his rookie season, but 
would step away from the Green Bay 
Packers after just 24 games to serve in 
the U.S. Air Force. After his time in 
the military, Veryl played two more 
seasons of professional football in Can-
ada. He would then go on to work for 
the Chicago Board of Education for 10 
years before making his way back to 
Kansas State University. Once back at 
K-State, Veryl developed the first uni-
versity 
wide 
student-minority 
pro-
gram, where many campus groups such 
as the Black Student Union, Ebony 
Theater, and United Black Voices still 
exist due to his efforts. A member of 
both the K-State athletics hall of fame 
and the football team’s ring of honor, 
Veryl’s legacy will continue to live on 
through the hearts and minds of his 
family, friends, and K-State fans across 
the country. 
I now ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the wonderful life and 
career of Mr. Veryl Switzer. A true in-
spiration to the State of Kansas, fight-
ing ever fighting for a Wildcat vic-
tory.∑

RECOGNIZING BEANS CAFE AND 
BAKERY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Beans Cafe and Bakery of Dry 
Ridge, KY, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
The road to entrepreneurial success 
is rarely a straight and narrow path, as 
Richard Hayhoe and his wife could tell 
you. The couple moved to northern 
Kentucky from Canada in 2010, intent 
on flipping houses for a living. How-
ever, their dream of entering the hous-
ing market did not turn out as imag-
ined and in 2011, opportunity presented 
itself. As Richard looked around his 
adopted hometown, he saw a struggling 
doughnut shop with a big ‘‘For Sale’’ 
sign posted, and decided to act. Thus, 
Richard Hayhoe’s Beans Cafe and Bak-
ery was born. 
Opened in late 2011, Beans Cafe and 
Bakery offers some of the finest con-
fections available in Kentucky. Be-
tween fresh donuts, muffins, and a va-
riety of other pastries, customers are 
not left wanting, as his store provides 
just about any morning pick-me-up one 
could hope for. In addition to keeping 
their ovens busy, Beans Cafe of course 
keeps their coffee pots full so that 
their regular customers can enjoy a 
fresh cup on their morning commute. 
Despite their name, Beans Cafe and 
Bakery is not just a popular breakfast 
site; it is a one-stop shop for any meal: 
breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. 
Beans Cafe boasts a delicious menu of 
sandwiches on their signature bread, 
wraps, soups, and salads. Beans Cafe 
and Bakery also has plenty of options 
for dessert, including ice cream and 
hand-spun milkshakes perfect for a 
warm summer evening spent with fam-
ily and friends. 
Soon after Beans Cafe and Bakery 
opened their doors, residents of Dry 
Ridge came in droves. Oftentimes, 
Richard found their reputation pre-
ceded them, as local hotel and bed-and- 
breakfast owners insisted their trav-
elers make time for Beans Cafe. When 
the Ark Encounter exhibit opened 
nearby in 2016, that new flood of visi-
tors helped to propel an already grow-
ing business into a new phase of expan-
sion, moving to a different location 
right off the highway. Beans Cafe and 
Bakery has only continued to grow 
since then, even opening up a separate 
kitchen space in order to meet the 
ever-growing demand for their deli-
cious baked goods. 
In addition to their excellence in the 
kitchen, Richard Hayhoe has made 
Beans Cafe and Bakery a place for com-
munity involvement, hosting a month-
ly get-together for Christians wanting 
to engage in the realm of public policy 
and local government. Beans Cafe and 
Bakery also offers classes for junior 
bakers, providing a fun and educational 
atmosphere for young children to learn 
about the baking craft. 
When Richard Hayhoe came to Ken-
tucky, he ventured south from his na-
tive land to pursue a career that he 
soon realized was not all that it was 
chalked up to be. Instead of giving up 
on Dry Ridge or Kentucky entirely, he 
stayed and made his home by opening a 
business that caters to its residents. 
Richard Hayhoe is the embodiment of 
the type of perseverance inherent to 
small business owners. That is why 
Beans Cafe and Bakery has seen such 
success; it is led by a dedicated and 
hard-working team who know how to 
treat their customers right. Congratu-
lations to Richard and the entire team 
at Beans Cafe and Bakery. I look for-
ward to seeing their continued growth 
and success in Kentucky.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. CANTWELL): 
S. 4420. A bill to provide for advance-
ments in carbon removal research, 
quantification, and commercialization, 
including by harnessing natural proc-
esses, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Carbon Removal 
and Emissions Storage Technologies 
Act, the CREST Act. I am pleased to be 
partnering with Senator CANTWELL on 
this bill. Our bipartisan bill would di-
rect the Department of Energy to re-
search and evaluate the feasibility of 
innovative carbon removal and storage 
pathways. The name the CREST Act 
alludes to the fact that we have 
reached the ‘‘crest’’ of our emissions 
and we must work to bring them down. 
With more and more private and pub-
lic sector commitments to reach net- 
zero emissions within certain time-
frames, companies are scrambling to 
invest in quantifiable, durable, and 
verifiable carbon removal solutions. 
Microsoft, for example, has made a 
commitment to be carbon negative by 
2030. Even though Microsoft plans to 
reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 
more than half, it will need to remove 
the rest of its carbon emissions. In 
order to do this, Microsoft plans to in-
vest $1 billion in carbon removal tech-
nologies, such as direct air capture, 
forestation, and carbon mineralization. 
Despite the growing number of com-
panies that are looking to offset their 
emissions, current cost estimates show 
that private sector investment alone 
will not be sufficient to research and 
deploy carbon removal pathways. I 
strongly supported the Energy Act of 
2020, which authorized the first com-
prehensive Federal carbon removal re-
search and development program, and 
the bipartisan infrastructure, which in-
vested $3.6 billion in direct air capture. 
Although these investments have been 
significant, more work is needed in fur-
ther research, increased testing, and 
enhanced public-private partnerships 
to help aid in scaling carbon removal 
technologies. 
The CREST Act would expand the 
Department of Energy’s carbon re-
moval research and development pro-
grams to include carbon removal path-
ways that can permanently sequester 
carbon dioxide or use carbon dioxide to 
produce biofuels or products. The key 
areas of focus for research and develop-
ment in our legislation are biomass 
carbon removal and storage, geological 
removal, atmospheric and aquatic re-
moval, carbon dioxide storage, and car-
bon dioxide removal quantification.

S3005 
June 16, 2022 
Our legislation also aims to accel-
erate the commercialization of innova-
tive carbon solutions through a pilot 
program at the Department of Energy. 
This pilot program would be charged 
with accelerating the deployment of af-
fordable and proven carbon removal 
technologies. 
This 
reverse-auction 
style pilot program would position the 
government to purchase innovative and 
promising technologies, subject to cer-
tain criteria, and reduce the costs of 
those technologies. This would allow 
companies that may not have as much 
purchasing power as Microsoft to par-
ticipate in carbon removal to help off-
set emissions. 
This pilot program would also sup-
port companies that are leading the 
way in carbon removal technology, like 
Running Tide in Maine, in bringing 
down the cost of its product. Running 
Tide captures carbon dioxide using 
kelp microforests, sun, ocean currents, 
and gravity. This new and exciting 
company grows floating kelp micro-
forest attached to biodegradable buoys 
that sink as they break down. The car-
bon captured through the floating 
microforest is effectively removed for 
hundreds of years once it hits the 
ocean floor. Running Tide hopes to 
soon be selling ‘‘kelp carbon credits’’ 
to help offset private entities’ emis-
sions. They are currently working to 
commercialize quickly. These innova-
tive solutions are the kinds that our 
new pilot program would seek to en-
courage. 
Mr. President, climate change is a 
significant 
environmental 
challenge 
that requires innovative and global so-
lutions to reduce greenhouse gas pollu-
tion. While carbon removal and storage 
is only a small part of the solution, it 
is critical that we expand our country’s 
work in this area. Our bipartisan bill 
has earned endorsements from Bipar-
tisan Policy Center Action, ClearPath 
Action, Citizens for Responsible En-
ergy Solutions, and many others. I 
urge my colleagues to join Senator 
CANTWELL and me in supporting this 
legislation. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4424. A bill to amend the Recre-
ation and Public Purposes Act to au-
thorize sales and leases of certain Fed-
eral land to federally recognized Indian 
Tribes, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the bipartisan Recreation 
and Public Purposes Tribal Parity Act 
to correct a long-standing and unjust 
oversight that prevents Tribal govern-
ments from having the same opportuni-
ties as State and local governments do 
to buy and lease public lands for rec-
reational purposes. 
Current law allows the Bureau of 
Land Management to lease or sell cer-
tain public lands to State and local 
governments or qualifying nonprofits if 
those lands will be used for explicit 
public and recreational purposes. These 
lands are used for a variety of public 
and recreational purposes, like historic 
monument sites, schools, firehouses, 
law 
enforcement 
facilities, 
court-
houses, health facilities, hospitals, and 
parks. However, the law does not allow 
the BLM to sell or lease these lands to 
Tribal governments. 
Our bill would allow Tribal govern-
ments to participate in the program in 
the same way that State and local gov-
ernments do. Doing so would help en-
sure Tribal nations enjoy the same op-
portunities for land acquisition as 
State and local governments and non-
profit organizations do. 
Tribal governments were not consid-
ered when the Recreation and Public 
Purposes Act became law in 1926. The 
omission leaves Tribes without the 
same opportunities as other govern-
ments to use public lands for these ben-
eficial purposes. This disadvantage is 
clear, as the sale and lease of public 
lands is often at a discount compared 
to fair market value. This issue is part 
of the greater need to correct long-
standing barriers that undermine the 
sovereignty of Tribal governments and 
our efforts to right historic wrongs. 
The Federal Government owns about 
640 million acres of land, about 28% of 
the total land in the United States. 
Public lands potentially available for 
disposal by the Bureau of Land Man-
agement alone are located across at 
least 18 States. The exclusion of Indian 
Tribes from qualifying for acquisition 
of these lands is not based on any clear 
policy rationale. 
As our Nation works to strengthen 
Tribal sovereignty and self-determina-
tion, it is important that we ensure our 
laws treat Tribal governments in equal 
regard as State and local governments 
and ensure they have the opportunity 
for positive and productive land use ac-
tivity. 
I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for intro-
ducing this legislation with me in the 
Senate, and Congressman LAMALFA for 
championing this effort in the House of 
Representatives. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to enact 
this commonsense bill as quickly as 
possible. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
TILLIS, and Mr. GRASSLEY): 
S. 4430. A bill to amend title 35, 
United States Code, to establish an 
interagency task force between the 
United States Patent and Trademark 
Office and the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration for purposes of sharing infor-
mation and providing technical assist-
ance with respect to patents, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4430 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Interagency 
Patent Coordination and Improvement Act

mittee on the Judiciary of the Senate and 
the Committee on the Judiciary of the House 
of Representatives a report that contains— 
(1) a description of the frequency with 
which— 
(A) information is provided by the Food 
and Drug Administration to the United 
States Patent and Trademark Office through 
the Interagency Task Force on Patents es-
tablished under section 15 of title 35, United 
States Code, as added by section 4(a) of this 
Act, or under processes established by that 
Task Force; and 
(B) the information described in subpara-
graph (A) is used in patent examinations; 
(2) an identification of which methods of 
providing information, as described in para-
graph (1)(A), and types of information so 
shared, are most useful to patent examiners; 
(3) any recommendations for changes to be 
made by Congress to the mandate, funding, 
or operations of the Task Force described in 
paragraph (1)(A); and 
(4) an identification of other Federal agen-

merce for Intellectual Property and Director 
of the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office should explore opportunities for co-
ordination that are similar to those under-
taken with the Food and Drug Administra-
tion through the activities of the Task Force 
described in paragraph (1)(A). 
SEC. 4. INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE ON PATENTS. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Chapter 1 of title 35, 
United States Code, is amended— 
(1) in section 2(c), by adding at the end the

NATING 
JUNE 
15, 
2022, 
AS 
‘‘WORLD ELDER ABUSE AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ AND THE MONTH OF 
JUNE AS ‘‘ELDER ABUSE AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 682 
Whereas, in 2021, approximately 53,000,000 
residents of the United States, or about 1 in 
every 7 individuals, have attained the age of 
65, and by 2060, 95,000,000 individuals in the 
United States will be over the age of 65 ac-
cording to estimates by the Bureau of the 
Census; 
Whereas elder abuse remains a challenging 
problem and can come in many different 
forms, often manifesting as physical, sexual, 
or psychological abuse, financial exploi-
tation, neglect, and social media abuse; 
Whereas elder abuse, neglect, and exploi-
tation have no boundaries and cross all ra-
cial, social, class, gender, and geographic 
lines, according to the Elder Justice Coali-
tion; 
Whereas more than 1 in 10 individuals in 
the United States over the age of 60 have 
been subjected to abuse each year, with 
many such victims enduring abuse in mul-
tiple forms, according to the American Jour-
nal of Public Health; 
Whereas most reported cases of abuse, ne-
glect, and exploitation of older adults take 
place within private homes, and approxi-
mately 90 percent of the perpetrators in 
elder financial exploitation cases are family 
members or other trusted individuals, ac-
cording to the National Adult Protective 
Services Association; 
Whereas research suggests that elderly in-
dividuals in the United States who experi-
ence cognitive impairment, physical disabil-
ities, or isolation are more likely to become 
the victims of abuse than those who do not 
experience cognitive impairment, physical 
disabilities, or isolation; 
Whereas other risk factors for elder abuse 
can include low social support, poor physical 
health, and experience of previous traumatic 
events, according to the National Center on 
Elder Abuse; 
Whereas close to half of elderly individuals 
who suffer from dementia will experience 
abuse during their lifetime, according to the 
Department of Justice; 
Whereas only 1 in 24 cases of elder abuse is 
reported according the New York State Of-
fice of Children and Family Services; 
Whereas the Population Reference Bureau 
estimates that 1,900,000 elders will live in 
nursing homes by 2030; 
Whereas, in a 2012 study conducted by 
Michigan State University, approximately 24 
percent of the nursing home residents who 
participated in the study reported at least 
one incident of physical abuse by nursing 
home staff; 
Whereas, on World Elder Abuse Awareness 
Day, the United States mourned the loss of 
elderly individuals who perished in nursing 
homes and other long-term care facilities 
during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has led to 
the emergence of new scams against older 
adults, including those related to vaccines; 
Whereas there has been an increase in hate 
crimes 
committed 
against 
older, 
Asian 
Americans during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas, within the last 2 years, Congress 
passed and the President signed 2 measures 
that make nearly $400,000,000 available for 
implementation of Elder Justice Act (42 
U.S.C. 1395i–3a et seq.) initiatives, the larg-
est funding stream related to such initia-
tives in the history of the Act; and 
Whereas Congress, in passing the Elder 
Justice Act of 2009 (42 U.S.C. 1395i–3a et seq.), 
the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 
3001 et seq.), the Elder Abuse Prevention and 
Prosecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21701 et seq.), the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (Public 
Law 117–2), and the Consolidated Appropria-
tions Act, 2021 (Public Law 116–260), recog-
nized the importance of protecting older peo-
ple of the United States against abuse and 
exploitation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates June 15, 2022, as ‘‘World 
Elder Abuse Awareness Day’’ and the month 
of June as ‘‘Elder Abuse Awareness Month’’; 
(2) recognizes— 
(A) judges, lawyers, adult protective serv-
ices professionals, law enforcement officers, 
social workers, health care providers, advo-
cates for victims, and other professionals 
and agencies for their efforts to advance 
awareness of elder abuse; 
(B) the important work of the Elder Jus-
tice Coordinating Council, which has contin-
ued through the previous 2 Administrations 
and involves 15 different Federal agencies; 
(C) the essential work done by adult pro-
tective services personnel, who regularly 
came to the assistance of victims, inves-
tigated reports of abuse, and actively pre-
vented future victimization of older people 
in the United States, especially during the 
ongoing COVID–19 pandemic as the social 
isolation of elderly individuals due to stay-

RESOLUTION 
683—SUP-
PORTING 
THE 
GOALS 
AND 
IDEALS OF WORLD SICKLE CELL 
AWARENESS DAY 
Mr. 
BOOKER 
(for 
himself, 
Mr. 
BROWN, and Mr. VAN
HOLLEN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 683 
Whereas sickle cell disease (referred to in 
this preamble a ‘‘SCD’’) is a genetically in-
herited condition present at birth that in-
volves a group of red blood cell disorders and 
is a major health problem in the United 
States and worldwide; 
Whereas the 2022 theme of World Sickle 
Cell Awareness Day, ‘‘Shine the Light on 
Sickle Cell’’, is an immediate call to action 
to improve the health and quality of life for 
individuals living with SCD and their fami-
lies; 
Whereas, in 1972, Dr. Charles Whitten es-
tablished the Sickle Cell Disease Association 
of America, which is now headquartered in 
Hanover, Maryland, to improve research, 
education, and healthcare for SCD patients; 
Whereas, in 1972, Congress passed the Na-
tional Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act (Pub-
lic Law 92–294; 86 Stat. 136), which provided 
authority to establish education, informa-
tion, 
screening, 
testing, 
counseling, 
re-
search, and treatment programs for SCD pa-
tients; 
Whereas SCD is a genetic mutation that 
causes a single misspelling in the DNA in-
structions for hemoglobin, a protein that 
aids in carrying oxygen in the blood, which 
may result in chronic complications related 
to anemia, stroke, infections, organ failure, 
tissue damage, intense periods of pain re-
ferred to as vaso-occlusive crisis, and pre-
mature death; 
Whereas sickle cell trait (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘SCT’’) occurs when an in-
dividual inherits one copy of the sickle cell 
gene from one parent, and when both parents 
have SCT, there is a 25 percent chance that 
any of their children will have SCD; 
Whereas there are an estimated 3,000,000 
individuals with SCT in the United States, 
with many unaware of their status; 
Whereas an estimated 100,000 individuals 
have SCD in the United States, with 1 out of 
365 African-American births and 1 out of 
16,300 Hispanic-American births resulting in 
SCD, and nearly 1 out of 13 African-Amer-
ican babies are born with SCT; 
Whereas SCD affects millions of people 
throughout the world, especially individuals 
of genetic descent from sub-Saharan regions 
of Africa, South America, the Caribbean, 
Central America, Saudi Arabia, India, Tur-
key, Greece, and Italy; 
Whereas the prevalence of SCT varies 
greatly by region, with rates as high as 40 
percent in certain regions of sub-Saharan Af-
rica, eastern Saudi Arabia, and central India; 
Whereas, in many countries that are poor 
in resources, more than 90 percent of chil-
dren with SCD do not live to see adulthood; 
Whereas approximately 1,000 children in 
Africa are born with SCD each day, more 
than half of whom will die before their fifth 
birthday; 
Whereas the high prevalence of SCD in the 
central and western regions of India results 
in approximately 20 percent of babies diag-
nosed with SCD dying before the age of 2; 
Whereas, in 2006, the World Health Assem-
bly passed a resolution, adopted by the 
United Nations in 2009, recognizing SCD as a 
public health priority with a call to action 
that each country implement measures to 
tackle the disease; 
Whereas screening newborns for SCD is a 
crucial first step for families to obtain a 
timely diagnosis and comprehensive care and 
to decrease the mortality rate of children 
with SCD; 
Whereas approved treatments for SCD are 
limited, with the Food and Drug Administra-
tion approving only 4 SCD therapies since 
2017, but there are more than 40 SCD thera-
pies in development; 
Whereas there is an immediate need for 
lifesaving therapeutics that can improve the 
duration and quality of life of individuals 
with SCD; 
Whereas, in 2020, the National Academies 
of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine de-
veloped a comprehensive strategic plan and 
blueprint for action to address SCD, which 
highlights the need to develop new innova-
tive therapies and to address barriers to the 
equitable access of approved treatments; 
Whereas, in 2020, the Department of Health 
and Human Services, in partnership with the 
American Society of Hematology and the 
Sickle in Africa Consortium and in collabo-
ration with the World Health Organization, 
hosted a webinar for a joint effort to 
strengthen efforts to combat SCD during the 
coronavirus disease (commonly known as 
‘‘COVID–19’’) pandemic and beyond; 
Whereas the late Kwaku Ohene-Frempong, 
M.D., Professor Emeritus of Pediatrics at the 
Perelman School of Medicine at the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, an American Society of 
Hematology member who served on the Glob-
al Coalition on SCD, has been a leader in ad-
vancing the body of knowledge in SCD re-
search, public health, and medicine, and is 
recognized 
as 
immeasurably 
benefitting 
thousands of children worldwide; 
Whereas there are emerging genetic ther-
apy technologies, including gene editing, 
that 
can 
modify 
a 
patient’s 
own 
hematopoietic stem cells to enable them to 
generate healthy red blood cells to prevent 
sickle cell crises; 
Whereas while hematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation 
(commonly 
known 
as 
‘‘HSCT’’) is currently the only cure for SCD, 
and while advancements in treatment for 
complications associated with SCD have 
been made, more research is needed to find 
widely available and accessible treatments 
and cures to help individuals with SCD; and 
Whereas, although June 19, 2022, has been 
designated as ‘‘World Sickle Cell Awareness 
Day’’ to increase public alertness across the 
United States and global community about 
SCD, there remains a continued need for em-
pirical research, early detection screenings 
for SCD trait carriers, novel effective treat-
ments leading to a cure, and preventative 
care programs with respect to complications 
from sickle cell anemia and conditions re-
lated to SCD: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of World 
Sickle Cell Awareness Day; 
(2) commits to ensuring equitable access to 
new sickle cell disease (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘SCD’’) treatments by shining 
the light among all economic, racial, and 
ethnic groups to improve health outcomes 
for those living with SCD; 
(3) calls on the Department of Health and 
Human Services to create global policy solu-
tions aimed at providing support for the 
global community and the domestic re-
sources needed to provide access to newborn 
screening programs, therapeutic interven-
tions, and support services in partnership

States and the world to hold appropriate pro-
grams, events, and activities on Sickle Cell 
Awareness Day to raise public awareness of 
SCD traits, preventative care programs, 
treatments, and other patient services for 
those suffering from SCD, complications 
from SCD, and conditions related to SCD; 
and 
(6) urges that the options to be considered 
to combat SCD not only address access to 
potential future curative treatments, but 
also address the bias that the population

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3008 
June 16, 2022 
SEC. 2. SELECTUSA DEFINED. 
In this Act, the term ‘‘SelectUSA’’ means 
the SelectUSA program of the Department of 
Commerce established by Executive Order 
13577 (76 Fed. Reg. 35,715). 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Semiconductors underpin the United 
States and global economies, including man-
ufacturing sectors. Semiconductors are also 
essential to the national security of the 
United States. 
(2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought 
about by the COVID–19 pandemic and other 
complex factors impacting the overall supply 
chain, has threatened the economic recovery 
of the United States and industries that em-
ploy millions of United States citizens. 
(3) Addressing current challenges and 
building resilience against future risks re-
quires ensuring a secure and stable supply 
chain for semiconductors that will support 
the economic and national security needs of 
the United States and its allies. 
(4) The supply chain for semiconductors is 
complex and global. While the United States 
plays a leading role in certain segments of 
the semiconductor industry, securing the 
supply chain requires onshoring, reshoring, 
or diversifying vulnerable segments, such as 
for— 
(A) fabrication; 
(B) advanced packaging; and 
(C) materials and equipment used to manu-
facture semiconductor products. 
(5) The Federal Government can leverage 
foreign direct investment and private dollars 
to grow the domestic manufacturing and 
production capacity of the United States for 
vulnerable segments of the semiconductor 
supply chain. 
(6) The SelectUSA program of the Depart-
ment of Commerce, in coordination with 
other Federal agencies and State-level eco-
nomic development organizations, is posi-
tioned to boost foreign direct investment in 
domestic manufacturing and to help secure 
the semiconductor supply chain of the 
United States. 
SEC. 4. COORDINATION WITH STATE-LEVEL ECO-
NOMIC DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZA-
TIONS. 
Not later than 180 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Executive Di-
rector of SelectUSA shall solicit comments 
from State-level economic development or-
ganizations— 
(1) to review— 
(A) what efforts the Federal Government 
can take to support increased foreign direct 
investment in any segment of semicon-
ductor-related production; 
(B) what barriers to such investment may 
exist and how to amplify State efforts to at-
tract such investment; 
(C) public opportunities those organiza-
tions have identified to attract foreign di-
rect investment to help increase investment 
described in subparagraph (A); 
(D) resource gaps or other challenges that 
prevent those organizations from increasing 
such investment; and 
(2) to develop recommendations for— 
(A) how SelectUSA can increase such in-
vestment independently or through partner-
ship with those organizations; and 
(B) working with countries that are allies 
or partners of the United States to ensure 
that foreign adversaries (as defined in sec-
tion 8(c)(2) of the Secure and Trusted Com-
munications Networks Act of 2019 (47 U.S.C. 
1607(c)(2))) do not benefit from United States 
efforts to increase such investment.

RECT 
INVESTMENT

SEMICON-
DUCTOR-RELATED MANUFACTURING 
AND PRODUCTION. 
Not later than 2 years after the date of the

United States supply chain for semiconduc-
tors, including by— 
(A) working with other relevant Federal 
agencies; and 
(B) working with State-level economic de-
velopment organizations and implementing 
any 
strategies 
or 
recommendations 
SelectUSA received from those organiza-
tions. 
SEC. 6. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS. 
No additional funds are authorized to be 
appropriated for the purpose of carrying out 
this 
Act.

HONORING OUR PACT ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleague from Delaware 
via Columbus, OH, for his comments, 
and I want to talk for a moment about 
what we did today in the U.S. Senate. 
We passed legislation very important 
to our veterans that has to do with ex-
panding VA veterans’ healthcare cov-
erage but specifically addresses the 
problem of our veterans who have been 
exposed to burn pits—toxic burn pits 
that have resulted in terrible illnesses, 
including cancer and others. 
The legislation we passed is named 
the Heath Robinson PACT Act. And 
people may wonder: Well, who is Heath 
Robinson? Why is it named after him? 
Heath 
Robinson 
was 
from 
Pickerington, OH, which is a small 
community outside of Columbus, OH. 
He enlisted in the Ohio National 
Guard. He became a sergeant first 
class. He did tours of duty in Kosovo 
and also in Iraq. He was with the 285th 
Area Support Medical Company and 
was a two-time Ohio Army National 
Guard NCO of the Year in 2012 and 
2013—so a very distinguished career in 
the military. 
In 2020, he died of cancer. And when 
you talk to the medical professionals, 
they say that his exposure to burn pits

is what resulted in his cancer devel-
oping and in the end of his life way too 
soon. 
So his widow Danielle, who some peo-
ple may remember was at the State of 
the Union up in the Gallery, and his 
mom Kathi and his daughter Brielle 
have been tireless advocates for ad-
dressing this burn pit issue, trying to 
stop the burn pits from being used but, 
of course, addressing the consequence 
of these burn pits. And they have chan-
neled their grief in a constructive way, 
which is to encourage Congress to pass 
this legislation that we passed today. 
So many other veterans who have been 
exposed to burn pits will now get their 
healthcare because of their work and 
because of the tribute that is being 
paid to their father and husband and 
son, Heath Robinson. 
So that is who Heath Robinson is, 
and that is why it was important to 
name that legislation today after him.

OTTO 
WARMBIER 
COUNTERING 
NORTH 
KOREAN 
CENSORSHIP 
AND SURVEILLANCE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
also rising today to ask unanimous 
consent from my colleagues to pass 
other legislation, S. 2129, a bipartisan 
bill that I have coauthored with my 
colleague from Ohio, Senator SHERROD 
BROWN. It honors a young man named 
Otto Warmbier, and it counters North 
Korea’s censorship and surveillance 
state. 
Otto Warmbier was a native of my 
hometown in Cincinnati, OH, and his 
wonderful family are dear friends. He 
was a young man of great spirit, great 
intellect, and great promise. He was a 
student, a star at the University of Vir-
ginia. 
In 2015, he went to North Korea with 
a tour group. It was a cultural visit 
with people from the United States, 
from Europe, looking to see what 
North Korea was like. They were there 
for a very brief period of time, but at 
the end of that brief visit, as he was 
waiting in line at the airport to leave 
with fellow members of the tour, North 
Korean security officials grabbed him 
and pulled him out of line. 
He was detained, and then eventually 
he was sentenced for 15 years on 
trumped-up charges relating to wheth-
er or not he tried to take down a poster 
that was a political poster—15 years. 
Otto Warmbier, again, a young man of 
great promise, was unjustly convicted 
and imprisoned. And during a 17-month 
period of imprisonment, captivity, he 
was badly mistreated by the North Ko-
reans, to the point that when he was 
returned to the United States in 2017, 
he came back in a comatose state from 
which he never recovered. 
Otto Warmbier died almost exactly 5 
years ago today, June 19, 2017. He was 
22 years old, with his whole life ahead 
of him. So 5 years ago, life changed for-
ever for Otto’s friends, for his parents, 
his classmates. His service, his funeral 
was extraordinary, the outpouring of 
love. 
His parents, Fred and Cindy, have 
taken their grief and done something 
very constructive with it. They have 
focused on exposing what North Korea 
is really like and also ensuring that, to 
the extent possible, North Korea is 
held accountable for this atrocity. No 
parent should have to endure what 
they went through. 
I have worked with Senators BROWN, 
COONS, 
TILLIS, 
VAN
HOLLEN, 
and 
HAGERTY, as well as the Warmbiers, as 
well as the Biden administration, on 
this legislation. It is called the Otto 
Warmbier North Korea Censorship and 
Surveillance Act. It would authorize 
sanctions against any foreign individ-
uals involved in censoring the North 
Korean people’s access to information 
on behalf of the Kim Jong Un regime. 
Of course, the North Koreans aren’t 
getting the truth because information 
is censored. So it is very important to 
get whatever real news you can into 
the country. When that happens, what 
you find out is that people leave North 
Korea and then work against the re-
gime. But so many people don’t have 
access to that information. 
So this bill authorizes the U.S. Agen-
cy for Global Media to find new and 
creative ways to circumvent North Ko-
rean censorship and provides $10 mil-
lion annually for the next 5 years to 
counter North Korea’s repressive cen-
sorship and surveillance state, includ-
ing something very practical and need-
ed, which is repairing the antennas 
that have been used for this purpose 
that were damaged in a typhoon years 
ago and have never been fixed because 
we haven’t had the funding. 
This bill has adequate funding to put 
in place the infrastructure that is now 
going to be necessary to effectively 
send true, accurate information to 
North Korea to counter North Korean 
propaganda for the sake of the people 
of North Korea. 
Together, this Chamber can send a 
bipartisan message to the world that 
we will not stand for the censorship 
and the repression of the North Korean 
regime. So I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this legislation. It is something 
we have worked on carefully. We have 
gotten technical assistance from the 
administration. It is something that I 
hope we can pass here this evening and 
then we can, in turn, get it passed in 
the House of Representatives and get it 
to the President for his signature. 
So, Mr. President, I would now like 
to call up this legislation. I ask unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of Cal-
endar No. 159, S. 2129. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2129) to promote freedom of infor-
mation and counter censorship and surveil-
lance in North Korea, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Foreign Relations with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Otto Warmbier 
Countering North Korean Censorship and Sur-
veillance Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the following 
findings: 
(1) The information landscape in North Korea 
is the most repressive in the world, consistently 
ranking last or near-last in the annual World 
Press Freedom Index. 
(2) Under the brutal rule of Kim Jung Un, the 
country’s leader since 2012, the North Korean 
regime has tightened controls on access to infor-
mation, as well as enacted harsh punishments 
for consumers of outside media, including sen-
tencing to time in a concentration camp and a 
maximum penalty of death. 
(3) Such repressive and unjust laws sur-
rounding information in North Korea resulted 
in the death of 22-year-old United States citizen 
and university student Otto Warmbier, who had 
traveled to North Korea in December 2015 as 
part of a guided tour. 
(4) Otto Warmbier was unjustly arrested, sen-
tenced to 15 years of hard labor, and severely 
mistreated at the hands of North Korean offi-
cials. While in captivity, Otto Warmbier suffered 
a serious medical emergency that placed him 
into a comatose state. Otto Warmbier was coma-
tose upon his release in June 2017 and died 6 
days later. 
(5) Despite increased penalties for possession 
and viewership of foreign media, the people of 
North Korean have increased their desire for 
foreign media content, according to a survey of 
200 defectors concluding that 90 percent had 
watched South Korean or other foreign media 
before defecting. 
(6) On March 23, 2021, in an annual resolu-
tion, the United Nations General Assembly con-
demned ‘‘the long-standing and ongoing system-
atic, widespread and gross violations of human 
rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea’’ and expressed grave concern at, among 
other things, ‘‘the denial of the right to freedom 
of thought, conscience, and religion . . . and of 
the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and 
association, both online and offline, which is 
enforced through an absolute monopoly on in-
formation and total control over organized so-
cial life, and arbitrary and unlawful state sur-
veillance that permeates the private lives of all 
citizens’’. 
(7) In 2018, Typhoon Yutu caused extensive 
damage to 15 broadcast antennas used by the 
United States Agency for Global Media in Asia, 
resulting in reduced programming to North 
Korea. The United States Agency for Global 
Media has rebuilt 5 of the 15 antenna systems as 
of June 2021. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) in the event of a crisis situation, particu-
larly where information pertaining to the crisis 
is being actively censored or a false narrative is 
being put forward, the United States should be 
able to quickly increase its broadcasting capa-
bility to deliver fact-based information to audi-
ences, including those in North Korea; and 
(2) the United States International Broad-
casting Surge Capacity Fund is already author-
ized under section 316 of the United States 
International Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 
U.S.C. 6216), and expanded authority to trans-
fer unobligated balances from expired accounts 
of the United States Agency for Global Media 
would enable the Agency to more nimbly re-
spond to crises. 
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to provide the people of North Korea with 
access to a diverse range of fact-based informa-
tion;

communication and information sharing that 
increase opportunities for audiences in North 
Korea to safely create, access, and share digital 
and non-digital news without fear of repressive 
censorship, surveillance, or penalties under law;

RECOGNIZING 
AND 
CONGRATU-
LATING 
LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL 
ERIC S. MARSHALL, P.E., PMP 
HON. MICHAEL F. Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Lieuten-
ant Colonel Eric S. Marshall, P.E., PMP on the 
occasion of his retirement from the United 
States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) 
after over 20 years of service to our Nation. I 
further commend him for his exemplary lead-
ership, innovation, and commitment to collabo-
ration for the People of Guam, our Pacific re-
gion, this country, and populations across the 
world. 
Building the foundations for an accom-
plished military and engineering career, Lt. 
Col. Marshall obtained a bachelor’s degree in 
physics and math from the U.S. Air Force 
Academy in 2002. He then went on to earn a 
master’s degree in nuclear engineering from 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and 
completed further training and education from 
Command and General Staff College in 2015. 
Beyond his practical instruction, however, Lt. 
Col. Marshall embodies a strength of char-
acter, dedication to problem-solving, and fidel-
ity to service that speaks volumes of his pro-
pensity for excellence. 
Lt. Col. Marshall’s background in national 
defense spans numerous command positions 
and wartime deployments. From Platoon 
Leader, Detachment Commander, and Oper-
ations Officer with the U.S. Army Dive Com-
pany to Resident Engineer with USACE in Af-
ghanistan, 
Project 
Manager, 
Construction 
Manager, and Emergency Operations with the 
U.S. Corps of Engineers, Company Com-
mander of the 1–48 Infantry Battalion, Squad-
ron Commander and Executive Officer of the 
U.S. Army Special Operations Command 
Headquarters in Fort Bragg, and Deputy Bri-
gade Commander of the Schofield Barracks 
130 Engineer Brigade, he maintains a diverse 
history of contributions that have and continue 
to empower communities across borders. In 
consistently rising to answer the call of service 
over the years, Lt. Col. Marshall has tirelessly 
worked to meet critical engineering and con-
struction needs in locations such as the Phil-
ippines, Hawaii, the provinces of Paktya, 
Paktika, Ghazni, and Khost, and New Orleans 
in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. More-
over, he has assumed vital roles in realizing 
successful deployment missions in Iraq, Af-
ghanistan, Libya, and Syria in addition to rais-
ing up a new generation of leaders and vision-
aries as a Course Director and Assistant Pro-
fessor of Physics at the U.S. Military Acad-
emy. 
In over two decades with the Department of 
Defense, Lt. Col. Marshall has not simply 
trained thousands of enlistees, supervised 
thousands more personnel, realized hundreds 
of domestic and international projects, and 
managed billions of dollars in funding—he has 
cultivated an outstanding record of going 
above and beyond for others. In his capacity 
as Commander of the USACE Honolulu. Dis-
trict, Lt. Col. Marshall and his team estab-
lished strong working relationships and com-
munications channels with Guam leaders. 
More specifically, our Guam Congressional Of-
fice collaborated closely with USACE to ad-
vance the resolution of longstanding commu-
nity health and infrastructure challenges rel-
ative to the construction of a new Guam Med-
ical Campus and island-wide erosion issues. 
His recognitions including numerous campaign 
medals, a Bronze Star Award, and USACE 
Agency 2022 Federal Engineer of the Year 
Award are a further testament to his distinction 
as a force of positive transformation. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 
People of Guam, offering my deepest appre-
ciation for his dedication to our island, region, 
and country. Throughout his career, and espe-
cially through his leadership with USACE, 
Lieutenant Colonel Eric S. Marshall has admi-
rably brought new meaning to the Anny values 
of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, 
honor, integrity, and personal courage. More-
over, he has established a lasting legacy of in-
genuity and outcomes charged with purpose. I 
sincerely thank Lieutenant Colonel Eric S. 
Marshall for his many years of service and 
sacrifice, congratulate him on his well-earned 
retirement, and wish him and his wife Ali the 
best during the next chapter of their lives.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF RICHARD TARIFF 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Richard Tariff of Long-
meadow, Massachusetts who is bringing a 
close to a long and impactful career as an ed-
ucator who made a positive difference in the 
lives of thousands of middle school students, 
as well as adult students in eastern Con-
necticut. In a few short weeks, he is set to re-
tire in August as Director of Adult and Com-
munity Programs at EASTCONN after more 
than four decades of specializing in the field of 
adult education. Today, however, he will par-
ticipate in his final graduation ceremony at 
Parish Hill High School in Chaplin, Con-
necticut. This graduation like the dozens and 
dozens that preceded it, is the moment where 
all his hard work-done in tandem with his col-
leagues—culminates in a successful degree 
for their students that will transform their lives 
for the better. 
A New England native, Rich began his jour-
ney in education teaching elementary and 
middle school students in Stafford Springs, 
which lit the fire of a life-time calling to elevate 
public schools’ students to their highest poten-
tial. Understanding the intrinsic value of life- 
long education for students of all ages, Rich 
became a part-time director for Stafford 
Springs’ Adult Education programs in 1979. As 
part-time director, he witnessed first-hand the 
lack of options for adults seeking certification 
outside of a high school diploma, which for 
him was a glaring opportunity for our district. 
Vision in hand, Rich became the Adult Edu-
cation Director for Adult Basic Education for 
the 12-town Tolland County region a few short 
years later. Under his leadership, the regional 
program underwent monumental evolutions. 
By establishing and engaging with partner-
ships, Vernon Regional Adult Education not 
only witnessed major expansions in enrich-
ment program participation but also the plan-
ning, creation, and implementation of the for-
malized Vernon Regional Adult High School. 
By upgrading and centralizing the educational 
resources available through the programs 
under his watch, Rich, in just a couple of 
years of tenure as Director, began what has 
become a permanent legacy in the region and 
has resulted in thousands of adults graduating 
to date. 
In 1984, Rich returned to youth education 
as the Assistant Principal at Vernon Center 
Middle School. He remained in this role for 16 
years, where his value for and experience in 
administrating learning programs only contin-
ued to grow. He could not keep away from 
Vernon Regional Adult Education, however, 
and took on a new role as Regional Super-
visor and Coordinator with the organization 
which he remained at for another eight years. 
Through both roles, Rich’s expertise in grant 
writing and implementation helped maintain 
Vernon and the surrounding area’s competitive 
edge in terms of better preparing our commu-
nity for not just their future but the demands 
of a changing workforce. For example, at 
Vernon Center, he helped write a National 
21st Century Grant request that had brought 
unprecedented grant funding to the district. 
Meanwhile, at Vernon Regional Adult Edu-
cation, Rich expanded coordination with state 
partners to offer Work Place Education and 
both received and protected a grant for Col-
lege Transition resources. 
Though Vernon Regional was foundational 
to his experience in Adult Education, Rich’s 
history of pioneering in the field earned him 
his latest role as Director of Adult and Com-
munity Programs for EASTCONN, one of Con-
necticut’s six public, non-profit Regional Edu-
cational Service Centers. At EASTCONN, Rich 
has been bestowed the rightfully placed privi-
lege to manage adult education services for 
what is now a 21-town region sprawling 
throughout 
northeastern 
Connecticut. 
The 
scope and size of EASTCONN’s adult edu-
cation programs were not achieved by mis-
take—it was Rich who helped charge the ef-
fectiveness of the organization. He understood 
that in districts comprised of smaller commu-
nities such as ours it does not just take a vil-
lage, but rather several. With his guiding phi-
losophy of centralizing resources in mind, Rich 
has brought about major achievements in 
terms of adequately preparing our district’s

workforce. Two of such achievements are the 
integration of adult programs with the two 
American Job Centers in northeastern Con-
necticut, and ensuring the strength of virtual 
educational adult and youth programs through-
out the pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I have known Rich as a 
friend and community leader for almost forty 
years. I have seen firsthand his intelligent em-
pathetic and kind interaction with people from 
all walks of life. He is down-to-earth and 
funny. Madame Speaker, it is an honor to rep-
resent constituents as community-oriented as 
Rich Tariff. A lifelong educator with a pench-
ant for innovation, Rich has understood from 
an early age the opportunities that can arise 
for communities who hone their skills and 
keep themselves adaptable. As a reflection of 
his abilities, it is worth finally noting that Rich 
was the first President of the Connecticut As-
sociation for Adult and Continuing Education 
to serve for 5 consecutive years from 2011 to 
2016, leading advocacy efforts within and be-
yond Connecticut on behalf of adult learners. 
For decades, Rich has spurred job growth im-
parting the educational foundation necessary 
for any occupation and our state and region 
has benefitted in ways that most fellow citi-
zens will never know. His shoes will be hard 
to fill. Madam Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in recognizing 
and thanking Rich Tariff for his life’s work, set-
ting his legacy further into stone.

RECOGNIZING 
MAJOR 
JOHN 
W. 
BARRY 
USA 
(RET.) 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY 
HON. LISA C. McCLAIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of 
Major John W. Barry USA (Ret.), who will be 
interred on Friday June 17th at Arlington Na-
tional Cemetery. 
John was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 
on October 28, 1930. He later became a na-
tive of St. Clair, Michigan, before passing 
away on January 9, 2021. 
John lived a long and fruitful life devoted to 
service, country, and family. Enlisting in the 
Army in 1952, John had a 20-year career that 
was defined by distinguished service and lead-
ership. During this time, John earned his avia-
tion wings in both rotary and fixed wing air-
craft, and fought in the Korea and Vietnam 
conflicts as a Huey Helicopter Captain, In Viet-
nam, he and his co-pilot were wounded and 
later received the Purple Heart for wounds in 
action. 
In addition to the Purple Heart, John re-
ceived 20 other honors, which were awarded 
for missions flown, contact with the enemy, 
and individually. These honors include the 
Bronze Star Medal, Air Medal, Good Conduct 
Medal, the United Nations Service Medal 
(Korea), Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with palm, 
Army Commendation, and much more. 
Upon his retirement, John worked at 
Prestolite and Port Huron schools before his 
eventual retirement in 1999. In addition, John 
was a VFW Life Member and member of 
American Legion Post 449. 
Madam Speaker, I thank John for his serv-
ice to our country and the example he set for 
all Michiganders. My heartfelt condolences go 
out to his family and loved ones who I hope 
find solace in the fact that John lived a long, 
distinguished, and full life. They could not ask 
for anything more. Again, I thank Major Barry; 
we will never forget his service.

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES NO. 11: 
BIODEFENSE AND NBAF 
HON. TRACEY MANN 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, in preparation 
for reauthorizing the Farm Bill in 2023, I rise 
today to deliver the eleventh installment of my 
Farm Bill Impact Series, where I am high-
lighting various aspects of the Farm Bill that 
deserve Congress’ awareness and support. 
We need robust biosecurity in America not 
only because we need to eat in order to sur-
vive, but also because strong American agri-
culture will help keep our country free and 
self-determining as a Nation. 
Manhattan, KS, the home of my alma mater 
Kansas State University, is also home to the 
National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or 
NBAF. This state-of-the-art, 700,000 square 
foot facility will be a national asset that helps 
protects our nation’s agriculture against the 
threat and potential impact of serious animal 
diseases. Experts believe that 75 percent of 
new and emerging infectious animal diseases 
can be transmitted from animals to humans. 
NBAF will be home to the only maximum bio-
containment space in the country, where 
USDA will be conduct comprehensive re-
search, develop vaccines and anti-virals, and 
explore enhanced diagnostic and training ca-
pabilities. 
The United States Department of Agriculture 
is currently working with the Department of 
Homeland Security to bring NBAF online by 
this December, and to begin establishing part-
nerships between two key sectors heavily in-
vested in animal health: academia and indus-
try. Working with scientists and other industry 
professionals, NBAF will create new safety 
and security guidelines that will be critical for 
the prevention of future pandemics. Currently, 
scientists are conducting this very important 
research in New York at the Plum Island Ani-
mal Disease Center, which is more than 60 
years old. NBAF will replace this aging facility, 
create 400 local jobs for Kansans, generate 
over $100 million in total economic benefit for 
our state, and make Kansas the home of inter-
nationally recognized animal disease experts. 
NBAF isn’t just an exciting development for 
Kansas, it also marks the future of biodefense 
research that will protect the United States 
and the world. 
The 2018 Farm Bill contained special au-
thorization for biosecurity planning and re-
sponse, which helped make NBAF possible. 
That version of the bill explicitly mentioned, 
‘‘the coordination of tactical science activities 
to protect the integrity, reliability, sustainability, 
and profitability of the food and agricultural 
system of the United States against biosecu-
rity threats from pests, diseases, contami-
nants, and disasters.’’ NBAF is a concrete ex-
ample of the impact that we can have when 
we reauthorize the Farm Bill in careful and 
creative ways. 
During National Agriculture Month in March, 
I brought House Agriculture Committee Re-
publican Leader GT Thompson on an Ag tour 
of Kansas where I was proud to show him 
NBAF. The technology, scale, and inter-
national significance of the facility is truly sec-
ond to none. Once fully operational in Decem-
ber, NBAF won’t just support and protect agri-
culture, it will protect our country and the 
world. I’ll be back on the floor soon to deliver 
another installment of my Farm Bill Impact Se-
ries and highlight more programs and titles 
within the Bill that I believe Congress must un-
derstand and support to ensure that agri-
culture thrives in America.

Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant 
General Richard ‘‘Rich’’ Scobee for his retire-
ment as Chief of the Air Force Reserve and 
Commander of the Air Force Reserve Com-
mand, and to thank him for his many years of

RECOVERING AMERICA’S 
WILDLIFE ACT, H.R. 2773 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, as a 
sportsman, I have long been a supporter and 
cosponsor of the Recovering America’s Wild-
life Act (RAWA). 
This bipartisan legislation aims to promote 
and enhance Virginia’s and our nation’s con-
servation efforts and ensure the health of fish 
and wildlife across the U.S. RAWA would pro-
vide dedicated funding for the implementation 
of state fish and wildlife agencies’ action plans 
and complement the American System of 
Conservation Funding, which is the financial 
contributions of hunters, anglers, target shoot-
ers, and boaters through excise taxes and re-
lated user fees, to ensure healthy populations 
of fish and wildlife for future generations to 
enjoy. 
These conservation efforts could include re-
introduction of imperiled species, conserving 
and 
restoring 
important 
habitat, 
fighting 
invasive species and disease, and more. This 
would significantly reduce the number of spe-
cies in decline and would ultimately prevent 
these species from needing protections af-
forded under the Endangered Species Act. 
Restoring fish, wildlife, and their habitats is an 
effective way to restore critical natural infra-
structure, create resilient habitats and commu-
nities, create jobs, and is an issue of national 
importance that has no political affiliation. 
Unfortunately, I was not able to support 
H.R. 2773 on the House floor (Roll No. 267) 
because of changes to the bill text and failed 
attempts to address spending offsets after the 
Natural Resources Committee reported the bill 
on June 9, 2022. The bill that came to the 
floor contained substantial differences than the 
original introduced version of H.R. 2773. Addi-
tionally, the Majority failed to work with Repub-
licans to address spending offsets and include 
a sunset provision. 
I still support the original intent of RAWA to 
support State and tribal conservation efforts to 
restore wildlife. I look forward to Senate action 
to advance these goals while addressing the 
concerns of Natural Resources Committee Re-
publicans and bill cosponsors that arouse 
when this legislation was considered on the 
House floor.

HONORING KENNETH ‘‘BABYFACE’’ 
EDMONDS, 
SINGER, 
SONG-
WRITER, AND PRODUCER 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Kenneth Edmonds, better known as 
Babyface, an Indianapolis native, who will be 
inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Cen-
ter Walk of Fame on June 17, 2022. 
Kenneth was born in Indianapolis to Marvin 
and Barbara Edmonds and raised in our great 
city. He began songwriting at the young age of 
12 years old, and after taking on the name 
Babyface, he signed his first record deal after 
joining his first band Manchild. He later joined 
The Deele which enjoyed a fast breakthrough 
into the music world for their R&B and funk 
hits. 
Kenneth has created a legacy through his 
music. His second album, ‘‘Tender Lover’’, 
which included the hit singles ‘‘It’s No Crime’’ 
and ‘‘Whip Appeal’’, went double platinum and 
became a critically acclaimed triumph. Baby-
face continued to share his talents as a co- 
songwriter with noteworthy artists such as 
Johnny Gill, Whitney Houston, and Boyz II 
Men. He was later nominated for a Grammy 
Award for Album of the Year for his unforget-
table work on The Bodyguard Soundtrack. 
Kenneth went on to release ‘‘For the Cool in 
You’’, winning his first Grammy for ‘‘When I 
Can See You Again’’ for Best Male R&B 
Vocal. While continuing to win consecutive 
Grammys for Producer of Year, and working 
with versatile artists, he released, starred, and 
created the soundtrack for the 1997 movie, 
Soul Food. 
Throughout his successes, Kenneth has 
maintained a respectful approach to his work 
and an endearing sense of humility—typifying 
our beloved Hoosier values. He has three chil-
dren for whom he sets a remarkable example. 
Kenneth is a dedicated philanthropist, sup-
porting organizations making a difference in 
the fields of health, education, and more. His 
list of achievements and awards are impres-
sive, and his hometown is overjoyed with his 
latest recognition from the Madam Walker 
Legacy Center. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring Kenny ‘‘Babyface’’ Edmonds. Our 
community is proud of his success and impact 
in the music industry, Indiana and our country.

RECOVERING AMERICA’S 
WILDLIFE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the Recovering Amer-
ica’s Wildlife Act, legislation that I have co-
sponsored which would strengthen our re-
sponse to habitat loss, climate change, and 
disease impacting the health and well-being of 
threatened and endangered wildlife throughout 
our country. 
Habitat loss, climate change, invasive spe-
cies, disease, and severe weather have all 
taken a severe toll on birds, mammals, fish, 
amphibians, reptiles, butterflies, and bees. It is 
important that we take bold steps and invest 
in collaborative solutions to protect our wildlife. 
According to the National Wildlife Federa-
tion, approximately one-third of bird species in 
North America are in urgent need of conserva-
tion action and over forty percent of American 
freshwater fish are currently at risk of extinc-
tion. Recent ecological changes, such as the 
increasing number of wildfires and rising aver-
age water temperatures, are pushing many 
species of animals towards endangerment and 
extinction. As the representative for the great 
city of Milwaukee, located on beautiful Lake 
Michigan, I know just how important wildlife is 
to our economy, outdoor recreation, and the 
well-being of the environment. 
This bill would bring much-needed re-
sources to state, local and tribal wildlife pro-
fessionals tasked with conserving wildlife and 
their habitat. The legislation would provide 
funding for the conservation or restoration of 
wildlife and plant species of the greatest con-
servation need, to implement the wildlife con-
servation strategies of states, territories, the 
District of Columbia and tribal governments, 
and support wildlife conservation education 
and recreation projects. Unless we invest in 
proactive, innovative solutions, we risk losing 
thousands of species. 
I was happy to support this bill. Passing this 
legislation would be a good step in our con-
tinuing efforts to protect our environment and 
wildlife for the enjoyment of current and future 
generations.

HONORING PRESIDENT PAUL TRI-
BLE ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM 
CHRISTOPHER 
NEWPORT 
UNI-
VERSITY 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the Honorable Paul 
Trible for his 26 years of extraordinary service 
as the president of Christopher Newport Uni-
versity located in Newport News, Virginia. 
Prior to his service at Christopher Newport 
University, President Trible served as a Com-
monwealth’s Attorney for Essex County, Vir-
ginia before being elected to represent Vir-
ginia’s First Congressional District in the 
United States House of Representatives. After 
serving three terms in this chamber, President 
Trible was then elected to the United States 
Senate, where he served one term. After 
working as a teaching fellow at Harvard Uni-
versity, he returned to the Virginia Peninsula 
to serve as president of Christopher Newport 
University. 
Over the course of his tenure, President Tri-
ble has ensured that Christopher Newport Uni-
versity has remained focused on both the aca-
demic achievement and personal development 
of its students, a focus which is exemplified by 
the establishment of the President’s Leader-
ship Program. Through a combination of aca-

Under Mr. Trible’s presidency, enrollment at 
Christopher Newport grew from 2,920 to over 
4,700, with a graduation rate of 74 percent. 
Full-time faculty also increased from 166 to 
282, and the university library’s holdings in-
creased to 1.2 million volumes. In 1996, Presi-
dent Trible worked with then-Delegate Alan 
Diamonstein to secure a $5 million appropria-
tion for the university’s Ferguson Center for 
the Arts and a 21 percent increase in the uni-
versity’s operating funds. Since then, Presi-

struction projects, including the recent $60 mil-
lion, 83,00-square-foot Mary M. Torggler Fine

Madam Speaker, as the Christopher New-
port University community gathers to celebrate 
a truly remarkable leader, I want to congratu-
late Paul Trible on 26 years of legendary serv-
ice to Christopher Newport University, and 
over 50 years of service to the Commonwealth 
of Virginia and the nation. I also want to thank 
Rosemary Trible, his wife and partner for over 
40 years, for her countless contributions, and 
their two children—Mary Katherine and Paul. I 
thank President Trible for his decades of serv-
ice and congratulations on a well-deserved re-
tirement.

CONGRATULATING LIVING LANDS 
& WATERS ON THEIR 25TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF CLEANING AMER-
ICA’S RIVERS 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Living Land & Waters for clean-
ing America’s rivers for 25 years. Based in 
East Moline, they are the only industrial 
strength river clean-up organization in the 
world. 
Living Lands & Waters was founded in 1998 
by Chad Pregracke, with the mission of help-
ing to protect, preserve and restore the natural 
environment of America’s major rivers and 
their watersheds. By expanding awareness of 
environmental issues and creating a desire 
and opportunity for citizens to take an active 
role, they are helping to make a cleaner river 
environment for all of us. The Living Lands & 
Waters crew lives up to nine months a year on 
their barge and hosts river cleanups, water-
shed conservation initiative workshops, tree 
plantings and other key conservation efforts. 
Impressively, they have removed over 10 mil-
lion pounds of trash from rivers around the 
country. 
It is because of community organizations 
such as Living Lands & Waters that I am es-
pecially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
again formally congratulate Living Lands & 
Waters on its 25th Anniversary of cleaning up 
our country’s rivers.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
MELISSA 
SANDOVAL 
AND 
MARVIN 
MACAULEY 
HON. TERESA LEGER FERNA´NDEZ 
OF NEW MEXICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Ms. LEGER FERNA´ NDEZ. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor Melissa Sandoval and 
Marvin MacAuley. 
Currently, wildfires are devastating my dis-
trict. These fires have ravaged sacred, cul-
tural, and familiar spaces while destroying ev-
erything in their paths. Tens of thousands of 
people are displaced and uncertainty sur-
rounds us. But, in this time of devastation, 
there are people who continue to give so 
much of themselves to meet the needs of their 
communities. 
Some of these exemplary people include 
Superintendent Melissa Sandoval of Pen˜asco 
Independent 
Schools 
and 
Superintendent 
Marvin 
MacAuley 
of 
Mora 
Independent 
Schools. 
Many communities in rural New Mexico are 
unincorporated or census-designated places 
without mayors, a town council, emergency 
managers, or special project coordinators. De-
spite this, communities like Pen˜asco and Mora 
are fortunate to have extraordinary super-
intendents. 
When evacuation orders were looming and 
the need to prepare was imminent, Super-
intendents Sandoval and MacAuley got to-
gether and coordinated a response to provide 
shelter, warm meals, and a safe space for 
hundreds of displaced community members. 
They stepped up for their communities when it 
was least convenient. 
I had the privilege of meeting with Super-
intendents Sandoval and MacAuley at the 
Pen˜asco Middle School evacuation site. As I 
walked through the gym and spoke to evac-
uees, their gratitude for the space created by 
Sandoval, MacAuley, and their teams, was 
evident. While these individuals and families 
were losing their homes, Sandoval and 
MacAuley ensured that they had fewer things 
to worry about. 
People like Melissa and Marvin exemplify 
the strength of our communities. Their efforts 
remind us of the importance of showing up 
and stepping up for our neighbors whether 
through small everyday actions or large col-
laborative efforts. 
Superintendents Sandoval and MacAuley 
represent the best of us. 
I commend these two remarkable individuals 
for their leadership. I am thankful to them for 
all they have done and continue to do for their 
students and communities throughout northern 
New Mexico.

RECOGNIZING MRS. STACY COGGIN 
HON. MIKE BOST 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. BOST. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize and congratulate a dedicated pro-
fessional with the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs on the occasion of her retirement. Mrs. 
Stacy Coggin is an exemplary public servant 
who has demonstrated the highest standards 
of professionalism on a daily basis. She has 
served with the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs, Office for Congressional and Legislative 
Affairs the last five years of her more than 22 
years in federal service. Her career in faithful 
public service is a testament to the importance 
of selfless service. 
For the last 5 years, Mrs. Coggin served as 
Congressional Relations Officer in the office of 
Congressional and Legislative Affairs. She has 
been involved in a remarkable breadth of im-
portant VA programs across the Department 
including compensation and benefits claims, 
appeals, and field operations. In this capacity, 
she spearheaded support for more than nine 
hundred Congressional oversight actions, from 
requests for information to Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs hearings, helping this body en-
sure our Nation’s veterans and their families 
receive the care and benefits they deserve. 
As Mrs. Coggin embarks on a new chapter 
in life, it is my hope that she may recall, with 
a deep sense of pride and accomplishment, 
the outstanding contributions she has made to 
the Department of Veterans Affairs, the House 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and the veterans 
of the United States. May her life be filled with 
health and happiness.

FEDERAL RESERVE RACIAL AND 
ECONOMIC EQUITY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. DOUG LaMALFA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, June 15, 2022 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, while I cannot 
rise in support of H.R. 2543, I would like to 
highlight one piece of this package that will 
make a difference in this district. Mr. Speaker, 
rural and low-income communities have many 
things in common including lack of access to 
financial services. In a rural area such as my 
district, constituents often drive 20–40 miles, 
even crossing county lines to receive access 
to their own funds. This is the case in more 
than one of the counties in my district. I want 
to applaud the efforts of the credit unions 
which are highlighted in this bill and support 
their efforts to bring more financial services to 
rural and unserved communities.

VISTA FIELD 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize an exciting addition to Cen-
tral Washington that has been years in the 
making. 
Vista Field, formally a municipal airport, is 
well on its way to becoming a vibrant and pe-
destrian-focused town center with neighbor-
hoods and urban lifestyle amenities. The 103 
acres of land will introduce 1,000 single-family 
homes, retail shops, restaurants, and enter-
tainment 
to 
the 
growing 
community 
of 
Kennewick. The Port of Kennewick is cele-
brating this new addition to the community by 
hosting a grand opening celebration, today, 
where community members can be the first to 
see the new public amenities, such as a com-
mercial plaza, pedestrian bridges, fountains, 
and ponds. 
Once completed, this new urban develop-
ment is expected to bring in $51 million in in-
frastructure investments in addition to over 
3,000 jobs for our local community, contrib-
uting to a thriving local economy. 
Vista Field is a perfect example of the inno-
vative projects that are possible when local 
leadership and community collaboration are at 
the forefront, and I am excited to see this 
project take form and bring new opportunities 
for everyone in our community to enjoy.

HONORING 
JAN ZIMMERMAN ON 
HER RETIREMENT AS CHIEF OF 
POLICE IN RAYMORE 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished career of 
Chief Jan Zimmerman of the Raymore Police 
Department. After more than four decades of 
selfless service working in public safety, Chief 
Zimmerman has announced her intent to re-
tire. She has established an inspiring career 
and legacy that is a true testament to the 
value Missouri’s public servants bring to their 
communities. 
Beginning a career in public safety in 1979, 
Jan served the Kansas City Police Department 
(KCPD) as a dispatcher; shortly thereafter, 
she attended the Kansas City Police Academy 
and was sworn in as a KCPD police officer in 
1982. Throughout her career in law enforce-
ment, Jan served the KCPD with distinction by 
rising through the ranks of sergeant (1987), 
captain (1994), and ultimately concluded her 
tenure as major (2000). Jan holds a BA in 
Criminal Justice, an MA in Public Administra-
tion, and is an alumnus of the FBI National 
Academy in Quantico. 
Joining the Raymore Police Department as 
Chief of Police in 2012, Jan Zimmerman has 
led the department through tumultuous times 
providing unremitting leadership. Chief Zim-
merman places high expectations on her offi-
cers, committing herself to provide quality 
training and setting an example for the next 
generation of public safety professionals. 
Jan also championed mental health by 
partnering with healthcare professionals to de-
velop the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) and 
implement the program at the KCPD and the 
Raymore 
Police 
Department. 
Later, 
she 
served as a Jackson County Mental Health 
Court Commissioner and considers this expe-
rience one of her proudest accomplishments. 
Zimmerman is the first female in the history of 
the Missouri Police Chiefs Association to re-
ceive the Donald ‘‘Red’’ Loehr Outstanding 
Police Chief award for her achievements in 
ensuring public safety. 
Law enforcement officers face many difficult, 
sometimes fatal, challenges. To support fallen 
officers’ families, Jan serves as a program di-
rector for the Surviving Spouse and Family 
Endowment Fund with the Kansas City Crime 
Commission. 
For over a decade, Chief Zimmerman has 
put the safety and wellbeing of Raymore resi-
dents above her own. With the support of fam-
ily; her husband, Major David Zimmerman of 
the Kansas City Police Department; her 
daughters, Jackie and Britt; and her grand-
daughters, Elise and Michele, Jan has with-
stood the hardships that are all too common in 
law enforcement. 
Today, thanks to the leadership of Chief Jan 
Zimmerman, Raymore residents enjoy safer 
neighborhoods, exceptional emergency serv-
ices, and a police department that serves with 
integrity. On behalf of Missouri’s Fourth Con-
gressional District, I thank Chief Zimmerman 
for answering the call to serve and protect our 
community. Congratulations on a well-de-
served retirement. 
BRINGING ATTENTION TO THE 
LEFT’S WAR ON AGRICULTURE 
HON. RONNY JACKSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. JACKSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to bring attention to a serious issue fac-
ing all of rural America: the Biden Administra-
tion and the radical Left’s War on Agriculture. 
Today, the House will vote on H.R. 7606, 
which will exacerbate fractured supply chains, 
skyrocketing input costs, and historic levels of 
inflation, all of which are hammering American 
consumers. 
This bill is the latest attempt to scapegoat 
private industry rather than address the real 
needs and concerns of farmers, ranchers, and 
rural Americans. 
We know the Biden Administration and my 
colleagues across the aisle see Americans in 
the oil and gas industry as the enemy, and I 
truly believe they now see farmers and ranch-
ers as the enemy too. 
I want my constituents back home in Texas 
to know this is something I’m fighting every 
day. 
I represent the number 1 Ag district in 
Texas, and the farmers and ranchers in my 
district are experiencing out of control input 
costs for fertilizer, fuel, and basic parts for 
equipment. I can assure you the legislation 
we’re voting on today will make matters 
worse. 
A spending and regulatory agenda that 
compounds the situation and further limits the 
American Ag industry’s ability to meet global 
food demands is not the answer. 
Instead, I urge the Speaker to abandon this 
bill and bring H.R. 8069, the Reducing Farm 
Input Costs and Barriers to Domestic Produc-
tion Act, to the House Floor. 
H.R. 8069 will actually support our farmers 
and ranchers by ensuring they have regulatory 
certainty so that they may grow abundant and 
affordable food and fiber. 
Rather than generate additional layers of 
bureaucracy and regulatory compliance with 
H.R. 7606, Congress should take up H.R. 
8069 immediately. 
I thank Ranking Member G.T. THOMPSON for 
his leadership on the right approach, H.R. 
8069, and I urge my colleagues to vote NO on 
H.R. 7606.

RECOGNIZING JOHN F. GIBBS 
HON. TOM EMMER 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize John F. Gibbs for his 18 years of 
service to Comcast, over 40 years in the cable 
industry, and decades of dedication to his 
community and the state of Minnesota. Mr. 
Gibbs 
announced 
his 
retirement 
from 
Comcast, and although he will be greatly 
missed, his hard work and contributions have 
made a positive impact on the industry and 
community, ensuring he will not be forgotten. 
Mr. Gibbs joined Comcast in March 2003 
with more than 20 years of legal and tele-
communications experience. During his ten-
ure, he built and led an industry-leading state 
government affairs team that has achieved a 
strong record of successes across the country. 
Prior to 2003, he was a partner at the Min-
neapolis law firm of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & 
Ciresi, LLP, and practiced in the areas of com-
munications and regulatory law. While at the 
firm, he provided counsel to the franchise 
transfer activities associated with Comcast’s 
acquisition of AT&T Broadband and other 
major industry transactions, including the 
mergers of AT&T and MediaOne, AT&T and 
TCI, and AOL and Time Warner. Before join-
ing the Robins firm, Mr. Gibbs served as Vice 
President of Corporate & Legal Affairs for 
Continental Cablevision in Los Angeles from 
1986 to 1995. 
Long involved in community affairs, Mr. 
Gibbs was elected to the Three Rivers Park 
District Board of Commissioners in November 
2010. This park system is in the west subur-
ban Minneapolis/St. Paul metro area and man-
ages almost 27,000 acres of park reserves, 
regional parks, regional trails, and special-use 
facilities. Prior to this, Mr. Gibbs served for 10 
years on the Hennepin County Library Board 
where he served as president for three of 
those years. He is the former chair of the Hen-
nepin County Policy Advisory Committee, a 
former member of the. Bloomington, Min-
nesota Charter Commission, former member 
and chair of the Bloomington Cable Commis-
sion, and has served on a variety of non-profit 
boards. 
Currently, in addition to representing District 
5 on the Three Rivers Park Board, Mr. Gibbs 
serves on the boards of Artistry Theater and 
Visual Arts in Bloomington and the Minnesota 
River Valley Chapter of the Izaak Walton 
League. 
I congratulate Mr. Gibbs on his successful 
18-year career with Comcast and over 40 
years of leadership in an industry that has in-
vested 
heavily 
in 
America 
and 
through 
broadband improved the lives of the citizens of 
this country. I commend Mr. Gibbs on his dec-
ades of service to the State of Minnesota, 
Hennepin County, and the City of Bloom-
ington. I know the whole House joins me in 
wishing him the best in retirement and as he 
continues to serve his community as a valued 
and experienced leader.

RECOVERING AMERICA’S 
WILDLIFE ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, June 14, 2022 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my concerns with respect to H.R. 
2773, the Recovering America’s Wildlife Act. 
The bill has laudable goals and the potential 
positive impact on our nation’s wildlife con-
servation efforts is undeniable. I am a long-
standing proponent of environmental causes 
and the benefits of investing in them. 
However, the ends do not justify the means. 
Specifically, the bill provides an average of 
$1.4 billion per year in mandatory appropria-
tions from the General Fund indefinitely. As a 
result, this bill provides the additional funding 
on autopilot without any role for this or future 
Congresses to scrutinize the details and value

of this massive investment. Additionally, the 
House Parliamentarian’s Office has also con- 
firmed to my staff that this bill presents signifi-
cant jurisdictional issues with respect to the 
House’s rule against appropriating in an au-
thorizing bill. 
I believe there is a better way forward that 
is consistent with the longstanding regular 
order of this body. Subjecting this funding to 
the appropriations process would ensure that 
we make these valuable investments in our 
nation’s wildlife while at the same time pre-
serving the important role Congress must play 
in overseeing our Article I responsibilities. 
It pains me that we were not able to resolve 
these differences because as a longtime ap-
propriator, I fully understand the need for ro-
bust, long-term investments to protect our en-
vironment and natural habitats. However, as 
chair of the House Committee on Appropria-
tions I must vote against this legislation. The 
Founders were crystal clear about the impor-
tance of the power of the purse. Our duty to 
the American people is to ensure that we do 
not abdicate our responsibility to be effective 
stewards of taxpayer resources. 
My hope is that I can work with my col-
leagues here in the House and in the Senate 
to come to a stronger, bipartisan agreement 
on moving this bill forward in a manner that is 
consistent with the rules of this body and Con-
gress’ power of the purse.

CONGRATULATING LTC ERIC 
MARSHALL 
HON. AUMUA AMATA COLEMAN 
RADEWAGEN 
OF AMERICAN SAMOA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Lieutenant Colonel Eric 
Marshall on his retirement from the United 
States Army. LTC Marshall has had an illus-
trious career lasting over 20 years serving in 
the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, culminating 
as the Honolulu District’s Commander. 
In American Samoa, our men and women of 
the Armed Forces are very important to us. 
The people of our islands take great pride in 
being patriotic Americans and our people are 
known for a high rate of service in our military. 
In particular, our U.S. Army recruiting center 
ranks number one in the nation in enlistment 
rate. 
To that end I would like to recognize all the 
work LTC Marshall has done to lead through-
out his career in situations such as leading 
dive missions, having a key managing role in 
the Western Closure, commanding the B/1- 
48th infantry company, and imparting his 
knowledge on future leaders in the Army 
through his instruction and course direction in 
physics at West Point. 
He has an extensive list of military awards 
and decorations including the Bronze Star, 
Bronze DeFleury, and is currently nominated 
for the Silver DeFleury. He is a graduate of 
the prestigious U.S. Air Force Academy and 
received his Master’s Degree in nuclear engi-
neering from MIT. 
In congratulating this outstanding officer 
today, we also express our deep appreciation 
to all who serve, including the many in uniform 
from American Samoa serving with distinction 
all over the world. 
I thank Eric for his outstanding leadership 
and his commitment to our Soldiers, American 
Samoa, and our great Nation. Best wishes to 
him and his family as he departs Honolulu. I 
congratulate him on his retirement and the 
great future ahead. Again, I thank him for his 
service and his time dedicated to our beautiful 
island. 
God bless you on your journey. (Fa’amanuia 
le Atua i ou ala). Soifua.

HONORING MR. GENE WEEKS 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize Mr. Gene Weeks, a distin-
guished Superintendent from my district who 
is retiring this year after a career of service. 
Mr. Weeks is a dedicated educator of 36 
years, who served as a coach, athletic direc-
tor, principal, and assistant superintendent 
throughout his time at the Greene County 
Tech School District. He is retiring as the Su-
perintendent of Greene County Tech after 7 
years in the position. 
Mr. Weeks devoted his career to his stu-
dents and played an essential role in teaching 
and preparing the next generation to be lead-
ers and public servants. His commitment to 
the health, education, and success of his stu-
dents was invaluable to our community, and I 
am certain the First District is better because 
of service. 
CONGRATULATING DR. MARLA E. 
PE´ REZ-DAVIS 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 16, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my deep gratitude to Dr. Marla E. 
Pe´rez-Davis for her remarkable service as Di-
rector of the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration’s (NASA) John H. Glenn Re-
search Center, both the main campus at Lewis 
Field in Brook Park, Ohio and the Neil A. Arm-
strong Test Facility in Sandusky, Ohio—and to 
congratulate her on a well-deserved retire-
ment. 
Over her nearly forty-year career at NASA, 
Dr. Pe´rez-Davis nobly delivered for the Amer-
ican people in a variety of crucial roles, includ-
ing Deputy Director of the Research and Engi-
neering Directorate, Director of the Aero-
nautics Research Office, Chief of the Project 
Liaison and Integration Office, and Chief of the 
Electrochemistry Branch. 
Upon taking the helm as Director of the 
Glenn Research Center, Dr. Pe´rez-Davis went 
to work leading a team of more than 3,200 
dedicated professionals in the awe-inspiring 
mission 
of 
advancing 
humanity’s 
under-
standing of the cosmic wonders beyond. 
Dr. Pe´rez-Davis’ leadership has been instru-
mental in driving Glenn Research Center’s 
progress as a renowned hub for unrivaled in-
novation, technological excellence, economic 
development, and scientific discovery. Her 
commitment to expanding aerospace capabili-
ties; assuring cybersecurity and quantum com-
puting 
protections; 
and 
partnering 
with 
schools, students, and the wider community 
leave the Glenn Research Center in a strong 
position for the future ahead. 
It has been a sincere honor to work with Dr. 
Pe´rez-Davis—an esteemed leader who relent-
lessly focused on propelling the Glenn Re-
search Center—and the whole of NASA’s 
global enterprise—on its journey toward a new 
era of breathtaking enlightenment. 
I speak for the entire community of Northern 
Ohio in thanking Dr. Pe´rez-Davis and wishing 
her all the best in her next endeavor.
