Congress has the power to enact this legis-
lation pursuant to the following: 
The Congress has the power to enact this 
legislation pursuant to Article I, Section 8, 
Clauses 1, 4, and 18 of the U.S. Constitution, 
which provide as follows: 
The Congress shall have Power To lay and 
collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, 
to pay the Debts and provide for the common 
Defence and general Welfare of the United 
States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises 
shall be uniform throughout the United

Longstanding Supreme Court precedent 
recognizes Congress as having plenary power 
over immigration, giving it almost complete 
authority to decide whether aliens may 
enter or remain in the United States. 
In exercising its power over immigration, 
Congress can make laws concerning aliens 
that would be unconstitutional if applied to 
citizens. Demore v. Kirn, 538 U.S. 510, 522 
(2003)

MAKE IT IN AMERICA ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Make It in America Act.’’ I thank 
U.S. Senator DEBBIE STABENOW (D–MI) for 
sponsoring the companion legislation, which 
was passed recently by the Senate in the bi-
partisan ‘‘Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act’’ (H.R. 3684). 
Our ‘‘Make It in America Act’’ would prevent 
federal agencies from utilizing unnecessary 
waivers to get around ‘‘Buy American’’ require-
ments. Longstanding Congressional direction 
under the Buy American Act of 1933 (Public 
Law 72–428) requires the federal government 
to give preference to domestically produced 
goods and services. This ensures that tax-
payer dollars are spent in support of Amer-
ican-made products and American jobs. 
Despite this law, federal agencies routinely 
waive ‘‘Buy American’’ requirements without 
cause to purchase foreign-made products 
even when domestically made alternatives are 
readily available. This must end. 
The ‘‘Make It in America Act’’ would close 
loopholes in our nation’s ‘‘Buy American’’ laws 
and require that any waiver of the Buy Amer-
ican Act be publicly posted online with detailed 
justifications by the respective federal agency. 
Our bicameral legislation also supports 
President Biden’s Executive Order No. 14005, 
by providing Congressional authorization for 
the new Made in America Office within the 
White House’s Office of Management and 
Budget. This new office is charged with re-
viewing all waivers to the Buy American Act 
sought by federal agencies and ensuring com-
pliance with other ‘‘Buy American’’ laws. I 
strongly support President Biden’s executive 
order creating this much-needed central office 
dedicated to enforcing ‘‘Buy American’’ laws, 
and I thank him for his leadership on this crit-
ical issue. 
Congress must further strengthen our na-
tion’s ‘‘Buy American’’ laws to better support 
American manufacturing and competitiveness. 
The legislation I introduce today builds upon 
the ‘‘Make It In America’’ agenda I have advo-
cated for throughout my tenure in Congress 
and during my earlier service in State govern-
ment. When the federal government spends 
taxpayer dollars, those dollars should be spent 
on goods made by American workers. It’s that 
simple. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members 
to cosponsor my ‘‘Make It in America Act,’’ to 
support well-paying manufacturing jobs and 
help rebuild the American middle class. 
HONORING MOUNTAIRE FARMS 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Mountaire Farms and their enduring 
tradition of business excellence. 
The family-owned poultry farm and proc-
essing company is the fourth largest in the na-
tion, boasting a storied presence within North 
Carolina. Despite their scale, Mountaire has 
continued to cultivate a reputation for family 
values, business success, and giving back to 
local communities. 
Aligned with a 2019 expansion in Chatham 
County, Mountaire features newly opened 
plant operations in Siler City, NC, the largest 
city in the county, and a portion of the 13th 
District that I have the pleasure of rep-
resenting. The project represented a $170 mil-
lion investment, generating county tax revenue 
and creating over 1,000 jobs. 
Partnering with over 500 growers and em-
ploying over 1,500 workers in Siler City, 
Mountaire’s economic footprint is essential to 
the region. Statewide, Mountaire is an eco-
nomic powerhouse employing over 5,000 em-
ployees and processing over 840,000 chick-
ens on any given day, and is a major asset to 
North Carolina agriculture, the state’s largest 
industry. 
While continuing to increase production ca-
pacity and growing their business, Mountaire 
has remained focused on what really matters: 
the community they set up shop in. Through 
initiatives like Mountaire Cares, their annual 
Thanksgiving for Thousands drive, scholar-
ships, and other community service projects, 
they are deeply invested in improving the 
quality of life for Chatham County residents. 
Through it all, Mountaire embodies their 
core commitment ‘‘to be good stewards of all 
the assets God has entrusted to us.’’ This in-
cludes caring for employees, neighbors, cus-
tomers, and others by doing business the right 
way and by prioritizing people over mere prof-
its. 
Please join me in commending Mountaire 
Farms on a job well done.

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LT. 
COL. 
MATT 
URBAN 
VFW 
AND 
AMVETS POST 7275 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Lt. Col. Matt 
Urban VFW and AMVETS Post 7275 on the 
75th anniversary of its founding. 
The VFW and AMVETS Post, located in the 
Town of Lancaster, NY, is named after Matt 
Louis Urban, one of the most decorated Amer-
ican soldiers from WWII and a native of Buf-
falo, NY. Lieutenant Colonel Urban served in 
the United States Army from 1941–1946 and 
during his time in the military, saw combat in 
North Africa, Sicily, France, and Belgium. After 
being wounded in France, Urban and his bat-
talion carried on into Belgium where he was 
severely wounded by machine gun fire in 
Philippeville. Urban eventually made his way 
to Germany without the ability to speak from 
his previous injuries and medically retired from 
the Army in 1946. Returning to the United 
States, Lieutenant Colonel Urban settled down 
in Michigan, received the Medal of Honor in 
1979, and passed away in 1995. Some of 
Urban’s other honors include 2 Silver Stars, 7 
Purple Hearts, the Legion of Merit, and the 
Croix de Guerre from France. 
Post 7275 adopted Lt. Col. Matt Urban’s 
name in 2011 and today, it looks to keep its 
namesake’s legacy of selfless service alive 
through community involvement and outreach. 
Chicken and steak dinners, classic car shows, 
and holiday parties all populate the Post’s cal-
endar and fundraise for various causes and 
services. Additionally, the Post organizes sev-
eral veteran-related services and memorials 
for its members. During the Thanksgiving holi-
day, a food drive is put on by and for vet-
erans. For Memorial Day, Independence Day, 
and Veterans Day, the Post organizes cere-
monies to remember the fallen and honor its 
members’ sacrifices. Flag Day is especially 
significant for both the VFW and AMVETS as 
flags are placed at the graves of veterans and 
those killed in action at local cemeteries. The 
Post has also remained very active during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, helping members stay 
in contact with the local VA hospital for med-
ical services and keeping veterans informed 
about vaccination information. 
I thank the Lt. Col. Matt Urban VFW and 
AMVETS Post 7275 for its tireless commit-
ments to serving our local veterans and great-
er community, and I again congratulate the 
Post on its 75th anniversary.

HONORING KATHLEEN ANN

HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Kathleen Ann 
McCarty for her exceptional career dedicated 
to humanitarian service. 
Kathleen was born in Calexico, California, 
but soon after relocated with her family to 
Santa Rosa, where she attended Santa Rosa 
Junior College. Her service began when she 
took a year off from school to volunteer at the 
Chidamoyo Christian Hospital in Zimbabwe. 
Though never part of her original career path, 
her experiences inspired her to pursue a ca-
reer in nursing. In 1977, she graduated from 
the University of California, San Francisco and

went on to take a position as head nurse in a 
high-risk obstetrics unit in Sacramento while 
simultaneously obtaining her master’s degree 
in nursing in 1981. She returned to Zimbabwe 
after graduation where she lived for nearly 40 
years except for a few years in the nineties, 
when she returned to the U.S. to undergo can-
cer treatment. Following her recovery, she 
worked as a nurse at the Santa Rosa Memo-
rial Hospital for one year before returning to 
Zimbabwe. 
Under her leadership as the Clinical Officer 
at Chidamoyo Hospital, Kathleen was able to 
restart childhood immunization programs and 
initiated a program for routine antenatal tet-
anus immunization, which has nearly elimi-
nated newborn tetanus in Zimbabwe. In 2000, 
Kathleen began a program for antiviral treat-
ment for pregnant mothers in labor, which 
helped drop AIDS transmission in Zimbabwe 
to under 10 percent. Kathleen’s contributions 
have helped create 16 child vaccine clinics, 
seven HIV clinics, and have expanded the ca-
pacity of the hospital to 100 beds. Additionally, 
she created a scholarship program which sup-
ports the education of 250 young girls. 
Kathleen was undeterred by health com-
plications or by unpredictable events such as 
a fire that destroyed much of the hospital, a 
devastating outbreak of cholera, and even a 
break-in by local thieves demanding money. In 
September of 2020, Kathleen was diagnosed 
with a terminal malignancy and returned to the 
U.S. for treatment. She fought her illness with 
grace and never lost her sense of humor. 
Sadly, after 40 years of service, Kathleen 
passed away on May 26, 2021. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that 
Kathleen Ann McCarty’s achievements will 
leave a tremendous impact for generations to 
come. It is fitting and proper that we honor her 
here today.

HONORING JOHNNIE KERSHAW 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor Johnnie 
Kershaw, a retired volunteer firefighter and na-
tive of Hoke County, North Carolina. The sec-
ond oldest of nine children, Johnnie was born 
July 29, 1936, and moved to Brooklyn, New 
York, as a young man. There, he enrolled at 
Brooklyn 
Automotive 
School, 
where 
he 
learned transmission and auto body repair. In 
1966, he returned to Hoke County and opened 
Kershaw’s Body Shop, making him the first Af-
rican-American man in the county to own his 
own paint and body shop. 
Throughout his 30 years of service as a vol-
unteer firefighter, Johnnie received several 
awards, including the Outstanding Leadership 
Award, the Outstanding Fire Chief Award, and 
the Outstanding Safety Award. Now, at 85 
years old, Johnnie continues to serve as a 
model leader for the Hoke County community. 
I am proud to recognize his achievements 
today and to call him a constituent. 
THE PASSING OF SERGEI 
KOVALEV 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
as the Co-Chairman of the Commission on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (the Hel-
sinki Commission) to remember the great Rus-
sian human rights activist Sergei Kovalev and 
to include in the RECORD an opinion column 
by Vladimir Kara-Murza from Wednesday’s 
Washington Post. 
MOSCOW—‘‘Our opposition was not polit-
ical; it was moral incompatibility with the 
regime,’’ Sergei Kovalev, a leading figure in 
the Soviet dissident movement, explained in 
an interview for a documentary I made in 
the early 2000s. ‘‘At some point you realize 
that it is shameful to remain silent.’’ 
Last week, Kovalev died in his sleep at the 
age of 91. His funeral on Friday was attended 
by thousands of Muscovites who filed past 
his casket at the Sakharov Center, an insti-
tution named for his friend and mentor, 
Andrei Sakharov, and designated by Vladi-
mir 
Putin’s 
government 
as 
a 
‘‘foreign 
agent.’’ Several Western countries sent their 
diplomats to pay respects. No Russian gov-
ernment official attended. 
Perhaps it was better this way. I doubt 
Kovalev would have appreciated hypocritical 
gestures of condolence from a regime led by 
a KGB officer who has brought back many of 
the authoritarian practices Kovalev spent 
his life fighting. 
Like many in the Soviet dissident move-
ment, Kovalev joined the human rights 
struggle from the academic world. A success-
ful biophysicist and head of a laboratory sec-
tion at Moscow State University, he had a 
PhD and more than 60 research papers to his 
name. But he could not remain silent in the 
face of a resurgent totalitarianism of the 
Brezhnev era that saw both domestic repres-
sion and aggressive posturing abroad. For 
Kovalev, the defining moments were the 
show trial of writers Andrei Sinyavsky and 
Yuli Daniel and the Soviet invasion of 
Czechoslovakia, both in the second half of 
the 1960s. 
His activism brought his scientific career 
to an end, of course. From then on, Kovalev 
dedicated his life to documenting, publi-
cizing and confronting abuses committed by 
his government against his fellow citizens. A 
founding member of the Initiative Group for 
the Defense of Human Rights in the USSR— 
the first human rights group in the coun-
try—and the Moscow chapter of Amnesty 
International, Kovalev served as the editor 
of the Chronicle of Current Events, the 
samizdat news bulletin that reported on 
human rights violations throughout the So-
viet Union. During Kovalev’s subsequent 
trial on charges of ‘‘anti-Soviet agitation,’’ 
the KGB tried to prove the slanderous nature 
of the Chronicle’s reporting—but ended up 
confirming its accuracy. Not that it changed 
the outcome: Kovalev was sentenced to seven 
years of imprisonment followed by three 
years in internal exile. His trial was held be-
hind closed doors with a preselected ‘‘audi-
ence.’’ Sakharov tried, unsuccessfully, to 
enter the courtroom and ended up standing 
outside the door throughout the trial. At the 
very same time, in Oslo, Sakharov’s wife, 
Elena Bonner, was accepting his Nobel Peace 
Prize, which he dedicated to ‘‘all prisoners of 
conscience in the Soviet Union and in other 
Eastern 
European 
countries’’—including 
Kovalev, whom he mentioned by name. 
The collapse of communist regimes in 
Eastern Europe saw many former dissidents 
go into politics to help steer their countries 
toward democracy. Poland’s Lech Walesa 
and Czechoslovakia’s Vaclav Havel were only 
the best-known examples. In Russia, to its 
chagrin, this was more the exception than 
the norm—but Sergei Kovalev was among 
those exceptions. Four times he was elected 
to the Russian parliament. He was also Rus-
sia’s first human rights ombudsman, co- 
wrote the human rights clauses in the con-
stitution and served as Russia’s representa-
tive on the U.N. Human Rights Commission 
and the Parliamentary Assembly of the 
Council of Europe. 
Throughout it all, he stayed true to the 
principles that had defined his dissident pe-
riod. He sought to make politics moral and 
never compromised his conscience. With the 
start of Russia’s military campaign in 
Chechnya, he tried to use his position to pre-
vent 
bloodshed—including 
by 
personally 
leading negotiations that saved the lives of 
more than 1,500 hostages during a terrorist 
siege in the summer of 1995. But while Presi-
dent Boris Yeltsin had genuine respect for 
Kovalev, he chose advice from elsewhere. 
When it became clear that the war would not 
stop, Kovalev resigned his official positions 
and sent Yeltsin a sharply worded open let-
ter. The president responded personally, 
thanking Kovalev for his service and express-
ing sympathy for his motivation. This was a 
different Russia. 
Kovalev spent the last part of his life as he 
did the first: in opposition to a regime in-
creasingly intolerant of domestic dissent and 
increasingly aggressive toward others. While 
Russia still had a real parliament, Kovalev 
remained a member—voting against Putin’s 
confirmation as prime minister in 1999 and 
warning of a coming ‘‘authoritarian police 
state led by . . . the well-preserved Soviet 
security services’’ in early 2000. That was a 
time when many in Russia and in the West 
were still harboring illusions about Putin. 
When legal opposition politics became all 
but impossible, Kovalev returned to being 
what he knew best, a dissident. His last pub-
lic appearance, earlier this year, was at a 
virtual event commemorating Sakharov’s 
centennial. 
Kovalev described himself as an idealist— 
an indispensable quality in a seemingly 
hopeless struggle against a ruthless authori-
tarian 
system. 
The 
main 
lesson 
from 
Kovalev and his fellow dissidents was that 
one can choose not to remain silent even in 
the most difficult circumstances. And that, 
in the end, the struggle might not be as 
hopeless as it seems.’’

HONORING FRED A. MANUELE 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate my con-
stituent, Fred A. Manuele from Arlington 
Heights, for receiving the inaugural Prevention 
through Design (PtD) Award. Presented by the 
National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health (NIOSH), the American Society of 
Safety Professionals (ASSP), and the National 
Safety Council (NSC), this award recognizes 
individuals, teams, businesses, or other orga-
nizations that have improved worker safety 
and health by designing-out hazards or con-
tributing to the body of knowledge that en-
ables PtD solutions. 
Fred Manuele is a longtime occupational 
safety and health expert and a pioneer in the 
prevention through design field. ASSP repub-
lished many of his influential professional pa-
pers in a book titled, Fred Manuele on Safety 
Management: A Collection from Professional 
Safety. Fred also published numerous occupa-
tional safety and health textbooks that always 
included the need for designing-out workplace 
hazards and the methods to do so. 
In 1995, Manuele led a focused 10-year 
NSC initiative, the Institute for Safety Through 
Design, which culminated in a textbook he co- 
authored titled, Safety through Design. In 
2007, inspired by Fred’s work, NIOSH and nu-
merous partners launched a National Preven-
tion through Design Initiative. Manuele volun-
teered to lead the effort to develop and ap-
prove a broad, universal voluntary consensus 
PtD standard aligned with international PtD 
activities, practices, and standards. 
PtD aims to prevent or reduce occupational 
injuries, illnesses, and fatalities through the in-
clusion of prevention considerations in all de-
signs that impact workers. This includes the 
design, redesign and retrofit of new and exist-
ing work premises, structures, tools, facilities, 
equipment, machinery, products, substances, 
work processes, and the organization of work. 
In addition to reducing the risk of serious in-
jury and illness, significant cost savings are 
often associated with hazard elimination and 
the application of engineering controls to mini-
mize risks. 
Manuele has received many honors and 
awards for his accomplishments. He is an 
ASSP Fellow and a recipient of the NSC’s 
Distinguished Service to Safety Award. He is 
a former board member of ASSP, NSC, and 
the Board of Certified Safety Professionals, 
where he also served as president and re-
ceived a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2013. 
In 2015, the University of Central Missouri pre-
sented him with its Distinguished Service 
Award. In 2016, Manuele received the ASSP 
President’s Award for his dedication to ad-
vancing the practice of safety. 
I am pleased to congratulate Fred for his 
outstanding foresight, wisdom, tireless effort, 
and major accomplishments in preventing 
harm to workers by helping organizations 
avoid and prevent hazards. This award is well- 
deserved.

COMMEMORATING 86TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SOCIAL SECURITY ACT 
OF 1935 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate the 86th anniversary of the 
passage of the landmark Social Security Act 
of 1935, the most famous of the New Deal 
measures and perhaps the most beneficial 
and consequential government program in 
American history. 
On August 14, 1935, President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt signed into law the Social 
Security Act of 1935 and made good on the 
Democratic Party’s commitment to provide in-
come security to Americans in their old age. 
Social Security has transformed what it 
means to grow old in this country. 
For 86 years, Social Security has rep-
resented a bedrock promise to the American 
people: that a lifetime of work will be rewarded 
with the peace of mind, certainty, and sense 
of security of a stable retirement. 
As we celebrate the 86th anniversary of the 
Social Security Act of 1935, we should reflect 
also on the real-life transformative impact 
America’s most successful program continues 
to have on millions of Americans each year. 
Social Security has been a stable and se-
cure source of income for millions of seniors 
and families, many of whom desperately need 
it, over these last more than seven decades. 
In the 18th Congressional District of Texas, 
Social Security is the primary economic lifeline 
for more than 91,000 seniors and disabled 
persons. Social Security’s economic impact 
also goes well beyond the seniors and families 
receiving benefits. 
It also benefits state economies and local 
businesses all across the country. 
In the 18th Congressional District of Texas, 
Social Security recipients inject more than $97 
million into the local economy annually; nation-
wide, this figure is $775 billion. 
When more than 58 million Americans use 
the purchasing power of those benefits, they 
are supporting businesses with dollars they 
would not have without Social Security. 
Madam Speaker, far too often overlooked is 
the seismic impact that Social Security has 
had in shaping our national economy and the 
structure of life chances for hundreds of mil-
lions of Americans through the years. 
Before Social Security, children were wholly 
responsible for the care and support of aging 
parents, which meant they were tethered to 
the towns, villages, communities, and rural 
areas where they grew up and their parents 
resided. 
Madam Speaker, before passage of the So-
cial Security Act, it was very rare for children 
to leave their hometown to attend college in a 
city far away and after graduating move to an-
other place far away to start a career, take a 
job, or begin a business. 
The Social Security Act of 1935 changed 
that, not only by providing financial support to 
aging parents but by providing their children 
the opportunity to chase their dreams, realize 
their full potential, and use their skills and tal-
ents to make America better by providing the 
peace of mind that their beloved parents 
would not be financially destitute in their gold-
en years. 
Those children would go on to invent new 
industries creating millions of good jobs, dis-
cover life-saving vaccines, design and build 
systems that won the Cold War and put a man 
on the Moon and brought him back to Earth, 
and vastly broadened the frontiers of knowl-
edge. 
This is also the legacy of Social Security, 
the visionary social program of FDR’s New 
Deal that helped make America the world’s 
leading superpower. 
It is shameful that there are congressional 
Republicans who continue to promote various 
plans to privatize or partially privatize Social 
Security—plans that would rob seniors of the 
economic security they count on. 
Over the last 86 years, House Democrats 
have protected and strengthened Social Secu-
rity; and now and in the future, House Demo-
crats will always act to preserve Social Secu-
rity and safeguard the rights of our nation’s 
seniors and will extend similar protection to 
America’s children by making permanent the 
Child Tax Credit, what in future years will 
come to be known as ‘‘Social Security for Chil-
dren.’’ 
And as we look to the future, we can cele-
brate that what was put in place in 1935 with 
the Social Security Act of 1935 has given us 
the foundation for a secure and prosperous fu-
ture for all Americans.

AMERICAN SUFFRAGIST MARKER 
DEDICATION, AUGUST 26, 2021 
HON. DONALD S. BEYER, JR. 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the American Suffragist Marker Dedi-
cation occurring on August 26, 2021. 
In November 1917, on the sidewalks outside 
the White House, women stood on the pave-
ment in silence. They stood in rain and shine 
and cold, brandishing signs demanding pas-
sage of the 19th Amendment to the United 
States Constitution. With passage, would 
come the right to vote for most American 
women. 
In mid-November 1917, 32 suffragists were 
arrested in front of the White House. Many 
were past the age of 60. The charge was ‘‘Ob-
structing Traffic.’’ The ‘‘Silent Sentinels’’ were 
ordered to be imprisoned at the District of Co-
lumbia (Occoquan) Workhouse in Lorton, Vir-
ginia.

August 20, 2021 
Along with unwashed bedding, putrid food 
and fetid water, the women were subjected to 
undue hardships and torture, resulting in the 
infamous November 14, 1917 ‘‘Night of Ter-
ror.’’ A number of women prisoners were 
threatened, chained to their cells, beaten and 
hurled against walls, floors and metal fixtures. 
One woman suffered a heart attack and was 
denied prompt medical attention. A few days 
later, violent force feedings began for suffra-
gists who had initiated a hunger strike in retal-
iation against the brutality. 
Bruised, ill and broken, the suffragist pris-
oners were brought to Alexandria, Virginia on 
November 27, 1917, for a hearing at the 
United States District Court for the Eastern 
District of Virginia. Judge Edmund Waddill, Jr., 
agreeing the women’s treatment had been un-
duly harsh, ordered the release of the suffra-
gists from Occoquan. Freed from the brutality 
of Occoquan, many resumed their cause for 
enfranchisement. 
The 19th Amendment was ratified August 
18, 1920. Certification of the Amendment by 
U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby oc-
curred a few days later, on August 26, 1920. 
August 26 is now known as Women’s Equality 
Day. 
This Women’s Equality Day, August 26, 
2021, Alexandria Mayor Justin Wilson, the Of-
fice of Historic Alexandria and Alexandria 
Celebrates Women will dedicate an historic 
marker to honor the women who bravely en-
dured imprisonment and torture in their efforts 
to gain equality at the ballot box and to recog-
nize the site of the landmark hearing that took 
place in Alexandria.

HONORING JANICE LANE SCHROE-
DER AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a tireless advocate, role model, 
leader, and the CEO of Children & Families of 
Iowa Janice Lane Schroeder as Iowan of the 
Week. 
Janice is a leader in Iowa’s statewide efforts 
to serve families harmed by substance abuse, 
mental health crises, domestic abuse, and 
other life circumstances. After starting her ca-
reer working with chemically dependent adults, 
she now heads the hardworking team at Chil-
dren & Families of Iowa. 
This nonprofit is one of the top family serv-
ices organizations in our state. Through its 
varied programs and services, the organiza-
tion helps everyone from children who need a 
safe home to adults learning to cope with trau-
ma. Children & Families of Iowa goes beyond 
offering solutions for families and children in 
crisis; the organization offers hope when it 
may seem like there is none. They offer a 
chance to build better futures and provide an 
opportunity to change lives. 
The saying the apple doesn’t fall far from 
the tree applies to Janice and her family. She 
learned through her own family’s service to 
others, and that inspired her to become the 
leader and advocate she is today. Her father, 
Rev. Hardest Lane, founded the nonprofit H.E. 
Lane Center for Positive Change to assist 
men reentering the community from incarcer-
ation. Her mother, Janice O. Lane, a mis-
sionary and National Merit Scholarship Corp. 
administrator, led work establishing a family 
reunification center so women could be visited 
by their children. 
With everything she’s already accomplished 
in her career, Janice still has a few more 
projects on her bucket list. Some of those 
projects include: developing a multicultural, 
clinical team specializing in child welfare in 
marginalized communities, further establishing 
existing initiatives in early childhood education, 
and parent-child educational opportunities; de-
veloping more accessible mental health care 
treatments for survivors of domestic abuse; 
and improving employment education for 
youths. 
It is Janice’s passion for the work that she 
does that makes her such an effective leader 
and community advocate, and it is people like 
her who make Iowa such a great place. I will 
continue to fight in Congress to support orga-
nizations like Children & Families of Iowa and 
amplify the continued efforts of advocates like 
Janice. It is my pleasure to honor Janice Lane 
Schroeder as Iowan of the Week.

HONORING THE NORTHWEST INDI-
ANA BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 
HALL OF FAME CLASS OF 2021 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I commend 
several remarkable leaders who have been 
honored as the Northwest Indiana Business 
and Industry Hall of Fame Class of 2021. This 
year’s inductees include Maria and Oscar Mar-
tinez, Pat Popa, Peter Nau, and the Ziese 
Family. Centier Bank was also presented the 
Enterprise of the Year Award. 
Maria and Oscar Martinez are the proud 
owners of Tortillas Nuevo Leon, a family- 
owned company in Hammond, which sells tor-
tilla products to grocers and restaurants. Maria 
and Oscar were both born and raised in 
Nuevo Leon, Mexico. After coming to East 
Chicago in 1957, Oscar spent 14 years mak-
ing tortillas in the tortilla factory before starting 
Tortillas Nuevo Leon with Maria in 1975, mak-
ing only tortillas. In 1990, the family tradition 
continued when their two sons, Jesus and 
Jaime, and their daughter, Olga, joined the 
company and helped expand the product line 
and distribution networks. Oscar retired in 
2005 and Maria followed in 2007, leaving their 
children to run the business. Jesus became 
president, Jaime is vice president, and Olga is 
the office manager. Tortillas Nuevo Leon prod-
ucts can be found in twenty-eight states and 
Canada. 
Pat Popa is the owner of Popa Heating and 
Cooling, an HVAC company located in High-
land. Popa Heating and Cooling was originally 
founded in 1968 by Pat’s husband, Nick Popa. 
Their initial focus was installing heating and 
cooling systems in new home construction, but 
growth and success have enabled the com-
pany to expand their services to include exist-
ing residential heating and cooling in the 
Northwest Indiana area. Now, they replace old 
systems, offer new installations for existing 
homes, and provide system services, repairs, 
and equipment. Pat has been instrumental in 
organizing projects in downtown Highland to 
help increase traffic for the retail business dis-
trict and improve the quality of life for its resi-
dents. In addition to her successful business, 
Pat gives much of her time and efforts to the 
Northwest Indiana community. In 2003, Pat 
created ‘‘Downtown Ducks,’’ a public art 
project that earned her the Governor’s Award 
for Volunteerism from then-Governor Joseph 
Kernan. She has also been recognized by 
South Shore Arts with a Lifetime Distinguished 
Service Membership for developing a scholar-
ship program for art students in Lake, Porter 
and LaPorte Counties through ‘‘The County 
Seats’’ public art project. 
Peter Nau is the president of Hammond Ma-
chine Works, a North American supplier of 
high-quality precision machining, metal fab-
rication, assembly and finishing of parts to the 
OEM market. Hammond Machine Works, 
which serves the rail car industry, has always 
been a family business. The business began 
in 1908 and was owned by Charles Nicholas 
Nau. Charles’ son, Mike Nau, purchased the 
business in 1962 from Henry Kuehl and grew 
the company’s capabilities and involvement in 
the community. Peter first started working with 
the company in 1979, and in 1992 he pur-
chased the business from his father and took 
over as President. Under Peter’s leadership, 
Hammond Machine Works has continued to 
succeed and expand. In 2015, the company 
invested $4 million in new equipment at its 
production facility in Dallas, Texas. Hammond 
Machine Works was honored with the Premier 
Supplier Award from one of the major car 
builders in Texas in addition to earning a col-
laboration award for working with a company 
to develop a product. For his contributions to 
charitable endeavors throughout Northwest In-
diana, Peter was named Person of the Year 
by the Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce in 
2016. Peter and his wife, Debbie, have three 
sons, Peter, Travis, and Michael, all of whom 
play a role in Hammond Machine Works. 
The Ziese Family owns and operates Ziese 
& Sons Excavating, Inc., a demolition and ex-
cavating company based in Crown Point. 
Ziese & Sons was established in the early 
1970s by the late Kenneth D. and Jean Ziese. 
The small business started with just mom, 
dad, two sons, Kenneth and Zach, and a 
dump truck. The company continued to grow 
and expand and joined the operating engi-
neers, becoming unionized in 1991. This 
made it easier to secure commercial jobs, in-
surance, and other benefits. Ziese & Sons Ex-
cavating currently has 47 employees, which 
includes family members from the third gen-
eration. Zach Ziese serves as the president, 
Ken Ziese as vice president, and Jean Ziese 
is the company’s secretary. A couple of note-
worthy projects completed by Ziese & Sons 
Excavating include the Strack & Van Til plaza 
in Crown Point and the new Franciscan hos-
pital. 
The recipient of the Enterprise of the Year 
Award is Centier Bank, Indiana’s largest pri-

Bank of Whiting, Centier Bank was founded by 
Henry Schrage in 1895 after he opened a 
bank inside of his general store. Since 1895, 
the Schrage family has built a legacy of suc-
cess that extends throughout the communities

Madam Speaker, I ask you and my distin-
guished colleagues to join me in commending 
these dedicated leaders and organizations 
upon their induction into the Northwest Indiana 
Business and Industry Hall of Fame. They are 
truly deserving of this honor, and for their ex-
ceptional leadership and commitment to the 
region and beyond, each of them is worthy of 
the highest praise.

HONORING SPECIAL EVENT 
SERVICES 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the American spirit of determination, 
resilience, and steady faith as embodied by 
Special Event Services (SES), a full service 
technical production company headquartered 
in Mocksville, North Carolina. 
Keeping time with the music industry, it 
came as no surprise to founding partners Jim 
Brammer and Jeff Cranfill that earning a living 
from their craft would require infectious pas-
sion and a commitment to the next show, re-
gardless of the size of the crowd. From their 
opening act as a 1986 garage start-up, the 
duo steadily grew SES into a major industry 
player, eventually providing their live-event 
production services in audio, lighting, video, 
and rigging to the likes of 18 Grammy winners 
and many more. 
SES’ clientele ranges from iconic legends of 
decades past, like Hootie and the Blowfish 
and Lynyrd Skynyrd, to contemporary chart- 
toppers such as Luke Combs, Ed Sheeran, 
and The Avett Brothers. Also aligned with the 
heart of the company’s business is their desire 
to amplify Christian voices, and SES has pro-
vided services to Franklin Graham, Joyce 
Meyer, and Joel Osteen, among others. 
Such 
success, 
however, 
hasn’t 
been 
achieved without its own share of challenges. 
When concerts, shows, and national tours 
came screeching to a halt at the onset of 
2020’s COVID–19 pandemic, SES too was 
forced to take a hiatus from their regular way 
of doing business. Due to lockdown and stay- 
at-home orders, the company pivoted instead 
to 
producing 
intimate 
online 
sessions 
streamed for fans to view from their homes. 
In October of 2020—despite a grim outlook 
for the live event and performance industry as 
they knew it—SES celebrated the grand open-
ing of their recently completed new base of 
operations, planting them in the historic town 
of Mocksville, the heart of Davie County. Fast- 
forward to the summer of 2021, and business 
is rapidly picking up tempo, proving our econ-
omy is primed to rebound to its former 
heights. One higher profile example of recent 
note, the Carolina Country Music Festival, fea-
tured a star-studded lineup and over 30,000 
fans in attendance for the multi-day festival. 
Being tapped to lead the production was SES, 
a decision that’s indicative of the industry’s 
confidence in the company and its work. 
Though 2020 was a year of uncertainty, the 
company set their sights ahead and continued 
working towards the reemergence of their core 
business: live-event production services. With 
tours, festivals, performances, and gatherings 
back in full swing, it’s abundantly clear that a 
central belief of SES that ‘‘Together we are 
greater than the sum of our parts’’ is ringing 
loud and true. 
Please join me in applauding Special Event 
Services for their perseverance through adver-
sity as they faithfully live out their work’s mis-
sion, one show at a time.

HONORING LT. GEN. JOHN F. 
GONGE 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 20, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Lieutenant General John F. 
Gonge for his long and distinguished military 
career as well as the establishment of the 
Gonge Innovation Center at Travis Air Force 
Base’s Phoenix Spark Lab. Lt. Gen. Gonge 
was born in 1921, in Ansley, Neb., where he 
graduated from Ansley High School in 1938 
before his desire to serve led him to enter ac-
tive military service as an aviation cadet. He 
attended the U.S. Army Air Corps Flying 
School at Lubbock Army Air Field, Texas, 
where he received his pilot wings and com-
mission as a second lieutenant in December 
1943. During World War II, he flew the 
‘‘Hump’’ in the China-Burma-India campaigns 
with the Army Air Corps Air Transport Com-
mand, ensuring crucial resources could be 
transported 
through 
the 
treacherous 
Himalayas to American allies. 
A career transport pilot, General Gonge has 
filled innumerable roles during his career, re-
maining with airlift forces through Air Training 
Command, Military Air Transport Service, and 
Military Airlift Command. At each stop along 
the way he has imparted his experience and 
wisdom to many others who seek to serve 
their country. In July 1969 he came to Travis 
Air Force Base as vice commander of the 60th 
Military Airlift Wing before he was assigned as 
commander of the 63d Military Airlift Wing at 
Norton Air Force Base, Calif., in February 
1970. Subsequently, General Gonge com-
manded the 22d Air Force at Travis Air Force 
Base from August 1972 to August 1975, when 
he became vice commander of the Military Air-
lift Command. 
General Gonge is a command pilot with 
more than 13,000 flying hours. His military 
decorations and awards include the Distin-
guished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Distin-
guished Flying Cross, Meritorious Service 
Medal, Air Medal, Air Force Commendation 
Medal with oak leaf cluster, Army Commenda-
tion Medal, and the Distinguished Unit Citation 
Emblem. These recognitions and his pro-
motion to the grade of lieutenant general in 
September, 1975 make it clear that General 
Gonge’s legacy will continue to guide and in-
spire generations to come. On behalf of the 
people of California’s 3rd Congressional Dis-
trict, I offer my sincere gratitude for his many 
decades of dedicated service.
