Your purposes. When it is difficult to 
see the path ahead, give them the wis-
dom to trust the unfolding of Your 
powerful providence. Empower them to

they seek to live for Your glory. 
Lord, unite them to bear the burdens 
which are laid upon them during these 
challenging days. As they remember 
their accountability to You, inspire 
them to be good stewards of Your 
bounty. And, Lord, bless Ukraine. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

INFANT FORMULA SHORTAGE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the 
hardest job in America during the pan-
demic certainly fell on the shoulders of 
our healthcare heroes. We owe a great 
debt of gratitude to the sacrifice and 
integrity they showed during this chal-
lenge. 
But I want to add another category 
and that would be the category of par-
ents, particularly of newborn infants 
during the pandemic. They have dealt 
with 
school 
closures 
and 
COVID 
lockdowns, rising prices at the check-
out counter, and for parents with kids 
under the age of 5, the wait for COVID 
vaccine has been excruciating. 
Now parents throughout the country 
are 
facing 
another 
burden—of 
all 
things—the availability and cost of in-
fant formula. Since the beginning of 
this year, the supply of infant formula 
in America has been reduced by nearly 
half—half. The obvious question is, 
Why? 
In February, the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration discovered that Abbott’s 
Michigan 
factory, 
which 
produces 
Similac, a well-known infant formula 
to many parents, may have been the 
source of a bacteria outbreak. That 
outbreak sent four infants to the hos-
pital. Tragically, it claimed the lives of 
two. As a result, the factory in Michi-
gan was shut down. 
That shutdown and larger supply 
chain issues has caused a shortage and 
caused panic among many families. At 
this very moment, parents are fran-
tically scouring the internet for for-
mula, driving for hours from store to 
store, and paying obscene prices to 
shady sellers exploiting this desperate 
situation. 
Some of the parents in Illinois have 
written to me. One of them is Jennifer 
Sendeski from Deer Park, IL. Eight 
months ago, she gave birth to her son. 
In her words, it was a moment of 
‘‘sheer joy, love and excitement.’’ Soon 
after she gave birth, Jennifer joined 
millions 
of 
other 
women 
in 
supplementing her son’s diet with for-
mula. 
Jennifer wrote to me that ‘‘in the 
last several months we have been fight-
ing an uphill battle to find formula . . . 
what would have once cost . . . $13 for 
12 [ounce] can of powdered formula now 
sells for $40 . . . if you can find it on 
the shelves.’’ 
Jennifer describes her struggle to 
find that formula as a ‘‘nightmare.’’ 
She is not alone. Another mother 
named Jennifer, who lives in Lake Zu-
rich, IL, said the formula shortage is 
‘‘becoming dire,’’ in her words.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2638 
May 24, 2022 
Sadly, these moms are right. The 
shortage is dire. That is why I am 
grateful that the President has sprung 
into action trying to help these parents 
and families. Two days ago, the admin-
istration completed its first shipment 
of more than 75,000 pounds of imported 
formula as part of Operation Fly For-
mula, enough for more than half a mil-
lion bottles. The second shipment is ex-
pected in a few days. 
As these shipments reach American 
shores, President Biden has also in-
voked the Defense Production Act, an 
authority he has under the law to ramp 
up domestic production. This could 
help to eliminate supply chain bottle-
necks and compel manufacturers to 
prioritize the production of infant for-
mula. It is hard to think of anything 
that would be a higher priority. 
Both of these steps are crucial, but in 
the meantime, if you are a parent 
struggling to find formula, the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
has 
a 
website 
you 
should 
visit, 
HHS.gov/formula. That is HHS.gov/for-
mula. 
It 
identifies 
companies 
and 
healthcare providers, food banks, and 
other resources that have supplies 
available. 
Let 
me 
say 
it 
again: 
HHS.gov/formula. 
Additionally, last week, President 
Biden signed the Access to Baby For-
mula Act into law. It allows parents to 
purchase more infant formula through 
WIC, which provides nutritional sup-
port for low-income families, and I be-
lieve I read that half the babies in 
America count on WIC. 
Finally, the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration is working to maximize for-
mula production as well—in particular, 
the production of specialized formulas, 
like hypoallergenic formula, for in-
fants with specific health needs. 
The FDA also has entered into an 
agreement with Abbott to get its 
Michigan factory back in business. 
That is the largest infant formula fac-
tory in the country. We need to get it 
reopened safely and quickly. As long as 
the company meets critical safety 
standards, we want them in produc-
tion. 
But let’s be clear: This disastrous sit-
uation could have been averted if the 
FDA was not chronically understaffed 
and underfunded. At the time Abbott’s 
factory was shut down, try to guess 
how many Federal employees had the 
responsibility for the oversight of this 
life-and-death industry. The answer: 
nine. Nine people within FDA were re-
sponsible for the oversight of infant 
formula, nine workers monitoring a 
$3.5 billion industry that directly im-
pacts millions of American families. 
These workers are spread way too 
thin, and here is why that is a problem: 
When a safety issue arises, it can take 
months for the FDA to launch an in-
vestigation. That is exactly what hap-
pened at Abbott’s plant in Michigan. 
The FDA received a complaint about 
that factory’s production last October, 
but they didn’t physically inspect the 
plant until January of this year. 
FDA does essential work with lim-
ited resources, but it cannot serve the 
needs of the American consumers and 
families on a thin budget. If we want to 
truly protect the safety and well-being 
of families and kids, we need to step up 
in Congress. The House of Representa-
tives did it last week. House law-
makers passed Congresswoman ROSA 
DELAURO’s legislation to provide $28 
million in additional funding to help 
the FDA resolve the formula shortage 
and to prevent the next one. 
This legislation is a no-brainer from 
my point of view, and that is why it is 
puzzling that 190 Republican Congress 
men and women voted against it. They 
voted against giving money to the FDA 
to get the infant formula back safely 
into the homes of American families 
and to prevent any healthcare and safe-
ty issue in the future, and 190 Repub-
licans said: No, I don’t want to spend 
that money. That is right, the party 
that often claims to be so pro-family 
voted against legislation to help par-
ents feed their families, feed their ba-
bies, and provide parents with the 
peace of mind that their formula is 
safe. 
Now, I am sure my Republican col-
leagues will keep coming to the floor 
this week to express outrage over the 
infant formula shortage, but as you lis-
ten to what they say, also watch how 
they vote. If they are serious about 
protecting kids and families, it is time 
to vote that way. Congresswoman 
DELAURO’s legislation puts us on the 
right path. I hope the Senate joins the 
House in passing it soon. 
While we are at it, let’s also recog-
nize the challenges that were facing 
working families long before the for-
mula shortage and even before the pan-
demic. 
Congress has waited far too long to 
provide the support working families 
need to thrive. So let’s extend the en-
hanced child tax credit. Let’s provide 
paid 
parental 
leave. 
Let’s 
offer 
postpartum health coverage to all new 
moms. Let’s help parents afford the 
cost of high-quality education. I think 
those measures are critical, and they 
are pro-family. 
We have the power to make America 
the best place in the world to raise a 
family. We are not quite there. Instead 
of denying families the freedom to 
choose when and how to raise a child, 
I have a different proposal for my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle: Let’s 
invest in the health and potential of 
every family in America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, on 
the campaign trail, Candidate Biden 
made some big promises for America’s 
economic recovery. His campaign pub-
lished ‘‘the Biden Plan to revitalize 
Main Street and invest in small busi-
nesses’’ and another ‘‘to give America’s 
working families the tools, choices, 
and freedom they need to build back 
better.’’ So just how have the working 
families and small businesses fared 
with President Biden and the Demo-
cratic Party calling the shots? Sixty- 
nine percent of Americans say our 
economy right now is bad. Even more— 
77 percent—say they are pessimistic 
about costs rising even more in the 
coming months. Just last month, one 
longstanding 
measure 
of 
optimism 
among small business owners reached 
its lowest level on record. 
Month after month, the historic high 
inflation Democrats helped unleash 
with runaway spending last spring is 
taking its toll on Americans’ hope for 
the future, but more immediately, it is 
taking its toll on their wallets. More 
than a third of Americans say they are 
having difficulty paying for usual 
household expenses. 
Just last month, the price of a gallon 
of milk was 16 percent higher than the 
year before. Gas prices are scraping the 
stratosphere. In Kentucky, the average 
price for a gallon of regular reached an 
alltime high 2 weeks ago. Today, it is 
20 cents higher than that. 
In Lexington, one resident who drives 
a rideshare put it this way: 
I’m not trying to be a billionaire, I’m just 
trying to pay some bills. 
She is facing more pain at the pump, 
and so are the folks paying even more 
to fill up trucks, tractors, or delivery 
vans with diesel. 
The costs behind small business own-
ers’ headaches are behind consumers’ 
hardship. 
But somehow, as our Nation reaps 
the effects of their first year of one- 
party control, Washington Democrats 
are operating as if the exact opposite 
conditions were afoot. After their 
spending bonanza helped kick off his-
toric inflation, they want to pile on the 
biggest tax hikes in history. After 
their radical day 1 climate agenda 
hammered the most affordable forms of 
American energy, they want to double 
down on far-left fantasies. 
As the Biden administration passed 
its 100th day in office, I urged the 
President to ‘‘recommit to solving our 
nation’s actual problems.’’ Well, here 
we are, approaching his administra-
tion’s 500th day in office. By now, 
America’s working families have fig-
ured out for themselves that the so- 
called ‘‘Biden Plan’’ for them is just a 
fast track to historic hardships. 
ELECTION LAWS 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, 5 months ago, Demo-
crats in the media were saying the sky 
was falling because of some States’ 
mainstream 
voting 
laws. 
Georgia 
passed a voting law that was more open

than the rules on the books in blue 
States like New York and Delaware. 
Texas passed a law that switched off 
some one-time COVID exceptions, like 
keeping polls open in the middle of the 
night. 
These mainstream laws brought a 
torrent—a torrent—of hysteria from 
the far left, from corporate America, 
Hollywood, and the corporate media 
rushed to condemn laws they hadn’t 
even read. It was almost completely 
untethered from reality. One poll a few 
months back found that less than half 
of 1 percent of Americans said voting 
laws were the country’s most impor-
tant problem. More Americans actually 
believe current voting laws are too lax 
than believe they are too restrictive. 
But the far left bubble became fix-
ated—fixated—on this nonissue. 
The manufactured outrage just kept 
coming. At the peak of the crescendo a 
few months back, 48 of 50 Senate Demo-
crats voted to break this institution— 
to 
break 
this 
institution—to 
ram 
through a 3-year-old voting takeover 
bill on a partisan basis. That is how 
close we came. 
Now, fortunately, a bipartisan major-
ity saved the Senate as an institution, 
and now, we are seeing the hard evi-
dence that, as we all knew, the 
hysteria was never based on fact to 
begin with. 
Georgia’s primary election day is 
today. But we already know a lot, 
thanks to early voting figures. 
And here was a Washington Post 
headline a few days ago, ‘‘Voting is 
surging in Georgia despite controver-
sial new election law.’’ 
The story goes on: 
[R]ecord-breaking turnout is undercutting 
predictions that the Georgia Election Integ-
rity Act . . . would lead to a falloff in voting. 
By the end of Friday, the final day of early 
in-person voting, nearly 800,000 Georgians 
had cast ballots—more than three times— 
three times the number in 2018, and— 
Listen to this— 
higher even than in 2020, a presidential year. 
Turnout is up despite the fact that 
fewer Georgians are availing them-
selves of the State’s no-excuse mail-in 
voting. Georgians are getting back to 
in-person 
voting, 
a 
return 
to 
prepandemic norms, and doing so in 
huge, huge numbers. 
The reporter quoted one 70-year-old 
Black voter who was stunned by the 
easiness of the voting process after all 
the 
disinformation 
that 
had 
been 
thrown around. 
Here is what she said: 
I had heard that they were going to try to 
deter us in any way possible . . . [so] [t]o go 
in there and vote as easily as I did . . . I was 
really thrown back. 
Shame—shame—on 
the 
Democrats 
who pushed the Big Lie that a grand 
scheme was afoot to prevent millions 
of Americans from voting. It was never 
true. It was just to push their pre-
existing 
policy 
agenda. 
The 
fake 
hysteria was just a pretext to push a 
sweeping national takeover of election 
laws that Democrats had already had 
on the shelf for a number of years. 
Now the rhetoric is proving false 
right before our eyes. These common-
sense Republican laws appear to be 
achieving just what the American peo-
ple want. The American people want to 
make it easier to vote and harder to 
cheat. 
This whole episode proves exactly 
why our democracy still needs its cool-
ing saucer. This is exactly the reason 
why the U.S. Senate exists, so that one 
party cannot lose its head to a short- 
term fever and upend massive Federal 
laws on a partisan basis under false 
pretexts. 
Thank goodness—thank goodness—a 
bipartisan majority stopped Democrats 
from destroying the Senate over this 
fake issue a few months back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has 
become clear over the last few months 
that too much of the Republican Party 
has been taken over by MAGA Repub-
licans, who are now dominating the 
party and Republicans in the Senate, 
moving the party away from things it 
has often stood for in the pest. 
The 
contrast 
has 
become 
clear: 
Democrats, for instance, want to codify 
a woman’s freedom to make decisions 
about her own body into Federal law, 
but MAGA Republicans want to take 
away women’s rights by pushing na-
tional abortion bans, jailing women 
and doctors for carrying out abortions, 
and even pushing bans with no excep-
tion for rape or incest. 
In the wake of the Buffalo shooting, 
MAGA Republicans continue embrac-
ing unhinged conspiracy theories like 
the ‘‘great replacement,’’ which has 
been 
a 
rallying 
cry 
for 
ultranationalists and White suprema-
cists in Europe for years. 
And all year long, while Democrats 
have been pushing solutions that will 
lower costs, MAGA Republicans and 
the chair of the Republican campaign 
arm openly support raising taxes on 
the poor and working families, while 
cheering on inflation as a ‘‘gold mine.’’ 
And those were Senator SCOTT’s words, 
not mine. He called inflation a gold 
mine. Imagine. 
MAGA 
Republicans 
are 
showing 
Americans exactly who they are. In an 
amazing happening this weekend, the 
Conservative 
Political 
Action 
Con-
ference, the largest conservative orga-
nization in America, held their con-
ference in Hungary and welcomed one 
of Europe’s most notorious proponents 
of 
‘‘replacement 
theory,’’ 
Viktor 
Orban, as their keynote speaker. 
Again, the Conservative Political Ac-
tion Conference, a very important or-
ganization 
in 
the 
new 
Republican 
MAGA party, had Viktor Orban as 
their keynote speaker, an autocrat, 
who has whittled away democracy in 
Hungary. 
It is sickening—sickening—to see 
that 2 weeks after the shooting in Buf-
falo, Republicans as prominent as Don-
ald Trump and Tucker Carlson, spoke 
at the same event as one of Europe’s 
most prominent White nationalists and 
authoritarians. It is a scary and other-
worldly turn for one of America’s two 
parties to take. 
I know not all Republicans embrace 
the views of MAGA Republicans. I 
know many of them support women’s 
rights and embrace diversity and reject 
conspiracies like ‘‘White replacement.’’ 
I urge these Republicans in the Sen-
ate and the country to repudiate the 
MAGA wing taking over the GOP. I in-
vite the voters to support Democratic 
candidates as a protest against extre-
mism so we as a nation can halt the 
dangerous rise of the hard right. 
This week, all of us in the Senate 
will have a chance to take a stand 
against extremism by voting to begin 
debate on the Domestic Terrorism Pre-
vention Act. 
For the information of all, I will take 
the first procedural step on this legis-
lation later today, and Members can 
expect to vote on Thursday on this bill 
that will crack down on domestic ter-
rorism and extremism. 
As far as legislation goes, this bill is 
as much of a no-brainer as it comes. 
Two years ago, when Donald Trump 
was President, the House passed this 
bill unanimously. Every single Repub-
lican was for the bill. But in a sign of 
how radicalized the GOP has become, 
nearly every single House Republican 
opposed it last week, despite one Morn-
ing Consult poll that showed that a 
majority of Republicans and Repub-
lican voters support these common-
sense measures. 
Let me say it again. According to one 
Morning Consult poll, a majority of Re-
publican voters support cracking down 
on domestic terrorism. Yet, neverthe-
less, every single House Republican 
voted against this bill last week. 
If you wanted some proof that the 
MAGA wing of the Republican Party is 
taking over the whole party, there it 
is. 
I hope that, given everything hap-
pening across the country right now, 
Senate Republicans will act differently 
and support this bill. 
Let me be clear, Democrats’ goal is 
to pass this bill, just as it is with all 
bills we bring to the Senate floor. But 
if Republicans keep going down their 
extremist, obstructionist path, then 
this vote will still allow the American 
people to hold their elected representa-
tives accountable. 
Not long ago, views like ‘‘replace-
ment theory’’ were relegated to the 
fringes of American society, shared pri-
marily by twisted minds on online mes-
sage boards. But today, White suprem-
acy, which has been with us for decades

May 24, 2022 
and centuries, is now out in the open, 
and proponents speak about it un-
abashedly and unashamedly. 
Many were shocked in 2017, when, out 
in the open, thousands of White su-
premacists marched at the Unite the 
Right rally in Charlottesville and 
chanted: ‘‘You will not replace us.’’ 
It was out in the open on January 6, 
as insurrectionists waved Confederate 
flags through the hallways of this Cap-
itol—the first time that ever occurred 
in American history. 
It is out in the open every time Don-
ald Trump holds a MAGA rally and 
blames undocumented immigrants for 
stealing the 2020 election. 
And it is out in the open on cable 
news networks like FOX, where Tucker 
Carlson has spread ‘‘replacement the-
ory’’ in over 400 episodes, and other 
commentators join in. 
To be sure, the extremism of MAGA 
Republicans is hardly limited to their 
embrace of ridiculous conspiracy theo-
ries. Across the country, the hard right 
is also hell-bent on turning back the 
clock on women’s rights by 100 years, 
pushing restrictions on abortions that 
are wildly outside the mainstream. 
Whether it is a national ban on abor-
tions, which Leader MCCONNELL
ac-
knowledges is possible if Republicans 
win the Senate, or the prosecution of 
women who pursue abortions, or even 
banning businesses that help employ-
ees access abortions out of State, 
MAGA Republicans are openly cham-
pioning restrictions that would have 
been career-enders just a few years ago 
but are now part of GOP canon. We 
cannot ignore who suffers most under 
these radical restrictions: women of 
color, low-income families, families 
who live in deeply gerrymandered 
States, where their views have all been 
but silenced. 
This is what MAGA Republicans 
clamor for: a world ruled by conspiracy 
theories, national abortion bans, and 
the greatest curtailing of individual 
rights in 50 years; a world where immi-
grants and communities of color are 
considered ‘‘replacers’’; where women 
are considered second-class citizens 
and are told what to do with their bod-
ies; where White supremacy is toler-
ated or even embraced; and where our 
democracy erodes in favor of autoc-
racy. 
Imagine again Orban, the leading au-
tocrat of Europe, being the lead speak-
er at CPAC, with President Trump and 
other major Republicans participating. 
Who would think we would see that 
day? Who would think? 
We cannot let these views become ac-
cepted or even become the norm in the 
United States. This week, we can take 
one step of many in helping silence the 
voices of White supremacy, the voices 
of domestic terrorism. 
So I implore my Republican col-
leagues: If you reject the dangers of 
White 
supremacy 
and 
views 
like 
‘‘White replacement,’’ you should vote 
in favor of moving forward to begin de-
bate on this domestic terrorism bill. 
This is a test. This is about account-
ability. Republican Senators, do you 
reject the views of MAGA Republicans? 
Do you reject White supremacy and 
‘‘replacement theory’’? 
Taking a stand against domestic ter-
rorism and White supremacy should be 
the easiest thing in the world. If Re-
publicans can’t join us on something as 
simple as that, Americans will see, 
with even greater clarity, how radical 
the GOP has become under Donald 
Trump and the MAGA Republicans. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Indiana. 
REMEMBERING SERGEANT CHARLES GARRIGUS 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, what de-
fines an American soldier? Is it courage 
under fire? Is it physical strength? Is it 
the great victories on the battlefield? 
No. I think it is something else. Above 
all, it is sacrifice. It is the selflessness 
to surrender one’s life so that a set of 
values will endure not only for the liv-
ing but for generations to come. It is 
the faith that the future of this great 
Nation is more important than the life 
of any one of its citizens; that the 
cause of liberty is greater than any in-
dividual. 
Be that as it may, every fallen hero 
must be remembered. Every individual 
who makes the ultimate sacrifice must 
be honored. That is why, in the spring 
every year, we decorate their graves 
with flowers and the flag they fought 
for. Those headstones made of marble 
or granite are often indistinguishable 
from a distance. Fittingly, their sac-
rifice was the same no matter how fa-
bled or forgotten the battle, no matter 
in victory or defeat; and though we 
rightly revere our glorious triumphs— 
the trenches of Yorktown, the hills of 
Gettysburg, the fields of the Marne, 
the beaches of Normandy—it is often in 
America’s darkest hours, in the face of 
great disaster, when we see the virtues 
of America’s warriors most clearly. 
So it was with SGT Charles Garrigus, 
a farm boy from the town of Francisco 
in Southern Indiana. 
In growing up during the Depression, 
he developed a passion and skill for 
motors, of driving trucks and tractors 
across the Hoosier countryside. It was 
why he was drawn to the U.S. Army; 
why, after his discharge at the end of 
World War II, he reenlisted, serving as 
a motor pool sergeant in Japan. Ser-
geant Garrigus was scheduled to return 
to Indiana on June 26, 1950. One day be-
fore that, on the 25th, the Korean war 
began, and so he again answered the 
call. 
After the initial setbacks, with the 
North Korean People’s Army pushing 
U.S. forces south, by the end of the 
summer, the North Koreans were in re-
treat, and Americans were advancing 
north, up the peninsula. The end of the 
war was in sight. 
GEN Douglas MacArthur divided his 
forces. The Eighth Army went from 
Seoul to Pyongyang. From there, it 
would link with Ten Corps. Sergeant 
Garrigus’s force, the 7th Army Divi-
sion, 32nd Regiment, was assigned to 
guard the Ten Corps’ flank. Once con-
nected, they would march toward the 
Chinese frontier, reunite Korea, and 
end the war. The soldiers might be 
home for Christmas. 
Then came the Battle of Chosin Res-
ervoir, where 100,000 Chinese soldiers 
attacked. The Americans, isolated and 
spread out across the Chosin Reservoir, 
were surrounded; they were trapped. It 
was an unmitigated disaster—one of 
the worst in the history of America’s 
military. The fighting continued for 
two 
more 
nights 
before 
Sergeant 
Garrigus’s regiment consolidated with 
another larger unit, led by COL Allan 
MacLean. 
On the morning of the 29th, their 60- 
vehicle 
convoy 
made 
its 
way 
to 
MacLean’s perimeter. The Chinese fire 
was so heavy, though, that two trucks 
filled with supplies were left on the op-
posite 
of 
the 
bridge 
leading 
to 
MacLean’s 
men. 
When 
Sergeant 
Garrigus looked across that bridge and 
saw Chinese soldiers approaching the 
vehicles, he dashed, on foot, across the 
bridge, reached the first van, and drove 
it back across the ice-covered bridge. 
Then he got out, ran back across the 
bridge again, jumped in the second 
truck, and drove that one across Amer-
ican lines too. Just as he made it over, 
the engine stalled out, but his fellow 
soldiers roared. It was a shot of hope in 
a desperate hour. 
After 80 hours of attacks, the situa-
tion had grown so dire that, on the 
morning of the 30th, the Americans de-
termined to break out and drive over 
mountain roads to the safety of the 
Marine base at Hagaru-ri, at the south-
ern end of the reservoir. They loaded 
what rations and supplies they had 
left, along with the wounded, into 35 
trucks and jeeps, and prepared to set 
out across the narrow mountain roads 
that led to the marines. 
Before they departed, Chinese forces 
commandeered the Americans’ defen-
sive 
machinegun 
posts. 
Sergeant 
Garrigus rallied several other soldiers; 
fought off the Chinese; and retook the 
weapons, turning them on the enemy, 
freeing up the column of vehicles to de-
part. The way was treacherous, along 
rutted, ice-covered roads. The forma-
tion was disorganized, scattered by 
steady Chinese gunfire. 
With Sergeant Garrigus at its head, 
the convoy finally drew near the Ma-
rine base at Hagaru-ri. What was once 
a 35-vehicle convoy was now 15. The 
trucks and jeeps were full of bullet 
holes, but the final run was at hand. 
With mortar blasts exploding along its 
sides, Sergeant Garrigus guided the 
convoy forward. Hagaru-ri was 5 miles 
away, just in reach. Then a tremendous 
blast of machineguns erupted. The lead 
vehicle 
veered 
off 
the 
road 
and 
smashed 
into 
a 
ditch. 
Sergeant 
Garrigus lay dead behind the wheel. 
The entire convoy ground to a halt. 
The surviving soldiers were at the 
mercy of the Chinese. 
SGT Charles Garrigus never returned 
home to Indiana. His name is among

the missing—the ones who answered 
their country’s call and never came 
home. He was awarded the Distin-
guished Service Cross for his service 
and sacrifice. 
Though his mission was doomed, his 
death was not in vain. The fighting at 
Chosin Reservoir distracted the Chi-
nese Army long enough to allow the 
Army to successfully withdraw south— 
the longest withdrawal in American 
history. He and his brothers in arms 
fought like hell, through hell. Their 
chances of victory, of even survival, 
were remote. But they didn’t fight for 
themselves. They fought for their 
countrymen, living and generations 
away, for the ideal of self-government. 
On Memorial Day, we honor all those 
who have died in service to America in 
defense of that ideal. Let us not mis-
take the stillness of the patriot graves 
with silence, though. The rows of 
headstones speak to us of sacrifice for 
the common good. They remind us of 
the price at which our freedom was 
won, of the too often smallness of our 
divisions, of the many reasons for faith 
in our fellow Americans no matter how 
strained our bonds may be, of the bless-
ings we share even if they are obscure, 
and of our ability to pass through any 
trial no matter how daunting. 
When we listen to them, I believe we 
will lift our heads from today’s anxi-
eties and face the future optimisti-
cally. 
As 
the 
story 
of 
Sergeant 
Garrigus shows, we Americans have re-
fused to let far greater obstacles deter 
us or accepted that more difficult prob-
lems can’t be solved. 
Months after his death, at the Chosin 
Reservoir, Sergeant Garrigus’s parents 
received a note of condolence from 
GEN Douglas MacArthur. In it, he 
hoped that the loss of their son in the 
defense of this country offered ‘‘some 
measure of comfort.’’ The letter also 
spoke of the sergeant’s ‘‘devotion to 
duty at the cost of all he held dear.’’ 
Eloquent words or well-meaning ges-
tures on Memorial Day or any day have 
small power to comfort those left be-
hind, but we can take more than a 
measure of comfort and should be eter-
nally grateful that, from our founding 
until today, there have always been 
Americans willing to keep us safe and 
free at the cost of all they hold dear. 
May God bless them and keep them 
in His arms. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
SOLAR ENERGY 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, for years, 
solar power has been a growing source 
of clean, low-cost energy and economic 
development in my State of Nevada, in 
States across our Nation, and surely in 
States like the Presiding Officer’s, in 
California, but Nevada currently has 
the largest solar economy in the coun-
try, with the most solar jobs per cap-
ita—per capita—of any State. 
Supporting 
solar 
energy 
creates 
American jobs, and these jobs are help-
ing us to transition to clean, renewable 
energy. Our domestic solar industry is 
made up of more than 10,000 businesses, 
large and small, located in every single 
State, employing over 250,000 American 
workers. But, at this moment, the 
American solar industry is at risk. All 
of the progress we have made to transi-
tion to clean energy and dramatically 
lower energy costs for American fami-
lies is at risk. Hundreds of thousands of 
good-paying solar jobs are at risk be-
cause of a Department of Commerce in-
vestigation into imported solar panels. 
Our domestic solar industry’s success 
depends on a steady supply of solar 
panels to install. If we don’t have the 
panels to install, we do not have—we 
just don’t have—a domestic solar in-
dustry. 
Unfortunately, 
solar 
panel 
manufacturers in the United States 
can only meet the needs of 15 percent— 
15 percent—of American solar projects. 
That leaves 85 percent of solar projects 
without any access to solar panels, and 
this 
requires—requires—importing 
solar panels. 
And let me make something very 
clear. I 100 percent support ramping up 
domestic solar manufacturing so that 
someday all of our solar panels and 
cells can be made in the United States, 
and I have introduced a bipartisan bill 
with Senator JERRY MORAN to do just 
that. However, today, we simply do not 
have the capacity or the capability to 
manufacture enough panels to meet de-
mand or to support the hundreds of 
thousands of American workers—many 
in union jobs—whose livelihoods—well, 
they depend on access to available, af-
fordable solar panels. 
Utilities across the country, and es-
pecially in the southwestern States, 
are shifting to renewable solar energy. 
They have already hired workers and 
in many cases have made multimillion- 
dollar investments to do so. These are 
good-paying jobs, which often require 
special expertise to install and main-
tain our solar installations. 
But since the administration’s inves-
tigation was launched, there have been 
widespread reports of project cancella-
tions and layoffs. It has thrown the en-
tire solar industry into uncertainty, 
and it is threatening jobs. It is setting 
us back on our clean energy goals, and 
it is just sending—well, sending the 
wrong message to our communities as 
they plan for their infrastructure in-
vestments. 
One industry report states that as a 
result of the solar freeze, over 80 per-
cent of American solar companies—I 
want to repeat that—over 80 percent of 
American solar companies are facing 
cancellations; they are facing delays on 
all the materials that they need. 
Projects are on pause, companies are 
facing closure, and American jobs— 
people’s livelihoods—they are in jeop-
ardy. 
Earlier this month, the State of Indi-
ana announced that, due to the inves-
tigation, it will not be able to complete 
its solar projects on time and will have 
to keep its coal-powered plant opened 
several years longer than initially 
planned. They won’t be able to com-
plete their solar panels in time. 
And in my State of Nevada, NV En-
ergy, the State’s largest power com-
pany, has said that this investigation 
is causing massive disruptions to mul-
tiple Nevada solar projects that would 
provide low-cost—low-cost—power to 
more than 114,000 homes. This is hurt-
ing President Biden’s own clean energy 
goals. It is reversing our progress to-
ward clean, renewable energy. 
I have highlighted all this in bipar-
tisan letters that I have led to the De-
partment of Commerce and to the 
White House signed by nearly a quarter 
of the Senate, including many of the 
colleagues you are going to hear from 
today. 
If the Department of Commerce con-
tinues down the path we are on and en-
acts additional and retroactive solar 
tariffs, more than 100,000 American 
jobs could be lost. Hard-working fami-
lies across this country will feel the 
pain of this decision that will cause en-
ergy costs—they are going to cause en-
ergy costs to go up. 
Americans 
are 
already 
getting 
squeezed at the gas pump, facing his-
toric inflation, and paying more for 
groceries. We cannot allow home en-
ergy costs to increase as well. 
The administration—they can pre-
vent this outcome and quell the panic 
in the solar industry by swiftly bring-
ing the Department of Commerce’s 
misguided investigation to an end. 
I understand and respect the Depart-
ment of Commerce’s need to be thor-
ough in investigating any claims of un-
fair trade practices, but as I have been 
pointing out, this petition is built upon 
a house of cards. The petition for the 
investigation was brought by one—one 
single solar company relying on data 
from researchers who say the com-
pany’s claims are wrong and that the 
claims and the complaint do not accu-
rately reflect their research. 
We cannot let this one single com-
pany use data in a misleading way to 
destroy 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
American jobs. We must support and 
build our U.S. solar manufacturing, 
and I stand ready to work with all my 
colleagues to make that possible. But 
there are supply needs that need to be 
met right now, and we cannot simply 
build our domestic solar manufac-
turing overnight. This is not an either- 
or situation. We need to do both. Amer-
ican jobs are on the line. We need a res-
olution. 
So I call on the Department of Com-
merce and the White House again to 
use every resource at their disposal to 
expedite this process and get American 
solar—well, let’s get us back on track. 
President Biden, we need action 
today; not next week, not next month, 
or later this summer. Hundreds of 
thousands of American solar workers, 
their families, our communities, they 
are counting on you.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2642 
May 24, 2022 
Today, we will hear from several of 
my colleagues on this critically impor-
tant issue, and I look forward to hear-
ing from them about how we can con-
tinue to work together to save Amer-
ican jobs and protect our climate fu-
ture. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I, along with my colleague Senator 
ROSEN, am pleased to be able to speak 
out today. We have both been working 
throughout our time here in the U.S. 
Senate to support Nevada’s booming 
renewable energy industry, including 
our solar sector for so many of the rea-
sons that my friend and colleague Sen-
ator ROSEN highlighted right now. 
There is one thing that is important 
to also understand, and I want to put 
this in perspective. In 2020, I helped to 
secure extensions of the investment 
tax credit and the residential renew-
able energy tax credit for solar so that 
we could increase private sector invest-
ments in this critical sector. 
What has happened is, with this in-
vestigation—and don’t get me wrong, 
and I think all of my colleagues feel 
the same way—that under the statute, 
under the code, the Commerce Depart-
ment has every right to investigate 
this circumvention petition. That is 
not the issue that, for me, we are com-
ing here today. What we are asking the 
administration to do, at least from my 
perspective, is pursuant to that very 
statute, under sub (f), the adminis-
trator—in this case, the Department of 
Commerce and their incredible staff, 
which they do have working on this— 
are required to make a determination 
within 300 days of the petition being 
filed—within 300 days of the petition 
being filed. What we are asking is for 
that swift determination to be made. 
Here is why: Because we know in our 
State, and what I am hearing from so 
many of the industry in my State, it is 
having a chilling effect from us moving 
forward and being able to move forward 
to, quite honestly, achieve this admin-
istration’s 
goal 
of 
aggressive 
decarbonization targets for this coun-
try and for our future. 
What I do know is this: Because of 
the chilling effect it is having during 
this period of investigation, there are a 
couple of things that are happening. In 
the solar industry right now, every-
thing is on hold. There are concerns 
that, depending on how the outcome of 
this investigation rolls out, there could 
be retroactive tariffs applied to these 
solar industries, more costs to these 
solar industries. So, of course, any 
business is going to say, wait, I don’t 
know in the industry what the lay of 
the land is right now, what my costs 
are going to be, so I am going to stop 
moving forward until I know the re-
sults of that investigation, because if 
there are retroactive tariffs, retro-
active costs to me, I want to be able to 
know about that as a business owner. 
Here is the other thing: Because of 
this chilling effect, because nothing is 
moving forward, I talked about the fact 
that we actually passed, under the pre-
vious administration, in 2020, exten-
sions of the investment tax credit and 
the residential renewable energy tax 
credit for solar. So we gave incentives 
to the solar industry in 2021 and 2022, 
at 26 percent so that we can build up 
our solar industry; so that we can re-
duce our carbon footprint; so we can 
meet our decarbonization aggressive 
goals that we had. And then at 26 per-
cent, they are entitled to that tax cred-
it from years 2021 to 2022, and then it 
goes down to 22 percent in year 2023, 
down to 10 percent in year 2024 for com-
mercial, and 0 percent for 2024 residen-
tial. If nothing is moving forward, no-
body is getting the benefits of that in-
vestment tax credit that we fought so 
hard for under the previous administra-
tion to move forward with. 
Here is what our challenge is in this 
country: Yes, we are all here because 
we want to move forward with this 
decarbonization. We want to move for-
ward with clean energy. Solar is a way 
to do that. But we need a ramp to get 
there. We cannot shut off the compo-
nents, the modules, the panels—every-
thing we need. And 80 percent of those 
panels come from outside of this coun-
try. We cannot shut it down overnight 
and expect our small solar manufac-
turing companies to achieve the capac-
ity that we need in this country to con-
tinue to move forward. So we need a 
longer ramp. We need to figure out, 
working together, how we make this 
happen, with our ultimate goal being 
reducing that carbon footprint in this 
country, bringing back that supply 
chain and building and making it in 
America again, all of those panels, the 
modules, everything that we need for 
solar. But it can’t be done overnight. 
Yes, we have put those investments 
out there to bring that manufacturing 
here. Yes, we have a new plant going in 
in Ohio, which is fantastic. But I will 
tell you, that one plant alone isn’t 
enough to achieve what we need in ca-
pacity for the solar industry in this 
country. 
So as we stand here, what is hap-
pening is that nothing is moving for-
ward, and we now have a potential of 
losing out potentially to other coun-
tries and slowing down a process that 
we need to reach our clean energy 
goals for this country. 
That is why so many of my col-
leagues, including in Nevada but across 
the country, are coming up and talking 
with the administration. What we are 
just asking is for the administration to 
understand the challenges that we are 
facing right now but at the same time, 
make a swift, determined investigation 
and action. Do it quickly, quickly, so 
that we can move forward, so that the 
solar industry has the information that 
it needs. 
Why are we so vocal about this? I 
will tell you, Nevada’s solar industry is 
the largest in the Nation. The industry 
supports more jobs per capita in my 
State than in any other. Many of those 
are union jobs, and they are on hold 
right now, and nothing is moving for-
ward right now. That is not, I don’t be-
lieve, the intent of the administration 
or what we have been trying to achieve 
here at the end of the day as we look 
forward to a clean energy economy. 
I know this industry in my State 
makes our economy much stronger and 
more resilient. Solar and other renew-
ables help us meet our climate goals 
and enhance our energy independence 
in this country, which we need now 
more than ever. An investment in re-
newable energy is lowering energy 
costs for Nevadans across the State. 
Right now, my concern is because of 
the hundreds of union-trained workers 
whose progress on building out critical 
solar capacity will be at risk if they 
can’t get the material they need to 
move forward quickly—we are slowing 
down not only the potential to meet 
that clean energy future, but we are 
slowing our economy, and we are put-
ting too many of our good-paying 
union workers out of jobs right now. 
So my request, and I believe with my 
colleagues, was that we are asking the 
Commerce Department just to make a 
swift decision here. Yes, they should be 
doing this. Yes, this is their right 
under the statute. Yes, the circumven-
tion petition is important so that we 
can prevent any type of dumping by 
other countries and flooding our mar-
ket. Absolutely, I agree. But within the 
provisions of the trade laws that we 
have right now and the statute, the 
Commerce Department rightly does the 
investigation, but they can do it quick-
ly. And that is all we are asking here. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this 
week, the solar industry in this coun-
try is at something in naval aviation 
that we call refusal speed. Now, what is 
refusal speed? Refusal speed is the 
speed at which an aircraft continues to 
pick up speed on its takeoff roll or 
abandon, abort that takeoff roll and re-
main on the ground. That is what re-
fusal speed is. 
In recent years, America’s solar en-
ergy industry has been rolling down 
the runway, picking up speed every 
day. Unfortunately, there are forces at 
large today that threaten to abort the 
takeoff roll and ground this vital in-
dustry. 
Today, I join my colleagues in rising 
to express our grave concerns about a 
challenge that threatens to bring the 
solar industry to a halt—to a halt—not 
from climate change deniers but from 
our own Federal Government. 
As we speak, Mr. President, the U.S. 
Commerce Department is investigating 
whether solar energy products coming 
from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and 
Cambodia should be subject to the 
same tariffs as are currently in place 
for products coming here from China. 
This investigation is currently freezing 
access to these products for American 
businesses that import and deploy

them across our country, and the 
threat of astronomical tariffs looms 
large. 
As a result, a number of our col-
leagues are deeply concerned about the 
impact of the Commerce investigation 
not only on the solar industry but also 
on our ability to combat the climate 
crisis and meet President Biden’s bold 
climate goals. We are already in danger 
of running out of time to reduce green-
house gas emissions. I know that. The 
Presiding Officer knows that. All our 
colleagues realize that. Now this inves-
tigation 
threatens 
to 
create 
an 
unforced error—an unforced error—in 
our commitment to protect our planet. 
We don’t have time for an unforced 
error. We are not waiting for the cli-
mate crisis to arrive; the climate crisis 
is here, and it is here now. 
Without bold action, our country and 
our planet will continue to feel ever 
more devastating impacts. Already, in 
the last year alone, we have witnessed 
wildfires burning millions of acres in 
California, 
Montana, 
Arizona, 
and 
other Western States—fires as big as 
my State. The same hurricane that 
knocked out access to power and water 
for a million people in Louisiana and 
Mississippi then went on to produce 
flash floods in New Jersey and New 
York. People there actually drowned in 
their basements, unable to escape the 
torrent of floodwater. 
To prevent further devastating, irre-
versible effects of climate change and 
protect our planet for future genera-
tions, 
we 
need 
to 
continue 
transitioning our Nation and our plan-
et away from fossil fuels. Among other 
things, we should be doing everything 
in our power to lift up innovators in 
the solar industry, to boldly cut emis-
sions from our power sector, and to at-
tack this climate crisis head-on. But, 
unfortunately, the Commerce Depart-
ment’s investigation threatens to ham-
string one of the strongest weapons in 
our fight: clean renewable energy. 
The prospect of as much as a 250-per-
cent tariff on solar products will have 
an immediate, disastrous impact on a 
leading renewable energy source for 
our Nation. Effectively, we would be 
punishing the very green industry that 
is helping to lead the charge to curb 
emissions and further reduce our Na-
tion’s reliance on fossil fuels. 
We would be punishing the hundreds 
of thousands of Americans who work in 
the solar industry. In fact, the Solar 
Energy Industries Association esti-
mates that this investigation currently 
underway threatens 70,000 jobs between 
now and 2025—70,000 jobs. But more 
than that, we have heard from busi-
nesses in the solar industry that say 
that the very threat of these tariffs is 
already freezing imports needed to 
build solar infrastructure and bolster 
our defense against the climate crisis. 
The idea that solar companies may 
have to sit around waiting for January 
2023 to come around just to see if in-
dustry-rocking 
tariffs 
will 
be 
an-
nounced—that alone is destabilizing. It 
is worse than destabilizing; it already 
risks bringing investments to a stand-
still, while adding uncertainty to the 
solar market and pushing utility com-
panies to slow their transition away 
from fossil fuels out of fear for a 
change in American climate priorities, 
because that is what is at stake here. 
What do we value? Are we committed 
to a clean energy future, a transition 
to a 100-percent carbon pollution-free 
electric sector by 2035 and to pro-
tecting American jobs and lives from 
an impending climate crisis or are we 
OK with the status quo, with holding 
back our renewable energy prospects 
and continuing to let politics dictate 
our planet’s future? 
Across this Nation, Americans are 
feeling the effects of climate change in 
every storm surge and every coastal 
flood. We certainly see that in my 
home State of Delaware. We are the 
lowest lying State in America. The 
seas around us are rising. My State is 
sinking. Americans across the country 
are ready to do whatever it takes to 
save our planet and create a ton of jobs 
at the same time. 
I implore the Biden administration 
to swiftly expedite its investigation 
rather than drag this process out and 
add to the uncertainty of businesses 
across our country and to rule out ret-
roactive, job-killing tariffs in the proc-
ess. 
In this moment—in this moment—we 
have to act with greater urgency to 
drive down emissions. In this moment, 
we have to unleash the power of Amer-
ican clean energy. In this moment, we 
need to protect our planet for genera-
tions to come. 
To fall short of our commitment 
would be to let down all of those who 
inherit this planet from us. Make no 
mistake, future generations will look 
back at this critical moment in our Na-
tion’s history to see what we did when 
our planet was on the line. Heaven for-
bid they look back and see that our 
own hand—our own hand—forced this 
error. 
Again, I implore this administration 
to end this investigation, lift up the 
solar industry, and help us meet our 
Nation’s climate goals. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
the first stanza of our national anthem 
ends with ‘‘O say does that star-span-
gled banner yet wave o’er the land of 
the free and the home of the brave?’’ 
We sing this part as a triumphant 
declaration, but if you read the lyrics 
of the ‘‘Star-Spangled Banner,’’ the 
sentence actually ends with a question 
mark. Francis Scott Key intended this 
line to be sung as a question rather 
than a statement. That is fitting be-
cause, while our freedom may be con-
crete, hate and evil threaten the secu-
rity of our freedom from one genera-
tion to the next. 
Over the years, our national anthem 
took on a feeling of confidence and as-
surance rather than uncertainty, and 
that is thanks to the millions of men 
and women who bravely answered the 
call to serve. Many soldiers lost their 
lives to give us the security we all 
enjoy and the assurance we are proud 
of. That is what we keep in our hearts 
and on our minds as we honor the fall-
en on this Memorial Day. 
Throughout the course of our Na-
tion’s history, our freedom has been 
protected by those who stood toe to toe 
with hate and evil, endured sleepless 
nights on the battlefield, rough days at 
sea, harsh conditions in the desert, and 
years living in a far corner of the globe 
so that we, as Americans, can sleep 
peacefully in the comfort and security 
of our home. 
Sadly, some of our Nation’s heroes 
never ever returned. My State of Ala-
bama lost 2,500 soldiers during World 
War I, 5,114 soldiers during World War 
II, and hundreds and hundreds of others 
in wars since. 
Alabama pays tribute to those who 
have made the ultimate sacrifice with 
memorials across our State. More than 
400,000 people visit the USS Alabama 
Battleship Memorial Park in Mobile 
annually, where they learn more about 
our military and those who served. The 
city of Trussville, AL, recently broke 
ground on the Alabama Fallen Warrior 
Monument to honor Alabama service-
members killed since 9/11. 
But these sites are more than just 
landmarks; they tell stories of count-
less lives that were forever changed— 
the stories of daughters, sons, hus-
bands, wives, mothers, and fathers who 
answered the call to defend our coun-
try at home and abroad, not knowing 
what their future would hold; stories of 
mothers who hugged their children and 
husbands who kissed their wives with-
out knowing if it was for the last time. 
Every year on Memorial Day, we pause 
to honor these heroes and reflect on 
the price they have paid for our free-
dom. 
Today, I would like to recognize 
some of Alabama’s fallen soldiers who 
have paid freedom’s high cost and the 
Gold Star families who still grieve 
from their absence. 
Many of our fallen servicemembers 
had not yet reached the prime of their 
lives. Some were still in high school 
when they answered the call to service. 
That is true for PFC James Joshua, 
Jr., of Gadsden, AL, who left high 
school to become a U.S. marine at the 
young age of 18. This bright young man 
adored his family, and his dreams for 
his life were like that of many 18-year- 
olds. 
Private Joshua had great aspirations 
of travel, and he wanted a successful 
career, but he also felt a higher calling 
to serve his country in Vietnam. The 
second oldest of eight children, Private 
Joshua was a natural protector who 
wanted to make sure his family and his 
country were safe, so he deployed as a 
marine, but he never returned home. 
On May 22, 1968, his life was cut short. 
He was killed when his company was

attacked with mortars in Vietnam’s 
Quang Tri Province. 
Private Joshua’s younger sister Judy 
recalls getting ready for her high 
school graduation when the notifica-
tion officers arrived with news of her 
brother’s passing. A day that started as 
a celebration of graduation turned into 
a day of tragedy as she, her mother, 
and her sisters received the news. Still 
Judy remembers the screams in shock 
and despair. 
The Joshua family never got over the 
passing of their beloved brother and 
son James. Judy’s mom especially 
struggled to cope with the loss. She 
passed away from a heart attack at age 
49, which Judy attributes to the grief 
she experienced following the tragic 
loss. 
Private Joshua was posthumously 
awarded a Bronze Star and a Purple 
Heart for his courage and his bravery. 
His hometown of Gadsden honors his 
service at Central-Carver Museum’s 
Wall of Honor. He is also honored on 
Panel 65E, Line 11, of the Wall of Faces 
at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial 
here in Washington, DC. Private Josh-
ua gave his country the best years of 
his life, a sacrifice we can never fully 
repay. 
Sadly, his life is not the only in-
stance of years cut short because of 
service to our country. Private First 
Class 
Thomas 
Stagg, 
known 
as 
Tommy, from Birmingham, AL, was 
declared missing in action in 1950 dur-
ing the Korean war. He was 21 years old 
at the time. He and 10 other para-
troopers from the U.S. Army 187th Reg-
imental Combat Team were on a patrol 
in the Hwanghae Province when they 
were overwhelmed by Chinese forces. 
All 11 members were declared dead and 
missing in action. 
Private 
Stagg 
received 
several 
awards for his services, including a 
Purple Heart and a National Defense 
Service Medal. 
Private 
Stagg’s 
nephew, 
Colonel 
Larry Leonard, was very young when 
his family received the news about his 
uncle, but he witnessed the toll it took 
on his mother who had already lost an-
other brother during World War II. 
Colonel Leonard shared that his moth-
er’s dying wish was for her little broth-
er to be found and returned to Bir-
mingham to be buried alongside her 
and their parents. Five years ago, Colo-
nel Leonard saw his mother’s wish ful-
filled. Thanks to the help of the De-
fense POW/MIA Accounting Agency or 
the DPAA under the Department of De-
fense, Private Stagg’s remains were 
identified and returned home for a 
proper memorial service in 2017, more 
than 67 years after he was declared 
missing. 
Colonel Leonard says that while Me-
morial Day is a somber day, it is im-
portant 
to 
recognize 
those 
who 
‘‘thought so much of their country 
they were willing to give their lives for 
it.’’ 
I know it is estimated more than 
81,600 missing American soldiers are 
still missing since World War I—81,600 
still missing. 
Some families are still searching for 
answers, like Teresa Schmitt of Hunts-
ville, AL, who was only 8 years old 
when her father, U.S. Air Force Tech-
nical Sergeant Elbert Phillips’ airplane 
crashed in the Mekong River during 
the Vietnam war. Sergeant Phillips’ 
body was never recovered, but he was 
presumed dead and labeled missing in 
action. 
Teresa was one of six children be-
tween the ages of 4 and 11 who were left 
behind. She spoke of the many days 
and nights she spent waiting to see if 
her father would ever be found and the 
heartbreak of growing up knowing that 
he would never be present to teach her 
how to ride a bike, meet her high 
school boyfriends, celebrate her grad-
uation, or walk down the aisle at her 
wedding. 
Teresa’s mother committed to rais-
ing her children alone, never remarry-
ing in the hopes that her husband 
would return. Sergeant Phillips re-
ceived numerous awards for his cour-
age, including the National Defense 
Service Medal with one Battle Star and 
the Air Force Commendation Medal 
with Oak Leaf Cluster. He is honored 
at the Huntsville Veterans Memorial in 
Alabama and on Panel 46W, Line 52, of 
the Wall of Faces at the Vietnam Vet-
erans Memorial here in Washington, 
DC. 
The Phillips family reminds us of the 
ordinary moments we take for granted 
and the immense sacrifice of Gold Star 
families. 
Our military defends us abroad, but 
also protects us here right at home 
when acts of terror occur on American 
soil. That is the story of U.S. Navy 
Petty Officer 1st class Marsha Ratch-
ford, a native of Prichard, AL, who was 
killed when hijackers crashed Amer-
ican Airlines flight 77 into her office on 
the western side of the Pentagon on 
September 11, 2001. 
She is described by her family as 
someone with a huge, huge heart who 
was passionate about helping those in 
need. The 34-year-old mother left be-
hind a husband and three young chil-
dren ages 11, 8, and 18 months. She was 
awarded a Purple Heart for her courage 
in the wake of one of the most horrific 
days in America’s history. 
Officer Ratchford’s son Rodney told 
the story of learning about his moth-
er’s passing when he arrived home to 
see his father crying as he held the 
telephone and recalled him seeing the 
Pentagon in flames on television. Rod-
ney described the next day without his 
mother like ‘‘waking up in a new 
world.’’ His teenage years were met 
with the struggles of relocating to be 
near loved ones without having his 
mother’s loving hand as a guide. 
Rodney’s story is another heart-
breaking example of Gold Star children 
who faced a childhood they didn’t ask 
for but were given as a result of the un-
thinkable sacrifices their loved ones 
made for freedom. Their courage is no 
doubt a testament to the brave parents 
who raised them. 
It is impossible to speak of Gold Star 
families without mentioning the par-
ents who are robbed of the joy of seeing 
their children grow up and have fami-
lies of their own. Danny Jordan from 
Elba, AL, is one such Gold Star parent. 
Danny’s 
son, 
U.S. 
Army 
Sergeant 
Jason Jordan of the 101st Airborne Di-
vision, was killed in the Iraqi village of 
Tallifar on the night of July 20, 2003, 
when his humvee was attacked by 
rocket-propelled 
grenades. 
Even 
though it was not required for the 24- 
year-old, he chose to go on patrol that 
night because he would not ask his 
company to do something he wasn’t 
willing to do himself. 
Because of his service and sacrifice, 
Sergeant Jordan earned the Combat In-
fantryman Badge, a Purple Heart, and 
a Gold Star. Sergeant Jordan is hon-
ored in Elba at the ‘‘Lest They Be For-
gotten’’ memorial at Veterans Memo-
rial Park in Alba. 
Danny describes his son as a natural- 
born leader who led by example. He 
said Jason was studying chemical engi-
neering prior to his military service 
but joined the military because he felt 
there was a need. Danny said Jason was 
a hard worker who loved his home-
town, his State, and his country. To 
cope with his grief, Danny drives the 
truck that once belonged to his son. 
For fathers like Danny, holding onto 
ordinary possessions of their loved ones 
helps them feel close even after they 
have passed on. 
These are the stories of Americans 
who gave their lives for freedom’s 
cause—mothers, brothers, sisters, and 
sons who became heroes to all of us. 
There are many, many others who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice for all of 
us and for our country. These heroes 
lived lives of impact, driven by a desire 
to serve their country at any cost. We 
tell their story to keep their memory 
alive and ensure their sacrifices are 
never, never forgotten. And as long as 
there are brave men and women like 
those I’ve mentioned today, we can 
continue to sing the national anthem— 
not with a question mark, but with a 
declaration that we are the ‘‘land of 
the free and the home of the brave.’’ 
As Memorial Day approaches, I hope 
we will take the time to honor Amer-
ica’s fallen, along with the brave fami-
lies who they left behind and always 
remember that our freedoms were won 
by men and women who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF DARA LINDENBAUM 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, Dara 
Lindenbaum is the President’s nominee

credentials for the job and her under-
standing of the agency’s mission and 
the role of a commissioner. 
On May 3, she was favorably reported 
out of committee. I supported her nom-
ination to be voted out of committee. 
The 
Federal 
Elections 
Commission 
plays a vital role for Campaign Finance 
Committees. As a former Secretary of 
State, I work with the FTC on a reg-
ular basis; and since that time, I have 
run in many Federal elections. I know 
how important a fully functioning FEC 
is to Federal candidates who need to 
avail themselves of the FEC’s guidance 
and advisory opinions. I also know how 
important the stability of the agency 
is to the regulated community. 
While the commissioners to the Fed-
eral Election Commission are, by de-
sign, partisan, it is unlikely that every 
Senator will agree with the views of all 
nominees. Ms. Lindenbaum has ex-
pressed a willingness to work with the 
other commissioners and find con-
sensus to do the important work of the 
agency. I am a Republican and Ms. 
Lindenbaum is a Democrat. This Com-
mission only works with if there is an 
equal 
number 
of 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats. 
Sadly, with the three Republican 
nominees from the last administration, 
the vote on the floor was 49 to 43, 49 to 
47, 50 to 46. These should not be par-
tisan nominations. They are partisans 
nominated to a partisan job; and, 
frankly, we have to do a better job 
than 49 to 43, or 49 to 47, or 50 to 46, 
which, again, was the vote on the floor 
of President Trump’s Republican nomi-
nees who are currently serving. 
Ms. Lindenbaum enjoys the support 
of a bipartisan group of election law 
practitioners. Senator KLOBUCHAR and 
I received a letter from 30 practitioners 
on both sides of the aisle highlighting 
Ms. Lindenbaum’s decade of relevant 
experience, especially her experience 
representing clients on matters of 
State and Federal campaign finance 
and election laws. 
I look forward to supporting her 
nomination today. I hope many of my 
colleagues will join me in supporting 
her. This a commission, one, that 
doesn’t work without an equal number 
of Republicans and Democrats, and it 
doesn’t work if the commission doesn’t 
have at least that equal number. Un-
less there are at least four commis-
sioners, the Commission ceases to func-
tion. For too many months of the last 
dozen years, we had a Commission that 
wasn’t 
fully 
functioning, 
couldn’t 
make final decisions, couldn’t issue 
opinions. I am looking forward to a six- 
member Commission. 
I look forward to voting for Ms. 
Lindenbaum today when her nomina-
tion comes up early this afternoon. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJA´ N). The Senator from Colorado. 
SOLAR ENERGY 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am 
here today to spend a few minutes on 
an issue that is profoundly important 
to Colorado and, I would say, to the 
Presiding Officer’s State, as well, with-
out being presumptuous, New Mexico, 
our neighbor to the south. 
In March, the Biden administration 
launched an investigation into whether 
China is evading solar tariffs. That 
may seem fine on its face, but, in re-
ality, it has taken a sledge hammer to 
the solar industry in Colorado and all 
across the country. 
There are over 330 solar companies in 
my State. They have created nearly 
7,000 jobs and driven close to $5 billion 
of investment. Our companies are lead-
ing the Nation. Last year, we nearly 
quadrupled our deployment of solar ca-
pacity compared to 2017, and before the 
Biden administration’s investigation, 
we were projected to double or even tri-
ple that capacity. 
Washington should be lifting up Colo-
rado’s success as exactly the kind of 
progress we need to achieve net zero 
emissions by 2050, which we have to do. 
Instead, the Commerce Department’s 
investigation is driving our solar in-
dustry out of business, because it could 
end with a massive expansion of tariffs 
that could drive up costs and cripple 
that sector. 
Worse, the administration has said 
they might even apply these tariffs 
retroactively. Think about that. If you 
are a solar company in Colorado, you 
are already dealing with supply chain 
delays, you are already dealing with 
labor issues, and you are already deal-
ing with rising prices and continued 
uncertainty over the clean energy tax 
credit, because this place can’t get its 
act together to pass legislation that 
can give certainty to American busi-
ness. 
And now, on top of all of that, you 
face the prospect of your own govern-
ment sending the price of your supplies 
through the roof when you need that 
least. 
Businesses can’t make decisions with 
that kind of uncertainty. Investors 
hate that level of uncertainty. And 
these aren’t talking points. This is the 
reality on the ground. 
In Colorado, the price of solar panels 
is already up 30 to 50 percent, and we 
know Colorado families are ultimately 
going to bear that cost, and that it is 
going to slow our energy transition. 
Many of our solar companies have 
begun hiring freezes. Some are consid-
ering 
major 
layoffs. 
Construction 
workers are losing hundreds of thou-
sands of hours. Investors are pulling 
out of major projects. It has put hun-
dreds of millions of dollars and thou-
sands of jobs at risk, which is why I am 
here to ring this alarm. 
More than 90 percent of solar compa-
nies surveyed in Colorado report ‘‘se-
vere’’ or ‘‘devastating’’ harms to their 
businesses from this investigation by 
the Commerce Department. 
In my State, we have major solar 
projects that are frozen in place, and if 
this continues, they may never move 
forward at all. A lot of these projects 
are in rural counties that are counting 
on the projects being built for jobs and 
tax revenue. This is the last thing they 
need from Washington. 
A 
200-megawatt 
solar 
project 
in 
Pueblo was just canceled since the de-
veloper can’t get the components they 
need. Another 150-megawatt project in 
northern Colorado has been delayed. A 
community solar developer told me 
they have canceled all of their new 
construction for the rest of the year. 
Utilities in my State, like United 
Power and Tri-State, are ready to sup-
port hundreds of megawatts in new 
projects, but our solar companies can’t 
submit bids because they don’t have 
the certainty to do it. 
One 80-megawatt project in Watkins 
is demobilized as they wait for solar 
panels. A project at Denver Inter-
national Airport is indefinitely de-
layed, and I have heard story after 
story like this since this Commerce De-
partment decision to have this inves-
tigation was made. 
If you add it all up, this investigation 
has put at least 870 megawatts of new 
solar capacity at risk in Colorado, and 
it has put more than 50 gigawatts at 
risk across the entire country. That is 
enough to power nearly 10 million 
homes. 
I cannot understand why the Biden 
administration is doing this. You can’t 
say, on the one hand, we want to rap-
idly deploy clean energy and then use 
the other hand to stick a dagger in 
American solar. You can’t say we are 
going to fight climate change and then 
punch American solar in the gut. 
Last 
year, 
electricity 
generation 
from coal increased—increased—in this 
country for the first time since 2014. 
And at the same time that is hap-
pening, now what we are going to say is 
that we are going to cut the deploy-
ment of solar panels by a third or by 
half, as a result of this? 
It 
is 
crazy. 
The 
administration 
should have viewed that alone—the 
fact that coal is up for the first time 
since 2014—they should have viewed 
that alone as a reason to increase our 
investments in clean energy, not pur-
sue an investigation that is sabotaging 
one of the fastest growing sectors in 
Colorado and across the country. 
I also don’t understand why the ad-
ministration would do this at this time 
when we have to find a way to replace 
Russian oil because of what Putin has 
done in Ukraine, and we should be re-
placing that with our own oil produc-
tion and with our reserves in this coun-
try. 
But you would think that supporting 
American solar would be on the top of 
the list as one of the best things we can 
do to diversify our energy and protect 
our security. Instead, the administra-
tion has paralyzed the industry with 
this investigation. It is a self-inflicted 
wound on America’s clean energy lead-
ership, our energy security, and our 
economy at the worst possible mo-
ment. 
I have said this before, and I will say 
it again. I deeply believe that we need 
to restore critical supply chains, not

just for solar but for so many areas 
that are critical to our economy. 
I think the era where we told our-
selves the story about why we were 
privileging people who wanted to make 
stuff as cheaply as possible in China in-
stead of privileging other important 
things, like protecting our supply 
chains, like protecting our national se-
curity, like having an economy that, 
when it grows, grows for everybody, 
not just the people at the very top—we 
have an incredible opportunity to bring 
these supply chains home in order to 
do that. 
I think reshoring is an essential part 
of an economy, as I say, that works for 
everybody, not just those at the top, 
but that is going to take time, and we 
can’t drive people out of business today 
when we don’t have that supply chain 
in place. Until then, until we do have it 
in place, we can’t cripple America’s 
solar industry. That can’t be our pol-
icy. That can’t be the right answer. 
I am sure if the Biden administration 
understood the facts on the ground, it 
wouldn’t be doing what it is doing. The 
least the administration could do is lift 
the uncertainty off the solar industry 
by coming out and saying: We are drop-
ping this investigation. In fact, they 
should have said: We are going to boost 
American 
solar—that 
is 
what 
we 
should be doing—by extending the 
clean energy tax credits and giving 
businesses certainty over the long 
term. On top of that, what we should be 
doing is strengthening the credits. And 
then we are going to do everything we 
can to take every action that we can to 
clear the path for American solar de-
ployment—wind and other types of 
clean energy—to accelerate our transi-
tion. 
That is what they should say. Unlike 
this investigation, that would be wel-
come news in Colorado and, I would 
say, almost everywhere across the 
country. 
NOMINATION OF CHARLOTTE N. SWEENEY 
Mr. President, I wanted to take a few 
minutes 
to 
talk 
about 
Charlotte 
Sweeney, who is President Biden’s 
nominee for the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Colorado. 
For Charlotte, equality under the law 
isn’t an abstraction; it is her life’s 
work. 
A native of Littleton, CO, Charlotte 
grew up hiking and skiing with her 
family on the Rocky Mountain trails 
within an hour of their home. Today, 
she hits the same trails with the two 
most important people in her life: her 
teenagers Jordan and Addison. 
As much as Charlotte loves our 
State, she also remembers a time when 
it wasn’t easy for LGBTQ Coloradans 
like herself to be open about who they 
were, especially—especially—at work. 
It was a time when, instead of leading 
the Nation on equality, as we are 
today, Colorado actually passed an 
amendment that blocked laws to pro-
tect LGBTQ people from discrimina-
tion. 
You know, I just want to pause by 
saying that, you know, sometimes peo-
ple say ‘‘Well, you can’t make a dif-
ference in this country’’ and ‘‘The de-
mocracy is broken, and you can’t make 
progress.’’ But when you see the way 
Colorado 
has 
made 
extraordinary 
progress, it reminds me that we should 
never give up, that change is always 
possible. 
When the Colorado Supreme Court 
declared that amendment unconstitu-
tional that we had passed, Charlotte 
saw the power of law to tip the scales 
for or against—for or against—equal-
ity, and she decided to spend the rest of 
her career on the side of equality. 
After graduating summa cum laude 
from the University of Denver School 
of Law, she joined a small firm that fo-
cused on representing plaintiffs. She 
rose to become a partner in just 2 
years, and just 2 years after that, she 
became a named partner of the firm. 
Most people would have been content 
with that achievement, but Charlotte, 
being Charlotte, kept on going. In 2008, 
she started her own firm to represent 
people in employment law cases. Over 
the last 20 years, Charlotte has become 
one of Colorado’s top employment at-
torneys, representing Federal, State, 
and private sector workers in virtually 
every aspect of employment law. 
In one case, she represented her 
former law professors at the University 
of Denver who had been paid less than 
their male colleagues for decades. She 
obtained $2.6 million in relief for her 
clients on top of their overdue pay 
raises. 
Sadly, that outcome isn’t the norm 
in our country, where our justice sys-
tem too often sides against workers 
even when the facts of the case are ac-
tually on their side. That is corrosive 
to the American people’s confidence in 
the rule of law, and it is why we need 
more judges with Charlotte’s perspec-
tive. 
Charlotte’s obvious credentials, her 
integrity, and her much needed experi-
ence more than qualify her for this 
role, and it is why I strongly support 
her nomination. 
If confirmed, Charlotte would also 
become the first openly gay woman to 
serve as a Federal judge west of the 
Mississippi—a powerful affirmation of 
America’s commitment to opportunity 
and equality for all and something that 
is just long overdue. 
So I want to thank the Judiciary 
Committee for sending Charlotte, this 
exceptional nominee, to the floor, and I 
urge Members of both parties to give 
her a strong bipartisan vote of con-
firmation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
NOMINATION OF STEPHANIE DAWKINS DAVIS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today in strong support of Judge 
Stephanie Davis, who is nominated to 
serve on the Sixth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
Judge Davis has spent her entire ca-
reer in Michigan, and we are better for 
it. Judge Davis began work in the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office in the Eastern Dis-
trict of Michigan in 1997. During her 
time there, she served in the office’s 
civil and criminal divisions. She pros-
ecuted fraud, bank robbery, embezzle-
ment, violent crime, public corruption, 
and criminal conspiracies involving 
drug trafficking, as well as money 
laundering. She oversaw community 
and law enforcement initiatives and 
led the office’s diversity efforts. 
In 2016, Judge Davis became a mag-
istrate judge for the U.S. District for 
the Eastern District of Michigan. 
In 2019, with the strong support of 
both 
Senator 
PETERS
and 
myself, 
Judge Davis was nominated by Presi-
dent Trump to serve as U.S. district 
judge for the Eastern District of Michi-
gan. Her confirmation was bipartisan, 
and so was her support in committee 
for this Sixth Circuit nomination. 
Judge Davis has done an outstanding 
job every place she has been serving 
the people of Michigan, and I have no 
doubt that she will continue her strong 
record of public service on the U.S. 
court of appeals. 
I have had the opportunity to get to 
know Judge Davis, and it has really 
been a joy. She is not just an ex-
tremely accomplished jurist, she is 
also a wonderful person, and those 
qualities, no doubt, are needed more 
than ever these days. So it is with 
great confidence that I urge my col-
leagues to support this wonderful nom-
ination. 
Mr. President, I would now ask unan-
imous consent that the Senate recess 
until 2:15 as is part of the schedule. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. STABENOW. I yield the floor.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. On September 23, 
2021, November 30, 2021, and again on 
February 15, 2022, I spoke on this floor 
about the fake Russia Alfa-Bank nar-
rative. That narrative started in 2016. 
It took on a new life when Clinton 
campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann 
met with FBI General Counsel James 
Baker. 
In that meeting, Sussmann provided 
information and data files that alleg-
edly contained evidence of a secret 
communication channel between the 
Trump organization and a Russian 
bank, Alfa-Bank. The evidence was fab-
ricated by the Clinton campaign. The 
allegations about the Trump organiza-
tion being linked with a Russian bank 
were false. Of note, Sussmann also pro-
vided Baker information Fusion GPS 
gave him as part of their work for the 
Clinton campaign. This was an all- 
hands-on-deck strategy to destroy the 
Trump Presidency and the campaign. 
With the ongoing Sussmann trial 
now underway here in DC, the false 
Alfa-Bank narrative is more relevant 
now than ever before. I want to tell 
you why. 
A mere several days after the meet-
ing with James Baker, the FBI opened 
a full investigation on September 23, 
2016. Around that time, an FBI agent 
working on cyber matters reviewed the 
information provided by Sussmann. 
That agent said: 
We did not agree with the conclusion . . . 
that this represented a secret communica-
tion channel. 
He also stated that ‘‘whoever had 
written that paper had jumped to some 
conclusions that were not supported by 
the data’’ and that ‘‘the methodology 
they chose was questionable to me.’’ 
Here is the kicker: 
I did not feel that they were objective in 
the conclusions that they came to. The as-
sumption that you would have to make was 
so far-reaching that it just didn’t make 
sense. 
So last Friday, in a courtroom, 
Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton’s cam-
paign manager, testified that Hillary 
Clinton was asked about the plan to 
share this fake information with the 
media. Hillary Clinton approved that 
plan. Jake Sullivan was involved in 
that decision as well. He is, of course, 
as we know, President Biden’s National 
Security Advisor. 
The Clinton campaign fabricated evi-
dence trying to connect Trump to Rus-
sia. They fed it to the media to start a 
yearslong wildfire of false allegations. 
They fed it to the FBI to trigger a Fed-
eral investigation into their opposing 
candidate. 
I said it before and will say it again: 
The Clinton campaign was the con-
spiracy, and it was a big bag of dirty 
tricks. 
This false Alfa-Bank information 
eventually landed with the media out-
let Slate, which ran an article on Octo-
ber 31, 2016. After that article, Sul-
livan, the now National Security Advi-
sor, issued his now-infamous tweet: 
‘‘This could be the most direct link yet 
between Donald Trump and Moscow.’’ 
Hillary Clinton also tweeted: ‘‘Com-
puter scientists have apparently uncov-
ered a covert server linking the Trump 
Organization 
to 
a 
Russian-based 
bank.’’ 
Now, they weren’t the only ones 
pleased with this fake news. On Octo-
ber 13, 2020, Senator JOHNSON and I 
wrote a letter to the FBI where we 
made public texts between Andrew 
McCabe and Lisa Page. 
Page says to McCabe: 
And the Alfa-Bank story is in Slate. 
McCabe’s reply: 
Awesome. 
The FBI’s excitement didn’t end 
there. This week, Durham’s prosecu-
tors introduced a message between FBI 
agents that said: 
People on the 7th floor to include Director 
are fired up about this server. 
Now, they—meaning the FBI seventh 
floor people—were ‘‘fired up’’ about 
fake information, which is just ter-
rible. The FBI’s job is really to get 
fired up about fake information? It is 
more than that, however; it is a gut- 
wrenching attack on our system of 
government. 
Now, there is another data point that 
I want to share. Durham recently re-
leased notes from a March 6, 2017, 
meeting between the Justice Depart-
ment and FBI officials. In that meet-
ing, they discussed predication and 
Crossfire Hurricane issues. This meet-
ing was 2 weeks before then-Director 
Comey publicly announced his inves-
tigation into Trump. 
On that very day, March 6, 2017, I 
wrote a letter to Comey asking ques-
tions about the Steele dossier. My 
press release for that letter is titled 
‘‘FBI plan to pay ex-spy for Trump 
intel during campaign sparks questions 
of Obama administration’s use of fed-
eral authorities for political gain.’’ 
That was from March 6, 2017. Now, in 
May of 2022, that title just about sums 
up Crossfire Hurricane as best as it can 
be described. 
Now, in closing, I would like to make 
a few notes with respect to predication.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2648 
May 24, 2022 
The September 23, 2016, FBI elec-
tronic communication opened a full in-
vestigation into the Alfa-Bank allega-
tions, but let’s unpack the first few 
lines from that document. 
The FBI received a referral of information 
from the US Department of Justice. 
The Department of Justice provided the 
FBI with a white paper that was produced by 
an anonymous third party. 
Well, the information didn’t come 
from the Department of Justice; it 
came from Sussmann and the Clinton 
campaign—hardly an anonymous third 
party since Sussmann himself showed 
up at the door. By wording it this way, 
the document almost blesses this so- 
called white paper. Mind you, the white 
paper is the false Alfa-Bank informa-
tion. By the looks of it, this FBI docu-
ment contains false information. 
I fear these recent developments are 
just the tip of the iceberg. The FBI’s 
exposure to false information and actu-
ally using that false information for in-
vestigative purposes wreaks of a polit-
ical vendetta. It points to a ‘‘get 
Trump at all costs’’ attitude. 
Whether Sussmann is convicted or 
not, the evidence introduced by Dur-
ham shows serious government mis-
conduct—misconduct by the Federal 
Government of the United States of 
America. 
Special 
Counsel 
Durham 
can’t let government misconduct go 
unpunished. 
I yield the floor.

S2649 
May 24, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, what is 
the current threat of nuclear annihila-
tion? 
The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists’ 
Doomsday Clock measures how close 
humanity and the planet is to destruc-
tion. The answer is: 100 seconds. That 
is tied for the closest we have ever been 
to planetary ruin since the clock start-
ed in 1947. 
Recent nuclear events are likely to 
turn the dial even further. The size, di-
versity, and lethality of North Korea’s 
weapons continue to grow, as does its 
threat to our allies in the region. 
North Korea’s Kim Jong Un has fired 
more than a dozen missiles this year. 
Preparations are being made for an-
other nuclear test. 
Iran is just weeks away from acquir-
ing a nuclear weapon, the tragic con-
sequence of Donald Trump blowing up 
the Iran nuclear deal that President 
Biden is now trying to stitch back to-
gether. 
In Xinjiang, the same province where 
China has constructed forced labor 
camps, more than 100 domes, likely 
housing missile silos, dot the land-
scape. The Pentagon says these sites 
are part of the evidence behind China’s 
quest to double its nuclear forces in 
the next 5 years. 
Belarus’s 
authoritarian 
leader 
Lukashenka has made a deal with the 
devil, Vladimir Putin, to stay in power. 
Part of the price for Putin’s lifeline 
was a demand that Lukashenka amend 
the Belarus Constitution to allow for 
the 
placement 
of 
Russian 
nuclear 
weapons on its territory, further taunt-
ing Ukraine and all of Europe with ex-
istential ruin. 
European leaders are readying the 
distribution of iodine tablets in the 
event of mushroom cloud drifts over-
head. The continent’s residents are 
building fallout shelters right now. 
It should come as no surprise then 
that in a recent poll, 70 percent of 
Americans said they fear that Putin 
will use nuclear weapons in the war in 
Ukraine. These global fears are well- 
founded. We fought over the course of 
decades 
to 
make 
nuclear 
weapons 
taboo, but they are making a big come-
back. In January, the five nuclear 
weapons States of the Nonproliferation 
Treaty affirmed that ‘‘a nuclear war 
can never be won and must never be 
fought.’’ But actions speak louder than 
words, and the actions of Russia in 
Ukraine, the hundreds of missile silos 
taking form in China, and the $51 bil-
lion the United States is set to spend 
on nuclear weapons this year alone tell 
us that nuclear weapons are still very 
much in vogue. 
The Doomsday Clock was created at 
the start of the nuclear age, and in the 
past 75 years, the minute hand has 
fluctuated. It has inched closer to mid-
night with the Soviet Union’s first nu-
clear weapons test, India’s ‘‘Smiling 
Buddha’’ 
test, 
and 
more 
recently, 
President Trump’s threats of ‘‘fire and 
fury’’ against Kim Jong Un. 
When the destructive power of nu-
clear weapons has been curbed, the 
clock has receded from midnight. Ken-
nedy and Khrushchev answered the 
Cuban Missile Crisis by banning atmos-
pheric and undersea nuclear tests; 
Bush and Gorbachev retired thousands 
of nuclear weapons made obsolete by 
the fall of the Iron Curtain; and Obama 
locked down nuclear material around 
the globe, keeping it out of the hands 
of terrorists. 
I fear that we are seeing echoes of 
the darkest days of the Cold War—a 
time marked by fear and distrust of an 
adversary’s true intentions; a time 
when the gold-plated defense establish-
ment plowed ahead with new capabili-
ties without any consideration of how 
proliferation begets proliferation; a 
time when the myth of a ‘‘bomber and 
missile gap’’ with the former Soviet 
Union spurred an arms race that 
brought us to the brink. 
Thankfully, 
President 
Biden 
has 
taken some steps to crank the minute 
hand 
back 
from 
midnight. 
While 
Trump was intent on dissolving the 
New START treaty with Russia, Presi-
dent Biden saved it in his first days in 
office. The treaty’s value, especially in 
the context of Russia’s war in Ukraine, 
cannot be overstated. The treaty puts 
our eyes on Russia’s strategic forces so 
we can be confident in distinguishing 
between Putin’s nuclear bluster and ac-
tions that should legitimately raise the 
alarm. 
But the New START treaty is not 
enough. Putin’s provocations about nu-
clear escalation, coupled with his bran-
dishing of battlefield nuclear weapons, 
highlight our need to negotiate new 
systems into a future treaty or agree-
ment with Russia. Putin’s invasion of 
Ukraine threw a wrench into progress 
in the U.S.-Russia strategic dialogue, 
but when the moment arrives, we need 
to restart these discussions, and we 
need to be bold. 
The use of nuclear weapons as coer-
cive tools means it is essential that we 
do not welcome any new members to 
the nuclear weapons club. President 
Trump failed us by creating a mine-
field of obstacles against cleanly reen-
tering the Iran nuclear deal, but Presi-
dent Biden knows that the alternative 
to reentry is far worse: We will see 
more enrichment, more proxy attacks, 
and risk a direct war with Iran versus 
the United States. 
We must also hold our partners to 
the same verification standard as we 
hold Iran. Saudi Arabia must come 
clean about its illicit nuclear and mis-
sile cooperation with China. We should 
insist that Saudi Arabia adopt the Ad-
ditional Protocol to its International 
Atomic Energy Agency Comprehensive 
Safeguards Agreement so that we can 
be sure that any future nuclear pro-
gram turns out peaceful megawatts, 
not megatons; so that it is an elec-
tricity program and not a nuclear 
weapons program. 
Kim 
Jong 
Un’s 
recent 
missile 
launches show that we ignore the 
North Korean leader at our own risk. 
In consultation with our allies, we need 
to break the endless cycle we have 
seen: a provocation from the North, 
followed by sanctions, then another 
provocation, sparking a fresh round of 
sanctions. Our policy is stuck in an 
endless loop of nuclear Groundhog Day. 
It is time to concede that a leader like 
Kim Jong Un, who is willing to divert 
resources away from his starving peo-
ple in order to strengthen his weapons 
of mass destruction program, cannot be 
coerced to disarm by piling on sanc-
tions alone. While the denuclearization 
of North Korea is a worthy long-term 
goal, we have to humble ourselves to 
pursue the art of the possible—incre-
mental steps that reduce the threat of 
war on the Korean Peninsula. 
In facing all of these challenges, we 
cannot continue to preach temperance 
from a barstool. As the leader of the 
only country to have used nuclear 
weapons in a conflict, we can’t afford 
to take a back seat when it comes to 
reducing nuclear risks. The President 
must use his position to send the mes-
sage that responsible nuclear weapons 
powers don’t roll out new weapons sys-
tems in military parades; they sit down 
in good-faith negotiations to reduce 
the sizes and uses of their nuclear de-
terrents—and that must include China. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has set 
back the nonproliferation regime, but 
it also creates an opportunity for 
President Biden to challenge China’s 
Xi to join him in reassuring a rattled 
world that firing on nuclear reactors is 
off limits, that threatening countries 
with existential weapons is unaccept-
able, and to show the world that the in-
evitability of a ‘‘Sputnik moment’’ 
with China does not have to come to 
pass. Our two countries may disagree 
on a lot, but we can embrace the orga-
nizing principle that the only way to 
win an arms race is not to run in one. 
For instance, we are concerned about 
China’s development of maneuverable 
hypersonic systems and its plans to ex-
pand its ICBM force, but Pentagon 
leaders admit that Beijing’s concerns 
about advances in U.S. missile defenses 
are partly the impetus for that build-
up. We are concerned that China may 
be drifting away from its no-first-use 
doctrine, but both the United States 
and Russia explicitly allow for the use 
of nuclear weapons in response to a 
nonnuclear attack. We fear that China 
may use new civilian nuclear reactors 
to churn out massive amounts of sepa-
rated plutonium for bombs, but other 
countries in the region also have the 
capacity to divert fissile material from 
a peaceful to a nonpeaceful program. 
If President Biden can get Xi to the 
negotiating table, we have a chance to 
shape an alternative future to the inev-
itable doom that the Pentagon has 
previewed—one that does not see the 
United States and China joining Russia 
in pursuit of new innovative, more le-
thal ways to kill one another; one that 
instead 
negotiates 
near-term 
con-
fidence-building measures to reduce

nuclear risks with China and that can 
ultimately lead to the conclusion of 
formal arms control agreements be-
tween our countries. The United States 
cannot do it alone, but we can break 
the cycle of nuclear escalation and se-
cure a future wherein the fate of mil-
lions no longer hangs on the whims and 
judgments of fallible leaders or the 
military-industrial complex. 
We need President Biden to outline 
that bold action plan that draws inspi-
ration from our better angels, not from 
the unhinged policies of nuclear weap-
ons overkill that Stanley Kubrick lam-
pooned in ‘‘Dr. Strangelove.’’ 
In my book ‘‘Nuclear Peril: The Poli-
tics of Proliferation,’’ written in 1983, I 
wrote: 
Nuclear proliferation is a problem too long 
ignored. Now, before it is too late, the public 
must draw the line. The stakes are too high. 
The public clearly understands that 
the stakes for our planet have never 
been higher, but it is not too late, not 
yet. Once the clock hits midnight, 
though, our time is up. It is time for 
action, not rhetoric. This issue is one 
that can no longer be ignored. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
the Biden administration has made a 
name for itself in attacking the very 
institutions that they were sworn to 
protect. If you look at what is hap-
pening outside Washington right now, 
you can see the ripple effects of this in-
stitutional sabotage. There is inflation; 
there are shortages; there is crime; and 
there are drugs flooding our commu-
nities. 
This weekend, I was chatting with 
one of my politically independent- 
minded friends back home, and here is 
what she told me. 
She said: 
Everything the Democrats are doing is 
making my life harder. It makes things 
worse. 
Last Tuesday, I held a telephone 
townhall with a few thousand Ten-
nesseans, and they told me the same 
thing. 
I spoke to a dad from Chattanooga, 
and something he said really struck 
me. He was telling me about how wor-
ried he was about his children’s fu-
tures. He said the only common thread 
he can see tying all of this together is 
suffering. 
Think about that. Here is a dad—a 
dad—who is looking at the actions of 
the Democrat-controlled House, Sen-
ate, and White House, and to him, he is 
perceiving the intent as being to inflict 
suffering. 
He asked me what the goal was of all 
of this—referring, of course, to Biden’s 
agenda. He couldn’t figure it out, and I 
really don’t blame him. No reasonable 
person can look at what the Biden ad-
ministration has done and say that 
they feel like the administration has 
our best interests at heart or that they 
have a vision for the future of the 
country. What they do have is an agen-
da, a ‘‘to do’’ list, and it seems some-
times they struggle with that. 
To Tennesseans, this government, 
under this administration, with this 
leadership, is all broken. It is broken. 
Nowhere has this been more pro-
nounced than in President Biden’s re-
fusal to support law enforcement, both 
down on the border and in our local 
communities. 
Since day one, the President has 
done everything in his power to sabo-
tage the tens of thousands of people 
the Department of Homeland Security 
employs to secure the homeland. He 
has done this knowing full well that 
international criminal organizations, 
terrorists, and cartels are taking ad-
vantage of his lack of action. In fact, 
business has never been better for the 
drug dealers and the human traf-
fickers. At times, they are raking in as 
much as $100 million a week. That is 
right. Who is profiting? It is the cartels 
that are pushing drugs, that are push-
ing fentanyl, that are pushing gangs, 
that are pushing sex trafficking; the 
cartels that have turned themselves 
into global organizations, bringing in 
people last year from 160 different 
countries to our southern border. To do 
what? It is to enter illegally, to claim 
asylum, to ask the U.S. taxpayer to 
finish the journey for them to wherever 
they are wanting to go. This is what 
the people are seeing. 
Now take a look at what is hap-
pening in our own backyard, if you 
will. In 2021, almost 108,000 Americans 
died from drug overdoses. About 4,000 
of these were Tennesseans—all tragic 
losses. Law enforcement in Benton 
County, TN, told me recently that 
about 80 percent of the drugs they seize 
contain fentanyl, which, as we all 
know, is deadly even in very small 
amounts. Ask any law enforcement of-
ficer where these drugs are coming 
from, and they will tell you that the 
majority of this is coming across the 
southern border. The cartel mules are 
smuggling it right across that border. 
Our Border Patrol is overworked; 
they are underfunded; they are under-
staffed; they are working overtime. 
They are doing their best, but they 
can’t get it all. They look at the sur-
veillance cameras. They see the ‘‘got- 
aways.’’ They know that they are com-
ing. 
If the Biden administration abandons 
their title 42 authority at some point 
in the future, it is going to get worse. 
We will have the equivalent of the pop-
ulation of a small town in Tennessee 
coming right across that border. 
In Tennessee, we have got 345 towns, 
and 90 percent of those are 18,000 in 
population or fewer. When you look at 
Connecticut, you have got 215 towns, 
and 87 percent of those are—you have 
got it—18,000 or fewer in population. If 
you look at the State of Maryland, 
there are 536 towns, and 458 of those are 
18,000 or fewer in population. That is 
85.4 percent. Now think about that 
number of people crossing the border 
every single day, and all that the traf-
fickers—the 
drug 
traffickers, 
the 
human traffickers—and all of the gangs 
have to do is blend in. Come on in. 
I would like to say, until the Biden 
administration wises up and secures 
the border, every town will be a border 
town, and every State will be a border 
State. 
The problems associated with drugs 
and criminal activity don’t stay in New 
Mexico or Arizona or Texas or Cali-
fornia. They bleed into the rest of the 
country and into the hands of local law 
enforcement. They have enough to be 
dealing with. 
Here are some stats for you. In 2021, 
homicides in U.S. cities reached a near- 
record high. The number of law en-
forcement officers intentionally killed 
on the job was the highest since 9/11, 
and ambush-style attacks on police in-
creased 115 percent. 
Meanwhile, earlier this year, the 
Biden administration floated the idea 
of using yet another Executive order to 
limit law enforcement’s access to re-
sources and Federal grant money. Be-
tween the ‘‘defund the police’’ move-
ment and this halfhearted support from 
their President, it is no wonder that 
law enforcement officers are resigning 
or quitting or retiring in record num-
bers. 
I would ask the President and Sec-
retary Mayorkas and my Democratic 
colleagues to listen to what those who 
have sworn to protect and serve are 
telling them, because they know what 
the Biden administration needs to do. 
This administration would be well- 
served to keep title 42 until we have a 
plan to replace it. Embrace the ‘‘Re-
main in Mexico’’ policy and do what 
law enforcement has asked for decades: 
build a wall. They need that barrier. 
Give them technology, better tech-
nology, and more officers and agents. 
That is what they need. They continue 
to ask for it. Give them what they need 
to do their job to protect this country. 
As it stands, Democrats have aban-
doned Border Patrol, abandoned local 
law enforcement, and according to my 
friends in Tennessee, they have aban-
doned we, the people. And the people 
are losing faith. They look at the 
White House and they have no idea who 
is in charge. They don’t see their con-
cern for the future reflected in the ac-
tions of the President or his staff who 
repeatedly corrects him. They don’t see 
a vision for America. All they see is a 
to-do list, an agenda, that will fail 
them over and over again because it 
leads to more government control and 
less freedom for we, the people. 
I yield the floor.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, yester-
day, I was in Southern Maryland at the 
Thomas Johnson Bridge. This bridge 
was built in the 1970s. It connects St. 
Mary’s County with Calvert County. 
There are critical facilities that are lo-
cated in this region. I say that because

this is an evacuation route. We have 
Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. We 
have Pax River. We have the Cove 
Point LNG facilities. 
When it was built, a few thousand 
cars traversed the bridge on a daily 
basis. Now over 30,000 cars trasverse 
this bridge. It is not safe. It is a two- 
lane bridge, and it needs to be replaced. 
Major accidents occur on a regular 
basis, causing incredible congestion, as 
well as risking people’s health. 
I was there at the invitation of Sen-
ator VAN HOLLEN. He could not make it 
physically to be there, but he helped 
arrange for a congressional earmark to 
help advance the replacement of this 
bridge. 
I say that because we need to deal 
with traffic safety in this country, and 
replacing unsafe bridges is just one 
part of that program. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration’s 2021 fatality report 
was just recently released, and the 
numbers are shocking. Nearly 43,000 
people lost their lives on our highways 
in 2021. This is the highest number 
since 2005. We are moving in the wrong 
direction on traffic safety. It is the 
largest increase in fatalities since we 
have been keeping the records since 
1975. 
Pedestrians and bicyclists, nearly 
7,500 lost their lives in 2021. And if you 
look at the deaths between 2010 and 
2019, 53,435 people, pedestrians, were 
killed as a result of traffic accidents. 
The impact is disproportionate in com-
munities of color. 
In its report, Dangerous by Design, 
Smart Growth America found that 
‘‘older adults, people of color, and peo-
ple walking in low-income commu-
nities 
are 
disproportionately 
rep-
resented in fatal crashes involving peo-
ple walking—even after controlling for 
differences in population size and walk-
ing rates. The fatality rate in the low-
est income neighborhoods was nearly 
twice that of the middle income census 
tracts . . . and almost three times that 
of higher-income neighborhoods.’’ 
If you have had a friend or a family 
member killed or injured by a roadway 
collision, then the issue of safety is a 
personal one. The reality of the situa-
tion, however, is that this is an issue 
that affects all of us. All safety inci-
dents cause delays and congestion on 
our roads, and these delays are disrup-
tive. They make us late to pick up our 
kids from daycare. We miss important 
meetings. Our levels of anxiety rise as 
we sit in traffic frustrated as our cars 
burn fuel in stop-and-go traffic, send-
ing excess pollution into the air we 
breathe. All of this hurts our wallets, 
our health, and our sense of well-being. 
With new data sources and analytical 
tools, the Center for Advanced Trans-
portation 
Technology, 
‘‘the 
CATT 
Lab,’’ at the University of Maryland 
has been able to quantitate some of the 
other impacts. Using numbers the 
CATT Lab analysts consider as con-
servative for the value of time placed 
on commercial vehicles and the trav-
eling public, they found that there 
were nearly $8 billion in user-delay 
costs due to safety incidents on Na-
tional Highway System roadways in 
2019. 
Safety-related 
incidents 
ac-
counted for over 18 percent of all con-
gestion and over 300 million vehicle 
hours of delay. And this is just on our 
National Highway System, not our 
local roads. 
Imagine if we could get back those 
300 million hours of time to be with our 
families, to be more productive at 
work, to be more creative, and to live 
happier lives. Imagine if we could get 
back the $8 billion. This is something 
that is obviously of concern to every-
one. The worst thing that we could do 
at this critical moment is to be com-
placent, to shrug our shoulders and say 
this is just the price we pay to have 
cars and the so-called freedom that our 
cars provide. 
For those who have lost a loved one 
to a collision, this is an unacceptable 
price, and it should be unacceptable to 
all of us because we can do better and 
we must do better. 
I applaud the Biden administration 
and the Department of Transportation 
for putting forth a National Roadway 
Safety Strategy earlier this year that 
adopts a long-term goal of zero road-
way fatalities. The plan takes a com-
prehensive look at safety and all the 
pieces needed to help us tackle this 
challenge, from safer drivers to safer 
vehicles to more effective after-crash 
care. All these components are nec-
essary. Today, however, I just want to 
focus on our roads. 
Yes, we need individual drivers to do 
their part: to slow down, stay focused, 
to be alert. Yes, we need new tech-
nologies for safer vehicles. This is true, 
but it is not enough. What we need now 
more urgently than ever is better in-
frastructure 
and 
safer 
roadways. 
Therefore, fixing this problem is not 
about halting construction; it is about 
building. 
We need the infrastructure but the 
kind of infrastructure that will provide 
safety. We need better sidewalks, bet-
ter bike paths, and better intersec-
tions. In many places, we need to re-
move the vast expanses of pavement 
that have for so long facilitated speed-
ing and restore the network of neigh-
borhood streets that facilitate connec-
tions and support communities and 
children. 
This is the infrastructure that will be 
better for businesses too. Many com-
munities have found that small busi-
nesses aren’t helped by roads that 
make it easier for cars to speed right 
by. They are helped by safe places for 
customers and employees to walk 
around and spend time. We need the in-
frastructure, but we need the right 
kind of infrastructure. 
This year, we have a historic oppor-
tunity to change course and invest in 
infrastructure we need for stronger 
communities 
and 
safer 
roadways 
through the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law, but we have to be deliberate and 
determined in seizing this opportunity. 
I was proud to be part of the Environ-
ment and Public Works Committee. I 
chair 
the 
Infrastructure 
Sub-
committee. 
We 
worked 
together, 
Democrats and Republicans, to produce 
a bipartisan surface transportation 
bill, a bipartisan WRDA bill—Water 
Resources Development Act. They were 
incorporated into the bipartisan infra-
structure package. I am proud of that 
work. 
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law 
provides several new policy tools and 
funding to help us address safety on 
our roads. I would like to highlight 
three important programs in the infra-
structure law that will play a vital role 
in helping us to change course. 
First, the Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law provides $15.6 billion for the High-
way Safety Improvement Program, 
which is one of our longstanding for-
mula programs whose purpose in stat-
ute is to ‘‘achieve a significant reduc-
tion in traffic fatalities and serious in-
juries on all public roads.’’ These are 
formula funds that go to our States. 
With the enactment of the infra-
structure law, the Highway Safety Im-
provement Program will now incor-
porate a consideration of a safe sys-
tems approach, which aims to protect 
vulnerable road users from the start, 
from the designing of our roads. 
A consortium the Johns Hopkins 
Center for Injury Research Policy con-
vened has highlighted the importance 
of a safe system approach based on a 
wealth 
of 
evidence-based 
research. 
Their report said that a safe systems 
approach ‘‘begins with a commitment 
to eliminate fatalities and serious inju-
ries among all road users, and uses 
thoughtful road and vehicle design to 
minimize crashes that occur when peo-
ple make mistakes and to reduce crash 
forces so that people are less likely to 
be injured when crashes occur. By de-
signing safety into the road system, 
deaths and serious injuries are engi-
neered out.’’ That is what the report 
pointed out. 
Here again, the message is clear—we 
cannot simply wait for all drivers to be 
error-free. We need to design and build 
better roadways. 
Under the new and improved High-
way Safety Improvement Program that 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill will 
deliver, every State is required to com-
plete a vulnerable road user safety as-
sessment to study where and when fa-
talities and serious injuries are occur-
ring, including a demographic break-
down to ensure equity considerations 
are incorporated. States must identify 
projects and strategies to reduce the 
risks 
to 
pedestrians 
and 
cyclists. 
States in which vulnerable users rep-
resent 15 percent or more of all road-
way fatalities must spend 15 percent of 
their Federal Highway Safety Improve-
ment Program dollars on vulnerable 
user safety. 
Based on 2016 to 2018 fatality rates, 28 
States would have to spend at least

$200 million on improvements like side-
walks, bike lanes, crosswalks, and oth-
ers. This is a major step forward to fac-
ing up to the problem and taking ac-
tion to address it. 
The second issue in the Bipartisan 
Infrastructure Practice I want to talk 
about is a major expansion of the 
Transportation Alternatives Program. 
I am particularly proud about this pro-
gram. I authored this program origi-
nally with Senator Cochran but later 
with Senator WICKER. The two of us 
have worked together to connect com-
munities together through pedestrian 
and bicycle paths so that pedestrians 
don’t have to be on highways in order 
to get around their community. 
Transportation Alternatives is such a 
critical program because it supports 
priorities local communities identify 
for projects to make roads safer and 
more accessible. This is one of the few 
programs where our local governments 
make the determinations. 
Transportation 
Alternatives 
have 
funded projects that have improved the 
quality of life in all kinds of commu-
nities across the country in every con-
gressional district, and in big cities 
and in rural areas. The infrastructure 
law increases funding for the Transpor-
tation Alternatives to 10 percent of the 
Surface Transportation Block Grant 
Program, which amounts to $7.2 billion 
over 5 years. The infrastructure law 
also specifies that projects under the 
Safe Routes to School Program are an 
eligible use for funds under the Trans-
portation Alternatives Program. 
Safe Routes Partnership is an organi-
zation that has worked with us on the 
Transportation Alternatives Program. 
It has helped governments implement 
Safe Routes to School initiatives to 
make it safer, more convenient, and 
fun for children to walk and bicycle to 
school. 
In Montgomery County, Maryland, 
crashes involving people walking or 
biking near schools decreased by 25 to 
42 percent after Safe Routes to School 
efforts provided engineering improve-
ments, like better crosswalks and 
signs. And by providing the oppor-
tunity to walk and bike to school, we 
can improve safety and promote health 
and physical activity. Through initia-
tives like Safe Routes to School, the 
Transportation Alternatives Program 
is poised to make a major contribution 
to delivering on local demands to be-
come more walkable, more bike friend-
ly, and safer for all road users. 
Now, the third program I wanted to 
highlight from the infrastructure law 
is Reconnecting Communities, which 
will deliver $1 billion to address an out-
standing equity challenge related to 
our transportation infrastructure. We 
held a hearing about the need for this 
program last year in the Transpor-
tation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Sub-
committee. 
The building of our national highway 
system from the 1950s was, in many 
ways, a great national achievement, a 
major public investment in our infra-
structure that transformed our country 
and that we continue to rely on today; 
but for far too many communities, es-
pecially communities of color, ethnic 
communities, and urban centers, the 
construction of our highways had trau-
matic and destructive impacts. Rather 
than connecting their communities and 
expanding their opportunities, highway 
construction brought demolition, dis-
placement, isolation, and exclusion. I 
consider it a major achievement that 
we finally will have a Federal program 
focused on addressing this harmful leg-
acy. 
My own city of Baltimore struggles 
with these lasting impacts today that 
include unsafe and unhealthy condi-
tions for families trying to navigate 
their city. I specifically refer to the 
Franklin-Mulberry corridor in down-
town Baltimore, where you have a 
highway that was constructed and 
never completed that divided existing 
communities. And that division still 
exists today, making it more difficult 
for people to live in that community. 
The Reconnecting Communities Pro-
gram in the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill will establish a program to im-
prove safety as it also addresses long-
standing inequity in our infrastruc-
ture, and it is a program that is about 
building the right kind of infrastruc-
ture, not just removing barriers. After 
we remove the old infrastructure that 
no longer serves our needs, we need to 
replace it with the kinds of infrastruc-
ture we need more of, such as better 
sidewalks, neighborhood street grids, 
signs and crosswalks, and parks that 
the neighborhood can appreciate and 
grow. 
So we see how the infrastructure law 
provides new opportunities and mul-
tiple programs that can complement 
and reinforce each other to build better 
infrastructure and safer infrastructure. 
I have just highlighted three ways in 
which the bipartisan infrastructure law 
can do this, delivering better and safer 
roads for Americans and bringing down 
the unacceptably high numbers of traf-
fic fatalities and injuries: the new 
Highway 
Safety 
Improvement 
Pro-
gram, 
Transportation 
Alternatives, 
and Reconnecting Communities. This 
list is not exhaustive. The infrastruc-
ture law does even more. 
Just last week, Department of Trans-
portation 
officials 
announced 
the 
availability of $5 billion over 5 years 
for a new program focused on safety es-
tablished by the infrastructure law. 
The law also provides a mandate to up-
date the Manual on Uniform Traffic 
Control Devices to give local govern-
ments more flexibility to implement 
safety measures. 
I could go on and on. The bottom line 
is that we have a lot of work to do, and 
setting this new policy is just the be-
ginning. We need leaders at all levels of 
government to take on this challenge. 
I talked about Transportation Alter-
natives, which will now receive a full 10 
percent of the surface transportation 
block grant funds, but 10 percent is 
just that, 10 percent. We cannot have 10 
percent of our funds working for safer 
roads and 90 percent of our funds work-
ing to make them less safe. We need 
safety prioritized and integrated in all 
of our infrastructure investments. 
I talked about Reconnecting Commu-
nities, a new $1 billion program to re-
move barriers that have harmed and 
isolated neighborhoods from oppor-
tunity, but we cannot have $1 billion 
working to remove these barriers and 
billions and billions more dollars spent 
erecting new barriers. We need to build 
the right kind of infrastructure that 
we need for our future, not continue on 
the same path we have been on in the 
past—the path that has led to 43,000 
deaths in 2021 alone. 
To accept the status quo would be 
the most dangerous and radical course 
of action. Again, I applaud the Depart-
ment of Transportation for announcing 
a new national roadway safety strategy 
in January that thinks through safety 
across all of the Department’s pro-
grams and authorities. 
We need this leadership from the 
Federal level, and the Biden adminis-
tration is providing it. As we imple-
ment the infrastructure law and begin 
to make generational investments to 
improve our Nation’s infrastructure, 
we will need all levels of government 
working together. The challenge of our 
dangerous roads requires all of us to 
pay attention, but the benefits of in-
vesting to make our transportation 
network safer cannot be understated. If 
we use the infrastructure law to its 
greatest potential with respect to safe-
ty, we will have a stronger, more pro-
ductive economy and a healthier, more 
just America. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk 
will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in April, 
more than 234,000 migrants were appre-
hended at the southern border. This is 
an alarming number, and it is the high-
est monthly total in 22 years. 
We have a humanitarian, public 
health, and national security crisis 
happening at the border. The Depart-
ment of Homeland Security is bracing 
for an even bigger surge in the weeks 
and months to come, with the possi-
bility—the estimates of 18,000 new peo-
ple showing up every single day. 
The Biden administration continues 
to be absent in this crisis, and instead 
of offering constructive policies, they 
are removing ones that are helping pre-
vent even more people from entering 
our country. 
Last week, the court made the deci-
sion to require title 42 to remain in 
place. The reality of ending it would

create an even greater border emer-
gency. Yet the Biden administration is 
appealing the court’s decision. 
A 
recent 
POLITICO-Harvard 
poll 
found that 55 percent of Americans op-
pose ending this title 42 prohibition. 
President Biden and Vice President 
HARRIS have refused to take any lead-
ership on this issue. Not only have they 
attempted to repeal title 42; President 
Biden’s first order of business after 
taking office was to repeal nearly 
every immigration policy of the pre-
vious administration. 
Repealing policies like title 42 with-
out any plan of action will leave our 
border agents with an unmanageable 
task of apprehending, vetting, and doc-
umenting hundreds of thousands of mi-
grants while trying to stop drug and 
human trafficking. 
In my conversations with border 
agents, they describe just how hard a 
task they have. The cartels have 
learned that flooding the border with 
migrants provides a distraction that 
affords them a better chance of suc-
cessfully bringing drugs across the bor-
der. It is no wonder that fentanyl sei-
zures at the southern border increased 
48 percent in April 2022 from the pre-
vious year of April 2021. 
Our border agents and officers are 
being asked to be caretakers, law en-
forcement 
officers, 
medical 
profes-
sionals, and so much more. They have 
a tireless and thankless job. I visited 
the border in April of last year to meet 
with the Border Patrol, the DEA, and 
the FBI and to hear firsthand about 
how the crisis affected their oper-
ations. They shared how handling a 
large surge of migrants has made it ex-
tremely challenging to carry out their 
mission to stop and disrupt transi-
tional 
criminal 
organizations 
from 
drug trafficking. 
These 
agents 
were 
sounding 
the 
alarm in April of 2021 when border en-
counters totaled 178,000. Now, compare 
that to the 234,000 migrants crossing 
the border in April of this year. 
I have consistently worked to in-
crease resources to our Border Patrol 
agents. We must prioritize additional 
border security measures that include 
a physical barrier and investments in 
new technologies. We must also enforce 
our immigration laws and work to re-
form our immigration system so that 
we reward those who follow the law 
and disincentivize illegal crossings. 
While title 42 will remain for now, 
the Biden administration plans to con-
tinue to fight this ruling and has al-
most zero constructive plans to help 
improve the crisis at the southern bor-
der. 
One thing is for certain, our Border 
Patrol agents are doing an incredible 
job. And I want them to know they are 
supported in the U.S. Senate, and we 
thank them for their service our Na-
tion. 
RECOGNIZING C.W. PORUBSKY GROCERY AND 
MEATS 
Mr. President, today I recognize a 
Kansas business that has served To-
peka, our State capital city, for more 
than 75 years with hot bowls of chili, 
cold-cut sandwiches, spicy pickles, and 
warm conversations. 
To 
someone 
from 
out 
of 
town, 
Porubsky’s Grocery and Meats doesn’t 
seem like much, but to railroad work-
ers, Topeka locals, and legislators from 
the 
statehouse 
who 
frequent 
Porubsky’s, it was the best place in 
town to grab a delicious meal and re-
ceive a friendly welcome. 
Opened in 1947 by Katie Porubsky and 
her 
son 
Charlie 
Porubsky, 
C.W. 
Porubsky Grocery and Meats was an 
iconic restaurant in Topeka and had 
fans around the country. While the gro-
cery store portion was originally the 
driving force behind the business, it is 
best known for being a spot to meet 
folks for lunch. 
Gourmet magazine summed it up as 
well as anyone when it stated that 
‘‘Porubsky’s is not just a place to eat. 
It is a destination in itself.’’ Charlie 
Porubsky’s sons, Matthew, Charlie Jr., 
and Mark, alongside the Porubsky 
daughters, Cecelia Pierson and Teresa 
Thomas, have kept this business alive 
and have made their homes in Topeka. 
Over the years, the restaurant has 
developed a reputation of having some 
of the most delicious chili in the area. 
The start of chili season is a day their 
loyal customers look forward to year 
in and year out. 
My 
personal 
experience 
with 
Porubsky’s dates back to my time in 
the Kansas Legislature. Several of my 
fellow legislators and I would make the 
trek to Porubsky’s during legislative 
breaks. Meeting from January through 
June meant that we had at least 3 full 
months to truly enjoy Porubsky’s hot 
pickles and spicy chili. With meats and 
cheese trays displayed, the restaurant 
was a warm respite from the cold and a 
welcome break from our political and 
governmental dealings. 
Even today, as I travel across Kan-
sas, I have a habit of altering my plans 
so that I can have a ham salad sand-
wich with three slices of cheese and a 
cold Coke at Porubsky’s and enjoy the 
warm family hospitality. When my 
flight from DC to Kansas at the end of 
the week lands early, I have the 
chance, during that 2-hour drive home, 
to make the trek across the Kansas 
River and up to North Topeka to go to 
Porubsky’s. And I will find wonderful 
people, great food, and a sense that I 
am home, where all the talk is not 
about politics and not all the Wash-
ington, DC, insider conversation; it 
just feels like you are around real peo-
ple and real Kansans. 
While Porubsky’s and many family- 
owned establishments like it lack the 
bells and whistles of nationwide chains, 
the underlying quality that truly mat-
ters is the collection of people it takes 
to make it work. The value of places 
like Porubsky’s can’t be measured in 
economic profits or Yelp reviews. What 
the Porubsky family has been serving 
up for decades is more than just tasty 
sandwiches; it is a place where you can 
go to know people and to be known— 
and known so well that your sandwich 
is made before you even make it to the 
counter to order it. 
Squeezing into a seat at the res-
taurant, it doesn’t matter if you are a 
Republican or a Democrat. It doesn’t 
matter where you come from. At places 
like Porubsky’s, everyone is welcome. 
While I am sad to see Porubsky’s 
close their doors after decades—75 
years—of service, the Porubsky family 
themselves and their famous grocery 
will never be forgotten. I knew Charlie 
and Cecelia’s mom and dad, and I know 
Charlie and Cecelia well today. I thank 
them for being such good friends and 
for looking after my well-being and 
that of thousands of other customers 
over so many years. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today 
marks exactly 3 months since Russia 
began its war on Ukraine. I have come 
to the Senate floor for what is now the 
13th straight week since that time 
while the Senate has been in session to 
talk about this unprovoked, illegal, 
and brutal war that they are waging on 
our ally Ukraine, a democratic and 
sovereign country. 
Since I spoke last week, we had a 
very important development. At the 
end of last week, the Senate came to-
gether in a strong bipartisan vote to 
pass what is called the supplemental 
funding bill for Ukraine. The vote was 
86 to 11. It passed the House the week 
prior with a similar strong bipartisan 
vote. Congress, in this legislation, ac-
tually went above what the President 
had requested. He initially requested 
$33 billion and Congress decided to pro-
vide $40 billion to ensure that the 
Ukrainians had the funding they need-
ed through this fall. 
In combination with the help from 
about 40 different countries around the 
world, Ukrainians now have the ammu-
nition and weapons, as well as the hu-
manitarian and economic support they 
need to survive and also to continue 
their fight for the next several months. 
Importantly, the supplemental spend-
ing bill will replenish what is called 
the Presidential Drawdown Authority. 
It was depleted. That is the authority 
that lets us very quickly transfer 
weapons from our own surpluses to the 
Ukrainians and it has been very effec-
tive. The legislation raised the Presi-
dential Drawdown Authority cap to $11 
million, $3 billion over the President’s 
request. Again, the notion is this is 
going to be needed. 
The bill also includes $6 billion for 
what is called the Ukraine Security As-
sistance Initiative, a program I first 
authored 
in 
2015 
to 
enhance 
the 
Ukrainian military’s ability to fight 
off Russian aggression. When we start-
ed that program, Russia was only in 
this part of Ukraine and the line of 
contact was here in eastern Ukraine. 
Here are a couple of maps that show 
the progress that has been made in

pushing back as Russia has invaded 
Ukraine starting on February 24. All 
this area here that is in blue was con-
trolled by Russia at one point, as was 
this lighter red area. The darker red 
area was what Russia took back in 2014 
after Ukraine chose to look to the West 
rather than to Russia for alliance and 
support. 
This is what they took in 2014. Then 
they came in on February 24 with the 
hope of taking the entire country, and 
they did control this territory. Every-
thing you see in blue has been pushed 
back. It is no longer Russian-held terri-
tory. It is now back in Ukrainian 
hands. So this is the map of today. 
There is progress being made around 
Kharkiv. This is a beautiful city in this 
part of Ukraine. The blue you see here 
is where Ukrainian military have re-
cently 
pushed 
back 
the 
Russian 
forces—in one case, right up to the 
Russian border. You also see the same 
here in the eastern and southern—more 
southern parts of Ukraine, where some 
progress has been made. 
But there is fierce fighting all in this 
region. And, in fact, recently, you can 
see where the Russians have made 
some progress in trying to cut off some 
of the Ukrainian troops. Initially, they 
had hoped to make a bridge here to cut 
off troops in this area. Thousands of 
them now are pushing through right 
here and making some progress. 
It is a hot war, and the Ukrainians 
are desperate to have enough ammuni-
tion to continue to fight that war to 
protect their homeland and to have 
better weapons to be able to push back 
against Russia. 
The end of this war has to be that 
Russia is pushed out of Ukraine. That 
has to be our objective. It is certainly 
one that the Ukrainians share. 
The successes against Russia in the 
battlefield are a testament to the brav-
ery and the effectiveness of Ukrainians 
who are fighting to defend their free-
dom, fighting to defend their families, 
defend their homeland. 
But it is also a success that is due to 
the effectiveness of our help, and par-
ticularly, the Ukraine Security Initia-
tive over the past 7 years, especially 
the training element of it. It was 
money well spent by U.S. taxpayers to 
ensure that—along with other NATO 
countries who provided funding for 
this, as well—that there was a training 
component to ensure the military 
would be more effective. And you can 
see 
the 
results 
of 
it. 
They 
are 
outgunned, outnumbered, and yet have 
been able to push Russia out of all this 
part of Ukraine and are making some 
progress in these areas. 
The supplemental spending bill I 
talked about also includes $4 billion in 
foreign military financing to allow 
Ukraine to get American-made weap-
ons and equipment through a lend- 
lease-type program. 
Importantly, the supplemental also 
includes $3.9 billion to support en-
hanced U.S. troop deployments to Eu-
rope. That is critical to me because it 
has never been more important than 
now to ensure that we have the troops 
we need along the border here to be 
able to ensure Russia knows that if 
they go beyond Ukraine, we will re-
spond 
and 
respond 
forcefully 
as 
NATO—all 30 countries of NATO. So we 
have reinforced our troops’ presence in 
Eastern Europe, places like Poland, 
places like Slovakia, Romania, and 
around the region to be able to ensure 
that our article 5 agreement under 
NATO—which is a mutual defense com-
mitment—can be kept. 
Again, it is not just us, but it is all 
the members of NATO. If Russians 
make a further mistake and do what 
President 
Putin 
has 
talked 
about 
doing—going to places like the Baltics, 
Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia—NATO will 
be there, and that should be a big de-
terrent. Of course, this legislation, the 
supplemental, was not inexpensive. 
Forty billion dollars is a lot of money. 
It has to be subject to appropriate safe-
guards for transparency and account-
ability. 
Last week, I spoke about many of 
these safeguards that some of us helped 
get into the legislation, including the 
critical role that Congress will play in 
providing regular oversight over these 
funds. I expect the administration to 
keep Congress promptly informed of 
how it intends to spend this money as 
required by this law. 
Effective oversight of Ukraine will 
also require a strong diplomatic pres-
ence on the ground. We have people 
there watching how the money is being 
spent and can report back. I am pleased 
that the administration heeded the 
Senate’s call to reopen our embassy in 
Kyiv last Sunday. Kyiv is the capital of 
Ukraine, here in the middle of Ukraine. 
It now has a U.S. embassy presence. 
The officials at the embassy were here 
in Poland. Some have gone to Lviv in 
the last few weeks, but now, as of this 
last week, we are back in Kyiv and we 
are open for business. 
By the way, the same day the em-
bassy opened, we reported out the new 
ambassador nominee for Ukraine. We 
haven’t had an ambassador there for 
way too long—about a year and a half 
or so. And we actually then voted on 
her on the Senate floor—it may be the 
fastest nomination ever through this 
place. That is very important. We 
unanimously confirmed Bridget Brink 
to be the Ambassador. She was the Am-
bassador to Slovakia. She has been in 
Ukraine before as a Foreign Service Of-
ficer. I think she is a very good choice. 
She is leaving her post in Slovakia and 
going right into Ukraine. Our diplo-
matic presence there is once again 
going to be in a strong position and, 
therefore, telling the rest of the world 
that the United States is here and here 
to stay. 
Now that Congress has provided this 
$40 billion to support Ukraine and to 
support our troops in the area, it is up 
to the administration to ensure that it 
is used effectively, particularly with 
regard to the military assistance. 
I encourage the administration to 
use these funds in accordance with the 
needs on the ground in Ukraine. We 
have to be sure that we are giving 
them what they actually need. We have 
to listen to the Ukrainians who are 
fighting on the front lines. To me, this 
would include, as an example, what is 
called the mobile Multiple Launch 
Rocket Systems, or MLRS, that they 
are asking for. This enables them and 
Ukraine to sit back a little further and 
not be subject to shelling from the 
Russian forces, and yet to provide dam-
age to some of the artillery Russia is 
using against these cities—flattening 
these beautiful cities and killing so 
many civilians. 
We cannot delude ourselves into 
thinking if we stop providing certain 
weapons systems like the MLRS, that 
somehow we will, therefore, not be pro-
voking 
Russia 
and 
that 
President 
Putin will gracefully acknowledge that 
gesture and cease his assault or lessen 
his assault on Ukraine. That is not 
going to happen. Let me be clear. Rus-
sia’s unprovoked and brutal invasion of 
a sovereign and democratic Ukraine is 
the provocation here; not us, not the 
military assistance we are providing 
Ukraine just to be able to defend their 
homeland and their families. 
President Biden must be forward- 
leaning in providing military assist-
ance to the Ukrainians that they need 
and make it clear that we are in this 
conflict until it ends—until Russian 
troops leave, until the bombardments 
end. If President Putin senses weak-
ness or equivocation on our part or the 
part of our allies, he will intensify his 
attacks on Ukraine. 
I want to speak for a moment about 
the broader situation in Europe. Back 
in 2014, Ukraine made this decision to 
ally with us, with Europe, with free-
dom, with democracy, rather than Rus-
sia and authoritarianism and tyranny. 
Russia did not take that well. Again, 
that is when they annexed Crimea here 
and parts of the Donbas, Luhansk, and 
Donetsk. When they did that, the reac-
tion 
of 
the 
West 
was, 
frankly, 
underwhelming. When President Putin 
launched 
this 
war—comprehensive 
war—on February 24, he probably ex-
pected the same feckless response. The 
global community, when these two 
happened, really did not respond as 
forcefully as we should have. Instead of 
getting the same response that he ex-
pected, President Putin initiated an 
abrupt reversal, particularly in Euro-
pean diplomacy and military policy. 
Previously, Europe prioritized avoid-
ing any conflict with Russia by fol-
lowing practices that they believed 
would be seen by the Kremlin as 
nonconfrontational. The European and 
the global approach, including the U.S. 
approach, 
to 
Russia 
and 
Ukraine 
changed when this unjustified and bru-
tal assault began. 
Just as President Putin has weak-
ened 
Russia’s 
position 
with 
his 
unprovoked invasion, the NATO alli-
ance that he tried to undermine has

May 24, 2022 
only grown stronger. In fact, two new 
countries, Finland and Sweden, have 
now officially applied for the 30-mem-
ber-strong NATO membership. 
In the aftermath of Russia’s inva-
sion, public support for joining NATO 
skyrocketed in Finland and Sweden. 
This is especially remarkable in Swe-
den, whose policy of neutrality dates 
all the way back to the Napoleonic 
Wars, well before World War II. But as 
President Putin has indiscriminately 
killed innocent men, women, and chil-
dren in Ukraine and flattened some of 
the most beautiful cities, the Finnish 
and Swedish people have seen the ben-
efit of NATO as a security blanket for 
them too. 
I am glad Finland and Sweden ap-
plied to join NATO. It is the world’s 
most successful military alliance in 
history. Each of these two countries 
has an impressive military and a com-
mitment to higher defense spending, so 
they have a lot of value to add to the 
NATO alliance. Their membership will 
further tilt the power base in Europe in 
NATO’s favor and that is good for 
peace and tranquility. It is good for the 
United States, and it is good for our al-
lies. 
I was pleased that President Biden 
hosted the leaders of both those coun-
tries last week and that Leader MCCON-
NELL also visited Finland and Sweden 
when he was overseas just a couple of 
weeks ago. I join the leader in calling 
for the Senate to approve their mem-
bership bids to NATO before the Au-
gust recess. Let’s make the United 
States the first country to approve 
their applications for NATO member-
ship. 
I understand that all 30 of our NATO 
allies have been supportive, with one 
exception, 
Turkey. 
They 
have 
ex-
pressed concerns about Finland and 
Sweden joining the alliance for issues 
unrelated to NATO, in my view. I trust 
these issues can be worked out among 
the three countries and encourage the 
administration to take a lead in mov-
ing this application forward. Joining 
NATO is a serious matter of war and 
peace. No one should be playing poli-
tics here. I look forward to supporting 
Finland and Sweden’s NATO applica-
tion when they are voted on here in 
this Chamber. 
The Russian military has suffered 
substantial losses in this war already. 
Exact estimates are impossible to 
come by, but it appears in just the first 
3 months of this war, Russia has lost as 
many soldiers as it did in the 9-year 
war that they waged in Afghanistan. 
Let’s remember that President Putin 
thought this would be an easy victory. 
He thought Ukraine’s defenses would 
be torn apart and shattered in a matter 
of days and the Ukrainians would lose 
all hope and all morale. And he 
thought his actions would split NATO, 
that the alliance would be unable to re-
spond. Clearly, the opposite has been 
the case. 
And within Russia, there has been 
dissent, as well. Last week, Boris 
Bondarev, Counselor at the Permanent 
Mission of the Russian Federation to 
United Nations in Geneva resigned his 
post. His letter to his colleagues is tell-
ing. This is from a senior Russian offi-
cial: 
For 20 years of my diplomatic career, I 
have seen turns of our foreign policy, but 
never have I been so ashamed of my country 
as on February 24 of this year— 
Referring to the date the invasion 
was launched. 
The aggressive war unleashed by Putin and 
the entire Western world is not only a crime 
against the Ukrainian people, but also, per-
haps, the most serious crime against the peo-
ple of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing 
out all hopes and prospects for a prosperous 
free society in our country. 
He is right. There have also been re-
ports of many rank-and-file Russian 
soldiers who oppose this war and refuse 
to fight. And there is a recent report of 
a Russian officer who became so dis-
illusioned with the lies he had been 
told, he resigned in protest. His own 
words are telling: 
We had a radio receiver, and we could lis-
ten to the news. 
He said this to CNN, by the way. 
That’s how I learned that shops are closing 
in Russia and the economy is collapsing. I 
felt guilty about this. But felt even more 
guilty because we came to Ukraine. 
And he should. This resignation is 
telling as Russians from every part of 
society are beginning to see this war 
for what it is—unprovoked, tragic, 
shameful acts of aggression that have 
brought international condemnation 
and shame to Russia as a nation. I am 
confident this is the first of many acts 
of conscience by senior and junior Rus-
sian officials as they seek to restore 
some level of honor and dignity to 
their Nation. Kremlin officials and 
commandos on the ground should know 
that the world is watching and the war 
crimes are being recorded. It is not too 
late to say no to orders to attack and 
kill 
your 
innocent 
neighbors 
in 
Ukraine. 
Now, as I have mentioned over the 
last several weeks as we talked about 
that, there are a number of very impor-
tant sanctions that are in place. We 
talked about trading sanctions; elimi-
nating Russia’s tax status; banking 
sanctions to crush the economy in Rus-
sia; the desperate need right now for us 
to focus more on energy and boy-
cotting energy supplies because that is 
the single most important sanction 
that has not been put in place in the 
way it needs to be. It is funding the 
Putin war machine. Europe is making 
progress on this. In fact, by August, we 
are told, they will no longer be buying 
Russian coal, for example. But Russia 
is still getting from Europe $870 mil-
lion a day in energy receipts, and that 
is funding the Putin war machine. 
Especially when Russia not only con-
tinues its onslaught on Ukrainian de-
fensive combatants but on noncombat-
ants, these sanctions must be tight-
ened. And what they are doing is com-
mitting war crimes. I call on the Inter-
national Criminal Court, which has an-
nounced an investigation already, to 
follow in Ukraine’s footsteps and im-
mediately begin a war crimes tribunal 
now—don’t wait—because it can have a 
deterrent effect if it is done now. 
We continue to hear the stories every 
day, and the stories get worse and 
worse. I was glad to hear that a court 
in Kyiv began hearings against Ser-
geant Vadim Shishimarin, the first 
Russian soldier to go on trial for al-
leged war crimes. He is accused of 
shooting and killing a 62-year-old civil-
ian man in the northeastern Ukrainian 
region of Sumy in late February just a 
few yards from his home. He pled 
guilty, and just yesterday—yesterday— 
he was sentenced to life in prison. 
Again, Russian officials and com-
manders need to see this. These war 
crimes are being committed, they are 
being prosecuted, and there will be con-
sequences. 
Sadly, this one case we talked about 
is just a drop in the bucket. Ukraine’s 
Prosecutor General has said that her 
office is currently investigating more 
than 10,000 alleged war crimes by Rus-
sian forces involving more than 600 sus-
pects. It will take a vast amount of 
time and resources to hold these crimi-
nals to account, and the United States 
should help Ukraine in this regard. The 
supplemental 
spending 
package 
we 
talked about includes money to do just 
that—to investigate and document war 
crimes and crimes against humanity 
committed 
by 
Russian 
forces 
in 
Ukraine. 
My hope is that holding these Rus-
sians accountable will have that deter-
rent effect. 
Because of these terrible actions, I 
believe Russia also deserves to be des-
ignated as a state sponsor of terrorism. 
I believe the Senate should vote on 
that. In Chechnya, in Syria, and now in 
Ukraine, Russia has committed atroc-
ities that reflect a complete disregard 
for the value of human life. It has ter-
rorized its neighbors and committed 
clear war crimes and crimes against 
humanity in Ukraine. 
Let me be clear. What the Russian 
military is doing in Ukraine is not just 
the product of individual undisciplined 
units; tacit approval for acts like these 
come from the top of the command 
chain. 
I have mentioned America’s leader-
ship 
stateside 
and 
what 
everyday 
Americans have done in light of this 
Russian aggression and their support 
for Ukraine. It is truly impressive. It is 
happening in my State of Ohio and 
around the country, the contributions 
in so many ways: the medical supplies 
that have been sent, the personal van-
ity kits that have been sent, the 
amount of food that has been volun-
tarily given through the World Central 
Kitchen and others. But tonight I want 
to close with a few thoughts on our 
leadership abroad as President Biden is 
wrapping up his first trip to Asia. 
First, I commend the President for 
taking this trip and for working with

our allies. As China continues to ad-
vance its interest not only throughout 
the Indo-Pacific but around the globe, 
it is so important that the United 
States help lead freedom-loving coun-
tries in countering their malign ac-
tions too. 
I visited the region last month with 
some 
of 
my 
colleagues, 
and 
my 
takeaway was that our partners in the 
region have a newfound interest in 
working with us, allying with us, par-
ticularly with what is going on with re-
gard to China’s aggressive behavior in 
the Indo-Pacific region. 
I also think one of the best ways to 
push back against what China is doing 
and considering doing, particularly 
with regard to Taiwan, is for us to win 
in Ukraine. Russia being defeated in 
Ukraine will affect what happens in the 
Indo-Pacific region. 
China right now is entirely aligned 
with Russia. Their joint statement ear-
lier this year says, as the invasion was 
being planned, ‘‘Friendship between 
[our] two States has no limits, there 
are no ‘forbidden’ areas of coopera-
tion.’’ 
We are now seeing China’s attempt to 
extend their reach with a base in the 
Solomon Islands, as an example. We 
heard about this when we were over 
there. They have negotiated in secret a 
security agreement to allow Beijing to 
send military personnel to this new Pa-
cific ally of theirs and base naval ves-
sels potentially on the islands. This 
would be terrible for the region, par-
ticularly for Australia—their eastern 
border is only about 1,200 miles away 
from the Solomon Islands. 
In Ukraine, we have shown strong 
leadership. We must not stop now when 
it comes to our allies across the globe. 
It doesn’t matter if it is Russia or 
China—we must be the beacon of 
strength for the free world and help 
bring people together. To do so, we 
must also start thinking about what it 
will take to aid Ukraine in the long 
term. I am not talking about nation 
building here, but I am talking about 
helping them in terms of this pro-
tracted conflict with Russia and ensur-
ing that we do rebuild a democratic 
and free Ukraine. Thinking ahead in 
this fashion may seem premature to 
some, but I do believe it can save re-
sources in the long run by thinking 
about how to plan for that now. 
In short, we should plan for the possi-
bility of a longer conflict than we had 
originally anticipated. 
Again, our role in Ukraine is essen-
tial, but it is a role that combines us 
with so many other partners around 
the world. Again, over 40 countries are 
helping right now in terms of assist-
ance to Ukraine. We are not the 
world’s policeman, but we are kind of 
like the world’s sheriff, and bringing in 
that posse of other freedom-loving 
countries is so critical for us to do, 
whether it is in the Indo-Pacific region 
or whether it is in regard to Ukraine. 
We have had tremendous success in 
terms of bringing people together to 
stand for freedom, to stand for democ-
racy, and to stand for the rights of the 
Ukrainian people. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Connecticut. 
ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, 13 kids 
dead in an elementary school in Texas 
right now. What are we doing? What 
are we doing? 
Just days after a shooter walked into 
a grocery store to gun down African- 
American patrons, we have another 
Sandy Hook on our hands. What are we 
doing? 
There have been more mass shootings 
than days in the year. Our kids are liv-
ing in fear every single time they set 
foot in a classroom because they think 
they are going to be next. What are we 
doing? 
Why do you spend all this time run-
ning for the U.S. Senate? Why do you 
go through all the hassle of getting 
this job, of putting yourself in a posi-
tion of authority, if your answer is 
that, as the slaughter increases, as our 
kids run for their lives, we do nothing? 
What are we doing? Why are you here if 
not to solve a problem as existential as 
this? 
This isn’t inevitable. These kids 
weren’t unlucky. This only happens in 
this country and nowhere else. No-
where else do little kids go to school 
thinking that they might be shot that 
day. Nowhere else do parents have to 
talk to their kids, as I have had to do, 
about why they got locked in a bath-
room and told to be quiet for 5 minutes 
just in case a bad man entered that 
building. Nowhere else does that hap-
pen except here in the United States of 
America, and it is a choice. It is our 
choice to let it continue. What are we 
doing? 
In Sandy Hook Elementary School 
after those kids came back into those 
classrooms, they had to adopt a prac-
tice in which there would be a safe 
word that the kids would say if they 
started to get thoughts in their brain 
about what they saw that day, if they 
started to get nightmares during the 
day, reliving stepping over their class-
mates’ bodies as they tried to flee the 
school. 
In one classroom, that word was 
‘‘monkey.’’ Over and over and over 
through the day, kids would stand up 
and yell ‘‘monkey,’’ and a teacher or a 
paraprofessional would have to go over 
to that kid, take them out of the class-
room, talk to them about what they 
had seen, work them through their 
issues. 
Sandy Hook will never ever be the 
same. This community in Texas will 
never ever be the same. 
Why? Why are we here if not to try to 
make sure that fewer schools and fewer 
communities go through what Sandy 
Hook has gone through, what Uvalde is 
going through? Our hearts are breaking 
for these families. Every ounce of love 
and thoughts and prayers we can send, 
we are sending. But I am here on this 
floor to beg, to literally get down on 
my hands and knees and beg my col-
leagues: Find a path forward here. 
Work with us to find a way to pass laws 
that make this less likely. 
I understand my Republican col-
leagues will not agree to everything 
that I may support, but there is a com-
mon denominator that we can find. 
There is a place where we can achieve 
agreement. This may not guarantee 
that America never ever again sees a 
mass shooting. It may not overnight 
cut in half the number of murders that 
happen in America. It will not solve 
the problem of American violence by 
itself. But by doing something, we at 
least stop sending this quiet message of 
endorsement to these killers whose 
brains are breaking, who see the high-
est levels of government doing nothing 
shooting after shooting. 
What are we doing? Why are we here? 
What are we doing? 
I yield the floor.

ator from Montana. 
TRIBUTE TO MIKE DEVRIES 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, today I 
have the distinct honor of recognizing 
Mike DeVries of Fergus County as 
Montanan of the Month for his dedica-
tion to serving his community and his 
courage during the Denton fire this 
past December. 
Mike joined the volunteer fire de-
partment shortly after moving to Den-
ton with his family back in 2004 and 
has been loyal to the department and 
community ever since, serving as chief 
for 11 years. 
On December 1, 2021, Mike’s love of 
his community and resolute leadership 
was on full display. As the West Wind 
fire tore through the town of Denton, 
Mike acted swiftly to maintain inci-
dent command and ensure the safety of 
his firefighters and members of the 
Denton community. 
As Montana suffered a terrible fire 
season in 2021, Mike not only coordi-
nated aid and resources, he showed 
care and compassion to his fellow resi-
dents of Denton and the surrounding 
area. 
He met with folks who were impacted 
by the fires and connected personally 
with all the local firefighters and com-
munity members who showed up to 
help. 
Serving as the Denton fire chief is 
just one of the ways Mike gives back to 
his community. He is also on the elder 
board of the Denton Bible Church and 
has served several terms on the town 
council. 
As a volunteer fire chief, he has spent 
countless hours training, traveling, 
and managing the department. 
His son Joel says that Mike is held in 
high regard by other firefighters as he 
works to build relationships between 
Denton and surrounding departments. 
While Mike is quick to give credit to 
his crew, he deserves recognition for 
his leadership during the 2021 fire sea-
son, loyalty to the Denton Fire Depart-
ment, and compassion for his commu-
nity.

Mike, keep up the great work. You do 
make Montana proud. 
TRIBUTE TO KAREN PFAEHLER 
Mr. President, today, I have the 
honor of recognizing a staff member 
who has turned into family over the 
years. 
Karen Pfaehler is truly one of a kind. 
She has set the standard for con-
stituent recognitions in Montana, and 
now it is my turn to recognize her as 
she retires after many years of service 
to Montana. 
Karen got her bachelor’s degree in el-
ementary education and psychology 
and was hired to work as a military 
aerospace program manager and con-
tract analyst in Denver, CO. 
As fate would have it, she met the 
love of her life, Gus Pfaehler, at a sales 
convention. 
They moved to Hong Kong for his 
work and lived there for many years. 
Later, while living in Bangkok, Karen 
volunteered and ran the charity divi-
sion of the American Women’s Club. 
The organization’s philanthropic arm 
gave donations, mostly to Peace Corps 
volunteers and orphanages. 
Karen also enjoyed entertaining Am-
bassadors and dignitaries for various 
functions and events. 
It was in Hong Kong that Karen and 
her husband raised their daughter 
Jaclyn, the pride of their lives. 
After their time in Bangkok came to 
a close, they moved stateside to Salt 
Lake City, UT. 
Once Gus retired from his corporate 
role, they decided to call Bozeman, MT, 
home, and it was here that Karen was 
able to pursue her passion of events 
and events planning and politics. Her 
skills were highly sought after, and 
soon she became a mainstay in Mon-
tana political events. In fact, in 2015, 
she signed on with my team and, lucky 
for us, she decided to stay. 
Karen and her sidekick Winnie, her 
dog, have spent countless hours comb-
ing through every detail of Montana 
news and headlines, catching every 
outstanding Montanan. 
Karen has worked tirelessly, making 
sure all Montanans are honored for 
their 
heroism, 
their 
anniversaries, 
their birthdays, and, of course, she 
planned all of our events. 
One story in particular that comes to 
mind was when she received word a 
large gathering was coming to one of 
our instate offices. Karen wasted no 
time getting the details ironed out and 
created a welcoming experience for our 
visitors and even had breakfast treats 
for everybody. It was a wonderful gath-
ering thanks to her hard work and her 
dedication. 
Karen, your expertise and attention 
to every detail will be missed. The cha-
risma, the positive attitude you bring 
to everything you do, is highly re-
garded by all of your peers and by me. 
Thank you for your years of service 
to the great State of Montana. We wish 
you well on your next chapter of being 
a full-time grandma. God bless you. 
NOMINATION OF DARA LINDENBAUM 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
rise 
today 
in 
support 
of 
Dara 
Lindenbaum’s nomination to be a Com-
missioner on the Federal Election 
Commission—FEC—the 
independent 
agency responsible for enforcing Fed-
eral campaign finance laws. 
Ms. Lindenbaum is an experienced 
nominee who is respected on both sides 
of the aisle; that is why earlier this 
month her nomination was reported 
out of the Rules Committee with bipar-
tisan support, including from Ranking 
Member BLUNT. I hope more of my Re-
publican colleagues will join us in sup-
porting her nomination today. 
I would also like to note that the last 
time the Senate considered the nomi-
nation of FEC Commissioners in De-
cember 2020, we confirmed two Repub-
licans and one Democrat, who—impor-
tantly—restored a quorum to the Com-
mission. 
Ms. Lindenbaum’s confirmation will 
simply maintain the Commission’s cur-
rent partisan balance, since she has 
been nominated to fill the seat being 
vacated 
by 
Commissioner 
Walther 
after many years of service. 
The FEC is charged with a critical 
role in ensuring accountability in our 
system of government, and it was es-
tablished by Congress in the wake of 
the Watergate scandal to restore the 
public’s faith in our electoral proc-
esses, to make it clear that, in Amer-
ica, politicians must play by the rules, 
so that the votes of the people decide 
our elections. 
Now, 47 years later, the work of the 
FEC is as important as ever. The 2020 
election cycle was the most expensive 
in history. Total spending was over $14 
billion with $8 billion spent on political 
advertisements alone. And too many 
voters feel like their voices are being 
drowned out. At the same time, the 
Commission is facing the challenges 
that arise given rapidly evolving tech-
nologies and the ongoing threat of for-
eign interference in our elections. 
It is a big and important job, but 
Dara Lindenbaum is more than capable 
of taking it on. Ms. Lindenbaum has 
extensive experience in election and 
campaign finance law, with years of ex-
perience working for a civil rights non-
profit and in private practice. She also 
has firsthand experience at the FEC 
where she worked as a law clerk early 
in her legal career, and her work rep-
resenting clients before the FEC will 
allow her to bring an important per-
spective to the Commission. 
Throughout the confirmation proc-
ess, Ms. Lindenbaum has shown that 
she will be a fair and effective Commis-
sioner. In her testimony, she stated 
that ‘‘[t]he consideration of the facts 
and the law in front of me will be my 
guideposts as I seek to provide clarity 
to the regulated community, increase 
transparency, and collaborate with my 
fellow Commissioners[.]’’ 
She is both well qualified and well re-
spected. Before Ms. Lindenbaum’s nom-
ination hearing, the Rules Committee 
received a letter from 30 of the Na-
tion’s top campaign finance lawyers. 
The 
letter 
‘‘enthusiastically’’ 
rec-
ommends Ms. Lindenbaum’s confirma-
tion, and it is signed by Republicans, 
Democrats, and Independents, includ-
ing Lee Goodman, a former Republican 
Chairman 
of 
the 
FEC, 
and 
Karl 
Sandstrom, a former Democratic Com-
missioner. In the letter—and these are 
their words, not mine—these attorneys 
praise her as a ‘‘thoughtful and con-
scientious advocate’’ and ‘‘a genial and 
inclusive colleague.’’ I agree with their 
conclusion that she would be ‘‘an excel-
lent addition to the Commission.’’ 
The fact that Ms. Lindenbaum has 
support from top campaign finance at-
torneys in both parties is no surprise, 
since she learned about getting along 
across the aisle at a young age—from 
her own family. Growing up, her par-
ents supported different political par-
ties, and so every election day, she 
would take two trips to their polling 
place, one to watch her mom vote and 
then another with her dad. Her parents’ 
example will serve her well on the 
Commission, which in recent years has 
often suffered from partisan divides 
and stalemate. 
As we know, no more than three 
Commissioners can be from the same 
political party, but it requires four 
votes to take most actions. So when 
votes consistently fall along party 
lines, very little gets done. For exam-
ple, the FEC has not enacted any major 
disclosure rules or internet regulations 
in over a decade. Hundreds of enforce-
ment cases have been left unresolved. 
This is not fair to candidates or to the 
public. 
While I continue to urge my col-
leagues to pass legislation to address 
some of these issues, it is also up to the 
Commissioners to figure out ways to 
work across party lines and find bipar-
tisan agreement. I know that Ms. 
Lindenbaum is up to the task and that 
she will work to find common ground 
with her fellow Commissioners on 
these difficult issues. 
Our Nation was founded on the ideals 
of democracy, and we have seen for 
ourselves in this building how we can’t 
afford to take that for granted. We are 
reminded every day, as we see the peo-
ple of Ukraine putting their lives on 
the line to stand up for their democ-
racy, that it is up to all of us to protect 
our system of government here at 
home. At its core, that is the job of the 
FEC, to ensure the agency fulfills its 
mission to ‘‘protect the integrity of the 
Federal 
campaign 
finance 
process’’ 
and, in doing so, to keep our democ-
racy strong. 
I 
am 
confident 
that 
Dara 
Lindenbaum is up to this challenge, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
for cloture and support her confirma-
tion.

TRIBUTE TO NOAH THOMPSON 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President,

Country 
Music 
Highway 
cuts 
through seven counties in eastern Ken-
tucky that have produced some of the 
finest singers in American history, 
from Loretta Lynn, to Chris Stapleton, 
to Ricky Skaggs. Now, this formidable 
list of world-famous Kentucky country 
artists 
has 
a 
new 
member: 
Noah 
Thompson. Today, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in honoring Noah for becom-
ing the first Kentuckian to win ‘‘Amer-
ican Idol.’’ 
A few months ago, few people—even 
in Noah’s hometown of Louisa—had 
ever heard America’s best new vocalist 
perform. Noah was working as a con-
struction worker at Addiction Recov-
ery Care, had never sung publicly, and 
hadn’t even been musically trained. 
When Noah’s best friend Arthur signed

him up for ‘‘American Idol,’’ the singer 
worried about making it past audi-
tions, never imagining he would earn 
the ‘‘golden ticket’’ to Hollywood, let 
alone become a finalist. 
But Arthur believed Noah had a spe-
cial talent, and, after several arduous 
rounds, he emerged victorious after re-
ceiving the most votes out of 16 million 
cast by fans all across the country. In 
the process, he brought the ‘‘American 
Idol’’ camera crew back to Louisa to 
film a hometown video with commu-
nity leaders, his family, and thousands 
of fans. He shined a light on eastern 
Kentucky, sharing the special culture 
and history that makes the region such 
a hotbed for musical talent. 
Throughout the contest, Noah radi-
ated humility and warmth. Labeled the 
‘‘king of ‘aw shucks’ ’’ by one of the 
judges, he entered every round of com-
petition with the best of Kentucky’s 
attitude and spirit. Even when Noah 
caught COVID–19 and had to isolate in 
his hotel room, he performed cheer-
fully and continued to win viewers’ 
hearts. 
I am proud of Noah for winning this 
contest and jumping headfirst into 
what I can only imagine will be a suc-
cessful musical career. And I am proud 
of Louisa, KY, for producing such a 
fine young gentleman to represent the 
Commonwealth on the national stage. 
On behalf of the Senate, I share our 
congratulations with Noah and wish 
him the best as he pursues his dreams 
as a recording artist.

TRIBUTE TO CYNDY NOVOTNY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to celebrate the retirement 
of Cyndy Novotny, principal of St. An-
thony’s Tri-Parish Catholic School in 
Casper, WY. 
This summer, Cyndy Novotny marks 
her 17th and final year as principal at 
St. Anthony’s School. The present St. 
Anthony’s School building stands as a 
testament to her 45-year career in edu-
cation. St. Anthony’s Catholic School 
was dedicated on September 27, 1927, in 
the belief that education is one of the 
most important ways that the Catholic 
Church fulfills its commitment to God. 
St. Anthony’s School is dedicated to 
achieving academic excellence in a 
faith-filled 
community. 
Guided 
by 
strong religious and educational lead-
ership, Casper students from preschool 
through eighth grade can learn to live 
enriched lives committed to Christian 
service. 
Cyndy was instrumental in the de-
sign and fundraising for this classic, 
state-of-the-art building. The school is 
able to meet students’ educational 
needs while keeping them connected to 
their faith. Her skills in fundraising 
also supported student tuition, making 
Christian 
education 
accessible 
for 
many families. 
Cyndy grew up in the Chicago area, 
receiving her bachelor of science in ele-
mentary education from Illinois State 
University in 1977. After moving to 
Casper, she taught at several schools, 
including first grade at Southridge Ele-
mentary for 7 years and second grade 
at Sagewood Elementary for another 7 
years. While continuing to teach, she 
earned her master’s degree in teaching 
from Grand Canyon University in 2001. 
Cyndy was a leading light in the de-
velopment of the groundbreaking inno-
vative Woods Learning Center in Cas-
per. Cyndy taught at Woods for 14 
years before accepting the principal po-
sition at St. Anthony’s Tri-Parish 
Catholic School. 
Cyndy is an accomplished academi-
cian, educator, and public servant. She 
worked to enhance educational cur-
riculum and administration as a speak-
er at the National School Board An-
nual 
Convention 
and 
International 
Reading 
Association 
Annual 
Con-
ference. Cyndy is also a dedicated wife, 
mother, and grandmother. While teach-
ing, 
she 
met 
her 
husband, 
Scott 
Novotny, a now-retired teacher from 
Natrona 
County 
High 
School. 
To-
gether, they have three children, Mick 
Novotny with wife Dr. Ruma Novotny, 
Caitlin Dixon with husband Brian 
Dixon, and Connor Novotny. Cyndy and 
Scott also have five grandchildren: 
Ashwin, Colter, Aubrey, Austin, and 
Jackson. 
Cyndy’s community involvement is 
extensive, having been awarded the 
Natrona County School District Sig-
nificant Educator three times and the 
Ellbogen Meritorious Education Award 
She was nominated for Disney Teacher 
of the Year and was twice nominated 
for the Presidential Awards for Excel-
lence in Mathematics and Science 
Teaching. 
Children across Wyoming and the Na-
tion benefited from her involvement 
with the National Education Associa-
tion, National Center of Innovation 
Conference, Wyoming Reading Associa-
tion, and Casper Reading Association. 
Cyndy’s accomplishments and con-
tributions will continue to enrich the 
education of future generations of stu-
dents. The community thanks Cyndy 
for her public service. We recognize her 
invaluable contribution to the St. An-
thony’s Tri-Parish Catholic School, 
Natrona County School District No. 1, 
and the development of educational 
curriculum across Wyoming. Cyndy is 
a pillar of the Casper community. 
Cyndy’s dedication to her faith is evi-
dent through her service as a eucha-
ristic minister, Music Minister, and a 
member of the Parish Council at St. 
Patrick’s Catholic Church. She exem-
plifies Christian values and the Code of 
the West, living each day with courage 
and taking pride in her work. Cyndy’s 
joy in her work touched the lives of 
hundreds of children, including my 
own. 
It is with great pleasure that I recog-
nize this outstanding member of our 
Wyoming community. My wife Bobbi 
joins me in extending our best wishes 
to Cyndy Novotny upon her retire-
ment. 
150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WYO-
MING STOCK GROWERS ASSOCIA-
TION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the 150th anniver-
sary of the Wyoming Stock Growers 
Association. This organization is of in-
credible historical and influential im-
portance for the State of Wyoming and 
agriculture everywhere. 
From Wednesday, June 8, to Satur-
day, June 11, 2022, the Wyoming Stock 
Growers Association will host their an-
nual Wyoming Cattle Industry Conven-
tion. They will celebrate their 150th 
anniversary with a rodeo, banquet, and 
parade. They will meet in Cheyenne, 
WY, where they can trace their begin-
nings back to 1872. There, a group of 
five cattlemen met in a livery stable to 
organize a group to tackle the growing 
threat of stock rustlers. Their organi-
zation, then known as the Stock Asso-
ciation of Laramie County, was only 
the second State cattlemen association 
in the United States. Wyoming, how-
ever, was not yet a State. 
Over the years, members included 
mayors, State legislators, Governors, 
and congressmen. U.S. Senators Robert 
D. Carey, John B. Kendrick, and Cliff 
Hansen all served as presidents of the 
Wyoming Stock Growers Association. 
My colleague Senator CYNTHIA LUMMIS 
is an honorary life member. 
Every Wyoming student knows of the 
infamous 1889–1893 Johnson County 
War involving the Wyoming Stock 
Growers Association. It required inter-
vention by U.S. cavalry troops sent by 
President Benjamin Harrison. The con-
flict has been recounted by numerous 
personalities ranging from rodeo cham-
pion 
and 
singer/songwriter 
Chris 
LeDoux 
to 
the 
fictional 
Rooster 
Cogburn. 
Today, you will find members pro-
moting the beef industry through their 
Young Producers Assembly, Environ-
mental Stewardship Program, Centen-
nial Farm and Ranch Program, and the 
Endowment Trust. 
Local input is essential to the serv-
ices provided by the Wyoming Stock 
Growers. On any given week, you will 
find a county cattlemen group meeting 
together to bring their issues and pri-
orities to the State association. The 
Stock Growers’ auxiliary, the Cow- 
Belles, are integral members of their 
communities and are fantastic pro-
moters of Wyoming’s beef industry. 
Regional education events bring val-
uable 
expertise 
to 
the 
raising 
of 
healthy cattle on healthy lands. Infor-
mation 
is 
made 
widely 
available 
through their various publications. The 
association’s staff does an incredible 
job 
of 
serving 
their 
membership 
through educating and promoting their 
trade to the public. 
The Wyoming Stock Growers of 2022 
have a remarkable leadership team. 
Executive director Jim Magagna has 
lead the association since 1998 and is 
Wyoming beef’s greatest advocate. He 
is joined by Olivia Sanchez and Susan 
Skinner in their office in Cheyenne.

The board of directors includes presi-
dent David Kane, first vice president 
Jack Berger, regional vice presidents 
Kahla Mills, Dan Frank, Leif Hanson, 
Brad Mead, Darla Griffin, and Young 
Producers Assembly president Sage 
Askin. 
These 
steadfast 
individuals 
wear many hats in their communities 
and around Wyoming. Their dedication 
will ensure a robust cattle industry in 
the state and a strong organization to 
support them well into the future. 
The mission of the Wyoming Stock 
Growers is an important one to the 
character of the State. They advocate 
for the cattle industry and rural life. 
They develop policies to conserve and 
best manage the vast Wyoming land-
scape. They work with regulators at 
every facet of government. The Great 
Seal on every Wyoming flag and our 
State seal displays a rancher. This is 
the heritage of the stewards of the land 
who provide the Nation with quality 
products and food on their tables. 
Cattlemen and their families created 
towns and built economies around the 
industry starting when Wyoming was 
still a territory. The tenacity and prin-
ciples of these hard-working people are 
embodied through our Code of the 
West, the University of Wyoming’s 
‘‘Cowboys,’’ and the work of the Wyo-
ming Stock Growers. The theme of the 
Stock Growers centennial celebration 
in 1972 was ‘‘Guardian of the Grass-
lands.’’ They continue to serve and 
conserve their industry and values in 
an ever-changing environment. 
It is a great privilege to recognize 
this incredible organization and their 
dedication to the Wyoming’s cattle and 
agriculture industry. Bobbi joins me in 
extending our congratulations and deep 
gratitude to the Wyoming Stock Grow-
ers Association on their 150th anniver-
sary celebration.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO HERSHEL ‘‘WOODY’’ 
WILLIAMS 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the honor of recognizing a 
true American hero, Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ 
Williams. Woody is a veteran of the 
U.S. Marine Corps and recipient of the 
Congressional Medal of Honor for his 
immense bravery during the Battle of 
Iwo Jima in World War II. Woody is 
also a former representative of the Vet-
erans Administration and founder of 
the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ Williams Medal 
of Honor Foundation. 
Woody always had a desire to serve 
his country, and to this day, he con-
tinues that effort. His initial attempt 
to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps, at 
just 17 years old, was derailed by his 
disapproving mother. The following 
year, he was again denied entry be-
cause he did not meet the height re-
quirement. However, at the age of 19 
and after the height requirement had 
been reduced, Woody finally was able 
to join the Marine Corps and begin a 
journey that would not only bring 
honor to his family and friends, but to 
our entire Nation. 
After training as a flame thrower op-
erator, Woody was deployed to the Pa-
cific where he fought in the Guadal-
canal Campaign and in Guam. On Feb-
ruary 21, 1945, he landed at Iwo Jima. 
With the support of just four marine 
gunners, Woody gallantly eliminated 
pillbox after pillbox, successfully re-
ducing heavy machinegun fire to make 
way for our advancing troops. Even 
though the situation was beyond des-
perate, he continued on, knowing what 
needed to be done to win and to save 
the lives of his brothers. When the bat-
tle concluded, he had eliminated six 
enemy pillboxes. 
That same day, U.S. forces heroically 
hoisted the American flag on top of 
Mount Suribachi. Woody’s bravery was 
instrumental to the military success at 
Iwo Jima, and his bravery was ac-
knowledged at the White House by 
President Harry Truman on October 5, 
1945, with the Medal of Honor. In addi-
tion to those honors, an Armed Forces 
Center in Woody’s hometown of Fair-
mont, WV, holds his name. The Hershel 
‘‘Woody’’ Williams Armed Forces Re-
serves Center is the only National 
Guard facility in the country to bear 
the name of a living marine. Also hon-
oring Woody is a Veterans of Foreign 
Wars post in Fairmont, WV, a bridge in 
Barboursville, WV, and an Expedi-
tionary Sea Base Vessel. 
Woody continued to serve his coun-
try well after the war, working for the 
Veterans Administration as a veteran 
service representative for 33 years out 
of offices in West Virginia and New 
Mexico, where he continued to serve 
his military family. After Woody re-
tired in 1979, he continued to support 
veterans through the Hershel ‘‘Woody’’ 
Williams Medal of Honor Foundation. 
This foundation preserves the memory 
of the brave men lost at war, remind-
ing us all of the price that must be paid 
for freedom. His effort to build Gold 
Star Family Memorials in all 50 States 
is also coming to a successful close, 
with the 50th memorial being unveiled 
in Bozeman, MT, on Memorial Day, 
2022. 
It is because of heroes like Woody, 
that America is known as the land of 
the free and the home of brave. I want 
to thank you, Mr. WILLIAMS, for your 
continued service to our great country 
and for displaying such tremendous 
courage, not only during times of war, 
but throughout your life.∑

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
TRICENTEN-
NIAL OF THE TOWN OF HAMP-
TON FALLS, NEW HAMPSHIRE 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to join Granite Staters in 
celebrating the 300th anniversary, as 
well as the rich history and vibrant 
present, of the Town of Hampton Falls, 
NH. 
Originally a parish of the Town of 
Hampton, Hampton Falls later was es-
tablished as an independent town, gain-
ing its name from the falls located on 
the surrounding river. The town’s his-
tory is reflected in its rural roots; 
many of its early residents worked in 
the timber industry or on farms in the 
region, and it is home to one of the old-
est working apple orchards in the coun-
try. And over the last 300 years, Hamp-
ton Falls has been home to prominent 
New Hampshire citizens, including the 
first Governor of New Hampshire and 
poet John Greenleaf Whittier. 
The residents of Hampton Falls are 
also dedicated to preserving this his-
tory; the Hampton Falls Historical So-
ciety’s motto is ‘‘Our future is a 
present from the past.’’ Learning from 
our past and remembering our history 
is essential to a healthy democracy, 
and I applaud the Hampton Falls com-
munity for its commitment to its his-
tory. 
Today with its 2,400 residents, Hamp-
ton Falls remains a small-town resi-
dential and agricultural community. 
From its small business community to 
the orchards and horse farms that re-
flect 
its 
agricultural 
beginnings, 
Hampton Falls is a vital part of New 
Hampshire’s Seacoast. 
While Hampton Falls has changed 
over the years, what has remained is 
the strong sense of community that 
makes New Hampshire a great place to 
live, work, visit, and raise a family. 
I want to thank everyone involved in 
the 
tricentennial 
celebrations 
hap-
pening throughout Hampton Falls this 
year to help mark this milestone. I 
hope that the residents and visitors 
alike are able to enjoy the year’s 
events and reflect upon Hampton Falls’ 
abundant history and vibrant culture.∑

RECOGNIZING DRUTHER’S 
RESTAURANT 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, each week I recognize an 
outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize the small busi-
ness, Druther’s Restaurant of Camp-
bellsville, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Steve McCarty, owner and operator 
of the last remaining Druther’s res-
taurant in the world, understands the 
importance of commitment and pas-
sion when managing a business. His 
dad built the Campbellsville store in 
1970, originally named Burger Queen 
before the company’s rebrand to Druth-
er’s in 1980. It was an independent fran-
chise fully owned by the McCarty fam-
ily. Steve developed a love for the 
Druther’s business at a young age, as 
he began working there at only 15 
years old. At its peak of success, the 
Druther’s franchise had around 200 lo-
cations spanning from Florida to Mis-
souri, as well as international loca-
tions and a devoted consumer base. In 
light of financial woes burdening the

company in the early 1990s, the owners 
decided to sell their business to Dairy 
Queen, leaving 12 independent fran-
chises remaining. Despite this drastic 
change within the company, Steve and 
his family wanted to continue the 
Druther’s tradition and keep their 
independent restaurant open. Having 
now worked at Druther’s for over 45 
years, Steve McCarty is the embodi-
ment of dedication and persistence as 
he works day in and day out to pre-
serve the Druther’s story. 
To this day, Steve will have res-
taurant-goers come and visit Druther’s 
from all over the country, seeking a 
taste of the classic food they once cher-
ished. Druther’s has maintained the 
same menu ever since its installation 
in 1970, only adding additional items to 
create a wider selection for customers. 
Throughout its operation, Druther’s 
has always been and continues to be a 
shining example of what makes a great 
restaurant: tasty food, excellent serv-
ice, 
and 
an 
unspoken 
familiarity 
among staff and customers. Along with 
its excellent food and atmosphere, 
Druther’s is committed to giving back 
to the people of Campbellsville and the 
surrounding areas. Steve and his team 
have been a part of several charitable 
initiatives, including donating to the 
Toys for Tots program, sending food to 
Taylor County High School in Camp-
bellsville, and providing free hot meals 
to all Taylor County residents affected 
by tornadoes in December of 2021. 
Druther’s continues to provide a 
sense of joyful nostalgia that their 
loyal customers love. The restaurant’s 
devotion to keeping the magic of the 
brand alive is evident among their 
staff, as Steve works alongside several 
employees who have been there for 
over a decade—a testament to both 
Steve as a business owner and to the 
wonderful work environment he has 
cultivated since Druther’s founding. 
The old-fashioned and welcoming na-
ture of Druther’s makes it the perfect 
time-capsule for Kentuckians to re-live 
cherished memories of days gone by. 
Druther’s unwavering commitment to 
high quality and service is the reason 
why people from all over the country 
are willing to travel hundreds of miles 
to enjoy their delicious food. This res-
taurant demonstrates the important 
role small businesses play within a 
tightknit community, providing joy 
and support to their friends and neigh-
bors alike. Congratulations to Steve 
and the entire Druther’s team. I wish 
them the best of luck and look forward 
to watching their continued growth 
and success in Kentucky.∑

TRIBUTE TO KIRK MILLER 
∑ Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I 
would like to share a few words today 
to honor an outstanding Montana edu-
cator who is retiring at the end of this 
school year. 
Kirk Miller has dedicated his career 
to bettering the lives of the next gen-
eration of Montanans. Over the years, 
Kirk served as a teacher, a principal, 
and a superintendent before being ap-
pointed to the Montana Board of Pub-
lic Education where he later served as 
chair. 
As 
Bozeman 
schools 
super-
intendent, Kirk played a key role in 
improving infrastructure for students 
for years to come. He championed nu-
merous 
successful 
initiatives 
that 
strengthened public education in the 
region and served as a template for 
other communities to follow. 
At the end of this year, Kirk will be 
retiring from his most recent position 
as executive director of the School Ad-
ministrators of Montana, where he has 
worked tirelessly to support adminis-
trators and educators across the State. 
Those who have been lucky enough to 
work with Kirk recognize that he has a 
knack for connecting with people, even 
those who have different views than his 
own. And his passion for public edu-
cation shines through in everything he 
does. 
Under Kirk’s leadership, the School 
Administrators of Montana established 
the Leaders Professional Learning Pro-
gram, or SAM LPLP, a mentorship pro-
gram that brings administrators from 
across the State together to receive 
student-focused, solution-based profes-
sional development training. The SAM 
LPLP has served more than 500 admin-
istrators to date. 
As a former public school teacher I 
commend Kirk for his steadfast com-
mitment to improving our school sys-
tem from the top down. In addition to 
his work, Kirk has a lot to be proud 
of—in particular, the wonderful family 
he has built with his wife of 42 years, 
Nan. A lifelong educator and a dear 
friend 
to 
many, 
Kirk 
has 
shown 
through his kindness and work ethic 
that he is truly dedicated to bettering 
the lives of the next generation of Mon-
tanans. Thank you for your service, 
Kirk; our Montana schools are better 
because of you.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 647—DESIG-
NATING THE LAST WEEKEND OF 
JUNE 
2022 
TO 
COMMEMORATE 
THE FIRST WEEKEND OF THE 
1969 
HARLEM 
CULTURAL 
FES-
TIVAL 
AND 
THE 
FIRST 
FULL 
WEEKEND 
OF 
MAY 
TO 
COM-
MEMORATE THE FINAL WEEK-
END 
OF 
THE 
NEW 
ORLEANS 
JAZZ AND HERITAGE FESTIVAL 
OF 1970 
Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. 
CASSIDY) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 647 
Whereas, in the summer of 1969, singer 
Tony Lawrence, television and video director 
Hal Tulchin, New York Mayor John Lindsay, 
and New York City Parks Commissioner Au-
gust Heckscher organized the Harlem Cul-
tural Festival, where some of the most fa-
mous artists of color of the 1960s performed 
for free in Mount Morris Park (now Marcus 
Garvey Park) in Harlem, New York; 
Whereas the Harlem Cultural Festival was 
the culmination of a movement, in which 
Black artists, performers, and activists 
shared their art with hundreds of thousands 
of fellow Americans, entertained the throngs 
who attended, and gave voice to the political 
grievances of the late 1960s; 
Whereas, during the weekends of June 29, 
July 13, July 20, July 27, August 17, and Au-
gust 24 in 1969, performers and activists like 
Nina Simone, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King, 
Luther Vandross, Roebuck ‘‘Pops’’ Staples, 
Edwin Hawkins, Herbie Mann, Abbey Lin-
coln, Max Roach, Babatunde Olatunji, Ray 
Baretto and His Orchestra, Sonny Sharrock, 
Cal 
Tjader, 
Mongo 
Santamaria, 
George 
Kirby, Don Alias, Weldon Irvine, Larry Wil-
lis, Maurice King and the Soul Music Fes-
tival Band, Professor Herman Stevens and 
the Voices of Faith, Henry Franklin, Steve 
Berrios, Sonny Fortune, Rodgers Grant, Had-
ley Caliman, William Allen, Chuck Carter, 
Jackie ‘‘Moms’’ Mabley, Dewey ‘‘Pigmeat’’ 
Markham, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., and 
Marcus Garvey Jr. celebrated Black music 
and culture in the United States and uplifted 
the voices of civil rights and local New York 
and Louisiana activists; 
Whereas the Harlem Cultural Festival 
served as a stage to express both anger and 
hope for change, in the face of racial ten-
sions that had bubbled over during the 
months and years prior to the event, and in-
cluded notable moments such as— 
(1) Tony Lawrence inviting protestors, an-
gered by the building of a government office 
in Harlem when the neighborhood sorely 
needed a new high school, onto the main 
stage to highlight their cause; 
(2) speakers like Adam Clayton Powell Jr. 
and Marcus Garvey Jr. calling for racial jus-
tice and progress; 
(3) Nina Simone performing her song ‘‘To 
Be Young, Gifted and Black’’ and calling for 
equity; and 
(4) Mahalia Jackson singing ‘‘Take My 
Hand, Precious Lord’’, the song Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King’s family asked her to 
sing at his funeral; 
Whereas Mahalia Jackson’s performance 
became a defining moment for the festival, 
with attendees laughing, dancing, and crying 
along, mourning and celebrating the legacy 
of Dr. King as they acknowledged the end of 
an era and the beginning of a new phase in 
the Civil Rights Movement; 
Whereas the Harlem Cultural Festival rep-
resented a shift in Black culture, conscious-
ness, and expression, and the performances 
of the artists represented a movement away 
from performances designed to be palatable 
for white audiences and toward freer expres-
sion and celebration of Black art; 
Whereas 1969 was a turning point, defined 
by— 
(1) a new generation of Black activists and 
artists who wanted more than survival and 
respect and wanted to flourish; 
(2) Harlem, which had long been considered 
the center of Black culture, seeing a new cul-
tural explosion; and 
(3) the Black Power movement inspiring 
new styles of fashion, art, and music that 
elevated and celebrated African and Black 
beauty, political purpose, and pride; 
Whereas the Harlem Cultural Festival of 
1969 captured the spirit of the Black Power 
movement, as this festival— 
(1) marked the first time many of these 
artists had performed for such a large, pre-
dominately Black crowd; and 
(2) was multi-generational, as the older 
generation of gospel and blues artists invited 
the younger generation of soul, jazz, funk, 
rock, and pop artists to join in their per-
formances; 
Whereas the Harlem Cultural Festival 
showcased Black art and music from around 
the United States, including Mahalia Jack-
son, who sang her unique style of gospel 
rooted in the Deep South (especially Mis-
sissippi and Texas) and influenced by the 
blues and jazz that surrounded her in New 
Orleans, Louisiana, and B.B. King, who sang 
the Blues, a genre rooted in New Orleans 
that spread throughout the South, whose 
performances mingled with the jazz, pop, 
soul, and psychedelic funk sets of the young-
er artists; 
Whereas the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival 
may have inspired similar movements, such 
as the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Fes-
tival, which was first organized in 1970 to 
preserve and promote the music, culture, and 
heritage of the people of Louisiana; 
Whereas the 1970 New Orleans Jazz and 
Heritage Festival featured renowned Black 
artists such as Mahalia Jackson, Duke 
Ellington, Peter Fountain, and Al Hirt; 
Whereas the New Orleans Jazz and Herit-
age Festival continues to showcase the rich 
musical heritage of Louisiana as it has con-
tinued to grow in popularity; 
Whereas the Harlem Cultural Festival was 
a way to show that Harlem was more than 
the riots that rocked it in the prior years 
and was a coming together of unlikely allies, 
with Black Panthers providing security for 
the event and a Republican New York City 
Mayor enthusiastically supporting the fes-
tival as a peaceful moment after the violence 
that followed the assassination of Rev. Dr. 
Martin Luther King; 
Whereas the memory of the Harlem Cul-
tural Festival was rescued and resuscitated 
by the internationally acclaimed 2021 docu-
mentary ‘‘Summer of Soul (. . . Or When the 
Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’’, which 
compiled over 40 hours of concert video of 
the 
festival 
recorded 
by 
director 
Hal 
Tulchin; 
Whereas ‘‘Summer of Soul (. . . Or When 
the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’’ 
highlights the cultural and political impacts 
of this festival by juxtaposing footage from 
the 1969 festival with modern-day interviews 
and voiceovers about the political environ-
ment at the time of the festival; 
Whereas ‘‘Summer of Soul (. . . Or When 
the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)’’ 
won an Oscar for ‘‘Best Original Documen-
tary’’ at the 94th Academy Awards on March 
26, 2022, and a Grammy award for ‘‘Best 
Music Film’’ at the 64th Annual Grammy 
Awards Ceremony on April 3, 2022, which 
brought further attention and acclaim to the 
performances at the 1969 Harlem Cultural 
Festival; and 
Whereas the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival 
and the 1970 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage 
Festival 
represent 
historic 
moments 
in 
Black cultural history: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the last weekend of June 2022 
to commemorate the first weekend of the 
Harlem Cultural Festival of 1969 and the first 
full weekend of May to commemorate the 
final weekend of the New Orleans Jazz and 
Heritage Festival of 1970; 
(2) recognizes the contributions of the Har-
lem Cultural Festival of 1969 and the New Or-
leans Jazz and Heritage Festival of 1970 to 
Black art and culture; 
(3) encourages Senators to plan appro-
priate activities that support the objectives 
of the Harlem Cultural Festival of 1969 and 
the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival 
of 1970; and 
(4) encourages local governments in the 
United States to build partnerships with 
local Black artists, performers, and activists 
to further uplift Black culture and art and 
promote equal treatment of all people.

SENATE RESOLUTION 648—DESIG-
NATING MAY 2022 AS ‘‘NATIONAL 
BRAIN 
TUMOR 
AWARENESS 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. DAINES (for himself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Ms. SINEMA, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. 
KELLY, and Ms. WARREN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 648 
Whereas more than an estimated 88,970 in-
dividuals will be diagnosed with a primary 
brain tumor in the United States in 2022, and 
an estimated 84,000 individuals in the United 
States were diagnosed with a primary brain 
tumor in 2021; 
Whereas an estimated 700,000 individuals 
are living with a brain tumor in the United 
States; 
Whereas in the United States, brain tu-
mors are the— 
(1) leading cause of death from cancer in 
children who are under 14 years of age and 
teens who are under 19 years of age; and 
(2) second leading cause of death from can-
cer in young adults who are between 15 and 
39 years of age; 
Whereas the average 5-year survival rate 
for an individual in the United States fol-
lowing the diagnosis of a primary malignant 
brain tumor is only 35.6 percent; 
Whereas it is estimated that 18,200 individ-
uals in the United States will die as a result 
of a malignant brain tumor in 2022; 
Whereas brain tumors may be malignant 
or benign but can be life-threatening in ei-
ther case; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, approximately 700,000 indi-
viduals in the United States are living with 
a brain tumor; 
Whereas treatment of brain tumors is com-
plicated by the fact that more than 100 types 
of brain tumors exist; 
Whereas the treatment and removal of 
brain tumors present significant challenges 
due to the uniquely complex and fragile na-
ture of the brain; 
Whereas brain tumors affect the primary 
organ in the human body that controls not 
only cognitive ability, but the actions of 
every other organ and limb in the body, lead-
ing to brain tumors being described as a dis-
ease that affects the whole individual; 
Whereas brain tumor research is supported 
by a number of private, nonprofit research 
foundations and by Federal medical research 
institutions;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2668 
May 24, 2022 
Whereas basic research may fuel advance-
ments and development of new treatments 
for brain tumors; 
Whereas obstacles to the development of 
new treatments for brain tumors remain, 
and there are limited strategies for the 
screening or early detection of brain tumors; 
Whereas, despite the high number of indi-
viduals diagnosed with a brain tumor every 
year and the devastating prognoses for those 
individuals, only 5 drugs and 1 medical de-
vice are approved by the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration to treat primary brain tumors; 
Whereas the mortality rates associated 
with brain tumors have changed little during 
the 30-year period preceding the date of in-
troduction of this resolution; 
Whereas there is a need for greater public 
awareness of brain tumors, including the dif-
ficulties associated with research on brain 
tumors and the opportunities for advances in 
brain tumor research and treatment; and 
Whereas May 2022, during which brain 
tumor advocates nationwide unite in aware-
ness, outreach, and advocacy activities, is an 
appropriate month to recognize as ‘‘National 
Brain 
Tumor 
Awareness 
Month’’: 
Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates May 2022 as ‘‘National Brain 
Tumor Awareness Month’’; 
(2) encourages increased public awareness 
of brain tumors to honor the individuals who 
have lost their lives to a brain tumor or cur-
rently live with a brain tumor diagnosis; 
(3) supports efforts to develop better treat-
ments for brain tumors that will improve the 
quality of life and the long-term prognoses of 
individuals diagnosed with a brain tumor; 
(4) expresses its support for individuals 
who are battling brain tumors, as well as the 
families, friends, and caregivers of those in-
dividuals; and 
(5) urges a collaborative approach to brain 
tumor research, which is a promising means 
of advancing understanding of, and treat-
ment for, brain tumors.

ROBB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
SHOOTING 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we are nearing the end of the ses-
sion, when we will go back to our 
homes for the evening, but when the 
families of 18 children and 4 great edu-
cators go home tonight, their homes 
will never be the same again. 
There are no words in a place filled 
with words during today and every day 
in this place when we are in session. 
There are no words today to capture 
the 
heartbreak, 
the 
gut-wrenching 
grief and pain that those families will 
feel and that I remember feeling al-
most 10 years ago when we stood in the 
space just outside the firehouse in 
Sandy Hook, as parents learned that 
their 20 children would not be coming 
home that night. 
The same bottomless grief is hitting 
the families in Texas, in Uvalde, where 
they have lost children. And there are 
no words also to capture the deep, abid-
ing pain that will last forever. That 
pain will be with them—a hole in their 
hearts, a place at their tables, a room 
in their houses that never will be filled 
again, and hugs that they will never 
feel, cheeks that will never be kissed. 
This Nation, like their families, is 
torn apart by violence—needless, sense-
less gun violence—every day in Amer-
ica. And the mystery is why the great-
est Nation on Earth continues to tol-
erate it. It is no longer surprising or 
stunning. It is no longer unfathomable 
or unforeseeable. 
It is incomprehensible that this great 
Nation is blocked by Members of this 
body from taking action that can fore-
stall and prevent it. Why, the outrage 
that we feel, the grief that pervades 
America on these occasions has not 
caused action. And this body has been 
complicit by its inaction. In fact, it 
isn’t this body. It is Members of this 
body, principally on the other side of 
the aisle. Let’s be blunt. I will never 
forget hearing from that gallery those 
words: ‘‘Shame. Shame on you,’’ when 
we failed to adopt commonsense meas-
ures—a background check proposal, 
even though we had 55 votes. I can still 
hear those words. ‘‘Shame.’’ 
And had we acted, who knows what 
tragedy could have been averted? We 
don’t know and we can’t tell and we 
never will be able to fathom whether

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2670 
May 24, 2022 
specific measures would have pre-
vented specific tragedy. Charleston or 
San Bernardino, Pulse or Las Vegas, 
Parkland or Santa Fe, or Pittsburgh or 
El Paso or Dayton or Boulder or Indi-
anapolis 
or 
Oxford 
or 
Buffalo 
or 
Uvalde—we will never know because 
the false reason to object is this meas-
ure 
wouldn’t 
have 
prevented 
that 
shooting. 
But that is not the way to approach 
gun violence reform, because we know 
there is no panacea; there is no single 
measure. What we know is that stop-
ping gun violence requires that we act 
with these measures and that common-
sense, sensible steps can prevent a 
senseless, needless violence. 
There is no panacea, but there are ac-
tions we can take. We are not without 
agency. 
Now, we need to be very blunt and 
recognize that opposition to these 
measures is bankrolled and emboldened 
and enabled by the gun lobby’s dark 
money, by its threats and intimida-
tion, by its encouragement. 
And until my colleagues have the 
courage to stand up to that gun lobby, 
they will continue in its thrall and its 
grip, and they will continue to be 
complicit. 
And some on our side, some who have 
demonstrated the courage to stand up 
and speak out, have shown that we 
have the power to take action. 
We lack facts about the shooter and 
about 
the 
killing, 
all 
the 
cir-
cumstances in Uvalde, but we know 
enough to say that those families and 
that community will be torn apart. It 
will never be the same. They will never 
be whole again because they have lost 
something precious, and there will al-
ways be that hole in their hearts. 
Already some of our Republican col-
leagues are saying we are politicizing 
the issue, but they are the ones who, 
for decades, have tied themselves to 
the NRA’s fanatical devotion to unre-
stricted, unyielding firearms ownership 
for political purposes at the expense of 
real lives. 
Tying themselves to firearms owner-
ship is unnecessary for law-abiding 
citizens to own firearms. There are 
commonsense actions we can take to 
separate dangerous killers from fire-
arms that are absolutely consistent 
with the Second Amendment, as judged 
by the Supreme Court, and absolutely 
consistent with gun ownership by law- 
abiding people. 
We know these actions won’t save ev-
eryone, but there can be no doubt that 
each of them will save some lives: ex-
panding background checks and closing 
glaring loopholes in our background 
check 
system; 
getting 
untraceable 
ghost guns and military-style assault 
weapons off our streets; protecting do-
mestic violence survivors from gun vio-
lence; keeping guns out of the hands of 
domestic terrorists and violent extrem-
ists and individuals who are dangerous 
to themselves or others, red flag stat-
utes; preventing kids from accidentally 
and unintentionally shooting them-
selves 
with 
unsecured 
firearms, 
Ethan’s Law for safe storage; investing 
in community violence intervention 
programs—we know they work in Hart-
ford, New Haven, all around the State 
of Connecticut; reducing the number of 
firearm suicides—more than half of all 
gun deaths are suicides; red flag stat-
utes, separating firearms from people 
who are dangerous to themselves as 
well as others. 
We need to do all these things and 
more. We need to do them right now 
because every day that passes without 
action means more of the same. Not 
surprising, not stunning—more of the 
same. 
Those measures are written, they are 
fully drafted, vetted for their constitu-
tionality. My subcommittee on the 
Constitution has had hearings on them, 
many of them: S. 529, the Background 
Check Expansion Act; S. 591, the Back-
ground Check Completion Act; S. 1558, 
the Untraceable Firearms Act to stop 
ghost guns; S. 736, the Assault Weapons 
Ban; S. 527, the Protecting Domestic 
Violence and Stalking Victims Act; S. 
2169, the Lori Jackson-Nicolette Elias 
Domestic Violence Survivor Protection 
Act, a hearing just last week on it; S. 
2090, the Disarm Hate Act; S. 4278, the 
Age 21 Act; S. 190, Ethan’s Law; S. 2982, 
the Child Suicide Prevention and Le-
thal Means Safety Act; S. 1819, the Ex-
treme Risk Protection Order Act—the 
red flag statutes. 
Let us do one of them. Let us vote to 
make one of them law. That is our job: 
to vote. It is how we change this gut- 
wrenching, heartbreaking status quo, 
and it is how voters know where each 
of us stand when push comes to shove. 
So we have no words, but words will 
mean nothing without action. We have 
created a political movement. It is a 
movement that is growing as young 
people say: Enough is enough, as the 
hand wringing and the tears are trans-
lated into action at the grassroots 
level, action by State legislatures. Al-
most 20 states now have red flag stat-
utes in the wake of Parkland. And as 
communities and States show that 
they will no longer tolerate the hypoc-
risy of thoughts and prayers without 
action, all of us who have advocated for 
years—indeed, for decades—that this 
body must act, we cannot lose courage 
or heart. We cannot lose the hope, and 
we must match our thoughts and pray-
ers with real action.

JOHN CHRISTMAN 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of attending a cere-
mony where World War II veteran John 
Christman was presented a Congressional 
Gold Medal. John is one of the nine surviving 
veterans who served as a soldier in the U.S. 
Army’s 23rd Headquarters Special Troops tac-
tical deception unit, more popularly known as 
the ‘‘Ghost Army.’’ This 1,100-man unit has a 
very unique mission. The Ghost Army’s mis-
sion is to impersonate other Allied Army units 
in order to deceive our enemy. The Ghost 
Army has staged more than 20 battlefield de-
ceptions, often operating very close to the 
front lines. I would like to thank John for the 
bravery and selflessness that he displayed 
while serving our country in the Ghost Army. 
God Bless John, and I thank him for his exem-
plary service, and God Bless our America.

HONORING THE OPENING OF THE

Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, we are 
proud to recognize the ribbon cutting and 
grand opening of the Ocala VA Clinic on June 
22, 2022. This clinic is a tremendous triumph 
for our veteran community in North Central 
Florida and will serve thousands of veterans 
with excellent care. This project has been a 
long-time coming and I am pleased to see its 
completion. Congratulations to the North Flor-
ida/South Georgia Veterans Health System on 
another job well done on behalf of our Na-
tion’s heroes.

HONORING GREG JASEK AND THE 
HIGHLAND COMMUNITY BAND’S 
30TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I take this 
time to recognize the 30th anniversary of the 
Highland Community Band and to honor Greg 
Jasek, principal conductor. Due to the global 
pandemic, the anniversary celebration was 
cancelled in 2020, but a concert and presen-
tation will take place this year on Thursday, 
May 26, 2022, at Main Square Park in High-
land, Indiana. 
Born and raised in the Hegewisch neighbor-
hood of Chicago, Greg Jasek first heard the 
siren’s call of music in third grade when he 
began taking trumpet lessons. Those lessons 
were supplemented with visits to Chicago 
Symphony Orchestra performances, as well as 
watching Leonard Bernstein on television. He 
continued his studies in conducting with Mi-
chael Morgan, then-assistant conductor of the 
Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Later, he was 
accepted to Tanglewood, which is the summer 
home of the Boston Symphony. While at 
Tanglewood, Greg studied with noted conduc-
tors such as Andre Previn, Leonard Slatkin, 
Maurice Abravanel, John Williams, and Leon-
ard Bernstein. 
In 1991, Greg became assistant conductor 
for the Northwest Indiana Youth Symphony 
Orchestra, and in 1992, he was named cover 
conductor for the International Arts Chamber 
Orchestra. By 1994, Greg arrived at Carnegie 
Hall to attend the Solti Orchestra Project; how-
ever, Maestro Georg Solti had a different plan 
in mind and asked Greg to assist with the Bar-
tok Concerto for Orchestra during recording 
sessions for London-Decca. Subsequently, 
Maestro Solti and Greg collaborated in the or-
chestration of Bartok’s Romanian Christmas 
Carols. 
Prior to these outstanding achievements, 
Greg had already begun to make what would 
prove to be an indelible mark on the Highland 
community. It was in 1989 that a young bari-
tone player named Michael Griffin approached 
Greg Jasek with an idea to begin a community 
band in Highland, Indiana. Musicians from 
Northwest Indiana and Northeastern Illinois 
gathered together, and the Highland Commu-
nity Band gave its first concert in July 1990. 
As fate would have it, Greg met his wife, 
Kerry, a flute player in the band, during this 
time. The couple would later add two wonder-
ful children, Benjamin and Samuel, to their 
family. 
In 2011, Greg was initiated into the Sigma 
Alpha Iota International Music Fraternity as a 
National Arts Associate, which is a national 
recognition for distinguished contribution to the 
arts. Later, in 2021, in recognition of his 30 
years as principal conductor of the Highland 
Community Band, Greg was honored with the 
Distinguished Hoosier Award by Indiana Gov-
ernor Eric Holcomb. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring Greg Jasek and in celebrating the 30th 
Anniversary of the Highland Community Band. 
For his musical influence and innovation and 
his dedication to the community of Northwest 
Indiana and beyond, Greg Jasek is one man 
who most truly can be called maestro, and he 
is worthy of our admiration and the highest 
commendation.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PAUL

HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, in honor of the life of Paul Joseph 
Ianni, I include in the RECORD the following let-
ter written by his former platoon leader during 
the Vietnam war, Brice H. Barnes. 
TO THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF SGT PAUL 
IANNI: It has been brought to my attention 
by a fellow Veteran, Mr. Russ Vibberts, that 
our mutual friend, Mr. Paul Ianni, has 
transitioned from this world and now rests 
in the Mighty Arms of our Savior. In 1967, I 
had the distinct honor of being Paul’s Pla-
toon Leader in Vietnam, and knew him as a 
gentleman and professional soldier. Paul was 
highly instrumental in our successful exploi-
tation of the largest ammunition and weap-
ons cache ever discovered in the entire Viet-
nam War, as a volunteer that explored the 
vast underground tunnel and storage com-
plex. His reports to me were accurate and 
thorough, enabling us to successfully com-
plete the mission as assigned. For his ac-
tions, I nominated Paul for the Bronze Star

Medal for meritorious service. Later in his 
tour of duty, Paul participated in another 
significant battle during the Tet Counter-of-
fensive in Vietnam. At the risk of personal 
injury or death, Paul delivered highly effec-
tive fire upon several enemy positions, 
thereby enabling his platoon to advance and 
occupy security positions that guarded a 
vital road intersection. It is without doubt 
that Paul’s actions saved the lives of many 
of his fellow platoon members. As a result of 
his actions, Paul was awarded the Silver 
Star, our Nation’s third highest award for 
valor and bravery in combat operations. One 
of his other awards was the Combat Infan-
tryman’s Badge, the most prestigious award 
ever to be bestowed upon an Infantryman. 
On some rare occasions, I was able to tele-
phonically visit with Paul, and always 
thanked him for his service, and for making 
me a better leader of other Warriors. Al-
though news of his passing has brought me 
some personal sadness, I am rejoicing that 
he is now free of the prejudices and pain that 
he experienced, and will enjoy the peace and 
freedom that he so richly deserved.

GUPPI 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of attending the offi-
cial storefront opening of Guppi in Wildwood, 
New Jersey. Driven by a young entrepreneur, 
Abby, Guppi aspires to reduce the plastics 
that pollute our oceans by creating eco-friend-
ly apparel, bags, knick-knacks. Since launch-
ing her brand in 2018, Abby has created all 
her products by hand via screen-printing with 
ecofriendly inks and embroidering with threads 
made from recycled plastics. I am so im-
pressed by Abby’s work ethic, as well as her 
continued commitment to make our South Jer-
sey community a safer and more eco-friendly 
environment. Abby truly exemplifies ambition, 
and I am excited to watch Guppi continue to 
grow. God bless Abby and all the other hard-
working employees at Guppi, and God Bless 
our America.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO DES-
IGNATE THE FACILITY OF THE 
UNITED STATES POSTAL SERV-
ICE LOCATED AT 400 SOUTHERN 
AVENUE SOUTHEAST IN WASH-
INGTON, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
AS THE ‘‘DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
SERVICEMEMBERS 
AND 
VET-
ERANS POST OFFICE’’ 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce a bill that would name the post of-
fice at 400 Southern Avenue SE in the District 
of Columbia as the ‘‘District of Columbia 
Servicemembers and Veterans Post Office.’’ 
While it is important that our country honor 
all servicemembers and veterans, our country 
owes a special debt of gratitude to D.C. 
servicemembers and veterans, who serve or 
have served their country without voting rep-
resentation in Congress or full local self-gov-
ernment. It is remarkable that they serve a 
country that denies them basic democratic 
rights—rights they have often been sent over-
seas to defend. 
D.C. residents have served in every war 
since the Revolutionary War. There are ap-
proximately 30,000 veterans who live in D.C., 
and almost 200,000 D.C. residents have 
served in the military since World War I. This 
bill is one way to recognize their service and 
sacrifice. Six hundred thirty-five D.C. residents 
were casualties of World War I, a casualty fig-
ure greater than that of three different States 
during that war. Three thousand five hundred 
seventy-five D.C. residents were casualties of 
World War II, a casualty figure greater than 
that of four different States during that war. 
Five hundred forty-seven D.C. residents were 
casualties of the Korean war, a casualty figure 
greater than that of eight different States dur-
ing that war. Two hundred forty-three D.C. 
residents were casualties of the Vietnam war, 
a casualty figure greater than that of 10 dif-
ferent States during that war. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
THELMA C. CHILDERS 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the outstanding life and service of 
Thelma C. Childers. 
Thelma was born on March 31, 1922, in 
Clover, South Carolina. Her doctor told her 
mother she would not live past the age of 2 
due to a heart murmur, but Thelma proved 
that doctor wrong and just celebrated her 
100th birthday. 
Raised on a farm by a single mother, Thel-
ma understands the value of hard work. Dur-
ing the day, her mother worked as a makeup 
artist at the local cemetery, and at night, she 
tended to the cows and other farm animals. 
Despite growing up during the Great Depres-
sion, Thelma never knew she was poor—she 
just knew she was happy and loved. 
Thelma was married to the late Joe Childers 
for over 50 years. Joe was in the Navy and 
fought in the South Pacific during World War 
II. Throughout their joyful and prosperous mar-
riage, Thelma helped Joe run his own life in-
surance business. The two were also big sup-
porters of St. Jude Children’s Hospital and 
members of the Travelers Protection Associa-
tion, an organization that helps communities 
through travel safety issues, children safety 
programs, and various community service 
projects. 
A proud mother, grandmother, and great- 
grandmother, Thelma is the epitome of a fam-
ily matriarch. After attending Northside Baptist 
Church for most of her life, she now enjoys at-
tending Eastside Baptist Church with her 
grandson Justin as often as she is able. 
Thelma’s secret to her health and long life 
is ‘‘working hard in my yard, because all I 
have known my whole life is hard work and 
hard work hasn’t ever hurt nobody.’’ In addi-
tion to spending time with her family, her true 
passion is spending time outside digging in 
her flower beds. 
On behalf of the Fifth District of South Caro-
lina, it is my most sincere pleasure to recog-
nize and celebrate the incredible life of Thel-
ma Childers. May her life continue to be filled 
with joy, good health, and family.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE TIFERETH ISRAEL 
CONGREGATION 
OF 
NEW 
BED-
FORD 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of the 100th anniversary of the 
Tifereth Israel Congregation of New Bedford, 
Massachusetts. 
As the Jewish population of New Bedford 
grew in the 1920s, so did the need for a new 
synagogue. On November 17, 1921, the 
Tifereth Israel Congregation was chartered 
and has continued to serve the Greater New 
Bedford area for over 100 years. The original 
Tifereth Israel Synagogue still stands at 42 
South Sixth Street; however, in 1966, during a 
two-week celebration, elders of the congrega-
tion moved sacred Torahs to the newly con-
structed synagogue on Brownell Avenue with 
over 800 people attending the dedication cere-
monies. 
Today, the Tifereth Israel Congregation re-
mains a pillar of the community offering a vari-
ety of programs, including Bar and Bat Mitz-
vah classes, the Minyan Breakfast Club, the 
United Youth Program, as well as the Tifereth 
Israel Sisterhood and Men’s Club. The Tifereth 
Israel Congregation—currently led by Rabbi 
Raphael Kanter, who has served as the con-
gregation’s spiritual leader since 1997—is 
known for being a kind and welcoming place 
of worship, promoting the message of respect-
ing all, even when beliefs may differ. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor the 
100th anniversary of the Tifereth Israel Con-
gregation. I ask that my colleagues join me in 
thanking them for their invaluable service and 
wishing them all the best in the many years to 
come.

DOGS OF HONOR 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of attending the 
New Jersey Dogs of Honor graduation in Mau-
rice River Township, South Jersey. New Jer-
sey Dogs of Honor started with a dog named 
Gunnar, who was the service dog of Diana 
Pitman, a former army nurse dealing with 
post-traumatic stress. Through Gunnar, Diana 
learned first-hand how a service dog can 
change a veteran’s life. Diana then collabo-
rated with Ted’s Pet Country Club and Patti 
and Gordon Gross to establish New Jersey 
Dogs of Honor. Since then, these service dogs 
have been changing the lives of veterans in 
the South Jersey community by performing 
tasks to help veterans with disabilities. At the 
graduation this month, Meet, King, and 
Maggie all graduated and will now accompany 
three of our nation’s veterans. God Bless both 
these dogs and veterans, and God Bless our 
United States of America.

HONORING UNIVERSITY OF 
FLORIDA’S PRESIDENT DR. FUCHS 
HON. KAT CAMMACK 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I honor 
the service of Dr. Kent Fuchs, the 12th Presi-
dent of the University of Florida, who will be 
retiring later this year. Dr. Fuchs has served 
for 37 years as an academic leader and fac-
ulty member at four different national research 
and land-grant universities, including the Uni-
versity of Florida in my district where his lead-
ership and support will be sorely missed. 
Dr. Fuchs has been a steward for public 
good and will go down in Florida’s history as 
a testament to public service. Founded to 
serve the citizens of a growing state, the Uni-
versity of Florida (UF) has since become one 
of the nation’s top public universities. 
Born on an Oklahoma farm in 1954, Presi-
dent Fuchs spent much of his youth in Alaska 
before moving to Miami, where he graduated 
from Miami Killian Senior High School. Dr. 
Fuchs eventually made Florida his home, 
where his indelible impact is seen to this day. 
During his tenure, UF has become a na-
tional leader in preparing the next generation 
of students for success. It was always his be-
lief that public higher education was the incu-
bator for personal growth and scholastic en-
richment. Today, the University continues to 
be one of the most affordable universities in 
the nation, with UF’s average cost of attend-
ance lowest of the top 10 public universities. 
With his personal warmth, sense of humor and 
affection for students—personified in his an-
nual April Fools’ pranks and friendly, light-
hearted presence on social media—Dr. Fuchs 
has become a beloved figure on campus, with 
students lining up to take selfies with him 
wherever he goes. 
Most notably during his tenure, the univer-
sity reached its longtime goal of joining the na-
tion’s top public universities, rising to join the 
top five in 2021. 
Dr. Fuchs has strived to ensure Florida’s 
bright future. In 2020, UF announced a 
groundbreaking partnership with NVIDIA that 
will catapult UF’s research strength and build 
a workforce trained in the tools of Artificial In-
telligence (AI). UF’s creation of a model for 
addressing society’s grand challenges through 
interdisciplinary collaboration is positioning 
Florida as a global leader in AI and attracting 
more high-wage jobs and industry to our state. 
Today, UF has 4,642 full-time faculty, up 
more than 25 percent from 2014. Faculty have 
steadily increased their research excellence 
with research spending projected to approach 
$1 billion this fiscal year. Under Dr. Fuchs’ 
leadership, UF’s faculty and staff have en-
hanced the university’s educational, research, 
extension and clinical excellence, by increas-
ing public and private financial support—all 
progress that continued despite the challenges 
of the pandemic in the past two years. 
Over his long and distinguished career, Dr. 
Fuchs was appointed by President Obama to 
the National Science Board and served on the 
Internet2, Association of American Universities 
and Association of Public and Land-grant Uni-
versities boards of directors. He is a fellow of 
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers, and the Association for 
Computing Machinery, and has received nu-
merous awards for teaching and research. 
President Fuchs earned his doctorate in elec-
trical and computer engineering from the Uni-
versity of Illinois, and a Master of Divinity from 
Trinity Evangelical Divinity School. 
On behalf of the Florida Congressional Del-
egation in the U.S. House of Representatives 
in the 117th Congress, we want to congratu-
late Dr. Kent Fuchs on his retirement after 
eight years of service with the University of 
Florida and thank him for his of public service 
to Florida and our Nation.

RECOGNIZING MRS. ALICIA CONDE 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Mrs. Alicia Conde for her 26 
years of service to the Shafter-Wasco Irriga-
tion District. 
Since 1992, Mrs. Conde has served as a 
dedicated public servant, working tirelessly on 
behalf of the Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District. 
She has done critical work, such as over-
seeing the annual district crop survey pro-
gram, managing the water billing and District 
Exempt Land Assessment tax installments, 
and maintaining the district’s correspondence. 
For decades, Mrs. Conde has been the first 
point of contact for anybody with business in 
the district. She has long been an excellent 
representative of the district, and a welcoming 
presence for those coming into the office. She 
has built longstanding relationships with land-
owners in the area and guided many of them 
through difficult regulatory changes over her 
years of service. 
The loyalty and commitment to service by 
Mrs. Conde has been an inspiration to us all. 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in recognizing Mrs. 
Alicia Conde for her decades of public service 
and contributions to the Central Valley com-
munity.

Mr. GOODEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the leadership and commit-
ment of Dr. Coy Holcombe, who serves the 
Fifth District of Texas as Superintendent of 
Eustace ISD. An essential figure and true 
asset to our community, Dr. Holcombe is retir-
ing after 21 years of service. 
Dr. Holcombe began his career as an edu-
cator and coach in 1984 before joining 
Eustace ISD in 2001. His brilliance in finance 
and his leadership skills have not gone unno-
ticed in the community, especially during the 
trials of COVID–19. Dr. Holcombe has suc-
cessfully maintained a healthy fund balance 
within the school district and navigated the 
community through student population growth 
over the years. His leadership during the pan-
demic was stellar in ensuring students’ edu-
cation, health, and well-being were properly 
monitored and prioritized. His dedication to 
every student within Eustace ISD will leave a 
legacy of excellence and compassion in the 
Fifth District of Texas. 
I commend Dr. Coy Holcombe for his com-
mitment to the students and families of 
Eustace ISD and for 21 years of hard work 
and service as Superintendent.

where he earned a bachelor’s degree. 
After graduating, Earl settled in South Lou-
isiana. In 1967, he founded King Trucking, Inc. 
near Morgan City, Louisiana. The business 
has provided professional trucking services for 
over 55 years. As a member of the Louisiana

Earl 
worked 
with 
local 
businessowners to advance the economic in-
terests of St. Mary Parish.

ing been appointed by two Governors and 
having served as chairman for one year. He 
was a board member for the Louisiana Shrimp

He enjoyed hunting and fishing. He loved 
his LSU Tigers, and above all, spending time 
with his family. 
A beloved husband and father, Earl left this 
earthly existence and shed his mortal coil on 
April 13, 2022, at the age of 77.

FREDRICK JOHN NAHAS II, M.D. 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize the lifelong achievements of 
Fredrick John Nahas II. Dr. Nahas moved to 
Margate, South Jersey as a young boy and 
graduated from Atlantic City High School in 
1964. In high school, he was a South Jersey 
swimming champion and was recruited to 
swim at the University of Pennsylvania, where 
he earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical en-
gineering. After graduating from University of 
Pennsylvania, Dr. Nahas followed in his fa-
ther’s footsteps and pursued his career as an 
electrical engineer working on the Apollo 
Moon Project in Florida. He then continued his 
education and graduated from Temple Univer-
sity School of Medicine in 1974. After years of 
hard work, Dr. Nahas opened his own practice 
in 1978 and became a board-certified surgeon 
in 1980. Since then, he has maintained certifi-
cations in both general and vascular surgery. 
Currently, he works at his solo practice in 
South Jersey and enjoys spending time with 
his six grandchildren. Dr. Nahas should be 
proud of all of his achievements, and it is my 
pleasure 
to 
recognize 
him. 
God 
Bless 
Fredrick, and God Bless our America.

Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the upcoming retirement of 
Kent Lopez as General Manager of the Wash-
ington Rural Electric Cooperative Association. 
For nearly 17 years, Kent has diligently rep-
resented the interests of these 14 not-for-prof-
it, rural electric coops and has advocated for 
the interests of consumer-owned utilities for 
more than 40 years. 
Whether it’s my home co-op of Benton REA 
in Central Washington, Okanogan County 
Electric and Nespelem Valley Electric to our 
north; or Big Bend Electric just next door, Kent 
has dutifully executed his charge of ensuring 
that hundreds of thousands of rural Washing-
tonians have access to the affordable, reliable, 
and abundant renewable cost-based benefits 
of the Federal Columbia River Power Sys-
tem—a system critically important to the well- 
being of the Pacific Northwest. 
But come July 1st, Kent will hang up his 
coat and focus on the long ‘‘honey-do’’ list his 
lovely wife Cindy has ready for him. 
I wish Kent good luck in retirement; he has 
earned it.

IN RECOGNITION OF ARGO 
COMMUNITY HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. MARIE NEWMAN 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the critical work by the Argo 
Community High School administration to pro-
mote equity in their school. Argo Community 
High School is making history by erecting a 
bronze sculpture honoring the life and work of 
Mamie Till, the mother of Emmett Till and a 
graduate of Argo Community High School. 
Mamie Till’s brave decision to hold an open 
casket funeral following the brutal lynching of 
her son provided a spark for the civil rights 
movement and brought lynching to the fore-
front of social conversation. 
Argo Community High School’s efforts to im-
plement this project will serve as a road map 
for other communities to infuse equity in edu-
cation. Through collaboration with individuals 
such as Reverend Wheeler Parker and Ollie 
Gordon, Emmett Till’s cousins, to design the 
sculpture, Argo Community High School has 
incorporated the surrounding community into 
their project. Additionally, students have been 
an integral part of the process, and are cur-
rently documenting stories of living Till family 
members as well as community members who 
knew Mamie and Emmett Till. I am proud of 
Argo Community High School’s leadership to 
uplift our civil rights heroes as we educate the 
next generation of American leaders. 
I commend the Argo Community High 
School administration for educating their stu-
dents about our nation’s history through the 
Mamie Till Memorial Sculpture. This sculpture 
will serve as a catalyst for immediate and con-
tinued education of students at Argo Commu-
nity High School as well as members of the 
Argo-Summit community around the issues of 
social justice and civil rights. I thank Dr. Wil-
liam Toulios and Dr. Brandon Cotter for their 
leadership and am honored to have such out-
standing educators in my district.

HONORING 
DR. 
MARIA 
ELOISA 
ALBAY DE PADUA AS A DISTIN-
GUISHED LEADER IN CENTRAL 
FLORIDA FOR ASIAN AMERICAN 
AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HERIT-
AGE MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Maria Eloisa 
Albay de Padua, MD, is the longest-serving 
physician in Central Florida Health Care, a 
non-profit federally qualified community health 
care center. 
After finishing her education in the Phil-
ippines, Dr. de Padua immigrated to the 
United States of America and did her resi-
dency at the Children’s Hospital of Buffalo. 
After learning about CFHC’s mission to help 
migrant workers and the underserved 27 years 
ago, Dr. de Padua joined and never looked 
back. 
Going into medicine to help the sick and the 
most vulnerable, Dr. de Padua considered 
CFHC the perfect place to realize her dreams. 
Initially, she worked as a pediatrician for the 
Frostproof, Wauchula, and Avon Park Com-
munity Health Centers. Then, as CFHC began 
growing, Dr. de Padua helped start several 
other facilities by being one of the first pro-
viders in the Dundee, Mulberry, Lakeland, and 
Winter Haven Community Health Centers. 
As a pediatrician, Dr. de Padua treats sick 
children from birth to age 18. Her focus is on 
helping children stay healthy by ensuring they 
get their well checks and immunizations 
promptly. Having served the community for 27 
years, Dr. de Padua now has former patients 
who are parents, bringing their children to see 
her as patients. 
For Dr. de Padua, her greatest reward as a 
pediatrician is to see her patients grow from 
newborns to young students to college grad-
uates who then move on to become contrib-
uting members of society.

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF U.S.-QATAR 
DIPLOMATIC 
RELATIONS, 
MAY 
24, 2022 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
as a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on 
Qatar, it is with great pleasure that I congratu-
late both the United States and Qatar on the 
strong and deep-rooted relationship that has 
developed since the two countries established 
diplomatic relations fifty years ago. 
The bond between our two countries has 
never been stronger, thanks to our enduring 
partnership to address regional and global 
challenges. Bilateral cooperation between the 
U.S. and Qatar on trade, investment, climate 
change, education, humanitarian assistance, 
cultural exchanges and security collaboration 
have been expanded in recent years. 
This was underscored at the White House 
earlier this year when President Joe Biden 
hosted His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim 
bin Hamad al-Thani. In his welcoming remarks 
on January 31, 2022, President Biden de-
clared: ‘‘Qatar is a good friend, and a reliable 
and capable partner.’’ 
He reflected on the ‘‘fifty years of partner-
ship.’’ Specifically, he said, ‘‘this past year, our 
partnership with Qatar has been central to 
many of our most vital interests: relocating 
tens of thousands of Afghans; maintaining sta-
bility in Gaza and providing lifesaving assist-
ance to the Palestinians; keeping pressure on 
ISIS and deterring threats across the Middle 
East; and a lot more.’’ 
Our countries worked hand-in-hand on 
many vital priorities, such as the evacuating 
vulnerable Afghans under Taliban rule. The 
Qataris played a role that can never be forgot-
ten, by helping to evacuate and process thou-
sands of Afghans to Al Udeid Air Base. Addi-
tionally, in May of last year, the Qataris played 
a crucial role in negotiating a ceasefire be-
tween Israel and Gaza. We all must acknowl-
edge the critical role Qatar plays in stabilizing 
the world and saving countless lives. 
As a Member of the House Transportation 
and Infrastructure Committee, I was very en-
couraged to see both President Biden and the 
Amir welcome the signing of a $20 billion deal 
between Boeing and Qatar Airways. This is 
one of the largest deals that Boeing aircraft 
has ever had. It will support manufacturing 
jobs at Boeing, General Electric and hundreds 
of other suppliers across the U.S. and in 
Qatar. 
The highlight of our partnership is the des-
ignation of Qatar as a Major Non-NATO Ally 
(MNNA). Since Qatar already is home to the 
Al Udeid base, which is the largest in the re-
gion, and the CENTCOM regional head-
quarters, the new designation serves to rein-
force the existing security partnership between 
our two countries. 
It is important to note that the U.S.-Qatar re-
lationship encompasses far more than stra-
tegic cooperation. Our two nations have devel-
oped cultural partnerships designed to pro-
mote intellectual and intercultural dialogue, 
and build bridges between our countries. 
In addition, there are student exchanges 
from both nations, so that American students 
are able to study in Qatar, while Qatari stu-
dents are welcomed in the United States. 
Economic ties between Qatar and the U.S. 
have flourished over the last 50 years. The 
U.S. is Qatar’s largest foreign direct investor 
and second largest source of imports while 
Qatar also has invested billions of dollars in 
the U.S. leading to the creation of thousands 
of jobs in this country. 
The year marking the fiftieth anniversary of 
U.S. relations with Qatar began with the meet-
ing between President Biden and Amir al- 
Thani. It will end on another particularly event-
ful occasion when Qatar hosts the 2022 FIFA 
World Cup. It is an incredible accomplishment 
that an event of such international significance 
will be held in Qatar.

HONORING MR. CLAUDE BROWN OF 
THE UAW ON HIS 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and celebrate the 100th birthday of a 
resolute union organizer who has devoted his 
life to social justice and advocacy, Mr. Claude 
Brown. 
Claude was born on May 27, 1922, in the 
small town of Columbia, Tennessee. He faith-
fully served his country in the United States 
Army from 1943 until 1946. One decade later, 
on November 5, 1956, Claude began a new 
chapter of service when he was hired at The 
International Union, United Automobile, Aero-
space, and Agricultural Implement Workers of 
America (UAW) Local 652 in Lansing, Michi-
gan. 
Claude dedicated 31 years of his life to 
working at UAW Local 652, where he served 
as the first Civil Rights Committee Chairman. 
As Chairman, Claude played an essential role 
in advocating for historic legislation such as

Medicare, the Occupational Safety and Health 
Act, the Employee Retirement Act, and the 
Family and Medical Leave Act. Claude dedi-
cated his career to advocating for health care 
and pension benefits for retirees, policies to 
address the impacts of climate change, robust 
workplace health and safety standards, and 
better safety net protections like unemploy-
ment insurance laws. 
Claude has set an inspirational precedent 
for his successors while also inspiring his col-
leagues, community, and all those who had 
the pleasure of knowing him. Today, I want to 
honor Claude for his service and commitment 
to the UAW, and to celebrate the longevity of 
his life and the immense impact he has had 
on the Lansing community over the past cen-
tury. 
May we honor Claude for his willingness to 
go above and beyond the call of duty to fight 
for fair wages, benefits, and better working 
conditions for workers in Michigan and across 
this great nation. May these words stand as 
an enduring tribute to his many years of dedi-
cated service.

HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of attending the 
grand opening of the Complete Care Adult 
and Specialty Medical Professionals health 
center and corporate office in Bridgeton, South 
Jersey. The Complete Care Health Network 
began in 1973 as the Community Health Im-
provement Plan. Since then, Complete Care 
has grown to become the leading community 
health center in the state of New Jersey with 
a multitude of locations throughout Gloucester, 
Cumberland, and Cape May counties. The 
mission of the health center is to improve lives 
by providing convenient, comprehensive, high- 
quality healthcare to every community they 
serve. Complete Care Health Center truly 
does provide affordable and accessible care to 
the people of South Jersey. God Bless the

RECOGNIZING CHIEF WES 
HENSLEY 
HON. DAVID G. VALADAO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 24, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Chief Wes Hensley on 
his retirement from the Tulare Police Depart-
ment after 31 years of service. 
Chief Hensley began his service to the Cen-
tral Valley in 1984, starting as a police officer 
in the Visalia Police Department. Throughout 
his career, he has held multiple positions in 
different departments and sheriff’s offices. 
Over his three decades of service to his com-
munity, Chief Hensley climbed the ranks, 
achieving the positions of Corporal, Sergeant, 
Captain, and finally Chief of Police. 
Under his leadership, Chief Hensley has led 
the Tulare Police Department through unprec-
edented challenges, maintaining the respect 
and credibility of the Tulare Police throughout 
the community. His presence at the helm of 
the Department has been critical in advancing 
the goals of his officers and ensuring the safe-
ty of the community for all. 
Chief Hensley’s dedication, leadership, and 
commitment to excellence has been an incred-
ible model for all those who will follow him. His 
presence will be truly missed. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in recognizing Chief Wes Hensley for 
his lifetime of service to the Central Valley and 
congratulating him on his recent retirement.
