Let us pray. 
Our God, Creator of life, we come in 
thankfulness because You have loved 
us through all the days of our lives. We

ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of

clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the

Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this 
last Friday, we learned that U.S. em-
ployers added another 428,000 new jobs 
in the month of April. The unemploy-
ment rate is down to 3.6 percent, which 
is just about what it was before the 
pandemic struck. April marked the 
15th consecutive month of job growth 
under President Biden, and the United 
States has now recovered more than 90 
percent of the jobs that were lost dur-
ing the coronavirus pandemic. To put 
it into context, when President Biden 
took office, 20 million Americans relied 
on unemployment benefits just to get 
by. Now that number is down to slight-
ly more than 1 million—from 20 million 
to 1 million. 
This historic progress shows the re-
silience of American workers and small 
businesses that battled through more 
than 2 years of this unprecedented 
health crisis. This is truly an American 
success story. It is also the result of 
bold and decisive economic actions 
taken by the Democrats in Congress 
and President Biden. 
The American Rescue Plan you will 
remember well. It passed without a sin-
gle Republican voting in favor of it last 
year. That plan helped us get shots in 
the arms, and it provided economic re-
lief to small businesses and unem-
ployed Americans when they needed it 
the most. 
The bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and JOBS Act represented a his-
toric investment in America, in our 
Nation’s 
infrastructure—everything 
from roads and bridges to expanding 
broadband and access in underserved 
communities. This legislation is cre-
ating jobs. We see it in the report. It is 
helping America stay connected at

May 9, 2022 
home, at school, and with their doc-
tors, and it is allowing us to meet 21st 
century demands like climate change 
and cyber attacks. 
Even with last Friday’s good news, 
we still have more work to do to make 
sure we have an economy that really 
works for everyone. Too many Amer-
ican families are still struggling to pay 
the bills and afford the basics amid 
global inflation caused by President 
Putin’s unprovoked war in Ukraine and 
rising COVID cases in China that are 
disrupting our supply chains. 
Last 
week, 
the 
Federal 
Reserve 
raised interest rates by half a percent-
age point. That is the biggest rate hike 
in 22 years. They are trying to tamp 
down this inflationary pressure. We 
know, for many American families, a 
break in rising prices can’t come soon 
enough, but we also know that the root 
causes of this challenge are com-
plicated and that it will take a global 
effort and some good fortune for us to 
address it successfully. 
Democrats are committed to taking 
action to lower household costs and 
combat rising prices, get kids back to 
school, and workers back to work. We 
need to give families a helping hand 
when it comes to the basics: medica-
tion, housing, gas for your car or 
truck. We need to think ahead and 
begin preparing and investing now for 
future COVID surges so we can save 
lives and minimize the potential dis-
ruption to our supply chains and the 
economy. 
It is incredible to me, after what this 
Nation and world have gone through 
and continue to go through with over a 
million Americans having died from 
COVID, that we still are in a fierce de-
bate over whether we ought to prepare 
for the possibility that it could come 
back. We know it will. Sadly, it will. I 
hope it is in a manner that we can con-
trol. We believe, on the Democratic 
side, that we should ‘‘be prepared.’’ We 
weren’t prepared when it hit initially. 
With the statements by the former 
President that this was some sort of a 
hoax and that it would all disappear 
someday, we just lulled ourselves into 
thinking it wasn’t serious. Well, a mil-
lion American lives have been lost to 
prove just how serious it has been. We 
need to support workers and families— 
healthcare workers, too—and small 
businesses, like restaurants, that are 
the lifeblood of our economy. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
sit down and get real. We ought to face 
this public health issue for the reality 
that it is. We ought to face this econ-
omy with the challenges we face. We 
need to boost American manufacturing 
and jobs. We need to lower costs for 
families, and we need to insulate our 
economy against future COVID. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, the last few days 
have revealed a jarring contrast in 
human decency regarding the war in 
Ukraine. 
Yesterday, on Mother’s Day, First 
Lady Jill Biden visited the Ukrainian 
First 
Lady, 
Olena 
Zelenska, 
in 
Ukraine, in a moving display of soli-
darity with the Ukrainian people. 
This is an amazing photograph. It is 
a moment in history I am not sure any 
of us thought we would ever see. Here 
is our First Lady, who manages to fi-
nally meet with the First Lady of the 
President in Ukraine. There was some 
risk associated with it, but thank 
goodness, everything went well, and at 
the end of the day, the message was 
clear: America is standing by Ukraine. 
It is standing by the First Family of 
Ukraine with their amazing show of 
courage. 
The two First Ladies met at a school 
that was converted to help displaced 
Ukrainians because of the Russian on-
slaught. During her visit there and at 
stops just before in Romania and Slo-
vakia, Dr. Jill Biden met with Ukrain-
ian refugees, including many exhausted 
kids and parents who were on the verge 
of tears from the horrors that they had 
lived through. 
She poignantly remarked of her vis-
its in the three nations and said: 
I thought it was important to show the 
Ukrainian people that this war has to stop, 
and this war has been brutal. 
Now contrast that humane display, 
that display of human compassion and 
grace by the First Lady of the United 
States, with the actions of Russian war 
criminal Vladimir Putin yesterday and 
today. 
Over the weekend, Putin’s forces con-
tinued brutal assaults on civilian tar-
gets in Ukraine, including shelling a 
school used as a bomb shelter, which 
left 60 or more buried and presumed 
dead. Putin disgraced himself and the 
millions of Russians who suffered hor-
ribly during World War II by crudely 
comparing 
their 
struggle 
to 
his 
unprovoked, unconscionable assault on 
Ukraine. In cynically using Russia’s 
World War II Victory Day, Putin de-
scribed his war in Ukraine as ‘‘sacred’’ 
and necessary for the ‘‘security of our 
homeland.’’ This is delusional. It is 
Putin who is now acting in the same 
way as those who brutally attacked the 
Soviet Union during World War II. 
In one of my first visits to the Soviet 
Union as a person, as just a civilian on 
the street who went on a tour and then 
again as a Congressman, I was struck 
by how meaningful World War II was to 
the people of Russia. It was not uncom-
mon for brides and grooms to go to the 
monument of those who fought and 
died in World War II in the cities of 
Russia on the days of their weddings 
and have photographs taken in mem-
ory of the people who were lost in their 
families decades before. 
But Putin has now turned the tables, 
sadly, on this event with the just in-
credible, delusional comments that he 
makes. Here is Putin, reducing Ukrain-
ian towns to rubble if they refuse to 
surrender, forcibly deporting as many 
as 300,000 Ukrainians to Russia, trying 
to erase the Ukrainian identity from 
seized areas, and praising Russian mili-
tary units that are accused of blatant 
war crimes. 
A Washington Post editorial on Fri-
day hauntingly noted the historic par-
allel when they said: 
Of the mass deportations carried out by 
the Soviet regime during the early 1930s as 
part of the campaign by Joseph Stalin to 
subdue Ukraine through political repression 
. . . they used famine. 
Today, it is Vladimir Putin who is 
using terror, murder, and starvation 
against millions of innocent Ukrain-
ians. 
This war is monstrous. It is a threat 
not only to Ukraine but to the peace 
and stability of the entire world. If we 
are going to pay homage to the men 
and women who fought and to some 
who died—to the many who died—in 
World War II, we should remember that 
they did it to stop Hitler and to stop 
the Japanese in their efforts to conquer 
parts of the world. 
We thought in the 20th century, at 
the end of World War II, we had finally 
turned the page on that sort of con-
duct. Vladimir Putin is a reminder 
that those forces of evil are still in the 
world. 
Putin, reportedly, even wanted the 
Russian military to hold a victory pa-
rade in the devastated Ukrainian port 
city of Mariupol, but the parade plans 
had to be canceled because Ukrainian 
soldiers continue to fight against the 
Russian 
invaders. 
Ukrainians 
just 
won’t give up. And the city itself has 
been virtually bombed to dust—hardly 
the backdrop Putin wanted for his evil 
pretense of a celebration. 
Well, I have a message for Vladimir 
Putin on this Victory Day: You have 
disgraced yourself by selfishly exploit-
ing the memory of those Russians who 
protected your nation in World War II, 
and you do it to defend your own war 
crimes today. You will not erase 
Ukraine. You have only strengthened 
Ukrainian people and the collective 
will of the global community to defend 
them against Russian tyranny. 
There will be a Victory Day parade 
one day in Ukraine, and it will be to 
honor the valiant Ukrainians who sac-
rificed on the frontlines to defend free-
dom and democracy in Ukraine and 
worldwide. 
I am proud that the United States, 
through President Biden and a bipar-
tisan Congress, are standing behind the 
Ukrainian people at this moment when 
they are being tested. We are going 
into the third and fourth week of this 
Russian onslaught, and they still show 
remarkable achievement and resist-
ance. 
We are going to stand by them. We 
are going to defend them. We are going 
to let the world know the brutality 
that Vladimir Putin has visited on 
these brave people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2371 
May 9, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
ABORTION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
2 years ago, the Senate Democratic 
leader rallied a crowd on the steps of 
the Supreme Court and threatened Jus-
tices by name if they did not resolve an 
abortion case the way he wanted. Here 
was the quote: 
I want to tell you, Gorsuch; I want to tell 
you, Kavanaugh: You have released the 
whirlwind, and you will pay the price. You 
won’t know what hit you if you go forward 
with these awful decisions. 
This incitement triggered rare public 
rebukes from the Chief Justice himself 
and even the liberal American Bar As-
sociation. But, apparently, the radical 
left heard their marching orders loud 
and clear. 
Since the precedent-setting leak of a 
draft opinion last week, the left has set 
out to harass and intimidate sitting 
judges as they consider a pending case. 
We have seen angry crowds assemble at 
Justices’ private family homes. Activ-
ists publish a map of their addresses. 
Law enforcement has had to install a 
security fence around the Supreme 
Court itself. 
Trying—trying—to 
scare 
Federal 
judges into ruling a certain way is far 
outside the bounds of First Amend-
ment speech or protest; it is an at-
tempt to replace the rule of law with 
the rule of mobs. 
It appears this may possibly be 
flatout illegal. There is a Federal law 
on the books that criminalizes ‘‘pick-
ets or parades with the intent of influ-
encing any judge, juror, witness, or 
court officer’’ at locations—listen to 
this—that include a judge’s ‘‘resi-
dence.’’ 
Last year, Attorney General Gar-
land’s Justice Department was quick 
to treat the concerned parents of 
America like potential domestic ter-
rorists. But, curiously, I haven’t heard 
any announcement about how the DOJ 
may handle these intimidation tactics 
aimed directly at Federal judges. 
Washington Democrats have gone out 
of their way to fuel the hysterical, po-
tentially 
dangerous, 
climate. 
The 
President’s statement about the un-
precedented leak didn’t condemn it. 
His Press Secretary has repeatedly ap-
peared to endorse rallies at judge’s pri-
vate family residences as long as they 
don’t turn into outright violence. 
The senior Senator from Massachu-
setts stood on the Supreme Court steps 
and shouted: 
We are gonna fight back. 
Democrats are renewing their calls 
to break the Senate in order to pack 
the Court. They want to destroy two 
institutions for the price of one. 
One liberal Georgetown law professor 
helpfully summarized their mission as 
follows: He explained this past weekend 
that the key moral difference between 
this pressure campaign and the Janu-
ary 6 riot is that, in this case—now lis-
ten to this—‘‘the mob is right.’’ 
So what has generated this reckless 
outrage? What is the Armageddon over 
which Democrats want to break the 
Senate, pack the Court, and condone 
potentially 
illegal 
rallies 
outside 
judges’ family homes? Here is the case 
in question: whether the State of Mis-
sissippi can enact an abortion law that 
would still be more liberal—more lib-
eral—than laws in Germany, France, 
and Switzerland. 
This is the case that is driving these 
hysterics, the possibility that abortion 
laws might begin to move away from 
China and North Korea and closer to 
Germany, France, and Switzerland? 
That is what has prompted the calls to 
destroy our institutions and surround 
Justices’ family homes. That is why a 
pro-life nonprofit in Wisconsin got a 
Molotov cocktail through its window 
and activists called for disruptions of 
Sunday worship. 
Today’s Democratic Party is pro-
foundly out of step with the American 
people on this issue. Their extreme po-
sition ignores modern science and pub-
lic opinion. 
Leader SCHUMER wants the Senate to 
vote again on a Democratic bill that 
would effectively legalize abortion-on- 
demand through all 9 months. Their 
bill is written to protect abortionists 
rather than mothers. It would roll back 
health regulations. It would attack 
America’s conscience rights and reli-
gious freedoms. It would overturn mod-
est and overwhelmingly popular safe-
guards like waiting periods, informed 
consent laws, and possibly even paren-
tal notification. And it is written so 
that, in practice, it would allow elec-
tive abortion until birth. 
Democrats’ extreme position is rad-
ical on a global scale and wildly un-
popular with the American people. 
Only 34 percent of Americans believe 
abortion should be legal in all or most 
cases into the second trimester. That 
drops to 19 percent in the third tri-
mester, but that is what the Demo-
crats’ bill would allow in practice. 
Every Senate Democrat but two and 
every House Democrat except a handful 
has put their name on this as cospon-
sors. That means 97 percent of Wash-
ington Democrats support a position 
that only 19 percent of Americans actu-
ally want. I will say that again. Nine-
ty-seven percent of Democrats in Con-
gress are cosponsors of an outcome 
that has 19 percent public support. 
Notwithstanding inflation, energy in-
security, open borders, a violent crime-
wave, and a war in Europe, Democrats 
want to spend this week explaining 
their extremism. Some Democrats even 
want to try again to break the Senate 
in order to ram this through. I have 
clearly stated I will never, never sup-
port smashing the legislative filibuster 
on this issue or any other. Yet Demo-
crats want to wreck our institutions 
over their fringe position that Ameri-
cans do not share. 
I can understand why my colleagues 
want to distract from their governing 
record. Their policies have created a 
living nightmare for working families. 
But Democrats’ extreme and unpopular 
position on abortion is not going to 
bail them out. It just gives Americans 
yet another reminder that the radicals 
are running the show. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, I have just filed cloture on the 
Women’s Health Protection Act. This 
week, the Senate will be confronted 
with a simple but urgent question: Do 
women in this country have a basic 
right to make their own choices when 
it comes to seeking an abortion, yes or 
no? It will be one of the most impor-
tant questions this Chamber confronts 
in decades because, for the first time in 
50 years, women in America face the 
real possibility of living in a world 
where the protections of Roe v. Wade 
are a thing of the past. It will set up a 
situation where our children, female 
children, have less rights than their 
grandparents—something that is so un- 
American, taking away rights, step-
ping backward from rights in such a 
dramatic way. 
So, tonight, I will set up a vote for 
Wednesday on legislation that will cod-
ify the fundamental right to an abor-
tion into Federal law. Every American 
is going to see where every Senator 
stands on protecting one of the most 
important rights a woman has regard-
ing her own body. 
I want to be clear. This week’s vote 
is not an abstract exercise; this is as 
real and as high stakes as it gets. And 
Senate Republicans will no longer be 
able to hide from the horror they have 
unleashed upon women in America. 
After 
spending 
years 
packing 
our 
courts with rightwing judges and Jus-
tices, after changing the rules of the 
Senate to push three rigidly conserv-
ative Justices, after stealing the nomi-
nation of Merrick Garland, the time 
has come for Republicans, this new 
MAGA Republican Party, to answer for 
their actions. 
If Senate Republicans allow the Su-
preme Court’s decision to stand, it will 
be open season—open season—on wom-
en’s rights in America. 
A few days ago, Leader MCCONNELL 
himself acknowledged that a Federal 
ban on abortions is now possible should 
the Supreme Court overturn Roe and 
Republicans take control of the Sen-
ate. 
Let me say that again because it is 
so dreadful. In light of the Supreme 
Court’s decision—upcoming decision— 
Leader MCCONNELL acknowledged that 
a national ban on abortion is now pos-
sible without Roe if Republicans re-
claim the majority. 
Hear that, America? A total ban—a 
total national ban on abortion, stated 
by not any Republican but by the Re-
publican leader. Every single American 
needs to hear what Leader MCCONNELL 
said. 
For years—for decades—Republicans 
have tried to disguise their hostility to 
abortion by claiming that all they real-
ly want is to let the States decide for 
themselves how they will treat the 
issue. It is an old claim from the right: 
This is about States’ rights. This argu-
ment has always been hypocritical, and 
Leader MCCONNELL’s comments make 
it perfectly clear why. 
The game here is not about States’ 
rights; the goal has always been a na-
tional ban on abortions altogether. 
States’ rights is a smokescreen, noth-
ing more than a distraction, a ruse to 
hide from the true claims of the hard 
right, of the MAGA Republicans: a na-
tional ban on abortion. 
A Federal restriction on abortion 
would be among the most extreme 
ideas ever pushed by Senate Repub-
licans, but in light of Roe’s repeal, it 
seems that is the road the MAGA Re-
publicans want to take our country 
down. And as scary as that is, I feel it 
is just the start. Ideas that have long 
been relegated to the fringes will re-
turn to the forefront with a venge-
ance—forced pregnancies, bans that 
make zero exceptions for rape and in-
cest, even imprisonment for abortion 
providers and women who seek them— 
imprisonment for women who seek 
them, which is already happening with 
some State laws. 
Republicans are trying in vain to ob-
scure this reality. Last week, the chair 
of the Senate Republican campaign 
arm went as far as releasing an absurd 
collection of talking points trying to 
convince Americans that, no, Repub-
licans don’t want to throw doctors and 
women in jail for carrying out abor-
tions. 
The Republicans should know their 
position is truly extreme when that 
has to be one of their talking points. 
Oh, no, we don’t want to throw women 
in jail. But regardless of what Repub-
licans or the head of the Senate Repub-
lican campaign committee might try 
and claim, the laws being passed at the 
State level tell a different, much dark-
er story that totally contradicts what 
he says. 
In Arizona, for example, there is a 
law on the books that states that any-
one who performs an abortion could be 
sentenced to anywhere from 2 to 5 
years in prison. The new law in Arizona 
provides zero exceptions for rape and 
for incest. 
In Oklahoma, a new law just came 
into effect banning abortion as early as 
6 weeks and, like the law in Texas, em-
powers citizens to police each other’s 
conduct and sue women simply trying 
to access an abortion and, again, zero 
exceptions for rape, zero exceptions for 
incest. If, God forbid, a woman is raped 
and doesn’t want to have that child, 
the Republicans want to allow some of 
them to go to jail and some of them to 
be sued by their fellow citizens. Is that

a disgrace? Is that scary? Does that say 
we all must fight this tooth and nail? 
Now Republicans in Louisiana are 
even pushing a bill that could throw 
women and their healthcare providers 
in prison for life—for life. 
This is the America that Senate Re-
publicans 
have 
made 
possible—an 
America where women in many States 
could be forced to follow through on 
their pregnancies against their will; an 
America where abortions can be all but 
eliminated in more than half the 
States in the country; an America 
where many States provide zero excep-
tions for something as evil as rape or 
incest. These laws could put women 
and girls in serious danger. And none of 
this is theoretical anymore; it is writ-
ten into the veracity of the laws that 
have been passed by the hard right at 
the State level. And we know more are 
coming. 
All of this I bring to the feet of my 
Senate colleagues as we prepare to vote 
later this week. No more running. No 
more hiding. No more diversions. Lead-
er MCCONNELL can’t talk about the ac-
tual effects of the law except when he 
made that one statement. Always di-
versions. Always about ‘‘Oh, look what 
they are doing’’ because they don’t 
want the American people to know how 
hard right, how fiercely anti-women, 
how vicious some of their laws are. 
I ask my colleagues to think care-
fully about their choice later this 
week. No more running. No more hid-
ing. The vote will shine light on every 
single one of us. It will be like a flood-
light, and we will each have to make 
our positions clear. 
Again, I ask my colleagues to think 
carefully about their choice later this 
week because the consequences of this 
vote will stay with us for the rest of 
our time in office. The Nation will be 
watching. The rights of millions of 
American women are at stake, and 
they will be watching. And there will 
be no hiding from where each of us 
stands on this most precious, most pri-
vate, 
most 
personal 
decision 
that 
women ever have had to make when it 
comes to their own lives. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
INTERNET 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, it has been a wonderful weekend 
in Tennessee. We had the annual West 
Tennessee Strawberry Festival out in 
Humboldt, TN. Quite honestly, I think 
the strawberries were better and sweet-
er this year than ever before. There 
was wonderful strawberry shortcake 
and deserts. It was a wonderful week-
end. It provided such a great oppor-
tunity to talk with parents and to hear 
from Tennesseans, from moms and dads 
about things that were of concern to 
them. 
I had a mom make a comment to me 
that I think each of us should listen to 
and take to heart. I know the Presiding 
Officer knows how hard a parent’s job 
is because she is a mom. 
I look at my children and my grand-
children, and I thought about this 
lady’s comment. She said, you know, 
when she was growing up, she felt like 
that when she came home, that was the 
safe harbor; that is where she knew she 
was going to be safe. But today, she 
said she feels like many times, the 
enemy is within those four walls be-
cause of what children are exposed to 
online. 
Like many parents, she began to pay 
more attention during COVID, and 
what she has found out has just as-
tounded her. Like many parents, she 
feels the hardest part of her job is 
keeping her children safe and providing 
them with the environment that helps 
them grow into the very best person 
they could possibly be. 
I really related to that. My husband 
often would say: We need to teach our 
children how to love and how to laugh 
and how to work and how to pray. That 
is something that we have done. We 
have raised our children so that they 
would love one another and their fellow 
man and love this country and appre-
ciate the opportunities that we are 
given. We have raised them to believe 
in their faith and to exercise that faith 
every single day. We have also taught 
them and reared them to believe in a 
very 
purposeful 
life—always 
giving 
more than you take and leaving things 
in better shape than you found them. 
Now, as Chuck and I reared our fam-
ily, what we didn’t want to do was 
hand down a bunch of mandates to the 
kids and not give them explanations. 
What we tried to do was to teach them 
and give them the knowledge that they 
would be able to function without us 
and would develop that discernment 
and make those wise decisions. I know 
that that is something that most par-
ents do: teach those children so that 
they can make wise decisions on their 
own and leave the door open so when 
they feel threatened or vulnerable, 
they know they can come to you and 
talk about it. 
On this point, Big Tech and the rad-
ical left have one thing in common. 
Their interests are best served if par-
ents are not spending time parenting, 
because what Big Tech and many of the 
radicals are doing is using social media 
platforms to take children who are vul-
nerable and then push them into ac-
tions on social media platforms. It is, 
indeed, a toxic environment for our 
children on these platforms. That on-
line element is at the top of a long list 
of things that have parents really wor-
ried about what is going on in this 
country. Summer is coming on, and 
parents are paying attention to this. 
They are looking at other concerns. 
Inflation 
has 
absolutely 
decimated 
their savings accounts. When I talk to 
Tennesseans, sometimes they will talk 
about how much money they could 
save during the Trump years, and they 
are glad they did because inflation is 
now eating away at those savings that 
they had banked. Crime in the streets 
and drugs in our communities have 
turned the nightly news into a horror 
show. People cannot believe the way 
crime has grown. Much of it is driven 
by that open southern border. 
Parents are telling me that they are 
a little bit unsettled that they can’t 
trust what their kids are learning in 
school in that those lessons are going 
to be in line with history, with civics, 
with reality, and this bothers them. It 
is why we are seeing school board races 
as the hot races of this year. It is why 
we have—whether it is Virginia Beach 
or San Francisco—people being tossed 
off of school boards. It is because what 
they were teaching was not in line with 
our Nation’s history. 
But, when it comes to the influence 
of tech, that is where parents feel like 
they are surrounded. As I said, there is 
a mom who said she once thought, in-
side those four walls, there was safety; 
but now she feels that it is not because 
of what they are seeing. 
It is difficult for parents to under-
stand how all this screen time is affect-
ing their children because Big Tech 
keeps changing the rules to fit their 
business strategies. Mind you, that 
business strategy is, How many eye-
balls can they capture, and how long 
can they hold them? because that 
means they make more money on the 
ads that they sell. Indeed, Instagram 
admits they are an ad company. They 
are an ad company. They make money 
by getting you to watch them. The 
longer you watch or the more deeply 
you run through a thread, they are 
making more money. 
I would remind my colleagues that 
many of today’s parents grew up along-
side the tech companies, and now they 
are watching these tech companies 
have a stranglehold on their children’s 
lives. They are the Facebook early 
adopters, many of today’s parents of 
young children. This means that they 
learned a long time ago that online 
interactions bring out the worst in peo-
ple. They know that ‘‘once it is on the 
internet, it is there forever’’ is true, 
and they probably wish their digital 
footprints were a little bit smaller now 
that they have children and are look-
ing at it as parents. 
The point is these parents are not 
anti-tech; they are pro-tech, but now 
their kids are falling into the same 
traps that they did. They are over-
whelmed because Big Tech is actively 
sabotaging their attempts to pull their 
children to safety and away from so 
much screen time. They know that the 
people who run these social media com-
panies have zero desire or incentive to 
control the flow of toxic content into 
the timeline of underaged users. It is 
just too lucrative an operation for 
them to give up. As I said, they need 
those eyeballs; they need them glued to 
the screen. 
Now, when I and other members of 
the 
Consumer 
Protection 
Sub-
committee presented executives from 
Instagram with evidence that they 
were actively enabling predatory con-
tent, they claimed our evidence was

anecdotal. Parents know this was a 
falsehood, and so do we. By its very na-
ture, Snapchat is a predator’s dream; 
TikTok is a hot bed of foreign propa-
ganda; Twitter is a free-for-all, and 
they are going to stay that way as long 
as 
their 
executives 
keep 
making 
money. They are following the dollar. 
Of the service they provide, they con-
tinue to say: Well, it is free. The serv-
ice is free. 
The sad thing is, it is our children 
who are the product. Our children and 
their usage online—that is the product 
that these tech companies are using to 
make money and pad their pockets. All 
you have to do is look around at the 
state of discourse in this country to 
know what this kind of exposure will 
eventually do to an impressionable 
child, especially after isolation from 
school lockdowns during COVID. 
This isn’t a question of bridging a 
generational divide. Parents under-
stand that they need to be involved in 
their kids’ lives. They want to be in-
volved in their children’s lives. It is sad 
and hurtful and devastating when they 
are not involved. They accept that 
times change and that they will have 
to do their research if they want to 
keep up and make certain that they 
are keeping their children safe, but 
they will never accept Silicon Valley’s 
argument 
that 
they 
aren’t 
smart 
enough to understand what is going on. 
Unfortunately for Silicon Valley, the 
Senate has done the impossible and ral-
lied behind bipartisan legislation to 
give parents and kids more control 
over their online experiences, and you 
are right—Big Tech is fighting back. 
Back 
in 
February, 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and I introduced the Kids 
Online Safety Act. Here is what it 
would do: 
First, it would force platforms to 
give minors the ability to protect their 
information; disable addictive product 
features; and opt out of algorithmic 
recommendations. 
Next, it would give parents the abil-
ity to help control their kids’ online 
experience as well as a dedicated chan-
nel to report predatory behavior. Pred-
atory content and content that pro-
motes self-harm, suicide, and eating 
disorders to minors will now, indeed, be 
a problem for these platforms to deal 
with—no more denial or deflection. 
We also included requirements for 
annual risk assessments and access to 
datasets we can use to assess safety 
threats to underaged users. 
It should be obvious by now that 
American parents have had enough of 
powerful people trying to control their 
children. They have said no time and 
again to the Biden administration’s 
radical socialist agenda. They have 
said no to the racial politics the unions 
want to inject into public school cur-
riculums, and now they are saying no 
to Silicon Valley. 
I think it is our duty to give them 
the help that they are looking for. I 
urge my colleagues to join Senator 
BLUMENTHAL and me and support the 
Kids Online Safety Act and to do this 
in support of parents. They are not 
going to let this issue go. When I talk 
to moms, this is one of the things they 
talk about the most: as I said, infla-
tion, the border, crime in the streets, 
drugs on the streets, and Big Tech and 
the harm it is bringing to our children. 
They are going to stay on this issue be-
cause they know their children’s lives 
and safety depend on it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ABORTION 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, Re-
publicans 
continue 
to 
be 
totally 
shocked by the leak of a draft Supreme 
Court decision. But what is truly 
shocking is the fact that we have a rad-
ical, rightwing majority now on our 
Supreme Court, thanks to three Trump 
Justices who are poised to take away a 
constitutional right that women in 
this country have relied upon for al-
most 50 years. 
The Supreme Court has never over-
turned a constitutional right it has 
earlier conferred. And yet today, in 
2022, women across the country are 
going to wake up and no longer have 
control over their own bodies once the 
Supreme Court stays its course to 
overturn both Roe and Casey. The Re-
publican Party has sabotaged the Su-
preme Court, and women and girls 
across the country are going to pay the 
price. 
In 13 States, the minute Roe is over-
turned, abortion will be illegal, and 
dozens of other States will move to do 
the same. These States are prepared to 
outlaw abortion with only narrow ex-
ceptions, if at all. 
Imagine this. If a child is raped, Re-
publicans will force her to give birth. If 
a woman’s life is in danger, Repub-
licans will force her to give birth, de-
spite the fact that the United States 
already has the highest maternal mor-
tality rate of any developed country. If 
a woman cannot afford to raise a child, 
Republicans will force her to give birth 
anyway. And then, once that child is 
born, all of a sudden, their concern for 
that child pretty much goes out the 
window. 
They have done little to support 
women and families. They have repeat-
edly blocked Democratic efforts to pro-
vide healthcare, childcare, paid family 
leave, and more. There is nothing pro- 
life about that. And if a woman chooses 
to get an abortion for any reason, 
whether it be rape or medical neces-
sity, Republicans stand ready to throw 
in jail women, doctors, and even those 
who help people access the procedure. 
And make no mistake, if Republicans 
take control over the House and Sen-
ate, they will press to pass national 
legislation that will outlaw abortion 
throughout the country. 
I have been an advocate for reproduc-
tive freedom for decades. When I was in 
college, abortion was not legal. It was 
the first time I wrote a political letter 
to the members of Hawaii’s congres-
sional delegation asking for their posi-
tion on abortion. Abortion is one of the 
reasons I became an activist. And I 
fought against concerted efforts to 
limit abortion in Hawaii during the 14 
years that I served in the Hawaii State 
Legislature. I knew then, as I do now, 
that women should be able to control 
our own bodies. 
And, sadly, the threat to women’s 
freedom is as real today as it was when 
I was first advocating for this right 
decades ago. 
I am proud that Hawaii was the first 
State in the country to decriminalize 
abortion before Roe. So regardless of 
the Supreme Court decision, women’s 
reproductive freedom in Hawaii will be 
protected. But for how long? So many 
women across the country do not live 
in States like Hawaii that protect the 
right to an abortion. 
Barriers to abortion access have al-
ways 
existed—barriers 
like 
finding 
childcare, taking time off from work 
and travel and transportation and 
more. The number of women dealing 
with the obstacles to get the essential 
healthcare they need will skyrocket if 
Roe is overturned. 
And we know who is going to be 
harmed the most: people who can’t 
travel, including people with low in-
comes, people with disabilities. 
Due to systemic barriers and this 
country’s legacy of racism and dis-
crimination, Black, Latino, indigenous, 
Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, 
and other people of color disproportion-
ately feel the effects of abortion bans 
and restrictions. 
We know this is true because we have 
seen it play out in Texas. Already, 
women in Texas have to travel hun-
dreds of miles to seek abortion serv-
ices. Many women in Texas do not have 
the means or the opportunity. 
When you read Justice Alito’s draft 
opinion, it is quite clear that this Jus-
tice has harbored a desire to overturn 
Roe for the 16 years he has been on the 
Supreme Court. And, now, thanks to 
the three Trump Justices, his radical 
opinion on abortion is no longer dis-
sent but the majority opinion. This is 
our worst fears coming true. 
Meanwhile, 
I 
listened 
to 
MITCH 
MCCONNELL, the Republican leader, 
this morning, who kept calling Demo-
crats ‘‘extreme’’ in our view—in our 
commitment to supporting a woman’s 
right to abortion. He said that he 
would never support ‘‘smashing’’ the 
filibuster on this or any issue. Well, he 
had no problem smashing the filibuster 
when it came to Supreme Court Jus-
tices, and that is the very reason that 
three radical Trump Justices got on 
the Supreme Court in the first place 
and the reason why women are about

to lose a constitutional right that we 
have relied upon for almost 50 years. 
Make no mistake, these radical Jus-
tices are just getting started. Alito’s 
draft opinion, which denigrates any 
privacy basis for Roe, casts doubt on 
other privacy rights. Without privacy 
rights, the States are basically unfet-
tered in what they do. 
And now that the radical rightwing 
Justices are on the cusp of getting 
what they wish regarding abortion 
rights, Justice Alito is already sig-
naling 
what 
is 
next: 
revisiting 
Obergefell, the marriage equality deci-
sion. And we know so much more is at 
stake. 
We cannot sit back and accept this as 
our new normal. We cannot go back to 
a time when women had no autonomy 
over our own bodies. We cannot go 
back to a time when members of the 
LGBTQ+ community were treated as 
second-class citizens. And we cannot go 
back to a time where basic human 
rights were left up to the States—to 
the States—to decide. 
Since when do States get to decide 
whether or not a constitutional right 
exists? That is what we have the Su-
preme Court for, and that is what the 
Supreme Court is not making sure that 
we continue to protect. 
So here we are. Not only do we have 
to push to codify Roe nationally, but 
we have to take this fight to the bal-
lots in November. As Justice Alito, in 
his draft opinion, cavalierly said, basi-
cally: All you women out there, go out 
and vote. So, yes, he is calling on the 
women of this country to use our en-
ergy and our resources to fight for a 
right, a constitutional right, that 
women in this country relied on for 
nearly 50 years. And, yes, that is ex-
actly what we are going to do. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF ANN CLAIRE PHILLIPS 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge my colleagues to 
support the nomination of RADM Ann 
Phillips to be Administrator of the 
Maritime Administration. 
Rear Admiral Phillips served in the 
U.S. Navy for 31 years, served in Oper-
ations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 
and held leadership positions such as 
the Director of Surface Warfare for the 
Chief of Naval Operations. Most re-
cently, she served as special assistant 
to former Governor of Virginia Ralph 
Northam, where she focused on coastal 
adaptation and protection. 
This nomination is so important to 
our maritime industry, especially as 
we are facing unprecedented challenges 
in the maritime supply chain. The Mar-
itime Administration is responsible for 
supporting America’s maritime trans-
portation 
industry, 
including 
sup-
porting the health of the U.S. mer-
chant marine fleet, investing in port 
infrastructure, 
supporting 
American 
shipyards, and growing and training 
the maritime workforce. 
Never before have maritime and ship-
ping issues been more important to the 
health of our economy and consumers. 
Our ports are handling record amounts 
of cargo as COVID–19 has caused con-
sumers to shift their spending habits to 
e-commerce. The arrival of these im-
ports has led to record volumes at our 
U.S. ports. 
In 2021, the Ports of Los Angeles and 
Long Beach moved 10 million con-
tainers for the first time ever. In my 
State, the State of Washington, the 
Northwest Seaport Alliance saw a 15- 
percent increase in container volumes 
over the last year. So this unprece-
dented volume continues to cause mas-
sive challenges of ships backed up off-
shore and vessels anchoring or loi-
tering in waiting areas near the Ports 
of L.A. and Long Beach. Twenty-two 
percent of sales have been lost by agri-
cultural exports due to transportation 
delays and cancelations, with products 
like potatoes, milk, wheat, and seafood 
that are literally rotting on our port 
docks. 
My colleagues and I have been work-
ing hard to pass the Ocean Shipping 
Reform Act. And we did that out of the 
Senate, and now, obviously, our col-
leagues in the House—we have different 
bills—hopefully, will either resolve this 
in USICA or, with the passage of one of 
these bills, with the Senate bill maybe 
being passed by the House. 
But the Federal Maritime Commis-
sion needs tools to crack down on bad 
actors in the shipping industry and re-
duce costs facing consumers. Our bill 
that passed in March that, as I said, we 
are working to reconcile, we believe 
needs to become law as soon as pos-
sible. 
But the bill is only a piece of the sup-
ply chain challenge. We need to make 
serious investments in our port infra-
structure to handle the increasing ca-
pacity and get goods moving, and 
MARAD is charged with overseeing the 
Port Infrastructure Development Pro-
gram, the primary grant program used 
to invest in our ports and help move 
our products. That is why it is so im-
portant to have this position. 
President Biden’s bipartisan infra-
structure law included 2.25 billion 
MARAD port infrastructure develop-
ment dollars for the next 5 years. I 
want to thank my colleague Senator 
WICKER for working with us on this— 
this is such critical infrastructure in-
vestment—and all my colleagues who 
supported those programs. This huge 
economic opportunity and the volume 
of our trade needs the infrastructure at 
our ports to continue to increase. 
We need Rear Admiral Phillips con-
firmed to make sure those dollars get 
out the door and get them to our ports 
now. We need the leadership of this or-
ganization to improve the resiliency of 
our ports, which are vulnerable to cli-
mate change and extreme storms. And 
we need Rear Admiral Phillips’ experi-
ence in coastal resiliency as we have 
charged MARAD with building a mari-
time industry for the future that 
makes sure that we are looking at 
shore power issues and operating on 
cleaner fuels. 
And we need Rear Admiral Phillips’ 
experience in the Navy that will bring 
the expertise to the workforce mission. 
MARAD is tasked with ensuring that 
the United States has a strong mer-
chant marine workforce to support the 
U.S. Sealift Program. The events in 
Ukraine have shown us that we must 
deal with the shortage of merchant 
mariners. It is estimated that we are 
over 1,800 merchant marine officers 
short of the need in case of a conflict. 
With the rise of China and the ongoing 
conflict in Ukraine, we cannot take an-
other minute for granted for the need 
for U.S.-flagged ships and U.S. mari-
ners to support the logistics of the U.S. 
military. I know the Presiding Officer 
knows this very well. 
In addition to strengthening our 
workforce, we need to invest in our 
shipyards, maintain our national de-
fense needs as well as strengthen the 
U.S. flag fleet. This means investing in 
modern shipyards and identifying in-
centives to build new generations of 
U.S.-flagged ships. 
These U.S. merchant mariners are 
also vital to the maritime industry. My 
State and various States face a work-
force shortage and many of our other 
maritime sectors also. We need to skill 
and train a workforce for tomorrow. 
Maritime jobs are good, family wage 
jobs, but we need to have a talented 
workforce that is inclusive, and we 
need to have an inclusive environment 
and work with the Coast Guard and the 
maritime industry to address issues of 
sexual assault and harassment to keep 
people safe in the workplace at sea. 
Rear Admiral Phillips is the right 
person for this job to help the industry, 
the maritime unions, the shipping com-
panies, and the Coast Guard to foster 
change. She has been a trailblazer in 
her career because she has been the 
first woman to command a destroyer 
squadron, the first woman Director of 
Surface Warfare, and now the first 
woman Maritime Administrator. 
I urge my colleagues to support her 
nomination.

UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk again 
about the illegal, totally unjustified, 
unprovoked, and brutal attack on 
Ukraine by Russian forces. 
This is the 11th week in a row I have 
come to the Chamber to talk about 
this because I think it is really impor-
tant that the American people know 
what is going on over there and that we 
rally to the defense of our allies in 
Ukraine. 
This week is the 77th anniversary of 
what is called V-E Day. That is the day 
the war in Europe ended—World War 
II—when the United States finally led 
the allies to defeat the tyranny of Nazi 
Germany and liberated millions of peo-
ple. Then, in the Cold War, we led the 
world again to defeat the encroach-
ment of Soviet communism on Eastern 
Europe. Again, millions of people were 
liberated, including Ukrainians. 
We cannot forget this because, as we 
look at Ukraine, what do we see? The 
same thing—people who yearn to be 
free. That is all they want is to live in 
freedom in their own sovereign, inde-
pendent 
country. 
Once 
again, 
the 
United States and our allies in Europe 
are standing with these Europeans in 
fighting to hold onto their freedom in 
the face of this illegal, unprovoked, 
and brutal attack. 
When Vladimir Putin spoke at cere-
monies in Russia this week to com-
memorate the same V-E Day, he used 
it to justify Russia’s invasion, saying: 
The danger was growing day by day, [so] 
Russia [gave] a preemptive response to an 
aggression. 
Of course, nothing could be further 
from the truth. The Ukrainians were 
never the aggressors. The Ukrainians 
just want to live in peace with their 
neighbors, including with Russia. 
Here is a map of Ukraine today, and 
this is what has been going on. 
In the dark red, what you see here is 
what the Russians took in 2014—the 
year that Ukraine decided definitively 
they wanted to turn to the West to be 
a free, democratic country. Russia re-
sponded with this: taking over Crimea 
and taking over the Luhansk and 
Donetsk parts of the Donbas. 
The light red is what they have 
taken in this latest invasion, and what 
they intend to take, according to their 
military generals who have spoken, is a 
much bigger area here. 
The blue, of course, is where the 
Ukrainians have pushed back, where 
they have gone on the counteroffen-
sive. They have actually pushed the 
Russians out around Kyiv, around the 
northern part of the country and other 
parts and, right now, as you can see, in 
various parts of the Donbas region, in-
cluding around this town of Kharkiv. 
Now, Kharkiv is an interesting situa-
tion. It is actually a sister city to Cin-
cinnati, OH, my hometown, and I was 
on the Sister City Committee decades 
ago when we developed that relation-
ship. They have a beautiful river run-
ning through the city. It was and will 
be, in the future, a beautiful city; but 
now, as these Ukrainians are in the 
fight of their lives just to keep their 
democracy, you see what is happening 
in Kharkiv. 
The Ukrainians are beginning to 
make progress both to the north of 
Kharkiv and here to the south and to 
the east. It is possible that the Ukrain-
ians could actually push the Russians 
back far enough so that the city itself 
would be out of artillery range of the 
Russians. That would be great because, 
right now, the people of Kharkiv, like 
so many other people in places like 
Mariupol, of course, are being attacked 
by the Russians with artillery every 
night, every day. So, if they could get 
the Russian forces pushed back beyond 
that period, they could get relief serv-
ices in to the civilians—food, water— 
that were previously denied by the 
Russians. 
I think it might also force the Rus-
sians to make a decision. They would 
have to decide between addressing 
Ukraine’s 
counteroffensive 
near 
Kharkiv—that is here—and expanding 
their forces over here, which they have 
said they want to do. I think if they do 
that—expand their forces—they are 
going to be risking their communica-
tions and supply lines here being cut 
off by the Ukrainians. 
So we will see what happens, but this 
is a crucial time in the battle. We are 
at a turning point. I guess that is real-
ly my point. 
We are being asked to look at legisla-
tion that has been sent to us by the ad-
ministration—called the Ukraine Sup-
plemental Funding bill—at a time 
when there is a crucial battle going on 
and when there could be a turning 
point in this broader war. 
Last week, I spoke with the Ukrain-
ian Ambassador to the United States, 
Oksana Markarova. I will be speaking 
to her again tomorrow morning. She 
made the point that the Presidential 
drawdown authority—that is the fund-
ing they are currently using from the 
United States—is just about depleted. 
It was about $3.3 billion in military aid 
that the President had, with the au-
thority given to him by Congress, to 
draw down some of our resources to be 
able to provide to Ukraine. As of last 
week, she told me that $3.3 billion is 
just about depleted; therefore, a new 
authority is critically needed right 
now. 
You don’t want to have a gap—par-
ticularly with regard to munitions—in 
being able to ensure that they have the 
more effective weaponry—the heavy 
weaponry—that they are now using in 
places like this and here and here and 
can continue to have the ammunition 
that is needed to be able to continue 
the fight. 
I also spoke late last week to Bridget 
Brink. She is the current Ambassador 
to Slovakia and is a seasoned Foreign 
Service professional whom the Biden 
administration has now nominated to 
be 
the 
U.S. 
Ambassador 
here 
in 
Ukraine. We haven’t had an Ambas-
sador there for well over a year, maybe

2 years. I have been asking the Biden 
administration—pushing the Biden ad-
ministration—to send an Ambassador 
to Ukraine for over a year. I did the 
same with the Trump administration 
when we didn’t have an Ambassador 
there for a while and even with the 
Obama administration to try to ensure 
we had a representative. 
Why? It is so important to have an 
Ambassador there. You need somebody 
at the highest level to be able to have 
the Ukrainian officials have someone 
they can work with directly who can 
answer questions, make commitments, 
be someone who is authorized by the 
President. It is also helpful to have 
that information on the ground being 
relayed straight back to our teams 
here in Washington. 
At least 17 other countries, by the 
way, have returned their diplomatic 
personnel to the capital, Kyiv. We have 
not. We are, apparently, going to do 
that soon. I hope so. I hope so. I know 
that the Ambassador nominee would 
like to go back to Kyiv. I know that a 
lot of members of the team would be-
cause I have met with them in Poland. 
They are over here in Poland now, for 
the most part, and are going into Lviv 
sometimes; but we need to get back to 
Kyiv. 
In terms of what is going on in the 
battlefield, let’s talk a little more 
about that and of the importance of 
the weapons and the materiel support 
that we have already provided and, 
therefore, what we must continue to 
provide. 
Since February 24, when this latest 
Russian invasion began, we have now 
provided $13.6 billion in military, eco-
nomic, 
and 
humanitarian 
aid 
for 
Ukraine. This latest request for fund-
ing from the White House is for $33 bil-
lion, so it is for even more. There were 
reports that this latest supplemental 
would be tied to other things, particu-
larly to the COVID funding that the 
administration is also eager to get 
passed. I was strongly against that be-
cause, when you tie it up with other 
things, it inevitably slows it down, and 
this is absolutely urgent. 
I was really pleased to see that about 
an hour and a half ago, President Biden 
issued a statement saying he now sup-
ports separating the Ukraine funding 
from the COVID funding. I commend 
him for that. It is good news. Again, we 
have seen so many times around here 
when you combine things, it slows ev-
erything down, and it creates a polit-
ical football that goes back and forth. 
This is desperately needed assistance 
that is going to determine whether 
some Ukrainian civilians and some of 
their military forces live or die, be-
cause this aid is so critical to their 
success. 
After Vladimir Putin’s claim of suc-
cess during this week’s V-E ceremony— 
as we talked about—in Moscow, it is 
very likely, in my view, that he is now 
going to feel the need to call up an 
even fuller mobilization of his military 
and engage in even more brutality—if 
that is possible—against the innocent 
civilians in Ukraine. So it is all the 
more reason for us to pass this latest 
spending request now and get this mili-
tary equipment to the Ukrainians who 
need it so desperately. 
Some Americans may wonder if we 
can make a difference in protecting 
freedom in Ukraine without directly 
engaging the American military or en-
gaging with Russia. I would say we can, 
and I would say we have made a dif-
ference. The U.S. and our NATO allies 
and other allies around the world have 
already made a positive contribution 
to Ukraine’s success in pushing back 
against the Russians—a much larger 
army with more weapons of every kind. 
Prior to the latest invasion on Feb-
ruary 24, the United States and some 
allies shipped these Javelin anti-tank 
weapons, Stinger anti-air missiles, and 
other small arms and munitions to 
Ukraine to be able to counter what we 
thought was going to happen and did, 
which was Russian battalion tactical 
groups coming into the country. It was 
effective. It was effective in Kyiv, and 
it was effective in other areas of 
Ukraine to be able to push back as you 
can see. These Russian units were es-
sentially light-mechanized formations 
which contained armored anti-infantry 
vehicles and medium to heavy tanks, 
along with infantry and light artillery. 
The first 2 months of the war have 
proven that the Russians were not very 
effective with their coordination of 
these groups, and because of their tac-
tical incompetence, they were largely 
defeated up here by a more proficient 
and a more effective Ukrainian mili-
tary. 
The mobility at the tactical level 
among the Ukrainian Armed Forces is 
at the core of the NATO doctrine in 
something called ‘‘combined arms war-
fare’’—essentially the coordinated em-
ployment of the tanks, artillery, and 
infantry to defend or seize territory. 
Since 2014, when Ukraine turned away 
from tyranny and toward the West and 
Russia 
immediately 
invaded, 
the 
threat of a larger scale invasion was 
clear, so Ukraine’s forces began to 
train and learn alongside U.S. troops 
and other NATO allies. Again, we 
worked with them to transition from a 
Soviet-style military to one that em-
phasized the initiative of noncommis-
sioned officers and mission-style orders 
and better coordination between these 
groups. 
Thanks to an extensive effort by our 
military and that of our NATO allies, 
the Ukrainians were able to build a 
military that was more proficient and 
technically agile. It was able not only 
to withstand the initial Russian on-
slaught but to defeat Russian forces, 
including around Kyiv. In the past 
month, the Ukrainian Armed Forces 
have repositioned to the east, taking 
with them that same tactic, that same 
coordination, and have provided tac-
tical reconnaissance through drones 
and have used highly accurate artil-
lery. In doing so, they have thwarted 
Russian attempts to gain more ground 
here in the East. 
Of course, nothing substitutes for the 
bravery and grit of the Ukrainian peo-
ple and particularly of the Ukrainian 
soldiers—professional and civilian sol-
diers alike. They are defending their 
homeland fiercely, and that is the sin-
gle most important element to their 
success. But we also owe a debt of grat-
itude 
to 
our 
troops 
who 
trained 
Ukrainians, many of whom are Na-
tional Guardsmen, perhaps from your 
State, and also our British, Canadian, 
and other NATO partners who helped 
the Ukrainian military become the ef-
fective battlefield force we see today. 
I say this because we need to know 
that the help that we are giving does 
make a difference, not just in terms of 
the weapons but also the training. 
The training of Armed Forces and 
equipping them was done through what 
is called the Ukraine Security Assist-
ance Initiative, USAI. It was created 
back in 2016. I actually modified a 
McCain amendment to create this new 
initiative. Since 2016, it has provided 
$1.6 billion for training, equipment, ad-
visory efforts, command and control 
functions, cyber defense, and strategic 
communications. Most importantly, it 
helped teach Ukraine mobility on the 
battlefield—again, a model of warfare 
that was superior to what Russia had. 
That first phase of our support in-
cluded the Javelins and the Stingers 
we talked about, then a heavy focus on 
organizing the transfer of existing 
stocks of Soviet-era weaponry in East-
ern Europe—places like Poland or Slo-
vakia—to Ukraine. But these Soviet- 
era weapons and munitions were al-
ways finite, and the war has exhausted 
a lot of those supplies coming from 
these other countries in the region. So 
this 
Ukraine 
supplemental 
request 
from the White House is understand-
ably a larger amount because Ukraine 
now requires heavier weaponry and 
ones that are NATO standard. So more 
funds are needed to be able to trans-
port these larger weapons at greater 
distances and to train Ukrainian forces 
on these weapons and to continue to 
replenish them with ammunition. So it 
is more of a traditional battlefield 
down here requiring that heavier weap-
on, more expensive weaponry, and now, 
again, NATO-standard weaponry. 
While the United States and our al-
lies are providing significant resources 
to this cause, the costs imposed on 
Russia are much greater. What do I 
mean by that? 
Russia has now committed more than 
70 percent of its total combat power to 
Ukraine, and much of that has been de-
graded and continues to be degraded. 
This raises an interesting point: Let’s 
remember that Russia directly threat-
ened military intervention against a 
number of our NATO allies, including 
the Baltics, Latvia, Lithuania, Esto-
nia, including Poland, even the UK, 
and, more recently, two countries that 
are not NATO but are our allies, Fin-
land and Sweden.

Other allies that they have threat-
ened, we are legally obligated to pro-
tect if they are in NATO, under NATO 
article 5. So downgrading Russia’s 
Army 
in 
Ukraine 
and 
supporting 
Ukraine’s Armed Forces is a pretty ef-
fective way to ensure that Russia does 
not have the ability to attack NATO 
and instantly begin a direct U.S.-Rus-
sian confrontation—something we have 
wanted to avoid. 
And speaking of NATO, it is encour-
aging, again, that Sweden and Finland 
are refusing to be intimidated by these 
Russian threats and are looking to join 
the alliance instead. At the end of last 
week, Finland already conducted mili-
tary exercises with NATO military 
units from the United States, the UK, 
Estonia, and Latvia. I am proud that 
we are supporting this effort mili-
tarily. And Finland is now upgrading 
its air force. That is good. The Senate 
should 
immediately 
confirm 
NATO 
membership of both of these nations as 
soon as it comes before us. 
It is important to note that it is not 
just the U.S. Government and our al-
lied governments that are supporting 
Ukraine in its hour of need. Since this 
terrible conflict began, everyday Amer-
icans across the country have stepped 
up to provide much needed assistance 
to Ukrainian defenders, refugees, and 
first responders. 
In March, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, 
sent out a request for surplus or ex-
pired personal protective gear to pro-
vide to Ukrainian territorial defense 
forces. They said they needed more 
protective gear, and we responded. I am 
proud to say that Ohio answered that 
call. All together, more than two dozen 
law enforcement agencies across my 
home State have donated almost 2,000 
pieces of personal protective gear, 71 
vest carriers, 45 helmets, and over 1,800 
pieces of body armor. With the help of 
the Fund to Aid Ukraine—a nonprofit 
based in Parma, OH—this badly needed 
equipment will soon make its way into 
the hands of brave Ukrainian defenders 
who are fighting for their lives as they 
endure Russia’s brutal assault. 
This organization has also given 24 
pallets of supplies, over 7 tons of med-
ical supplies to Ukraine. I am grateful 
for everyone who stepped forward, es-
pecially to those law enforcement 
agencies that have stepped forward to 
help those Ukrainian law enforcement 
entities and first responders and terri-
torial defense troops who need better 
protection. And this is happening all 
over America. 
Additionally, there is a group in 
Cleveland called MedWish. They are 
amazing. I got to go visit them last 
month. They are a very effective non-
profit that has worked for years to pro-
vide medical supplies, hospital supplies 
to countries that have suffered, say, 
from a natural disaster but also in the 
case of Ukraine, of course, from the 
war. They have partnered with a group 
called the United Ukrainian Organiza-
tions of Ohio, headed by my friend 
Marta Liscynesky, to provide indi-
vidual first aid kits and other medical 
equipment to Ukrainian first respond-
ers, 
defenders, 
and 
civilians. 
And 
Cleveland-based KOACORE is deliv-
ering 17,000 individual first aid kits to 
the frontlines. This is a company in 
Cleveland that is a safety management 
company so it is a good role for them. 
They are doing it, again, as volunteers 
and donating this. 
When I was on the Polish-Ukrainian 
border in March, I saw Marta and an-
other Ohio friend Andy Futey, who is 
president of the Ukrainian World Con-
gress, in action, organizing some of 
this equipment that was coming into 
Ukraine and particularly helping our 
refugees coming from Ukraine. 
One of my own staffers, Josh Prest, 
recently volunteered to transport some 
of 
this 
assistance 
to 
Europe. 
He 
checked an extra bag on his flight so he 
could carry more individual first aid 
kits, and he delivered them as well. 
Again, there are thousands and thou-
sands of Americans doing these sorts of 
things. 
As Russian forces intentionally tar-
get Ukrainian civilians to spread fear 
and panic, this display of generosity 
from the people of Ohio will reassure 
Ukrainians that America has their 
back. With this donation, Ukrainian 
first responders running into the rub-
ble of schools, apartment buildings, 
and homes will be able to save more 
lives. I am very proud of how the peo-
ple of the great State of Ohio have 
given their time and resources to help 
those in need. 
Tonight 
in 
Cincinnati, 
OH—my 
hometown—we have organized a fund-
raiser, under the leadership of Susie 
DeYoung, for what is called World Cen-
tral Kitchen. They do great work all 
around the globe, including here in the 
United States, in response to natural 
disasters, working with FEMA. But 
they are doing amazing things in 
Ukraine. The funding for the fundraiser 
tonight is going to go to World Central 
Kitchen and also to the Kharkiv sister 
city efforts I talked about earlier. 
I have seen the good work that DC 
Chef Jose Andres, and his brainchild 
World Central Kitchen, is doing when I 
volunteered, along with a few of my 
colleagues, at a World Central Kitchen 
location, serving food to refugees—one 
of his 60 popup kitchens—in the border 
areas between Ukraine and its neigh-
bors. 
Tonight, in Cincinnati, chefs from 
our entire Cincinnati region are volun-
teering their skills and some great food 
for the people of Ukraine. All of these 
donations are a reflection of how the 
American people are united in support 
of Ukraine. 
On the sanctions front, I hope we can 
focus more of our attention on energy. 
I believe the top priority of all 
Ukraine’s allies should be cutting off 
the funding of Putin’s war machine. 
The single largest source of that fund-
ing is, of course, their energy exports 
from Russia. Europe relies on these en-
ergy exports from Russia. They pur-
chase approximately $870 million of en-
ergy from Russia every single day. 
That is one reason the ruble has re-
gained some of its value—because these 
energy receipts are coming in to fund 
Russia’s government and fund the war 
machine. 
For Europe, it is about $22 million 
worth of coal every day, $415 million 
worth of oil, and $433 million in natural 
gas every day, again, funding Russia’s 
brutal assault on Ukraine. 
I have talked about this on the floor 
before, but Putin has long used energy 
as a weapon, and we have got to put an 
end to it. 
I applaud those European nations 
that have recently taken steps to find 
alternative sources of energy and tran-
sition away from Russia. For example, 
recently, Italy, which relies on Russia 
for approximately 40 percent of its nat-
ural gas, is actively working to secure 
new natural gas contracts with African 
nations. 
And in the last month, Lithuania be-
came the first European country to 
halt the import of all Russian gas. 
The EU took its first tangible step 
away from Russian fuels last month 
when it finally agreed to ban coal im-
ports from Russia. This is expected to 
take effect in August. 
As part of their efforts to mark V-E 
Day on Sunday, the G7, which includes, 
France, Germany, Italy, Britain, Can-
ada, and the United States, pledged to 
ban Russian oil. Well, that is good. But 
let’s be sure that this pledge is con-
verted into reality. We have seen 
agreements before with the EU on this 
topic, and yet we need to be sure we see 
actual action. 
A total embargo on all energy—oil, 
gas, natural gas, coal—is needed. The 
United States has the energy re-
sources, especially liquefied natural 
gas, to be able to substitute for what 
Russia has been sending to Europe. 
To be there for Europe, the United 
States must immediately expand our 
oil and natural gas production here and 
build the associated energy infrastruc-
ture that will allow our hydrocarbons 
to reach the global market. 
Reports are showing that last month 
in April, European LNG import termi-
nals—so bringing liquefied natural gas 
into Europe from the United States but 
also from the Mideast—took in a 
record amount, hitting their highest 
level since the start of the pandemic. 
We have got to continue to build on 
that trajectory. We have already got a 
general agreement in place with the 
EU to do that, but certain countries 
have blocked its implementation. 
More generally, we have got to sup-
port all of our domestic producers here 
in the United States through a robust 
‘‘all of the above’’ energy policy that 
includes renewables, fossil fuels, car-
bon 
capture 
technologies, 
nuclear 
power, hydropower, hydrogen, and en-
ergy efficiency—all of the above. 
Instead of making it more difficult 
for domestic energy production, I urge 
the Biden administration to reject

their proposed tax increase on energy 
production proposed in the President’s 
budget; stop restricting new leases on 
Federal lands and waters for oil and 
gas production and help with the per-
mitting of the needed infrastructure 
instead of proposals like rewriting the 
definitions of the waters of the United 
States, which would add significant 
time and complexity to permitting new 
energy projects. This is a time when we 
need to focus on how to help Europe 
get away from their dependency on 
Russian energy in order to stop fueling 
the Putin war machine. 
I have mentioned sanctions over 
these past 11 weeks, from trading sanc-
tions and eliminating Russia’s pre-
ferred tax status with the United 
States to banking sanctions to crush 
President Putin’s financial services 
economy. But we should and must go 
further, especially when Russia not 
only 
continues 
its 
onslaught 
on 
Ukrainians’ defensive combatants but 
on their noncombatants—on civilians. 
What they are doing, in so many in-
stances, is clearly war crimes. 
I call on the International Criminal 
Court, again, which has announced an 
investigation, to follow in Ukraine’s 
footsteps and immediately begin a War 
Crimes Tribunal. The evidence of war 
crimes is now clear. There should be no 
delay. 
Earlier, I spoke about the investment 
the United States has made since 2015 
in training Ukrainian troops and mod-
ernizing its military. We now know 
that investment is paying off because 
Ukrainian troops have outmaneuvered 
and pushed back on Russia’s military. 
Speaking to the current Russian in-
vasion, one Ukrainian officer told us: 
The biggest mistake the Russians made 
was giving us eight years to prepare for this. 
Thank goodness we had that time. 
We could have used it even more pro-
ductively, but we were able to make 
great progress. 
I close tonight on this because it 
shows why U.S. leadership around the 
world is so important: Without the bi-
partisan action of Congress and mul-
tiple 
administrations—including 
the 
Obama, Trump, and now Biden admin-
istrations—what Ukraine is achieving 
would not have been possible. That is 
why it is so important we take up this 
Ukrainian supplemental immediately, 
this week, and pass it into law. We 
have made a difference. We can con-
tinue to make a difference, but we are 
at a crucial point in this war. 
So much more needs to be done. But 
do you know what? I am hopeful. I am 
hopeful because of what we have all 
seen. Over the past 2 months, the resil-
iency and fortitude of the Ukrainian 
Armed Forces and the Ukrainian peo-
ple, it has shown the world what patri-
otism and bravery truly is. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session for a pe-
riod of morning business, with Sen-
ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
was unable to cast a vote on rollcall 
vote No. 148 the motion to instruct the 
conferees of the United States Innova-
tion and Competition Act of 2021 of-
fered by Senator BARRASSO. The mo-
tion would force the administration to 
immediately develop a 5-year offshore 
oil and gas leasing plan that includes a 
minimum of 10 region-wide oil and gas 
lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and 
Alaska regions of the Outer Conti-
nental 
Shelf—OCS—with 
two 
sales 
every year. 
Had I been present, I would have 
voted against the motion. Rather than 
tying the administration’s hands with 
an arbitrary timetable for offshore 
leases, we should be carefully weighing 
the risks and benefits of such projects 
to each offshore ecosystem while diver-
sifying our energy sources, enhancing 
our energy efficiency, and encouraging 
the transition to clean renewable en-
ergy. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. JOSH DAVIS 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Dr. 
Josh Davis, of Wichita, KS. 
Dr. Davis is an emergency room phy-
sician at Ascension Via Christi St. 
Francis Hospital in Wichita. Like 
many of us, Josh was deeply disturbed 
by the widespread human suffering 
caused by Russia’s bloody invasion of 
Ukraine. What makes him different 
than most, however, was his resolve to 
be a part of the solution. After seeing 
the images of Ukrainian refugees flee-
ing their homes, Josh knew he needed 
to help. On April 14, he boarded a plane 
to war-torn Ukraine, not knowing 
where he would be going or what he 
would be doing. All he knew was that 
he was going to help those in need. 
While in Ukraine, Josh helped trans-
port medical supplies and patients, 
while also providing refugee children 
with much needed medical treatment. 
He also brought two suitcases full of 
gauze, bandages, rubber gloves, and 
other much-needed medical supplies 
with him. While in Ukraine, he saw 
firsthand the destruction and suffering 
that war brings. The biggest lesson 
learned for Josh was that this wide-
spread suffering cannot be stopped by 
the actions of a few, but that change 
will only come from the actions of 
many. He has already begun to make 
plans to return to Ukraine in order to 
provide further medical support and re-
lief. 
I would like to thank Josh for all 
that he has done. He has been an exem-
plary representative for the great 
State of Kansas, and the United States 
of America. His service to others 
makes us all proud. I now ask my col-
leagues to join me in honoring Dr. Josh 
Davis for his selflessness and service to 
those in need, as well as in wishing him 
the best of luck in the future. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO RYAN PFEIFER 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize Ryan 
Pfeifer of Topeka, KS. 
Ryan was presented with a $25,000 
Milken Educator Award at a recent 
Washburn Rural High School assembly. 
This award has an outstanding reputa-
tion in the teaching world. To some, it 
is known as the ‘‘Oscars of Teaching.’’ 
This award celebrates teachers’ work 
with students and shines a light on 
their future work as educators. In addi-
tion to the financial award, he was 
given mentorship and support, along 
with an all-expenses-paid trip to a 
forum where other recipients come to-
gether. 
The Milken Educator Award looks to 
honor unrecognized teachers. It has 
teams of administrators and State edu-
cation departments vetting out final-
ists for the award. Teachers are un-
aware they are nominated, so when 
Pfeifer was called down to the gym 
floor to receive the award, he was 
thrilled. Ryan has a way with his stu-
dents. Students describe him as relat-
able and dedicated, which is a great 
reputation to hold. He even gave up his 
regular planning and advising period to 
provide additional support for stu-
dents. I truly believe that he deserved 
this award. He has helped so many stu-
dents live up to their potential. A pre-
vious award winner, Brad Nicks, said 
‘‘He’s always stood out as one of those 
exceptional educators, somebody that 
builds really important relationships 
with students.’’ I ask my colleagues to 
join me in recognizing the wonderful 
impact Mr. Pfeifer has had on his stu-
dents and to honor him for this great 
accomplishment.

100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EL 
DORADO BAND 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize the 
100th anniversary of the El Dorado 
Band. 
The purpose of the El Dorado Munic-
ipal Band is to provide musical enter-
tainment in the summer for the city of 
El Dorado and to provide the oppor-
tunity for musicians from high school 
age and above to perform. The band 
began as the El Dorado Boys Band in 
the early 1920s, and is one of the oldest 
municipal bands in Kansas. The band’s 
first public home was a traditional 
round band shell at Gordy Park in the

heart of El Dorado. Its current home is 
a permanent band shell at Forest Park, 
located at Ninth and Taylor. This out-
door brick and concrete performance 
space was constructed in 1939 through 
the Works Progress Administration, 
WPA. 
The El Dorado Municipal Band cele-
brates 100 years of continuous perform-
ances with the 2022 summer concert 
season. Despite wars, natural disasters, 
pandemics, and other obstacles, the 
band continues to bring the young and 
old together, both on stage and in the 
audience. The band partners with vet-
erans’ organizations to celebrate Flag 
Day. It also holds old-fashioned ice 
cream socials and bake sales that help 
fund music scholarships to deserving 
youth at Butler Community College. 
The 2022 performance season will kick 
off with a director’s concert, bringing 
back all of the surviving directors that 
have stood before the Municipal Band. 
It will also feature the world public 
premiere of ‘‘El Dorado Fanfare,’’ a 
music composition by Ed Huckeby 
commissioned to celebrate 100 years of 
music. In addition to local perform-
ances each Thursday, the Municipal 
Band has been invited to perform for 
the Kansas Bandmaster’s Association 
as a featured ensemble. 
I am honored to be from El Dorado 
and associated with this great band. I 
remember hearing the band play and 
have always enjoyed the time shared 
with my family listening to their 
music. I ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing this wonderful munic-
ipal band and congratulate them in 
celebrating 100 years of music.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
623—CALL-
ING 
ON 
THE 
SECRETARY 
OF 
STATE TO DESIGNATE THE RUS-
SIAN FEDERATION AS A STATE 
SPONSOR OF TERRORISM 
Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 623 
Whereas, pursuant to section 1754(c) of the 
John S. McCain National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (50 U.S.C. 
4813(c)), section 40 of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act (22 U.S.C. 2779A), and section 620A of 
the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 
2371), the authority to designate a country as 
a state sponsor of terrorism rests with the 
Secretary of State; 
Whereas Cuba, the Democratic People’s 
Republic of North Korea, Iran, and Syria are 
designated as state sponsors of terrorism; 
Whereas, at the direction of President 
Vladimir Putin, the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation has and continues to pro-
mote acts of international terrorism against 
political opponents and nation states; 
Whereas, under the orders of President 
Putin, the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration engaged in a campaign of terror, uti-
lizing brutal force targeting civilians during 
the Second Chechen War; 
Whereas actions by the Government of the 
Russian Federation against civilian centers, 
such as Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, left 
countless innocent men, women, and chil-
dren dead or wounded; 
Whereas, since 2014, the Government of the 
Russian Federation has supported separat-
ists engaging in acts of violence against 
Ukrainian civilians in the Donbas region; 
Whereas, since the entry of the Russian 
Federation into the Syrian Civil War in 2015, 
the Russian Federation has targeted inno-
cent civilians in Syria with attacks on civil-
ian markets, medical facilities, and schools; 
Whereas the Government of the Russian 
Federation provides material support to 
Syria, a nation currently designated as a 
state sponsor of terrorism, that has been 
used to target the Syrian people; 
Whereas, according to the Congressional 
Research Service, the Russian Federation 
spreads terror throughout the world through 
private military networks of mercenaries, 
such as the Wagner Group, in an effort to 
‘‘project power cheaply and deniably’’; 
Whereas the Wagner Group collaborates 
with the Ministry of Defense of the Russian 
Federation to support the foreign policy ob-
jectives of the Russian Federation; 
Whereas the Department of the Treasury 
identifies the Wagner Group as ‘‘a designated 
Russian Ministry of Defense proxy force’’ 
and states that ‘‘Wagner’s activities in other 
countries, including Ukraine, Syria, Sudan, 
and Libya, have generated insecurity and in-
cited violence against innocent civilians’’; 
Whereas it was reported in February 2022 
that more than 400 Russian mercenaries 
from the Wagner Group were dispatched to 
Kyiv with orders from the Kremlin to assas-
sinate President Volodymyr Zelensky and 
members of the Government of Ukraine; 
Whereas, on March 14, 2022, Chairperson-in- 
Office of the Organization for Security and 
Co-operation in Europe Zbigniew Rau stated 
that actions of the Government of the Rus-
sian Federation in Ukraine against innocent 
civilians and civilian infrastructure is ‘‘state 
terrorism’’; 
Whereas, on March 17, 2022, President 
Volodymyr Zelensky called for the world to 
acknowledge the Russian Federation as a 
terrorist state; 
Whereas the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine 
has appealed to Congress to encourage the 
Department of State to recognize the Rus-
sian Federation as a state sponsor of ter-
rorism noting that ‘‘the Russian Federation 
has for years supported and financed ter-
rorist regimes and terrorist organizations, 
including being the main supplier of weapons 
to the Assad regime in Syria and supporting 
terrorists in the Middle East and Latin 
America, organizing acts of international 
terrorism, including the poisoning of the 
Skripal family in the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 
downing of a civilian Malaysian airliner and 
other acts of terrorism’’; 
Whereas, on April 27, 2022, Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken stated before Congress 
that ‘‘there’s no doubt in my mind that the 
Russians are terrorizing the Ukrainian peo-
ple’’; 
Whereas, at the direction of President 
Putin, the Russian Federation has and con-
tinues to commit war crimes by directing 
and authorizing the indiscriminate targeting 
of civilian centers within Chechnya, Georgia, 
Syria, and Ukraine, resulting in the deaths 
of countless innocent men, women, and chil-
dren; 
Whereas armed forces of the Russian Fed-
eration have committed numerous summary 
executions against innocent civilians and 
have attempted to cover their atrocities 
with mass graves across Ukraine; and 
Whereas, when responding to questions re-
garding designating the Russian Federation 
as a state sponsor of terrorism, the spokes-
person for the Department of State stated 
that ‘‘we are going to look at all potential 
options—options that are available to us 
under the law, options that would be effec-
tive in holding Russia to account—and if a 
tool is available and effective, we won’t hesi-
tate to use it’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) views the actions of the Government of 
the Russian Federation, at the direction of 
President Vladimir Putin, as acts of ter-
rorism; and 
(2) calls on the Secretary of State to des-
ignate the Russian Federation as a state 
sponsor of terrorism.

Mr. MANCHIN, Mr. COTTON, Ms. BALD-
WIN, Ms. ERNST, Mr. KELLY, Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR, and Mr. SCOTT of Florida) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 624 
Whereas drug traffickers are mass-pro-
ducing fake or counterfeit pills and falsely 
marketing them as legitimate prescription 
pills to deceive the people of the United 
States; 
Whereas many fake or counterfeit pills are 
made to look like prescription name-brand 
opioids or stimulants; 
Whereas drug traffickers are using fake or 
counterfeit pills to exploit the opioid crisis 
and prescription drug misuse; 
Whereas the Drug Enforcement Agency (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘DEA’’) has 
observed a dramatic rise in the number of 
counterfeit pills containing not less than 2 
mg of fentanyl, which is considered a deadly 
dose; 
Whereas 4 out of every 10 pills with 
fentanyl tested by the DEA contain a poten-
tially lethal dose; 
Whereas counterfeit pills may also contain 
fentanyl-related 
substances 
and 
meth-
amphetamine; 
Whereas the number of counterfeit pills 
with fentanyl seized by law enforcement 
agencies has increased by nearly 502 percent 
since 2019; 
Whereas more than 9,500,000 counterfeit 
pills were seized within the last year, which 
exceeds the total number of seizures for the 
previous 2 years combined; 
Whereas fake or counterfeit pills have been 
identified in all 50 States and the District of 
Columbia; 
Whereas illicit fentanyl has also been de-
tected in street drugs such as heroin and co-
caine; 
Whereas, for the 12-month period ending in 
October 2021, more than 105,000 individuals in 
the United States died of drug-induced 
deaths, and 69,000 of those deaths involved il-
licit fentanyl; 
Whereas, over the last 20 years, drug-in-
duced deaths among individuals aged 15 to 35 
has increased 6-fold, largely driven by the in-
crease in illicit fentanyl drugs; 
Whereas, for the 12-month period ending in 
April 2021, the leading cause of death for in-
dividuals in the United States aged 18 to 45 
was illicit fentanyl; 
Whereas fake counterfeit pills are easily 
accessible and often sold on social media and 
e-commerce platforms, making them acces-
sible to teens and youth; 
Whereas illicit fentanyl is involved in 
more deaths of youths than all other drug 
types combined; 
Whereas, in 2020, drug overdose and poi-
soning deaths for individuals aged 14 to 18 
grew by 94 percent, which was more than 3 
times as fast as the national rate and faster 
than any other 5-year age group; 
Whereas, in 2020, fentanyl involvement in 
drug overdose and poisoning deaths for indi-
viduals aged 14 to 18 grew by 169 percent, 
which was more than 3 times as fast as the 
national rate and faster than any other 5- 
year age group; and 
Whereas, in 2020, there were 56,516 reported 
overdose deaths due to synthetic opioids; 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the recognition and goals of 
National Fentanyl Awareness Day, which in-
clude increasing individual and public aware-
ness of the impact of fake or counterfeit 
fentanyl pills on families and young people; 
(2) applauds the work of Federal, State, 
and local law enforcement agencies that 
work to combat the proliferation of counter-
feit pills; 
(3) encourages the use of existing authori-
ties to proactively stop and prevent the 
spread of illicit counterfeit pills; and 
(4) designates May 10, 2022 as ‘‘National

Mr. 
SCOTT
of 
Florida, 
and 
Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 625 
Whereas charter schools are public schools 
that do not charge tuition and enroll any 
student who wants to attend, often through 
a random lottery when the demand for en-
rollment is outmatched by the supply of 
available charter school seats; 
Whereas high-performing public charter 
schools deliver a high-quality public edu-
cation and challenge all students to reach 
their potential for academic success; 
Whereas public charter schools promote in-
novation and excellence in public education; 
Whereas public charter schools throughout 
the United States provide millions of fami-
lies with diverse and innovative educational 
options for the children of those families; 
Whereas high-performing public charter 
schools and charter management organiza-
tions are increasing student achievement 
and attendance rates at institutions of high-
er education; 
Whereas public charter schools are author-
ized by a designated entity and— 
(1) respond to the needs of communities, 
families, and students in the United States; 
and 
(2) promote the principles of quality, ac-
countability, choice, high-performance, and 
innovation; 
Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and 
autonomy, public charter schools are held 
accountable by the authorizers of the char-
ter schools for improving student achieve-
ment and for sound financial and operational 
management; 
Whereas public charter schools are re-
quired to meet the student achievement ac-
countability requirements under the Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in the same man-
ner as traditional public schools; 
Whereas public charter schools often set 
higher expectations for students, beyond the 
requirements of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 
et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools 
are of high quality and truly accountable to 
the public; 
Whereas 44 States, the District of Colum-
bia, Guam, and Puerto Rico have public 
charter schools; 
Whereas, as of the 2020–2021 school year, 
more than 7,700 public charter schools served 
approximately 3,600,000 children; 
Whereas enrollment in public charter 
schools grew from 400,000 students in 2001 to 
3,600,000 students in 2021, a more than nine-
fold increase in 20 years; 
Whereas in the United States— 
(1) in 234 school districts, more than 10 per-
cent of public school students are enrolled in 
public charter schools; and 
(2) in at least 27 school districts, at least 30 
percent of public school students are en-
rolled in public charter schools; 
Whereas public charter schools improve 
the achievement of students enrolled in the 
charter schools and collaborate with tradi-
tional public schools to improve public edu-
cation for all students; 
Whereas public charter schools— 
(1) give parents the freedom to choose pub-
lic schools; 
(2) routinely measure parental satisfaction 
levels; and 
(3) must prove the ongoing success of the 
charter schools to parents, policymakers, 
and the communities served by the charter 
schools or risk closure; 
Whereas a 2015 report from the Center for 
Research on Education Outcomes at Stan-
ford University found significant improve-
ments for students at urban charter schools, 
and, when compared to peers in traditional 
public schools, each year those students 
completed the equivalent of 28 more days of 
learning in reading and 40 more days of 
learning in math; 
Whereas a 2020 study from the Program on 
Education Policy and Governance at Harvard 
University found greater academic gains for 
students in charter schools than for students 
in traditional public schools who took the 
reading and math assessments administered 
by the National Assessment of Educational 
Progress (NAEP) in fourth and eighth grade 
between 2005 and 2017, and African American 
and low-income students attending charter 
schools were almost 6 months ahead of their 
peers in reading and math compared with 
students in traditional public schools over 
the 12-year span of the study; 
Whereas 
parental 
demand 
for 
charter 
schools is high, and there was a 7 percent 
growth in charter school enrollment between 
the 2019–2020 and 2020–2021 school years; and 
Whereas the 23rd annual National Charter 
Schools Week is scheduled to be celebrated 
the week of May 8 through May 14, 2022: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the students, families, 
teachers, leaders, and staff of public charter 
schools across the United States for— 
(A) making ongoing contributions to pub-
lic education; 
(B) making impressive strides in closing 
the academic achievement gap in schools in 
the United States, particularly in schools
