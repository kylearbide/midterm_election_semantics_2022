f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate has spent the last few days like 
all Americans have, praying for quick 
healing and smooth recovery for Presi-
dent Trump and the First Lady fol-
lowing their positive COVID–19 tests. 
I spoke to the President by phone 
twice this past weekend. Both times, 
his spirits were high. Both times, we 
talked about the people’s business: our 
Nation’s fight against this pandemic; 
his exceptional nominee to the Su-
preme Court, Judge Barrett; as well as 
our efforts to continue rebuilding the 
economy for working families. 
We are also thinking of our friends 
and colleagues, the senior Senator for 
Utah, the senior Senator for Wisconsin, 
and the junior Senator for North Caro-
lina, who are currently working from 
home. The standard cliche would say 
that these past few days have provided 
a stark reminder of the dangers of this 
terrible virus, but the truth is that our 
Nation did not need any such reminder. 
More than 209,000 of our fellow citi-
zens have lost their lives. Millions have 
battled illness or had their lives dis-
rupted by positive tests. This past 
weekend, my home State of Kentucky 
just recorded its highest ever—highest 
ever—one-day total for new cases. We 
all need to remain vigilant. We all need 
to remain careful. 
If the Speaker of the House and the 
Democratic 
leader 
had 
not 
spent 
months blocking another bipartisan re-
lief package over unrelated, far-left 
poison pills, we could have put hun-
dreds of billions more dollars for kids, 
jobs, and healthcare in the pipeline 
many weeks ago. 
For the sake of our Nation, let’s hope 
they finally lay down their partisan de-
mands and let our country get back on 
offense against this disease. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, in 
just a moment, I will move to with-
draw the pending cloture petitions and 
recess the Senate with pro forma meet-
ings until 2 weeks from today. Mem-
bers will receive at least 24 hours’ no-
tice if any votes on urgent matters are 
scheduled 
before 
October 
19. 
That 
would take bipartisan consent. Other-
wise, the full Senate will next meet on 
October 19.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6034 
October 5, 2020 
Obviously, the people’s business does 
not come to a halt in the absence of 
votes on the floor. The important work 
of our committees will go forward as 
each committee sees fit. Chairman 
GRAHAM has already announced the Ju-
diciary 
Committee 
will 
meet 
as 
planned on October 12 to begin consid-
ering Judge Barrett’s nomination to 
the Supreme Court. We are full steam 
ahead with the fair, thorough, and 
timely 
confirmation 
process 
that 
Judge Barrett, the Court, and the Na-
tion deserve. 
The chairman has indicated the com-
mittee will use the same hybrid for-
mat—with some participants appearing 
in person and others appearing over 
video—that it has successfully used for 
more than 20 prior hearings this year. 
Let me say that again. The Judiciary 
Committee 
alone—just 
that 
com-
mittee—has held more than 20 hybrid 
hearings since the start of the pan-
demic. Many of these saw multiple 
Senators participating via video con-
ference. Some of them saw nominees 
participating by video conference. At 
times, the Democratic members of the 
committee have gone literally out of 
their way to praise this technology and 
the chairman’s flexibility with this for-
mat. 
Across all of our committees, we 
have had 150 hybrid hearings since the 
pandemic began. The Senate has used 
this format no fewer than 150 times. We 
have continued performing our con-
stitutional 
duties 
while 
protecting 
health and safety during the pandemic. 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have 
largely welcomed this approach, and 
they have frequently taken advantage 
of it. So whatever mix proves to be the 
right decision at this time next week, 
it will be completely consistent with 
the committee’s own precedent and 
with the ways committees all across 
the Senate have adapted and done their 
work throughout the pandemic. 
Our whole society is using these 
tools. 
Earlier 
today, 
the 
Supreme 
Court itself resumed conducting oral 
arguments via teleconference, as it has 
done since last spring. The Senate has 
been using these processes for months. 
Just yesterday, the ranking member of 
the Rules Committee reminded the 
country that she actually helped set 
them up. 
It is nonsense for Senate Democrats 
to turn on a dime and now pretend 
these 
procedures 
are 
somehow 
no 
longer workable. It is nonsense to sug-
gest that the tools that Senate Demo-
crats have been happily using across 
all of our committees for months have 
suddenly gone bad overnight. 
Nobody is taking these disingenuous 
tactics at face value because the Demo-
crats have told everyone, out loud, 
about their real intentions. For weeks 
now, numerous Senate Democrats have 
publicly promised they would try every 
trick in the book—every trick in the 
book—every maneuver available, to ob-
struct and delay a fair confirmation 
process. 
Weeks ago, the junior Senator from 
Hawaii pledged: ‘‘I will look for every 
procedural tool that I can [find] to 
make sure that this does not happen.’’ 
Weeks ago, the senior Senator from 
Massachusetts: ‘‘We need to use every 
tool. . . . We need to think seriously 
about everything we can do to try to 
slow this down.’’ 
The No. 2 Democratic Senator, our 
friend from Illinois, has said: ‘‘we [will] 
use whatever tools we have available’’ 
to ‘‘slow things down.’’ 
Just yesterday, in the very same 
press conference where the Democratic 
leader claimed that his latest call to 
delay the hearings were rooted in 
health and safety concerns, he gave the 
game away just moments later. In that 
same press conference, he admitted, 
‘‘We will use every tool in the toolbox 
to delay’’—so much about health and 
safety concerns. 
Our Democratic colleagues have ad-
mitted out loud what all these stalling 
tactics are about. Senate Democrats 
have openly admitted they are grasp-
ing at straws to block the exceedingly 
well-qualified nominee from receiving 
a fair and prompt process. 
Look, we have months of experience 
governing this way while protecting 
health and safety here in the Senate. 
This body will not cease to function 
just because Democrats are afraid they 
may lose a vote. Chairman GRAHAM has 
all the options and procedures he needs 
to supervise a fair, thorough, and hope-
fully dignified confirmation hearing 
next week. That is just what is going 
to happen. 
I look forward to seeing Judge 
Barrett’s brilliance and qualifications 
on full display starting 1 week from 
today. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Virginia. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I would 
like to add, on behalf of my Demo-
cratic colleagues, the concerns ex-
pressed for the President and First 
Lady, that they recover quickly and 
fully. 
Having had coronavirus—likely con-
tracted here when we were working on 
the CARES Act in March—I understand 
how tricky this can be and, knowing 
four people who died of coronavirus, 
how serious it can be. Our prayer is 
that this is a mild case, and it passes 
quickly. 
I also extend the same concern on be-
half of my Democratic colleagues for 
the Members of the Senate who have 
recently tested positive and hope that 
they either have no symptoms or the 
symptoms pass quickly. 
I couldn’t help but notice, as I came 
into the Senate today on the subway 
from the Russell building, that there is 
an advisory that has been posted for 
months down at the entrance to the 
Senate that says that we are trying to 
follow CDC guidelines, but the advisory 
placard says nothing about masks— 
nothing. 
I have wondered about that as I 
passed before it in the past, but in light 
of the experience over the last few 
days, I think in order to fairly follow 
science-based guidelines and give peo-
ple warnings about what they should 
do to protect their health, we might 
consider a different placard. 
Briefly, with respect to the majority 
leader’s comments—I would love to be 
working on a COVID bill. The House 
passed a Democratic preferred COVID 
bill—the Heroes Act—in May. I under-
stand the majority leader and his col-
leagues find things about it they don’t 
like. 
There is no expectation that they 
would just take up the House Demo-
cratic bill and pass it, but we waited 
through May and then June and then 
July and then August, until finally, in 
mid to late September, the majority 
put a bill on the floor that we viewed, 
frankly, as insufficient. 
It contained no funds for State and 
local government aid, no funds for 
rental or mortgage assistance, no funds 
for SNAP benefits or food aid. It would 
have stricken State laws, such as those 
that had been passed in Virginia to try 
to provide a workplace safety standard 
for people returning to work in the 
days of COVID. 
We voted the bill down, as the major-
ity leader knows, but we did so with 
the expectation that that no vote 
would function much like the no vote 
in March functioned when we came in 
on a Sunday and we voted down a par-
tisan proposal, and a few days later, we 
had a bipartisan proposal—the CARES 
Act—that has helped millions and mil-
lions of Americans, small businesses, 
hospitals, families. 
We hope that no vote would lead to 
the same negotiation that could poten-
tially find a solution for Americans 
who are still looking for relief, but the 
majority wants to now move to a dif-
ferent topic. They want to now speed 
through a Supreme Court nomination 
with an unprecedented speed and, in-
deed, an unprecedented process. 
I understand that the majority leader 
might categorize the Democrats’ con-
cerns about proceeding at a time of 
great sickness as a procedural trick, 
but 
I 
don’t 
think 
there 
is 
any 
unreasonableness to a Judiciary Com-
mittee member’s request that a hear-
ing on the single most important ap-
pointment that the Senate might make 
should be done in person. If it is done 
in person, it should be done in person 
in a way that is safe. That is the re-
quest the Democrats would have and 
that we continue to believe would be in 
accord with the institution’s norms but 
also the best thing for the safety of all 
Members. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6035 
October 5, 2020 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session and 
be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has 
been said that the United States is like 
a brilliant tapestry woven from a daz-
zling array of colors and patterns into 
a unique whole. If that is true, then the 
contributions of Hispanics are surely 
among the largest and most vibrant 
swaths in our rich national tapestry, 
and Hispanic Heritage Month is a good 
time to reflect on those contributions. 
This celebration runs each year from 
mid-September to mid-October. The 
dates were chosen to coincide with the 
dates in which several Latin American 
nations—including Costa Rica, El Sal-
vador, 
Guatemala, 
Honduras, 
Nica-
ragua, Mexico, and Chile—celebrate 
their own independence from colonial 
rule. This national celebration used to 
be just a week long, but in 1988, Con-
gress wisely and unanimously voted to 
expand Hispanic Heritage Week to His-
panic Heritage Month. The legislation 
was sponsored by Congressman Esteban 
Torres and my friend and political 
mentor, Senator Paul Simon. It was 
signed into law by President Ronald 
Reagan, a proud, conservative Repub-
lican who understood that America’s 
heritage as a nation of immigrants is 
one 
of 
our 
greatest 
sources 
of 
strength—economically, 
politically, 
culturally and morally. 
The contributions and influence of 
Latinos on our Nation has grown dra-
matically in the three decades since 
the establishment of Hispanic Heritage 
Month. Today there are more than 60 
million Latinos in the U.S. Illinois is 
proud to be home to one of the largest 
Latino populations in the country, in-
cluding many people of Mexican, Puer-
to Rican, and Guatemalan heritage. 
Latinos and Latinas are leaders in 
every walk of life, including business, 
the arts, sciences, education, sports, 
entertainment, and public service. A 
‘‘wise 
Latina,’’ 
Justice 
Sonia 
Sotomayor, now serves on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. Ellen Ochoa, an engineer 
and the first Latina astronaut, is now 
director of NASA’s Johnson Space Cen-
ter. Latinas are literally helping Amer-
ica reach for the stars. 
In my home State of Illinois, Dr. 
Juan Andrade, Jr., is the president of 
the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, 
based in Chicago. He and his organiza-
tion are doing critical work to educate 
and motivate Latinos to vote and to 
fill out the Census, ensuring that 
Latinos are seen and their voices 
heard. Alexis Esparza is president of 
Economic Strategies Development Cor-
poration. For nearly half a century, his 
organization, ESDC, has worked in the 
Pilsen community of Chicago to pre-
serve historic buildings, build afford-
able new housing, and help create new 
commercial and industrial economic 
development opportunities. They are 
part of a long and proud tradition of 
Hispanic men and women whose work 
has made America’s economy more 
prosperous and fairer for all of us. 
Many Americans know the names 
Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. In 
1966, these two brave labor leaders 
helped organize farm workers in Dela-
no, CA, to form the United Farm Work-
ers of America. Standing together, 
backed by their union, the farm work-
ers were able to strike for higher 
wages, safer working conditions, and 
protections for women farm workers 
from sexual violence. 
Far fewer people recognize the name 
Guadalupe Marshall. She is also a hero 
for workers’ rights. Let me tell you 
about her. On Memorial Day 1937, 10 
unarmed union demonstrators from Re-
public Steele were shot down by police 
in Chicago. Lupe Marshall, who had 
immigrated to America from Mexico 
when she was 10 years old, was one of 
the people attending that strike. She 
was a mother of three and a volunteer 
social worker at the Jane Addams Hull 
House. The ‘‘Memorial Day Massacre’’ 
is how many history books label the 
carnage at Republic Steele. Three 
weeks after the killings, Lupe Marshall 
travelled to Washington, DC, to testify 
before the Senate about what she had 
witnessed. 
She described placing herself on the 
front line when shots rang out and then 
turning to see many people lying face 
down on the ground. She ran, but she 
was clubbed in the head and arrested. 
Her courage helped to build support 
among the American people and in 
Congress for laws to help working peo-
ple stand together for fair wages, safe 
working conditions, and civil rights. 
During 
this 
Hispanic 
Heritage 
Month, we are especially aware of the 
enormous contributions that Hispanic 
Americans continue to make to Amer-
ica’s economy. Sadly, we know that 
this COVID–19 pandemic is taking a 
disproportionate toll on Black and 
Brown Americans. Nationwide, Latinos 
are being hospitalized with COVID–19 
at more than 41⁄2 times the rate of 
White people. In Illinois and several 
other States, Latinos have the highest 
COVID–19 infection rates of any ethnic 
group. COVID–19 is also threatening 
the livelihoods of Latinos throughout 
the US. Almost 60 percent of Latino 
households have experienced job loss or 
wage reductions during this pandemic. 
At the same time, our Nation is rely-
ing heavily on Latinos, both citizens 
and immigrants, to help steer us safely 
through this pandemic. Latinos are 
working on the frontlines of this pan-
demic as doctors, nurses, and home 
healthcare workers. They are also 
working around the clock, behind the 
scenes, to disinfect our workplaces, 
schools, stores, and health centers. 
Latino farm workers continue to work 
in the fields and in packing plants, har-
vesting, and preparing the food that 
keeps us fed. Despite the virus and, 
now, the thick smoke of wildfires blan-
keting much of the west coast, they re-
main on the job. 
Latinos 
are 
working 
as 
grocery 
clerks, 
teachers, 
postal 
employees, 
servicemembers, and other ‘‘essential 
worker jobs.’’ Many of these heroic es-
sential workers are immigrants, and 
many are Dreamers. They continue to 
work and serve in their communities 
while their own status remains in 
limbo. 
Latino-owned businesses are one of 
the fastest growing segments of Amer-
ica’s economy. Nationwide, nearly 1-in- 
4 newly created businesses today are 
Latino-owned. More than 4 million 
Latino-owned businesses provide jobs 
for 2.7 million workers. Together, these 
businesses pump over $700 billion into 
America’s economy. In Illinois, 120,000 
Latino-owned businesses generate $15 
billion and create jobs for 100,000 work-
ers. These passionate entrepreneurs are 
the heart and pride of their commu-
nities. I see them in communities all 
across Illinois. Let me tell you about 
some of them. 
In Chicagoland, Latino community 
and business leaders have created pro-
grams such as the Food for Hope Pro-
gram and the Big Shoulders Fund to 
distribute free food to families who are 
hungry because of economic hardships 
related to the pandemic. 
Pedro Perez owns his own mainte-
nance company, PCY General Services. 
He and his daughter are part of a team 
that diligently disinfects Esperanza 
Health Centers on the Southwest Side 
of Chicago to make sure that the space 
is safe for families and for the medical 
professionals who work there. What is 
even more remarkable is that he does 
all of this without charge. Why? Pedro 
says, with a smile, because ‘‘it’s his 
community.’’ Every day, in every com-
munity in Illinois and every corner of 
America, you can find stories like 
theirs. 
The beauty and richness of the 
Latino community goes beyond food 
and traditions. At the heart of the 
Latino community is an exceptionally 
resilient spirit that has sustained them 
through history and is helping to sus-
tain America today through the most 
severe health and economic crises most 
of us has ever experienced. I am hon-
ored to represent so many of these 
hard-working families in my State and 
look forward to see how they continue 
to inspire us to keep building a better 
America for everyone.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6036 
October 5, 2020 
Force in Europe during World War II, 
Dwight David Eisenhower. 
Without Ike, it is not a stretch to 
imagine that the trajectory of Amer-
ican history might have been signifi-
cantly altered. It was General Eisen-
hower who commanded a successful D- 
Day invasion, which became a pivotal 
turning point in the Second World War. 
It 
was 
President 
Eisenhower 
who 
waged peace, regulated atomic power, 
and protected the world against the 
growing 
spread 
of 
communism. 
Through it all, it was not selfish ambi-
tion or prestige that guided him, but 
rather his character and sense of duty. 
He was born in Denison, TX, on Octo-
ber 14, 1890, as the third of seven sons. 
At the age of 2, Ike’s family moved to 
Abilene, KS, a lively community with a 
famous frontier past where he devel-
oped his interest in exploring the out-
doors. Throughout his lifetime of lead-
ership, Ike never lost touch with his 
western origins. As Kansas’ favorite 
son, Ike nurtured the values he learned 
as a young boy, some of which guided 
his decision-making as a leader. He 
placed the job and the mission—not 
himself—at the center. With this heart-
felt ethic, he set the example for those 
around him. 
From Abilene to West Point and from 
Normandy to Washington, Eisenhower 
embodied the humility, honesty, sin-
cerity, optimism, and fortitude that he 
would call upon the country to emulate 
in his first inaugural address on Janu-
ary 20, 1953: ‘‘The productivity of our 
heads, our hands, and our hearts is the 
source of all the strength we can com-
mand, for both the enrichment of our 
lives and the winning of peace,’’ he de-
clared. ‘‘Whatever America hopes to 
bring to pass in the world must first 
come to pass in the heart of America.’’ 
As Americans, we owe a great deal to 
the man who led the U.S. and Allied 
Forces in the liberation of Europe and 
expelled the evil of Hitler’s Nazism. On 
the domestic front, we are transformed 
by the fruit of his legacy as President, 
including: the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem, the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, the Department 
of Health, Education, and Welfare— 
now known as the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services and the 
U.S. Department of Education—and the 
Federal Aviation Administration. Ike 
also brought Alaska and Hawaii into 
the Union; eradicated segregation in 
our Armed Forces; and deployed the 
Army’s 101st Airborne to Central High 
School in Little Rock, AR, ensuring 
that the law of educational integration 
was followed by all States. 
As chairman of the Dwight D. Eisen-
hower Memorial Commission, I am 
proud to report that construction on 
the national memorial of President and 
General Eisenhower, located on Inde-
pendence Avenue, SW, between 4th and 
6th Streets, is complete, and the me-
morial is open to the public. 
The commission hosted a dedication 
ceremony at the site the evening of 
September 17, 2020. Participants in the 
ceremony included my fellow commis-
sioners, including vice chairman Rep-
resentative MIKE
THOMPSON
of Cali-
fornia, Senator JOE MANCHIN of West 
Virginia, Senator GARY
PETERS
Of 
Michigan, Senator DAN
SULLIVAN
of 
Alaska, Representative SANFORD

BISHOP, JR., OF GEORGIA, REPRESENTA-
TIVE

K. SIMPSON
of Idaho, 
Representative 
WILLIAM
M. 
‘‘MAC’’ 
THORNBERRY of Texas, former Senator 
Robert J. ‘‘Bob’’ Dole of Kansas, Alfred 
Geduldig, Susan Banes Harris, and 
Catherine Ann Stevens. 
Again, with General Eisenhower as 
they were on the eve of the D-Day in-
vasion, soldiers of the 101st Airborne 
Division presented the colors. Speakers 
included me, Bret Bair, Senate Chap-
lain Barry Black, Representative MIKE 
THOMPSON, Architect Frank Gehry, Ms. 
Rachel Mast of Kansas who recited the 
Pledge of Allegiance, Astronaut Chris 
Cassidy from the International Space 
Station, Secretary Condoleezza Rice, 
Greta Van Susteren who introduced 
Senator Bob Dole, David Eisenhower, 
Susan Eisenhower, and Secretary of 
the Interior David Bernhardt. Other Ei-
senhower family members present at 
the ceremony included Julie Nixon Ei-
senhower, their son Alex and his chil-
dren, Mary Jean Eisenhower’s son Mer-
rill Eisenhower Atwater, and several 
members of the Gill family, relatives of 
Mamie Doud Eisenhower.

mony and others joining via livestream 
and CSPAN were thrilled to experience 
a flyover of F–16s piloted by soldiers of 
the 177th Fighter Wing of the New Jer-
sey Air National Guard. The flyover oc-
curred precisely at the end of the Na-
tional Anthem performed by Voices of 
Service. Additionally, 26 members of 
the West Point Alumni Glee Club de-
lighted guests with superb renditions 
of several songs, including ‘‘Grand Old 
Flag,’’ ‘‘World War II Medley,’’ and 
‘‘God Bless the USA.’’ 
September’s 
dedication 
ceremony 
was a fitting tribute to one of our 
country’s finest leaders. The memorial 
is now one of the 420 National Memo-
rials and Parks under the stewardship 
of the National Park Service. I invite 
all to visit the new Dwight D. Eisen-
hower Memorial. 
I ask my fellow Senators and all citi-
zens to join me in celebrating Amer-
ica’s 34th President and Supreme Com-
mander during World War II by wishing 
Ike a happy 130th birthday.

OPENING OF THE CHEYENNE 
NATIONAL CEMETERY 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak on the opening of the Cheyenne 
National Cemetery and the hard work 
that has been put in to this project 
over the past few years. 
This is a historic accomplishment for 
Wyoming. 
The 
Cheyenne 
National 
Cemetery is the first veterans ceme-
tery in Wyoming that is run by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. Before I 
became a Senator, Wyoming was cam-
paigning for a national cemetery with-
in the State. Once I was in the Senate, 
I had the opportunity to help advance 
this project with the help of veterans, 
F.E. Warren Air Force Base, and the 
patriotic people of Wyoming. They are 
all to be congratulated, and I know all 
are thankful this day is finally here. 
The opening of this national ceme-
tery will allow veterans in rural areas 
to be buried in their home State. Be-
fore it was constructed, veterans had 
to go to neighboring States in order to 
be laid to rest. Now, the Cheyenne Na-
tional Cemetery will be used to serve 
approximately 22,000 veterans and their 
families. Wyoming has worked for a 
long time, in conjunction with the VA, 
to give our State veterans what they 
deserve: a place to rest in peace along-
side their fellow servicemembers. Bur-
ial services have also been expanded to 
veterans’ spouses and other eligible 
family members, for they too have sac-
rificed so much for their country. 
National cemeteries are a way to 
honor our service men and women and 
serve as a constant reminder that free-
dom isn’t free. It comes to us at great 
cost and tremendous personal sacrifice. 
Each name that has been enshrined has 
a story to tell about someone who left 
family and friends, safety and security 
behind to be part of a cause much 
greater than themselves. In the end, 
many of them gave up all of their to-
morrows so that today’s world might 
be a better place for us all to live. 
I am extremely proud of the steps 
that the VA and the great State of Wy-
oming have taken in order to honor our 
veterans. We must never forget the sac-
rifices of these brave men and women. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO MICHIGAN’S 
VETERANS 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay special tribute to the 
proud Michigan residents who have 
served in our Nation’s military and 
their families. 
When our country was at risk of frac-
turing in a brutal Civil War, the people 
of Michigan volunteered. When fascism 
threatened freedom around the world, 
the people of Michigan fought back. 
And when faced with new dangers— 
from terrorism to pandemic diseases— 
the people of Michigan remain willing 
to put our lives on the line on behalf of 
the American people. 
Whenever and wherever our Nation 
needs us, the people of Michigan al-
ways respond. In some families, this 
spirit of service stretches back genera-
tions. 
The Armsteads are one such Michi-
gan family. Peter Armstead was origi-
nally from England, but when his new 
Nation needed him, he answered the 
call. He fought during the Civil War

and barely survived his time in a Con-
federate prisoner of war camp in Mis-
sissippi. 
Earl Armstead, Peter’s grandson, 
served in France during World War I, 
where he was put in charge of destroy-
ing enemy bridges. He came home suf-
fering from post-traumatic stress and, 
like so many of our veterans, struggled 
to talk about what he had seen. 
And Robert Armstead, Earl’s nephew, 
also fought in Europe during World 
War II. He served in the Tank De-
stroyer Battalion and took part in the 
Po Valley campaign in Italy. His unit 
was being readied for the Pacific Cam-
paign when the war ended. 
All three of these veterans were will-
ing to sacrifice everything in defense of 
our Nation. This past August, a grate-
ful nation honored them with side-by- 
side burials at Great Lakes National 
Cemetery in Holly. 
Dr. Robert Armstead II, Robert’s son, 
worked to make this historic inter-
ment happen. He believes veterans de-
serve to be remembered and honored 
for their service. I couldn’t agree more. 
My own father, who served during 
World War II, always told me that vet-
erans should not stand at the back of 
any line. Our Nation must keep its 
promises to our heroes who have 
served, whether it is healthcare, edu-
cation, a chance at a good job, the 
military recognitions they earned in 
service, or a place of honor in our na-
tional cemeteries, places that Robert 
Armstead 
II 
calls 
‘‘sacred 
holy 
ground.’’ 
On this Veterans Day and every day, 
I salute all of Michigan’s veterans past 
and present. I salute their families, 
who sacrifice alongside them and help 
ensure that their stories are never for-
gotten. 
Thank you. 
f 
TRIBUTE 
TO 
MEL 
THOMPSON, 
GILDA LINTZ, KAY SHARP, AND 
CHAD TENPENNY 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President; I was 
first elected to the House of Represent-
atives in 1980 and then the Senate in 
1996. I have enjoyed the privilege of be-
coming the longest serving member of 
Congress in the history of the Sun-
flower State and representing Kansans 
in Washington, DC, for 40 years. 
It has been an amazing ride, a great 
partnership in government and many 
people have been a tremendous help to 
Franki and me. We want to say a 
heartfelt thank you to all the friends 
we have made along the way. 
My first boss in public service was a 
true gentleman from Concordia named 
Frank Carlson. Senator Carlson was 
the first person to hit the political 
trifecta and serve our State as Senator, 
Congressman, and Governor. The al-
ways modest Senator Carlson routinely 
said, ‘‘There are no self-made men or 
women in public service; it is your 
friends, family and staff who make you 
what you are.’’ 
Through the years I have repeated 
Senator Carlson’s words on many occa-
sions, and I truly believe that Members 
of Congress are only as good as their 
staff. Well, I have been blessed because, 
for four decades, I believe that I have 
had the best staff both in Kansas and 
on Capitol Hill. 
While I could offer a long list of cur-
rent and former aides who have truly 
made a difference for Kansas and 
America, there are three unique, hum-
ble, and accomplished individuals who 
deserve 
special 
recognition. 
Mel 
Thompson, Gilda Lintz, and Kay Sharp 
have all served quietly and effectively 
behind the scenes on my Kansas staff 
for nearly a quarter century. 
First, there is Mel Thompson who 
serves as my State agriculture rep-
resentative. Actually, Mel and I first 
worked together on the Washington 
staff of First District Congressman 
Keith Sebelius in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s. Mel has taught me a lot 
about agriculture and even more about 
people. Nobody is better at listening to 
frustrated farmers and ranchers and 
few know more about the complex and 
often burdensome regulations offered 
by USDA and EPA. This incredible 
knowledge and Mel’s neighborly pres-
ence led to well-deserved recognition 
by the Kansas Farm Bureau who hon-
ored Mel with a Distinguished Service 
to Agriculture award. Mel has been a 
strong advocate for me and, in fact, a 
brother. 
Next, there is Gilda Lintz who serves 
as the district director in my Topeka 
office. Gilda is what we call a casework 
specialist, serving as the court of last 
resort when communication has broken 
down between a Kansan and a govern-
ment agency. Gilda has invested her 
heart and soul into assisting veterans 
to obtain service awards or unrealized 
benefits. Additionally, Gilda has led 
my service academy nomination board 
that meets each October to identify the 
best and brightest Kansans capable of 
graduating from our Nation’s military 
academies and defending our Nation. I 
call her ‘‘golden.’’ Thank you, Gilda, 
for nurturing America’s heroes. You 
are a true ‘‘Kansas treasure. 
I also want to recognize Kay Sharp 
who serves as my State casework and 
outreach director. Kay joined my staff 
after a stint with Senator Nancy 
Kassebaum and has been a steady and 
dependable rock in the Overland Park 
office since 1997. Like Mel and Gilda, 
Kay is the foundation of Team Roberts. 
Kay leads my state casework effort and 
has helped countless Kansans obtain 
last minute passports, crucial IRS re-
fund checks, and meaningful social se-
curity disability payments. More re-
cently, like she did after 9–11, Kay 
worked after hours and late into the 
morning on weekends to ensure Ameri-
cans were able to re-enter the country 
during COVID-related travel interrup-
tions. Most of all, Kay is someone who 
I could count on for frank advice and 
counsel. She always gives you the un-
varnished truth, and for that, I am 
grateful. 
Finally, I want to say a word about 
my longtime State director and now 
chief of staff, Chad Tenpenny. Chad has 
been out there riding shotgun, covering 
all 105 counties, with me since my 
early days in the Senate. We have cov-
ered almost every inch of the State, 
from the Cimarron National Grasslands 
in Morton County to the eastern border 
in Wyandotte County. The people of 
Kansas know and respect Chad and de-
pend on him as a direct link to the 
Federal Government. His steady de-
pendable leadership in the State has 
been a gift to me and to all Kansans 
over the years. 
As a proud U.S. Marine, where I 
learned that I could achieve more than 
I ever thought I really could, I am con-
stantly urging my staff to ‘‘sprint to 
the finish line’’ and ‘‘take the Hill.’’ 
Mel, Gilda, and Kay have done a lot of 
sprinting and climbing through the 
years. Together, we have made Kansas 
a better place, and for that, I am 
proud. 
Semper Fi.

Whereas police officers are indispensable 
members of the community who put their 
lives on the line to protect others; 
Whereas promoting strong relationships 
founded in trust and mutual respect between 
law enforcement officers and the commu-
nities they serve helps ensure the safe and 
effective execution of the law; 
Whereas law enforcement officers and com-
munities that work together to address pub-
lic safety concerns can create lasting solu-
tions to difficult challenges; 
Whereas recent events have sparked a na-
tionwide call to improve the interactions be-
tween law enforcement officers and the com-
munities they serve, particularly commu-
nities of color; 
Whereas community policing facilitates 
peaceful dialogue, capable of fostering under-
standing and trust, between law enforcement 
officers and civilians; 
Whereas community policing can help im-
prove the equal enforcement of the laws; 
Whereas community policing informs the 
public about the challenges that law enforce-
ment officers face in executing their duties 
and provides law enforcement officers in-
sight into the concerns of community mem-
bers; 
Whereas a long-term commitment to com-
munity policing is necessary to eliminate 
the underlying causes of crime; 
Whereas the advancement of community 
policing should be supported to ensure that 
State and local law enforcement agencies 
have necessary resources; and 
Whereas community policing has been rec-

PROCE-
DURES TO ENSURE ADEQUATE 
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST COVID–19 
IN SENATE BUILDINGS 
Mr. KAINE (for Mr. SCHUMER
(for 
himself and Ms. KLOBUCHAR)) sub-
mitted the following concurrent resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Rules and Administration: 
S. CON. RES. 49 
Whereas on March 13, 2020, the COVID–19 
outbreak in the United States was declared a 
national emergency under the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.); 
Whereas as of August 7, 2020, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention has— 
(1) recommended ‘‘that people wear masks 
in public settings and when around people 
who don’t live in [their] household, espe-
cially when other social distancing measures 
are difficult to maintain.’’; and 
(2) stated that ‘‘masks may help prevent 
people who have COVID–19 from spreading 
the virus to others’’ and ‘‘masks are most 
likely to reduce the spread of COVID–19 
when they are widely used by people in pub-
lic settings.’’; 
Whereas as of October 5, 2020, nearly 
7,500,000 people in the United States had con-
tracted COVID–19, and nearly 210,000 people 
in the United States have died as a result of 
COVID–19; 
Whereas the United States accounts for ap-
proximately 4.25 percent of the world’s popu-
lation but, as of October 5, 2020, people in the 
United States account for over 20 percent of 
those killed by COVID–19 globally; and 
Whereas the Senate has seen an increase in 
the number of Senators diagnosed with 
COVID–19: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), 
SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) it is essential to the continuity of gov-
ernment that the United States Government 
and officials adhere to public health guid-
ance in order to combat the spread of 
COVID–19; and 
(2) the absence of a coordinated and com-
prehensive COVID–19 strategy in the Senate 
is a threat to the legislative branch. 
SEC. 2. PROCEDURES FOR COVID–19 PROTEC-
TION. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section— 
(1) the term ‘‘Senate building’’ means any 
Senate Office Building or the Senate Wing of 
the Capitol; and 
(2) the term ‘‘Senate worker’’ means— 
(A) an employee whose pay is disbursed by 
the Secretary of the Senate; or 
(B) an employee of a contractor of an office 
or agency in the legislative branch whose 
regular duty station is in a Senate building. 
(b) MASK USE.—All individuals shall wear a 
mask while in any public area of a Senate
