ENSURING A STRONG NATIONAL 
DEFENSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, 
just a few days before Christmas, on 
December 21, President Joe Biden 
issued a Presidential determination 
with little fanfare under the Defense 
Production Act of 1950. 
The Defense Production Act of 1950 is 
a Korean war-era law that allows the 
government to accelerate production of 
critical materials and technology. It is 
the same law that Presidents Trump 
and Biden used to stimulate production 
of COVID-related ventilators and PPE 
during the pandemic. 
In his memorandum to the Secretary 
of Defense, Biden noted that: ‘‘Ensur-
ing a robust, resilient, and competitive 
domestic defense industrial base that 
has the . . . workforce to meet the Vir-
ginia-class 
submarine 
undersea 
warfighting mission is essential to our 
national security.’’ 
To accomplish that mission, the 
President invoked DPA authorities to 
expand the domestic production capa-
bility for ‘‘large-scale fabrication, ship-
building industrial base expansion for 
resilience and robustness, and mari-
time workforce training pipelines.’’ 
As chair of the House Seapower and 
Projection 
Forces 
Subcommittee, 
which oversees the Virginia-class pro-
gram, I strongly support the Presi-
dent’s decision because it is based on 
both strategic national defense consid-
erations and industrial base demand. 
Indeed, just a few days after Christ-
mas, the President signed into law the 
2022 National Defense Authorization 
Act, which contained provisions my 
subcommittee authored that are com-
pletely aligned with the President’s 
DPA order. 
Specifically, the new 2022 NDAA 
added funding for new facility con-
struction for submarine production, as 
well as a boost for workforce training 
and supply chain development. All of 
these provisions were plus-ups from the 
Navy’s initial budget request last Feb-
ruary and based on our own analysis of 
strained shipyard capacity. 
The more consequential issue con-
tained in the DPA, I believe, is its find-
ing that the Virginia program ‘‘is es-
sential to our national security.’’ That 
finding is a blaring signal to the Con-
gress and the entire country that we 
need to bolster our undersea deterrent 
capability to counter aggressive, coer-
cive actions in the maritime domain— 
specifically, the behavior of both the 
Chinese and Russian navies that has 
been overwhelmingly repudiated by the 
United Nations Law of the Sea Conven-
tion, the former in the South China 
Sea in 2016 and the latter in the Black 
Sea in 2019. 
In both cases, despite the Inter-
national Court’s scathing rejection of 
both countries’ intrusions on protected 
waters, there is no sign that lawless-
ness has abated. China’s encroachment 
on territorial waters in the Philippines 
and Vietnam continues, as does its ille-
gal island building and militarization 
of artificial landmasses that the court 
condemned. In the Black Sea and the 
North Atlantic, Russian claims to sea 
control and its seizure of Ukrainian 
naval ships are blatantly in violation 
of the international rule of law. 
Madam Speaker, today, China has 
the world’s largest navy, and Putin is 
aggressively increasing the size of his 
submarine fleet. 
For the U.S. Navy, what is particu-
larly concerning is the development of 
sophisticated missile technology by 
both countries that increases the vul-
nerability of our surface fleet that has 
been working in conjunction with al-
lies like France, Japan, and Australia 
to reassert post-World War II principles 
of freedom of navigation visibly and 
peacefully. The joint sea patrols in the 
international waters of the Indo-Pa-
cific and Black Sea are a reassertion of 
principles that, since the end of World 
War II, have successfully reduced the 
risk of conflict while enhancing trade 
and prosperity. 
To counter ongoing threats to rule of 
law, the Biden administration has been 
diplomatically 
reconnecting, 
all 
throughout 2021, with U.S. allies in 
both regions, as well as reevaluating 
the highest and best use of limited de-
fense spending. The DPA issued on De-
cember 21 is a logical extension of that 
process. Given the new challenge posed

by missile technology to our surface 
ships, stepping up production of the 
Virginia-class program makes perfect 
sense since those submarines are not at 
risk from even the most sophisticated 
airborne missiles, and the Chinese and 
Russian navies know that. 
Madam Speaker, in addition, last 
September, the new AUKUS security 
alliance between the U.S., Australia, 
and the U.K., whose centerpiece is the 
sharing of nuclear propulsion tech-
nology for a new class of Australian 
submarines, is another powerful, tan-
gible statement about the importance 
of strengthening our joint allied under-
sea capability. 
As David Ignatius, a longtime ob-
server of U.S. foreign policy, recently 
wrote in The Washington Post: ‘‘The 
AUKUS alliance with Australia and 
Britain to build nuclear submarines 
and share other military technology 
might be the most important strategic 
move’’ by the U.S. ‘‘in decades.’’ 
The Biden DPA order last month and 
the AUKUS agreement last September 
are a powerful, tangible signal by the 
U.S. to our allies and friends who sup-
port a collaborative action to uphold 
international rule of law, which is crit-
ical to maintaining a peaceful coexist-
ence among the world’s nations. 
f 
COMBATING CHRONIC WASTING 
DISEASE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I am an avid out-
doorsman. In November and December, 
if I have time, I tend to spend it out in 
the woods, deer hunting. This is a pop-
ular passion among many Pennsylva-
nians as well as Americans across our 
great country. Nothing beats those 
early mornings heading out to the 
woods in hopes you will return success-
ful. 
But our deer are currently threat-
ened by chronic wasting disease. This 
is a contagious, neurological disease 
affecting deer, elk, and moose that is 
always fatal. CWD has been detected in 
25 States and was first discovered in 
Pennsylvania deer nearly 10 years ago. 
Working across the aisle, my col-
leagues and I introduced H.R. 5608, the 
Chronic Wasting Disease Research and 
Management Act, which unanimously 
passed out of the House Agriculture 
Committee. 
By 
working 
closely 
with 
stake-
holders, we developed a bill to take us 
one step closer to better understanding 
the genetic implications of the disease 
and developing policies best suited to 
solve the problem. 
Specifically, this legislation author-
izes $70 million to split evenly between 
CWD management and research efforts 
through 
USDA 
cooperative 
agree-
ments. 
The research funds are authorized to 
be spent on testing and detecting CWD 
in live cervids, noncervids, and the en-
vironment. Additionally, these funds 
are authorized for research of genetic 
resistance to chronic wasting disease, 
sustainable cervid harvest manage-
ment practices, and any additional fac-
tors of local CWD emergence. 
The management section authorizes 
funding for State or Tribal wildlife 
agencies and departments of agri-
culture based on various funding prior-
ities, including the highest incidences 
of CWD, areas demonstrating greatest 
financial commitments to addressing 
CWD, efforts to develop CWD programs 
and policies, areas of greatest risk of 
being introduced to CWD, and areas re-
sponding to new outbreaks. 
This bill also includes key education 
provisions in which USDA, State, and 
Tribal agencies are authorized to de-
velop materials to inform the public on 
chronic wasting disease. 
Last but certainly not least, H.R. 
5608 directs USDA reviewal of the herd 
certification 
program 
within 
18 
months. 
Madam Speaker, we need all hands 
on deck to help combat this disease, 
maintain a healthy deer population, 
and protect our beloved elk range—cer-
tainly, our elk range in Pennsylvania, 
which is near and dear to me. It is im-
perative we better understand the 
transmission of, resistance to, and di-
agnosis of CWD. 
I am really pleased that, in Decem-
ber, this House passed H.R. 5608 with 
strong bipartisan support, marking an 
important 
step 
in 
that 
direction. 
Today, we wait for the Senate to take 
up this time-sensitive bill. It is my be-
lief our colleagues in the Senate recog-
nize the urgency and the potential neg-
ative economic impacts of CWD if it 
continues to spread at this rate and 
work toward its passage. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LATE SARAH 
TYREE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the late Sarah 
Tyree, a passionate advocate who spent 
her career fighting for farmers, advo-
cating for rural and urban agriculture, 
and working to end hunger. 
Sarah dedicated herself to ending 
hunger and spent her life working on 
issues like promoting nutrition and re-
forming our food system to make eat-
ing locally grown foods more accessible 
to everyone. 
After starting her career on Capitol 
Hill, 
Sarah 
worked 
for 
the 
Bio-
technology Industry Organization and 
then the Missouri State Department of 
Agriculture, helping to establish the 
Missouri 
Conservation 
Reserve 
En-
hancement Program. 
Sarah served as vice president of the 
agricultural consulting firm AgriLogic, 
and then spent the last 15 years of her 
career at the financial cooperative 
CoBank here in Washington, D.C., 
where she most recently served as vice 
president for policy and public affairs. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
impact 
of 
Sarah’s commitment to agriculture 
and local farming cannot be under-
stated. She established a partnership 
between CoBank and the D.C. Central 
Kitchen, which allowed for the kitchen 
to significantly expand their local pur-
chasing power. Her efforts helped many 
farmers keep land that they may have 
otherwise lost due to the pandemic. 
Sarah was a devoted member of the 
D.C. Central Kitchen board of directors 
for many years, and she served as chair 
of the board between 2013 and 2018. In 
this capacity, Sarah continued her 
amazing work to end hunger and 
played a major role in securing funding 
to establish D.C. Central Kitchen’s new 
location and expand its reach. 
Sarah was unbelievably generous in 
her support of a cause that was dear to 
me, Monte Belmonte’s annual march 
across Western Massachusetts to end 
hunger and to help support the Food 
Bank of Western Massachusetts. She 
poured her energy into supporting local 
and national efforts to end hunger 
while also empowering the next genera-
tion of leaders in combating hunger 
through her work as a board chairman 
of the Campus Kitchens Project. 
Sarah never stopped imagining a big-
ger and brighter future. She believed in 
harnessing the power of community to 
make America the best that we can be, 
promoting nutrition, supporting local 
farmers, and fighting to end hunger 
along the way. Sarah approached her 
work and this life with an open heart 
and a genuine desire to do good. She 
cared about improving the lives of oth-
ers in a touching and rare way and has 
left an immeasurable impact on this 
world. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 
United States Congress, and all those 
whom Sarah’s light touched, it is my 
great privilege and honor to celebrate 
and recognize the wonderful life of the 
late Sarah Tyree. 
I want to say that I think I speak for 
all of my colleagues in this Chamber 
when I extend our condolences to her 
husband and her family. I hope that 
they all get comfort out of the fact 
that Sarah made such a difference for 
so many in this country and around the 
world.

NEW FUNDING FOR SEPTA FROM 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENT 
AND JOBS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. SCANLON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, last 
Friday was a big day for infrastructure 
in the Philadelphia region. 
Transportation 
Secretary 
Pete 
Buttigieg was in Philly to announce 
the first tranche of funding for bridges 
under the new law, including $1.6 bil-
lion for Pennsylvania bridges.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H201 
January 18, 2022 
That afternoon, I got to highlight 
how funding from the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act will improve 
our regional public transit system, 
known as SEPTA. 
Over the next 5 years, SEPTA will re-
ceive more than $500 million more than 
expected. That money will help SEPTA 
accelerate repair efforts, including re-
habilitation projects, vehicle replace-
ment, and improving accessibility of 
rail and trolley stations. 
While all of these upgrades are need-
ed, the forthcoming work on accessi-
bility is especially important. In fact, 
it is essential. People across our region 
rely on SEPTA every day to get to 
work, take their kids to school, buy 
groceries, go to the doctor, and more. 
Our neighbors should be able to com-
plete these daily tasks without having 
to plan around which station has an el-
evator to accommodate a wheelchair or 
which stop is easier to get a baby 
stroller in and out of. 
I am glad the infrastructure funding 
that Congress and President Biden de-
livered will help get this much-needed 
work done more quickly. Our Delaware 
Valley residents deserve it.

ELECTION WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise because we have seen a continuous 
assault on voting rights and election 
integrity in recent years, pushed by 
partisan operatives, foreign govern-
ments and, most disturbingly, some of 
our own elected officials. 
Over the weekend, the former Presi-
dent pressed members of his party in 
Pennsylvania to plant more Republican 
operatives in our election system in 
order to influence the counting of 
votes. 
The former President said, ‘‘We have 
to be a lot sharper the next time when 
it comes to counting the vote. Some-
times the vote counter is more impor-
tant than the candidate.’’ That is just 
wrong. 
I will be the first to agree that our 
election workers are essential, but not 
because they are supposed to change 
the results in our elections for one po-
litical party or another. That is not 
how American elections work. Here, 
the people decide. 
This kind of mindset is exactly why 
it is so important to have people of 
good character trained and ready to 
execute the duties of poll workers 
faithfully. Poll workers are the first 
line of defense for ensuring the right to 
vote. They help voters overcome chal-
lenges, both bureaucratic and physical, 
at the polls. They also help educate the 
public about how safe and effective our 
election system really is. 
We need more engaged citizens who 
want to contribute to our democracy 
to get involved and sign up to be poll 
workers in our communities. I encour-
age my constituents to reach out to 
their county election officials today to 
learn more about this unique oppor-
tunity to uphold our democratic sys-
tem and help ensure that all eligible 
voters are able to exercise their most 
essential freedom, the right to vote. 
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW DELIVERS 
BENEFITS 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, one 
of the highlights of congressional ac-
tion last year was the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, and we are 
already seeing the impact in my dis-
trict, 
Pennsylvania’s 
5th, 
and 
the 
greater Philadelphia region. 
Just before the holidays, EPA Ad-
ministrator Regan joined me at the 
Lower Darby Creek Area Superfund 
Site to announce that the agency had 
committed millions in funding from 
that infrastructure bill to this project, 
moving its anticipated completion date 
up to 2023. 
At this former landfill, chemicals 
had leached into the soil and ground-
water for decades in the largely minor-
ity community of Eastwick. Thanks to 
funding from the new infrastructure 
package, many sites like Lower Darby 
Creek will see their cleanup acceler-
ated, and nearly 50 additional Super-
fund sites will get the green light to be 
cleaned up. 
Less pollution, safer communities, 
and more jobs. 
I am proud to deliver these benefits 
to PA–05 through the bipartisan infra-
structure law.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
All-knowing, all-seeing God, look 
upon us this day. Nothing is hidden 
from Your sight. All that we are is laid 
bare before You. 
Peer into our innermost thoughts 
and redeem the unworthiness therein 
that attempts to define us. Search our 
souls and give comfort to the dis-
content that threatens to overwhelm 
us. 
In Your mercy, see us as we are 
meant to be and give us the light of 
Your countenance to live into that 
hope. 
Then, as we have been seen, may we 
see. As we gaze around us, help us to 
look upon the people You have placed 
in our paths with the same acceptance 
that You have shown us. 
Give us Your sight, that we would 
not be the judge of unworthiness, but 
the agents of Your redemption. Give us 
eyes to see the discontented, that we 
would be instruments of Your comfort 
and gracious care, with a selfless ges-
ture, a kind word, a helping hand. 
Reveal all around us who seek to re-
main invisible or who have, by our in-
difference, remained hidden, that no 
one would have cause to believe that 
they remain outside Your grace and 
mercy. 
In Your omniscient name we pray. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H202 
January 18, 2022 
Jim was born and raised in DuBois, 
Pennsylvania. He worked for two dec-
ades as a registered professional engi-
neer with the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Transportation in various posi-
tions, including district and regional 
soils engineer, chief field materials 
control engineer, chief of the Materials 
and Testing Division, and director of 
highway maintenance. 
His work in the pavement preserva-
tion industry has transcended his pro-
fessional role at PennDOT, Koch Mate-
rials, and as executive director at FP2, 
Incorporated. He has also furthered 
transportation policy as chairman of 
the Transportation Research Board’s 
Committee on Pavement Maintenance 
and on the Executive Committee of 
Road and Paving Materials. 
Mr. Moulthrop has spent his career 
encouraging comprehensive pavement 
preservation practices as not only a 
cost-effective approach to maintaining 
and 
preserving 
our 
roads, 
which 
stretches the Federal budget, but also 
because they benefit drivers each and 
every day by improving the quality and 
safety of our roads. 
Madam Speaker, I will conclude by 
recognizing 
the 
impact 
Mr. 
Moulthrop’s career has had in increas-
ing the awareness of the value and im-
portance of pavement preservation in 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
and States nationwide.

TYLER LINDERBAUM DOMINATES 
ON AND OFF THE FIELD 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize an 
outstanding student, athlete, and lead-
er from my district. 
Tyler Linderbaum of Solon, Iowa, not 
only creates a huge impact on the foot-
ball field as the starting center for the 
Iowa Hawkeyes, but he also creates a 
huge impact in our community. 
This season, Tyler used the new 
NCAA rules to hold a fundraiser for our 
beloved University of Iowa Stead Fam-
ily Children’s Hospital. After setting 
up a website to sell merchandise, he 
presented the Children’s Hospital with 
a check for $30,000. 
On the football field, Tyler was domi-
nant. In addition to leading the Hawks 
to 10 wins, Tyler was named the first 
team 
All-American, 
and 
was 
also 
awarded the Rimington Award as col-
lege football’s best center. For his 
work, Pro Football Focus graded him 
with their highest grade ever given to 
a college football center. 
Thank you, Tyler, for being an out-
standing citizen of our community. I 
am looking forward to watching you 
continue to dominate in the NFL and 
make our State and our world a better 
place. Go, Hawks.

SUPPORT LIFE 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, former 
President Ronald Reagan once said: 
‘‘America was founded on the moral 
proposition 
that 
human 
life—all 
human life—is sacred. And this propo-
sition is the bedrock of our national 
life, the foundation of our laws. It is 
the wellspring of our Constitution.’’ 
If our Nation can unite around any 
singular issue, it should be that life is 
sacred, especially the life of a child. 
This week, tens of thousands of 
Americans will coalesce around that 
issue as they visit our Nation’s Capital 
for the purpose of protecting life. 
I join with these peaceful Americans 
in supporting laws that ensure every 
child has the opportunity for the most 
basic right defined in our Constitution, 
the right to life. 
As a member of the Pro-Life Caucus 
and a father of two wonderful boys, I 
want to welcome all these great Ameri-
cans as they visit Washington, D.C., to 
help defend the life of the unborn.

HONORING THE HEROES OF 
COLLEYVILLE, TEXAS 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor America’s heroes as 
they protected the faithful members of 
Texas-24 in their place of worship over 
the weekend. We witnessed a terrorist 
threat in our community, as he held 
four worshippers hostage in the Con-
gregation Beth Israel synagogue in 
Colleyville, Texas. 
The brave men and women of our 
community selflessly rose to show our 
neighbors and our country that we will 
always stand together in unity to sup-
port each other. We proved this as the 
Colleyville 
Police 
Department 
re-
sponded immediately to the threat. 
Local churches showed their support as 
Good Shepherd Catholic Community 
Church opened its doors to take in the 
evacuees and families of hostages until 
the situation was resolved. Pleasant 
Run Baptist Church also opened its 
doors for others and displayed prayer 
signs for their ‘‘brothers and sisters at 
Beth Israel.’’ 
We are grateful for everyone who 
stepped up to serve their neighbors, 
and commend the resilience of the four 
who were held hostage against their 
will, including Rabbi Charlie Cytron- 
Walker, whose courageous actions led 
to the safe escape of his fellow hos-
tages. 
As we await further details, we ask 
for your continued support and prayers 
for the Colleyville community and the 
Congregation Beth Israel synagogue.

SUPPLEMENTAL IMPACT AID 
FLEXIBILITY ACT 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I move to suspend the rules and pass 
the bill (S. 2959) to provide that, due to 
the disruptions caused by COVID–19, 
applications for impact aid funding for 
fiscal year 2023 may use certain data 
submitted in the fiscal year 2022 appli-
cation. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 2959 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Supple-
mental Impact Aid Flexibility Act’’. 
SEC. 2. IMPACT AID PROGRAM. 
Due to the public health emergency di-
rectly relating to COVID–19 and notwith-
standing sections 7002(j) and 7003(c) of the El-
ementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 7702(j), 7703(c)), a local edu-
cational agency desiring to receive a pay-
ment under section 7002 or 7003 of such Act 
(20 U.S.C. 7702, 7703) for fiscal year 2023 that 
also submitted an application for such pay-
ment for fiscal year 2022 shall, in the applica-
tion submitted under section 7005 of such Act 
(20 U.S.C. 7705) for fiscal year 2023— 
(1) with respect to a requested payment 
under section 7002 of such Act— 
(A) use the data described in section 7002(j) 
of such Act relating to calculating such pay-
ment that was submitted by the local edu-
cational agency in the application for fiscal 
year 2022; or 
(B) use the data relating to calculating 
such payment for the fiscal year required 
under section 7002(j) of such Act; and 
(2) with respect to a requested payment 
under section 7003 of such Act— 
(A) use the student count data relating to 
calculating such payment that was sub-
mitted by the local educational agency in 
the application for fiscal year 2022, provided 
that payments for fiscal year 2023 shall be 
calculated by the Secretary using the ex-
penditures and rates described in clauses (i), 
(ii), (iii), and (iv) of section 7003(b)(1)(C) of 
such Act that would otherwise apply for fis-
cal year 2023; or 
(B) use the student count data relating to 
calculating such payment for the fiscal year 
required under section 7003(c) of such Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) and the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Virginia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on S. 2959. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Virginia? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge 
Members to support the Supplemental 
Impact Aid Flexibility Act introduced 
by Senator SMITH from Minnesota and 
Senator THUNE
from South Dakota. 
The companion bill was introduced by 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
COURTNEY) and the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON). 
It is difficult to overstate the impor-
tance of Impact Aid for our Nation’s 
children. For over 70 years, this pro-
gram has been critical to ensuring that 
schools that serve children connected 
to Federal lands have the resources to 
help their students thrive. 
Unlike most public schools in Amer-
ica, these schools do not receive fund-
ing from property taxes from these 
Federal assets. This means that with-
out Impact Aid support, because they 
still have to educate the children at-
tached to those assets, this means that 
without Impact Aid schools serving the 
children connected to military bases, 
affordable housing units, or Native 
Americans on reservations and many 
other institutions would be signifi-
cantly shortchanged, and therefore, un-
able to offer high-quality education. 
The need for this program is now 
greater than ever as our school com-
munities grapple with a resurgence of 
COVID–19. 
In response, Democrats and Repub-
licans worked together in the last Con-
gress led by, again, the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) and the 
gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. 
JOHNSON) to enact the Impact Aid 
Coronavirus Relief Act. That bill en-
sured that during the pandemic schools 
continued to have access to Impact Aid 
funding that accurately reflected their 
student populations, whether or not 
those students could accurately be 
counted as physically in those schools 
because of the complications created 
by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Today, we have the responsibility to, 
once again, join together in providing 
schools the support and flexibility they 
need to serve their students. 
The Supplemental Impact Aid Flexi-
bility Act will go a long way toward 
ensuring that all students in this coun-
try, no matter where they go to school, 
will have access to high-quality edu-
cation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 2959, the Supplemental Impact 
Aid Flexibility Act. This bill would 
allow school districts participating in 
the Impact Aid program to use pre-
viously reported student headcounts on 
their Impact Aid applications for the 
2022–2023 school year. 
Impact Aid supplements funding for 
schools and students in areas that col-
lect less in local property taxes due to 
the Federal Government’s presence. 
School districts that receive Impact 
Aid payments include those with mili-
tary bases, Indian reservations, and 
Federal low-income housing in or near 
the school district. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has taken a 
big toll on school districts and commu-
nities across the country. It is espe-
cially difficult for federally impacted 
school 
districts 
to 
calculate 
headcounts due to fluctuations during 
the pandemic. 
Headcounts determine how much aid 
more than 1,000 federally impacted 
school districts receive. That aid helps 
pay for staff salaries, bussing, tech-
nology, and other educational supports 
and services for students. This bill en-
sures the Impact Aid recipients will 
not be affected negatively by the pan-
demic and temporary falling enroll-
ment that have resulted. This frees up 
valuable time and resources to help 
students, while schools maintain a reli-
able source of funding as they address 
the academic, social, emotional, and 
safety needs of the students. 
This bill will have no impact on gov-
ernment spending because Impact Aid 
is a discretionary program, and its 
funding level is established through the 
annual appropriations process. 
The trade association for Impact Aid 
school districts, the National Associa-
tion for Federally Impacted Schools, is 
strongly supportive of this bill. 
This bill is similar to the one signed 
into law by President Trump on De-
cember 4, 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support S. 2959, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. 
COURTNEY), the sponsor of the House 
version of the bill. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the bipartisan Im-
pact Aid Flexibility Act, S. 2959, which 
is a companion bill to H. 6126, which I 
introduced on December 2, 2021. I thank 
Chairman SCOTT and Ranking Member 
FOXX, 
and 
her 
representative 
this 
evening, Mr. OWENS, of the Education 
and Labor Committee, and the com-
mittee staff for accelerating consider-
ation of this important measure which 
provides Federal support to 11 million 
K–12 schoolchildren across America, 
and whose passage is very time sen-
sitive, which I will explain in a minute. 
Mr. Speaker, Federal Impact Aid is 
our Nation’s oldest K–12 Federal edu-
cation program. Impact Aid has its ori-
gins in 1821 when Congress first author-
ized support for schools to educate 
military dependent children. 
In 1934, Congress passed the Johnson- 
O’Malley Act, which extended help to 
school districts located at federally 
recognized Tribal lands. Congress rec-
ognized that, like military school dis-
tricts, kids residing on Native Amer-
ican Tribal lands, which were not sub-
ject to State or local taxation to fund 
schools, deserved assistance.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H204 
January 18, 2022 
In 1950, President Harry Truman 
signed into law the statutory frame-
work for Impact Aid which still stands 
today. Impact Aid is an important 
statement to communities that host 
children who reside in and are con-
nected to Federal property and facili-
ties, namely, that the Nation will not 
force them to bear an unfair dispropor-
tionate cost to public education. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent 
a district with two of those host com-
munities, Groton and Ledyard, Con-
necticut. Groton is the home to our 
Nation’s oldest Navy submarine base 
with approximately 9,000 sailors and of-
ficers who work every day to protect 
our Nation. Ledyard is the town next 
door where many personnel live. Grot-
on has over 1,000 Navy kids, and 
Ledyard has 850. Ledyard is also the 
site of the Mashantucket Tribal Na-
tion, many of whose children attend 
Ledyard schools. Impact Aid is critical 
to these towns’ school budgets. 
The bill before us addresses an urgent 
logistical problem with Impact Aid, 
that, unless we act, will harm military 
and Tribal districts all across the coun-
try, namely, the obstacle created by 
COVID, to get an accurate headcount 
of eligible students that must be filed 
with the U.S. Department of Education 
by January 31, 12 days from now. And 
that, again, is the time-sensitive ur-
gency this evening. Military and Tribal 
districts across the country have re-
ported that COVID restrictions have 
slowed down the paperwork process, 
and this hindrance will result in an 
undercount, and thus, an artificially 
low Federal reimbursement. 
The Impact Aid Flexibility Act will 
solve this problem in an elegant way 
by simply carrying over last year’s stu-
dent census, thus ensuring no Impact 
Aid district will be harmed financially. 
This is a 1-year fix, the same as the fix 
the last Congress passed in December 
2020, the Impact Aid Coronavirus Relief 
Act, which I sponsored with my Repub-
lican colleague, DUSTY
JOHNSON
of 
South Dakota. 
Mr. Speaker, this vote is being 
watched nervously by school officials 
and military staff all across the Na-
tion, such as Groton school super-
intendent, Susan Austin, Ledyard su-
perintendent, Jason Hartling, and Mi-
randa Chapman, the Navy School liai-
son officer at the Groton SUBASE, 
New London, who have worked with 
the National Association of Federally 
Impacted Schools, and I salute them 
and all their colleagues across the 
country for their work raising this 
issue before Congress. 
The bill before us has already passed 
the U.S. Senate unanimously and has 
the support of the Biden administra-
tion. It is a bill that keeps the promise 
to host communities that a high-qual-
ity education will not be denied be-
cause of military service or Tribal rec-
ognition. 
I urge the House to pass this bill to-
night with an overwhelming vote of 
confidence and thanks for those who 
wear the uniform of this country and 
our Tribal nations and their families. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, the Impact 
Aid program represents the Federal 
Government’s 
promise 
to 
provide 
school districts with additional assist-
ance when property taxes are lower be-
cause of the presence of military, Fed-
eral, or Tribal lands. 
Every year, affected school districts 
take count of the federally connected 
students through a take-home survey. 
This headcount determines the dis-
trict’s 
Impact 
Aid 
reimbursement, 
which can help pay for teacher salaries, 
technology, and student support serv-
ices. 
Throughout the pandemic, school 
systems across the Nation have worked 
through many challenges to continue 
serving students. Conducting these Im-
pact Aid surveys have been no dif-
ferent. 
That is why the Supplemental Im-
pact Aid Flexibility Act will allow 
school districts to reuse their FY22 
student counts and property tax data 
when submitting their upcoming FY23 
applications at the end of January. 
This additional reporting flexibility 
will be helpful to many of the 1,100 fed-
erally impacted school districts, in-
cluding Richmond County schools in 
my district, which serves the great 
community of Fort Gordon and our 
great base there, a U.S. Army installa-
tion. 
I am proud to support the Supple-
mental Impact Aid Flexibility Act. I 
believe that it will provide much-need-
ed assurance for school systems. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON). 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank Mr. OWENS for yield-
ing and for his leadership on this issue. 
I rise today in support of the Supple-
mental Impact Aid Flexibility Act. The 
pandemic has had a dramatic impact 
on our school systems and the way stu-
dents are learning, both in and out of 
the classroom. Many parents have 
made the decision to homeschool their 
children due to uncertainty around 
vaccine and mask mandates in schools. 
With many resources of local edu-
cational agencies dedicated to fighting 
the pandemic, it has also become a bur-
den on them to maintain an accurate 
count of federally connected students. 
I am grateful for the bipartisan lead-
ership today of Chairman SCOTT and 
Ranking Member FOXX, who support 
this 
legislation. 
This 
bill 
takes 
proactive measures to ensuring that 
teachers and students are adequately 
supported when returning to the class-
room. By allowing local educational 
agencies to use the same number of 
federally connected students that they 
enrolled on their fiscal year ’22 applica-
tions as they do fiscal year ’23 applica-
tions, we can allow them to focus on 
recovering from the pandemic and 
serve the children of our United States 
servicemembers adequately. 
As a representative of Fort Jackson 
in Columbia, South Carolina, and also 
nearby Fort Jackson in Georgia, ably 
represented 
by 
Congressman 
RICK 
ALLEN, we have multiple beneficiaries 
of Impact Aid funding. I am grateful to 
support this legislation and encourage 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. OWENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
The Supplemental Impact Aid Flexi-
bility Act ensures that students and 
schools relying on Impact Aid will not 
be affected negatively by the pan-
demic. 
Specifically, the bill allows schools 
to 
use 
their 
previously 
reported 
headcounts so that services students 
rely on will continue. This frees up ad-
ministrators to use their valuable time 
and 
resources 
addressing 
the 
edu-
cational needs of the students. 
Students in over 1,000 federally im-
pacted districts deserve the resources 
they receive from the Impact Aid pro-
gram. This aid helps pay for a wide 
range of services that students rely on 
from bussing and technology to edu-
cational support services. 
I encourage my colleagues to support 
S. 2959, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
b 1800 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, 
Congress has taken historic steps to 
help schools recover from the pandemic 
because we know that every school and 
every student and every family has felt 
the tragic effects of COVID–19. 
However, we cannot fully achieve 
that goal if we fail to address the 
unique challenges facing schools that 
serve students connected with military 
bases, 
affordable 
housing, 
Native 
American reservations, and other Fed-
eral properties. 
Last Congress, Democrats and Re-
publicans came together and, as a Na-
tion, tackled the first strain of COVID– 
19. We came together to address these 
challenges and to provide urgent sup-
port for Impact Aid schools. 
Now, as we confront a new COVID 
threat, we must provide the support 
that federally connected children need 
under the Federal Impact Aid program. 
By providing the support and flexi-
bility in this legislation, we will help 
ensure that Impact Aid schools can 
keep their teachers and staff on the 
payroll, purchase textbooks and learn-
ing supplies, and keep the lights on in 
their classrooms. And this bill will help 
ensure that hundreds of thousands of 
students have access to a quality edu-
cation. 
Again, I thank the Senator from Min-
nesota (Ms. SMITH) and the Senator 
from South Dakota (Mr. THUNE), as 
well as, in the House, the gentleman 
from Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) and

The SPEAKER. Without objection, 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DIAZ- 
BALART) is recognized for 1 minute. 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, 
as the dean of the Florida delegation, I 
have the honor of welcoming Rep-
resentative SHEILA CHERFILUS-MCCOR-
MICK of Florida’s 20th District to the 
United States House of Representa-
tives. 
Our new colleague will fill the seat of 
my late dear friend, Alcee Hastings. 
Now, similar to the district that I am 
honored to represent, Florida’s 20th 
District is extremely diverse and cov-
ers urban and agricultural areas in 
both Palm Beach and Broward Coun-
ties. 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK
is the 
proud daughter of Haitian immigrants, 
and she was born in Brooklyn, New 
York. 
Madam Speaker, after finishing col-
lege at Howard University, she moved 
to Florida to attend St. Thomas Uni-
versity School of Law. 
Although she left Florida to become 
a project manager at the New York 
City Transit Authority, it wasn’t long 
before Florida’s sunshine brought her 
back to Florida. In 1999, she joined 
Trinity Health Care Services and even-
tually became the company’s CEO. 
Madam Speaker, this once single 
mother is the epitome of the American 
Dream and represents the aspiration of 
so many of our South Florida neigh-
bors. I look forward, Madam Speaker, 
to working with our newest colleague 
on the issues of importance to our 
country and to South Florida. Flor-
ida’s congressional delegation is hon-
ored 
to 
welcome 
Congresswoman 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK
to the United 
States House of Representatives. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK), 
who 
is 
our 
newest Member of Congress. 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. DIAZ- 
BALART for those kinds words and in-
troduction. 
I would first like to thank my fam-
ily: my husband, Corlie McCormick, 
my daughter, Ismanie McCormick, and 
son, Jackson McCormick, who are in 
the gallery. 
I would like to thank my team and 
my family, and especially God, who has 
brought us this far. 
I am a child of immigrant parents 
who risked their lives to come to the 
United States. I thank my colleagues 
who fought for me even before I was 
born here to ensure that immigrants 
can actually have a place in our coun-
try and can live the American Dream. 
So I thank Members in advance be-
cause that is how I got here. 
I also want to thank the 20th District 
who fought with us and who believed in 
a new voice and is giving this little 
Haitian-American girl a chance to 
fight for our country. 
I would like to say a special thank 
you for all the pastors who prayed. I 
pledge to work as hard as I can, tire-
lessly, to ensure that District 20 and 
the United States are getting their 
needs met. I pledge to work as hard as

Congresswoman Barbara Rose-Collins, 
Michigan’s first African-American Con-
gresswoman. She was a trailblazer who 
inspired many women to seek public of-
fice. 
Congresswoman Rose-Collins got her 
start in public service as a member of 
the Detroit public school board. She 
served as a Michigan State legislator 
and a Detroit City Council member be-
fore being elected to the United States 
Congress in 1990. 
During her tenure in the U.S. Con-
gress, Congresswoman Rose-Collins ad-
vocated for food and agriculture poli-
cies to assist communities with food 
insecurity. 
She was a fierce defender of human 
rights in Detroit, across the country, 
and abroad. She dedicated her career to 
making our community stronger and 
our country better. 
Please join me in recognition of Con-
gresswoman 
Barbara 
Rose-Collins’ 
many years of dedicated public service 
as we honor her memory.

HONORING JONATHAN MARQUESS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and 
honor Jonathan Marquess on his ap-
pointment as the Georgia Pharmacy 
Association vice president of the Acad-
emy of Independent Pharmacy. 
A graduate of Mercer University in 
Macon, Georgia, Jonathan has enjoyed 
a distinguished career and is well de-
serving of this appointment. 
He is currently the president and 
CEO of the Institute for Wellness and 
Education in Woodstock, Georgia, and 
owns many pharmacies across the 
State. In addition to owning and man-
aging many pharmacies, Jonathan has 
served as president of the Georgia 
Pharmacy Association and vice presi-
dent of professional and clinical affairs 
for the American Pharmacy Coopera-
tive. Jonathan has served as the third, 
fourth, and fifth vice president for the 
National Community Pharmacists As-
sociation since 2017. 
Jonathan has dedicated his career 
not only to bettering his patients but 
also working to improve the lives and 
practices of pharmacists nationwide as 
well. 
His 
illustrious 
career 
of 
service 
makes him more than suited to fit this 
role, and we are excited to see what 
else he can accomplish. 
f 
REMEMBERING DR. MARTIN 
LUTHER KING, JR. 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday was the Federal holiday hon-
oring Dr. Martin Luther King, and I ac-
cepted the challenge of the Martin Lu-
ther King family, under the name of 
Martin Luther King III, his oldest 
child: No celebration without legisla-
tion. 
So I rise in the middle of the debate 
and debacle that is going on over an ill- 
fated and wrong policy of the filibuster 
and cloture to read the words of Dr. 
Martin Luther King that he issued on 
April 3, 1968, speaking about having 
been stabbed by a demented woman 
and saying that if he had only sneezed, 
he might not have been there even in 
1968. 
And so he says: ‘‘And I want to say 
tonight, I want to say that I am happy 
that I didn’t sneeze. Because if I had 
sneezed, I wouldn’t have been around 
here in 1960 when students all over the 
South started sitting in at lunch 
counters. And I knew that as they were 
sitting in, they were really standing up 
for the best in the American Dream 
and taking the whole Nation back to 
those great wells of democracy which 
were dug deep by the Founding Fathers 
in the Declaration of Independence and 
the Constitution. If I had sneezed, I 
wouldn’t have been around in 1962 when 
Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to 
straighten their backs up. And when-
ever men and women straighten their 
backs up, they are going somewhere be-
cause a man can’t ride your back un-
less it is bent. If I had sneezed, I 
wouldn’t have been here in 1963 when 
the Black people of Birmingham, Ala-
bama, aroused the conscience of this 
Nation.’’ 
Finally, I want to say that he wanted 
to make sure that his life was not in 
vain and that he would be recognized 
and remembered for the work that he 
had done.

b 1915 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S YEAR OF 
CRISES 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I saw a 
political crossword puzzle this week. It 
asked for a six-letter word to describe 
President Biden’s first year in office. 
So I thought, divisive? No, that is eight 
letters. Weak? No, that is four letters. 
But the word is crises, Madam Speak-
er. From the crisis raging at our south-
ern border to the economic crisis af-
fecting Arkansans, small businesses, 
and Americans across the Nation, the 
Biden administration has continually 
failed to address these challenges head- 
on. 
The border crisis isn’t a seasonal 
problem, as argued. It is the direct re-
sult of repealing the Trump-era border 
policies and replacing them with abso-
lutely nothing until recently. 
Federal Reserve Chair Powell says, 
inflation 
isn’t 
transitory, 
Madam 
Speaker. It continues to rise to a 40- 
year high. Americans are paying more 
for just about everything from gas to 
groceries. 
Under President Trump, we saw in-
creasing real wages. Under President 
Biden, we are seeing real wages de-
cline, meaning our pay is decreasing 
when accounting for inflation. 
Democrats’ solution? Continuing to 
push their constant tax-and-spending 
spree. We need leadership, Madam 
Speaker. 
f 
5G SERVICES MUST BE DELAYED 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to express the serious concern that our 
aviation community has regarding the 
rollout of 5G service. The Federal Avia-
tion Administration has warned that 
potential 5G interference could affect 
sensitive airplane instruments, such as 
radar altimeters, which would signifi-
cantly 
hamper 
low-visibility 
oper-
ations, and so we must delay the roll-
out of 5G at select airports until we 
can address all aviation safety con-
cerns. 
Pilots across America are flying in 
low-visibility conditions, from snow to 
sea fog to other zero-visibility condi-
tions, and they need all the instru-
ments and procedures at their disposal 
so that they can safely protect the 
lives of their passengers and crew. 
We cannot and must not compromise 
on safety. It will be safe to fly when pi-
lots say it is safe to fly. The United 
States has the safest air transportation 
system in the world, and we must con-
tinue to safeguard this system. 
I am thankful that wireless carriers 
have decided to delay the implementa-
tion at key airports, but that does not 
go far enough. The FAA needs to en-
sure that 5G services will not be imple-
mented at any of the 50 airport loca-
tions that have been identified as vul-
nerable until safety can be ensured. 
f 
TAYLORSVILLE TIMES’ 100TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, recently 
the Taylorsville Times, a historic 
newspaper in North Carolina’s Fifth 
District, celebrated its 100th anniver-
sary. 
I cannot overstate how much of an 
institution this newspaper is within 
the community. A century of produc-
tion is a testament to the value that 
this newspaper creates for its dedicated 
readers. Like clockwork, it continues 
to carry on in the Alexander County 
community. 
Congratulations to Lee Sharpe, the 
publisher of the Taylorsville Times, 
and his family for achieving this tre-
mendous accomplishment. Thanks to 
the diligence and hard work of Lee and 
his family, the citizens of Alexander 
County continue to have access to an 
invaluable resource.

Here is to another prosperous 100 
years of service. 
f 
CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF JOHN 
RICE IRWIN 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate the life of John Rice 
Irwin, a renowned historian and the 
founder of east Tennessee’s Museum of 
Appalachia. He recently passed away at 
91 years of age. 
John joined the U.S. Army and was 
stationed in Germany during the Ko-
rean war. When he returned to east 
Tennessee, he began a career in edu-
cation and became Anderson County 
Schools’ youngest superintendent at 
the age of 31. 
It was around this time John started 
collecting 
old-timey 
Appalachian 
items. John was fascinated by east 
Tennessee’s rich cultural history, and 
he traveled around the region to col-
lect artifacts and document stories of 
how the people lived long ago. He even 
bought a historic cabin and restored it 
to what it would have looked like when 
it was first built. 
Madam Speaker, that little cabin be-
came the Museum of Appalachia, which 
opened in 1969 and received around 600 
visitors during its first year. John kept 
expanding the museum, and now it cov-
ers 65 acres, contains over 250,000 his-
torical artifacts, and welcomes tens of 
thousands of guests each year. Anyone 
who visits the museum will recognize 
John’s passion for the Appalachian her-
itage. 
Former Tennessee Senator Lamar 
Alexander displayed loaned artifacts 
from John’s museum in his Washington 
office until his retirement in 2020. 
These same artifacts are now on dis-
play in my Washington office, and I am 
reminded of John’s incredible work 
each time I walk through the front 
door. 
Rest in peace, brother. Thank you for 
telling the stories of our historic Appa-
lachian community.

MILWAUKEE’S MURDER RATE 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. As 
a child, I was always so proud of Mil-
waukee. You would look at the crime 
records or the crime numbers in the 
biggest cities around the country, and 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, along with San 
Diego, year after year had the lowest 
murder rate in the country. 
It is, therefore, very disappointing to 
find out that at the end of last year 
Milwaukee, one more time, set their 
all-time record for murders, at 197. 
This is caused, I think, in no small part 
by politicians who scream racism and 
cause disrespect for the Milwaukee Po-
lice Department, and, therefore, the 
Milwaukee Police Department has to 
back off and not be aggressive, as Mil-
waukee continues to become more and 
more dangerous. 
I can only hope in the future that 
politicians looking to make cheap 
points do not further denigrate the 
Milwaukee police and do not further 
cause Milwaukee to hit another record 
this year in total murders.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
NEWMAN). The Chair would clarify the 
earlier announcement. Pursuant to 
clause 5(d) of rule XX, the whole num-
ber of the House is 434. 
f 
52 WEEKS OF BROKEN PROMISES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Indi-
ana (Mr. BANKS) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, today, 
at least on one question, Americans are 
more united than ever before. This 
week, as we mark the 1-year mark of 
the Biden Presidency, the vast major-
ity of the American people agree that 
the Biden Presidency has been a fail-
ure. 
After 1 year in office, President 
Biden’s approval rating is the lowest 
ever recorded after the first year in of-
fice of any President in American his-
tory. 
Why is no mystery. By every meas-
ure, Americans are worse off today 
than when Biden took office. Inflation, 
crime, the debt, the border, Afghani-
stan, a never-ending pandemic, Ameri-
cans have endured humiliation abroad 
and division at home, and all of these 
disasters are man-made. 
Everyone knows why inflation is at a 
40-year high. Everyone knows why 
Americans’ wages have been cut by 3 
percent or more. Democrats spent tril-
lions and then passed the largest Fed-
eral budget in history. 
How, in less than a year, did we go 
from energy independence to begging 
Saudi Arabia for oil? Well, maybe it 
has something to do with the President 
banning new natural gas production in 
the United States. 
You see, the media wants to make 
things complicated. They want you to 
believe that no one really knows why 
you are paying close to $4 per gallon at 
the pump. They want to separate the 
consequences of the last year from its 
cause. But don’t be fooled, Madam 
Speaker. 
There is a border crisis because the 
Biden administration stopped building 
the wall, cut deportations by 90 per-
cent, and reversed every single one of 
President Trump’s successful border 
enforcement measures. 
Fentanyl is now the leading cause of 
death for Americans aged 18 to 45 be-
cause it, too, is pouring across a wide- 
open southern border. It is that simple. 
Crime immediately shot up after 
Democrats’ antipolice riots, because of 
Democrats’ antipolice riots. 
There are still hundreds of Ameri-
cans stranded in Afghanistan because 
the 
Biden 
administration 
didn’t 
prioritize its own citizens for evacu-
ation. 
President Biden’s COVID policies do 
not work. That is why COVID cases, 
hospitalizations, and deaths all rose 
during the Biden Presidency. Ameri-
cans endured mandatory vaccinations, 
pointless 
mask 
mandates, 
endless 
school closures, and never-ending Dr. 
Fauci interviews. And it was all for 
nothing. 
Americans can see what is in front of 
them. That is why they have rejected 
this administration. The proof is in the 
pudding, and the pudding is stale. 
The question is, can Americans en-
dure 3 more years just like the last 
one? I believe that they can, but they 
shouldn’t have to. That is why the Re-
publican Study Committee is here to-
night. We will hold the Biden adminis-
tration accountable every step of the 
way. We will make sure that the past 
year of crises and catastrophes never 
repeats itself. 
Madam Speaker, tonight, I will yield 
to a number of my colleagues, like the 
next speaker. The gentlewoman from 
the 
great 
State 
of 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
WALORSKI) is going to share some 
thoughts with us. 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, 
the American people have faced 52 
weeks of broken promises. 
The President who promised to unite 
the American people instead has pitted 
citizens against one another. 
The President who promised to work 
with Americans across the political 
spectrum has prioritized a radical 
agenda that caters only to the extreme 
wing of his party. 
The President who promised to pro-
tect the American people has left us 
vulnerable at the southern border and 
across the world. 
The President who promised to build 
back better has only hindered Amer-
ica’s economic recovery. 
For a year, we have witnessed failure 
after failure. The American people 
have paid the price. Day after day, 
Hoosiers and Americans across the 
country experience the real ramifica-
tions of the Biden administration’s pol-
icy agenda. 
With inflation at a 40-year high, we 
are paying the price of the President’s 
reckless spending during every trip to 
the grocery store and the gas station. 
Despite spending trillions of dollars 
on the President’s so-called rescue 
plan, we are facing escalating supply 
chain bottlenecks and workforce short-
ages with no end in sight. 
Thanks to the Biden administration’s 
open border policy, every town across 
America is a border town. As illicit 
drugs pour across the open southern 
border, including a 1,000 percent in-
crease of fentanyl last year, every 
neighborhood is at risk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H209 
January 18, 2022 
While Democrats work to defund the 
police, Americans are facing dangerous 
crime surges in cities all across the 
country. 
In the end, it all comes down to con-
trol. If you don’t want to get the vac-
cine, you are fired. If you dare to ask 
what your children are learning in 
school, you are labeled a domestic ter-
rorist. 
This is America under 52 weeks of 
Joe Biden’s leadership. The American 
people deserve better. 
b 1930 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from the great State of 
Indiana for her comments. I know she 
and I both agree that Hoosiers are sick 
and tired of this leadership, or lack 
thereof, that we have seen from Presi-
dent Biden over the last year. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX), the ranking member of the 
House Education and Labor Committee 
and a great mentor and colleague. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Indiana for holding 
this Special Order tonight and calling 
attention to the problems of the past 
year. 
I could use many words to describe 
President Biden’s first full year in of-
fice, but the one that comes to mind 
immediately is incompetence. 
There is a blueprint for the economic 
and societal ruin that has stabbed 
America in its back for a year. This ad-
ministration is the architect of that 
blueprint. 
Inflation has skyrocketed to its high-
est level in 40 years. 
Job creators have faced innumerable 
setbacks that have threatened their 
livelihoods. 
The ever-growing Federal bureauc-
racy has metastasized like a cancer. 
Parents have been targeted by the 
FBI and DOJ in what can only be de-
scribed as a wave of new-age McCar-
thyism that has been spun by this ad-
ministration. 
The southern border has all but col-
lapsed due to gross mismanagement. 
The list goes on and on. 
Simply put, the policies and actions 
of this administration mirror the agen-
da of political arsonists. 
No matter how ambitious or forward- 
thinking 
the 
Biden 
administration 
tries to bill itself as, it cannot shake 
the stench of incompetence that sur-
rounds every initiative it heads up. 
Socialism is no longer an ominous 
shadow on the horizon. This adminis-
tration has brought it to our doorstep. 
This great country must be saved 
from the ruin that this administration 
has created. 
Republicans will be the ones to save 
it. 
Republicans will be the ones to safe-
guard the values and freedoms that 
have always defined America. 
Republicans will be the ones to turn 
this country around and deliver for the 
American people. 
When we retake the House of Rep-
resentatives and the Senate this year, 
that is precisely what we will do. 
Americans demand it, and we will 
act. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, from 
Indiana to North Carolina to Kansas 
and beyond, the American people are 
feeling the effects of this disastrous ad-
ministration. 
I yield to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. ESTES), my colleague and my 
friend, a senior member of the House 
Ways and Means Committee, and a 
leader in the Republican Study Com-
mittee. 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, this 
week we look back over a year of fail-
ures; from the economy and crime to 
foreign policy and national security. 
There is not one area where a year of 
total Democrat control shouldn’t re-
ceive an F. 
It is hard to believe it was only a 
year ago this Thursday that President 
Biden swore to uphold the Constitution 
just outside the building from where 
we stand today. 
Despite assuring the American people 
that he sought to unify the country, 
Biden’s first hours in office were 
marked by divisive and controversial 
executive orders. 
Biden’s incompetent economic poli-
cies destroyed our chance at a strong 
economic recovery and harmed hard-
working families and small businesses. 
A year later, Americans are paying 
about 50 percent more each time they 
fill up their tank. That is after Presi-
dent Biden canceled the Keystone XL 
pipeline, halted new oil and gas leasing 
on Federal land, and proposed burden-
some taxes and regulations on small 
energy producers. These policies all 
matter. They impact real people. 
That is why tonight I wanted to 
share some insight and experiences 
from folks in Kansas after a year of 
President Biden holding office. 
Nick, a new father in Derby, has cer-
tainly noticed the increase in fuel. He 
just had a baby last year and started a 
new job. Paying more at the pump 
means 
that 
he 
has 
less 
for 
his 
newborn’s needs, and as every new par-
ent knows, diapers aren’t cheap. 
But that is not the only thing Kan-
sans are paying more for. 
The Biden administration has di-
rectly caused rising prices by flooding 
the economy with their Big Govern-
ment spending. The prices of many 
other everyday goods like beef, bacon, 
eggs, chicken, and coffee. 
That is a lot for any American, but it 
is especially noticeable for Nancy, a 
grandmother on a fixed income. She 
shared that each time she goes to the 
grocery store she notices her grocery 
bill keeps going up. 
That is not to mention bare shelves 
and out-of-stock items that many Kan-
sans have experienced when they go 
shopping. 
Beyond the economy, we have wit-
nessed the failure to keep our country 
safe from illicit drugs flowing into our 
country at the southern border. 
Executive orders have halted the pro-
duction of a barrier at our southern 
border, and open border policies have 
allowed drugs and trafficking to be-
come commonplace. Every State is 
now a border State, as fentanyl makes 
its way to communities in Kansas and 
across the country. 
CBP reports that more pounds of 
fentanyl were seized at the southern 
border than in the previous 2 years 
combined. 
In a recent survey, a majority of 
Kansans from my district told me the 
issues of most importance to them are 
the economy, rising prices, immigra-
tion, and our Federal deficit. 
It is time for Congress and the Presi-
dent to start addressing these core con-
cerns. Americans cannot afford another 
year of radical socialist policies with 
this administration. 
I thank my good friend from Indiana 
for hosting this Special Order. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. ESTES for his comments. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. MOORE), one 
of our leaders in Congress on the Re-
publican side fighting for veterans 
every day on the Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee, and my colleague and 
friend. 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to mark the 1- 
year anniversary of the Biden adminis-
tration. And what a year it has been. 
The crisis raging across our Nation 
because of the incompetency of this ad-
ministration threaten the lives and 
livelihoods of countless Americans. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden gave a taste of what was to come 
by spitefully eliminating President 
Trump’s border policies and stopping 
the wall, fueling a border crisis that we 
have not seen in a generation. 
The drug and human trafficking that 
we have seen at our porous border 
reaches every community in our Na-
tion. Untold numbers of American fam-
ilies who have lost loved ones to drugs 
and violence, those families will be 
broken forever. 
But instead of coming after crimi-
nals, Biden’s Justice Department has 
focused its crosshairs on engaged par-
ents—moms and dads—and labeling 
them just because they had concerns 
about CRT or maybe mask mandates, 
they are labeled as domestic terrorists 
and now are charged with hate crimes. 
Our economy is in shambles. The 
Biden jobs deficit, the difference be-
tween jobs created and those he prom-
ised to create as part of his so-called 
stimulus from March, has swelled to 
1.11 million. 
Historic inflation has surged to the 
highest level in four decades. Gas and 
energy prices are at the highest they 
have been since the Obama-Biden ad-
ministration. 
The supply chain crisis has brought 
any economic recovery to a standstill. 
Have you been to the grocery store 
lately? Retailers are facing a 12 percent 
out-of-stock level on many household

staples. Empty shelves are the new 
norm. 
And let’s not forget the pandemic. 
President Biden centered his campaign 
on having a solution for the virus. It is 
clear now that like every other crisis 
we face, Biden has no plan. 
By resorting to harmful and uncon-
stitutional mandates and shutdowns, 
President Biden is threatening the very 
liberty that is the foundation of this 
great American experiment. 
And then there is Afghanistan, an 
issue that is very personal to me. What 
the Biden administration allowed to 
happen there, leaving so many Ameri-
cans and allies behind to the Taliban is 
a historic tragedy. 
But does Joe Biden seek unity? No. 
He resorts to smearing over half the 
American people who disagree with his 
radical agenda. 
But that is how this leadership of the 
Democratic 
Party 
in 
Washington 
thinks. They believe that the country 
is theirs to govern as they wish, to 
force their will on you and me. 
Well, we have had 1 year of Demo-
cratic Party control; and in only 1 
year, the Democratic Party has tried 
to take our country from us. I say it is 
time we take it back. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, as 
President Biden continues to fail the 
American people in so many ways and 
his poor leadership has created crisis 
after crisis after crisis, I can’t think of 
anywhere in the country that shows us 
just the opposite type of leadership 
than the free and open State of Flor-
ida. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Mrs. 
CAMMACK), one of Florida’s great lead-
ers, a freshman leader in the Repub-
lican Study Committee, my colleague 
and friend. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from the great State 
of Indiana for yielding, and I am still 
holding out for my honorary Hoosier 
title. 
Madam Speaker, this week we mark 1 
year since Joe Biden was sworn in as 
President and Commander in Chief of 
the United States. Now, there are 
525,600 minutes in a whole year, and 
somehow Biden has used every single 
one of those minutes to diminish and 
destroy the strength of the American 
economy, its workers, and our national 
security. During the first year of the 
Biden Presidency, America has faced 
more COVID deaths than in the prior 
year, a disastrous exit from Afghani-
stan of which we are still getting 
Americans out, a 40-year high inflation 
rate, and so much more. 
Now, this country has spent the last 
year staring down a border crisis that 
has gone unmanaged and a pandemic 
that has gone unabated. In 2021 alone, 
there were over 1.7 million border en-
counters. Keep in mind, the compari-
son of 500,000 or less the year prior. 
Now, while our brave border agents 
were left underresourced and unsup-
ported, this administration first at-
tempted to ignore the crisis then 
sought to downplay the consequences. 
The so-called border czar, Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS, refused to visit the border 
and see this crisis firsthand. This 
amounted to criminal negligence, and 
Americans won’t soon forget the role 
that Biden and his administration 
played 
in 
dramatically 
weakening 
America’s national security. 
Now, as millions of illegal immi-
grants poured over our southwest bor-
der, COVID continued to sweep through 
the United States. The Biden adminis-
tration was caught flatfooted, once 
again, on testing capacity nationwide 
and distribution of critical lifesaving 
therapeutic treatments. In my home 
State of Florida, we had a fantastic 
monoclonal antibody treatment pro-
gram going, and the Federal Govern-
ment stepped in and stopped it. Why? 
Because they are threatened by the 
freedom. They are threatened by the 
success. Over 440,000 Americans have 
lost their lives to COVID–19 under the 
Biden administration. That is more 
than when the pandemic began and the 
entire year of 2020. 
Further, images of high gas prices at 
the pump and empty shelves at the su-
permarket define the first year of the 
Biden Presidency. As our Nation has 
grappled with a global pandemic, this 
administration has stood on the side-
lines while Americans have struggled 
to get basic necessities. Every sector of 
the American economy has been hurt 
by supply chain issues caused in part 
by abusive Chinese trade practices and, 
also, weak administrative leadership. 
On top of these mounting challenges, 
the Biden administration has put the 
entirety of their political capital be-
hind over $6 trillion worth of so-called 
social justice spending bills meant to 
prop up failing government programs 
and a liberal wish list of items. The 
economic devastation from so much 
uncontrolled spending has already been 
felt in historic levels of inflation and 
will certainly be burdening generations 
of Americans to come. 
This administration’s first year in of-
fice has been a disaster from top to 
bottom. Instead of working to change 
positively, Biden has worked to change 
our country into a population of de-
pendents because that is, at the end of 
the day, what this administration is 
about: Dependency and control. 
We can take our country back, and 
we will. To Americans hurting in the 
first 52 weeks of this administration, 
remember, November is coming. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Florida for her com-
ments. 
I yield to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN), one of the 
greatest voices of common sense in the 
entire Congress, a senior Republican 
leader on the House Education and 
Labor Committee, my colleague, and 
friend. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
has just been said, I think the first 
year of this administration has been 
about as disastrous as it could possibly 
be. 
I will focus on the COVID pandemic. 
Over 300,000 people had died when 
President Biden took office, neverthe-
less, things in a way were looking up. 
Donald Trump had been given a com-
bination of monoclonal antibodies and 
several other things in a cocktail in 
which he was cured just a few months 
before President Biden took office. 
One would have thought all one had 
to do was follow down the path of 
treatment that Donald Trump received 
and it would be the end of the pan-
demic. Instead, we are over a year after 
him taking office, and at least in Wis-
consin 
we 
don’t 
have 
enough 
monoclonal antibodies to deal with the 
people who are sick today. 
Even 
though 
ivermectin 
and 
hydroxychloroquine have also shown 
promise, the CDC and NIH under Presi-
dent Biden have not shown a leadership 
role and encouraged more doctors to 
use them. Vitamin D can do a tremen-
dous job in reducing the number of peo-
ple who succumb to this disease, but 
again, a complete lack of leadership 
out of Washington, some people feel a 
complete lack of leadership because 
there is not enough money to be made 
in Vitamin D by the drug companies. 
b 1945 
We recently had calcifediol imported 
into this country from other countries, 
and it has not been anywhere near pub-
licized as it should be. It is time for 
President Biden to step up, to make 
sure monoclonal antibodies are avail-
able to everybody and put an end to 
the pandemic. I have had my own staff-
er use monoclonal antibodies, and it 
turned him around from being quite ill 
within 24 hours just fine. 
Madam Speaker, it is time to look at 
things other than just making money 
for the drug companies. It is time to 
solve this problem. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
FITZGERALD), my colleague and a fresh-
man Member of the House. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as we are hearing 
from many of my colleagues tonight, 
there is no shortage of policy failures 
to reflect on as we approach President 
Biden’s 1-year anniversary. But the one 
that is still beyond belief and a com-
plete disaster is the cancellation of the 
Keystone pipeline project. 
On day one, just hours after being 
sworn into office, the President halted 
construction of the pipeline, bringing 
down thousands of good jobs, many of 
them in my home State of Wisconsin 
and many of them in my district. This 
decision undermined our country’s en-
ergy independence and destroyed a safe 
and efficient route to transport oil. 
Oh, and now Russia is flush with cash 
as they market their oil around the en-
tire globe. That is right. Killing the 
Keystone project didn’t just stop the 
transportation of oil; it completely

reconfigured the way that this works 
globally. 
Listen, while President Biden con-
tinues to ignore the negative implica-
tions of his agenda, my Republican col-
leagues and I have been on the fore-
front proposing solutions—in this case, 
the Keystone XL Pipeline Construction 
and Jobs Preservation Act. 
Madam Speaker, after seeing the dis-
aster that President Biden left in his 
wake after only 1 year, I can only fear 
what will come in the next 3 years. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
GARCI´A), a fellow veteran and friend. 
Mr. GARCI´A of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman and 
shipmate from Indiana for this eve-
ning’s Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, we the people really 
aren’t asking much of our elected offi-
cials. Above all things, we just want 
them to do what is right for our coun-
try and be on the side of Americans. 
This isn’t a party thing. This isn’t a 
Republican versus Democrat thing. Re-
gardless of party affiliation, we just 
want them to do what is right for the 
country. 
The current Presidential administra-
tion and its policies have failed us in 
this regard and in a frighteningly short 
period of time. In just 1 year, this ad-
ministration and its policies have erod-
ed America’s status as the lone, pre-
mier superpower; eroded our energy 
independence, making us once again 
beholden to OPEC, literally begging 
Middle Eastern nations to provide us 
with more oil; eroded an economy that 
was thriving before COVID and begin-
ning to recover in the midst of COVID, 
and now, we are experiencing inflation 
that we haven’t seen in 40 years; eroded 
our Nation’s security, tucking tail 
against a group of savages and terror-
ists in Afghanistan after 20 years of 
fighting for the right reasons. 
After almost 2 years of no American 
deaths in Afghanistan and relative sta-
bility in a country that was formerly a 
breeding ground for terrorists, this ad-
ministration set an arbitrary exit date 
and backed that date up with abso-
lutely no plan. This admin stranded 
hundreds of Americans in Afghanistan 
and left our allies high and dry. The ad 
hoc and sloppy withdrawal led to the 
death of these 13 precious American 
servicemembers—absolutely avoidable 
and absolutely the fault of this admin-
istration. 
We are really not asking for much 
from our elected officials. We the peo-
ple just want this administration to 
stop giving hope to the bad guys and to 
start taking care of our Nation, our 
workers, our jobs, the small business 
owners, our children and their edu-
cation, and to allow parents the right 
to understand what our children are 
being taught in school, the right to 
make school choices for our children. 
We are asking that the administra-
tion stop calling parents terrorists and 
start preventing actual terrorists from 
infiltrating our country. We are asking 
for secure borders, so we don’t see 
175,000 human beings come across our 
border and into our Nation each month 
without any accountability. 
If you care about the Dreamers, if 
you care about the potential DACA re-
cipients, like many of us do, then you 
must first end this man-made border 
crisis. 
We are really not asking for much. 
We just want someone to stand up and 
fight against this ridiculous defund the 
police movement and make our streets 
safe again. 
We don’t want the cost of goods and 
supply chain issues to overcome our in-
come. We are asking simply that we 
fairly value the time, the skills, and 
the experience of our workers so that 
when they work harder and provide 
quality 
service, 
they 
make 
more 
money and keep more money. We don’t 
want higher taxes only to see the gov-
ernment at all levels squander our 
hard-earned money. 
Madam Speaker, above all things, we 
just want the President to be on our 
side and to have the backbone to stand 
up for the good guys. We are not asking 
for much. We just want this adminis-
tration to stop giving hope to the bad 
guys. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, thanks 
to our next speaker, I have been to the 
border in Arizona and Texas, both dur-
ing President Trump’s Presidency and 
now during President Biden’s Presi-
dency. What our next speaker has 
taught me along the way is the night- 
and-day difference. The border was 
under control under President Trump; 
it is wide open under President Biden. 
What I have learned and what I have 
stressed more than ever before is that 
what is going on at the border impacts 
my district in northeast Indiana every 
single day. 
Our next speaker is the co-chair of 
the Border Security Caucus. No one 
does more in Congress to highlight 
these issues and work toward pro-
tecting and securing our border than 
Dr. BRIAN BABIN. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I really 
appreciate the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. BANKS), the chairman of the Re-
publican Study Committee. I thank 
him so much for having this very im-
portant Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, this week marks 1 
year since Joe Biden became President, 
and what a lawless year this has been. 
Never in my entire life would I have 
dreamed that we would have a Presi-
dent who prioritizes criminals and ille-
gal aliens over law-abiding American 
citizens. But here we are. 
The reckless policies coming out of 
this White House and the Democratic 
Party as a whole have put you and 
your families in grave danger. 
It is not hard to see where the left’s 
demonization of law enforcement and 
the decision to gut police department 
funding has gotten us. Thanks to the 
Democrats, we are now in the midst of 
a crime wave with record-high homi-
cide rates in more than a dozen major 
cities across this great country of ours. 
The city of Chicago alone saw at least 
800 homicides in 2021, a number that we 
haven’t seen in decades. Bad policies 
lead to bad consequences. And folks, we 
are living these in technicolor. 
More than 100 of our brave police offi-
cers were shot in ambush-style attacks 
last year. Meanwhile, we have seen vio-
lent criminals released into our neigh-
borhoods 
to 
commit 
more 
violent 
crimes. 
It is happening in my own district in 
Houston, Texas, in the 36th Congres-
sional District, which had its deadliest 
year in nearly 40 years. In Harris Coun-
ty, 113 criminals were granted bond 
after capital murder charges in 2021. 
Yes, you heard that right: capital mur-
der charges. 
Numerous Harris County citizens 
have been murdered by repeat crimi-
nals out on bail, murders which, trag-
ically, could have been avoided. Inno-
cent Americans are being hurt and 
killed by this foolhardy Democrat pol-
icy. But accountability starts at the 
top. Will this crime wave be just an-
other crisis to go unresolved in 2022, or 
will this President and his party come 
back to reality and work with us to 
stop it? 
America is watching. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, when I 
became the chairman of the Repub-
lican Study Committee, which is not 
just the largest conservative caucus in 
Congress but the largest caucus overall 
in the entire United States Capitol, I 
had to choose someone to lead the Re-
publican Study Committees’ Budget 
and Spending Task Force. 
For almost 50 years, this task force 
and the Republican Study Committee 
has put forth a fiscally responsible bal-
anced budget in the Congress to lead 
the way toward fiscal responsibility. 
And no one has done a better job of 
that in my time in Congress than 
KEVIN HERN, a small business owner 
from the great State of Oklahoma. He 
has chaired and run this effort well. 
Over the last year, we put out a budg-
et that we showed to the Congress. We 
could balance the budget in 6 years. 
That is in stark contrast to what the 
Democrats and President Biden have 
done to put forth the largest budget 
that this country has ever seen. 
I don’t just appreciate the leadership 
of Representative HERN; I am proud of 
the effort he put forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Indiana for the op-
portunity to speak to everyone to-
night. 
Madam Speaker, this week marks a 
historic milestone, the 1-year anniver-
sary of the Biden Presidency. There is 
a date in January that 1 year ago has 
affected all Americans, and that was 
the election of Joe Biden to the Presi-
dency, his taking office. 
Looking back at the previous 12 
months, several words come to mind:

January 18, 2022 
failure, confusion, disarray, pain, dis-
honesty. 
I am sure that many of my col-
leagues will touch on these and many 
other themes relevant to what has un-
folded at the White House since its lat-
est occupant took office some 11 
months ago. However, I want to focus 
on one word that has defined the Biden 
administration this year, and that is 
‘‘inflation.’’ 
Every single month since Biden took 
office, inflation has risen higher. In the 
past 11 months, inflation has reached 
its highest level in 40 years. 
Most of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle have never experienced this 
type of inflation. The last time it was 
this bad, ‘‘E.T.’’ was showing in thea-
ters. Jimmy Carter, the man largely 
responsible for those hardships, was a 
one-term President for this very rea-
son. 
Thanks to the Biden job-killing poli-
cies, taxpayers are paying the price. 
Our economic recovery is stagnant. 
Our small businesses are being crushed 
out of existence. December brought us 
to a 7 percent increase in inflation over 
the previous year, a number that 
American families are feeling every 
single day in their pocketbooks. 
While inflation is up 7 percent, wages 
have only risen 4.7 percent, meaning 
that real wages are actually negative, 
not positive. Americans are paying a 
whopping $3,500 more for basic neces-
sities than they were last year. For all 
the back-patting Biden has done for 
the dismal number of jobs created 
under his administration, we are still 
over 
4 
million 
jobs 
short 
of 
prepandemic levels. 
This is the Biden economy. Polling 
proves that inflation is the top-of-mind 
issue for the vast majority of Ameri-
cans. So you would think that this ad-
ministration would be doing every-
thing in their power to alleviate that 
burden. Instead, they are focused on 
flushing the markets with even more 
unchecked spending. When will it end? 
The President’s dismal approval rat-
ing isn’t a result of his standing with 
Republican voters, who haven’t liked 
him from the start. Rather, Democrat 
and independent voters across the 
country are voicing their strong dis-
pleasure with how poorly our country 
has been run this past year. 
We know what works, and we know 
what doesn’t. What the President is 
doing is only exacerbating the problem, 
something just about everyone outside 
of D.C. knows. 
The White House must stop the 
spending spree, stop imposing uncon-
stitutional mandates, and stop pushing 
radical legislation. The best thing this 
President could do right now is just get 
out of the way. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Oklahoma again for 
his leadership and the important words 
that he had to share with us tonight. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. CARL), a 
new member of the House Committee 
on Armed Services who is playing an 
outsized role on the Committee on 
Armed Services as we work hard to 
support our troops who need our sup-
port more than ever before. 
Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BANKS), my colleague, for organizing 
this Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, when my father was 
a child, he sold newspapers on the 
streets in Oklahoma City. He was 6, 7, 
and 8 years old. He would tell me sto-
ries that they would show up every 
morning and fight over the best cor-
ners because they knew they could sell 
the most newspapers. That was when 
we were in the middle of a depression. 
We are not in a depression today— 
yet. But yet, we still have fighting over 
those same corners. 
Today, instead of fighting over the 
sale of newspapers, they are fighting 
over the sale of drugs, and these are il-
legal drugs that are coming across our 
border. 
b 2000 
Most people don’t realize how potent 
fentanyl is. Let me give you an exam-
ple. One grain, one single grain of 
fentanyl can kill a grown man. You can 
take two packs of sweetener that you 
sweeten your drink with; that is 
enough to kill every member of Con-
gress, House and Senate, to give you 
some idea of how potent these drugs 
are. Could you imagine a 50-pound 
backpack of it coming across our open 
borders? 
My personal observation is these 
intercity killings are primarily against 
minority communities. Where is the 
outrage for these children which are 
our responsibility? They are our re-
sponsibility, not another person’s re-
sponsibility. 
Our 
communities 
are 
being flooded with illegal drugs being 
brought in from the left and the right, 
across our southern borders. My Demo-
crat colleagues remain silent. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
truly 
believe 
President Biden cares about the lives 
that are being lost due to illegal drugs 
and the violence that is being claimed 
due to these illegal drugs. But where is 
he? Why is the President not being the 
leader that he was elected to be? We 
need a President that is a leader and 
that will step out there. 
We have had a full year to address 
this simple issue. This simple issue is 
the illegal drugs. No one seems to be 
paying attention. I promise you it af-
fects every family. Every family in 
America that has a family member or 
friend that has been affected by this 
fentanyl needs to hear this because we 
can stop it. We can do it. 
This is an American issue that all 
communities should be in an uproar 
about. There are simple, commonsense 
solutions to fix this problem. I am ask-
ing, no, I am begging President Biden 
to sit down at the table and work 
across the aisle. Let’s secure our south-
ern border and stop the flow of these il-
legal drugs into our community that 
are killing, killing our kids. 
Let’s build a wall now instead of 
stopping the wall. Let’s build a wall 
now and finally put safety and security 
back into America. First and foremost, 
our responsibility is the safety of the 
citizens of this country. 
Mr. President, please hear my plea. 
Now is the time to take action. We 
need an American leader. 
Mr. BANKS. I thank the gentleman 
from Alabama, Mr. CARL. It is such a 
powerful statement as we think about 
the drugs that are flooding over the 
border, that are impacting commu-
nities, destroying families. 
The lack of attention by this admin-
istration to do anything about it is ap-
palling to the American people. As 
they see what is going on at the border, 
they know the border is wide open. 
They know that this President is re-
sponsible for the lack of leadership to 
secure the border that has allowed 
drugs to flow into communities and af-
fect and destroy so many families 
across this country. 
Enough is enough. We call on the 
President. We ask President Biden to 
step up to the plate and address this 
issue so that more families aren’t ru-
ined, and more communities aren’t de-
stroyed because of the amount of drugs 
and the drug epidemic that is affecting 
our country. 
Again, I said in my opening state-
ment fentanyl is now the leading cause 
of death for Americans aged 18 to 45. 
Why isn’t the President paying atten-
tion to that statistic and doing any-
thing about it to address it? 
Madam Speaker, next, I yield to a 
senior member of the House Armed 
Services Committee, someone who I 
know has a heart for our veterans, 
someone who has served under four 
Presidents since he has been in Con-
gress. His perspective is powerful. 
I yield to the gentleman from South 
Carolina, (Mr. WILSON), my colleague, 
mentor, and friend. 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. As 
we reach the one-year anniversary of 
President Biden in office, I borrow 
from the great Ronald Reagan and his 
extraordinary question during the 1980 
Presidential debate and ask: Are you 
better off today than you were a year 
ago? The obvious and sad answer of 
thinking Americans is no. 
Since President Biden took office 
January 20, American families have 
suffered under a one-party Democrat 
rule, destroying jobs. The continued 
taxing and spending policies of Biden 
and Democrats have caused inflation. 
This situation is getting worse and will 
challenge our children’s future, while 
threatening the savings of retirees. 
Bidenflation has hit the highest rate 
in 40 years, and the astronomical price 
increases that come with that affect all 
of our pocketbooks. A few examples in-
clude, gas is up 56 percent higher than 
over a year ago. Propane, kerosene, 
and firewood are up 40 percent. Beef 
and bacon are up 19 percent. Chicken is 
up 10 percent. 
Compounding this damaging effect, 
most workers have not received wages

January 18, 2022 
that keep up with inflation, according 
to The New York Times. Families have 
actually lost possibly $5,000 in just one 
year. Also, the December Jobs Report 
came in at less than half where econo-
mists projected. 
Since President Biden took office, he 
has failed to protect our southern bor-
der. Over 1.7 million illegal aliens have 
invaded, benefiting the drug cartels 
and benefiting the horror of promoting 
human trafficking. 
Energy independence has been re-
placed by energy dependence, resulting 
in 
skyrocketing 
costs. 
President 
Biden’s policies worldwide have been 
disastrous. A feeble response to Putin 
is putting Ukrainian families at risk of 
mass murder with already 14,000 people 
killed; bowing to China as it continues 
the 
genocide 
of 
weaker 
Muslims; 
capitulating to Iran as it shouts death 
to America, death to Israel; appease-
ment of Afghanistan leading directly 
to thirteen American heroes murdered; 
leaving Americans behind and estab-
lishing Afghanistan as a safe haven to 
attack American families with suicide 
bombers, as we saw claimed this week-
end at the Texas synagogue. 
American families have never been at 
greater risk of attack than they are 
today in American history. The Demo-
crat elite think they are smarter than 
everyone, and they think Democrat 
voters and Democrat media are igno-
rant to believe $5 trillion in spending 
costs zero. That is a direct quote from 
the President. 
So I ask the rhetorical and famous 
question again. Are you better off 
today than you were a year ago? 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, last 
but not least, I yield to the gentleman 
from the great state of Texas, (Mr. 
ARRINGTON), my friend, someone who 
fights so hard for freedom, for families. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. I thank the gen-
tleman from Indiana (Mr. BANKS), my 
friend and colleague from the Hoosier 
State. 
Looking back over the last year 
under the leadership of this President 
and single-party rule, for a guy who 
wants my team to win, my team is not 
the Republican Party, Madam Speaker. 
It is the great United States of Amer-
ica. It is my children, quite frankly. 
Personally, it is my children who I 
want to inherit the blessings of liberty 
and opportunity in this great country. 
That is our greatest calling, to hand 
this country back better than we found 
it, take on the challenges that face our 
country, work together to solve the 
problems, and make this a better, 
stronger, safer, more prosperous, more 
free Nation for the next generation. 
That has not happened, not even close, 
not even close. 
I am disappointed to say that this 
President and his colleagues in the 
Democratic 
Party 
have 
absolutely 
failed our country. I didn’t say they 
were bad people. In fact, there are 
many of them I would call friend and 
proudly. As a team elected by the 
American people to do the job I out-
lined, they have failed miserably. As 
we say in west Texas on Saturday 
morning after Friday night lights, 
when we are looking at the film, the 
eye in the sky doesn’t lie. If you look 
at the footage, you watch the film, you 
can’t help but see one self-inflicted dis-
aster after another. 
Madam Speaker, let’s start with the 
tone and the promise to unify this 
country and its leaders, to usher into 
this Chamber and to politics and polit-
ical rhetoric civility and unity. That is 
a big F. 
This President, I would say, took 
more unilateral actions and, along 
with his Democrat leaders in Congress, 
have jammed through more partisan 
bills than they have worked together 
to address the issues facing this coun-
try. We are more divided today than we 
were. 
If our Speaker, Ms. PELOSI, would ac-
tually focus on the things that would 
be required to prevent another riot on 
this Capitol, then you would have the 
Capitol Police and the Inspector Gen-
eral of the Capitol Police saying, we 
are better prepared than we were a 
year ago. We are actually less prepared 
today because there has been so much 
hyper-partisanship and so much polit-
ical weaponization and theater than 
there has actually been real governing 
of our great country. So there is the 
tone which is failure. 
The most important job of the Fed-
eral Government is to provide for a 
common defense. It is the safety and 
security of the American people. I 
know you have heard Chairman BANKS. 
I am sure the remarks today have been 
replete with the debacle in Afghanistan 
and the sadness with which all Ameri-
cans watched that. At the same time 
that they watched this needless, sense-
less incompetence, they saw America’s 
credibility slip quickly, not only with 
our enemies but with our allies. I don’t 
know if there was ever a time that the 
American troops packed up and left 
with Americans, our fellow citizens, 
crying out because we left them be-
hind. 
There is a litany of problems with 
what happened in Afghanistan. This 
President is ultimately responsible. He 
didn’t listen to his advisors. People 
died. Our troops, we spent 20 years and 
trillions of dollars, we lost the lives of 
our sons and daughters in uniform to 
the tune of roughly 2,400. What do we 
have to show for it besides that embar-
rassment of a withdrawal? 
I live in Texas. We are at ground zero 
with respect to the chaos at the border 
and the record number of people and 
crime activity and drugs that are 
powering into our country. This Presi-
dent has been derelict in fulfilling his 
sacred duty to uphold the law, plain 
and simple. 
Worse, working with his Democrat 
colleagues in this Chamber, they have 
poured fuel on the fire that is burning 
out of control at the border by saying 
we will give you more carrots. We will 
create more incentives. We will turn 
the volume up so that people will come 
in by the millions with the offer of rep-
aration, with the offer of citizenship, 
mass amnesty, the ability to vote in 
our elections. 
You can’t make this up, but this bor-
der crisis is real. The American people 
who live along the border feel like this 
President and their government has 
given up on them and has failed them. 
I would agree. 
With respect to the economy, I know 
we had a tough job for all Americans 
and all leaders for both parties to get 
us up and out of the recession related 
to the pandemic. For this President 
and my Democrat colleagues, to put 
policies in place that incentivize people 
to stay at home rather than to go back 
to work, I am talking about enhanced 
unemployment policies. I am talking 
about welfare expansion without work 
requirements, actually a repeal of work 
requirements. To put massive amounts 
of government spending into the mar-
ketplace, it is no wonder that we are 
seeing runaway inflation in every cor-
ner of our marketplace and in every 
good and every service that our work-
ing Americans depend on. 
b 2015 
The majority of Americans who live 
paycheck to paycheck have lost almost 
$400 a month on account of the real 
wage decrease because of inflation, 
self-inflicted, one after another, and 
the state of the Union is more fragile 
now than ever. It is less hopeful than it 
was 1 year ago. 
I don’t see any posture of change or 
relenting on the horizon from this 
President, even with these startling 
statistics and facts that are laid out 
plainly for everybody to see. I am not 
bashful to give blame or credit to ei-
ther side when it is due, but this is a 
one-party rule. We haven’t even talked 
about the crime spree, we haven’t 
talked about the promises made and 
broken with respect to COVID, the au-
thoritarian mandates in one breath and 
action and in another breath saying 
that we are going to work together and 
defer to States, this isn’t a Federal so-
lution. I am confused. I am concerned. 
I have got to say 1 year in review is 
bleak and dismal. I don’t say that with 
partisan glee, I say it with tremendous 
sadness and with profound grief over 
the opportunities lost in a backslidden 
country where we can do so much bet-
ter. We have done better together. Re-
publicans don’t have all the answers. I 
don’t have all the answers. But this has 
not been the great, strong, and con-
structive leadership that our Nation 
has seen in the past from, quite frank-
ly, from both parties. 
So I hope and pray, Madam Speaker, 
that this President will hear not my 
voice but the voices of the American 
people, the voices who cried out from 
the will of the people in Virginia where 
the We the People wave has begun, and 
that we will make changes, and that he 
will focus on the real needs; he will 
stop placating the left, which seems to

be the MO and has been for the last 
year, and start focusing on the prior-
ities that are important to the Amer-
ican people and to working families: 
safer neighborhoods; a secure border; 
strong, effective, and respected mili-
tary and law enforcement; real growth; 
real opportunities; real wage increases 
like we saw when we cut taxes; and 
just a better quality of life and better 
hope over the horizon for our children. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. BANKS 
for allowing me to be a part of today’s 
Special Order. 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague and friend for so many 
important comments that he and the 
others have shared with us today as we 
mark the 1-year anniversary mark of 
President Biden taking office as the 
current President of the United States. 
Once again, this President ends his 
first year in office with the lowest ap-
proval rating of any President in 
American history. The American peo-
ple are feeling the decline of America. 
They see it, and they hate it because 
they know it doesn’t have to be this 
way. They are crying out for leader-
ship. They are begging the party in 
power—the Democratic Party that con-
trols the Congress and owns the White 
House under President Joe Biden—to 
do something about inflation, because 
they feel it and see it every day when 
they go to the grocery store. And they 
beg the Democratic Party to do so 
something about it. They are begging 
President Biden to address inflation, 
the worst inflation of my lifetime. 
They are baffled why the party in 
power and this President are com-
pletely tone-deaf to the needs of the 
American people as they suffer through 
this disastrous set of consequences of 
the policies of this President. 
Madam Speaker, you heard a lot to-
night about the effects of the COVID 
lockdowns and policies that have hurt 
our kids in schools and have hurt so 
many working Americans as they feel 
the pressures of these lockdowns and 
the failed policies of this administra-
tion. You have heard a lot tonight 
about the effects of fentanyl and the 
drugs that are coming over the wide- 
open border because of the failed bor-
der policies of this President. 
You have heard a lot tonight about 
the embarrassment that Afghanistan 
has caused the American people on the 
world stage. The American people 
know that when we put America’s in-
terests first in our foreign policy, the 
world is safer and better off. But under 
this President, America is less safe 
from North Korea to the Middle East, 
China and Russia, all of these countries 
are seizing on America’s weakness 
under President Biden’s leadership, and 
the world is less safe because of it. 
Madam Speaker, I call on the Demo-
cratic Party and President Biden to 
step up to the plate. America can’t af-
ford to suffer another 3 years of what 
they have suffered through over the 
last year. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President and the Vice President.

Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord God, at a time when 
people expect much from their leaders, 
give our lawmakers the wisdom to do 
the work of legislation, administra-
tion, and justice for the common good. 
When criticism comes from those who 
expect miracles and look for weakness, 
give to the Members of the Senate the 
grace of patience and love. 
Lord, brace them in Your strength 
against the debilitating effects of frus-
tration and futility as you infuse them 
with confidence in Your providential 
power. Bless them with love, faith, and 
perseverance. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

CONGREGATION BETH ISRAEL SHOOTING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I begin the substance of my remarks, I 
want to offer a few words in reaction to 
the terrible hostage situation this 
weekend in Texas. 
Saturday’s hostage crisis at Con-
gregation Beth Israel was a horrifying 
reminder that the ancient poison of 
anti-Semitism continues to this day. I 
am relieved that all of the hostages 
made it out alive, and I commend the 
quick thinking of the first responders 
and of Rabbi Charlie Citron-Walker, 
who acted valiantly, and all those 
present for bringing this crisis to an 
end. 
Moving forward, we must get to the 
bottom of what inspired the terrorist 
attack on Saturday but increase our 
vigilance against all forms of anti- 
Semitism and racially motivated vio-
lence. 
Here in Congress, we must continue 
working to increase our investment in 
nonprofit security grants to groups 
that are targets of hate. We need to 
give our communities the tools they 
need to protect themselves so they can 
live without fear of being targeted for 
just who they are. 
On this day, I stand in solidarity 
with the congregation of Beth Israel, 
the Jewish community of Greater Dal-
las-Ft. Worth, and with all Jewish 
Americans for whom Saturday’s attack 
was a traumatic reminder of the hate 
we have yet to overcome. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. President, this is on defending 
democracy. The eyes of the Nation will 
be watching what happens this week in 
the U.S. Senate. 
Just a few days removed from what 
would have been Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr.’s 93rd birthday, the Senate 
has begun debate on the Freedom to 
Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act—for the first 
time, the first time in this Congress. 
Democrats have tried for months to 
hold a voting rights debate on the 
floor, but we have been blocked each 
time by Republicans. We brought com-
monsense proposals four times on the 
floor of the Senate and only once did 
one Senator—LISA MURKOWSKI, to her 
credit—agree to even begin debate on 
voting rights. On all three other votes, 
not a single Republican joined us. 
Every one of them voted to block even 
a debate on voting rights. 
So, today, we are taking this step by 
using a message from the House. Now, 
it is just a step, but an important step 
moving forward, in that we will finally 
debate this one issue that is so central 
to the American people, to our history, 
and to our democracy. 
As we debate these measures, the 
Senate will confront a critical ques-
tion: Shall the Members of this Cham-
ber do what is necessary to pass these 
bills and bring them closer to the 
President’s desk? 
Today, we have just taken the first 
steps that will put everyone—every-
one—on the record. Much has been said 
over the past few days about the pros-
pects of passing voting rights legisla-
tion in this Chamber. Senate Demo-
crats are under no illusion that we face 
difficult odds, especially when vir-
tually every Senate Republican—every 
Senate 
Republican—is 
staunchly 
against legislation protecting the right 
to vote. 
But I want to be clear. When this 
Chamber confronts a question this im-
portant—one so vital to our country, so 
vital to our ideals, so vital to the fu-
ture of our democracy—you don’t slide 
it off the table and say, ‘‘Never mind.’’ 
Win, lose, or draw, Members of this 
Chamber were elected to debate and to 
vote, especially on an issue as vital to 
the beating heart of our democracy as 
voting rights. The public is entitled to 
know where each Senator stands on an 
issue as sacrosanct as defending our de-
mocracy. The American people deserve 
to see their Senators go on record on 
whether they will support these bills or 
oppose them. Indeed, that may be the 
only way to make progress on this 
issue now, for the public to see where 
each of us in this Chamber stands. The 
public deserves to see it, and that is ex-
actly, precisely, what the Senate is 
going to do this week. 
Make no mistake about it. Using Dr. 
King as an inspiration, Democrats will 
continue to fight on this issue until we 
succeed, and I believe history will vin-
dicate us. 
Mr. President, the fight over voting 
rights is as old as the Republic itself. 
Recently—well, let me say, when the 
Republic was founded, in many States 
you had to be a White male Protestant 
property owner to vote. As is obvious 
by who is in this Chamber, we have 
made progress—inexorable progress—in 
expanding that franchise. 
History does not regard those restric-
tions that occurred early on as worthy, 
but we must continue the fight. We 
have not reached the place where every 
person can vote easily and openly and 
honestly. So we have to keep it up. 
I have been reading the biography of 
Ulysses S. Grant by Ron Chernow. The 
No. 1 thing the southern segregation-
ists wanted to take away from the 
newly freed slaves was the right to 
vote. Segregationists back then knew 
that if recently freed Black slaves 
didn’t have the right to vote in the 
South, they would have no power at 
all: no power over laws, over resources, 
over the future of the country. And 
that was the No. 1 thing segregation-
ists wanted to prevent: the right of the 
newly freed slaves to vote. 
It is why, a century later, Dr. King 
made a direct appeal to Congress for 
acting on voting rights: ‘‘Give us the

ballot,’’ he said in 1957, ‘‘and we will no 
longer have to worry the federal gov-
ernment about our basic rights.’’ ‘‘Give 
us the ballot’’ and all other rights will 
follow. With the ballot, he argued, vot-
ers could end the worst of racial seg-
regation. They could elect good men 
and good women to government. They 
could subdue the dangers of the mob 
and keep democracy alive. But the bal-
lot had to come first. The ballot had to 
come first. 
Dr. King might as well have been 
speaking to us, because across the 
United States, in 2022, ballot access is 
not being expanded; it is being re-
pressed. And our democracy is not safe; 
it is under attack. 
A year ago, a violent mob incited by 
the President and his Big Lie attacked 
this very building in order to reverse 
the results of a free and fair election. 
Last week, for the first time, the De-
partment of Justice announced sedi-
tion charges against a number of the 
rioters who were here that day. 
A year later, at least 19 States have 
passed 33 laws that make it harder for 
people to vote, using the Big Lie—the 
Big Lie, as false as it is—as a justifica-
tion. Those States together are home 
to 55 million Americans, and new laws 
are certainly coming once the State 
legislatures return to session this year. 
And the kind of violence—the threats 
of violence—we saw on January 6 by 
that insurrectionist mob is now being 
threatened increasingly against count-
less election workers across the coun-
try. 
Just 
this 
weekend, 
the 
Houston 
Chronicle reported that ‘‘County offi-
cials in urban areas across the State 
[of Texas] say they’ve been forced to 
reject an unprecedented number of 
mail ballot applications [thanks to the 
new Republican voter suppression law.] 
And 
this 
past 
Saturday, 
Donald 
Trump once again repeated the same 
conspiracy theories about the 2020 elec-
tion that have paved the way for voter 
suppression at the State level. 
So, unfortunately, the dangers that 
face our democracy are alive and well, 
and the laws that suppress the vote at 
the State level are being enacted on a 
partisan basis. 
We have seen periods of regression, in 
terms of voting rights and equality and 
fairness to people of color. We have 
seen regression occur. And this seems 
to be a period of regression in what the 
legislatures are doing, and fight it we 
must. 
So the Senate must act. We must 
step in and act. We must do everything 
to pass voting rights legislation, just 
as this Chamber has done in the past, 
just as the Constitution permits us to 
do. That is why we will vote this week 
on the Freedom to Vote Act and the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act. And if Republicans choose to 
continue their filibuster of voting 
rights legislation, we must consider 
and vote on the rule changes that are 
appropriate and necessary to restore 
the Senate and make voting legislation 
possible. 
As I have recounted already, these 
laws are urgently needed. We must 
not—we cannot—allow another period 
of that regression, which we have seen 
throughout American history. 
Here is what some of the laws would 
do—our two laws would do: 
They would set basic commonsense 
standards for all Americans for access 
to 
the 
ballot 
as 
well 
as 
restore 
preclearance 
provisions 
that 
were 
passed by this Chamber for decades on 
a bipartisan basis. They would estab-
lish clear and consistent standards for 
early voting across the country and 
make it easier for voters to access ab-
sentee ballots. They would protect 
election workers from unlawful intimi-
dation. We are seeing so much of that 
now. 
It 
is 
disgraceful—disgraceful. 
They would end the toxic practice of 
partisan 
gerrymandering, 
and 
they 
would take new steps to fight the 
power of dark money corroding our 
elections. Senate Democrats repeat-
edly tried, over the last year, to bring 
Republicans to the table to debate 
these issues. 
I will remind my colleagues that this 
is not the old Republican Party. I 
would remind the American people how 
dramatically the Republican Party has 
regressed. The Republican Party used 
to be one that supported voting rights. 
Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, 
and George W. Bush worked to renew 
voting rights bills. 
No, sadly, unfortunately, this is Don-
ald Trump’s Republican Party. And it 
is the one now trying to take away the 
vote from younger Black and Brown, 
elderly, minority, and low-income vot-
ers. 
And yet every time we try to engage 
our Senate Republican colleagues, they 
resist it. So we have no choice. We are 
moving ahead on our own. 
Once again, no one denies the path 
ahead is an uphill struggle. Repub-
licans have been clear, they will enter-
tain no bipartisan compromise on vot-
ing rights, but long odds are no excuse 
for this Chamber to avoid this impor-
tant issue. 
Again, Members of this Chamber 
were elected to debate and to vote. We 
are going to vote. We are all going to 
go on the record. And Republicans will 
have to choose which side they stand 
on—protecting democracy or offering 
their implicit endorsement of Donald 
Trump’s Big Lie. 
For 
months, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have come up with excuses and subter-
fuges to avoid doing what they know is 
the right thing, just like so many oth-
ers have come up with similar lame ex-
cuses and subterfuges in the past. But 
as history shows, doing the right thing 
will eventually prevail. Justice will 
flow like mighty waters, as the Proph-
et Amos has said. 
The direction of voting rights in 
America is enough to have shaken the 
faith of even the most optimistic 
champion of America—of democracy. 
Sometimes it seems like for each step 
forward, the country takes two steps 
back, but fights like this are not un-
usual in American history. 
The story of our country has been a 
long, arduous march toward expanding 
the promise of freedom for all Ameri-
cans. We find ourselves in such a strug-
gle today. 
Dr. King had simple, powerful advice 
for his followers during moments like 
this: Keep moving. Keep fighting. The 
road to justice is often painful and full 
of setback, but we must keep moving. 
We must keep moving, he said, against 
every obstacle and prodigious hilltop 
and mountain of opposition. Let noth-
ing slow you down. And even after you 
cross the Red Sea only to find yourself 
in the desert, just keep moving forward 
through the wilderness. ‘‘And if you 
will do that with dignity,’’ he said, 
‘‘when the history books are written in 
the future, the historians will have to 
look back and say, ‘There lived a great 
people.’’’ 
We will keep fighting in the same 
spirit to protect our democracy in this 
day and age. And if we do that, I have 
faith that one day the history books 
will likewise look back at this genera-
tion 
of 
Americans 
and 
conclude, 
‘‘There lived a great people,’’ too. 
I yield the floor.

CONGREGATION BETH ISRAEL SHOOTING 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud 
the remarks of our distinguished ma-
jority leader, and I know it comes from 
the heart because what he is saying 
publicly, he has also always said both 
publicly and privately. And I also join 
with him in the condemnation of the 
attack on the synagogue this weekend. 
I know, in my State of Vermont, the 
faith community—the Jewish, Protes-
tant, Catholic—all came together with 
prayers for the safety of the people in 
the synagogue. But more than just the 
safety of what happened then, let us 
pray, all of us, whatever faith we have, 
that such attacks do not continue in 
our country. 
We have seen too many attacks 
against people based on their religion 
or based on their race or based on their 
country of origin. That is wrong. 
In this country, in this country, espe-
cially—I was thinking of this when I 
led the Senate this morning in the 
Pledge of Allegiance, and I thought, 
‘‘[O]ne nation under God, indivisible, 
with liberty and justice for all.’’ Well, 
it is a constant battle to make sure 
that we have liberty and justice for all, 
and we have to do that. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
And that leads us to where we are 
today. We have got to stand up and say 
people can vote. I remember being here 
and present when the Voting Rights 
Act was signed by President Reagan, 
President George H. W. Bush, and 
President George Bush. I remember the 
pleasure on their face, the look of ev-
erybody around them, Republicans and 
Democrats, applauding the President 
for signing that legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S232 
January 18, 2022 
Why did they applaud? Why did Re-
publicans and Democrats applaud? Be-
cause we had all voted for it because 
we all believed in a person’s right to 
vote. 
You know, I am the only Democrat 
ever elected to the U.S. Senate from 
the State of Vermont, and I remember 
my first two elections which were quite 
close. Ninety percent—I would say ap-
proximately 90 percent of the election 
machinery, those who count the ballots 
and whatnot, were controlled by Re-
publicans. 
But I had faith in getting through be-
cause I knew two things: One, they 
could count and, two, they were totally 
honest. 
And I am sure—especially in the vote 
in my first election, for the vast major-
ity who voted for my opponent, an hon-
orable person, they were happy to have 
counted the ballots, and the State said 
where the ballots were. And there was 
even a recount in my second election, 
it was so close. 
And I remember one of the Repub-
lican auditing groups sent out a fund-
raiser, saying we have to fight the 
Democratic-controlled 
election 
ma-
chinery of Vermont. And I reminded 
them that the ‘‘election machinery’’ 
was 250 town clerks, 80 to 90 percent of 
whom were Republicans. 
And I say again: They can count, and 
they are honest. 
We are fortunate in our State that 
we encourage everybody to vote. And I 
remember when the Senators of the 
other party and the Judiciary Com-
mittee said: Well, you want—you want 
to change the rules so that Democrats 
would win. 
I said: We want, nationally, the kind 
of rules we follow in Vermont. And, by 
the way, in last year’s election, we 
elected a Republican Governor and a 
Democratic 
Lieutenant 
Governor. 
Why? Because our rules do not favor 
one party over the other. Our rules 
favor one thing—the right to vote. And 
we insist on that in our State of 
Vermont, but we should insist on that 
throughout the country. 
It should not be a case where some-
body can be blocked from voting be-
cause the voting booths and the places 
for them are changed so that some 
communities would have a harder time 
or a more difficult time to come there 
or hours change. No. We should be 
fighting. 
If we want America to be the strong, 
great Nation that we all claim it is and 
we all believe it is and we all want it to 
be, it can only be if we say make sure 
everybody gets to vote—everybody. I 
don’t care whom they are voting for, 
make sure everybody can vote. 
Because what happens when people 
are blocked from voting and voting 
drops off, people lose faith in their gov-
ernment. If we lose faith in our govern-
ment, we lose faith in our country. And 
if we lose faith in our country, this 
wonderful experiment in democracy— 
as some called it a couple hundred 
years ago—fails. 
We can’t have that. We can’t have 
that. So I look back on my 48 years 
here in the Senate, and I think it is not 
the title; it is not the chairmanships; it 
is not the President pro tem; it is not 
being dean of the Senate that I cherish, 
it is knowing that I can vote. I can 
vote. I have voted 17,000 times, more 
than that now. 
Can I go back over all those votes 
and find some where I might think, 
‘‘Gee, I should have voted differently,’’ 
of course, I can, but I voted. I can vote. 
And I call on my colleagues, vote up or 
down. I would hope that all of us would 
do as we have in the past, when I have 
been in the Senate, when we passed the 
Voting Rights Act 98 to zero. Repub-
lican Presidents were signing the Vot-
ing Rights Act. Let’s go back to that 
time. 
Vote any way you want in a Presi-
dential election. Vote any way you 
want in gubernatorial, congressional, 
in local elections, but in this body, this 
body, which should be the conscience of 
the Nation, vote to uphold the right to 
vote, vote to allow every American the 
ability to vote. 
Don’t hide behind procedure. Stand 
on the floor, have the courage and the 
honesty to say: I am going to vote to 
allow people to vote or I am going to 
vote not to allow people to vote. But 
stand here and say what you are going 
to do. The last time, 98 of us stood here 
and voted. We wanted everybody to 
vote. Republicans and Democrats, we 
joined together. 
Wouldn’t that send a wonderful sig-
nal to a fractured nation if we did that 
today and stood up and said: We are 
going to vote. We are all going to vote. 
We are going to vote yes or no, but we 
are going to let people of our State 
know how we voted. We are going to let 
the American people know how we 
voted and say why we voted. 
I would wish we voted as we did be-
fore to say to all Americans, Repub-
licans, Democrats, Independents, any 
part of this country: We want you to 
vote. We will urge you to vote the way 
we would like, but we want you to have 
the ability to vote, even if you are vot-
ing for our opponents or for a different 
point of view. 
The most important thing, as Ameri-
cans, as U.S. Senators, is to say we 
stand for the right of people to vote— 
every one of us, every single one of us. 
I will have more to say on this mat-
ter later. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING

The senior assistant legislative clerk

VOTING RIGHTS 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, yester-
day, we celebrated Martin Luther King, 
Jr., Day and honored civil rights lead-
ers who fought against inequality and 
sacrificed so much to move our country 
closer towards justice for all. But this 
year, on a day when we should be com-
ing together to commemorate these 
civil rights achievements and recom-
mit to the road ahead, we are instead 
fighting a battle we thought was won 
decades ago. 
In 1957, Martin Luther King, Jr., de-
livered his ‘‘Give Us the Ballot’’ ad-
dress, where he said: 
The denial of this sacred right is a tragic 
betrayal of the highest mandates of our 
democratic tradition. 
But here we are in 2022 fighting back 
against hundreds of bills introduced in 
States across the Nation clearly in-
tended to make it so much harder for 
certain people to vote. 
Twenty-two States have already en-
acted 47 new laws that make it more 
difficult to vote by mail, that make it 
harder to stay on voting lists, that 
limit the availability of drop boxes for 
ballots, that limit the number of poll-
ing locations, that impose stricter or 
newer voter ID requirements, and the 
list goes on. But one of the most insid-
ious is Georgia’s law which allows any 
person to challenge the rights of an un-
limited number of voters to cast their 
ballots. 
If someone decides for whatever rea-
son to challenge another person’s right 
to vote, the voter then has to show up 
to their election office to defend them-
selves. Imagine being a single mom 
working two jobs and unable to afford 
childcare, and now she has to defend 
her constitutional right just because 
someone thought she shouldn’t be vot-
ing at all. 
Volunteers are already being re-
cruited to pose these challenges. This 
isn’t voter protection; this is vigilan-
tism. These laws are clearly intended 
to target communities of color and 
make it harder for them to vote, pe-
riod. 
Our country’s legacy of racial dis-
crimination in voting is undeniable, 
and it is undeniable that we are wit-
nessing history repeat itself. 
In 1890, the House passed historic leg-
islation that would have increased vot-
ing protections, particularly for Black 
voters, but the Senate failed to take up 
this legislation, failed to act at a crit-
ical time when it had the chance, and 
the results were devastating for dec-
ades to come. The Senate’s failure to 
take up this legislation allowed Jim 
Crow and the plummeting of voter

turnout among Black voters to con-
tinue for more than half a century, 
until the Senate passed the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 over 70 years later. 
A recent Washington Post analysis 
said that this current wave of voter 
suppression bills potentially amounts 
to ‘‘the most sweeping contraction of 
ballot access in the United States since 
the end of Reconstruction.’’ 
Today, these attacks on our freedom 
to vote are taking us back to the time 
of Reconstruction. 
We cannot wait another 70 years for 
this so-called deliberative body to act, 
which is why we need to pass com-
prehensive voter protection legislation. 
But not a single Republican supports 
the Freedom to Vote: John Lewis Act. 
Many of my Republican colleagues 
have joined Congressman John Lewis 
to 
commemorate 
the 
March 
from 
Selma to Montgomery, but today they 
won’t even allow the Senate to con-
sider legislation named in his honor 
and have called this bill radical. There 
is nothing radical about protecting a 
person’s freedom to vote. What is rad-
ical is sending us back to the days of 
Reconstruction. 
This legislation would restore and 
strengthen the Voting Rights Act, 
which 
Congress 
reauthorized 
with 
broad bipartisan support five times— 
1970, 1975, 1982, 1992—and it passed 98 to 
0 in 2006, which included 10 currently 
sitting Senate Republicans. 
This bill would also expand opportu-
nities to vote, prevent voter suppres-
sion, and improve election security. We 
are 
talking 
about 
provisions 
that 
would require States to offer early vot-
ing and no-excuse vote-by-mail, make 
election day a public holiday, crack 
down on voter intimidation, and re-
quire postelection audits. Again, I ask, 
how is any of this radical? What is rad-
ical is justifying overt attacks on our 
democracy by perpetuating the Big Lie 
of mass voter fraud. 
For Republicans, this fight isn’t 
about election security; it is about se-
curing their power, because Repub-
licans have decided that spreading mis-
information and rigging elections by 
preventing people from voting is the 
only way they will retain their power. 
Republicans should come to the Sen-
ate floor and tell the American people 
why they won’t protect our freedom to 
vote. Instead, the Republican leader 
came to the floor to attack Democrats 
for fighting to change Senate rules to 
pass this critical legislation, calling it 
a power grab. 
The Republican leader said that 
Democrats want to ‘‘permanently dam-
age this institution.’’ He went on to 
say the filibuster is ‘‘about com-
promise and moderation’’—this from 
the Republican leader who refers to 
himself as the grim reaper as he pre-
vents dozens of House-passed bills from 
being considered on the Senate floor; 
the same person who singlehandedly 
prevented President Obama from fill-
ing a vacancy on the Supreme Court 
for over a year, denying the will of 
nearly 66 million Americans who voted 
to give President Obama a second term 
in office; the same person who pushed 
through President Trump’s Supreme 
Court nominee as over 159 million 
Americans were in the process of vot-
ing. So much for compromise and mod-
eration. 
Let’s not pretend this is about the 
sanctity of this institution. We cannot 
sit back and let one political party 
continue to unravel the threads of our 
democracy one voter suppression bill 
at a time. While Republicans do noth-
ing to protect our freedom to vote in 
the face of mass voter suppression bills 
enacted across the country, we Demo-
crats cannot sit back and let 2020 be 
the last free and fair election in our 
country. 
If we don’t protect the right to vote, 
we won’t have a democracy. It is that 
simple. That is the reality. Since the 
Republicans will not lift a finger to 
protect voting rights, we have no op-
tion but to change the Senate rules in 
order to pass the Freedom to Vote: 
John R. Lewis Act. This is something 
that every single Democratic Senator 
needs to get on board with. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

FILIBUSTER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, late 
last week, our Democratic colleagues 
briefly paused their quest to destroy 
the Senate’s 60-vote threshold just long 
enough to use the 60-vote threshold 
themselves to block a bill. 
Republicans supported sanctioning 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline that would 
give Russia even more leverage to 
bully Europe. Most of our Democratic 
colleagues bowed to the furious lob-
bying from the Biden administration to 
protect Putin’s pipeline. There were 55 
votes to pass the bill that our friends, 
like Ukrainian President Zelensky, 
desperately wanted passed, but Demo-
crats blocked it by denying 60. 
Now, many of these same colleagues 
have spent weeks thundering—literally 
thundering—that the Senate’s 60-vote 
threshold is an offensive tool of ob-
struction, a Jim Crow relic, declaring 
that simple majorities should always 
get their way. Ah, but late last week, 
they 
literally 
wielded 
the 
60-vote 
threshold 
themselves—a 
useful 
re-
minder of just how fake—fake—the 
hysteria has been. 
We already knew Washington Demo-
crats didn’t have any principled opposi-
tion to Senate rules. Democrats repeat-
edly filibustered the CARES Act in 
March of 2020, while insisting on 
changes. Democrats filibustered and 
killed Senator TIM SCOTT’s police re-
form bill. 
You only have to go back a few years 
to read vigorous defenses of the fili-
buster from our Democratic colleagues 
and their allies. 
The Democratic whip, Senator DUR-
BIN, put it this way: 
We need to protect the right of debate in 
the Senate, preserve checks and balances so 
that no one party can do whatever it wants. 
We need to preserve the voice of the minor-
ity in America. 
DICK DURBIN. 
The Democratic leader himself said 
in 2017 that we need to ‘‘find a way to 
build a firewall around the legislative 
filibuster’’—build a firewall around the 
legislative filibuster. 
Then, in a letter that same year by 32 
Senate Democrats, our colleagues de-
manded—demanded—that the 60-vote 
threshold stay right where it was. 
Until the last couple of years, Sen-
ators on both sides have understood 
the Senate is not here to rubberstamp 
massive changes by thin majorities. 
This institution exists to do exactly 
the opposite—to make sure major laws 
receive major buy-in and have major 
staying power, and, historically, Demo-
cratic allies outside this Chamber have 
recognized this as well. 
Let’s go back about 15 years ago 
when Republicans controlled the Sen-
ate. A leftwing organization called The 
Leadership Conference on Civil and 
Human Rights published a lengthy 
statement 
defending—defending—the 
filibuster, including—listen to this—its 
relationship to civil rights. 
Here is what they had to say when 
Republicans were in the majority here 
in the Senate: 
On behalf of the Leadership Conference on 
Civil Rights, the nation’s oldest, largest, and 
most diverse civil and human rights coali-
tion, with more than 180 member organiza-
tions, we urge you to oppose— 
oppose— 
any efforts to eliminate the 216-year-old fili-
buster in the United States Senate. 
That is a coalition of 180 member or-
ganizations 
called 
The 
Civil 
and 
Human Rights Coalition. 
They went on. 
The elimination of the rights of the minor-
ity as embodied by the filibuster is contrary 
to the founding fathers’ vision of the Senate 
as a body of equals designed to protect 
against the tyranny of the majority. 
This statement continued. 
The civil rights community has recognized 
and accepted the value— 
The value— 
of the filibuster even when it frustrated ef-
forts to advance civil rights legislative 
goals. During the 1950’s and 1960’s, countless 
civil rights bills were filibustered. The Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 was not passed until it 
survived 75 days of the longest filibuster in 
history and the Senate voted 71–29 to end de-
bate and finally passed the bill. This legisla-
tion was enacted because of long, hard work

to build support across partisan, ideological, 
and regional lines. We worked to bring 
Americans together—not to push them far-
ther apart. 
They concluded: 
We never demanded the end of the system 
of checks and balances. In the end, we won 
the battle by changing votes and not— 
Not— 
by breaking the rules. 
These were leftwing activists writing 
less than 20 years ago. 
So let’s spell this out. Democrats 
want the American people to believe 
the filibuster was not a Jim Crow relic 
in 2005; it was not even a Jim Crow 
relic in 2020; just miraculously became 
a Jim Crow relic in 2021; briefly 
stopped being a Jim Crow relic last 
Thursday, but it is now back to being a 
Jim Crow relic this week. 
Now, to be clear, the partisan elec-
tion takeover bills that Democrats 
want to ram through this week are 
not—not—in any way successors of the 
civil rights legislation from the mid- 
20th century. It has been, is today, and 
will remain illegal to discriminate 
against voters anywhere in America 
because of their race—period. That is 
the law now. 
Targeting Americans’ online speech 
and sending government money to po-
litical campaigns is not about civil 
rights. It is about tilting the playing 
field. Weakening wildly popular voter 
ID laws and making it harder to 
produce accurate voter rolls is not 
about making voting easier; it is about 
making cheating easier. Changing the 
laws so that our partisan Attorney 
General can rewrite voting laws with-
out even having to win in court is not 
about promoting justice; it is about 
short-circuiting justice. This is about 
one party wanting the power to unilat-
erally rewrite the rule book of Amer-
ican elections. 
Now, interestingly, the Biden admin-
istration staff has gone out of its way 
lately 
to 
highlight 
my—my—long, 
strong record on real civil rights and 
real voting rights. The President’s 
Press Secretary explained that I have 
‘‘a pretty strong record of supporting 
voting rights.’’ She is right about that. 
And that is exactly why I have no pa-
tience—none—for the unrelated par-
tisan takeover that some Democrats 
are trying to rebrand with that banner. 
The Democratic leader argues that 
his proposed elections takeover and his 
efforts to break the Senate are last re-
sorts because of new State laws that 
passed in 2021. He says it is irrelevant 
that 2020 saw record turnout and—lis-
ten to this—94 percent said voting was 
easy because this debate is exclusively 
about what happened in 2021. But 
Democrats have been pushing these 
same policy charges in the same Chick-
en Little rhetoric since 2019, a year and 
a half before 2020 election, which 
Democrats now call a high-turnout 
success. 
The Democratic leader gave an inter-
view claiming that evil Republicans 
were trying to attack voting and dis-
enfranchise people. Of course, when 
Democrats went on to win the White 
House, the 2020 election went from pre-
sumptively illegitimate to exemplary 
and unquestionable overnight. Around 
the same time, mid-2019, Senator SCHU-
MER began floating a nuclear attack on 
Senate 
rules. 
It 
is 
completely 
untethered from the elections issue. He 
just thought breaking the rules would 
make for a livelier stint as majority 
leader. 
Washington Democrats have wanted 
the power to rewrite the rules for polit-
ical speech and election laws long, long 
before the events that are supposed to 
justify it, and the Democratic leader’s 
effort to break the Senate long pre-
dates the latest pretext. 
We have strong disagreements about 
the substance of these bills, but, even 
more broadly, we see decreasing trust 
in our democracy among both political 
sides. We have a sitting President of 
the United States shouting that U.S. 
Senators are on the side of Bull Connor 
and Jefferson Davis for refusing to 
shatter the Senate. 
Was the Senate created to make 
these kinds of factional fevers worse or 
to help break the fevers? Does the Sen-
ate exist to help narrow majorities 
double down on divisions or to force 
broad coalitions to build bridges? 
This fake hysteria does not prove the 
Senate is obsolete. It proves the Senate 
is as necessary as ever. 
Republicans have supported this lim-
itation on the majority’s power both 
when we have been in the minority, 
which these rules protect, and when we 
have been the majority, which they in-
convenience. 
And last week, some of our col-
leagues across the aisle reconfirmed 
that they have the courage and the 
principle to keep their word and to pro-
tect the institution as well. But too 
many of our colleagues across the aisle 
still want to respond to a 50–50 Senate 
with a rule-breaking power grab. 
Voting to break this institution will 
not be a free vote or a harmless action, 
even if their effort fails. An unprinci-
pled attempt at grabbing power is not 
harmless just because it fails. Voting 
to break the Senate is not cost-free 
just because a bipartisan majority of 
your colleagues have the wisdom to 
stop you. It is amazing that our col-
leagues are this in thrall to radical ac-
tivists. 
We have inflation, a pandemic, ramp-
ant violent crime, a border crisis, and 
possibly a war on the European con-
tinent. But rather than work on any of 
that, Senate Democrats want to march 
their own legacies with a reckless— 
reckless—procedural vote they know 
will fail. A faction this desperate for 
unlimited short-term power is a faction 
that must be denied it.

OFFICER

The

H.R. 5746 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
care about the future of this institu-
tion, but right now, I care more about 
the future of our democracy. Our coun-
try has been the bedrock for democ-
racies around the world. It has been 
the gold standard by which other coun-
tries wishing to achieve transparency 
and validation of their governments, 
have asked us to come and witness 
their elections. 
Let’s not forget what is great about a 
democracy. The power rests with the 
people. And when you have an election, 
it is the people who have spoken. 
So whether it was F.D.R. and the 
New Deal, or Ronald Reagan declaring 
‘‘Morning in America,’’ the people had 
spoken, and the country went about 
the change that was implemented be-
cause of free and fair elections. 
Trust me, there are countries who 
are jealous of this. They obviously run 
their countries by other means. They 
are less stable, and they are less egali-
tarian. And yet, if we think of the 
many great advantages of a democracy, 
nothing says it better than the people 
have spoken. 
Yet now, we have a former President 
of the United States, Donald Trump, 
who has dared to say and continues to 
say the people haven’t spoken. Donald 
Trump is not just like the guy at a 
football game who doesn’t like the ref-
eree’s calls. Donald Trump has taken it 
to a whole new level of basically, with-
out evidence, saying his team didn’t 
lose the game. 
Can you imagine an NFL or college 
football structure where the coach 
says, ‘‘I don’t like the ref’s call. My 
team didn’t lose the game. And I’m 
going to spend the rest of my time 
going, marching around to every foot-
ball game and every community saying 
my team didn’t lose the game.’’ 
Well, thank God college and profes-
sional coaches know better. They don’t 
do this. And yet former President 
Trump keeps saying, I don’t like the 
call of election officials, judges, Fed-
eral courts, never mind there were 60 
decisions by different courts. I am 
going to protest the outcome of this 
election. 
Never in the history of our country 
do I know a major race where someone 
declared they really didn’t lose. What 
if everybody went around saying, I 
really didn’t lose? What if our system 
of governments would be affected by 
that? 
Well, it is getting to that level of ab-
surdity. The Republican nominee in 
the 
2020 
Washington 
gubernatorial 
election lost by over 600,000 votes. Yet 
he claimed voter fraud. He lost by 56– 
43. And even though he lost by such a 
huge margin, he claimed voter fraud. 
He sued the secretary of state, who 
happened to be a Republican, in King 
County 
Superior 
Court. 
He 
only 
dropped the election fraud lawsuit 
after the court threatened his lawyer 
with making meritless claims. 
Do we really understand this danger, 
the danger of people in our country, to

our economy, to our way of life if these 
falsehoods continue? We are not here, 
though, just because a former Presi-
dent cannot accept an election loss. He 
began sowing these seeds of distrust 
into our election system the minute he 
stepped onto the national stage. 
We are here because the problem has 
become so serious that people are now 
trying to disenfranchise the voting 
rights of our fellow Americans. Some 
voter suppression tactics are being put 
in place because some believe the 
former President did not like the out-
come of the election. 
I want to be clear. There are people 
on both sides of the aisle that do be-
lieve in free and fair elections. There 
are Republicans in key election posi-
tions who stood up to the illegal tac-
tics of the President when he tried to 
change the outcome of the last elec-
tion. But what our country can’t afford 
right 
now 
is 
the 
continuation 
of 
Trump-think to allow to erode the vot-
ing rights of our fellow Americans. 
Voting rights have been hard fought 
and hard won. I know the President 
presiding understands this—first by 
women in 1920, then, later, protecting 
minority groups in 1965 with the Vot-
ing Rights Act. In 1970, we updated it, 
making standards helping to regulate 
Presidential elections—in 1975, saying 
we had to protect minorities. Both 
sides of the aisle agreed to this. And in 
1992, we expanded it for bilingual edu-
cation requirements. That passed with 
75–20 votes. And again in 2006, the last 
time the voting rights was updated, we 
were in a similar situation. The Su-
preme Court had two cases and struck 
down part of the act, and we all came 
together to renew and reaffirm the con-
stitutional protections for people in 
the United States of America. It passed 
98–0. 
There is nothing wrong with the 
John Lewis Voting Rights law before 
us. There is nothing wrong with the 
John Lewis Voting Rights law before

It is a bill with bipartisan support 
that tries to maintain, I think, a Fed-
eral minimum assurance that States 
don’t suppress the rights of our fellow 
Americans. When Martin Luther King 
was fighting this fight, he said, ‘‘one 
man, one vote.’’ He knew that this was 
about making sure that everybody had 
a chance to vote. 
The John Lewis Act is a continuation 
of those rights in upgrading something 
that 
has 
been 
upgraded 
numerous 
times since 1965. That is why my col-
leagues Senator MANCHIN
and MUR-
KOWSKI called for bipartisan reauthor-
ization of the Voting Rights Act, a bi-
partisan call for reauthorization last 
spring of the Voting Rights Act. They 
said, ‘‘Inaction is not an option.’’ They 
continued to say, ‘‘Congress must come 
together just as we have done in the 
past time and time again to reaffirm 
our long-standing bipartisan commit-
ment to free, accessible, and secure 
elections.’’ 
And that is what we must do now. 
That is why there are 150 businesses 
who support the John Lewis Act—com-
panies like Microsoft and Google, Intel 
and Tesla, Target, PayPal. These are 
companies who know and understand, 
they want to do business in a democ-
racy. As Tim Cook said, the right to 
vote is fundamental to our democracy. 
American history is a story of ex-
panding the right to vote to all citi-
zens, and Black people in particular 
have had to march, struggle, and even 
give their lives for more than a century 
to defend that right, and we support ef-
forts to ensure that our democracy and 
our future is more hopeful and inclu-
sive than the past. 
There are others—Best Buy—an elec-
tion cannot be free or fair if every eli-
gible voter is not given a fair chance to 
vote or if the law makes it harder to do 
so. 
Now, I disagree with my colleague 
who was just on the floor because there 
is a lot of demeaning of the system. I 
am not going to spend a lot of time on 
this now because I have another seg-
ment here on the floor later, but I 
come from a vote-by-mail State, and I 
am proud of what our State has accom-
plished. So I do not appreciate the 
disinformation of Newt Gingrich when 
he says, ‘‘The biggest way with to ex-
pand voter fraud is to expand vote-by- 
mail.’’ 
He is wrong. If I could slash a red line 
and a red circle through this now, I 
would do so. But I will spend many 
minutes later on the floor talking to 
people why vote-by-mail is part of the 
solution and not the threat that he 
thinks it is. 
Companies know that when it comes 
to our economy, we are greatly aided 
by being in a democracy, and that is 
why they don’t want it eroded. It will 
cost us if we are a less stable place to 
do business. So why now do people 
refuse to engage on the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act? 
You know, I might be one of those 
people who would say, ‘‘Don’t change 
the filibuster rule, we can wait.’’ 
Wait? Wait? For what? What are we 
waiting for? Our Capitol was attacked. 
We were attacked. People defending us 
were killed. For what? For what? A big 
lie, a big lie about our election. 
I sat outside the Capitol on January 
6 and listened to the President telling 
these lies I knew weren’t true. I knew 
what he said wasn’t correct about our 
voting laws because I know and under-
stand them, and I certainly know vote- 
by-mail. But he said many lies that 
now many court decisions have all said 
are not true. 
But the point is that Donald Trump 
and his followers keep following and 
they tell the people the election wasn’t 
fairly decided, and now, they are trying 
to pass State laws eroding our con-
stitutional rights to protect every 
American’s ability to vote, and some 
here don’t want to act. 
Our democracy is under threat, and 
people are trying to undermine the 
credibility of our elections, and you 
don’t want to act. Trump supporters 
are literally trying to hoist a Jolly 
Roger flag over our democracy because 
they lost the election, and some people 
don’t want to act. Some percentage of 
the Republican Party now believe that 
the election was wrongly decided, and 
some people don’t want to act. 
We have to have faith in close elec-
tions, and the best way to do that is 
not to suppress the vote but encourage 
and empower more people to vote in a 
safe and secure manner. We need to be-
lieve in our voting system, not believe 
that we can undermine it. 
Democracies don’t grow on trees. 
They need to be protected. They need 
to be defended. They need to be fought 
for. And with all the challenges we are 
facing—COVID, a changing economy in 
an information age, global migration, 
climate change—I am getting too many 
questions from my constituents about 
whether we are becoming a fascist na-
tion. 
Why am I answering those questions? 
Because Trump told a big lie and he 
got people to attack our Capitol and 
now he is ramping up fear and anxiety 
to the point where locals are changing 
their election laws and eroding our de-
mocracy? No, I can’t stand by. I will 
vote to proceed and change. I will not 
stand by because my parents taught 
me better. 
My father fought in World War II and 
reminded me constantly when I was 
growing up that if someone’s rights 
were eroded, you better stand up be-
cause if you don’t, they are coming 
after your rights next. And a threat to 
one was a threat to all. 
My mom worked at the polls on elec-
tion day. When she was a child, she 
played in her backyard and met an Af-
rican-American woman who became 
her friend. When election day rolled 
around, my mom noticed that her 
friend had to wait outside in the cold 
to vote, where the White voters got to 
go inside and wait. My mom took her 
friend by the hand inside the polling 
place and said, ‘‘My friend’s not wait-
ing outside.’’ 
It earned my mom the nickname 
‘‘Little Eleanor’’ after the First Lady 
of the period. 
What might seem surprising is how 
much my mom liked her fellow Repub-
lican precinct committeemen. She felt 
like they were on the same team— 
Team Democracy: people who got the 
vote out. They may not agree on who 
they were voting for, but they agreed 
people should vote. And they were will-
ing to live with the consequences. And 
believe me, my parents had a lot of—a 
lot of things that they had to keep 
fighting for, but they believed in de-
mocracy. 
I remember my mom saying how un-
easy she felt when she realized her 
friends and neighbors, seeing the re-
sults of her precinct, didn’t support 
John Kennedy for President of the 
United States. 
My parents were crushed when John 
Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, and Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., were all as-
sassinated, but they never lost faith in

the system, and they never said the 
system was rigged. 
What we need to do now is to protect 
our democracy. We need to pass the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act. We 
need to say, as Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., said, that one man, one vote is 
what our country stands for, and it is 
the strength of our Nation. 
One thing about January 6 that both-
ers me the most—it bothers me the 
most because I think about my father 
and his brother. My father quit high 
school to fight in World War II because 
his brother was already missing or in a 
POW camp. He knew he had to join the 
fight against the oppressions, the tyr-
anny, the fascism that existed. He 
knew he had to join the fight to uphold 
the democracy of the United States. 
This is a picture of what it looked 
like to be escorted back into this 
chamber on January 6. All I could 
think of when I saw this picture is, ob-
viously, yes, support and gratitude for 
the military who supported us. But all 
I could think about was my father and 
his brother who fought in World War II 
for these rights, to uphold a democ-
racy, so that I could stand for election 
and that my friends and neighbors 
could vote for me, and then I would 
come here in an environment where I 
was free to walk into the Capitol at 
any moment and cast a vote on behalf 
of the people that I represent. 
And yet, on one fateful day, that all 
changed. And we were no different than 
some other country who had to use 
military force to support our democ-
racy here in voting. That is not the 
way it is supposed to be. That is not 
what we are fighting for. Many Ameri-
cans have fought to uphold the democ-
racies of our Nation. The least we 
could do is pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. The least we could do is 
work in a mission together to pass the 
John Lewis Voting Rights Act and 
show that our country believes in hold-
ing these important values of a democ-
racy as utmost important. Let’s vote 
to get this done. Let’s move forward to 
show our country we believe in voting 
rights in the U.S Senate. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
Democrats have shamelessly alleged 
that a massive Federal takeover of 
elections is needed because of ques-
tions some Republicans raised after the 
2020 election, so I come to the floor 
today to show that this whole argu-
ment predates the 2020 election. 
(Mr. BOOKER assumed the Chair.) 
This Democrat reasoning is despite 
the fact that their proposal predates 
the 2020 election. The bill that they 
want us to pass is a product of concerns 
that the Democrats had about the 2016 
election being stolen from Hillary Clin-
ton—also because of the 2018 elections. 
And, in fact, the Democrat proposal 
was designed specifically to double 
down on false claims that Democrats 
lost certain elections in 2018 only be-
cause of rigged elections. 
I have said it before, and I want to 
say it again: Evidence-free claims of 
voter suppression are as bad as elec-
tion-free claims of voter fraud. Both 
voter fraud and discrimination in vot-
ing is illegal. Any claim of voter fraud 
or violation of voting rights should be 
resolved in our independent court sys-
tem with evidence that can stand up in 
the courts. 
And as I have mentioned before, the 
claims by some Trump supporters that 
a certain brand of voting machine- 
switched votes was lifted entirely from 
the Democrats’ 2004 playbook. And you 
may remember that Democrat House 
Members challenged the electoral vote 
count of whether George W. Bush was 
officially and honestly reelected. And 
President Trump’s questioning of his 
loss in Georgia was simply following in 
the footsteps of the losing Democrat 
candidate for Governor of that State 
just 2 years before who lost by a much 
bigger margin and never admitted that 
defeat. 
That makes me wonder if Democrats’ 
professed outrage comes from a sincere 
concern for Democratic reforms or if 
they are just upset that President 
Trump stole their playbook. 
If Democrats really want to preserve 
Democratic norms, they would not be 
proposing 
the 
Federal 
Government 
overturning the current electoral proc-
ess in all 50 States, on a purely par-
tisan basis, with no attempt to even 
hear out Republicans’ legitimate con-
cerns. 
The bills that we are talking about 
this week are being called democracy 
reform. Does democracy need reform? I 
support the American democratic sys-
tem. It does not need a fundamental re-
write. The 240-year history of our great 
country under this Constitution ought 
to support that. It works, and it de-
serves our support. We should not deni-
grate American democracy for short- 
term political gain. 
President Trump’s candidacy in 2016 
brought many Americans to the polls 
who had not voted recently, and there 
was a record turnout. In 2020, turnout 
broke the record yet again, both for 
the Republican Party and the Demo-
cratic Party, and President Biden won 
that election. 
In the 2021 election, there were un-
usually high turnouts for off-year elec-
tions to the benefit of Republicans and 
conservatives. You saw that, particu-
larly in the State of Virginia, where 
the Republican candidates statewide 
were victorious, and you saw some sur-
prising 
turnouts 
of 
opposition 
to 
Democrats who were reelected in the 
State of New Jersey. 
Democrats accuse Republicans of 
wanting to keep people from voting. 
Why would we want to keep people 
from voting when we have been very 
successful in many large turnout elec-
tions very recently? 
Plus, have you seen the polls today 
that show dissatisfaction with Demo-
crats—a Republican deficit of five or 
seven points last year, with positive 
Republican versus Democrat polls this 
year. 
So we ought to stop casting doubt 
about American elections, stop casting 
aspersions on commonsense election 
security measures like ID, supported 
by overwhelming numbers of Ameri-
cans of all backgrounds. And by ‘‘all 
backgrounds,’’ I mean even people 
whom we classify as minorities. 
Let’s work together to boost the con-
fidence of all Americans in our elec-
tions. Let’s start rejecting claims that 
the only way the other party can win is 
by rigging elections. Let’s retire the 
short-term strategy of falsely claiming 
that one of the two parties is a threat 
to democracy. That, in and of itself, is 
a very undemocratic position to take. 
This kind of rhetoric damages civil so-
ciety and erodes faith in our democ-
racy. For the sake of our country, 
please stop it. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when 
Democrats last had the majority and 
proposed blowing up the Senate rules 
and the historic way that the Senate 
has worked, I gave a series of speeches 
explaining how the father of the Con-
stitution, James Madison, intended for 
the Senate to be a deliberative body; in 
other words, a break on the hot pas-
sions that occur in the House of Rep-
resentatives. I repeated my deeply held 
opposition to gutting the Senate proc-
ess, even when my party took control 
of all three branches—and it would 
have been politically expedient in the 
short term. 
I don’t know how many times Presi-
dent Trump brought up doing away 
with what we call the filibuster or the 
60-vote requirement. It was even fol-
lowed by a lot of our Republican Party 
grassroots wanting to overcome Demo-
crats’ use of the cloture rule to block 
the Republican agenda during those 4 
years. But I spoke out strongly against 
it. 
In 2017, over half of the current Dem-
ocrat Senators signed a letter calling 
for preservation of the current rules re-
quiring the 60 votes to stop debate for 
considering the legislation, despite the 
use of the nuclear option for nominees. 
I agree with President Biden’s posi-
tion in 2005. Reflecting on the same un-
derstanding that I have of the Con-
stitution and the role of the Senate as 
envisioned by James Madison, then- 
Senator Biden said this: 
That is the . . . reason . . . we have the 
. . . rule. So when one party . . . controls all 
levers of Government, one man or one 
woman can stand on the floor of the Senate 
and resist . . . the passions of the moment. 
Even Senator SCHUMER, the majority 
leader, said, at that time, gutting the 
cloture rule would be a ‘‘doomsday for 
democracy’’—doomsday for democracy. 
Now it seems like Senator SCHUMER in-
vites that doomsday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S237 
January 18, 2022 
Senator DURBIN hit the nail on the 
head as recently as 2018, saying it 
‘‘would be the end of the Senate as it 
was originally devised and created 
going back to our Founding Fathers.’’ I 
agreed then, and I agree now. 
Now the shoe is on the other foot, 
and Democrats have changed their po-
sition, many not for the first time. 
Senator DURBIN has now joined the 
crusade of his Democratic predecessor, 
Stephen Douglas, of Illinois—famous 
for debating Abraham Lincoln on the 
issues of slavery. But that Douglas 
from Illinois also proposed a Senate 
rule change allowing a narrow major-
ity to force a final vote on bills. 
Hypocrisy is not rare in politics on 
both sides of the aisle, but the fact 
that Democrats switched principles on 
such a consequential matter whenever 
Senate control changes from one party 
to the other is particularly glaring. 
The party of Jim Crow, which made 
liberal use of so-called filibuster just 
over a year ago to block Republicans’ 
agenda, are now saying, falsely, it is a 
relic of Jim Crow. 
I do not see how they can look the 
voters in the eyes with no sign of em-
barrassment. I do not understand why 
the policemen of our governmental sys-
tem—the media—isn’t roasting them 
for this hypocritical power grab. 
I would now like to address a mis-
conception on the cloture motion, the 
60-vote requirement. The cloture mo-
tion requires 60 votes to bring consider-
ation of legislation to finality. Just be-
cause it can be used to block legisla-
tion, does not mean that the term ‘‘clo-
ture’’ always equals a filibuster. 
Cloture cuts off not just debate but 
the offering of amendments. Voting for 
cloture, also, is saying that the Senate 
has voted on enough amendments. Sen-
ators who have amendments important 
to their State that they want to offer 
should be voting against cloture to pre-
serve their right to offer amendments, 
as their constituents might desire. De-
bate and amendments are the hallmark 
of this democracy, not an obstacle to 
be swept aside in pursuit of a short- 
term partisan agenda. 
When Democrats last controlled the 
Senate with 60 votes and thereafter, 
amendment votes became very rare. 
Even rank-and-file Democrats lost op-
portunities to represent their States 
with amendments important to that 
State. 
Let’s look at the cloture issue an-
other way. Also, many people confuse 
debate over filibuster with talking non-
stop to delay. That is a kind of ‘‘Mr. 
Smith 
Goes 
to 
Washington’’ 
fili-
buster—the famous movie, you know. 
This has nothing to do with cloture. 
People who talk about returning to the 
so-called talking filibuster are con-
fusing two different Senate rules, both 
called filibuster. 
Senators have never had to talk until 
they dropped from exhaustion to pre-
serve their right to amend bills. So the 
talking filibuster rhetoric is nonsense. 
Democrats have convinced themselves 
or at least their activist base—and 
done it falsely—that our democracy is 
in crisis. And so it is absurd to say only 
one party, unilateral governance, can 
save democracy. But once an exception 
is made—and they are talking about 
that exception just for this voting 
rights bill, but once an exception is 
made to the right of all Senators to de-
bate and to amend legislation, there 
seems to be no going back. 
Democrats learned that in 2013, when 
they accomplished the 60-vote require-
ment on district and circuit court 
judges, and they lived to regret it 4 
years later when Republicans did the 
same thing when we had a Supreme 
Court Justice up. It is a slippery slope 
that you should not let come about. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Would the Senator 
from Iowa yield for a question? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I will. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you very 
much. 
First, thank you for coming to the 
floor to debate such an important issue 
as how to make the Senate work well 
as a deliberative body and how to make 
our country work well. 
I was struck by a couple of things 
that you mentioned, and that is that 
you had stood strong fast against strik-
ing down the filibuster, and you noted 
how consistent you were. But you also 
criticized Democrats for changing posi-
tion. 
But can you help my memory out on 
this, because did you not vote to strike 
down the filibuster on Supreme Court 
nominations? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. 
Mr. MERKLEY. So you changed your 
position, as well you would concede, 
since previously you had opposed get-
ting rid of the filibuster? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Remember what I 
said, and I just said this. So you obvi-
ously heard me. We warned, in 2013, 
when I think all Republicans voted 
against reducing the 60-vote threshold 
for district court and circuit court 
judges, so you could pack the DC Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals, that you would 
regret that, and you have regretted it 
because Republicans were saying in 
2017: What is good for the goose is good 
for the gander. And we voted to reduce 
it then for a Supreme Court Justice. 
Now, I am sure that, from your point 
of view, you have a Supreme Court 
that is not very favorable to what you 
think a Supreme Court ought to be 
doing, with the three people that 
Trump put on there. So that is where I 
am coming from. 
Mr. MERKLEY. I do appreciate your 
response, and it is so rare that we actu-
ally have any dialogue on the floor of 
the Senate. It is one of the things we 
lost. 
I do recall in that moment that, for 
over a year, we had working groups 
trying to resolve the extraordinary 
level—the new level—of cloture mo-
tions on President Obama’s nomina-
tions. It concluded in a meeting in the 
Old Senate Chamber where the agree-
ment was reached to stop doing that. 
And then, as you point out, MITCH 
MCCONNELL came to the floor and said: 
It doesn’t matter the quality of the in-
dividual who is nominated. I will not 
let any judge be considered for these 
three vacancies. 
That is a completely unprecedented 
new element that is brought in to bear 
on that particular conversation. That 
is just to, kind of, illuminate some of 
the details that were left out. 
I was struck by another thing you 
said, which is that the filibuster is not 
a relic of Jim Crow. I was struck about 
that because from 1891 through 1965—so 
we are talking over 80 years—the only 
thing that was blocked in the U.S. Sen-
ate by filibuster was civil rights for 
Black Americans. Given that, wouldn’t 
you say it is fair for us to say that the 
filibuster in that history was, indeed, a 
relic of Jim Crow? 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Do you know who 
held the Senate during that period of 
time on the issue you brought up? It 
was Democratic Senators from the 
South. 
Remember 
when 
the 
Civil 
Rights Act, in 1965, was passed, that 
there was a higher share—a higher per-
centage—of Republicans than Demo-
crats that voted for it. The one person 
that made a difference in getting the 
Civil Rights Act passed was Senator 
Dirksen, the Republican leader. 
I am going to have to end this discus-
sion with you, but I want to say one 
thing. Why would you want to expand 
this precedent that is set by Democrats 
into legislation and weaken bipartisan-
ship? That is where you have to leave 
it. It is a slippery slope. You may in-
tend to do it just for a voting rights 
act, but it is going to go further. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you for an-
swering and responding to my ques-
tions. I appreciate that. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I 
think I will start just by returning to 
the 1800s and a Senator from Massachu-
setts, Senator Sumner. Senator Sum-
ner later played a key role in the civil 
rights debate, which is why I am re-
turning to that story. I think it is a 
story about the Senate floor. 
Sumner gave a speech about Kansas 
being admitted into the Union, and he 
was a Republican Senator who called 
out two Democratic Senators, insult-
ing one of them. And a Representative 
from the House of Representatives, on 
the other end of this corridor, came 
over here. His name was Preston 
Brooks, and he took considerable of-
fense, and he proceeded to come to the 
Senate floor and cane Senator Sumner. 
Senator Sumner was gravely injured, 
but he did recover—recovering slowly. 
He served for another 18 years, which 
leads me to the fact that he proceeded 
to put forward civil rights legislation 
in 1875—in 1875—150 years ago—almost 
150 years ago, 145 years ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S238 
January 18, 2022 
And so he argued after the Civil War 
that our Black Americans were being 
discriminated against and it needed to 
end; that anyone should go into any 
public accommodation and be treated 
equally here in the United States of 
America—a Constitution that says: All 
men—and let’s include women—are cre-
ated equally. 
So he put forward this bill, and it 
said that every person gets equal ac-
cess to theaters, to public schools, to 
churches, to cemeteries, equal oppor-
tunity to serve in jury duty, and that 
any suits brought in this regard would 
be tried in Federal court, not State 
court, so we could enforce a Federal 
standard of nondiscrimination across 
this land. 
Sumner died of a heart attack in 
1874. He had put forward this originally 
as an amendment—actually, an intro-
duction in 1870, as a bill. He died before 
it could be passed. As he was dying, he 
pleaded with Frederick Douglass and 
others at his bedside: You must take 
care of my civil rights bill. 
In the months following his death, 
the Senate did act, and they supported 
that bill, and it was passed into law in 
1875. At that moment, it would be hard 
to envision that, after I was born, we 
would still be fighting for equal access 
to public accommodations. The Senate 
passed that bill and made it into law in 
1875. But the Supreme Court of the 
United States struck down that law 8 
years later. Boom—equal access in 
America supported by the elected Rep-
resentatives in the House and the Sen-
ate was blown to smithereens by a Su-
preme Court of the United States of 
America. 
Well, that did set the stage for an-
other civil rights battle, and it was 
1890. It was after Benjamin Harrison’s 
successful Presidential campaign, in 
which he promised election reform and 
election integrity because, you see, 
anyone looking at our Republic would 
know that we are all affected, no mat-
ter what State we come from, by the 
integrity of the elections in the other 
States. There has to be integrity in all 
of them for this U.S. Senate to have in-
tegrity. There has to be integrity in all 
of the State elections for that House of 
Representatives down the hall to have 
integrity. 
So Benjamin Harrison was elected 
campaigning on this type of reform. 
And there was a Senator, Senator 
George Hoar, who championed amend-
ments or an attempt to bolster na-
tional protections for Federal elec-
tions. It was particularly targeted at 
stopping voter suppression that had 
really arisen in the southern part of 
the United States following the Civil 
War. So this bill, known commonly as 
the Lodge bill, also known as the fed-
eral elections bill, passed the House of 
Representatives in 1890. 
What did this bill do? It allowed citi-
zens from any district to petition a 
Federal circuit court to appoint Fed-
eral supervisors for congressional elec-
tions in case of efforts to suppress the 
vote by local officials. It permitted the 
Federal Government to appoint super-
visors to oversee all phases of Federal 
elections, including voter registration 
and the certification of the election re-
sults to make sure there were no she-
nanigans at the State level that would 
corrupt the core vision of equal rep-
resentation, the core foundation of in-
tegrity of elections. It is the founda-
tion of the vision of the legitimacy and 
the production of government of, by, 
and for the people. 
And this bill even enabled Federal 
election supervisors to request deputy 
U.S. marshals, as necessary, to protect 
the ballot box for every citizen to have 
access. It passed the House of Rep-
resentatives, and it came here to the 
Senate, and it failed because they 
couldn’t get unanimous consent to 
close debate. At that time, there was 
no cloture motion. 
The Senators, in 1805, had gotten rid 
of the prior question rule, which would 
have allowed debate to be closed be-
cause they had a social contract. That 
social contract was that we listen to 
everyone to get their perspectives. Peo-
ple can speak, not once, but twice on a 
question. They can speak for as long 
we wanted to listen to everyone and 
then we take a vote. That was the so-
cial contract. 
But this filibuster broke that social 
contract because everyone was listened 
to, but you couldn’t get unanimous 
consent to close debate and so the bill 
died. It had the support of the people of 
the United States of America through 
their elected representatives down the 
hall. It had the support of this Senate 
to protect the fundamental right to 
vote in our Nation by the majority of 
this body here in the U.S. Senate. But 
the social contract was broken to block 
Black Americans from voting; to allow 
States and local election officials to 
rig the registration system so you 
could never sign up; to allow intimida-
tors to gather at the polls to keep 
Black Americans from getting through 
them to put their ballot in the box. 
I would like to say that all traces of 
inequality in voting are gone from 
America. I would like to say that. And, 
indeed, that was reasonably true—rea-
sonably 
true—through 
the 
recent 
years, before the Supreme Court gutted 
the Voting Rights Act, because any 
changes in your voting rules had to be 
preapproved in States that engaged in 
these intimidating practice. I say ‘‘rea-
sonably true’’ because the real fact is 
there was still a significant blemish in 
our elections, and that is, on election 
day, in certain States and certain pre-
cincts, there was a game being played 
to make it harder for some citizens to 
vote than other citizens to vote. 
The game worked like this: If you 
have an area where you want low turn-
out, you proceed to create a big pre-
cinct so that there are a lot of people 
who have to go to that one place to 
vote. And if you have a desire to en-
courage the people in another precinct 
to vote, a White precinct, you create 
smaller precincts so the voting line 
won’t be as long. 
And then there were other tricks 
like, for example, understaffing the 
voting precinct where it is predomi-
nantly Black Americans to make it 
harder for them to vote and making 
sure you staff really well the precinct 
where you want the White Americans 
to vote. 
And there were other tricks, as well. 
For example, relocating the voting lo-
cation in the Black precinct so that 
people go to the wrong place, or put-
ting it where parking is virtually im-
possible so it is much harder to get to 
the poll, or putting out false informa-
tion about the date and the location of 
the voting. 
These things are all wrong. Voter 
suppression exists today. And it was 
powerful to see how a couple tools have 
greatly reduced those tricks and traps. 
One of those tools is early voting. If 
you have an early voting period, it is 
hard to create long lines. It is hard to 
sustain wrong information about where 
to go. It is very difficult to deny people 
the ability to vote simply by having 
too few staffers. 
Even more so, vote-by-mail is power-
ful. Now, we have Republican States 
like Utah that have vote-by-mail, and 
they love it. And it elects Republicans. 
You have more blue States like Oregon 
that have vote-by-mail, and they love 
it. That is my home State. 
I was really struck, when I was first 
running for the Oregon State Legisla-
ture—it was 1998, and we still voted at 
the precincts’ voting polls, except the 
Republican Party had said: We can in-
crease turnout if we get all the Repub-
licans to sign up for absentee ballots. 
So they got a high percentage of Re-
publicans to sign up for absentee bal-
lots. Then the Democrats said: Well, 
OK, yes, we can get Democrats to sign 
up for absentee ballots. So 50 percent of 
the electorate in 1998 in Oregon was 
voting by mail and 50 percent, polls. 
As I went door to door in my first 
race for the Oregon House and asked 
people what they liked and didn’t like, 
they normally said: What I really hate 
is that we have too many potholes, and 
I am not happy with city hall. What I 
really like is my absentee ballot. 
I would say: Well, why is that? 
They would say: Well, you know, I 
don’t have to worry about where to 
park, and I don’t have to worry about 
long lines. Do you know what else? It 
is a complicated set of issues under the 
initiative system we have in Oregon, 
and I can be able to sit at my table, 
study them, discuss them with my 
spouse, and have my children come to 
the table and see what we are doing. 
Well, these two tools really opened 
the doors to the election process in the 
last election, and the response of my 
Republican colleagues was: Oh, no, we 
can’t let that happen. We don’t want 
those people to vote. We better rein in 
vote-by-mail. We better rein in voter 
registration.

runoff because 70,000-plus Georgians 
registered in that period, and they 
think it helped Democrats more than 
Republicans. So, in a prejudicial way, 
they said: Let’s make registration 
harder. 
Well, it is not acceptable in our coun-
try to erect barriers for targeted com-
munities—not for Black Americans, 
not for Hispanic Americans, not for 
college students, not for young voters, 
and not for Native American reserva-
tions—not for anyone. 
But why are those groups being tar-
geted in a surgical way by the strate-
gies in State after State after State 
with Republican legislatures and Re-
publican 
Governors? 
Because 
those 
constituencies tend to vote more often 
for Democrats than Republicans. So 
they are stealing the vote of millions 
of Americans. They are corrupting the 
election process for millions of Ameri-
cans. 
We stand here today in the Senate 
with the same issue we were debating 
in 1890 and 1891. The House had set na-
tional standards so every American 
could vote, and the Senate would not 
give unanimous consent to get to a 
final vote and contributed to eight-plus 
decades of discrimination in our coun-
try, of corrupted elections in our coun-
try—until the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
I see a colleague here preparing to 
speak, and I haven’t even begun my 
real speech yet. I am going to close to 
hand the floor to him, my colleague 
from Maryland, but let me summarize 
a couple points before I do so. 
I believe the Senate is far better off 
when the minority has the power to 
slow things down. I think that is value, 
to be able to have leverage to get 
amendments; to be able to negotiate a 
compromise; to be able to make sure a 
technical bill has been examined by ex-
perts and you understand what it real-
ly does; to make sure we have seen all 
the provisions; to make sure the public 
has seen all the provisions; to make 
sure the press has been able to inves-
tigate the provisions. All of that is in-
credibly positive, and it is why, wheth-
er I have been in the minority or been 
in the majority, I have argued we need 
to sustain 60 votes to close debate, and 
I still hold that position now—60 votes 
to close debate by a vote. 
There have traditionally been four 
ways that a debate on the floor comes 
to a conclusion. 
The first is a break in the debate. At 
that point, I was struck when I asked 
the experts ‘‘Is the Chair allowed to 
call the question?’’ and I was told that 
not only can they call the question, 
they have a responsibility to call the 
question when there is a break in the 
debate. So a break in the debate is one. 
The second is by unanimous consent. 
Everyone agrees we have been at this 
long 
enough. 
Let’s 
do 
four 
more 
amendments and then go to final pas-
sage, and there is a unanimous consent 
agreement to do that. We still do that 
quite often. 
The third is to have a vote on closing 
debate, and we have to get 60 votes. It 
is not a ratio of those who show up to 
vote. So the irony is, those who want a 
debate often don’t show up. You can 
have a vote 59 to 5, and the 59 lose. You 
have to get 60 votes. 
The fourth is rule XIX, which says 
every Senator gets to speak twice. 
Now, as far as I am aware, there has 
never been a debate in the U.S. Senate 
that was finally brought to a close by 
everyone using up their two speeches, 
but it always hovers there, saying 
there is an eventual ability to vote on 
the question. 
These are the four traditional strate-
gies. We need to apply those four strat-
egies to a period of debate addressing 
final passage of the bill. The cloture 
motion would still be there. The possi-
bility of a UC would still be there. A 
break in the debate would still be a 
break in the debate, and a UC would be 
a UC. All four tools would still be 
there, but we would be addressing final 
passage. 
The problem we have—a little kind of 
behind-the-scenes complexity of Senate 
rules—is that in the modern Senate, 
there is always a pending amendment. 
So you can’t actually get to final pas-
sage unless you have a period of debate 
dedicated to final passage, and break-
ing the debate would call the question 
on the amendment, not final passage. 
This means that those who want 
more debate could hold the floor for 
weeks and weeks on something they 
are determined to keep presenting to 
the American public, but it brings in 
the public. It brings in the public. They 
can weigh in on whether we are heroes 
or whether we are bums. They can 
weigh in on amendments we say we are 
going to bring up the next day. They 
can help us understand how folks back 
home feel. 
There is no public in the no-show, no- 
effort, invisible filibuster we have had 
since 1975. There is no public, and there 
are no amendments because amend-
ments require a supermajority to close 
debate. Someone says: Well, I am not 
going to agree to that until my amend-
ment gets up. There is no longer a so-
cial contract: You do your amendment. 
I will do my amendment. We will all do 
them. They will be on topic. 
It is gone. So the number of amend-
ments has dropped tenfold between the 
109th Congress and the 116th Congress. 
The number of amendments dropped 
more than tenfold over that time pe-
riod. Instead, the floor managers nego-
tiate. The leaders negotiate. They 
produce a list and then ask everyone to 
agree to that list, and someone objects: 
You left out my amendment. 
So we—a room full of former House 
Members and industry leaders, former 
Governors, former speakers of their 
State house or presidents of their State 
senate; all of this talent sitting around 
here—do nothing day after day after 
day while the invisible, no-show, no-ef-
fort filibuster destroys debate in the 
Senate of the United States of Amer-
ica. 
It is our responsibility to restore de-
bate 
in 
this 
Chamber, 
to 
restore 
amendments. The advantages of the 
restoration are, No. 1, that you have 
amendments; No. 2, that you have pub-
lic debate; and No. 3, perhaps the most 
important, you have an incentive for 
both sides to negotiate, because under 
the no-show, no-effort, invisible fili-
buster that we have had since 1975, the 
minority of either side says: You know, 
if I can get 41 of our minority Members 
to agree not to close debate, and all 
they have to do is not even show up to 
vote or show up to vote if they like but 
vote no, then the majority can never 
get anything done, and won’t that en-
hance our political power in the minor-
ity party? 
That is an almost irresistible temp-
tation in the tribal, partisan warfare of 
today. So each minority is tempted 
into basically exercising a veto over 
the majority party’s policy agenda. 
That is ‘‘an eye for an eye makes the 
whole world blind,’’ strategy. The 
Democrats sabotage the Republican 
majority. The Republicans sabotage 
the Democratic majority. But under 
the public filibuster, not only is the 
public involved, but the minority has 
to maintain continuous debate, which 
can be hard, so they have an incentive 
to negotiate. The majority, seeing the 
time burned up that they need for 
other things, other policy bills and 
nominations, they have an incentive to 
negotiate. So you get amendments. 
You get the public involved. Most im-
portant, you recreate an incentive to 
negotiate. That is the reinvigorated fil-
ibuster strategy, the talking filibuster. 
Call it the public filibuster or just 
call it extended debate on final passage 
of the bill. Whatever you call it, it is 
better than the paralysis and partisan-
ship that are destroying the Senate’s 
ability to address the questions that 
face this Nation, and there is no more 
important question than defending the 
right of every citizen to vote.

ator from Maryland.

H.R. 5746 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, let 
me start by thanking our colleague, 
the Senator from Oregon, Senator 
MERKLEY, for his leadership in working 
to restore the functioning of the Sen-
ate and to protect our democracy. We 
need both, and we need them now. 
It was just 12 days ago that we 
marked the 1-year anniversary of the 
January 6 attack on this Capitol and 
on our democracy itself. It was a vio-
lent attempt to stop Congress from cer-
tifying the Presidential election of Joe 
Biden and to overturn the decision of 
the American people. It was inspired 
and instigated by the former President. 
While that assault did not succeed in 
stopping us from counting the vote 
that day, the Big Lie did not die. In 
fact, the Big Lie has metastasized. It 
has spread, and its poison is seeping 
across the country. It is now taking

the 
form 
of 
Republican-controlled 
State legislatures enacting laws that 
erect new barriers to the ballot box. 
Let’s be clear. They are erecting bar-
riers specifically designed to make it 
harder for people of color and younger 
voters to cast their ballots. 
As we saw in a Federal Circuit Court 
case a number of years ago with re-
spect to North Carolina, the court 
found that the State legislature had 
targeted African-American voters with 
surgical precision. 
Dr. King observed that voting is ‘‘the 
foundation stone for political action.’’ 
He also observed that when the right to 
vote is impeded, a tragic betrayal of 
the highest mandates of our demo-
cratic tradition are betrayed. 
What we see happening in State leg-
islatures are not just efforts to put up 
barriers to the ballot box; they are also 
passing laws to authorize partisan 
operatives to interfere in the counting 
of the votes and even to overturn the 
results after the count. So laws to 
interfere with the casting of the votes 
and laws to interfere with the counting 
of the votes—that is what is happening 
right 
now. 
Nineteen 
legislatures 
around the country have already en-
acted these kinds of laws. 
So, yes, our democracy was under at-
tack right here on January 6 of last 
year, but 1 year later, the evidence is 
clear: The Big Lie is alive, and our de-
mocracy is still under attack. It is 
under attack by those seeking to im-
plement the Big Lie in State legisla-
tures. It is just the venue that has 
changed. 
When we reconvened here after the 
attacks of January 6, I said on this 
floor that what we witnessed is what 
happens when we don’t stand up to-
gether as Democrats and Republicans 
to confront the Big Lie. 
Now, over a year later, we have an-
other chance to stand up together. To 
meet this moment and to protect our 
democracy, we need to take action here 
and now. That is what the Freedom to 
Vote Act does. It establishes minimum 
standards to ensure equal access to the 
ballot box across the country. It guards 
against partisan election meddling. It 
ends gerrymandering nationwide, and 
it ends secret money in elections. It 
contains the John R. Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act to restore the 
protections guaranteed in the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. That is what it does. 
We are well within our rights as Fed-
eral lawmakers to write and pass these 
bills. The relevant portion of article I, 
section 4, clause 1 of the Constitution— 
I have that here—clearly states: 
The Times, Places and Manner of holding 
Elections for Senators and Representatives, 
shall be prescribed in each State by the Leg-
islature thereof; but the Congress may at 
any time by Law make or alter such Regula-
tions. 
The Constitution specifically empow-
ers us to pass these laws to protect vot-
ing. So enough of the specious argu-
ment I have heard so many times here 
on the Senate floor that these bills 
somehow represent an unconstitutional 
power grab—far from it. The Framers 
expressly empowered the Congress to 
protect Federal elections. 
Now, all 50 Members of the Demo-
cratic majority, the Democratic cau-
cus, support these bills to protect our 
democracy. I am disappointed that, as 
of this moment, not one Member of the 
Senate Republican caucus plans to join 
us. In fact, we know that there are 16 
Republican Senators here today who 
voted in 2006 to reauthorize the Voting 
Rights Act. Today, not a single Repub-
lican Senator will stand up and support 
these bills. That is a very sad and bad 
sign of this moment in our history. 
I accept that each and every Senator 
has the right to cast their vote on bills 
however they choose. That is the way 
democracy works. But what is hap-
pening now is very different. Repub-
lican Senators are using the current 
version of the Senate rules to block a 
vote on these vital measures to protect 
our democracy; to prevent this body 
from having a final vote on the Free-
dom to Vote legislation and the John 
R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement 
Act. 
So let’s step back and look at how 
the current version of the Senate rules 
operates in practice, and I say ‘‘current 
rules’’ because the Senate rules have 
evolved over time, as our colleague 
from Oregon has mentioned. They have 
taken many twists and turns over the 
years. In their current form and prac-
tice, they have departed radically from 
their original purpose and design. 
Today, with some exceptions, 41 out 
of 100 Senators can block the other 59 
from voting on legislation that is im-
portant to the American people. Over 
the last year, this Senate rule has been 
used to block bills that enact common-
sense gun safety provisions and provide 
for equal pay for equal work. Many 
other bills have been blocked from 
even getting a vote under the current 
Senate rules. 
So let’s unpack this. Let’s under-
stand what this means. 
Right now, under our rules, it is pos-
sible for 41 Senators representing 21 
States and 11 percent of the U.S. popu-
lation to block the will of 50 Senators 
representing 84 percent of the U.S. pop-
ulation. Think about that. Under our 
current rules, Senators representing a 
small percentage of the population—11 
percent—can block the will of the ma-
jority. 
How did this happen? Well, it hap-
pened because over time—not at the 
beginning but over time—Senators de-
cided to empower themselves at the ex-
pense of the American people. It wasn’t 
always this way. As I said, in its ear-
liest days, the Senate was founded on 
two principles. The first was that Sen-
ators would have ample opportunity to 
make their case to their fellow Sen-
ators and to the country. If they had 
the minority position on a particular 
issue, they had a chance to come here 
to the floor of the Senate to persuade 
their colleagues of the merits of their 
position and maybe in the process have 
the whole country turn to their side of 
the debate and influence the ultimate 
result. 
So the Senators were given the op-
portunity for a prolonged debate to en-
sure that all opinions were heard and 
considered before the final vote. In 
fact, as my colleague from Oregon 
mentioned, each Senator was able to 
deliver two speeches on a particular 
question on a single legislative day. 
But after all the views were heard, 
after prolonged debate was ended, the 
Senate would move to a majority vote. 
That is how the Senate earned its rep-
resentation as the world’s greatest de-
liberative body. 
Nothing could be further from that 
truth today. We have very little debate 
on the Senate floor today—real debate, 
where Senators engage on the big ques-
tions of the day. In fact, the minority 
of Senators who oppose legislation 
pending before the Senate can block it 
without even coming to the Senate 
floor to debate. They don’t even have 
to come here to make their case to 
their fellow Senators and the American 
people, don’t even have to show up to 
debate. We are talking about a Senate 
rule that was designed to encourage de-
bate. Yet we have it operating today 
where nobody has to even show up on 
this floor to make their position 
known. 
It is not that Senators don’t even 
have to show up to debate; they don’t 
even have to show up for the vote to 
cut off debate. Under our current rules, 
we could have a vote right here in the 
Senate of 59 to nothing in favor of mov-
ing forward on legislation, and the 41 
Senators who didn’t even show up 
would carry the day. They would block 
the 59 from expressing the will of the 
American people. How crazy is that? 
That is what the current Senate rules 
provide. 
That is not what the Founders of our 
Republic envisioned. In fact, the cur-
rent version and application of the 
Senate’s rules amount to a total per-
version of the constitutional frame-
work. These rules pervert the intent of 
our Framers, and they undermine the 
democratic architecture of our Repub-
lic. 
Our Founders never—never—intended 
for a minority of Senators—for 41 Sen-
ators—to be able to thwart the will of 
the majority and of the people. 
In Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton 
asserted that the fundamental maxim 
of republican government was ‘‘the 
sense of the majority should prevail.’’ 
Even more clearly right on point was 
James Madison in Federalist 58, where 
he directly warned against requiring 
more than a majority for a decision in 
the legislature, saying that ‘‘the funda-
mental principle of free government 
would be reversed. It would be no 
longer the majority that would rule: 
the power would be transferred to the 
minority.’’ This is James Madison, a 
key architect of our Constitution and 
the framework of this Republic.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S241 
January 18, 2022 
Now, we know it is true that the 
Framers of our Constitution knew the 
dangers of overly powerful majorities, 
and they wanted to and did guard 
against that risk in the Constitution 
itself. That is why the Framers dif-
fused power among the people, among 
the States, and within the Federal 
Government—to 
protect 
minority 
viewpoints in the country. 
In the Bill of Rights, our Founders 
clearly said that each American has 
certain unalienable rights that no gov-
ernment action can take away—not by 
a vote of this Congress, not by an order 
of the President, not by anybody in the 
executive branch. That is the Bill of 
Rights. Our Founders also created 
three coequal branches of government 
constrained by a system of checks and 
balances. It is all right here in the Con-
stitution. 
Within 
the 
legislative 
branch, they didn’t create one unitary 
body, like most Parliaments today; 
they created two separate bodies—the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives—and a totally independent execu-
tive branch, with the President di-
rectly elected by the people through 
the electoral college. 
Now, I think it is worth pointing out 
that the Senate contains built-in pro-
tections for the minority by its very 
structure. The 2 Senators from Wyo-
ming represent 578,000 of our fellow 
Americans, and the 2 Senators from 
California represent 39 million of our 
fellow Americans. Two Senators from 
Wyoming represent 578,000 people, and 
2 Senators from California represent 39 
million Americans, but here in the 
Senate, each of those Senators, wheth-
er from Wyoming or California, has 
votes of equal weight. We can do the 
math, the political math. 
People of Wyoming are already exert-
ing influence here in the Senate way 
out of proportion to their share of the 
American population. That is in the 
structure. But if you layer the current 
version of the Senate filibuster rule on 
top of the Senate structure and on top 
of other protections for minority rights 
enshrined in our Constitution, you fur-
ther nullify the will of the American 
people. You nullify the will of the ma-
jority of our fellow citizens. 
That is why the anti—majoritarian, 
anti-democratic—small 
‘‘d’’—Senate 
rule is nowhere to be found in the Con-
stitution. You can search high and low; 
it is nowhere to be found here. In fact, 
as I said, our Founders were very clear 
about allowing the majority sentiment 
vote to prevail in the end. And they 
were very clear in this document, the 
Constitution, exactly when to require a 
supermajority vote. It is right here: 
Two-thirds vote of all Members is re-
quired to convict and remove a Presi-
dent; two-thirds vote is needed to expel 
a Senator; two-thirds needed to over-
ride a Presidential veto; two-thirds 
vote to concur on treaties; two-thirds 
to amend the Constitution. That is it. 
That is what is in the Constitution of 
the United States. 
Our Founders did not envision a Sen-
ate where the normal course of legisla-
tive process and business could be per-
manently blocked by a minority of 
Senators. There is nothing in here 
about needing 60 out of 100 votes to 
pass legislation like the Freedom to 
Vote Act. There is nothing in our Con-
stitution about a Senate where 41 out 
of 100 Senators can routinely block the 
will of the majority and subvert the 
will of the American people. 
James 
Madison 
expressly 
warned 
against requiring supermajorities for 
legislation—yes for treaties, yes for re-
moval of a President, not for the nor-
mal course of legislation. 
So where did the current Senate rule 
come from? It is a total invention of 
Senators 
that 
empowers 
individual 
Senators by disempowering the over-
whelming majority of the American 
people. That is what it is. 
Think about this in the context of 
the Freedom to Vote Act. The duly 
elected President of the United States, 
who won over 80 million votes and in 
the electoral college, is in favor of it. A 
majority of the House of Representa-
tives representing the majority of the 
American people is in favor of it. And 
50 U.S. Senators representing 62 per-
cent of the American people are in 
favor of it. But the bill is being blocked 
by a minority of Senators representing 
a minority of the American people. 
And think about this. State legisla-
tures around the country, as we gather 
here, are passing laws to erect barriers 
to voting by a majority vote. The laws 
they are passing impact every citizen 
in this country because they impact 
the outcome of Federal elections. When 
State legislatures in Georgia pass laws 
to disenfranchise voters in Federal 
elections, they are disenfranchising 
voters in all of the other 49 States who 
have a stake in the outcome of Federal 
elections. 
But the current version of the Senate 
rules prevents the U.S. Senate from 
casting a majority vote to protect vot-
ing for every American, even though 
the Constitution expressly empowers 
us to do that—to regulate Federal elec-
tions. 
So, Mr. President, what arguments 
do proponents of the current filibuster 
rule present to justify this self-anoint-
ed power to thwart the majority will of 
the American people? 
One claim is that it promotes biparti-
sanship. Look, I know the Presiding Of-
ficer. I know the Senator from Virginia 
who has joined us. I know the Senator 
from Oregon. All of us prefer to find 
common ground to meet the challenges 
of the day when we can. I am proud to 
be the author of many bipartisan meas-
ures and to sponsor many others, and 
to vote for many of those measures. 
But let’s not kid ourselves here in the 
U.S. Senate about the ability of the 60- 
vote requirement to promote biparti-
sanship. The Senate we are living in 
today is the most polarized ever. The 
claim that this rule promotes biparti-
sanship flies in the face of the reality 
we witness every day. 
In fact, the filibuster in its current 
form has become a partisan political 
weapon. Tim Lau of the Brennan Cen-
ter notes that, while there have been 
more than 2,000 filibusters since 1917, 
about half of them have been in just 
the past 12 years. Think about that. 
There were more filibusters in Presi-
dent Obama’s second term than in all 
the years between World War I and the 
end of the Reagan administration com-
bined. This abuse has led to partisan 
gridlock, not bipartisan cooperation. 
But let’s talk about bipartisanship. I 
had hoped—we had hoped—that action 
to preserve our democracy would be a 
bipartisan endeavor. But that isn’t 
where we are today, and that is not 
new. The battle to protect constitu-
tional rights has been waged along 
party lines in the past. The Fourteenth 
Amendment, which guaranteed citizen-
ship to former slaves and guarantees 
equal protection under the law, was 
passed by Republicans in Congress with 
almost no bipartisan support. We sa-
lute them for that action. The 15th 
Amendment guarantees the right to 
vote to all citizens of the United 
States, and it was passed by one party 
and one party alone. Those actions 
were taken by the old Republican 
Party that used to be the party of Lin-
coln. Should we have sacrificed those 
critical amendments at the altar of bi-
partisanship? Should we have said to 
them: Don’t pass them because no 
Democrats at that time supported 
them? Of course not. 
We all strive for bipartisanship, but 
that goal should not stand in the way 
of legislative action, especially on 
issues central to protecting our democ-
racy. 
Another argument often made, in-
cluding by many of our Democratic 
colleagues, in favor of keeping the cur-
rent version of the Senate rules and 
the supermajority requirement, high-
lights the risk of giving up the ‘‘protec-
tion’’ of the filibuster on issues that 
Democrats hold dear and where Repub-
licans hold a different position. 
If we eliminate the 60-vote threshold 
to pass policies that Republicans don’t 
like, won’t Republicans be able to use a 
majority vote to pass policies that 
Democrats don’t like? 
That is true. That is the nature of de-
mocracy. That is what elections are 
for—every 2 years for Members of the 
House, every 6 years for the Senate, 
and every 4 years for the President. If 
the American people don’t like a law 
that we have passed, they get to go to 
the ballot box to render a decision. 
That is the ultimate accountability in 
the system, and we should not be erect-
ing artificial rules to protect ourselves 
from the majority views of the Amer-
ican people. 
In fact, it is simply arrogant—arro-
gant—to invent a rule that blocks the 
will of the American people. It is sim-
ply arrogant to say that we Senators, 
not we the people, are the guardians of 
our democracy, and we are going to 
come up with this rule that is not in 
the Constitution to do that. That is 
what our current Senate rules do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S242 
January 18, 2022 
Now, there is one major exception to 
the 60-vote rule to end a filibuster on 
legislation. It is called the reconcili-
ation process. I believe that this major 
exception exposes the absurdity of the 
current Senate rule itself. Most folks 
watching this debate may be justifi-
ably confused. They are watching the 
Senate and they are saying: It was 
about a year ago that the Senate 
passed the American Rescue Plan with 
a majority vote. It was a vote of 50 to 
49. It was a major piece of legislation 
responding to the pandemic emer-
gency. Not a single Republican Senator 
voted for it, but it passed. During the 
Trump administration, Senate Repub-
licans passed a major tax giveaway to 
the rich by a vote of 51 to 48. Not a sin-
gle Democrat voted for it. 
Those laws contained major policy 
changes, but they could not be blocked 
by a vote of a minority of 41 Senators. 
Why is that? It is because in 1974, the 
Senate carved out a major exception to 
the supermajority filibuster rule for 
legislation connected to the annual 
budget process. That carve-out—that 
procedure—allowed for the passage of 
the Trump tax law, for the American 
Rescue Plan, and earlier for the Afford-
able Care Act. 
So, colleagues, here we are maintain-
ing this carve-out to the filibuster rule 
that allows Donald Trump and Senate 
Republicans to pass big tax cuts by a 
majority party-line vote. You can’t 
block it with a vote of 41. It allows us 
to pass important things like the 
American Rescue Plan, using the same 
procedure. 
But our rules don’t allow us to pass 
rules to protect our democracy. That is 
absurd. Anyone paying close attention 
to the rules would see how absurd that 
is in a great democracy, and it needs to 
change and it needs to change now. 
Each day that we maintain the cur-
rent undemocratic Senate rules that 
allow 41 Senators to block the will of 
the majority, we allow State legisla-
tures to continue their assault on de-
mocracy and we prevent our own de-
mocracy from working the way it was 
intended. 
The American people sent us here to 
get things done, to move the country 
forward, and the overwhelming major-
ity are crying out for us to protect the 
future of our democracy. That is why 
we must amend the undemocratic rule 
that empowers 41 of 100 Senators to 
disempower the majority of the people 
of our country. 
And I support the proposal put for-
ward by our colleague from Oregon, 
Senator MERKLEY, that takes us back 
to the original design and intent of the 
first Senate and the Framers—debate. 
Everyone gets a chance to make their 
point. Convince your colleagues and 
convince the American people. But as 
James Madison said, at the end of the 
day, a great democracy must have a 
majority rule subject to the conditions 
already applied and set out in our Con-
stitution. 
So I urge my colleagues to join us in 
restoring the Senate to its original 
purpose and then to pass the Freedom 
to Vote Act, including the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, 
to protect our democracy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, last 
week, I gave a long, detailed speech on 
the topic that was at hand last week 
and is the topic, right now, that we are 
focusing on here in the U.S. Senate: 
voting rights and the majority leader’s 
goal this week, as it was last week, to 
blow up the legislative filibuster. 
I believe it would be the first time in 
U.S. history that a majority leader 
would actually seek to do this—to blow 
up the legislative filibuster—which, in 
and of itself, says a lot. This would, of 
course, change the Senate and change 
the country forever. There will be a lot 
of speeches on that. There will be many 
more speeches today, tomorrow, and 
Thursday on these important topics. 
Now, the President of the United 
States weighed in on these two topics— 
the filibuster and voting rights—in 
Georgia, in a speech last week that is 
already going down as an infamous 
speech by a President of the United 
States. Let’s just say it really didn’t go 
very well, the President’s speech. 
I ask all Americans to take a look at 
it. It is quite disturbing for a whole 
host of reasons. The President’s speech 
was almost universally panned, on the 
left even, on the right, and in the cen-
ter. I have not seen one U.S. Senator 
come down on the floor, this week, to 
defend it. It will be interesting, as we 
debate these issues, if anyone does, but 
I doubt there will be, and there are 
many reasons for this. 
As a speech by a President, it was re-
markably divisive—in essence, calling 
every Senator, Democrat or Repub-
lican, who doesn’t agree with him a 
racist and a traitor. Read the speech. It 
was historically absurd—invoking the 
sacrifices of the Civil War and heroes 
like Abraham Lincoln and villains like 
Jefferson Davis to present-day cir-
cumstances. It was profoundly un-Pres-
idential, as Senator MCCONNELL stated, 
rhetoric, completely unbecoming of a 
President of the United States, and in 
an attempt to get Senators, especially 
Democrat Senators, to vote the way in 
which President Biden wants them to 
vote, it appears to have been a monu-
mental failure. Now, I wonder why. 
Well, of course, here is why. 
Calling someone a racist and a trai-
tor is not the normal, logical route to 
try to persuade one to come over to 
your side—neither is claiming that Re-
publican Senators, Republican legisla-
tors, States, and Republican State vot-
ing laws are so-called Jim Crow 2.0, 
when your very own State’s laws, in 
terms of voting, are some of the most 
restrictive in the country. This is a 
narrative, I hope, our friends in the 
media will keep an eye on during the 
debates this week. 
What am I talking about? 
Well, first and foremost, I am talking 
about Majority Leader SCHUMER and 
Joe Biden and their States, New York 
and Delaware, which have some of the 
most restrictive voting laws in Amer-
ica. Let me repeat that. Some of the 
most restrictive voting laws in Amer-
ica come from the majority leader’s 
State and the President of the United 
States’ State. Yet listen to their rhet-
oric. Listen to their rhetoric: Repub-
licans and Republican States are ‘‘Jim 
Crow 2.0.’’ 
I was on the floor last week, talking 
in particular detail about my State’s 
laws. We are all different States here, 
but I know my State’s laws. I know 
them well as they relate to voting 
rights. Here is one thing I said last 
week: On some of the most critical 
issues, in terms of voting rights legis-
lation—early in-person voting, auto-
matic voter registration, and this 
chart here of no-excuse absentee vot-
ing—the Republican State of Alaska, 
the great State of Alaska, has voting 
laws that are significantly more expan-
sive than the laws of New York, than 
the laws of Delaware, than the laws of 
Connecticut, than the laws of Massa-
chusetts, than the laws of New Hamp-
shire. It is a long list, a long list. You 
can see why Senators like me—my con-
stituents, in particular—find it more 
than just a little bit annoying when 
you have these smug arguments of Re-
publican States being Jim Crow 2.0. 
Let me give you another particular 
one as it relates to New York, the ma-
jority leader’s home State. 
My State has no-excuse absentee vot-
ing. We have had that for many, many 
years—many years. Now, the State of 
New York just had a statewide ref-
erendum to have same-day voter reg-
istration and no-excuse absentee vot-
ing to meet the high standards that we 
have in Alaska. The people of New 
York recently rejected that. I don’t 
know why. I am not from New York. I 
am sure they had what they thought 
were good reasons to do that, but if the 
majority leader keeps coming down 
and calling the Republican States that 
restrict voting Jim Crow 2.0, is he 
going to go to Times Square and call 
his own constituents Jim Crow 2.0, rel-
ative to my great State—because they 
just rejected doing this, restricting 
voting rights—according to the logic of 
the majority leader and the President 
of the United States? 
There is something really wrong here 
on these arguments and it is not just 
New York and it is not just my making 
these arguments about where other 
States are. Again, my argument here is

not to say: Well, everybody should be 
like Alaska. In the Constitution, the 
Founders gave the States the funda-
mental right and obligation and re-
sponsibility to design their States’ 
laws in terms of voting. What is really 
difficult to swallow is that so many of 
the arguments we are going to hear 
this week and that we heard last week 
and that we heard from the President 
of the United States come from elected 
officials—U.S. Senators and the Presi-
dent, who is a former Senator—who 
come from States that have some of 
the most least restrictive voting laws 
in the country. 
Again, it is not just me making this 
argument. This is an article I sub-
mitted for the RECORD, last week, from 
The Atlantic magazine—not a Repub-
lican mouthpiece by any measure. I am 
going to read extensively from this ar-
ticle, which came out last year, be-
cause it really makes the point I am 
trying to make. 
Biden has assailed Georgia’s new voting 
law as an atrocity akin to ‘‘Jim Crow in the 
21st century’’ for the impact it could have on 
Black citizens. But even once the GOP- 
passed measure takes effect, Georgia citizens 
will have far more opportunities to vote be-
fore Election Day than their counterparts in 
the president’s home state, where one in 
three residents is Black or Latino. To Repub-
licans, Biden’s criticism of the Georgia law 
smacks of hypocrisy. ‘‘They have a point,’’ 
says Dwayne Bensing, a voting-rights advo-
cate with Delaware’s ACLU affiliate. ‘‘The 
state is playing catch-up— 
The State of Delaware— 
in a lot of ways.’’ 
The article goes on: 
Delaware isn’t an anomaly among Demo-
cratic strongholds, and its example presents 
the president’s party with an uncomfortable 
reminder: Although Democrats like to call 
out Republicans for trying to suppress vot-
ing, the states they control in the Northeast 
make casting a ballot more difficult than 
anywhere else. 
I am going to read that again. I am 
going to read that again because it is 
an issue that no one is talking about, 
and it really smacks of hypocrisy when 
I see some of my colleagues down here 
making these great arguments about 
Jim Crow 2.0 in Republican States. 
Here it is again, from The Atlantic: 
Delaware isn’t an anomaly among Demo-
crat strongholds— 
Democratic State strongholds— 
and its example presents the president’s 
party with an uncomfortable reminder. Al-
though Democrats like to call out Repub-
licans for trying to suppress voting, the 
states they control in the Northeast make 
casting a ballot more difficult than any-
where else. 
Then the article goes on to say: 
Connecticut has no early voting at all— 
Holy cow, my State has early voting. 
We have had it for years— 
and New York’s onerous rules force voters to 
change their registration months in advance 
if they want to participate in a party pri-
mary. 
And, by the way, New York just re-
jected what Alaska has. Jim Crow 2.0 
in New York? Who knows? Maybe, ac-
cording to the President’s logic. 
The article goes on: 
In Rhode Island, Democrats enacted a dec-
ade ago the kind of photo-ID law that the 
[Democratic] party has labeled ‘‘racist’’ 
when drafted by Republicans. 
Hmm, a little bit of hypocrisy there. 
The article goes on: 
[T]he State [Rhode Island] also requires 
voters to get the signatures of not one but 
two witnesses when casting an absentee bal-
lot (only Alabama and North Carolina are 
similarly strict). 
The article goes on: 
According to a new analysis released this 
week by the nonpartisan Center for Election 
Innovation and Research, Delaware, Con-
necticut, and New York rank in the bottom 
third of states in their access to early and 
mail-in balloting. 
And, as I just said, New York just re-
jected it again. I really wonder if the 
majority leader is going to come down 
and call his citizens Jim Crow 2.0. 
This is a very important issue, and 
here is the bottom line: Before any of 
my Democratic colleagues come to the 
floor this week with their insults, with 
their smug, offensive, inaccurate argu-
ments about Jim Crow 2.0 racist trad-
ers, mimicking the President of the 
United States last week in Georgia, I 
want my colleagues to come and an-
swer this simple question—a very sim-
ple question: Why should we listen to 
you? Why should any American take 
you seriously, when so many of you 
come from States with the most re-
strictive voting laws in America? 
I wonder if any of my colleagues are 
going to come down to the floor, par-
ticularly those like the majority lead-
er, who love to rant about Jim Crow 2.0 
when their States are leading the 
charge in America on restrictive vot-
ing. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this past 
weekend—and 
yesterday, 
in 
par-
ticular—we celebrated Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. It is likely, if you at-
tended any event in that celebration, 
that you heard at least part of his ‘‘I 
Have a Dream’’ speech. Many of us in 
the Chamber happily quoted it because 
of our respect for him and the elo-
quence of his language in that moment. 
We like to remember the hopeful sec-
ond half of that speech, as well, be-
cause Dr. King imagined a future in 
which Black children and White chil-
dren play together, and all people are 
judged, as he so famously said, ‘‘not by 
the color of our skin but by the con-
tent of our character.’’ 
However, 
many 
of 
us 
forget—or 
worse, ignore—the first half of that 
speech, in which Dr. King noted the 
painful irony that 100 years after the 
Emancipation 
Proclamation—the 
‘‘promissory note’’ of our Constitution 
and the Declaration of Independence 
was for most Black Americans simply 
‘‘a bad check which has come back 
marked ‘insufficient funds.’ ’’ 
Many Democratic Senators and Re-
publican Senators helped to change 
that shameful fact. It was here on the 
floor of this Chamber, in 1965, that the 
U.S. Senate voted 77 to 19 to pass the 
Voting Rights Act, outlawing State 
practices that denied millions of Amer-
icans, particularly Black Americans, 
the right to vote. It is worth noting 
that it was a strong bipartisan vote 
and that, percentagewise, a greater 
percentage of the Republican Caucus 
voted in support of it, compared to 
Democrats. The White Democrats from 
the South were notorious at that time 
for opposing it and opposing the civil 
rights movement. 
Well, over the next nearly 50 years, 
the Voting Rights Act was reauthor-
ized five times, and that bipartisanship 
continued during the entire period. 
Each new version of the Voting Rights 
Act renewed the promise and the pro-
tections of that law, and each reau-
thorization was signed into law by a 
Republican President. 
Sadly, in more recent years, things 
have changed in an awful way. We have 
witnessed a sustained effort to chip 
away the protections guaranteed to 
every 
American 
under 
the 
Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
I grew up in East St. Louis, IL, and a 
trip to St. Louis was a big deal. I can 
remember my mother, who was an im-
migrant to this country, had only an 
eighth grade education, though she had 
self-taught herself into a much higher 
level of learning, but I can remember 
my mother always pointing out the St. 
Louis courthouse to me. If you are fa-
miliar with the terrain, the arch 
wasn’t there when I was growing up. 
But where that arch is today, just be-
hind it, is this famous St. Louis court-
house. We would be driving over the 
Eads Bridge, and she would say to me: 
Now, do you see that St. Louis court-
house up there? That big white build-
ing, do you see it? And do you see all 
those steps that you can see from here? 
Yes. 
They used to sell slaves on those 
steps. 
I found it incredible that my mom 
would say that. She was not a historian 
or, as I had mentioned, formally edu-
cated, but she knew that, and she knew 
that was the significance of that build-
ing. It was also the courthouse where 
the Dred Scott decision was argued. 
I say that because the Dred Scott de-
cision, that infamous decision handed 
down in 1857, may have been the tip-
ping point when it came to our Civil 
War. A decision by that court, now 
viewed as nothing short of outrageous, 
basically ruled that enslaved people, 
regardless of where they lived in the 
United States, could never be treated 
as American citizens and had no right 
to sue in the Federal courts of Amer-
ica. 
Despite State decisions to have free 
States and enslaved States, despite the 
Missouri Compromise, the Supreme 
Court in the Dred Scott decision basi-
cally came down clearly on the side of

enslavement and said, for example, 
that the Missouri court doctrine of 
‘‘once free, always free’’ did not help 
Harriet and Dred Scott, who lived in 
free States part of their lives. 
That decision by the Supreme Court 
was a seminal decision in the history of 
our country. It is often noted the role 
that it played and the events that tran-
spired afterward. 
I think of that decision when I think 
of what has happened in recent years in 
the Supreme Court. Nine years ago, in 
2013, the Supreme Court issued its deci-
sion in Shelby County v. Holder. That 
Supreme Court decision essentially 
nullified a key provision of the Voting 
Rights Act: section 5. Prior to the 
Court’s ruling in Shelby County, sec-
tion 
5 
required 
localities 
disenfranchising people based on race 
through poll taxes or literacy tests to 
seek Federal approval to any changes 
in their voting rules. That requirement 
is known as preclearance, and it could 
have—I believe it would have—pre-
vented many of the restrictive voting 
laws in Georgia and Texas. 
The Supreme Court weakened an-
other key section of the Voting Rights 
Act with its decision in Brnovich v. 
DNC. With these distorted rulings—dis-
torted rulings—in fact, Supreme Court 
Justice Elena Kagan wrote, ‘‘In the 
last decade, this Court has treated no 
statute worse than the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965.’’ 
The Presiding Officer knows what 
has happened across the United States 
in 19 different States. I think, because 
of decisions like Shelby and Brnovich, 
these States have been emboldened. 
They don’t believe that they are going 
to be held accountable for decisions 
they are making that restrict the right 
to vote the way they would have been 
before those decisions. And those who 
come to the defense of those States and 
their practices come to the floor of the 
Senate and, predictably, argue States’ 
rights, States’ rights. 
I heard over the weekend on some of 
the talk shows—I don’t know if there is 
a copy of it here. Oh, there is. I was 
hoping there would be a copy of the 
Constitution in this desk, and there is. 
But article I, section 4 of our Constitu-
tion is explicit, for those who question 
whether or not it is the exclusive prov-
ince of the States to establish stand-
ards for elections. I am going to read 
it. 
Section 4. ‘‘The Times, Places and Manner 
of holding Elections for Senators and Rep-
resentatives, shall be prescribed in each 
State by the Legislature thereof; but the 
Congress may at any time by Law make or 
alter such Regulations, except as to the 
Places of chusing Senators.’’ 
Of course, then the amendments fol-
lowing the Civil War—during and fol-
lowing the Civil War—went even fur-
ther in terms of voting and the issue of 
race. 
It is very clear to me—and you only 
have to read those simple words, 
straightforward and direct in the Con-
stitution, to realize that establishing 
standards for elections is not exclu-
sively within the province of the State. 
In fact, just the opposite is true. When 
it comes to Federal elections for Rep-
resentatives and Senators, authority is 
given to us—to us—this Senate and the 
House 
of Representatives. And, of 
course, through the signature of the 
President, the law is created that can 
establish standards and regulations. 
Yet Members on the other side, Mem-
bers on the side of President Lincoln’s 
political party, the Republican Party, 
now come to us at this moment in his-
tory 
and 
argue 
nullification 
and 
States’ rights. What a cruel twist of 
fate that Mr. Lincoln’s party, which 
took such pride in the progress that 
was made after the deadly Civil War in 
establishing civil rights, is now defend-
ing the activities of 19 different States 
that restrict voting rights. 
Today, our democracy needs the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965 restored to its 
full power and potential. In the past 
year alone, Republican legislatures in 
nearly 20 States have enacted laws 
making it harder for Americans to 
vote. In total, more than 440 bills with 
voting restrictions have been intro-
duced in 49 States, and more are on the 
way as the 2022 State legislative ses-
sions get underway. These efforts rep-
resent the most coordinated assault on 
voting rights since the Voting Rights 
Act was first passed under President 
Lyndon Johnson. 
The most troubling of these bills, the 
ones that I just find incredible, grant 
partisan actors the power to poten-
tially meddle and interfere in election 
administration. Now, where could they 
possibly have come up with that idea; 
that if you lose an election, you would 
contact the election authorities and 
ask them to change the results for 
your favor? Where could they have 
come up with that idea or notion, that 
outrageous idea? Perhaps in the record-
ing that we have of the conversation 
between Georgia election officials and 
President Donald Trump after he lost 
the election in 2020. That is exactly 
what he set out to do. And now, they 
are setting up a scenario for that same 
strategy and tactic to be followed in 
other States if you are disappointed 
with the outcome of an election. 
Arkansas and Kansas have already 
passed laws that—according to experts 
from the States United Democracy 
Center, Protect Democracy, and Law 
Forward—could be used to shift the 
power to influence election outcomes 
to partisan political actors. In those 
States, they have increased the possi-
bility that the voters won’t have the 
last word. 
And legislatures in other States have 
introduced troubling bills with similar 
implications. For instance, in the 
State of Arizona, State legislators in-
troduced three separate bills that, ac-
cording to the Brennan Center for Jus-
tice, ‘‘would have directly empowered 
partisan officials to reject or overturn 
election results.’’ It is an incredible 
outcome. 
More traditional attacks on the right 
to vote include efforts in Michigan, for 
example, where a group of Republican 
lawmakers are attempting to bypass 
the State’s Governor as well as the 
State’s voters to enact a measure re-
stricting voting rights. And, of course, 
in Texas, the State enacted a bill 
known as S.B. 1, which the Brennan 
Center called ‘‘one of the harshest re-
strictive voting bills in the country.’’ 
One of the most troubling provisions of 
the law will make it harder for voters 
living with disabilities to receive the 
accommodations and assistance they 
need to exercise their right to vote. 
The Members of this Senate have a 
constitutional obligation to respond to 
these State voting laws, and that 
means ensuring that the constitutional 
right to vote is protected by Federal 
law and fully enforceable. It also 
means establishing nationwide stand-
ards that ensure every eligible voter 
can participate in our democracy. 
These remedies and protections must 
be available in every State, red and 
blue, from New York to Arizona. 
Allow me to make one other point, 
Mr. President. I have heard my Repub-
lican colleagues make the argument: 
Well, take a look at the States across 
the blue belt of America, States like 
Delaware and New York; they don’t go 
as far as the law that is being sug-
gested by you Democrats—for example, 
same-day registration, for those who 
want to show up and establish their 
voter registration on the day of the 
election. This bill is going to require it. 
The State of New York doesn’t have it. 
The State of Delaware doesn’t have it. 
Well, my message to them is: Good. 
Let them get it. It is a good, positive 
way to expand the opportunity to vote. 
Many States have done it for years 
without problems. Those who are lag-
ging, whether they are red or blue, 
should come into the 21st century. It 
should be our mission—our singular 
mission, before anything else—to make 
sure that every eligible American has 
the right to vote; that we eliminate the 
burdens and obstacles, the tricks and 
traps that have been set up in all these 
States that make it so difficult. And 
we ought to be singularly embarrassed 
as a nation as we look at the film and 
all the videos and all the programs on 
election day that show African Ameri-
cans standing in line, hour after weary 
hour, to exercise the right to vote 
while many White voters just scoot 
through in other localities in the same 
States. There is something fundamen-
tally wrong here, and it is not just an 
accident. 
Last year, I joined with a bipartisan 
group of my colleagues to introduce 
the updated John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement 
Act. 
This 
legislation 
would restore and strengthen the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965, one of the most 
important 
pieces 
of 
legislation 
in 
American history. And truthfully, this 
should, once again, be a bipartisan, 
unifying endeavor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S245 
January 18, 2022 
It hasn’t been that long ago that Re-
publicans and Democrats stood to-
gether and agreed that this was the 
right thing to do—to make sure that 
there was no discrimination against 
American voters. The last time we did 
this was 16 years ago, in 2006, and on a 
nearly unanimous basis. 
One of the Republicans who voted in 
support of it was the senior Senator 
from Kentucky, now the Republican 
leader, who said at that time, when he 
voted for the reauthorization of the 
Voting Rights Act in 2006, ‘‘[T]his is a 
piece of legislation which has worked.’’ 
Well, let’s make sure it can keep 
working. I hope my colleagues will 
come together, in a bipartisan fashion, 
and join us in supporting the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
as well as the Freedom to Vote Act. 
Join us in defending American democ-
racy. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
was out here a little while ago talking 
about why it is so important for us to 
move forward and vote on the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act and to uphold 
the voting rights of American citizens, 
something I feel very strongly about. 
I have had the good fortune to be in 
the U.S. Senate since the year 2000 and 
I got here—I should say the election 
was in 2000; I took the oath of office in 
2001. I got here in an election that was 
decided by 2,229 votes. It took 3 weeks 
to decide the election. It took re-
counts. It took verification by coun-
ties—and, yes, the vote-by-mail system 
which was pretty much the majority of 
votes at that point in time. Not every-
body voted that way, but a big portion 
of votes at that time was a system that 
was starting to flourish in our State. 
And when I think about the year 2000 
and the close election, I give thanks to 
my predecessor Slade Gordon for, even 
though it was a close election, not con-
testing the election. If people remem-
ber, that was the same year that there 
was such a close election that people 
considered what was the outcome in 
Florida. And yet Al Gore conceded the 
election to George Bush. 
My point is that where have we got-
ten to today? Because all of those peo-
ple, George Bush, Al Gore, me, Slade 
Gordon, even though we had close elec-
tions, we had confidence in the out-
come of the election, and we moved 
forward. 
We moved forward so much in fact 
that when our country was attacked 
just a few months later, we all pulled 
together to work together to build a 
more secure nation. We didn’t sit 
around and say—Slade Gordon didn’t 
sit around and say, ‘‘I lost by 2,229 
votes.’’ Al Gore didn’t sit around and 
say he lost Florida by so many votes 
and the votes weren’t counted. 
No, we moved our country forward, 
and here in the U.S. Senate, we even 
discussed voting rights, and we dis-
cussed our Federal role, and we dis-
cussed what reforms we wanted to have 
in the system to build more confidence 
in our electoral system. We didn’t dis-
integrate into voter suppression activi-
ties. I can’t say that there wasn’t 
some. 
I now call it nostalgia. There were 
some who said, ‘‘Oh, yeah, vote-by- 
mail. Maybe we shouldn’t have it.’’ I 
remember one of our colleagues here 
on the Senate floor, he was saying, ‘‘I 
so much like to go into the polling 
place. It is my patriotic duty. I like to 
sign my name. I like to get on with it. 
I don’t want to get rid of that and I 
don’t like vote-by-mail.’’ 
Well, myself and Senator WYDEN, 
Senator MURRAY, and others success-
fully defended vote-by-mail. And we 
can see today where it has now been 
more embraced in the United States of 
America and more than the nostalgia 
that my friend had. 
Trust me, I could say a lot of nos-
talgia about going into a voting place 
and voting. My childhood was spent 
getting the vote out because that is 
what you did in my family. You spent 
the day getting the vote out; you 
helped. I remember 1 year, I said to my 
father, ‘‘I’d miss too much school, and 
I didn’t want to miss anymore school, 
and I had to go to school on election 
day.’’ He told me there was no greater 
education than getting the vote out 
and that I was going to be doing that. 
So I can be nostalgic, too. 
But right now, I am proud of the 84 
percent turnout in the State of Wash-
ington in a Presidential election year, 
thanks to vote-by-mail. And I am 
proud that vote-by-mail, I think, is the 
antidote to the accusations that people 
have about a voting system that they 
think can be attacked by a foreign gov-
ernment or undermined in an elec-
tronic voting system. The fact that 
when you vote-by-mail, you sign your 
name, both on the registration form, 
sign your name on the mail-in ballot, 
rip off a tab, basically mail in that bal-
lot, and you have proof that you voted. 
And your signature is the verification. 
I am going to talk about that in a 
minute. 
Your signature is the verification 
that that system works. So, yes, I am 
not very happy that we are here be-
cause a lot of the tactics that we are 
hearing 
about 
around 
the 
United 
States of America is about limiting 
vote-by-mail. It is about trying to stop 
it or slow it down or raise accusations 
about how it doesn’t work. 
And part of the initial establishment 
of preclearance in the United States in 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act was about 
the great disparity that existed in the 
United States between States, that 
some States had very different turn-
outs than other States in a Presi-
dential election, maybe 20 percent or 30 
percent different. And so people were 
starting to say, ‘‘How are you affecting 
us if some States aren’t really empow-
ering their citizens to vote, and the 
consequences is suppressing voter ac-
tivity?’’ 
I definitely believe in the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act. I definitely believe 
that, starting in 1965, we had disparity 
in States and the way they voted, and 
we did something about it. And we did 
something about it because people were 
being discriminated against, and that 
was the premise of the law, stop the 
discrimination. 
Stop the discriminatory tactics that 
States were using to discriminate 
against people so that their votes 
couldn’t be cast. And now, we have up-
dated that law many times over the 
last several decades in a bipartisan 
fashion, most of the time signed into 
law by Republican Presidents. So I 
don’t get the stumbling block here. I 
don’t get the stumbling block why peo-
ple won’t come to the table and help us 
write the next version of the 1965 Civil 
Rights Act that is just called the 2022 
Civil Rights Act. I don’t get it. I don’t 
get why people aren’t coming to the 
table to do that. But I know this, that 
one of the big lies out there, and the 
Republicans—I see my colleague was 
here from Alaska, and I do feel a great 
affinity. 
People may not understand the rela-
tionship between the State of Alaska 
and the State of Washington, but it is 
a very true affinity. We come from the 
same part of the world. Our economies 
are integrated. We have many people 
who live in both places. We share com-
monality of culture, of our environ-
ment. And my colleague from Alaska 
was here talking about their vote-by- 
mail system. 
And so the fact that people are tell-
ing lies and trying to suppress the vote 
by suppressing vote-by-mail or calling 
it fraudulent is very frustrating. It is 
very frustrating, and it is one of the 
reasons we should come together in a 
bipartisan way and support vote-by- 
mail. We should be empowering people, 
and particularly in a pandemic, to cast 
a vote so that we know their voting is 
counted, so that we can have con-
fidence we had an election and people 
spoke. 
Here, we have Newt Gingrich who 
said numerous times now, ‘‘The biggest 
way to expand voter fraud is to expand 
vote-by-mail.’’ Now, he said that on 
FOX News. It has been quoted in the 
paper—not once, he said it several 
times—or maybe they keep reading the 
same clip over and over again. 
Then his next line, which I didn’t put 
on a chart, is, ‘‘And the Democrats 
want 
universal 
access 
to 
vote-by- 
mail.’’ Well, I am not sure what is 
wrong with vote-by-mail. We are going 
to talk about that because I am not 
sure what is wrong with vote-by-mail.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S246 
January 18, 2022 
Seriously, I have seen it over the 20 
years I have been in office expanded in 
our State and in Oregon and now used 
as the majority of the way that people 
vote. And so I don’t take kindly to his 
comments or to the former President’s 
comments that somehow this is a 
fraudulent system. It is not. 
(Ms. BALDWIN assumed the Chair.) 
Madam President, first of all—I have 
got a lot of charts here, so you will 
have to excuse us. 
First of all, when you get a voter reg-
istration form for vote-by-mail, it says 
right on the form you must be a citizen 
of the United States of America to 
vote. You must be 18 years of old the 
next election, or—yeah, or 18 before the 
special election. That is what it says 
right on the form. There is no mis-
taking about it. There is no ifs, ands, 
or buts about it. 
You are going to sign your name and 
attest to these issues. In fact, the at-
testation basically says, ‘‘Knowingly 
providing 
false 
information 
about 
yourself or the qualifications for voter 
registration is a class C felony, punish-
able by imprisonment or a fine up to 
$10,000, or both.’’ That is a pretty hefty 
fine. That is a pretty serious issue. I 
don’t think most people are going to 
say, ‘‘Oh, I want to help perpetrate 
voter fraud because I want to go to jail 
or I want to pay this fine.’’ 
And the notion that somebody ille-
gally in the United States is going to 
sign up for this—most of these people 
are just trying to earn an income and 
stay on a low profile. I don’t think any 
of them—if you are an illegal immi-
grant and you sign up for vote-by-mail 
and you vote-by-mail, you will be de-
ported. You will be deported. 
So I don’t think people are out there 
doing this voluntarily because they 
think this is some great way to gain 
the system. In fact, the statistics just 
done by a major report shows that 
there is less than 1 percent of voter 
fraud in this system. It is not really 
this notion that the former President 
would like to perpetrate. 
Well, the biggest reason why vote-by- 
mail works is what is here, but you 
don’t see it. I guess I should sign my 
name—because right here, I declare the 
facts on this registration form are 
true. I am a citizen of the United 
States. I live at this address, for at 
least the last 30 days before the elec-
tion which I am going to vote in. I am 
old enough to vote in that election, and 
I understand the jurisdiction of the De-
partment of Corrections; you can’t cur-
rently be serving a sentence for a fel-
ony conviction or incarcerated for a 
federally or out-of-state Federal con-
viction. 
OK. Right there, you have to sign 
your name right below that. So this at-
testation and requirement—oh, by the 
way, part of the requirement on the 
form that you get is you also have to 
put in your driver’s license or an I.D. 
Now, in many States, you are moving 
to this enhanced driver’s license re-
quirement, which you have to prove 
you are a citizen of the United States. 
Not every application you get at a 
driver’s license office you have to 
prove that, but this is the information 
on your voter registration card that 
you have to prove that you are attest-
ing to the fact that you are a citizen of 
the United States. It is information 
that can be searched. 
So, now, we come to the actual bal-
lot. I don’t know if we have a copy of 
the ballot here. Well, we will have to 
go grab one of those. But on your bal-
lot, you do the same thing. You get a 
ballot. Your ballot has to have that 
signature on it. You vote who you say 
you are going to vote for. You put it in 
a privacy envelope. You stick it in an-
other envelope. And you mail it in. So 
at the county auditor, they match that 
signature that you signed on your 
voter registration card with the signa-
ture on that ballot. And that is how 
they know you are who you say you 
are. 
Now, that is no different, really, from 
most of the way voting has worked in 
our country for decades. When you go 
into the polling place, they ask you for 
your name. You go to a book, if you no-
ticed, your name and address were 
there, in a blank space. And they say, 
Sign your name. 
Most Americans probably never no-
ticed at the top of that page was also 
an attestation that said, ‘‘If you are 
lying about who you are, yeah, you are 
going to pay a fine, and you are going 
to jail.’’ 
So when you went to a polling place 
and you signed your signature, they 
went back and saw it was the signature 
that you had on your registration card. 
So vote-by-mail is replicating that 
same system. An application card 
matched to a signature on your ballot. 
And that is what happened. 
Now, that is not to say there isn’t at-
tempts at fraud, not to say that there 
isn’t attempts at monkey business, be-
cause there is. But it says the system 
is based on something that is safe and 
secure and can be validated. I am going 
to shock some people, I am sure, by 
saying this, but when I went to vote in 
the last election, somebody had re-
quested several ballots in my name— 
several ballots in my name. I am sure 
it was ill intent. There was nothing 
good about it. 
And when I looked to see that they 
hadn’t counted my ballot, even though 
I had voted very early in the process, I 
became alarmed and called the auditor 
and said, ‘‘Why haven’t you counted 
my ballot?’’ 
And he said, ‘‘Several people have 
filed ballots under your name.’’ 
I am sure there was ill intent and 
monkey business by somebody. So I de-
cided I am going down to the court-
house to see what this was all about. 
But by the time I got there, the audi-
tor had sorted it out and said, ‘‘I found 
the one signature that matches your 
signature, and we have counted your 
ballot.’’ 
So if they hadn’t done that, they 
probably threw it in a pile—‘‘Oh, we 
got 10 ballots under this name’’—what-
ever it was. Why did that happen? I 
don’t know. But I know the system 
worked because he pulled them all 
aside and, when he got to it, they 
matched my name with the ballot that 
existed. 
Now, for us in Washington, because 
we have had some very close elections, 
the vote-by-mail system has got a lot 
of scrutiny. We got a lot of scrutiny in 
a Governor’s race a few years after I 
got elected, and the race got down to 
several hundred votes, really, I think 
in the end. It was several hundred 
votes. 
And we had people admitting that 
they had voted for dead spouses. We 
had all sorts of things at the end, when 
people knew that the level of—most 
elections aren’t that close. But when 
you are down to hundreds of votes and 
you know that there is going to be 
scrutiny, the system works. It doesn’t 
mean there won’t be a mistake some-
where and that you won’t have to redo 
the count and find it. It doesn’t mean 
that there is absolutely zero, zero, 
zero, zero fraud. 
It means that there is a system based 
on a safe and secure measure and that 
you can go back and check it. Now, I 
love our vote-by-mail system, and the 
voters are proving it, at 84 percent 
turnout in the last Presidential elec-
tion. Sometimes, in off-year elections, 
we get as high as 70 percent turnout. 
So it is working in off-year elections. 
Who is not for empowerment and en-
franchisement of people? Apparently, 
Newt Gingrich isn’t because he thinks 
it is a mastermind theory or some sce-
nario where we are going to try to take 
over the world when, in reality, I would 
say it is the next phase of voting, par-
ticularly in an era of pandemic and 
that we need to have our elections be 
more secure. 
I would say that if people are going 
to fool around and create distrust in 
your election system, have a system 
where you get to tear off a tab and 
keep it at home and know that your 
ballot was cast and know that you can 
count it and know that you can count 
it again. 
In my election when I won by 2,229 
votes, the tallies weren’t the same each 
time. They weren’t. It changed. It 
didn’t mean they were wrong. It just 
meant that various mistakes were 
made, they verified their work, and 
they were corrected. But my prede-
cessor did not undermine the U.S. de-
mocracy by claiming he lost. He didn’t 
go out and try to pass voter suppres-
sion laws. He came back here and 
worked on the 9/11 commission with all 
of us and tried to defend our country. 
But that is not where we are today. 
We are here with Mr. Trump—Presi-
dent Trump—and on January 6, I sat 
outside and listened to the President. I 
really thought, ‘‘I am going to go 
ahead and give a speech that night.’’ I 
had no idea what was going to happen 
to us. 
I thought I was just going to speak 
on the floor that night. I thought that

was it. I had no idea that we were going 
to face an insurrection. So I was taking 
notes, I thought I was going to give the 
speech. Turns out, I didn’t get to give 
that speech. We had kind of a trun-
cated session that night. We give a few 
speeches. A few people talked. But I 
didn’t give a big speech. 
I have been waiting to give this 
speech for a long time. I have been 
waiting to repudiate what the Presi-
dent said at his rally for a long time. 
And the reason is because I cannot 
stand to have our election system, the 
basis of our democracy, the basis of our 
country, why we are the gold standard 
around the world—I am not sure any-
body should go on a codel anymore to 
witness an election in another country 
until we get our election system right 
here. 
What are you going to say when you 
get there? What are you going to say if 
you are going to go to another country 
and witness their election? ‘‘We know 
how to do it in the United States’’? Be-
cause right now we are not proving 
that. We are showing that we can’t 
move forward on the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Act. 
Let’s go over what President Trump 
said 
that 
night 
because 
President 
Trump claimed that—his first claim 
that the Michigan secretary of state 
flooded the State with unsolicited 
mail-in ballots sent to everybody on 
the rolls in direct violation of State 
law. That is what he said last, that is 
what he said. That is what he said at 
his rally. ‘‘Go down there. Go down 
there.’’ 
You know, there is moments in this 
craziness when you realize there are 
people who will stand up. And I am not 
trying to embarrass anybody, but I was 
probably the last person to leave this 
Chamber, and the Parliamentarian re-
fused to let anyone touch the ballots, 
even though she could barely walk 
down the hall, even though she could 
barely carry all those supplies. 
She knew that allowing anybody else 
to touch these certifications of the 
election would give somebody the 
claim that, somehow, somebody had 
interfered. So people were doing their 
job, and in this case, the secretary of 
state, in response to a 2018 vote by the 
people of Michigan, they approved, in a 
vote by the people, a no-excuse absen-
tee voting law. That is what the people 
of Michigan voted for. 
So the secretary of state sent out 
ballots. Some people didn’t like that. 
Some people challenged it. And in Sep-
tember of 2020, the Michigan court of 
appeals upheld the decision that the 
secretary of state, citing the Constitu-
tion and their authority over elections, 
that they had the authority to mail 
those ballots. 
The supreme court of Michigan didn’t 
take up that case. They didn’t refute 
it. So it is false. He is trying to say 
mail-in ballot applications were ille-
gally sent. It is not true. The people 
voted for it. The secretary of state did 
her job. The courts upheld it. 
He tried to say 17,000 ballots were 
cast by deceased voters. OK. I mean, to 
say nothing of the fact that there are 
probably a lot of people with the name 
of John Brown in Michigan, there are a 
lot of people by the same name. But 
there is a system that uses the Social 
Security Administration to flag death 
of deceased voters. And ballots in this 
case of those who have died are not 
counted in the Michigan election. 
In the State of Washington, if you 
cast a ballot and you mailed it and you 
die 2 days later and the election is not 
until the next week, your vote counts. 
Now, your spouse can’t cast it after 
you die and say, ‘‘My wife intended to 
vote for so-and-so.’’ No, no, no. 
But once you fill the ballot out and 
you put it in the mailbox or ballot box, 
your vote is good, even if you die the 
next day. That is our State—in Michi-
gan, no. So they did not do this. They 
did not have this claim that the Presi-
dent had. 
And then he claimed the turnout in 
Wayne County was 137 percent of reg-
istered voters—or 139 percent, some-
where in there—also not true. In 
Wayne County, it was 61 percent of the 
vote of more than 1.4 million registered 
voters. So all that he said about Michi-
gan that night was false. It was false. 
And the courts upheld it. It was just a 
big lie. 
Let’s go to the Presiding Officer’s 
State. Let’s go to Wisconsin. Trump 
claimed 170,000 absentee ballots were 
counted without a valid absentee ballot 
application. Now, the President knows 
that her State is infamous—famous, 
appreciated, for the same-day voting. 
And in Milwaukee and Dane Counties, 
a total of 170,000 people did vote absen-
tee ballot, in person in the 2020 elec-
tion. 
They filled out an absentee ballot ap-
plication, located in the envelope like I 
showed, and sent in the ballot. So they 
know who those people are. They know 
that they were legitimate voters. They 
didn’t vote without an application. 
They filled out the application as well. 
So this, too, is part of the Big Lie. 
And then Trump claimed that 100,000 
ballots were backdated by U.S. Postal 
workers. That is what he claimed. The 
U.S. Postal Service Inspector General 
investigation to the allegations in all 
of the USPS workers and contractors 
refuted these allegations. There was no 
evidence—there was no evidence. There 
was no evidence that that occurred. 
And then the famous thing that the 
other side of the aisle constantly talks 
about—which I just don’t—I don’t un-
derstand—ballot 
harvesting. 
They 
think that, somehow, this is going to 
lead to ballot harvesting. 
So Donald Trump claimed that Madi-
son had 19,000 ballots collected by 
human dropboxes. I don’t even know 
what a human dropbox is. I don’t know 
what he means by a human dropbox or 
operatives. Well, facing influx, Madison 
and the city clerk held a pair of events 
in which people could go to a park and 
drop off their absentee ballots at sta-
tions set up and staffed by poll work-
ers. 
What is wrong with us if we are try-
ing to make it harder to vote in Amer-
ica? What is the premise? If the 
premise is that you want to certify 
that people are actual citizens of the 
United States, great. We have a sys-
tem. If you want to certify they live 
there, great. We have a system. We 
have a fine. We have a penalty. We 
have a way to investigate them. We 
have a way to catch fraud. 
So what is it? You just want to make 
it harder to vote? No, no, no. Democ-
racies are about enfranchising the 
vote. It is a constant effort. The same 
things we did in 1920 don’t apply in 
2020. In 2020, it is an information age, 
and we had a pandemic. 
What is wrong with making the vote 
available to people? So the ballot har-
vesting, that he claims, did not happen. 
That is also part of his speech that 
night. He went on for 45 minutes. He 
went on for 45 minutes, whipping peo-
ple up to come down here and attack 
the Capitol based on these lies that 
weren’t true—big lies that weren’t 
true. 
Then he went on to Georgia. He 
claimed over 10,000 ballots in Georgia 
were cast by individuals whose names 
and birth dates matched Georgia resi-
dents who died in 2020 prior to the elec-
tion. He later revised that down. He 
was like, ‘‘Oh, wait. No, that is too 
high.’’ He said it was 5,000. And the 
State election board in Georgia con-
ducted a comprehensive investigation 
of deceased voters submitting ballots 
and found four cases—four cases. Four 
cases. 
Again, I don’t know what Georgia’s 
law is. I don’t know if it is like Wash-
ington, I don’t know if it is like Michi-
gan’s, I don’t know what it is like but 
they found four people. But it wasn’t 
5,000; it wasn’t 10,000. Trump claimed 
that there were 66,000 people that were 
under the age of 18 who voted. 
I think this has gotten a lot of atten-
tion because I think there is been some 
public accounting of this in the press. I 
think the secretary of state refuted 
this several times. But in general, the 
secretary of state said that there were 
zero individuals under 18 who voted in 
the election based upon a comparison 
of people who voted in the 2020 election 
in Georgia to their full birth dates. So 
that also was refuted. 
And then Trump claimed—I showed 
you that attestation on the Wash-
ington ballot, the certification that 
you have to sign, what it says. You 
can’t vote if you are incarcerated or a 
felon. So Trump claimed that there 
were 2,500 ballots cast by incarcerated 
felons in Georgia prison. So there was 
no mass incarcerated voting of felons. 
They did investigate and did find 74 
potential felons who they think could 
have cast a ballot. And guess what hap-
pened? They pulled them, so they 
weren’t counted. That is how the sys-
tem works. That is how the system 
works. That is what you are supposed

to do. That is why you have the sys-
tem. So just like the other States—no, 
those voter claims were false. 
OK. Let’s go to Arizona, also another 
claim. He has made a lot of claims 
since then, but I am just focusing on 
the ones mostly from that evening be-
cause that is what sent people down 
here and, now, that is what sent us on 
where we are with candidates all across 
America pledging Trump-think to run 
for office, which is undermining our 
election system and undermining our 
democracy. And all I want is our col-
leagues to work together on the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act. That is all I 
want. 
This can’t be more tumultuous than 
1965. I am not saying that the former 
President isn’t stirring up a lot. He is. 
But I have got to believe that we can 
work together. So he said 36,000 ballots 
were illegally cast by noncitizens. 
Why am I going through this? Be-
cause I get a little tired of everybody 
just saying, ‘‘Oh, the courts decided. 
The courts decided. He was wrong, the 
courts decided. He was wrong.’’ 
No, no, no. People need to have faith 
in the system. We need to work to 
build faith in the system. We need to 
work in a bipartisan fashion to build 
faith in the system, and we need to 
stop the discrepancies between States. 
The 2020 turnout in Washington was 
87 percent; Alaska, 60 percent; West 
Virginia, 63 percent; Georgia, 66 per-
cent; and Wisconsin, 72 percent. I don’t 
know. I think it is probably a little 
higher. I don’t know. Preclearance was 
based on that there was 20 percent dif-
ference in States voting; 20 percent dif-
ference still exists today. How are we 
working to protect our democracy and 
enhance voting rights if we are here 
trying to suppress those rights through 
these various State actions? 
So in Arizona, the President said 
36,000 ballots were illegally cast by 
noncitizens. Well, I showed you that 
attestation that you have to sign that 
basically says you are going to jail or 
you are going to be deported or you are 
going to pay a fine. And in Arizona, the 
Supreme 
Court 
basically 
had 
pre-
viously struck down a law requiring 
that proof, and so they did submit 
proof of their—they do submit and at-
test to their citizenship. So they do at-
test to their citizenship, and since 
then, Arizona has further enhanced 
their laws. 
And 22,000 ballots were returned that 
were scheduled to be mailed out. I love 
this all the time—I love this all the 
time, this notion that, somehow, some-
body leaked a bunch of ballots, as if 
they all don’t have a barcode on them. 
They all have a barcode on them that 
you know where they are. They have a 
number attached to them. 
But because we have so many people 
who vote overseas or vote even here in 
the Washington, DC, area—some of my 
staff here get a ballot earlier than I 
would get a ballot at my home in Ed-
monds, WA, and the reason is because 
they know that they live here and it 
takes a long time to get the ballot and 
get it back to the secretary of state. 
So they are probably referring to bal-
lots that were being mailed out. The 
claim was really just a misreading of 
data that parties that mailed in the 
ballot on the first day that literally 
could have been overseas ballots before 
the ballots actually went out because a 
previous batch of ballots were already 
sent. 
There was a claim that there were 
more than 11,000 ballots cast, the num-
bers of registered voters in the same 
State in the 2020 election. The sec-
retary of state reported 3.4 million 
votes were cast out of 4.3 million reg-
istered voters for a turnout of 79 per-
cent. 
So there weren’t more—there might 
have been at some moment. I mean, 
one of the things that you see in close 
elections, particularly in our State be-
cause it takes a long time to count 
vote-by-mail, because, again, you are 
doing the verification of signatures, is 
counties will list how many ballots 
that they have left. No county ever 
overestimates how many ballots they 
have. 
They don’t know because you are 
still getting them in because of the 
vote-by-mail. Nobody says they have 
more ballots than they do because then 
everybody is going to say, ‘‘Where are 
those ballots,’’ so people underestimate 
the number of ballots. The consequence 
is you have different numbers that 
come in every day. 
It doesn’t mean there is something 
wrong with the system—the system, 
again, based on your signature, on your 
registration, 
on 
your 
attestation. 
Again, it is not to say there won’t be 
less than a decimal percent of 1 percent 
fraud. There will be some things that 
happen, but it is not pervasive to the 
system. And there is a way to catch 
them. There is a way to penalize them. 
And 150,000 voters were registered in 
Maricopa County without voter reg-
istration deadline—after the deadline 
had passed. And a Federal judge, basi-
cally, in that case, cited the impact of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, and there 
were 20,000 ballots that basically were 
registered after October 5. The court 
legally extended that deadline because 
of COVID–19. 
So the notion that these were all ille-
gal, you may not have liked the court 
decision—I know the former President 
does not like the court decision, but 
this is what the court decided in these 
cases. These are what voters decided, 
what States decided. He just doesn’t 
like the outcome of the system. 
And the reason why we are here 
today on the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Act and to try to pass these laws is be-
cause our country, based on a democ-
racy, 
knows 
that 
enfranchisement, 
voter enfranchisement, is something 
that we have to constantly be working 
for. I talked about a couple of compa-
nies earlier. I would like to talk about 
a few more, if I could. 
The reason I am saying this is be-
cause, right now, we need to unite the 
free press, the business community, the 
general public, everybody we can, to 
say, Let’s get behind free and fair elec-
tions. Let’s get behind the verification 
of the system. And let’s strengthen the 
democracy we have in the United 
States of America. 
But what did Best Buy say? They 
support the John Lewis Act. They say, 
‘‘An election cannot be free or fair if 
every eligible voter is not given a full 
chance to vote or if the law exists that 
make it harder for them to do so.’’ 
Michael Dell basically said, ‘‘Those 
rights, especially for women, commu-
nities of color, have been hard-earned. 
Government 
should 
ensure 
citizens 
have their voices heard. HB–6 does the 
opposite, and we are opposed to it.’’ 
PayPal, an organization, said, ‘‘The 
passage of the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act of 2021 is 
pending now in the U.S. Senate and 
will be an important step towards mak-
ing free and fair access to voting a re-
ality for all.’’ 
These are all corporations who know 
the importance of doing business in the 
United States, the importance of a de-
mocracy, and they have to be scared 
about what they are seeing. They got 
people coming up on stages in rallies 
all over the United States basically 
saying, ‘‘I will overturn the 2020 elec-
tion.’’ 
Do you think people want to do busi-
nesses in countries like that? No. Peo-
ple want to do business in stable coun-
tries where you have a free and fair 
election and you keep going. That is 
the beauty of the democracy—the peo-
ple have spoken, as I talked about ear-
lier. 
Microsoft, they are really trying to 
rally everybody: ‘‘We hope that compa-
nies will come together and make it 
clear that a healthy business requires a 
healthy community. A healthy commu-
nity requires that everyone have the 
right to vote conveniently, safely, and 
securely.’’ 
So they obviously get it. They know 
what this is about. 
Salesforce, 
another 
organization, 
they basically have said, ‘‘As voting 
rights have come under attack in 
places like Georgia and Texas, we have 
used our platform to advocate for the 
right to vote based on nonpartisan 
principles and action.’’ 
Let’s go, the Greater Phoenix Lead-
ership—GPL—‘‘Disenfranchising voters 
is not election reform. These efforts 
are misguided and must be defeated.’’ 
And this was in an op-ed opposing Ar-
izona Senate bills 1485, 1593, and 1713. 
And it was signed by 50 Arizona busi-
ness leaders. The reason I am saying 
this is because these businesses right 
now are leading the charge on efforts 
to try to stop these voter suppression 
tactics in States, and they are trying 
to tell us, ‘‘Hey, you guys do the same 
thing here, please. You guys please join 
the effort and do the same thing here, 
please.’’ 
There is another—well, Coca-Cola, I 
think they have been pretty clear, al-
though we should see what they say.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S249 
January 18, 2022 
This is a statement on Georgia’s voting 
legislation. They say, ‘‘We want to be 
crystal clear and state unambiguously 
that we are disappointed in the out-
come of Georgia’s voting legislation. 
Our focus is now supporting Federal 
legislation that protects voting access 
and addresses the voter suppression 
across the country.’’ 
Major League Baseball, they have 
been pretty clear on this. There is been 
quite a debate about this. It hap-
pened—you know, I don’t know what is 
going to happen this week. I don’t 
know what is going to happen. But I 
know when we raised questions about 
the Washington Football Team and 
spoke directly to the team, we said, 
‘‘This is the wrong approach. You need 
to change.’’ They said, ‘‘We don’t want 
to.’’ 
In the end, the business community, 
supported by many Native American 
organizations, the business community 
told the Washington team it was time 
to change. So the business community 
is telling us here, Do not suppress the 
rights of voters in the United States of 
America. 
So we may not be successful here, 
but I guarantee you the business com-
munity will continue to be loud about 
this because they know that voter sup-
pression and undermining democracy is 
undermining 
healthy 
communities 
here in the United States. 
So ‘‘Major League Baseball fun-
damentally supports the rights for all 
Americans and opposes restrictions at 
the ballot box.’’ 
And the Black Economic Alliance, 
this was a statement on the Georgia 
voting legislation signed by 72 Black 
economic and business leaders: ‘‘While 
the use of police dogs, poll taxes, lit-
eracy tests and other overtly racist 
voter suppression tactics are a thing of 
the past, Georgia and other States are 
rushing to impose new and substantial 
burdens on voting laws following an 
election that produced record turnout 
for both parties. The disproportionate 
racial impact of these allegedly ‘neu-
tral laws’ should neither be overlooked 
nor excused. The stakes for our democ-
racy are too high to remain silent or 
on the sidelines.’’ 
So all of these organizations—I want 
to just end with one last one, the Civic 
Alliance. The Civic Alliance is an orga-
nization signed by 1,200 member com-
panies that basically said: ‘‘If our gov-
ernment is going to work for us, for all 
of us, each of us must have equal free-
dom to vote, and elections must reflect 
the will of the people. We cannot elect 
leaders in every state capital and Con-
gress to work across the aisle. We call 
on elected leaders in every capital and 
in Congress to work across the aisle 
and ensure that every eligible Amer-
ican has the freedom to easily cast 
their ballot and participate fully in our 
democracy.’’ 
So these are the statements of people 
who are ringing the bell of concerns 
about voter suppression across the 
United States of America. These are 
the people who are saying it is time for 
us to act. They are not saying, Figure 
it out in a few years. They are not say-
ing, This is something you can deal 
with later. They are asking us to act 
now. 
Usually, the business community 
doesn’t get that involved in stating 
legislation by House and Senate bill 
numbers. They usually don’t do that. 
They are usually a little more reticent. 
They are not reticent now because they 
know doing business in a democracy is 
way better than in some scenario of 
voter suppression. 
So I ask my colleagues to join us in 
getting this done. I see my colleague 
who has been the leader on this effort 
overall, the Senator from Minnesota, 
and I thank her for her leadership on 
this issue. This has been a hard-fought 
battle and something she has put a lot 
of energy into, and I want to person-
ally thank her for that leadership and 
continuing to fight this fight. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Minnesota. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I first want to thank my colleague 
from the State of Washington, Senator 
CANTWELL, for her passion for people 
and the rights of people to vote, and 
her willingness to actually go through 
the details of the groups outside of this 
Congress that feel so strongly about 
this, including businesses, as pointed 
out, that understand that you can’t do 
business overseas—having just come 
back from Ukraine, from which I just 
arrived an hour ago—and uphold de-
mocracies overseas, if we are allowing 
our democracy to go to shambles by al-
lowing voter suppression laws to pass, 
as they have in numerous States across 
the country. 
Just this week, we marked the life 
and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr., and, today, we are considering leg-
islation that goes to the very heartbeat 
of the democracy—the freedom to 
vote—that so many have fought and 
died for. 
We are here because a flood of State 
laws to roll back voting has surged up 
since the 2020 elections, when in the 
2020 elections, in the middle of a pan-
demic, more Americans cast a ballot 
than ever before. They were willing to 
take those risks, and the laws were 
changed in red States and blue States 
and purple States to allow them to do 
that. 
But now what do we see? A rollback. 
A rollback in the Presiding Officer’s 
great State of Wisconsin. We see 
rollbacks attempted across the Nation 
in places like Montana, with same-day 
registration in place for 15 years. And 
8,000 people took avail of it in the last 
election to either change their address 
or register that way. 
So then what happens? Well, say the 
Republican 
legislature 
in 
Montana 
says: Why don’t we get rid of some-
thing we have had in place for 15 years? 
Why don’t we do that? 
Guess what that creates, my friends. 
Maximum 
confusion 
and 
ultimate 
voter suppression. 
With that core freedom of voting now 
at stake, it is on us to stand up and to 
take up the torch that Dr. King and so 
many brave Americans carried decades 
ago 
and 
acted 
to 
preserve 
the 
foundational right of our democracy. 
And while that may sound like an am-
bitious task, it is one within our reach. 
By passing the Freedom to Vote: John 
R. Lewis Act, we can meet these chal-
lenges and turn back the tide. 
Today, I want to address a topic that 
has loomed large over this historic de-
bate, and that has to do with the very 
rules of this Chamber. 
This week, every Member of the Sen-
ate will have a chance to cast a vote 
that will determine if this is a legisla-
tive body that will rise to meet a test. 
The test is participation and voting. 
The test is actually being able to take 
on the issues of our day. 
It won’t be the first time. Indeed, 
four times already this Congress, our 
Republican colleagues have blocked us 
from even considering legislation to 
protect the freedom to vote. But we are 
here again this week. We are here be-
cause, to quote Ella Baker, a grand-
daughter of slaves from Virginia who 
worked alongside some of the great 
leaders of the civil rights movement, 
‘‘We who believe in freedom cannot 
rest.’’ 
So while much has been made of our 
colleagues who have not committed to 
join us in this effort to change the Sen-
ate rules, we must remain steadfast in 
the truth that the right to vote in this 
country is not negotiable. We must 
forge ahead. 
I want to start by responding to some 
of the points that have been raised as 
reasons not to move forward with legis-
lation at this watershed moment, as 
reasons not to do what it takes when it 
comes to protecting this most sacred of 
rights—the right to vote. 
Some have argued that allowing vot-
ing rights legislation to pass the Sen-
ate without clearing a 60-vote thresh-
old would be a mistake that would 
open the door to somehow leading to 
wild swings in Federal policy. I am try-
ing to imagine this place ever being in-
volved in such a thing given how slow-
ly we go and how many people under-
standably want to make sure we are 
careful in how we pass laws, but that is 
one of the things that have been raised 
for why we need some kind of a 60-vote 
threshold, which, of course, is not in 
the Constitution. The words ‘‘fili-
buster’’ and ‘‘cloture’’ are not in the 
Constitution. 
In 
fact, 
legislatures 
across this land, some of which do very 
good things, do not use a 60-vote 
threshold. In fact, democracies across 
the world do not use a 60-vote thresh-
old. 
The truth is this: We have tried for 
months to persuade our Republican 
colleagues to join us in supporting leg-
islation, to work with us, to debate it,

but what they do is they throw a 
wrench into the process and then basi-
cally walk out that door and go home. 
We don’t have that debate that allows 
us to have amendments and allows us 
to ultimately have a vote on the bill. It 
is cut off from a vote. 
When you look at the past when it 
comes to voting rights, it has been bi-
partisan not even that long ago. But 
this time—this time—even reauthor-
izing the Voting Rights Act, something 
that has been law of the land and sup-
ported on a bipartisan basis, as the 
President of the United States pointed 
out when he was in Atlanta—this time, 
no. Only one Republican, Senator MUR-
KOWSKI of Alaska, was willing even to 
allow the John Lewis bill to come up 
for a vote. 
But if our colleagues across the aisle 
will not work with us, it does not 
mean—it cannot mean—that we should 
simply give up. A simple look at his-
tory makes that clear. 
As 
Representative 
CLYBURN
has 
noted in recent weeks, there have been 
moments in our history when this most 
fundamental of rights has not been ex-
tended or defended on a bipartisan 
basis; that is, the right to have these 
bills come up. He pointed to the 15th 
Amendment. That, as he said, was a 
single-party vote that gave Black peo-
ple the right to vote. That fact does 
not make the 15th Amendment any less 
legitimate. 
I would also say to my colleagues 
that the real threat facing our country 
isn’t too much legislation; it is the 
gridlock and the stalemate in which 
this Chamber is stuck. 
A number of us were just in Ukraine 
standing up for democracy, standing up 
for the right of people across the world 
to be able to debate issues and make 
decisions on the most pressing issues of 
this time. Now we are back here in this 
Chamber, and we have to have that op-
portunity as well. 
This misses another key point in the 
arguments made against changing the 
rules. When politicians actually have 
to vote on stuff, voters can hold them 
accountable for these votes. 
We know that the policies in the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act 
enjoy strong support among the Amer-
ican people. They have been adopted in 
red, blue, and purple States. 
Look at places like Utah, where for 
years there has been mail-in balloting. 
Yet, in other States, sadly, it is really 
hard to do. In other States, you have to 
get a notary just to get an application 
or you have to get a witness just to get 
an application even if you have COVID 
and you are in a hospital. Yet, in many 
States—red, blue, purple—this is in 
place. 
We believe—those of us who support 
the Freedom to Vote Act—that in 
keeping with the Constitution that 
says Congress can make or alter the 
laws regarding Federal elections, that 
this should be the law of the land. It is 
constitutionally supported, and Ameri-
cans, no matter what their ZIP Code, 
should have the right to vote in a safe 
way that is best for them. 
Arguing that Senate rules are more 
important than the right to vote ig-
nores the very history of this Nation. 
As Senator ANGUS KING has reminded 
us, in 1890, Henry Cabot Lodge intro-
duced a bill to ensure African Ameri-
cans in the South were not disenfran-
chised. The bill was passed in the 
House but was blocked by the Senate 
with a filibuster. Lodge argued that 
the Senate should get rid of the fili-
buster, saying: 
To vote without debating is perilous, but 
to debate and never vote is imbecile. 
I think that kind of says it all quite 
directly. 
The Senate chose not to change its 
rules, and due to repeated filibusters in 
the 
years 
that 
followed, 
Congress 
couldn’t pass legislation to enforce the 
15th Amendment until nearly 70 years 
later through the Civil Rights Act of 
1957. 
We have also heard that allowing one 
party to insist on virtually unlimited 
debate so that you can’t vote is an es-
sential part of the Senate, but experts 
from both parties have said this isn’t 
true. 
Marty Gold, a respected expert on 
Senate rules who worked for Repub-
lican Leader Howard Baker and was 
staff director of the Senate Rules Com-
mittee, has written: 
The possibility that a minority of Senators 
could hold unlimited debate on a topic 
against the majority’s will was unknown [in] 
the first Senate. 
Those are his words. 
Others have argued that requiring a 
supermajority, as this filibuster does 
now, to pass legislation was an inten-
tional effort to foster compromise, but, 
again, the historical record simply 
doesn’t back that up. 
The Constitutional Convention heard 
but did not adopt a proposal to require 
a supermajority for legislation. The 
Framers explicitly decided to reserve 
supermajority requirements for things 
like constitutional amendments, trea-
ties, and impeachment. 
To quote one of them, Benjamin 
Franklin wrote that a system where 
‘‘the minority overpowers the major-
ity’’ would be ‘‘contrary to the com-
mon practice of assemblies in all coun-
tries and ages.’’ 
Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter to 
James Madison: 
It is my principle that the will of the ma-
jority should always prevail. 
James Madison was a fierce defender 
of minority rights, but in 1834, even he 
wrote: 
The vital Principle of Republican Govern-
ment is . . . the will of the majority.’’ 
Listening to those words, does it 
really seem like the Framers of our 
Constitution 
envisioned 
a 
system 
where a minority of Senators could 
stand in the way of legislation and stop 
it altogether—stop the vote, stop the 
consideration, throw a wrench into the 
process, take it off the rails—and then 
just walk out the door and go home? 
That is not what they envisioned. 
I also want to be clear. Updating the 
Senate rules to meet the needs of this 
moment isn’t some radical break with 
past precedence. Throughout the Sen-
ate’s history, when faced with unre-
lenting obstruction from the minority, 
the majority has, in fact, changed the 
Senate rules to allow matters to con-
clude, to be voted on, not to hang in 
abeyance in perpetuity. In fact, since it 
was first established in 1917, the clo-
ture rule has been revised multiple 
times to make it easier to end debate 
and to force a vote. 
Now, for friends watching at home, 
this is what it means: A cloture motion 
is what allows Senators to bring some-
thing to a vote, and under the current 
rules, it takes 60 Senators to open de-
bate or to pass a bill. 
Here are some examples of how the 
cloture rule has changed over time: 
In 1949, cloture was extended to cover 
all issues pending before the Senate, 
not just bills. 
In 1975, the vote threshold for cloture 
was reduced to three-fifths of all Sen-
ators. 
In 1979, total postcloture debate was 
limited to 100 hours, and then it was 
limited again to 30 hours in 1986. 
In the past decade, the cloture rule 
has been further reduced for various 
kinds of nominees, most recently by 
our Republican colleagues across the 
aisle. This isn’t something from 100 
years ago. This isn’t something from 
before we had cars and people were ar-
riving here on horseback. This just 
happened. 
In addition to changes to the cloture 
rule itself, the Senate has put in place 
exceptions to the rule. In fact, over 
time, the Senate has established over 
160 processes and statutes that allow a 
final vote without requiring 60 votes 
for cloture to end debate; in other 
words, you get to a vote without the 60 
votes. 
As a result, we have expedited proce-
dures, including—get this—reconcili-
ation to pass spending and tax legisla-
tion; the Congressional Review Act to 
block regulations; disapproval of arms 
sales. I guess someone decided that was 
OK to do for less than 60 votes. Even 
approving compensation plans for com-
mercial space accidents doesn’t require 
60 votes, my friends. 
But while the 60-vote threshold was 
carved up 160 times so Senators could 
pass things like tax cuts under Presi-
dent Trump, block regulations, and 
confirm Supreme Court Justices, when 
it comes to voting rights, we are told 
that tradition and comity mean that 
we should hug it tight—this old rule— 
throw voters under the Senate desks, 
and go home. 
It is no wonder that our Republican 
colleagues 
support 
for 
the 
60-vote 
threshold rings hollow when their pri-
orities, such as tax cuts and a Supreme 
Court nominee, can be passed with a 
simple majority. 
Time and time again, the majority in 
the U.S. Senate has had to change the

rules to help pass major legislation. As 
Senator MERKLEY has noted time and 
time again, bills we have passed after 
the majority has modified the rules in-
clude the Natural Gas Policy Act in 
1977; funding for the Selective Service 
System in 1980; deficit reduction legis-
lation in 1985; a moratorium on listing 
new species under the Endangered Spe-
cies Act in 1995; and a change made by 
the majority in 1996 to the reconcili-
ation process, which paved the way for 
the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts and the 
2017 
Trump 
tax 
cuts. 
When 
cir-
cumstances 
change, 
Senators 
have 
changed the rules time and time again. 
All of this history clearly shows that 
the Senate rules are not chiseled in 
stone. That is probably a good thing 
because the people out there need us to 
do our jobs. And maybe that is more 
important than some archaic rule that 
someone is now abusing. They are not 
an outside force, these rules, over 
which we have no control. They are our 
rules—the Senators’ rules, yes, but also 
the 
people’s 
rules—written 
and 
changed over the years by Senators 
representing the people of this country, 
just like the ones sitting in this Cham-
ber today. 
As we move forward, I want to make 
clear that I agree with my colleagues 
who have said that we must keep the 
history of this institution in mind. By 
the way, I just gave you the history of 
this institution—160 carve-outs; time 
and time again when the rules have 
changed. That is the true history of 
this institution. 
History plainly allows for just this 
type of action that our democracy now 
demands. If we acknowledge the stakes 
when it comes to protecting the free-
dom to vote, the cornerstone of our de-
mocracy, and we acknowledge the his-
tory of the rules of this body, I am left 
with a simple conclusion: We must up-
date, change, and improve our rules to 
restore the Senate and meet the mo-
ment of our times. 
Our Nation was founded on the ideals 
of democracy, and we have seen for 
ourselves in this building how we can’t 
afford to take that for granted. I cer-
tainly 
saw 
that 
this 
weekend 
in 
Ukraine. We cannot afford to take any 
democracy for granted. 
The world is watching us—watching 
to see how America is taking on the 
challenges of the 21st century, includ-
ing the threats to our democracy. 
Around the globe, there are those who 
see weakness as an opportunity. They 
see weakness in our democracy as an 
opportunity for them. Those who are 
hoping that gridlock and paralysis are 
the defining features of America—they 
are out there, and you can imagine 
what world leaders I am thinking of 
right now. 
To put it simply, if we are going to 
effectively compete with the rest of the 
world, we need a Senate that can do 
more than just respond to crises. We 
are pretty good at that—tornadoes, 
hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, financial 
crises, pandemics. OK. We respond to 
that. But what about the long-term 
challenges that slowly but surely are 
eroding this democracy with voter sup-
pression? There is so much at stake 
here. We must get this done.

FILIBUSTER 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I was 
asked recently what I think is the No. 
1 issue facing America. It is a tough 
question, and I have had a lot of issues 
race through my mind: inflation, the 
debt, workforce issues, the crisis at our 
southern 
border, 
the 
explosion 
of 
COVID cases, the deadly opioid epi-
demic, a warming planet, Russia and 
China flexing their muscles and cre-
ating more volatility around the world. 
We have got plenty of challenges, don’t 
we? But do you know what I landed on, 
what I think is our biggest problem? It 
is the increasing division—even polar-
ization—of our politics and our coun-
try. It is what makes it so hard to ad-
dress all of those other issues that I 
named that are so important to the 
families whom we represent. 
Last week, on the Senate floor, my 
Democratic colleague from Arizona, 
Senator SINEMA, called it a disease of 
division. Well put. When we are to-
gether, this country can achieve great 
things and has over the years. It can 
provide a beacon of hope to a troubled 
world, but as Lincoln warned, ‘‘a house 
divided against itself cannot stand.’’ In 
this body, we should be figuring out 
how to come together to help America 
stand—and stand strong—to address 
our many challenges. 
That is why I am so discouraged 
about what I see playing out on the 
U.S. Senate floor again this week. I 
have seen an attempt by Democratic 
leadership to fan the flames of distrust. 
I see an attempt to further divide an 
already splintered country, both by ex-
aggerated arguments being made to ad-
vance controversial legislation opposed 
by every single Republican regarding 
the tough issue of voting and then to 
try to achieve this purely partisan ob-
jective by changing a foundation of the 
Senate to dismantle the one Senate 
rule—the 
legislative 
filibuster—that 
works to bring us together rather than 
pull us apart. 
Equally troubling to me is that this 
seems to be a purely political exercise 
now in that the conclusion seems pre-
determined. Apparently, the Senate is 
being dragged through this divisive and 
ugly partisan debate, knowing that it 
will not achieve a legislative result but 
only a deepening and hardening of the 
political lines in each camp. 
Here in the Senate, most Republicans 
and most Democrats say they want to 
bring the country together. I think 
they are sincere about that. This mes-
sage was an explicit part of President 
Biden’s campaign for President. Yet 
there is nothing about the harsh, par-
tisan rhetoric from the President’s 
speech on this topic in Atlanta last 
week or from much of the floor debate 
this week and last week that does any-
thing but push our country further 
apart. 
First is the substance of the legisla-
tive fight. Democrats have been highly 
critical 
of 
those 
Republicans 
who 
refuse to accept the results of the 2020 
election, pointing out accurately that 
dozens of lawsuits failed to show ade-
quate fraud to change the result. They 
have attacked some Republicans be-
cause they have said that the election 
was rigged and for questioning the 
State-by-State 
certification 
process 
that has led to deeper rifts in our Na-
tion and a significant number of Re-
publican voters questioning the legit-
imacy of the election. I get that. 
So why now are Democratic leaders 
and President Biden using the exact 
same language, literally saying the 
elections are rigged—literally saying 
that? Why are they perpetrating their 
own election narrative that does not fit 
the facts but serves to push both sides 
deeper into their own camps and, in 
particular, now leads Democrats to 
think that elections are illegitimate? 
Majority 
Leader 
SCHUMER
claims 
‘‘Republicans are pushing voter sup-
pression 
and 
election 
nullification 
laws.’’ 
President Biden has compared State 
efforts to tighten up election adminis-
tration to Jim Crow laws. He has com-
pared Republicans to notorious racists 
in our history. These attacks are over-
wrought, exaggerated, and deeply divi-
sive. 
Here is what the nonpartisan and re-
spected group called No Labels has said 
about the Democratic attacks: 
If you dig into these [state legislative] pro-
posals you find most entail tightening up 
procedures pertaining to registration, mail- 
in absentee voting and Voter ID [laws] that 
were loosened in 2020 in the name of making 
it safer for people to vote amid the COVID 
pandemic. Many leading Democrats and lib-
eral commentators have taken to describing 
these measures as Jim Crow 2.0, which is to 
say they are somehow worse than the origi-
nal Jim Crow era, which entailed poll taxes 
and literacy tests, violent intimidation of 
Black voters by the KKK, and even outright 
prohibition on Black voters participating in 
party primaries in southern States. To sug-
gest that any voting measures being debated 
today in America are somehow worse than 
this is simply irresponsible demagoguery. 
That comes from No Labels, which is 
a nonpartisan group, Democrats and 
Republicans, trying to find that middle 
ground. 
Now, to be fair, this group has been 
critical of Republican claims of wide-
spread election fraud that cannot be 
backed up. So what are the actual 
facts?

all citizens 18 years of age or older the

right to vote in elections regardless of 
race or gender—period. 
The Federal Voting Rights Act reaf-
firms that right and makes it enforce-
able in Federal court. In 2006, Congress 
voted in a bipartisan way to reauthor-
ize this important law for 25 years, 
through 2031. I voted for and strongly 
support the Voting Rights Act and 
have long supported other common-
sense efforts to increase voter con-
fidence in our elections. 
In fact, there is a bipartisan effort 
underway right now to deal with a real 
problem: to ensure that after the fact, 
certified elections are respected. This 
will require making overdue reforms to 
the Electoral Count Act and some 
other reasonable updates to Federal 
election procedures. I am happy to be 
working with a small group of Senate 
Democrats and Senate Republicans on 
those efforts. That is how the system 
should work. We are not going to agree 
on everything, but we can sit down and 
talk and find common ground to ad-
dress problems. 
What Republicans and most Ameri-
cans don’t support is an unprecedented 
Federal takeover of our election sys-
tem, which is what the overly broad 
party-line bills proposed this week by 
the Democrats will do. 
Let me be clear. Despite what Demo-
cratic leaders are saying to jam these 
bills through Congress, our democracy 
is not, as they say, in crisis because it 
is too hard to vote. We just had a na-
tional election in 2020 with the highest 
voter turnout in 120 years. Ninety-four 
percent of voters said it was easy for 
them to vote. This is according to the 
Pew Research Center—94 percent. That 
is good. 
Some have said drastic changes are 
needed at the Federal level because the 
States are now enacting voter restric-
tions. Some point to the liberal Bren-
nan Center, which reports that 19 
States have enacted laws which it 
characterizes as restricting the right 
to vote. As noted above—again, by the 
nonpartisan No Labels group—when 
you really look at these laws, the truth 
is that they largely make modest 
changes in election law administra-
tion, such as the date that voters may 
apply for mail-in ballots or ensuring 
voters are who they say they are 
through voter ID and other signature 
requirements—something, by the way, 
the vast majority of Americans sup-
port. 
Some of the laws return to State 
practices closer to the status quo be-
fore the pandemic. As an example, 
some laws reduced the number of ballot 
drop boxes in cases where there were 
no ballot drop boxes before COVID. And 
many of the States the Democrats 
criticize for improving their elections 
process are enacting laws similar to 
those that have long been in place in 
States represented by Democrats, so- 
called blue States. 
For example, under its new law, 
Georgia has a limit of 17 days of in-per-
son early voting, 17 days. New Jersey 
and New York have 9 days of in-person 
voting. Connecticut doesn’t have any 
early voting. Georgia has also added 
one extra Saturday of early voting. 
Georgia’s new requirement that voters 
provide their driver’s license or State 
ID numbers when applying for mail-in 
ballots, which Democrats have criti-
cized, is the same as laws in Maryland 
and Pennsylvania. Rhode Island en-
acted a voter ID law a decade ago. And 
with regard to President Biden’s home 
State, The Atlantic has noted that 
‘‘few states have more limited voting 
options than Delaware.’’ 
I, frankly, have not heard Demo-
cratic leadership calling out any of 
these Democrat-majority States for 
pushing what they deem to be voter 
suppression. 
I don’t know anyone who doesn’t be-
lieve it should be easy to vote and hard 
to cheat. Every State has to find that 
balance, but they have to find it while 
not violating the Voting Rights Act. 
I don’t agree with every policy every 
State has in place. I find some too re-
strictive. As an example, I support no- 
fault absentee voting, as we do in Ohio. 
It works well. You don’t have to have a 
reason; you can vote absentee. I would 
like to see every mailbox, in a sense, be 
a ballot box, in essence. I find that 
some of the laws in some of the States 
lack adequate security, on the other 
hand. For example, I think some form 
of ID is smart, as do the vast majority 
of Americans. 
But in our Federal system, within 
the guardrails of the Voting Rights Act 
and consistent with the Constitution, 
that decision is left up to State legisla-
tors, closer to the people and account-
able to the voters. That is just a funda-
mental 
philosophical 
difference 
we 
have here on the Senate floor. We see it 
play out on lots of issues and now on 
this one. 
I am very proud of the job that my 
State of Ohio and our bipartisan elec-
tion officials in every county do in our 
elections. In the last election, we had a 
record 5.97 million Ohioans cast a 
vote—more voters than ever. It rep-
resented 74 percent of eligible voters in 
our State, the second highest percent-
age in the history of Ohio. Despite the 
challenges of running the highest turn-
out election in our State’s history, dur-
ing an unprecedented pandemic, it was 
widely regarded as the most secure and 
most successful Ohio election ever. 
Now is not the time to take the re-
sponsibility away from Ohio State and 
local officials. Article I, section 4 of 
the Constitution clearly assigns that 
authority over elections to the States. 
Alexander Hamilton acknowledged in 
Federalist 59 that only in extraor-
dinary circumstances should the Fed-
eral Government become involved in 
election law, explaining that allowing 
the Federal Government to run elec-
tions would have been a ‘‘premeditated 
engine for the destruction of State gov-
ernments.’’ 
We are not in extraordinary cir-
cumstances right now. In general, it 
has become easier and easier to vote in 
America, and that is a good thing. And 
it has become easier to vote in America 
than many other democracies around 
the world, and that is good too—easy 
to vote, hard to cheat. 
Despite all the fiery speeches on the 
floor stating the contrary over the past 
week, according to a recent survey 
from Morning Consult, only 33 percent 
of American adults think it is too hard 
for eligible voters to vote. A larger 
share—44 percent—actually think cur-
rent rules aren’t strict enough. Having 
heard the debate, this is what voters 
think. 
Not only are Democrats attempting a 
Federal takeover of our election sys-
tem, but because they have chosen to 
change the constitutionally based elec-
tion system in a purely partisan way, 
they don’t have the 60 votes necessary 
to get something passed here in the 
U.S. Senate. That is why instead of 
reaching out to find a bipartisan way 
forward, they are also proposing to fun-
damentally change the longstanding 
rules of the Senate. Specifically, they 
are proposing to do away with what is 
called the legislative filibuster in order 
to advance their Federal election take-
over bills by a simple majority instead 
of the normal 60 votes. 
This 60-vote margin, the legislative 
filibuster, is the one tool left to en-
courage bipartisanship not just here in 
the Senate but in our system, in the 
House and at the White House. Yes, it 
provides important minority rights in 
the Senate that protect the country 
from legislation that is too far out of 
the mainstream, and it helps pass good 
legislation, like Medicare or Social Se-
curity with big votes, big margins, that 
mean those programs can be sustained, 
and they can be relied upon. That is 
good for our country. 
Most importantly to me, the legisla-
tive filibuster is the one thing that en-
courages us to work in a bipartisan 
way. The successful passage of the bi-
partisan infrastructure law last year is 
a good example. I was in the middle of 
those negotiations. We knew we had to 
achieve 60 votes in a 50–50 Senate. 
What did that mean? That meant that 
we had to find common ground. We had 
to make concessions on both sides in 
order to get to 60 votes. As a result, we 
got well over 60—into the seventies— 
and a good piece of legislation was able 
to pass the House and be signed into 
law and is now in place, again, as sus-
tainable, reliable legislation. 
Did I agree with everything in it? No, 
nor did anybody else. But to get to 
those 60 votes, we all had to make cer-
tain concessions. 
Although it is a Senate rule, the leg-
islative filibuster also requires Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives to 
come up with more bipartisan solu-
tions because they know their legisla-
tion has to pass the Senate if they 
want it to become law. Just as I have 
been a committed, bipartisan legislator 
here in the Senate for the past 11 
years, the same was true in the House

for 12 years, where I regularly used the 
fact that we needed 60 votes in the Sen-
ate to force colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to come together and find a 
way to pass legislation in a bipartisan 
manner. When I was in the executive 
branch in two Cabinet-level jobs in the 
Bush 43 administration and as Director 
of the Office of Legislative Affairs for 
Bush 41, that 60-vote necessity in the 
Senate calmed the passions within the 
administration and forced us to find 
common ground to work in a more bi-
partisan manner, resulting in more ef-
fective results that last the test of 
time. I know the benefits to our coun-
try of requiring more than a bare Sen-
ate majority that shifts back and forth 
because I have lived it in the House, in 
the Senate, and in the White House. 
And it is not just me or other Repub-
licans now saying that the legislative 
filibuster is good for our Federal sys-
tem. Less than 5 years ago, 32 Senate 
Democrats, including then-Senator and 
now-Vice President Kamala Harris, 
joined with me and other Republicans 
in signing an open letter insisting the 
legislative 
filibuster 
should 
not 
change. This was at a time when there 
was a Democrat in the White House, 
but Republicans controlled the Senate. 
It appears that those 32 Democrats 
were happy to defend the filibuster as 
good for the country when they were in 
the minority but not now when the 
country is even further divided, and 
they have a majority. All but a couple 
of those Members have shifted their 
views. 
I would encourage my Democratic 
colleagues to reread their own letter, 
which makes such a compelling case 
that this is about the country, not 
about one political party or another. 
Back in 2005, Senator SCHUMER called 
abolishing the filibuster ‘‘a temper tan-
trum by those on the hard, hard right’’ 
who ‘‘want . . . their way every single 
time.’’ That was in 2005. Now he is ma-
jority leader, and he has changed his 
tune. 
This seems shortsighted to me, since 
the history of the Senate is to change 
the majority regularly. We don’t know 
who is going to be in the majority in 
the next Senate. 
Could the Senate rules be improved 
to 
allow 
more 
debate 
and 
more 
progress on legislation? Absolutely. 
There is bipartisan interest in this, and 
we should turn it to something con-
structive. After this political exercise 
we are going through right now, we 
should turn to the issue of reforming 
the rules around here. Let’s have each 
leader choose a few interested Mem-
bers. Let’s hammer out a bipartisan 
proposal that allows more amendments 
and makes it easier to get legislation 
passed. It is not that hard. But elimi-
nating the one tool that forces us to 
come together makes it harder to ad-
dress those many challenges we face. It 
makes it harder to pass legislation, 
broadly supported and sustainable, to 
actually help the people we represent. 
That is what we were elected to do. 
That is our job—not inflame the pas-
sions of our most committed and hard- 
line supporters but achieve results. 
And as I said at the outset, between in-
flation, and COVID, our southern bor-
der, and more, we have got plenty to 
do. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to 
step back from the brink, to think 
twice before trying to destroy what has 
made the U.S. Senate such a unique 
and valuable part of the world’s longest 
lasting and most successful democracy. 
And I urge my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle to support sensible rules 
changes and recommit to use the 60- 
vote margin responsibly to generate 
consensus and find that elusive com-
mon ground that will best serve those 
we represent and that will keep our 
great Republic the envy of the world. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

H.R. 5746 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
have just come back from a trip to 
Ukraine with six of my colleagues, a 
bipartisan group organized very ably 
by Senator PORTMAN and Senator SHA-
HEEN, to express our solidarity with the 
people of Ukraine in their fight for 
freedom and democracy against Rus-
sian aggression. 
They need us to stand with them as 
they stand strong for their country’s 
independence against Vladimir Putin’s 
effort to intimidate them, potentially 
to invade their country, but, assuredly, 
in a hybrid war consisting of misin-
formation, cyber attack, and military 
action that is designed very simply to 
destabilize, demoralize, and degrade 
their country’s governance. 
And as we stood with them, meeting 
with the President, Mr. Zelensky, and 
the top leadership, I couldn’t help but 
think of this country and how grateful 
we should be for our strength, our free-
dom, our democracy. 
All of us, when we return from travel 
abroad, I think, express our gratitude 
to be Americans, to live in a country 
where these freedoms and our inde-
pendence are assured but where we, 
too, need to be strong and ever vigilant 
and vigorous in protecting those free-
doms. 
We are the greatest Nation in the 
history of the world, the strongest and 
most freedom-loving on the planet. We 
are still an imperfect nation, still 
struggling to do better and a work in 
progress, but we are proud to confront 
our imperfection and move forward in a 
way that demonstrates that we can 
broaden access to opportunity and to 
the right of people to determine their 
own destiny. 
No freedom or right is more impor-
tant than the right to vote. That is 
why we are here today and why I am so 
proud to have helped to lead the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
and to support the Freedom to Vote 
Act, which are designed to safeguard 
Americans’ right to vote and secure 
the sanctity of our elections. 
And, today, just as Ukraine faces a 
threat to its independence and free-
dom, we too, in America, face a threat, 
not from Vladimir Putin directly, al-
though he has sought to destabilize and 
degrade our democracy and continues 
to do so through cyber attacks and 
misinformation. Certainly, 2016’s inter-
ference in our elections is a warning 
bell, an alarm, that we need to be 
stronger against foreign interference. 
But within, the threat is equally, if 
not more, alarming because what we 
are seeing across this great country in 
State after State are efforts to sup-
press the vote and restrict the fran-
chise. Last year, more than 440 restric-
tion bills were introduced in 49 States, 
and 19 of those States successfully en-
acted 34 laws that made it harder for 
people to vote. These laws make mail- 
in voting and early voting more dif-
ficult. They manipulate the boundaries 
of districts to reduce minority rep-
resentation and have led to a purge of 
3.1 million voters from the rolls in 
areas that were once covered by the 
Voting Rights Act preclearance re-
quirement. We are seeing a tidal wave 
of voter suppression that continues 
even as we speak today on this floor. 
The vote today comes in a week 
where we celebrate the legacy of Rev-
erend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. For 
the first time in my memory, I was out 
of the country on that day. But it was 
ever present in my mind and heart, and 
it should animate us today, that mem-
ory and legacy which were so power-
fully expressed on August 6, 1965, when 
President Lyndon Johnson signed the 
Voting Rights Act into law. He called 
it ‘‘a triumph for freedom as huge as 
any victory that has ever been won on 
any battlefield’’—a triumph for free-
dom. 
And it followed a mere 7 months 
after Dr. King launched a Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference cam-
paign based in Selma, AL, with the aim 
of supporting voting rights legislation. 
It was a great day for America. It is 
one that has, rightly, received a para-
mount place in our history. It is taught 
to our children. 
The Voting Rights Act represents the 
best of America, and its commitment 
to guaranteeing that members of every 
racial group would have equal voting 
opportunities stands as one of the best 
days in this country. But it was no 
layup for the civil rights movement. It

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S254 
January 18, 2022 
culminated a hard-fought campaign, 
and it was a hard-won victory of civil 
rights leaders like Dr. King and John 
Lewis, who committed themselves—lit-
erally, committed their bodies, their 
physical well-being—to advance the 
rights of others in the face of violent 
opposition. They were beaten, some-
times near death. 
And, for decades, the Voting Rights 
Act remained a crucial bulwark. It was 
retained and defended against insidious 
efforts to roll back the clock until— 
until—the U.S. Supreme Court did that 
work for opponents. In 2013, in Shelby 
County, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted 
the highly effective preclearance re-
gime, thereby jeopardizing the progress 
that the Voting Rights Act made over 
the course of half a century in pro-
tecting against those voter suppression 
efforts throughout the country. 
Justice Ginsburg said it best in her 
powerful dissent in Shelby County 
when she wrote that Congress enacted 
the Voting Rights Act preclearance re-
quirement ‘‘to cope with this vile in-
fection’’ of racial discrimination which 
‘‘resembled battling the Hydra. When-
ever one form of voting discrimination 
was identified and prohibited, others 
sprang up in its place.’’ 
And the time to protect those voting 
rights is before they are restricted, and 
that is why preclearance was so impor-
tant and why the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act now must be 
enacted into law. 
We come here after a year that has 
seen the most destructive legislative 
session for voting rights in genera-
tions, with States and localities re-
turning to the ‘‘conniving methods,’’ as 
Dr. 
King 
called 
them—‘‘conniving 
methods’’ of voter suppression that 
block people from getting to the polls 
and making their votes count—and un-
dermines our democracy because, as 
the Founders sought to do, representa-
tive government means representing 
the people who are affected by these 
policies enacted by the Federal Gov-
ernment. And that means representa-
tion that enables every person to vote 
and to have that vote count. 
There are no guarantees that rights 
will be protected in this country. The 
fight for voting equality has faced con-
tinuous, often violent resistance and 
enormous opposition, including from 
within this Congress, and now by a 
rule, a filibuster that will prevent the 
majority from protecting those rights. 
The effort to change the filibuster is 
very simply an effort to convert it 
from a secret to a public debate mecha-
nism—secret to public. We will vote to-
morrow on a rules change that provides 
for a means to make majority rule 
count—not to abolish the filibuster but 
to make it public instead of secret. 
As my distinguished colleague Sen-
ator WARNOCK posed the question in 
this Chamber last month, we want it to 
be bipartisan but, as he said, ‘‘biparti-
sanship at whose expense?’’ And as he 
also said, clearly in this country, 
‘‘some people don’t want some people 
to vote.’’ And the filibuster is a handy 
means of preventing reforms that se-
cure the right to vote. 
Historic denials of individual basic 
liberties and political freedoms have 
long garnered bipartisan support and 
have required courage and conviction 
to overcome, and that is why we must 
change the rules tomorrow. 
Dr. King never quit. He never stopped 
fighting. As he said—I think I am 
quoting him correctly—disappointment 
is finite, but hope is infinite. And so, 
even if we are defeated tomorrow, we 
will continue this effort to eliminate 
dark money, to provide for disclosure, 
to stop State legislatures from elimi-
nating districts in a way that knocks 
Representatives out of their seats and 
results in gerrymandering that is anti-
democratic. 
For decades, Members of this Cham-
ber have deployed the filibuster to 
delay and block legislation that would 
have promoted voting rights by ending 
poll taxes and literacy tests, safe-
guarded against workplace discrimina-
tion, and advanced civil rights in this 
country. The filibuster has been used 
to block those kinds of efforts to pro-
mote voting rights. 
The longest filibusters in this Cham-
ber’s history were deployed to stop the 
Civil Rights Act of 1957 and 1964, a tes-
tament to this tool’s history as a weap-
on against the advancement of civil 
rights. And Dr. King himself lamented 
that ‘‘tragedy [of] . . . a Senate that 
has a minority of misguided Senators 
who will use this filibuster to keep the 
majority of people from even voting.’’ 
We cannot continue to allow these 
kinds of procedural tactics to stand in 
the way of defending against a new era 
of hostility toward voting rights of 
people in this country. We must pro-
tect the right to vote. It should not be 
a partisan issue. 
In fact, voting rights are widely sup-
ported throughout American society. 
Those civil rights measures were sup-
ported by bipartisan majorities in 
those years of 1957 and 1964 and in the 
renewal since then. Photographs show-
ing Members of both parties at bill 
signing attest powerfully to the bipar-
tisan support this cause has enjoyed 
throughout its history. 
Since the original inception of the 
Voting 
Rights 
Act 
in 
1965, 
over-
whelming, 
bipartisan 
majorities 
of 
both Houses of Congress have reauthor-
ized the Voting Rights Act five times. 
For nearly a century after the Civil 
War and before the Voting Rights Act, 
the scourge of racial discrimination in 
voting challenged our Nation’s core 
commitment, our basic value as a 
country. 
From that century of sacrificing and 
suffering, so embodied by Dr. King, 
came the Voting Rights Act and its ex-
traordinary commitment to realizing 
our Nation’s highest ideals, the best in 
America. For decades, it worked. In 
one decision and its progeny, the U.S. 
Supreme Court undercut and under-
mined those rights, and now we face 
this tsunami of voter suppression bills 
crashing against America. 
We must defend America. We must 
secure those rights and liberties, just 
as we come to the aid of countries like 
Ukraine that resist attack on their 
independence. We must renew our Na-
tion’s commitment to protecting vot-
ing rights in this country. And tomor-
row, we will do it. Tomorrow, we will 
vote. Members will be held account-
able. We will be on record. And I hope 
my colleagues will do the right thing 
for America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to-
night to speak about the voting legisla-
tion that we are debating on the floor. 
Like so many of my Democratic col-
leagues, I rise along with those Demo-
cratic colleagues in calling for com-
prehensive Federal legislation to turn 
back the avalanche of voter suppres-
sion legislation in various States, all of 
it—all of it—animated by the Big Lie 
about the 2020 election. We will talk 
more about that in a moment. 
It is clear to me that Republican 
politicians across the Nation in State 
capitals and even here in Washington 
are attempting to make it harder for 
tens of millions of Americans to reg-
ister to vote, to cast their vote, and 
they are even making it harder, of 
course, for every vote to count. 
This is a subversive threat. It is a 
subversive threat to our democratic in-
stitutions. I believe it is a clear and 
present danger to our elections and 
also a clear and present danger to our 
stability as a nation, and, of course, it 
is a clear and present danger and a di-
rect threat to our democracy itself. 
Just by way of a significant example, 
consider what happened in just one 
State in the last couple of years, in 
Pennsylvania. I will start with a his-
torical backdrop. 
Pennsylvania, like a lot of States, 
had a high-water mark of voting in 1960 
in the election between John F. Ken-
nedy and Richard M. Nixon, and then 
in 1964, the numbers were very high as 
well. So in 1960, about right at—almost 
exactly 70 percent of the voting-age 
population voted, but after 1960 and 
1964, you had a precipitous drop that 
occurred every 4 years. Some years, it 
would go up a little higher; other 
years, it would go back down. But we 
never got, in 60 years, to that level 
again. 
For example, just the most recent 
two elections before 2020 in Pennsyl-
vania—in the 2012 election, 5.74 million

January 18, 2022 
people voted. That was 57 percent of 
the voting-age population, so down 
from that high-water mark of 70 per-
cent in 1960. Twenty-sixteen was a big 
turnout in our State. 
The year 2016 was a big turnout in 
our State. We had more voters than 
2012. It was 6.1 million voters, and it 
went from 57 in 2012 to 61, so it got over 
that 60 mark, but, of course, 61 is not 
70—so we got nowhere near, even in 
2016, when you look at the percent of 
the voting age population. That is the 
backdrop of 2016: big turnout but not 
the turnout level we saw in 1960 or 1964 
or a few other years. 
Then, in October of 2019—this is just 
an example of why the voting measures 
we are debating here are important in 
a positive way for helping people to 
vote. In October 2019, Governor Tom 
Wolf, in Pennsylvania, signed Act 77. 
This was a historic and comprehensive 
election reform bill that sailed through 
the general assembly with strong bi-
partisan support. 
Consider this: 133 Republicans voted 
for this bill, when you add up the num-
ber who voted in the State senate for 
this bill who were Republicans and 
then you add them to the number in 
the State house who were Republicans 
who voted for the bill. When you look 
at it across the whole general assem-
bly—both parties, both houses—about 
70 percent of the general assembly 
voted for it. So there is a lot of give- 
and-take and a lot of compromise, and 
they voted on a strong election reform 
bill. 
Remember, that was October of 2019, 
well before the onset of the pandemic. 
But thank goodness we had that bill in 
place during the pandemic. In addition 
to enhancing election security, the 
Pennsylvania law, so-called Act 77, es-
tablished ‘‘no excuse’’ absentee voting, 
better known today as mail-in voting. 
That applied to all voters. Finally, we 
had a mechanism that people could 
vote by mail, especially in a pandemic. 
But, of course, when they voted on 
the bill in 2019, no one could have pre-
dicted 
how 
useful 
this 
legislation 
would be just a year later. This law 
was passed before COVID, but, of 
course, it was in the face of a once-in- 
a-century pandemic during the runup 
to the 2020 election, but it proved to be, 
of course, particularly important. 
Now we get to 2020. We have had— 
over many, many years, many, many 
Presidential elections—nowhere near 
the percent of the voting-age popu-
lation voting in the Presidential elec-
tion compared to 1960 and 1964. 
What happened in 2020? In the middle 
of a pandemic, when everyone was pre-
dicting, not just in my home State of 
Pennsylvania but other places as well, 
that turnout is going to be low because 
people are worried. They are worried 
about—and this is, of course, before 
vaccines. They are worried about con-
tracting the virus. So they won’t vote; 
the turnout is going to be low; and we 
will see what happens. Well, it didn’t 
happen that way. 
In Pennsylvania, in 2020, 6.9 million 
people voted—6.9 million people. That 
is an increase of roughly 800,000 votes 
from just 4 years earlier, and that was 
a pretty good turnout, a really good 
turnout in 2016. That 6.9 million votes 
amounted to 71 percent of the voting- 
age population of Pennsylvania, which 
was a point higher than 1960. No one— 
no one—thought that was possible. The 
only way it was possible was because 
we had better voting procedures in 
place. 
In other words, if you look at it not 
just from 2016 to 2020 but even from the 
most recent election before 2016—2012, 
the 2012 election—the 2020 election 
from the 2012 was a 20-percent increase 
in voter turnout. So there can’t be any 
dispute that Pennsylvania’s record-set-
ting 71-percent turnout was made pos-
sible only through expanding opportu-
nities to vote for all voters—all voters 
young and old and so many others in 
between. Mail-in voting enabled almost 
3 million Pennsylvanians to safely and 
securely cast their ballot. 
By 
any 
measure, 
Pennsylvania 
should be celebrated as a success story 
of why these voting provisions help 
people vote. I hope that we never fall 
below that 71 percent of the voting-age 
population. That ought to be the stand-
ard for voting in a pandemic or not. In 
fact, that number should go higher 
when we are outside of the pandemic 
because people have different ways to 
vote. 
A Republican-controlled legislature 
and a Democratic Governor came to-
gether and enacted strongly supported 
bipartisan election reform legislation 
to increase election security and ballot 
access. 
Unfortunately, we know that the 
story doesn’t end there. We all know 
what happened in the next chapter, and 
it is not unique to Pennsylvania. In re-
sponse to the 2020 election, we have 
seen a new chapter, one focused on 
election subversion and voter suppres-
sion written in statehouses across the 
country. Again, it is attributable to 
the Big Lie about the 2020 election. 
I want to note for the record that 
when we voted here on January 6, the 
evening of January 6, 2020—after the 
violent insurrection in the Capitol 
where we had people marching through 
this building, calling for the death of 
the Vice President, trying to locate 
Members of Congress to bring them 
harm, and also the whole effort was di-
rected at stopping the counting of the 
electoral votes—but I want to note for 
the record that a number of Republican 
Senators, in fact, most Republican 
Senators, stood up on January 6 that 
evening to vote to certify the election. 
Unfortunately, since January 6 of 
2020, despite having voted the right 
way for democracy that night, a lot of 
these Republican Senators since then 
have only validated the Big Lie. They 
may have voted the right way that 
night for our democracy, but since that 
time, they haven’t disputed the Big Lie 
enough—some of them, not all of them, 
but some of them. And, of course, now 
they have at least turned a blind eye to 
efforts at the State level that I just 
spoke of. 
I think it is also important for the 
record to note—I won’t read all of 
this—but to note what the Associated 
Press found about the election of 2020. 
Here is a copy. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD this 
Associated Press story titled: ‘‘Far too 
little vote fraud to tip election to 
Trump, AP finds,’’ dated December 14, 
2021, by Christina A. Cassidy. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Associated Press, December 14, 
2021] 
FAR TOO LITTLE VOTE FRAUD TO TIP 
ELECTION TO TRUMP, AP FINDS 
(By Christina A. Cassidy) 
ATLANTA (AP).—An Associated Press re-
view of every potential case of voter fraud in 
the six battleground states disputed by 
former President Donald Trump has found 
fewer than 475—a number that would have 
made no difference in the 2020 presidential 
election. 
Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona, Georgia, 
Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wis-
consin and their 79 Electoral College votes 
by a combined 311,257 votes out of 25.5 mil-
lion ballots cast for president. The disputed 
ballots represent just 0.15% of his victory 
margin in those states. 
The cases could not throw the outcome 
into question even if all the potentially 
fraudulent votes were for Biden, which they 
were not, and even if those ballots were actu-
ally counted, which in most cases they were 
not. 
The review also showed no collusion in-
tended to rig the voting. Virtually every 
case was based on an individual acting alone 
to cast additional ballots. 
The findings build on a mountain of other 
evidence that the election wasn’t rigged, in-
cluding verification of the results by Repub-
lican governors. 
The AP review, a process that took months 
and encompassed more than 300 local elec-
tion offices, is one the most comprehensive 
examinations of suspected voter fraud in last 
year’s presidential election. It relies on in-
formation collected at the local level, where 
officials must reconcile their ballots and ac-
count for discrepancies, and includes a hand-
ful of separate cases cited by secretaries of 
state and state attorneys general. 
Contacted for comment, Trump repeated a 
litany of unfounded claims of fraud he had 
made previously, but offered no new evidence 
that specifically contradicted the AP’s re-
porting. He said a soon-to-come report from 
a source he would not disclose would support 
his case, and insisted increased mail voting 
alone had opened the door to cheating that 
involved ‘‘hundreds of thousands of votes.’’ 
‘‘I just don’t think you should make a fool 
out of yourself by saying 400 votes,’’ he said. 
These are some of the culprits in the ‘‘mas-
sive election fraud’’ Trump falsely says de-
prived him of a second term: 
A Wisconsin man who mistakenly thought 
he could vote while on parole. 
A woman in Arizona suspected of sending 
in a ballot for her dead mother. 
A Pennsylvania man who went twice to the 
polls, voting once on his own behalf and once 
for his son. 
The cases were isolated. There was no 
widespread, coordinated deceit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S256 
January 18, 2022 
The cases also underscore that suspected 
fraud is both generally detected and excep-
tionally rare. ‘‘Voter fraud is virtually non- 
existent,’’ said George Christenson, election 
clerk for Milwaukee County in Wisconsin, 
where five people statewide have been 
charged with fraud out of nearly 3.3 million 
ballots cast for president. ‘‘I would have to 
venture a guess that’s about the same odds 
as getting hit by lightning.’’ 
Even in the state with the highest number 
of potential fraud cases—Arizona, with 198— 
they comprised less than 2% of the margin 
by which Biden won. 
Trump has continued to insist that the 
election was fraudulent by citing a wide 
range of complaints, many of them involving 
the expansion of mail voting because of the 
pandemic. As the Republican weighs another 
run for president in 2024, he has waded into 
some GOP primary contests, bestowing en-
dorsements on those who mimic his ‘‘Stop 
the steal’’ rhetoric and seeking to exact re-
venge on some who have opposed his efforts 
to overturn the results. 
Trump’s false claims of a stolen election 
fueled the deadly Jan. 6 attempted insurrec-
tion at the Capitol, have led to death threats 
against election officials and have become 
deeply ingrained within the GOP, with two- 
thirds of Republicans believing Biden’s elec-
tion is illegitimate. Republican lawmakers 
in several states have used the false claims 
as justification to conduct costly and time- 
consuming partisan election reviews, done at 
Trump’s urging, and add new restrictions for 
voting. 
The number of cases identified so far by 
local elections officials and forwarded to 
prosecutors, local law enforcement or secre-
taries of state for further review undercuts 
Trump’s claim. Election officials also say 
that in most cases, the additional ballots 
were never counted because workers did 
their jobs and pulled them for inspection be-
fore they were added to the tally. 
‘‘There is a very specific reason why we 
don’t see many instances of fraud, and that 
is because the system is designed to catch it, 
to flag it and then hold those people ac-
countable,’’ 
said 
Amber 
McReynolds, 
a 
former director of elections in Denver and 
the founding CEO of the National Vote at 
Home Institute, which promotes mail voting. 
The AP’s review of cases in the six battle-
ground states found no evidence to support 
Trump’s various claims, which have included 
unsupported allegations that more votes 
were tallied than there are registered voters 
and that thousands of mail-in ballots were 
cast by people who are not on voter rolls. 
Dozens of state and federal courts have re-
jected the claims. 
White House spokesman Andrew Bates said 
the AP’s reporting offered further proof that 
the election was fairly conducted and de-
cided, contrary to Trump’s claims. 
‘‘Each time this dangerous but weak and 
fear-ridden conspiracy theory has been put 
forward, it has only cemented the truth 
more by being completely debunked—includ-
ing at the hands of elections authorities 
from both parties across the nation, non-
partisan experts, and over 80 federal judges,’’ 
he said. 
Experts say to pull off stealing a presi-
dential election would require large numbers 
of people willing to risk prosecution, prison 
time and fines working in concert with elec-
tion officials from both parties who are will-
ing to look the other way. And everyone 
somehow would keep quiet about the whole 
affair. 
‘‘It would be the most extensive conspiracy 
in the history of planet Earth,’’ said David 
Becker, a senior trial attorney in the Justice 
Department’s Civil Rights Division during 
the presidencies of Bill Clinton and George 
W. Bush who now directs the nonprofit Cen-
ter for Election Innovation & Research. 
Separate from the fraud allegations are 
claims by Trump and his allies that voting 
systems or ballot tallies were somehow ma-
nipulated to steal the election. Judges across 
the country, of both parties, dismissed those 
claims. That includes a federal judge in 
Michigan who ordered sanctions against at-
torneys allied with Trump for intending to 
create ‘‘confusion, commotion and chaos’’ in 
filing a lawsuit about the vote-counting 
process without checking for evidence to 
support the claims. 
Even Trump’s former attorney general, 
William Barr, said a month after the elec-
tion that there was no indication of wide-
spread fraud that could change the result. 
For its review, AP reporters in five states 
contacted roughly 340 election offices for de-
tails about every instance of potential voter 
fraud that was identified as part of their 
post-election review and certification proc-
ess. 
After an election is over, officials research 
voter records, request and review additional 
information if needed from the state or other 
counties, and eventually decide whether to 
refer potential fraud cases for further inves-
tigation—a process that can take months. 
For Wisconsin, the AP relied on a report 
about fraud investigations compiled by the 
state and filed public records requests to get 
the details of each case, in addition to pros-
ecutions that were not initially reported to 
the state elections commission. Wisconsin is 
the only one of the six states with a central-
ized accounting of all potential voter fraud 
cases. 
A state-by-state accounting: 
—ARIZONA: Authorities have been inves-
tigating 198 possible fraud cases out of near-
ly 3.4 million votes cast, representing 1.9% of 
Biden’s margin of victory in the state. Vir-
tually all the cases were in Pima County, 
home to Tucson, and involved allegations of 
double voting. The county has a practice of 
referring every effort to cast a second ballot 
to prosecutors, something other offices don’t 
do. In the Pima cases, only one ballot for 
each voter was counted. So far, nine people 
have been charged in the state with voting 
fraud crimes following the 2020 election. Six 
of those were filed by the state attorney gen-
eral’s office, which has an election integrity 
unit that is reviewing an undisclosed number 
of additional cases. 
—GEORGIA: Election officials in 124 of the 
state’s 159 counties reported no suspicious 
activity after conducting their post-election 
checks. Officials in 24 counties identified 64 
potential voter fraud cases, representing 
0.54% of Biden’s margin of victory in Geor-
gia. Of those, 31 were determined to be the 
result of an administrative error or some 
other mistake. Eleven counties, most of 
them rural, either declined to say or did not 
respond. The state attorney general’s office 
is reviewing about 20 cases referred so far by 
the state election board related to all elec-
tions in 2020, including the primary, but it 
was not known if any of those overlapped 
with cases already identified by local elec-
tion officials. 
—MICHIGAN: Officials have identified 56 
potential instances of voter fraud in five 
counties, representing 0.04% of Biden’s mar-
gin of victory in the state. Most of the cases 
involved two people suspected of submitting 
about 50 fraudulent requests for absentee 
ballots in Macomb, Wayne and Oakland 
counties. All the suspicious applications 
were flagged by election officials and no bal-
lots were cast improperly. 
—NEVADA: Local officials identified be-
tween 93 and 98 potential fraud cases out of 
1.4 million ballots cast, representing less 
than one-third of 1% of Biden’s margin of 
victory. More than half the total—58—were 
in Washoe County, which includes Reno, and 
the vast majority involved allegations of 
possible double voting. The statewide total 
does not include thousands of fraud allega-
tions submitted to the state by local Repub-
licans. Republican Secretary of State Bar-
bara Cegavske has said many of those were 
based ‘‘largely upon an incomplete assess-
ment of voter registration records and lack 
of information concerning the processes by 
which these records are compiled and main-
tained.’’ It’s not known how many remain 
under investigation. 
—PENNSYLVANIA: Election officials in 11 
of the state’s 67 counties identified 26 pos-
sible cases of voter fraud, representing 0.03% 
of Biden’s margin of victory. The elections 
office in Philadelphia refused to discuss po-
tential cases with the AP, but the prosecu-
tor’s office in Philadelphia said it has not re-
ceived any fraud-related referrals. 
—WISCONSIN: Election officials have re-
ferred 31 cases of potential fraud to prosecu-
tors in 12 of the state’s 72 counties, rep-
resenting about 0.15% of Biden’s margin of 
victory. After reviewing them, prosecutors 
declined to bring charges in 26 of those cases. 
Meagan Wolfe, administrator of the Wis-
consin Elections Commission, said the num-
ber of cases in 2020 was ‘‘fairly run of the 
mill.’’ 
AP’s review found the potential cases of 
fraud ran the gamut: Some were attributed 
to administrative error or voter confusion 
while others were being examined as inten-
tional attempts to commit fraud. In those 
cases, many involved people who sought to 
vote twice—by casting both an absentee and 
an in-person ballots—or those who cast a 
ballot for a dead relative such as the woman 
in Maricopa County, Arizona. Authorities 
there say she signed her mother’s name on a 
ballot envelope. The woman’s mother had 
died a month before the election. 
The cases are bipartisan. Some of those 
charged with fraud are registered Repub-
licans or told investigators they were sup-
porters of Trump. 
Donald Holz is among the five people in 
Wisconsin who face voter fraud charges. He 
said all he wanted to do was vote for Trump. 
But because he was still on parole after 
being convicted of felony drunken driving, 
the 63-year-old retiree was not eligible to do 
so. Wisconsin is not among the states that 
have loosened felon voting laws in recent 
years. 
Holz said he had no intention to break the 
law and only did so after he asked poll work-
ers if it was OK. 
‘‘The only thing that helps me out is that 
I know what I did and I did it with good in-
tentions,’’ Holz said after an initial court ap-
pearance in Fond du Lac. ‘‘The guy upstairs 
knows what I did. I didn’t have any intention 
to commit election fraud.’’ 
In 
southeast 
Pennsylvania, 
72-year-old 
Ralph Thurman, a registered Republican, 
was sentenced to three years’ probation after 
pleading guilty to one count of repeat vot-
ing. Authorities said Thurman, after voting 
at his polling place, returned about an hour 
later wearing sunglasses and cast a ballot in 
his son’s name. 
After being recognized and confronted, 
Thurman fled the building, officials said. 
Thurman’s attorney told the AP the incident 
was the result of miscommunication at the 
polling place. Las Vegas businessman Donald 
‘‘Kirk’’ Hartle was among those in Nevada 
who raised the cry against election fraud. 
Early on, Hartle insisted someone had un-
lawfully cast a ballot in the name of his dead 
wife, and state Republicans seized on his 
story to support their claims of widespread 
fraud in the state. It turned out that some-
one had cast the ballot illegally—Hartle,

himself. He agreed to plead guilty to a re-
duced charge of voting more than once in the 
same election. Hartle’s attorney said the 
businessman, who is an executive at a com-
pany that hosted a Trump rally before the 
election, had accepted responsibility for his 
actions. 
Additional fraud cases could still surface 
in the weeks and months ahead. One avenue 
for those is the Electronic Registration In-
formation 
Center, 
a 
data-sharing 
effort 
among 31 states aimed at improving state 
voter rolls. The effort also provides states 
with reports after each general election with 
information about voters who might have 
cast ballots in more than one state. 
In the past, those lists have generated 
small numbers of fraud cases. In 2018, for ex-
ample, Wisconsin used the report to identify 
43 additional instances of potential fraud out 
of 2.6 million ballots cast. 
Official post-election audits and other re-
search have shown voter fraud to be excep-
tionally rare. A nonpartisan audit of Wiscon-
sin’s 2020 presidential election found no evi-
dence of widespread fraud and a Republican 
lawmaker concluded it showed that elections 
in the state were ‘‘safe and secure,’’ while 
also recommending dozens of changes to how 
elections are run. In Michigan, Republican 
state senators issued a report earlier this 
year saying they had found ‘‘no evidence of 
widespread or systematic fraud’’ in the 2020 
election. 
Not only do election officials look for 
fraud, they have procedures to detect and 
prevent it. For mail voting, which expanded 
greatly last year because of the pandemic, 
election officials log every mail ballot so 
voters cannot request more than one. Those 
ballots also are logged when they are re-
turned, checked against registration and, in 
many cases, voter signatures on file to en-
sure the voter assigned to the ballot is the 
one who cast it. If everything doesn’t match, 
the ballot isn’t counted. 
‘‘Often, we don’t get to fraud,’’ said Jen-
nifer Morrell, a former local election official 
in Utah and Colorado who advises election 
officials on security and other issues. ‘‘Say 
we have evidence that something might not 
be correct, we ask the voter to provide addi-
tional documentation. If the person doesn’t 
respond, the ballot isn’t accepted. The fraud 
never happened.’’ 
If a person who requested a mail ballot 
shows up at a polling place, this will become 
apparent when they check in. Typically, poll 
workers either cancel the ballot that was 
previously issued, ensuring it’s never count-
ed, or ask the voter to complete a provi-
sional ballot that will only be counted if the 
mail ballot is not. 
In Union County, Georgia, someone voted 
in person and then election officials found 
their ballot in a drop box. Since the person 
had already voted, the ballot in the drop box 
was not counted and the case was referred to 
the state for investigation, Deputy Registrar 
Diana Nichols said. 
‘‘We can tell pretty quick whenever we pull 
up that record—wait a minute, this person 
has already voted,’’ Nichols said. ‘‘I’m not 
saying it’s foolproof. We are all human, and 
we all make mistakes. But as far as the sys-
tem is set up, if you follow the rules and the 
guidelines set up by the state, I think it’s a 
very good system.’’ 
The final step is the canvassing process in 
which election officials must reconcile all 
their counts ensuring the number of ballots 
cast equals the number of voters who voted. 
Any discrepancies are researched, and elec-
tion officials provide detailed explanations 
before the election can be certified. 
Often, an administrative error can raise 
questions that suggest the potential for 
fraud. In Forsyth County, Georgia, election 
officials were asked by Arizona investigators 
for records confirming that a voter had also 
cast a ballot in Georgia last November. It 
turns out that voter didn’t cast a ballot but 
was listed as having done so because their 
registration number was mistakenly associ-
ated with another voter’s record in the coun-
ty’s system, according to a letter sent by 
county election officials. 
In other cases, it could be as simple as a 
voter signing on the wrong line next to an-
other person name in a paper pollbook at 
their polling place. Once researched, it 
quickly becomes clear no fraud occurred. 
Republican lawmakers have argued there 
are security gaps in the process, using con-
cerns of fraud to justify restrictions on vot-
ing laws. This has happened even in places 
where Republican lawmakers have pushed 
back against Trump’s false claims and said 
the 2020 election was valid. 
The review by Republican lawmakers in 
Michigan that found no systemic fraud cited 
various claims they had investigated. For ex-
ample, senators were provided with a list of 
over 200 voters in Wayne County who were 
believed to be dead. Of these, the report 
noted, only two instances involved actual 
dead voters. The first was due to a clerical 
error in which a son had been confused with 
his dead father and the second involved a 92- 
year-old woman who had died four days be-
fore the election. 
And yet, Republicans in the state are col-
lecting signatures for a citizen initiative 
that would allow the GOP-controlled legisla-
ture to approve voting restrictions and by-
pass a veto by the Democratic governor. Re-
publicans say mail voting needs to be more 
secure as more people embrace it. 
‘‘These bills will restore confidence in our 
elections,’’ said GOP Rep. Ann Bollin, chair-
woman of the Michigan House Elections and 
Ethics Committee and a former township 
clerk. ‘‘Voters want to know their vote will 
count and that they, and only they, are cast-
ing their own ballot.’’ 
Overall, 80% of counties in the six states 
reviewed by the AP reported no suspicious 
activity after completing their post-election 
reviews. This was true of both small and 
large counties, something experts said was 
to be expected given how rare voter fraud 
has been. 
Limited instances of fraud do occur, as the 
AP review illustrates, but safeguards ensure 
they are few and that they are caught, said 
Ben Hovland, a Democrat appointed by 
Trump to serve on the U.S. Election Assist-
ance Commission, which supports the state 
and local officials who administer elections. 
‘‘Every credible examination has shown 
there was no widespread fraud’’ in the 2020 
presidential election, Hovland said. ‘‘Time 
and again when we have heard these claims 
and heard these allegations, and when you do 
a real investigation, you see that it is the ex-
ception and not the rule.’’ 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I will just 
read the first paragraph of this Associ-
ated Press story dated December of 
this past year: 
An Associated Press review of every poten-
tial case of voter fraud in the six battle-
ground states disputed by former President 
Donald Trump has found fewer than 475—a 
number that would have made no difference 
in the 2020 Presidential election. 
And, of course, Pennsylvania was one 
of those States that they looked at. We 
know what happened in the election, 
and we know why we can say with cer-
tainty that the Big Lie is nothing but 
a lie. After the election of 2020, in June 
of 2021, Pennsylvania’s Republican-con-
trolled legislature became one of the 
many legislatures across the Nation 
passing a voter suppression law. Here is 
what they would have done if they 
were successful. If they would have 
passed it, this bill would have imposed 
unconstitutional voter ID restrictions, 
restricted mail-in voting—the mail-in 
voting they just voted in favor of in 
2019, the same legislators—and this bill 
would essentially have eliminated the 
use of drop boxes. Furthermore, it 
rolled back several successful provi-
sions of the bipartisan Act 77, includ-
ing reducing the number of days per-
mitted to register to vote, and elimi-
nating an option to opt in to receive an 
annual mail-in ballot. 
While this bill was, fortunately, ve-
toed by Governor Wolf, the threat to 
suppress the vote in Pennsylvania re-
mains ever present as the legislature 
continues to work on another omnibus 
election bill. 
Once again, the Big Lie animates the 
work 
of 
Republican 
politicians 
in 
Pennsylvania 
and 
throughout 
the 
country. It is not simply a lie; it is a 
lie that engenders fear. Sometimes fear 
of losing your election in a primary— 
we understand that fear. We have seen 
it play out here as well. But sometimes 
the fear is deeper than that; that your 
own security will be at risk if you 
don’t espouse the Big Lie. 
In light of these efforts, it is fair to 
question, How did Pennsylvania go 
from a shining example of bipartisan 
election reform in 2019 to ground zero 
in the fight against voter suppression 
and election misinformation in 2021 
and continuing into 2022? 
In the months leading up to the 2020 
general election, the former President 
led an assault on our election system, 
sowing seeds of division, and, without 
evidence, questioning the legitimacy of 
voting methods, including mail-in vot-
ing, which has been utilized in the Na-
tion for decades. By the way, mail-in 
voting allowed us to set a turnout 
record, as I said before, in Pennsyl-
vania, for the first time in 60 years to 
go that high—of the voting-age popu-
lation. 
The former President lost his elec-
tion to President Joe Biden, but in-
stead of honorably conceding the race, 
he created the Big Lie that the election 
had been stolen from him by raising 
unfounded allegations of voter fraud, 
election irregularities in Pennsylvania 
and across the Nation. Of course, there 
is simply no evidence to justify these 
claims of widespread voter fraud or 
irregularities, as suggested in the AP 
story and in their investigation that 
undergirds their conclusions that sup-
port that. 
The Big Lie is the fraud. If you want 
to talk about fraud, that is where it is. 
That is the fraud. The Big Lie is the 
falsehood and the con job. It is a delib-
erate, ongoing attempt to sow insta-
bility. We know that over 60 cases in 
court after court—from State courts to 
district courts, to circuit courts, to the 
U.S. Supreme Court—all those courts 
refused to indulge the unprecedented,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S258 
January 18, 2022 
loopy, legal arguments and false con-
spiracy theories that were put forward 
by the President’s campaign and some 
Republicans after the election. 
Despite the lack of any evidence to 
support claims of widespread fraud, we 
continue to hear these baseless con-
spiracy theories in calls to roll back 
Pennsylvania’s Act 77 for one reason 
and one reason only: to disenfranchise 
voters. So in order to please one man, 
rather than support positive reforms 
that worked in Pennsylvania, that in-
creased turnout in Pennsylvania expo-
nentially like no other law has, law-
makers have introduced, all over the 
country now, some 400 voter suppres-
sion bills. 
There are three types of corrupt pro-
posals that I would like to summarize. 
No. 1, shifting election authority; that 
is one measure of a corrupt practice. 
No. 2, attacking election workers; that 
is corrupt, and that is what they are 
trying to do. And No. 3, restricting 
mail-in voting. 
First and foremost, many of the bills 
attack 
the 
most 
fundamental 
foundational element of our democ-
racy: administering our elections. 
According to a report from Voting 
Rights Lab, in September of 2021, more 
than 180 of the bills introduced across 
the country are an effort to subvert our 
current election administration. Some 
of these bills would allow the legisla-
ture or other partisan actors—really, 
purveyors of the Big Lie—to exert 
greater control over elections and 
interfere with local election adminis-
trators. 
For example, Georgia’s SB 202, which 
has already been enacted into law—not 
just proposed—this law will allow a 
partisan State election board to re-
move and replace local election admin-
istrators. The new law empowers the 
State legislature—the State legisla-
ture—to appoint the chair of the elec-
tion board, ensuring that the majority 
of the board reflects the partisan will 
of the legislature. 
We have also seen numerous law-
makers, including in Pennsylvania, ini-
tiate or attempt to initiate partisan 
election ‘‘audits’’ into the 2020 election 
results without any evidence of fraud. 
The better word for this type of ap-
proach is ‘‘fraudit.’’ That is what it is. 
It is a fraudulent attempt, and it is 
nothing more than a ‘‘fraudit.’’ 
These efforts fueled by the Big Lie 
have wasted millions of taxpayer dol-
lars, money solely in an attempt to 
further call into doubt the 2020 election 
and create instability in our elections. 
Republican effort to shift election au-
thority undermines people’s faith in 
elections, and it injects partisanship 
into our election administration. 
The second area of corruption we 
have also seen in some of these bills is 
efforts to pass legislation that create 
or increase civil and criminal penalties 
against election workers. Election offi-
cials across the Nation—Republicans 
and Democrats alike, from blue coun-
ties and red counties—should be ac-
corded the respect and commendation 
they deserve. These are public serv-
ants. They should not be subjected to 
threats, either legal or otherwise. In 
the middle of the pandemic, these same 
Americans risked their own health and 
their families’ health to ensure that 
the elections were conducted safely and 
efficiently. These Americans—Repub-
licans and Democrats and Independ-
ents—did their job honorably. Rather 
than receiving appreciation for their 
efforts, they and their families have 
been threatened with threats of vio-
lence, fueled by the deliberate false-
hoods of which I spoke before. 
The same falsehoods spread by politi-
cians here in Washington and in State 
legislatures across the country. These 
threats were particularly relevant in 
my home State of Pennsylvania when 
then-Philadelphia 
Commissioner, 
Al 
Schmidt, a Republican, his family, and 
his colleagues were subjected to death 
threats—death threats—for doing their 
job. 
This is a Republican elected official 
in Philadelphia subjected to death 
threats after election day, simply be-
cause he was trying to fulfill—and the 
others who worked with him were try-
ing to fulfill—an essential part of their 
basic duty, which is counting the votes 
in that city. 
So 
despite 
the 
widely 
reported 
threats against our election officials 
and concerns about mass resignations 
due to the stresses on our democratic 
institutions, Republican legislatures 
have enacted laws that further threat-
en these officials with felony prosecu-
tions, and they also threaten civil pen-
alties for not complying with the elec-
tion rules, even inadvertent or tech-
nical mistakes. 
We have never seen this before in 
America, but that is what we are talk-
ing about today. So these attacks are a 
clear attempt to further undermine our 
democracy and counter the efforts of 
many election officials to help make 
voting safer and easier during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Finally, the third issue, which I 
would consider a corrupt practice that 
is embedded into these bills, is the 
question of mail-in voting. As I have 
already shared, Pennsylvania’s record 
turnout in 2020 was a direct result of 
the bipartisan efforts, 133 Republican 
legislators voting for mail-in balloting, 
so that we would have universal mail- 
in voting, and early voting in addition 
to mail-in voting. 
Rather than embracing its success, 
Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania 
and across the country have worked to 
greatly restrict or eliminate—or elimi-
nate—mail-in voting through a variety 
of methods. Seven States have reduced 
the timeframe in which voters can re-
quest mail-in ballots. Another four 
States limited the use of ballot drop 
boxes. 
Some States have gutted or tried to 
gut the ability of voters to automati-
cally register to receive a mail-in bal-
lot for every election they are eligible 
to vote in. 
Republican politicians just keep on 
lying about the 2020 election. Not a sin-
gle Republican politician has come for-
ward with evidence of the type of wide-
spread systemic voter fraud that would 
necessitate any of the changes that 
these laws are predicated on and these 
proposals are predicated on. 
In reality, these changes are about 
one thing and one thing only—making 
it more difficult to cast a ballot. 
Every single American should be 
alarmed by these efforts. If we allow 
voter suppression efforts to go un-
checked, they will, eventually and sim-
ply, impact everyone. 
I think it was Martin Luther King 
who talked about injustice—an injus-
tice that would be validated by these 
corrupt proposals. ‘‘Injustice anywhere 
is a threat to justice everywhere.’’ 
Voter suppression efforts would make 
it harder. Here are just a couple of ex-
amples from my home State, and this 
is true of a lot of States. Voter sup-
pression laws make it harder for a 90- 
year-old living in rural Pennsylvania 
who can’t get to her county election 
bureau to vote or to a polling place. 
She will have a harder time voting in 
Pennsylvania and in every other State, 
if Pennsylvania goes in the direction of 
some of these other States. 
Pennsylvania has over 800,000 vet-
erans who fought for our freedoms, in-
cluding the right to vote, the freedom 
to vote. Shouldn’t that veteran con-
tinue to have the option to vote early 
or to vote by mail? After they have 
served our Nation, shouldn’t they con-
tinue to have that option? Or should we 
just go back to the old ways where that 
veteran is limited to one day a year, 
for a certain number of hours a year, to 
vote in a general election? 
So these proposals—these voter sup-
pression and subversion proposals—will 
impact everyone. It will impact a farm-
er in Pennsylvania who might have a 
very busy day on election day and 
can’t get to vote for one reason or an-
other. 
So, if they are not able to vote, their 
vote gets cancelled out because we de-
cided not to have early voting, which 
we have now; we decided not to have 
mail-in ballots, which we have now? 
All in the service of one man and one 
Big Lie, that is what this is all about. 
So we can’t go back to those days. 
How about just another example 
from Pennsylvania? We have had a long 
tradition where men and women serv-
ing overseas have voted by absentee 
ballot. Guess what an absentee ballot 
is? An absentee ballot is a mail-in bal-
lot. It is the same thing. We just broad-
ened the category of folks who could 
use that same method. 
So do we want to go back to a time 
when we can’t have the kind of mail-in 
ballots that we had in 2020 that led to 
that great turnout? And it is entirely 
possible that we could go back to a 
time when even the votes of men and 
women serving overseas would be put 
at risk, because when you eliminate

January 18, 2022 
mail-in ballots in a State like Pennsyl-
vania, you are eliminating absentee 
ballots, as well, by doing that. 
So I don’t think we want to do that 
to our fighting men and women. So we 
can’t go back to the days when farmers 
and small business owners and veterans 
and busy moms juggling their kids’ 
schedules and seniors who may have 
trouble voting and need another option 
to vote—we can’t go back to those days 
when they couldn’t vote if they didn’t 
have the time on that one single day. 
It is one of the reasons why we had 
such low voter turnout, even in Presi-
dential elections, for all these years in 
Pennsylvania and in so many other 
States. So we know what we have to 
do. We have to go back to our founding 
principles. And voting is a foundational 
pillar of our democracy. And, as elect-
ed officials, it is our responsibility to 
do all we can to expand voter access 
and remove institutional barriers to 
voting. 
But we have got to be clearer about 
what is happening. Our democracy, by 
virtue of these suppression bills, is 
under siege right now. The attack here 
on January 6 continues. What was a 
violent attack on that day is now in 
the form of legislation to attack our 
elections, to attack the right to vote, 
to make it harder to vote. 
So attacking democracy at an earlier 
stage was always met by the right re-
sponse. Today, that right response—the 
correct response—is to pass the Free-
dom to Vote and the John Lewis Act to 
prevent these kinds of attacks on vot-
ing rights. 
It would protect election officials by 
criminalizing intimidation, threats, or 
coercion of election officials. It would 
mandate systematic, nonpartisan, risk- 
limiting audits to combat against the 
unfounded partisan approaches by Re-
publicans. 
It would create national standards 
for early voting, mail voting, voting 
restoration, voter identification, and 
voter registration. It would also in-
clude some of the provisions of my 
bill—the Accessible Voting Act—to cre-
ate an accessible voting experience for 
every voter, ensuring that the needs of 
people with disabilities are met. 
That is another category of Ameri-
cans whose votes will be suppressed— 
people with disabilities—if these Re-
publicans get their way. 
This bill we are trying to pass re-
flects feedback from State and local of-
ficials to ensure that people respon-
sible for implementing these reforms 
can do so effectively. 
And, furthermore, it would restore 
the full strength of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1965 after the Supreme Court 
gutted several of the Voting Rights Act 
provisions in recent years. 
These provisions work hand in hand 
to improve access to the ballot and 
protect against election subversion. We 
should restore the Senate at the same 
time, by allowing plenty of time for de-
bate, as well as a robust amendment 
process, so the minority party in the 
Senate has full opportunity to debate 
issues like voting rights. 
So we have got to do more than just 
simply move a bill forward tomorrow 
on voting rights. We should also 
change the Senate rules appropriately 
to allow that bill to be passed by a ma-
jority after we have a robust debate. 
Debating voting rights has never been 
more important. The time to do that is 
now. 
I yield the floor.

SAN). The Senator from Utah.

H.R. 5746 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
have enjoyed the discussion which has 
been going on with regard to this legis-
lation and have a couple of comments. 
One is, given the interest and the pri-
ority of and the importance of elec-
tions, it would have been helpful, prior 
to preparing this legislation for a vote, 
if those that were the drafters of this 
legislation actually invited a Repub-
lican—any Republican—to sit down and 
perhaps negotiate and see if we could 
find some common ground. 
But instead, the Democrat leadership 
dusted off what they had written before 
on an entirely partisan basis and then 
are 
shocked—shocked—that 
Repub-
licans don’t want to support what they 
drafted. 
Now, I note that political overstate-
ment and hyperbole may be relatively 
common, and they are often excused. 
But the President and some of my 
Democratic colleagues have ventured 
deep into hysteria. Their cataclysmic 
predictions for failing to support their 
entirely 
partisan 
election 
reform— 
worked out entirely by themselves, 
without any input whatsoever from 
any single person on my side of the 
aisle—they are far beyond the pale. 
Now, they are entirely right to call 
out Donald Trump’s Big Lie about the 
last election being stolen. But in the 
same spirit of honesty, they should not 
engage in a similar lie that Repub-
licans across the country are making it 
much harder for minorities to vote 
and, thus, that the Federal government 
must urgently displace centuries of 
constitutional 
practice 
that 
give 
States primary control over elections. 
So dire are the consequences, they 
claim, that this must be done by shred-
ding the rules of our senior legislative 
body. They point to Georgia as evi-
dence of political election villainy. The 
President went there to deliver his 
crowning argument. But, as has been 
pointed out by many before me, it is 
easier for minorities—and everybody 
else for that matter—to vote in Geor-
gia than it is in the President’s home 
State of Delaware and in Leader SCHU-
MER’s home State of New York. 
In Georgia there are more days of 
early voting, and in Georgia there is 
no-excuse absentee voting by mail. 
They do decry Georgia’s prohibition 
of political activists approaching vot-
ers in line with drinks of water, but the 
same prohibition exists in New York. 
And why? So that voters don’t get har-
assed in line by poll activists. 
Just like Georgia and New York, 
many States keep poll activists at 
length from voters. My Democrat col-
leagues conveniently ignore the fact 
that the 1965 Voting Rights Act prohi-
bition of any voting practice or proce-
dure that discriminates against mi-
norities is still in effect. Even today, 
the Justice Department is suing two 
States under that law. 
Protection of minority voting is al-
ready required by law. Protection of 
minority voting is a high and essential 
priority for me and for my Senate col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. 
To be clear, I want an election sys-
tem that allows every eligible citizen 
in every State to be able to exercise 
their right to vote in every single elec-
tion. 
So, putting aside the hysteria, let me 
explain why I don’t support the Demo-
crats’ bill. First, their bill weakens 
voter ID. I, along with a great majority 
of voters of all races, favor voter photo 
ID. Their bill makes it easier to cheat 
by accommodating unmonitored vote 
collection boxes. Their bill opens the 
gates to a flood of lawsuits pre- and 
post-election, and it weakens the safe-
guards of voter registration. 
There are other things in the Demo-
crats’ bill that I don’t support. I am 
not in favor of Federal funding for 
campaigns. I also don’t think States 
should be required to allow felons to 
vote. 
Most fundamentally, I think by re-
serving election procedures to the 
States, the Founders made it more dif-
ficult for a would-be authoritarian to 
change the law for voting in just one 
place—here in Washington—to keep 
himself in office. 
Let me add that I think the Demo-
crats’ bill is insufficiently focused on 
the real threat, and that is the corrup-
tion of the counting of the ballots, the 
certification of elections, and the con-
gressional provisions for accepting and 
counting a slate of electors. This is 
where the apparent conspirators were 
focused in their attempt in the last 
election to subvert democracy and pre-
vent the peaceful transfer of power. 
Now, I respect Democrats who dis-
agree with my point of view. I hope 
they will offer me the same respect. 
People who want voter ID are not rac-
ists. People who don’t want Federal 
funding of campaigns aren’t Bull Con-
nor. People who insist that vote drop 
boxes be monitored aren’t Jefferson 
Davis.

Mr. PADILLA. Madam President,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S260 
January 18, 2022 
King deeply felt the lasting wounds of 
slavery and segregation. Yet he be-
lieved in the promise of America’s 
highest ideal: a system of democracy 
that we are all created equal; democ-
racy that recognizes that we are all 
created equal. 
In 1957, Dr. King told a crowd of civil 
rights leaders: 
Our most urgent plea to the federal gov-
ernment is to guarantee our voting rights. 
He went on to say: 
Give us the ballot and we will creatively 
join in the freeing of the soul of America. 
Time and again, from a bridge in 
Selma to the steps of the Lincoln Me-
morial, Dr. King and the civil rights 
movement 
collectively 
forced 
this 
country to confront the brutal injus-
tice of White supremacy. 
Dr. King kindled a movement of 
peaceful protests, of voter registration, 
and a legal revolution. His leadership 
helped secure the passage of the Voting 
Rights Act in 1965—a monument to 
freedom and a guardian of our multira-
cial democracy. 
As important a step as that was, Dr. 
King also understood that the path of 
progress, the road to freedom, would 
not be linear, it would not be direct, 
and it would be threatened by set-
backs. Recent years have illustrated 
just how right Dr. King was. The clock 
is turning back on voting rights, and 
far too many people both inside this 
Capitol and outside it are ignoring or 
denying the alarm bells. 
To truly honor Dr. King, we must re-
dedicate ourselves to the cause of free-
dom and equality. We cannot wait for a 
convenient season to act. We cannot 
wait for another Bloody Sunday. Look 
around. This is our moment. The 
threats to democracy today may look 
different than Bull Connor with the 
bullhorn, but they are no less real. 
Now, when Republicans claim that 
this is all hyperbole or hysteria, as 
Senator ROMNEY just referenced, con-
sider this: In the year since our Na-
tion’s most secure election ever, with 
record voter turnout, Republican State 
legislatures have passed 34 laws, not 
expanding access to the ballot, re-
stricting access to the ballot and also 
threatening election security. 
Just look at Georgia—yes, Georgia— 
where Republicans passed an elections 
bill, SB 202, on a purely partisan basis 
this last spring. In the 2020 election, 
Georgians voted in record numbers. 
Many voted by mail or used early vot-
ing options to be able to cast their bal-
lots safely and securely in the midst of 
this once-in-a-century global health 
pandemic. Guess what happened. Those 
ballots were processed, counted, au-
dited, and the results certified. 
So how did Georgia Republicans re-
spond? They wrote SB 202 to cut the 
number of early voting drop boxes in 
Atlanta by more than 75 percent to 
make it harder—not easier but hard-
er—for voters who mistakenly go to 
the wrong polling place to cast their 
ballots and have their votes in state-
wide contests counted; to stop new vot-
ers from being able to register to vote 
in a runoff election if there is one. 
Now, make no mistake, Republicans 
will deny the intention, but the effect 
is clear: These changes disproportion-
ately disenfranchise the votes and the 
voices of people of color. 
When voters end up standing in line 
for hours to cast their vote on election 
day, as voters of color disproportion-
ately do, SB 202 prevents volunteers 
from offering them food or water. 
Now, Senator ROMNEY said that these 
provisions are in place to prevent the 
harassment of voters waiting to vote. 
Look at what other States have done. 
There is a clear distinction between 
somebody harassing a voter, inter-
fering 
with 
the 
electoral 
process, 
versus offering a thirsty neighbor a 
drink. So outlaw harassment. I think it 
kind of is. The general public knows 
the distinction. So think about that— 
someone standing in line outdoors, 
with weather, for hours to do their pa-
triotic duty, and Georgia Republicans 
make it a crime to give that person a 
bottle of water. 
SB 202 isn’t about election security 
or voter fraud. The data on that is 
clear. Voter fraud is exceedingly rare 
in Georgia and across the country. SB 
202 is about erecting barriers for low- 
income voters, for voters of color, for 
younger voters to participate in our de-
mocracy. 
As a member of the Senate Rules 
Committee, I traveled to Georgia last 
summer with my colleagues for a field 
hearing on voter suppression. Just last 
week, I was invited to join President 
Biden and Vice President HARRIS in 
Georgia as well. So when Minority 
Leader MCCONNELL tries to tell you 
that no State in America is making it 
harder to vote, he is wrong. The people 
of this country deserve to hear the 
truth, and not just from Georgia but in 
Texas, where a new law empowers par-
tisan poll watchers to threaten elec-
tion officials with lawsuits; in Arizona, 
where a new law will unnecessarily cut 
tens of thousands of voters—eligible 
voters—from the permanent early vot-
ing list. 
Thirty-four new laws in this past 
year alone will raise obstacles for peo-
ple who simply want to cast their bal-
lot, and that is nothing to say of the 
hundreds more that have been proposed 
that will surely be reintroduced in fu-
ture years and future sessions if we do 
not act. 
The clock on Dr. King’s victory is al-
ready turning back. The alarm bells of 
our democracy are ringing. They have 
been ringing since the year 2013, when 
the Supreme Court gutted the Voting 
Rights Act. Yes, it may still be in 
place, but the preclearance require-
ment—the strongest protection within 
the Voting Rights Act that stood to 
prevent discriminatory election laws 
for nearly five decades—was undone by 
the Supreme Court in their decision in 
Shelby v. Holder. Yet the Senate has 
failed three times this last year to even 
debate a voting rights bill. We failed to 
debate because of the filibuster rule, 
which allows a minority of Senators to 
obstruct the voice of the American ma-
jority. 
Republican Senators claim that our 
legislation, the Freedom to Vote Act, 
is partisan and divisive, but what goal 
could be more American than securing 
the fundamental right to vote for all 
eligible Americans? 
If Republican Senators are sincere 
about opposing partisan changes to 
election laws, then they should join us 
in condemning partisan voter suppres-
sion in Georgia, in Texas, in Arizona, 
and across the country. Instead, Senate 
Republicans only complain about and 
obstruct our efforts here in the Senate 
to respond to these laws, and in doing 
so, they leave Democrats no choice. We 
must change the filibuster rule to pro-
tect voting rights for every American. 
The Senate exists to serve American 
democracy, and the Senate rules exist 
to help the Senate serve American de-
mocracy. When those rules endanger 
our democracy, the answer is simple: 
We must change them. 
It is not unprecedented. The Senate 
changed the filibuster in 1917 to protect 
our Nation from the threat of World 
War I. The Senate changed the fili-
buster in 1975 to try to restore the 
function of this body. In recent dec-
ades, the Senate has made more than 
160 exceptions to the filibuster to do 
what is best for the Nation. Today, it is 
time for us to do so once again. 
With all due respect to the history 
and the traditions of the Senate, our 
job is to protect the future of this 
country, beginning with our democ-
racy. As Martin Luther King once told 
us, ‘‘America is essentially a dream, a 
dream . . . yet unfulfilled.’’ 
Today, it falls on each of us to take 
up Dr. King’s lifelong struggle. This is 
our moment. This is our moment to de-
bate. This is our moment to vote. We 
must work together to pass a voting 
rights law that secures the vote for 
every American regardless of race, reli-
gion, ability, or gender. 
Sometimes progress requires that we 
change the rules, as we did last month 
when we changed the filibuster to pro-
tect our economy. Sometimes progress 
requires that one party act alone, as 
the courageous architects of the 15th 
Amendment did a century and a half 
ago. 
Look around this Senate, and think 
how surprised the men who created the 
filibuster in the early 1800s would be to 
see a Senator WARNOCK, a Senator 
BALDWIN, myself, and others serving in 
this Chamber today, but change that 
strengthens our democracy is change 
for the better. 
Colleagues, we must rise to meet this 
general moment of challenge in the 
spirit of Dr. King and pass these voting 
rights bills. 
I yield the floor.

S261 
January 18, 2022 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, one of 
the things that I sometimes regret 
about this body—and especially after 
hearing such an eloquent presentation 
from my colleague from California—is 
that we don’t do enough dialogue here; 
it is a lot of monologues. Often, some 
of the best speeches that I have heard 
in this Chamber have been delivered to 
nearly empty Chambers because we 
don’t sit and listen to one another, an-
swer questions, engage, find the great-
er wisdom. 
I am excited that tomorrow will give 
us an opportunity to do that. I expect 
50—hopefully, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100—Sen-
ators on the floor for a discussion 
about voting rights, which we have not 
been able to have since I joined the 
Senate in January of 2013. This is an 
enormously important topic. We have 
not had a floor debate on any voting 
rights bill since I came to the Senate 
in 2013. 
In this spirit of dialogue, I wanted to 
basically come and talk about Senate 
rules to respond to a question or a 
challenge that Republicans were mak-
ing on the floor last week. They point-
ed out that I, along with a number of 
Democrats, had signed a letter in 2017, 
arguing, in their view, that we should 
not change the filibuster on legisla-
tion. They cited that, and they said: 
How can you stand on the floor now 
and contemplate changes to the fili-
buster rule? 
So what I wanted to do tonight is 
come to the floor and talk about 2017, 
talk about things that have happened 
since 2017, and, frankly, explain why I 
haven’t really changed the position 
that I articulated in the letter, but I 
have changed my views about whether 
the filibuster accomplishes the objec-
tive or cuts against it. 
Finally, what I want to do at the end 
of that, of answering their question 
about that letter, is to reassure them— 
to reassure them that what we will 
reach for tomorrow is not a blowing up 
of the filibuster. 
I heard my colleague from Alaska 
today say we wanted to blow up the fil-
ibuster. No. Let me reassure all Repub-
licans that that is not what they are 
going to be asked to vote on tomorrow. 
They are going to be asked to restore 
the filibuster to what it was during the 
vast majority of the history of this 
body. 
Here is the operant quote from the 
letter of 2017 that I signed. It was in 
April of 2017, shortly after the Repub-
licans had changed the Senate rules to 
ram through Neil Gorsuch after they 
had refused to even entertain the nomi-
nation of Merrick Garland to the Su-
preme Court. It was a bipartisan letter. 
‘‘We are united in our determination to 
preserve the ability of Members to en-
gage in extended debate when bills are 
on the Senate floor’’—‘‘extended debate 
when bills are on the Senate floor.’’ 
Well, what has happened since that 
letter was written in April of 2017? 
First, those of us in the room know, 
as for extended debate on the Senate 
floor, are you kidding? It almost never 
happens. The filibuster rule that some 
of us hoped might facilitate that has 
become an obstacle to it. In fact, you 
can’t even get a bill on the Senate floor 
because the filibuster requirement, 
which was initially something about 
final passage, has been now imported 
even into proceeding to legislation. So 
when a majority of Members of the 
greatest deliberative body in the world 
decide they want to talk about a topic, 
they can’t. It is like the 21st century’s 
version of the gag rule, which prohib-
ited discussions in Congress on items 
related to slavery during the 1830s and 
1840s. There has been a gag rule prohib-
iting discussions of the voting rights 
bill and other civil rights legislation 
and other important priorities because 
you can’t even get on the bill, much 
less have extended debate about it. 
When you do get on the bill, how 
many bills around here do we have ex-
tended debate on? Mostly, we are in a 
Chamber like this, with three people, 
and there is no real debate that is 
going on because the abuse of the fili-
buster leads a party to say: Well, gosh, 
if they can’t get 60 votes for some-
thing, we don’t even have to show up. 
The old public filibuster of ‘‘Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington’’ days has now 
turned to a secret, private filibuster 
where people can stay in their offices 
and never show their faces on the floor. 
So that notion of naive Senators like 
me in 2017, wherein we are determined 
to preserve the ability of Members to 
engage in extended debate when bills 
are on the Senate floor, has been un-
dermined by the filibuster by making 
it hard to get bills on the floor and 
then guaranteeing, when they are on 
the floor, that nobody needs to show 
up. 
Other things have happened since 
2017. I needn’t go over them at length, 
but I will go over them. 
I didn’t imagine that we would have 
a President who would lead an assault 
on American democracy, who would lie 
and claim he won the popular vote in 
2016 when he didn’t, who would claim 
there was massive fraud in the Virginia 
election in 2016 when there wasn’t, and 
who would go to a foreign country and 
try to dig up dirt on a political oppo-
nent he feared in 2020. I didn’t imagine 
that those things would happen. 
I didn’t imagine that the President, 
having lost an election in November 
2020, would encourage his followers to 
gather in DC to be wild. I didn’t imag-
ine that he would call the head of the 
Georgia elections and say: You have to 
find me thousands of votes so I can 
win. I didn’t imagine those things. 
I didn’t imagine that there would be 
a violent attack here that would injure 
150 police officers, that there would be 
an effort to disenfranchise 80 million 
Americans and disrupt the peaceful 
transfer of power. I didn’t imagine 
those things. 
I didn’t imagine that States would do 
what my colleague from California has 
suggested: Look at what happened in 
2020, embrace the Trump Big Lie, and 
decide then, boy, we have really got to 
carve this back. We have got to carve 
this back dramatically and make it 
harder for particular groups of people 
who live in particular cities or coun-
ties, based on whom they vote for, to 
vote. I didn’t imagine those things. 
I will tell you something else I didn’t 
imagine. I didn’t imagine that we 
wouldn’t get any help from the Repub-
lican Party in addressing these prob-
lems. The Republican Party through-
out most of its history has been a great 
voting rights party. The 14th Amend-
ment and the 15th Amendment only 
passed with Republican votes to guar-
antee people equal access to the ballot. 
When the 19th Amendment was passed, 
guaranteeing women the right to vote, 
it was in a Democratic administration, 
the Wilson administration, but Repub-
licans were solidly on board. When the 
26th Amendment passed to give the 
franchise to 18-year-olds, it was in the 
Nixon administration, and Democrats 
and Republicans were on board. 
The Republican Party, from its ori-
gins, right before Lincoln was Presi-
dent, was always on the march and, 
frankly, usually leading the march to 
expand people’s ability to participate 
in voting. There is no example that is 
more dramatic than the passage of the 
1965 Voting Rights Act. 
There was a 60-day filibuster here on 
the Senate floor. At the end, it was 
broken. Republicans voted for the Vot-
ing Rights Act near unanimously. 
Democrats were strong but not as solid 
as the Republicans were. Then, over 
and over again in the years between 
1965 and up through 2006, Republicans 
would vote unanimously or near unani-
mously 
to 
reauthorize 
the 
Voting 
Rights Act. But something changed be-
tween 
2006 
and 
2013. 
Something 
changed at about the time that Barack 
Obama was elected President of the 
United States. 
When the Supreme Court of the 
United States, in the Shelby case, gut-
ted the preclearance provisions of the 
Voting Rights Act but told Congress 
‘‘You can fix it’’ and we went back to 
all of the Republicans who had sup-
ported the Voting Rights Act from 1965 
to 2006 and said ‘‘OK. The Supreme 
Court says here is what is wrong, and 
we can fix it,’’ we have not been able to 
find 
any—any—Republican 
support 
save LISA MURKOWSKI of this Chamber, 
who is a cosponsor of the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act, the restoration of 
preclearance. 
When I signed the letter in 2017, I 
could not have imagined that we could 
not have found any Republican support 
on any voting rights issue. 
I heard my colleague from Utah, Sen-
ator ROMNEY, talk a second ago, and he 
said: Well, how come Democrats didn’t 
do it? I started working with Repub-
licans in July—months before we filed 
the Freedom to Vote Act. Could you do 
it this way? Could you do it that way? 
What about if we completely gave up 
the idea of any rule or filibuster re-
form. Would you then engage with us?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S262 
January 18, 2022 
How about unlimited amendments? 
How about give us a counterproposal? 
I have been in these discussions with 
Republican 
colleagues 
for 
months. 
Again, save Senator MURKOWSKI on the 
John Lewis bill, there has been no help 
forthcoming to save our democracy, to 
save voting. 
So, when colleagues ask, ‘‘Well, you 
signed a letter in 2017, and that letter 
said that we should preserve the ability 
of Members to engage in extended de-
bate when bills are on the Senate floor. 
So why are you now contemplating 
rules changes?’’ my answer to them is 
that I am contemplating rules changes 
to do exactly that. We don’t have ex-
tended debate on the Senate floor. You 
can’t get bills on the Senate floor. Our 
democracy is under attack, and voting 
is under attack. Contrary to the pre-
vious 150-year history of your party, 
you won’t lift a finger to protect vot-
ing rights or protect the integrity of 
our elections, but because you won’t 
doesn’t mean we should not. In fact, if 
you won’t, the burden is on our shoul-
ders even more. 
Here is something else, I will be hon-
est, that I have come to understand 
more about the filibuster since 2017. 
Then I want to conclude by offering 
some words of reassurance to my Re-
publican colleagues. 
The fact that the filibuster is now 
used indiscriminately against every-
thing does not cleanse it of the stench 
of its predominant use in our history 
to block civil rights legislation. I 
mean, now we use the filibuster to 
block what might be a nonconsequen-
tial appointment. We use it for every-
thing. However, when the history of 
the filibuster is written in this Cham-
ber, the pivotal, epic moments that 
will get remembered are Robert Byrd’s 
14-hour-and-13-minute speech to try to 
filibuster against the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964, Strom Thurmond’s massive fili-
buster against civil rights laws, and 
Senators from Virginia—Senators who 
held the seat that I now occupy—fili-
bustering against civil rights laws. 
You don’t cleanse the stench from 
the filibuster by just suddenly using it 
for everything. You still have to ac-
knowledge it has played a particular 
role in the Senate. Sadly, that role has 
usually been to the detriment of the 
kinds of people who couldn’t see any-
body who looked like them in the Sen-
ate. 
I occupy a seat that was occupied for 
50 years by Harry Byrd, Sr., and Harry 
Byrd, Jr. It is called the Byrd seat in 
the Senate because the Byrd machine 
ran Virginia politics, and they kind of 
owned it. Harry Byrd, Sr., was Gov-
ernor in the 1920s and came to the Sen-
ate when Carter Glass died in 1933 and 
stayed until he died in 1966. His son, 
Harry Byrd, Jr., was then appointed to 
the Senate until 1983. For 50 years, the 
Byrds held the seat I now occupy. 
I was at the inauguration of our new 
Governor in Richmond on Saturday, 
and I walked by an empty place on the 
Capitol Square where, just 6 months 
ago, there was a statue of Harry Byrd, 
Sr.—the Governor who was a great 
highway builder and infrastructure 
guy; the Governor who came up with 
the idea and worked with President 
Roosevelt to build the Shenandoah Na-
tional Park; the Governor who then, as 
Senator, led this Byrd machine and 
was viewed as the dominant figure in 
Virginia political life during the 20th 
century, together with his son, Harry 
Byrd, Jr.—but the statue was taken 
down. The statue was taken down 7 
months ago. 
The middle school that was named 
for Harry Byrd, Sr., in Henrico County 
was renamed 5 years ago to Quioccasin 
Middle School. Why was that? Highway 
builder, park developer, dominant po-
litical figure, his statue was taken 
down because of what he did in the U.S. 
Senate; that he would write the south-
ern manifesto to rally Senators against 
Brown v. Board; that he would encour-
age Virginia public school systems— 
again, this is as a Senator, not as a 
Governor; he encouraged Virginia pub-
lic school systems—to shut down rath-
er than integrate; that he would en-
gage in one filibuster after the next 
against civil rights legislation, includ-
ing the Voting Rights Acts, and never 
apologized, never admit he was wrong, 
unlike Robert Byrd, who was a Klans-
man before he was in the U.S. Senate 
and who filibustered famously against 
civil rights legislation until he had an 
epiphany in 1968 when he voted for the 
Fair Housing Act and apologized for 
the rest of his life and became a civil 
rights champion. Harry Byrd, Sr., used 
the filibuster for, frankly, what it has 
been used for around here—to exclude 
people from the democracy. And the 
tributes to Harry Byrd and the statues 
and the school names are all coming 
down. 
Even at the university in his own 
hometown, Shenandoah University in 
Winchester, which had named its busi-
ness school after Harry Byrd, Jr., they 
wiped that name off, because the fili-
buster is not just like a Senate rule 
that can be used like anything else. It 
has been used for a particular purpose, 
and we can’t be blind to that. 
But let me just say this, as I con-
clude. I want to offer my colleagues a 
reassurance—those who have asked 
why 
we 
are 
contemplating 
rules 
changes, those who signed the letter 
with us, because it was a bipartisan 
letter. It was led by Senators COONS 
and COLLINS, and many Republicans 
signed it. ‘‘We are united in our deter-
mination to preserve the ability of 
Members to engage in extended debate 
when bills are on the Senate floor.’’ 
For the first time in my Senate career, 
there is a voting rights bill on the Sen-
ate floor, and we will have a rules ad-
justment vote at the end of the day to-
morrow, in all likelihood. And what 
will that vote be? Will the vote be to 
eliminate the filibuster? No. Will the 
vote be to abolish the filibuster? No. 
Will it be to weaken the filibuster? No. 
Here is the vote that we will vote on 
tomorrow: Should we change the secret 
filibuster that allows Members to just 
sit in their office and not take the floor 
and not explain their opposition to 
their colleagues and not have to face 
the 
American 
public? 
Should 
we 
change that secret filibuster into a 
public filibuster, the way it was done 
during the vast majority of Senate his-
tory, where Senators who went to 
block action by a majority should at 
least have to do the work, should at 
least have to come to the floor and ex-
plain to their colleagues and the Amer-
ican public why the majority should 
not act? 
For everyone on the Republican side 
who signed that letter saying we 
should have extended debate on the 
Senate floor and it should not be cur-
tailed, we are giving you a chance to do 
exactly what you pledged to do. For 
every one in our own caucus who has 
expressed reticence about weakening 
or diminishing the filibuster, we are 
giving you exactly the thing that you 
said you wanted—an opportunity to 
have full debate that could go on for a 
very long time and not be curtailed. 
And the only thing we will require is 
that that debate actually happen in the 
view of the American public and your 
colleagues, a fundamental opportunity 
for all of us to do the right thing by 
Senate rules to accomplish the right 
thing for our democracy. I so welcome 
the chance to finally have this debate 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, 
voting rights are really at the heart of 
our ‘‘We the People’’ Constitution. 
I will tell you, every time I look at a 
printed copy of the Constitution and I 
see those three words in supersize font, 
‘‘We the People,’’ I think, you know, it 
is a beautiful thing that our Founders, 
when they were writing the Constitu-
tion, reminded us of the heart of what 
it is all about: not power that flows 
down from Kings or dictators but 
power that flows up from the people of 
the United States. 
And how does that power flow? It 
flows through elections. So if you don’t 
have integrity in the elections, then, 
you really don’t have government of, 
by, and for the people. 
Now, over the course of our Nation, 
we know that we have worked to ex-
pand the vision the Nation was founded 
on, but it wasn’t reached in the begin-
ning. It was often the case that only 
White Protestant male landowners got 
to vote in the beginning. 
And we recognized that every person 
created equal needs to have an equal

January 18, 2022 
part of the franchise, and so we have, 
through battles over more than 200 
years, fixed those challenges. And 
there have been some dramatic debates 
over this, and it hasn’t been easy. 
But I want to take us back specifi-
cally to the debate of 1890–1891. Now, 
this was during a period when, in the 
Southern States, more and more clever 
strategies were being developed to pre-
vent 
people 
from 
voting, 
either 
through the registration process or 
through the polling process. 
Now, in the registration process, 
there would be things like: Explain 
what this letter of the Constitution 
means or how many beans are in this 
jar of jelly beans or other ridiculous 
questions, to which those at the reg-
istrar’s office could say: We are sorry. 
You can’t register. 
And if you got registered, then you 
would have actually the possibility of 
intimidation 
at 
the 
polling 
place. 
There was one case where men on 
horseback formed a circle around the 
ballot box so, essentially, a Black 
American couldn’t get to the ballot 
box, but for a White American, the 
horses would part and let them vote— 
voter intimidation. 
Well, those crude barriers are part of 
history. They are in the dustbin. Great. 
But, unfortunately, there are many 
modern strategies designed to get to 
the same result, strategies to make it 
hard to register to vote. Sometimes it 
is very prejudicial ID requirements or 
multiple ID requirements designed to 
fit the profile that members of one 
party are more likely to have than 
members of another party to bias the 
outcome. 
Sometimes it is taking and saying: 
We are going to be able to have a pri-
vate contractor purge the voting rolls 
of people who haven’t voted in the last 
few elections—knowing that it is being 
done specifically because the members 
of one party are a little worse at turn-
ing out every single election than the 
members of the other party. 
Now, these strategies on registration 
are at one stage, and then there are the 
strategies at the polling place, all de-
signed to undermine ‘‘We the People.’’ 
And 
they 
are 
mostly 
election-day 
strategies. 
What are those strategies? Well, take 
a—have a really large precinct with a 
single voting location in places you 
don’t want people to vote because so 
many people have to get into that pre-
cinct voting place that there will be a 
long line or understaff it so the move-
ment through the polling place is slow 
or put in machines that don’t work 
really well or put it in a location where 
there is no parking, which makes it 
really hard for people to get to the 
polls. 
You might think that these strate-
gies don’t still exist, but I am sorry to 
report to you they absolutely do exist. 
A member of our caucus today, CORY 
BOOKER, was noting that, across Amer-
ica, the average wait time for Black 
Americans is twice as long as the aver-
age wait time for White Americans. 
But in Georgia—in Georgia—in the last 
election, the average wait time was, by 
numbers that I have, 5 times as long 
or, excuse me, 10 times as long: about 
5 minutes in a predominantly White 
precinct, 80 percent-plus White, and 
about 50 minutes in a predominantly 
Black precinct—about 10 times as long. 
So along comes a couple strategies to 
really enable people to vote without 
that type of intimidation. One is vote- 
by-mail, and one is early voting. 
Now, my State of Oregon is quite 
proud of being the first vote-by-mail 
State. So let’s talk about that for a 
moment. Back in the 1990s, the Repub-
lican Party said: You know, we have 
noticed that people who have requested 
absentee ballots have a higher turnout 
rate than those who vote on election 
day. 
It makes sense because they receive 
the ballot in the mail and have plenty 
of opportunity to fill it out, mail it in; 
whereas, on election day, well, life hap-
pens: You were planning to vote, but 
you had to go pick up your child from 
daycare. You were planning to vote, 
but your boss asked you to work late. 
You were planning to vote, but you 
went by the polling place, and it had 
been moved from the previous 2 years— 
another trick—and you didn’t know 
where it was. You went by the polling 
place, but you saw a long line, and you 
knew you didn’t have 3 hours to stand 
in that line. 
So the Republicans in my State said: 
You know what, we will have an advan-
tage if we get all the Republicans—or 
as many as we can—to ask for absentee 
ballots. And so they did. Then the 
Democrats said: That is pretty smart. 
We will do the same thing. 
So the first year I was running for 
the State house of representatives, 50 
percent of the people in the State were 
voting by mail by getting on a list to 
ask for an absentee ballot. 
So everyone said: This is such a good 
idea; why don’t we do this for every-
body and not make people request ab-
sentee ballots. So in the next election, 
which was the 2020 election, essen-
tially, it was all vote-by-mail. And peo-
ple loved it. 
I found out going door-to-door—I al-
ways kind of had a nostalgic point in 
my heart for election day when we all 
go to the polls together. And I would 
go door-to-door in my first campaign in 
1988, and I would say: What do you like 
or what do you not like? And people 
would generally say: The thing that I 
am really frustrated about—and it 
would be some issue for transportation. 
It would be some problem, including 
just simply the potholes in the street. 
And I would say: Well, that is a city 
issue, but I am running for the State 
legislature. But maybe the State can 
help get more money to the munici-
pality. But what do you like? 
Oh, we love voting by mail because 
we can sit at the kitchen table and 
talk over the issues. We are not trying 
to make decisions in the heat of the 
moment in a voting booth. 
We have complicated ballot measures 
in my State. 
We can read through the pros and 
cons. And—you know what—we can in-
vite our children to the kitchen table 
and discuss it with them. 
They really loved vote-by-mail, and 
we went to that system. But it wasn’t 
something driven by Ds or Rs. In fact, 
Republicans controlled the house and 
senate of the legislature in the State of 
Oregon at that time. They controlled 
both chambers. 
Utah went to vote-by-mail. Utah is a 
reliably Republican State. Again, it 
wasn’t to advantage one party or the 
other; it was to ensure that the fran-
chise is available for every single 
American and that there are no she-
nanigans 
on 
election 
day. 
And 
shouldn’t that be what we are all 
about? Because if you really want to 
look at where voting is compromised, 
where essentially votes are stolen from 
our citizens, it is the shenanigans on 
election day, which means vote-by- 
mail and early voting are very impor-
tant to address that. 
So what do we see now in some 19 
States across our country? In those 19 
States, there are strategies being im-
plemented to make it harder to reg-
ister and easier to purge the registra-
tion lists. There are strategies to make 
it harder to vote by mail, including 
saying: There will be no permanent 
vote-by-mail list; you have to sign up 
every single time. There are strategies 
to limit and curtail early voting. 
Every State is a little different, but 
those 19 States that are passing laws, 
those laws are targeted with strategies 
specifically focused on things that they 
think will hurt the turnout of Demo-
crats rather than Republicans, and it is 
just wrong. We need to be blind to 
party divisions when we are protecting 
the ballot box for all Americans. We 
need to be blind to race. 
Now, folks say: Surely, there is still 
not a racial component in this effort to 
keep people from voting. And I would 
like to affirm that that is the case, but 
these strategies often target predomi-
nantly precincts that are high minor-
ity populations: Hispanic or Black pre-
cincts. 
And 
other 
strategies 
target 
the 
young and college students. Why? Be-
cause they tend to vote a little bit 
more to the Democratic side of the bal-
lot. 
And some of these are targeted spe-
cifically at Native American reserva-
tions to make it so those on reserva-
tions have to drive an hour to 2 hours 
to drop off their ballot, and they won’t 
vote in the same numbers as if you 
have a voting location on the reserva-
tion or they can vote by mail. 
So we have struggled. Going back to 
the debate of 1890, down the hall in the 
House of Representatives, the con-
versation was initiated by Henry Cabot 
Lodge, and Lodge put forward a voting 
rights bill that said: You know what, 
things are going wrong in America, and 
we need to protect the right to reg-
ister, the right to vote, and the right to

January 18, 2022 
have those ballots fairly counted. So he 
basically said that jurisdictions could 
appeal to the district courts to get 
Federal supervision on the three crit-
ical stages of registering citizens, of 
conducting the election, and of count-
ing the ballots afterward—those three 
phases. And it passed in the House of 
Representatives. 
And at that time, it was the Repub-
lican Party that backed this funda-
mental right for all Americans. You 
know how many Democrats voted for 
Henry Cabot Lodge’s bill? Zero. Zero. 
Every vote for it came from the Repub-
lican Party. That was the Republican 
Party in 1890. 
In 1891, the bill was here in the Sen-
ate. Well, what happened in the Sen-
ate? Well, a group of Senators said: We 
don’t want the Senate to ever vote on 
this bill. So they spoke at length, re-
fused to give unanimous consent to get 
to a final vote. 
Now, why do we call that a fili-
buster? So, at our founding, the whole 
vision that our Founders laid out was 
that you hear everyone speak, and then 
you vote and you take the path the 
majority favors over the minority. 
Now, they really emphasized—this is 
important—that you shouldn’t have a 
supermajority because they wrote the 
Constitution while they were under the 
Confederation Congress. The Confed-
eration Congress had a supermajority. 
And because of that supermajority, 
they couldn’t get anything done. They 
couldn’t raise the money to take on 
Shays’ Rebellion. The Senate was para-
lyzed over policymaking. 
So the Founders said: Whatever you 
do, do not have a supermajority be-
cause it paralyzes the body, and the 
body ends up taking the path the mi-
nority prefers, who are obstructing a 
final vote, rather than the majority. 
Let’s just look at some of the com-
ments that our Founders made. James 
Madison: 
In cases where justice or the general good 
might require new laws . . . or [new] meas-
ures . . . the . . . principle of free govern-
ment would be reversed. 
He is speaking to a supermajority be-
cause it would no longer be the major-
ity that would decide; it would be 
transferred to the minority. And he 
went on to say the damage that would 
be done if that happened: The basic 
principle of free government would be 
assaulted if the minority makes the de-
cision instead of the majority. 
What possible logic could there be to 
say the path that most people think is 
the wrong path is the path we will 
take? That is what happens when the 
supermajority blocks a final simple 
majority vote. 
And we have Hamilton. Of course, 
Hamilton gets a lot of attention with 
the play done on Hamilton and his gen-
eral supersized role in the early stage 
of our Republic. 
Again, Hamilton was very aware of 
how the Confederation Congress was 
polarized before we got our Constitu-
tion in 1787. He, again, refers to the 
supermajority: It would be, in practice, 
as if you need everybody; and the his-
tory of any establishment that takes 
this principle is the result of impo-
tence, perplexity, and disorder. He is 
referring to the supermajority require-
ment of the Confederation Congress. 
What else did he say? Well, Hamilton 
said—and he uses some language we 
don’t really use today: ‘‘If a perti-
nacious minority can control the ma-
jority . . . tedious delays; continual ne-
gotiation and intrigue; contemptible 
compromises of the public good.’’ 
I sometimes think that sounds like a 
description of the Senate today—tedi-
ous 
delays, 
intrigue, 
contemptible 
compromises of the public good. The 
public good is compromised when the 
Senate is not able to debate issues that 
face the United States of America. 
He went on to say: ‘‘The supermajor-
ity’s real operation is to embarrass the 
administration, to destroy the energy 
of the government.’’ 
‘‘Destroy the energy of the govern-
ment’’? Doesn’t that ring somewhat 
true of what we have gone through in 
trying to get to a vote on Build Back 
Better over this last year, any compo-
nents of it, and trying to get a vote to 
protect our fundamental right and free-
dom to vote? And it has gone on all 
year. We are a year into the adminis-
tration now. 
So in modern times, we now are fac-
ing, again, what was faced in 1890. And 
I didn’t really tell you the outcome of 
that 1890 debate. The House passed it. 
All Republicans came over here, and a 
number of Senators said: We are not 
going to give consent to get to a final 
vote. 
They broke the contract—the social 
contract that you listen to everybody, 
and then, having heard all the ideas, 
having 
had 
a 
debate 
that 
maybe 
stretched many, many days or maybe 
weeks, you vote. 
So the newspapers started to call this 
tactic, way back in the mid-1800s—they 
called this tactic—‘‘piracy,’’ because 
the core principle was being violated 
by people taking over the Senate—pi-
rates taking over the Senate. And the 
common 
term 
for 
pirates, 
‘‘freebooters’’—freebooters, 
that 
is 
where ‘‘filibuster’’ comes from. It is a 
corruption of the term ‘‘freebooter.’’ 
The pirates are taking over. They are 
breaking the deal of America. They are 
breaking the design of the Senate. It is 
supposed to be that after you listen to 
everyone—everyone has made their 
points—you vote by simple majority. 
Now, we have had a particular devel-
opment over the last three decades in 
which the Senate has become more and 
more dysfunctional. I had the chance 
to see this evolve because I first came 
here as an intern in 1976. And up in the 
staff Gallery, I would go up and watch 
each amendment being debated. 
And there was no television. So Sen-
ators couldn’t see what was going on. 
Staff back in the offices couldn’t see 
what was going on. There was no cell 
phone. There was no fax machine. And 
so each Senator had a staff member 
watching the debate. And then when 
the vote came, you would rush down to 
those elevators that are outside that 
door. And when the Senators came up 
from the subway train that comes over 
from the office buildings, you would 
meet your Senator, and you would de-
scribe the debate that had happened. 
And if it was your particular topic 
area, you would describe what people 
back home were saying or what you 
had understood was the key question. 
And then the Senator would come in 
and vote. 
And then, when the vote was tallied, 
there would be 6 or 12 Senators, gen-
erally clustered here, and they would 
all 
say 
‘‘Mr. 
President,’’ 
because 
whomever got called on first got the 
next amendment. There was no set of 
amendments lined up on the Tax Re-
form Act of 1976, which is what I was 
staffing for Senator Hatfield. 
I was very intrigued by the func-
tioning of our government. So I went 
back to college and then dropped out 3 
months later to come back here for the 
start of the Carter administration to 
watch what was going on in our gov-
ernment with a new Presidency. I wait-
ed tables. I volunteered for nonprofits. 
I went door to door for the Virginia 
Consumer Congress, working on issues 
related to renewable energy or energy 
efficiency. But I watched the Senate, 
and what I saw was a Senate that could 
debate issues in that year of 1977. 
Then I came back here after graduate 
school, and I was planning to go over-
seas to work on issues of economic de-
velopment in very poor countries—fun-
damental issues of healthcare, funda-
mental issues of education. But I was 
offered an opportunity to work on 
something here in DC as a Presidential 
fellow, to work on the issue of ‘‘How do 
you decrease the threat of blowing up 
the world with nuclear weapons?’’ 
So I went to work for the Secretary 
of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, under 
President Reagan. Then I went to work 
for the Congressional Budget Office, 
after 2 years of working for President 
Reagan and Caspar Weinberger. The 
Congressional Budget Office works for 
Congress, and I did studies and did 
briefings here on the Hill, watching the 
Senate. And the Senate started to have 
troubles, but it was still pretty func-
tional. 
Nothing prepared me for arriving 
here as a U.S. Senator in 2009, January, 
and seeing the utter decay and dys-
function of my beloved Senate—your 
beloved Senate, the Senate once called 
the greatest deliberative body in the 
world. 
So I started to have conversations 
with colleagues about what had hap-
pened, and I saw that we had cloture 
motions—that is a motion to close de-
bate—one after the other after the 
other and very few amendments. 
Now, on the amendment side, this is 
a chart that shows the decline in 
amendments from the 109th Congress 
to the 116th. The 116th Congress is the

January 18, 2022 
one that just ended. There is a tenfold 
reduction in the number of amend-
ments over those 14 years—a tenfold 
reduction in amendments, a steady line 
downwards. 
Well, that is one symptom of the 
problem, but then there was another 
piece of this problem, which was more 
and more motions to close debate. And 
those motions are designed to be rare. 
So they take—after you make the mo-
tion—a day plus. You have to have an 
intervening day, and then the second 
day after you make the motion, you 
can hold a vote on closing debate, be-
cause it is supposed to be such a rare 
moment, once or twice a year. 
Then, if you succeed in getting the 
votes to close debate, it is 30 hours of 
debate. Well, that takes 2 or 3 days to 
get 30 hours of debate in and then an 
extra hour for any Senator who didn’t 
have the chance to speak. So there is 
that factor. And then, finally, you can 
get to the final vote. 
Those cloture motions eat up entire 
weeks. So you come in, and, on Mon-
day, you file a motion to close debate. 
On Wednesday, you vote on actually 
closing debate because you have to 
have that intervening day of Tuesday. 
Then you have 30 hours, which takes 
the time up of the normal day of 
Wednesday and Thursday, and maybe 
on Friday you get to vote. 
That is what I am saying: Every clo-
ture motion takes up a week. Well, the 
Senate is normally only here 30 to 40 
weeks a year. So if you have 30 or 40 
cloture motions, you have essentially 
taken up all the Senate’s time. But the 
Senate has an incredibly complex, ex-
tensive agenda. It needs to address so 
many issues in healthcare and housing 
and education, good-paying jobs, the 
environment. How do you take on cli-
mate? How do you take on inter-
national trade? How do you take on 
human rights in foreign countries like 
China, which are conducting genocide? 
So many issues around the world, plus 
it has so many nominations that have 
to be addressed. 
I am told—I haven’t double-checked 
this yet—that there were four Cabinet 
positions that required confirmation in 
the first Congress—four. Then you had 
Ambassadors, and you had judges. But 
you had a pretty small number of 
nominations in those positions. Now, 
we have well over a thousand posi-
tions—well over a thousand—and we 
have a nomination process in which 
people are nominated to have a higher 
rank in the military or advancement to 
certain ranks in the civil service. And 
so you have extensive lists that need to 
go through as well. 
So let’s take a look at what happened 
with the growth of cloture motions. 
This is the history going back to 1910. 
We actually only had cloture starting 
in 1917. And, in 1917, you see that there 
were very few cloture motions in a dec-
ade—3 in a decade, 10 in a decade, 5 in 
a decade, 8 in a decade, 3 in a decade— 
less than 1 per year. 
Well, that intervening day kind of 
made sense because they were less than 
one time per year. It was supposed to 
be a rare moment in which you would 
address the fact that some Senators 
were not going to let the Senate pro-
ceed as our Founders envisioned, which 
was, after hearing everybody, to con-
duct a vote. 
Then you start to see in the 1970s a 
big change. I think we have a chart 
that shows it year by year. We don’t. 
Well, this will give you some sense of 
it. So we have—divided by 10, since 
these are by decade—we had growth in 
the 1980s to more than 20 per year; a 
growth in the 1990s to more than—well, 
an average of 35 to 36 a year. In the 
2000s, an average of 45 per year. In the 
2010 decade, an average of over 100 per 
year, taking up an entire week of the 
Senate’s time. 
So how did this unfold? Well, let’s 
think a little bit about the fact that 
that filibuster that occurred in 1891 
was about blocking Black Americans 
from 
having 
power—the 
power 
to 
vote—because if you have the power to 
vote, you have the power to weigh in. 
That means you have a lot of power in 
our society. So there was a deep deter-
mination to keep Black Americans 
from voting. 
That was the filibuster of 1891. And 
its failure in the Senate—remember, it 
passed by a majority in the House, and 
it had majority support in the Senate, 
but the filibuster was used to crush 
this. 
Now, that process meant that, from 
1891 through 1965, when we passed vot-
ing rights in this Chamber, the fili-
buster was used for one thing: crushing 
the political rights of Black Ameri-
cans. 
Now, someone will say: Well, that is 
not quite right. There was an episode 
in 1917 in which the issue wasn’t civil 
rights or voting rights. The issue was 
whether to arm our commercial ships 
against potential attacks by the Ger-
mans. 
And that is partly true. 
In March of that year, 1917, we 
weren’t yet in the war, World War I. 
And there was a group of Senators who 
said: If we arm these ships and they de-
ployed depth charges against German 
submarines or so forth, we are going to 
be in the war, and we will not have had 
a declaration of war. We will be pulled 
into the war by essentially this process 
of arming ships. 
So they spoke at length during the 
last week of Congress, and time ran 
out, and the bill died. And the next 
week, the new Congress started. This is 
back when the transition happened in 
March. And the new Congress imme-
diately said: We can close debate with 
67 votes or two-thirds of the Senate. 
Actually, it was two-thirds; we didn’t 
have 100 Senators here—two-thirds of 
the Senate, showing up to vote and 
close debate. So that was the first time 
that we had a motion to close debate 
since 1805. 
And the reason I say it is since 1805, 
is that our original rules had a motion 
called the previous question. And on 
the previous question, there is a little 
bit of uncertainty of exactly how it 
was used. It sometimes said that, basi-
cally, you got to speed things up so we 
can get to the final vote. Other times, 
it has been interpreted as ‘‘No, the pre-
vious question means we vote; we vote 
on the question before us.’’ But it was 
never actually used, and it wasn’t used 
because there was a social contract. 
The Senate said: We can listen to ev-
erybody, and, then, having heard ev-
erybody, we can vote. 
Fair enough. Fair deal. Square deal. 
So in 1805, when Aaron Burr was in 
charge of rewriting the rule book, he 
said: We don’t use this rule. We don’t 
need this rule. We have a social con-
tract. We listen to everybody and then 
have a simple majority vote, as our 
Founders designed the Senate. No need. 
So we hadn’t had a rule that essen-
tially enabled this body to come to a 
vote in that period from 1805 through 
1917. So it is true that the bill was de-
layed for 1 week. But the new Congress 
immediately came in, created a new 
rule to close debate, closed debate on 
that bill, and passed a bill to arm 
ships. So the only real thing that was 
crushed in those years from 1891 
through 1965 was voting rights for 
Black Americans because the idea that 
you would prevent a simple majority 
vote, as our Founders intended, was pi-
racy. 
Well, in 1965, we passed voting rights, 
and the national consensus was we are 
putting that behind us; we are putting 
the discrimination behind us; we are 
putting the manipulation on election 
day behind us. We are going to have a 
fair opportunity for everybody to vote 
in this country. So the filibuster lost 
some of its taint because it was no 
longer primarily an instrument to 
crush the political rights of Black 
Americans. 
People started saying: You know, 
maybe I can use this on something 
other than civil rights or something 
other than voting rights. 
By the way, it had been used almost 
entirely on final passage of bills. 
Maybe I can use it on nominations, 
to prevent nominations from going 
through expeditiously. Maybe I can use 
it on amendments. Maybe I can use it 
on motions to proceed. 
Let’s take a look at the issue of 
amendments. Prior to the sixties, one 
time, there had been a cloture motion 
on an amendment. 
You know that vision that I saw in 
1976 where one amendment was de-
bated, and then when it was done, there 
were no pending amendments, so the 
next person would say: ‘‘Wait’’—they 
would always say ‘‘Mr. President’’ be-
cause there was always a man in the 
Chair at that point; I am now glad to 
say 
‘‘Madam 
President’’—‘‘Madam 
President,’’ and whoever got heard first 
would put up the next amendment. 
Well, that world started to change 
along the way. People started to ob-
struct not just final passage but ob-
struct amendments. There has been

January 18, 2022 
steady growth in that over time. We 
are now up, in the last decade, to about 
14 times per year or 143 times in the 
decade. 
Then we have the question of the mo-
tion to proceed. You would think—we 
have a legislative calendar, and that 
calendar has a list of bills eligible to 
consider. Someone says: I want to 
make a motion—normally the majority 
leader—to go to a particular item, a 
particular bill on that calendar. You 
would think that it would be like 
‘‘Hey, we are going to go to the elec-
tion bill. Do I have majority support to 
do that?’’ You would have a 15-minute 
debate and vote. You decide to go to 
that bill or not. 
Why would you take up a lot of the 
Senate’s precious time debating wheth-
er to debate a bill? But that logic has 
not prevailed, so we have a continuous 
increase in the attack on the ability to 
get a bill to the floor. Well, in the six-
ties, about one per year; in the seven-
ties, about one per year; four times per 
year in the eighties; more than 10 in 
the nineties—it escalates. 
Here is the thing: To get a bill to the 
floor, if a group is intent on forcing a 
cloture motion, you have to have a mo-
tion, an intervening day, 30 hours of 
debate, and then you have to be able to 
have an additional hour for any Sen-
ator who wasn’t able to speak in those 
30 hours. In other words, it takes an en-
tire week to decide whether to actually 
debate a bill. That is absolutely insane. 
If you want the U.S. Senate to be un-
able to address issues, then allow un-
limited debate until there is a cloture 
motion on the motion to proceed. I 
think most Senators agree that that 
should go. But here is the problem: 
Whichever party is in the minority 
doesn’t want to make things easier for 
the majority. And this really goes to a 
core challenge of our highly tribal par-
ties. 
In the Senate that I first saw, the 
philosophies of the two parties—if you 
were doing a bell curve of each party, 
they overlapped. They overlapped a lot. 
There were Republicans who voted 
more like Democrats and Democrats 
who voted more like Republicans. 
There was a lot more, therefore, bipar-
tisan work. Now, if you do those same 
two bell curves on how people vote, 
there is a chasm. If you do a bell curve 
where the Democrats are and a bell 
curve where the Republicans are, there 
is a deep valley, a chasm in the middle. 
We have become more intensely trib-
al in ways that are absolutely rein-
forced by social media, all those com-
mentaries on various Instagrams or a 
tweet reinforcing the idea that the 
other side is evil, that the two sides are 
far apart, which leads the minority in 
this Chamber to say: Since the other 
side is evil, we will just prevent them 
from ever getting to a bill. If 41 of us— 
and right now, there are 50 desks on 
this side of the aisle, and there are 50 
desks on that side of the aisle—if 41 of 
us proceed to say we will not vote to 
close debate on a motion to proceed, 
you can never get to a bill. 
We have had that happen multiple 
times this year in which my Repub-
lican colleagues voted to prevent us 
from debating voting rights, the pro-
tection of voting rights. What a change 
from 1890, when, in the House of Rep-
resentatives, every vote cast for the 
bill to defend the right to vote in 
America was a Republican vote. Now, 
every vote against debating the issue 
has come from the Republicans. What a 
swap over the time period. 
This, essentially, is a strategy to kill 
bills in the cradle before they are de-
bated on this floor. 
Both caucuses, by the way, have done 
this. When I speak of voting rights, it 
is now my colleagues across the aisle 
who are deliberately blocking it from 
being debated time and again, but on 
other issues and when the Democrats 
have been in the minority, we have 
done the same thing. It needs to end. 
You know, I had conversations with a 
whole group of Republicans last year 
saying: Next year, we have no idea who 
will be in the majority. We have no 
idea. So let’s just have 1 hour at most, 
evenly divided, to discuss whether a 
bill comes to the floor, and then we 
will vote. Instead of an intervening day 
and 30 hours, plus extra hours if you 
didn’t get to debate, you have 1 hour 
evenly divided. If one side yields back 
its time, that means in 30 minutes, we 
can then decide to get on the bill or 
not. 
Thirty hours, an intervening day, or 
30 minutes. That makes a lot more 
sense. We have to end this. 
I have had this conversation with 
nine of my colleagues across the aisle 
and said: Let’s do this. Let’s fix the 
motion to proceed and guarantee ger-
mane amendments on the floor. 
They were interested. Some said they 
would go and take it to their policy 
team, some said they would take it to 
their caucus, and some said they would 
take it to their leadership. Then they 
all said ‘‘Sorry’’ because their leader-
ship said ‘‘No way are we going to have 
kind of the ordinary Senators who 
aren’t in leadership have a movement 
to fix the Senate.’’ 
MITCH MCCONNELL told them: No. We 
will make changes depending on what 
is best for our caucus. And if we are in 
the majority, that is different than if 
we are in the minority. 
So those efforts failed, and people 
keep saying to me: Hey, wouldn’t it 
work if you draw up rules and imple-
ment them with the next Congress? 
Well, we have tried that. My col-
league Tom Udall, who is now our Am-
bassador to New Zealand, was there, 
coming in with my class in 2009. He had 
followed this as well. So we teamed up, 
and we worked on these conversations, 
but ultimately we couldn’t make it 
happen. 
We need to fix the Senate. We need to 
guarantee germane amendments. When 
I say ‘‘germane amendments,’’ I mean 
amendments that are on the topic. 
When I was staffing that tax bill for 
Senator Hatfield, every amendment 
was on taxes. Should we proceed to in-
crease or rein in the tax credit that 
goes—or the tax deduction that goes to 
deducting the cost of your home office 
if you are a teacher in our public 
schools? It was one I heard in a lot of 
letters. There were a ton of letters 
from teachers in Oregon about that. 
I remember that another amendment 
was on employee stock ownership 
plans, which enable you to be able to 
enable your workers to own a share of 
the company. How do we make those 
ESOPs work better? and so on and so 
forth, one tax issue after another— 
nothing to do with highly polarizing 
social issues on a tax bill because peo-
ple knew that when another bill came 
on 
healthcare, 
they 
could 
put 
healthcare issues on that. When one 
came on transportation, they could put 
their transportation amendments on it. 
Now the assumption is, hey, if there 
is a bill that is going to pass, we better 
throw in every idea we ever had be-
cause that is like the only bill that will 
get through the Senate. The result is 
these massively thick bills, which are 
an insult to democracy because in a 
1,000- or a 2,000-page bill, you are talk-
ing about thousands of ideas, of new 
laws, of new ideas being embedded. 
There is no way the citizens can hold 
us accountable when we are voting on 
a bill that is yea thick. There are a 
bunch of things that are good. There 
are a bunch of things that are bad. 
Plus, we can’t even figure out what 
some of them are before we have to 
vote because when the deal is struck 
off the floor because we can’t do 
amendments and because there is no 
debate, well, we are stuck with a big 
bill being delivered and described to us. 
That is not the way it should work. 
That is not good for us. That is not 
good for the citizens. 
Let’s note that what is happening in 
those 19 States puts us at an absolutely 
critical moment. You can think of de-
mocracy as a flickering flame or a 
flame that has to be maintained and 
nurtured from one generation to the 
next. Now, it is our challenge—our 
challenge—because 
laws 
are 
being 
passed on registration, laws are being 
passed on the process of voting, and 
laws are being passed on the process of 
counting that are designed to manipu-
late the outcome, to basically cheat 
Americans out of a fair election and, in 
many cases, cheat them out of the op-
portunity to vote at all or if they can 
vote, not have their vote fairly count-
ed. So it is our responsibility to act. 
I see my colleague from Massachu-
setts has come to the floor. I think she 
is ready to speak. 
I just want to sum up with this no-
tion: The failure of this Senate to act 
in 1891 led to three generations in 
which civil rights for Black Americans 
were suppressed in our country. If we 
fail to act—if we fail to act this year, 
2022, and allow the authentic integrity 
of elections—then we may see three 
generations in which we lose govern-
ment of, by, and for the people.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S267 
January 18, 2022 
You see, voting rights are the critical 
component because if those who are 
elected break the laws or go off track, 
you throw them out through fair elec-
tions, but if they go off track and there 
are no fair elections, they increase 
their power. 
You have to have fair elections to 
maintain government of, by, and for 
the people. That is the reason we must 
act this week to pass the John Lewis 
Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to 
Vote Act that are before this Senate 
right now. 
I yield to my colleague from the 
great State of Massachusetts. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
want to say a very special thank-you 
to my colleague, the Senator from Or-
egon. Senator MERKLEY
has worked 
harder and more persistently on ques-
tions about the filibuster and the pro-
cedures of the U.S. Senate for years 
now and tried to lead us to a more 
functional situation than we are in 
right now. I want to thank him for his 
leadership. 
I know that tonight must be frus-
trating for him because he has tried so 
hard to get us to a better place. But I 
very much appreciate all that he has 
done, and to the extent we make 
progress, we make progress in no small 
part because of his leadership. 
Thank you. 
f 
H.R. 5746 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
rise today to urge the Senate to take 
action to protect voting rights and to 
defend 
our 
democracy. 
Voting 
is 
foundational to our democracy. In a 
strong, functioning democracy, the 
playing field is level. Citizens have a 
right to vote, and neither one side nor 
the other has the right to block those 
voters from the ballot box or from get-
ting their votes counted. 
That basic premise no longer holds in 
America. Let’s be blunt. American de-
mocracy is under attack from Repub-
lican politicians. In the past year 
alone, Republican State legislatures 
have passed laws in nearly 20 States to 
restrict American citizens’ right to 
vote. 
The Republican nominees to the Su-
preme Court have destroyed long-
standing 
protections 
against 
dark 
money in politics; they have given the 
green 
light 
to 
partisan 
gerry-
mandering; and they have gutted the 
Voting Rights Act. Republican dark 
money networks are bankrolling voter 
suppression efforts with hundreds of 
millions of dollars in lobbying and ad-
vertising. 
And for years and years, Republican 
Donald Trump and Republican politi-
cians have spread lies about the integ-
rity of our elections. Last January 6, a 
Republican President, backed up by 
Republicans right here in this Senate, 
provoked a deadly insurrection at our 
Nation’s Capitol. 
And in the intervening year, Repub-
lican leaders have refused to accept 
evidence of President Biden’s 7 million- 
vote victory over Donald Trump. In-
stead, they have fed conspiracies and 
lies that further undermine our democ-
racy. 
Yes, American democracy is under 
attack, and, today, 50 Democratic Sen-
ators agree on the right response to 
this attack. The Freedom to Vote Act 
would guarantee that every American 
citizen can easily vote and get their 
vote counted. 
The act would defend against at-
tempts to overturn the will of the peo-
ple; the act would reform our broken 
campaign finance system and help root 
out dark money; and, critically impor-
tant, the act would ban partisan gerry-
mandering by either side. 
The companion bill, the John Lewis 
Voting 
Rights 
Advancement 
Act, 
would 
restore 
historic 
protections 
against State laws that have the pur-
pose and the effect of discriminating 
on the basis of race. 
Unfortunately, Senate Republicans 
would rather destroy our democracy 
than have free and fair elections, and 
so they support those around the coun-
try who are trying to block access to 
voting and who are trying to rig how 
votes get counted. 
Elections are about the will of the 
majority, but the Republicans in the 
Senate don’t want what a majority of 
Americans want. In fact, the 50 Repub-
licans in the Senate, together, rep-
resent 411⁄2
million fewer Americans 
than the Democratic majority, but in-
stead of taking a simple vote to protect 
American citizens’ access to the polls, 
they want to stop legislation to defend 
the very foundation of our democracy 
from even getting a vote on the floor of 
the Senate. 
Let me be clear. My view on this is 
that the filibuster has no place in our 
democracy. 
Our 
Founders 
believed 
deeply in protections for the minority, 
and those are enshrined in the Con-
stitution and in the structure of Con-
gress. But our Founders made it clear 
that, after extended debate, the major-
ity could always get a vote. And that 
final vote—except in the case of trea-
ties and impeachment—would always 
be by simple majority. The Founders 
did not add a filibuster. With two ex-
ceptions, they insisted on plain old ma-
jority rule. 
When the Senate changed its rules a 
decade later, the filibuster became the 
favored tool of racists and segregation-
ists. The filibuster preserved Jim Crow 
laws and stalled civil rights legislation 
for decades. The filibuster helped block 
the passage of anti-lynching legislation 
for over 100 years. The filibuster nearly 
stopped Congress from passing the 
most important voting rights law in 
our 
Nation’s 
history—the 
Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
Today’s filibuster does not foster bi-
partisanship and compromise. In fact, 
the exact opposite is true. The fili-
buster has been weaponized to inten-
sify partisan division. 
The filibuster is a wicked tool used 
to kill legislation supported by the ma-
jority of Americans of all political par-
ties, and that is true for protecting the 
right to vote and gun safety legislation 
and immigration reform and codifying 
Roe v. Wade. 
The filibuster thwarts the will of the 
people. Today’s filibuster doesn’t en-
courage debate; it promotes power. 
Senators can torpedo bills without say-
ing a single word in public or even 
stepping to the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. This is not how a so-called delib-
erative body should operate. 
Senators should be required to talk 
and vote instead of hiding behind a 
rule. They should have to put skin in 
the game. If Republicans are fine with 
the wave of anti-voter laws being en-
acted in State after State, then they 
should have to come to the floor and 
make that clear. If Republicans oppose 
reinstating the Voting Rights Act that 
passed in this Chamber unanimously in 
2006, their constituents and the histor-
ical record should know exactly where 
they stand. 
Instead, because of how today’s fili-
buster works, we have two sets of rules 
in our country, one for Democrats, who 
want to promote civil rights and lib-
erties, and another set for Republicans, 
who want to take them away. Repub-
licans who want to close polling places, 
who want to limit voting, who want to 
pass gerrymandered maps are hard at 
work doing that right now with simple 
majorities in State legislatures all 
across this country. They face no fili-
busters to stop them. It is majority 
rule all the way. 
And here in Washington, when Re-
publicans want to pass massive tax 
cuts for billionaires and rig our Tax 
Code to favor big businesses, an excep-
tion to the filibuster lets them do just 
that with a simple majority. 
Republicans who want to pack the 
Supreme Court with extremists Jus-
tices who roll back fundamental rights 
and who disregard the rule of law can 
do that with a simple majority right 
here in the U.S. Senate. But a majority 
of Democratic Senators—again, Demo-
crats who, together, represent over 40 
million more Americans than the Re-
publican 
Senators—a 
majority 
of 
Democrats cannot pass legislation to 
improve the lives of Americans. 
Democrats want to raise the min-
imum wage; Democrats want to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs and 
healthcare; and Democrats want to 
protect the right to vote. But too often 
we cannot achieve these goals because 
the filibuster gives the minority party 
an almost total veto over legislation, 
including the legislation we need to 
save our American democracy. 
We can’t ignore Republicans’ at-
tempts to rig free and fair elections in 
this country. We can’t roll over when 
Republicans want to make it harder for 
Black Americans to vote. We can’t 
look the other way when Republicans 
want to make it tough for Latinos and 
Asian Americans to vote.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S268 
January 18, 2022 
We can’t be silent when Republicans 
make voting harder on Tribal lands. 
We can’t shrink back when Repub-
licans work to keep students from vot-
ing. We can’t turn away when Repub-
licans try to keep working-class people 
or anyone who might be more inclined 
to vote for Democrats—keep them 
away from the polls. That is not how 
democracy works. 
In a democracy, the most votes win— 
period. In a democracy, the Senate de-
bates, and then the Senate votes. And 
in a democracy, the people—not the 
politicians—decide who will lead the 
Nation. 
This week, the eyes of the Nation and 
the entire world are on the U.S. Sen-
ate. We can choose to protect the tool 
of Jim Crow and segregation that is 
found nowhere in the Constitution or 
we can choose to defend the sacred 
right to vote. 
I urge the Senate to protect our de-
mocracy and to protect the right of 
every American citizen to vote and to 
have their vote counted. 
Some of our Republican colleagues 
have made the dishonest claim that 
there is no voter suppression crisis, and 
there is no need for Federal voting 
rights legislation. So I would like to 
enter into the RECORD a series of arti-
cles that demonstrate the voter sup-
pression taking place in State after 
State in this country. 
I will start by reminding everyone 
that the Supreme Court—led by Chief 
Justice John Roberts—opened the door 
to all of these anti-voter tactics by 
gutting preclearance from the Voting 
Rights Act and by turning its back on 
equal justice under law. 
So first I will read excerpts from an 
article published in Vox on July 21, 
2021, entitled: ‘‘How America lost its 
commitment to the right to vote.’’ 
The Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan 
lamented in a dissenting opinion earlier this 
month, ‘‘has treated no statute worse’’ than 
the Voting Rights Act. 
She’s right. 
The Voting Rights Act is arguably the 
most successful civil rights law in [all of] 
American history. Originally signed in 1965, 
it was the United States’ first serious at-
tempt since Reconstruction to build a multi-
racial democracy—and it worked. Just two 
years after President Lyndon Johnson signed 
the Voting Rights Act into law, Black voter 
registration . . . in the Jim Crow stronghold 
of Mississippi skyrocketed from 6.7 percent 
to nearly 60 percent. 
And yet, in a trio of cases—Shelby County 
v. Holder [in] (2013), Abbott v. Perez [in] 
(2018), and Brnovich v. DNC [in] (2021)—the 
Court drained nearly all of the life out of 
this landmark civil rights statute. 
After Brnovich, the decision that inspired 
[Justice] Kagan’s statement that the Court 
has treated the Voting Rights Act worse 
than any other federal law, it’s unclear 
whether the Supreme Court would rule in 
favor of voting rights plaintiffs even if [the] 
state legislature tried to outright rig an 
election. 
These cases are the culmination of more 
than half a century of efforts by conserv-
atives who, after failing to convince elected 
lawmakers to weaken voting rights, turned 
to an unelected judiciary to enact a policy 
that would never have made it through Con-
gress. All of this is bad news for minority 
voters in America, who are [the] most likely 
to be disadvantaged by many of the new re-
strictions currently being pushed in state-
houses across America, and for the country’s 
relatively young commitment to multiracial 
democracy. And there are at least three rea-
sons to fear that decisions like Shelby Coun-
ty and Brnovich foreshadow even more ag-
gressive attacks on the right to vote. 
The first is that Republican partisans can 
use race as a proxy to identify communities 
with large numbers of Democratic voters. In 
2020, according to the Pew Research Center, 
92 percent of non-Hispanic Black voters sup-
ported Democrat Joe Biden over Republican 
Donald 
Trump—and 
that’s 
after 
Trump 
slightly improved his performance among 
African Americans compared to 2016. 
That means that state lawmakers who 
wish to prevent Democrats from voting can 
do so through policies that make it harder 
for Black voters (and, to a lesser extent, 
most other nonwhite voters) to cast a ballot. 
And Republican lawmakers haven’t been shy 
about doing so. As a federal appeals court 
wrote in 2016 about a North Carolina law 
that included many provisions making it 
harder to vote, ‘‘the new provisions target 
African Americans with almost surgical pre-
cision.’’ 
An even starker example: Georgia recently 
enacted a law that effectively enables the 
state Republican Party to disqualify voters 
and shut down polling precincts. If the state 
GOP wields this law to close down most of 
the polling places in the highly Democratic, 
majority-Black city of Atlanta, it’s unclear 
that a Voting Rights Act that’s been gravely 
wounded by three Supreme Court decisions 
remains vibrant enough to block them. 
The second reason to be concerned about 
decisions like Brnovich is that the Supreme 
Court’s attacks on the Voting Rights Act are 
not isolated. They are part of a greater web 
of decisions making it much harder for vot-
ing rights plaintiffs to prevail in court. 
These cases include decisions like Purcell 
v. Gonzalez [in] (2006), which announced that 
judges should be very reluctant to block un-
lawful state voting rules close to an election; 
Crawford v. Marion County Election Board 
[in] (2008), which permitted states to enact 
voting restrictions that target largely imagi-
nary problems; and Rucho v. Common Cause 
[in] (2019), which would ban federal courts 
from hearing partisan gerrymandering law-
suits because the Court’s GOP-appointed ma-
jority deemed such cases too ‘‘difficult to ad-
judicate.’’ 
Finally, decisions like Shelby County and 
Brnovich are troubling because the Court’s 
reasoning in those opinions appears com-
pletely divorced from the actual text of the 
Constitution and from the text of federal 
laws such as the Voting Rights Act. Shelby 
County eliminated the Voting Rights Act’s 
requirement that states with a history of 
racist election practices ‘‘preclear’’ any new 
voting rules with officials in Washington, 
DC. It was rooted in what Chief Justice John 
Roberts described as ‘‘the principle that all 
States enjoy equal sovereignty,’’ a principle 
that is never mentioned once in the text of 
the U.S. Constitution. 
In Brnovich, the Court upheld two Arizona 
laws that disenfranchise voters who vote in 
the wrong precinct and limit who can deliver 
an absentee ballot to a polling place. [Jus-
tice] Alito purports to take ‘‘a fresh look at 
the statutory text’’ in this case. But he im-
poses new limits on the Voting Rights Act— 
such as a strong presumption that voting re-
strictions that were in place in 1982 are law-
ful, or a similar presumption favoring state 
laws purporting to prevent voter fraud— 
[qualifications] which have no basis whatso-
ever in the law’s text. 
As [Justice] Kagan writes in dissent, 
Brnovich ‘‘mostly inhabits a law-free zone.’’ 
That doesn’t necessarily mean that this 
Supreme Court will allow any restriction on 
voting to stand—under the most optimistic 
reading of cases like Brnovich, the Court 
might still intervene if Georgia tries to close 
down most of the polling places in Atlanta— 
but it does mean that voting rights lawyers 
and their clients can no longer expect to win 
their cases simply because Congress passed a 
law protecting their right to vote. 
The rules in American elections are now 
what [Justice] Roberts and his five even 
more conservative colleagues say they are— 
not what the Constitution or any act of Con-
gress has to say about voting rights. 
Mr. President, Republicans are not 
just content with making it harder to 
vote. They are also passing State laws 
allowing them to replace local election 
officials with those who will admin-
ister 
elections 
in 
their 
favor. 
Unsurprisingly, 
they 
are 
targeting 
areas with huge Black populations, 
like Atlanta, that helped determine the 
outcome of the 2020 election cycle. 
And 
they 
are 
targeting 
smaller 
places, too. As described in an article 
published in the Atlanta Journal-Con-
stitution on December 29, 2021, entitled 
‘‘New Election Board in Lincoln Coun-
ty Seeks Central Voting Site,’’ a re-
placement elections board is planning 
to close all seven polling places in Lin-
coln County, north of Augusta, requir-
ing in-person voters to report to one 
centralized location. The poll closures 
would reduce voting access for rural 
residents, who would have to drive 15 
miles or more to cast a ballot in a 
county with no public transportation 
option, leading to opposition from vot-
ing rights advocates. 
The plan is moving forward after a 
State law passed this year abolished 
the previous county elections board 
and gave a majority of appointments to 
the Republican county commissioner. 
Now, Lincoln is one of six counties 
where the Republican-controlled Geor-
gia General Assembly reorganized local 
elections boards. 
‘‘This is about the powerful flexing 
their muscles and saying, ‘We can do 
whatever we want to do and who is 
going to stop us?’ ’’ said the Reverend 
Denise Freeman, who is organizing 
Lincoln voters to oppose the poll clo-
sures. She goes on to say: ‘‘In Lincoln 
County, it’s always been about power 
and control.’’ 
The remade board is the same as be-
fore, with one exception: A Democratic 
Party appointee was replaced by an ap-
pointee of the county commission, 
whose five members are all Repub-
licans. The elections board could vote 
on the poll closure plan on January 19. 
‘‘Folks should have access to their 
polling locations. They should be able 
to vote without having to drive 30 min-
utes to get there,’’ said Cindy Battles 
of the Georgia Coalition for the Peo-
ple’s Agenda, a civil rights group that 
has been collecting voter signatures for 
a petition drive to try to stop the clo-
sures. 
There is no public transportation 
available in Lincoln County, nor are

there taxis, Uber or Lyft. Anyone who 
wants to vote would have to drive or 
walk to a polling place, or return an 
absentee 
ballot. 
Turnout 
decreases 
when voters have to travel farther to 
cast a ballot, according to a statistical 
analysis by the Atlanta Journal-Con-
stitution. 
Polling places can be closed by a ma-
jority vote in Lincoln County, and the 
Federal Government has no oversight 
role. A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sion removed the requirements of the 
Voting Rights Act for States with a 
history of discrimination, including 
Georgia, 
to 
obtain 
Federal 
preclearance before making changes to 
voting practices and locations. 
And what happened? 
County election boards closed 214 
precincts across Georgia between 2012 
and 2018. That is nearly 8 percent of the 
State’s total polling places, according 
to a count by the Atlanta Journal-Con-
stitution. 
Mr. President, Republican efforts 
have 
already 
succeeded 
at 
disenfranchising 
voters, 
especially 
Black voters. So I now want to share 
the impact that limiting polling places 
had on voters during the last Presi-
dential election in Georgia, using an 
excerpt from an NPR article published 
on October 17, 2020, entitled ‘‘Why Do 
Nonwhite Georgia Voters Have to Wait 
in Line for Hours? Too Few Polling 
Places.’’ 
Here is the story: 
Kathy spotted the long line of voters as she 
pulled into the Christian City Welcome Cen-
ter about 3:30 p.m., ready to cast her ballot 
in the June 9 primary election. 
Hundreds of people were waiting in the 
heat and rain outside the lush, tree-lined 
complex in Union City, an Atlanta suburb 
with 22,400 residents, nearly 88% of them 
Black. She briefly considered not casting a 
ballot at all, but she decided to stay. 
By the time she got inside more than five 
hours later, five hours later, the polls had of-
ficially closed and the electronic scanners 
were all shut down. Poll workers told her she 
would have to cast a provisional ballot, but 
they promised that her vote would be count-
ed. 
‘‘I’m now angry again, I’m frustrated 
again, and now I have an added emotion, 
which is anxiety,’’ said Kathy, a human serv-
ices worker, recalling her emotions at the 
time. She asked that her full name not be 
used because she fears repercussions from 
speaking out. ‘‘I’m wondering if my ballot is 
going to count.’’ 
By the time the last voter finally got in-
side the welcome center to cast a ballot, it 
was the next day, June 10. 
The clogged polling locations in metro At-
lanta reflect an underlying pattern: the 
number of places to vote has shrunk state-
wide, with little recourse. Although the re-
duction in polling places has taken place 
across racial lines, it has primarily caused 
long lines in nonwhite neighborhoods where 
voter registration has surged and more resi-
dents cast ballots in person on Election Day. 
The pruning of polling places started long 
before the pandemic, which has discouraged 
people from voting in person. 
In Georgia, which is considered a battle-
ground State for control of the White House 
and U.S. Senate, the difficulty of voting in 
Black communities like Union City could 
possibly tip the results on November 3. With 
massive turnout expected, lines could be 
even longer than they were for the primary, 
despite a rise in mail-in voting and Geor-
gians already turning out by the hundreds of 
thousands to cast ballots early. 
Since 
the 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court’s 
Shelby v. Holder decision in 2013 elimi-
nated key federal oversight of election 
decisions in states with histories of dis-
crimination, Georgia’s voter rolls have 
grown by nearly 2 million people, yet 
polling locations have been cut state-
wide by nearly 10%, [this is] according 
to an analysis of state and local 
records by Georgia Public Broadcasting 
and ProPublica. Much of the growth 
has been fueled by younger, nonwhite 
voters, especially in nine metro At-
lanta counties, where four out of five 
new voters were nonwhite, according to 
the Georgia secretary of state’s office. 
The metro Atlanta area has been hit par-
ticularly hard. The nine counties—Fulton, 
Gwinnett, Forsyth, DeKalb, Cobb, Hall, 
Cherokee, Henry and Clayton—have nearly 
half the state’s active voters but only 38% of 
the polling places, according to the analysis. 
As a result, the average number of voters 
packed into each polling location in those 
counties grew by nearly 40%, from about 
2,600 in 2012 to more than 3,600 per polling 
place as of October 9. In addition, a last- 
minute push that opened more than 90 poll-
ing places just weeks before the November 
election has left many voters uncertain 
about where to vote or how long they might 
have to wait to cast a ballot. 
The growth of registered voters has out-
stripped the number of available polling 
places in both predominantly White and 
Black neighborhoods. But the lines to vote 
have been longer in Black areas, because 
Black voters are more likely than Whites to 
cast their ballots in person on Election Day 
and they are more reluctant to vote by mail, 
according to U.S. census data and recent 
studies. 
Georgia 
Public 
Broadcasting/ 
ProPublica found that about two-thirds of 
the polling places that had to stay open late 
for the June primary to accommodate wait-
ing voters were in majority-Black neighbor-
hoods, even though those neighborhoods 
made up only about one-third of the State’s 
polling places. 
An analysis by Stanford University 
political science professor Jonathan 
Roddin of the data that was collected 
by the Georgia Public Broadcasting/ 
ProPublica found that the average wait 
time after 7 p.m. across Georgia was 51 
minutes in polling places that were 
90% or more nonwhite. 
That is 51 minutes in polling places 
that were 90 percent or more non- 
White, but only 6 minutes in polling 
places that were 90 percent White. 
Georgia law sets a cap of 2,000 voters 
for a polling place that has experienced 
significant voter delays, but that limit 
is rarely, if ever, enforced. Our analysis 
found that, in both majority Black and 
majority White neighborhoods, about 9 
out of every 10 precincts are assigned 
to polling places with more than 2,000 
people. 
A June 2020 analysis by the Brennan 
Center for Justice at the New York 
University Law Center found that the 
average number of voters assigned to a 
polling place has grown in the past 5 
years 
in 
Georgia, 
Louisiana, 
Mis-
sissippi, and South Carolina—all States 
with substantial Black populations 
that, 
before 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s 
Shelby decision, needed Federal ap-
proval to close polling places under the 
Voting Rights Act, and though dozens 
of States have regulations on the size 
of voting precincts and polling places 
or the number of voting machines, the 
analysis found that many jurisdictions 
simply do not abide by them. 
Georgia’s State leadership and elec-
tion officials have largely ignored com-
plaints about poll consolidations, even 
as they tout record growth in voter 
registration. As secretary of state from 
2010 to 2018, when most of Georgia’s 
poll closures occurred, Brian Kemp, 
now the Governor, took a laissez-faire 
attitude toward county-run election 
practices, save for a 2015 document 
that spelled out methods officials could 
use to shutter polling places to show 
‘‘how the change can benefit voters and 
the public interest.’’ 
Kemp’s office declined to comment 
Thursday on the letter or as to why 
poll closures went unchallenged by 
State officials. His spokesperson re-
ferred to his previous statements that 
he did not encourage officials to close 
polling places but merely offered guid-
ance on how to follow the law. 
The inaction has left Black voters in 
Georgia facing barriers reminiscent of 
Jim Crow laws, said Adrienne Jones, a 
political science professor at More-
house College in Atlanta, who has stud-
ied the impact of the landmark Shelby 
decision on Black voters. Voter sup-
pression ‘‘is happening with these voter 
impediments that are being imposed,’’ 
Jones said. ‘‘You’re closing down poll-
ing places so people have a more dif-
ficult time getting there. You’re mak-
ing vote-by-mail difficult or confusing. 
Now we’re in court arguing about 
which ballots are going to be accepted, 
and it means that people have less 
trust in our state.’’ 
Despite false Republican claims to 
the contrary, voter ID laws dispropor-
tionately harm people of color, rural 
Americans, and poor Americans. 
I now want to read an article from 
ABC News. They published it on Octo-
ber 5, 2021. It tells the story of Texas 
voter ID laws, and it is entitled ‘‘Black 
woman in rural Texas struggles with 
process to vote, advocates say system 
is unfair.’’ 
While voters across Texas submitted voter 
registration applications on Monday, Octo-
ber 4, ahead of the Nov. 2 statewide election, 
82-year-old Elmira Hicks worried she would 
not be able to have her vote counted. 
The Oakwood, Texas, native said she 
hasn’t been able to renew her driver’s license 
for more than a year because she has been 
unable to present the required birth certifi-
cate needed to verify her identity. 
In the Lone Star State, election laws re-
quire voters to present a driver’s license, 
passport, military identification card, citi-
zenship certificate, state election identifica-
tion certificate or a personal identification 
card to cast a ballot in person. 
A person does not need an ID to register to 
vote, or to vote by mail in the state of 
Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S270 
January 18, 2022 
For voters ages 70 and over, an otherwise 
valid form of ID may be presented when cast-
ing a ballot, even if it’s expired, according to 
the office of the . . . Secretary of State. 
If a voter does not possess or cannot rea-
sonably obtain one of the seven acceptable 
forms of photo ID, the voter may file a Rea-
sonable Impediment Declaration and present 
a supporting form of ID, [like] a bank state-
ment, current utility bill, paycheck or gov-
ernment check. 
Hicks and her daughter, Jonita White, said 
they were unaware of the RID process, and 
that without a driver’s license and limited 
transportation, it’s difficult for Hicks to par-
ticipate in state and federal elections. 
‘‘My voice does not count.’’ Hicks told ABC 
News. ‘‘It’s very important. People have died 
just to vote, people have stood in line, in the 
rain, women fought to vote and now I can’t 
vote.’’ 
Like many Black elders in the South, 
Hicks was born at a time when records 
weren’t kept. She never had a birth certifi-
cate. Her daughter has helped her apply for 
one. The pair even went to court over the 
issue, and said a judge ruled in their favor. 
Still, they said the Office of Vital Statistics 
rejected Hicks because she filled out an out-
dated form. 
‘‘I do feel like the laws right now are tar-
geting my mother and other African Ameri-
cans in this country,’’ White said. 
Eight state constitutional amendments 
ranging from taxes to judicial eligibility will 
be up for a vote on Nov. 2, in an election 
that, as of now, Hicks [cannot] participate 
in. 
Advocates warn that potentially thousands 
of predominantly minority voters could be 
disenfranchised due to voter identification 
requirements, which could have large impli-
cations during next year’s midterm elections 
for state and congressional races. 
‘‘It’s often very common for people of a 
certain age not to have a birth certificate. I 
want to emphasize it’s not as uncommon as 
people might believe,’’ said Franita Tolson, 
the vice dean for faculty and academic af-
fairs and a professor of law at the University 
of Southern California Gould School of Law. 
‘‘In this country, race correlates to a lot of 
different characteristics. So, for example, if 
you take voter identification laws . . . peo-
ple of color, so African Americans, Latinos, 
will be less likely to have the underlying 
documents that you need in order to get the 
ID in the first place in order to get a driver’s 
license,’’ Tolson [said]. 
Texas recently passed the Election Integ-
rity Protection Act, one of the most restric-
tive voting laws in the country. It bans 
drive-thru voting, enlists new regulations for 
early voting and enacts new ID requirements 
for mail-in voting. 
While Tolson does not believe all voter 
identification requirements are discrimina-
tory, she called Texas’ voter ID measures 
‘‘racist’’ 
during 
a 
Congressional 
Sub-
committee hearing on September 22 because 
she believes they disproportionately impact 
voters of color. 
‘‘Texas has very restrictive voter ID law,’’ 
Tolson said. ‘‘If you read it, it doesn’t seem 
racist on its face, but if you think about how 
it operates in practice, as well as the intent 
behind it, it is fairly racist. For example, 
Texas’ law only allows voters to have a cer-
tain limited amount of IDs. You have to 
have a driver’s license, you can have a . . . 
handgun license, you can have a military ID, 
but you can’t have a federal ID, or you can’t 
have a student ID, which are types of IDs 
that people of color are more likely to 
have.’’ 
White said obtaining an election identi-
fication is not so easy for an 82-year-old 
woman who lives in a rural area without the 
convenient ability to drive herself to the De-
partment of Public Safety. 
‘‘My challenge is it’s taking so long to get 
this done,’’ White said. ‘‘And to send my 
mother through all of these hoops at this age 
to go get documents notarized, to go get her 
Social Security application, We’re having to 
look for high school records and baptism in-
formation . . . To send her through such a 
process, it really is ridiculous.’’ 
Latino communities have also been 
at the forefront of the fight for social, 
racial, and economic justice, but Re-
publican gerrymandering is silencing 
these communities as described in the 
following article, published by the 
Brennan Center, on November 14, 2021, 
entitled ‘‘It’s Time to Stop Gerry-
mandering Latinos out of Political 
Power.’’ 
In 2020, Latinos made up just 1 percent of 
all local and federal elected officials, despite 
being 18 percent of the population. 
In fact, the 2020 census results show that 
Latinos made up over half the country’s pop-
ulation growth from 2010 to 2020, adding 11.6 
million people to their total numbers—more 
by far than any other ethnic group in abso-
lute terms. Latinos are already the largest 
minority group in 21 states, and in California 
and New Mexico they have already surpassed 
non-Latino whites as the largest single eth-
nic group in the state. In Texas, they are 
poised to do the same. 
In states where growth among Latinos and 
other people of color threaten the political 
status quo, lawmakers are already beginning 
to gerrymander Latino communities out of 
their political voice, packing them into 
fewer and fewer districts to circumscribe 
their electoral power or dispersing Latino 
communities across multiple districts in 
order to dilute their voting strength. In 
Texas, for example, lawmakers recently 
passed a new congressional map that reduced 
the number of Latino-majority districts—de-
spite the fact that the state has actually 
added 2 million Latinos since 2010. 
This isn’t a new tactic. Last decade, Texas 
failed to create any new electoral opportuni-
ties for Latinos despite rapid and con-
centrated Latino growth, leading to years of 
drawn-out litigation over the discriminatory 
scheme. Likewise, successful litigation in 
Florida 
demonstrated 
that 
lawmakers 
packed Latino voters into already heavily 
Democratic districts to shore up Republican 
districts at the expense of Latino voters. 
Even in states under Democratic control, 
like Illinois and Washington, Latinos are 
often shuffled between different districts to 
bolster safe Democratic seats and denied the 
equal opportunity to elect representatives of 
their choice. 
Even with record turnout in 2020, Latino 
voters were, by many accounts, neglected by 
Republican and Democratic campaigns alike. 
This comes at a time when Latino commu-
nities are in particular need of responsive-
ness from lawmakers. Over the course of the 
pandemic, Latinos have been 2.8 times more 
likely to die of COVID–19 and suffered more 
economic and job losses than other Ameri-
cans. And since the pandemic began, Latino 
adults were more likely to get evicted and 
their children more likely to fall behind in 
school than their white peers. 
But rather than address the concerns and 
desires of this growing body of constituents, 
many states, like Texas and Florida, have in-
stead created new barriers to the ballot box. 
Anti-Latino redistricting practices are oc-
curring amid the biggest voter suppression 
push in decades—much of it aimed at dimin-
ishing the growing power of Latino commu-
nities. 
These attacks on Latino voters have deep 
roots in historical prejudice and violence 
going back over a century. Often erased in 
U.S. history books, violent mobs are esti-
mated to have killed thousands of people of 
Mexican descent in the early 20th century. 
Forgotten too is the campaign by state and 
local officials to ‘‘repatriate’’ (that is, forc-
ibly move to Mexico) an estimated 2 million 
Mexican Americans during the Great Depres-
sion, many of whom were U.S. citizens. 
Later, even the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
failed to initially protect Puerto Ricans 
from English literacy tests at the New York 
polls—‘‘language 
minorities’’ 
weren’t 
in-
cluded in the law until 10 years after its pas-
sage. 
Though the Latino population has 
grown and grown more diverse over the 
past 50 years, the pattern of discrimi-
nation remains strikingly unchanged. 
Every day, lawmakers across the coun-
try are recycling the bad map-drawing 
practices that have stymied Latino po-
litical opportunity for decades. Voters 
and advocates can challenge these 
maps in court, but they will be ham-
pered by courts’ restrictive interpreta-
tion of voting rights laws and the abil-
ity for map drawers, after the Supreme 
Court green-lighted partisan gerry-
mandering, to claim that Latinas were 
targeted for partisan reasons, not for 
their ethnicity. And that is why it is 
more urgent than ever that Congress 
repair and strengthen the Nation’s vot-
ing rights laws by passing the John R. 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
and the Freedom to Vote Act. 
Asian-American voters are turning 
out at record levels, and it is no coinci-
dence that Republican State legisla-
tures are responding with new laws to 
suppress their voices. 
I will now read from an NBC News ar-
ticle from March 31, 2021, about the ef-
fect of Georgia’s recently enacted voter 
suppression law on Asian-American 
voters. This is entitled ‘‘Asian Amer-
ican voter rights in Georgia hit record 
high. 
How 
voting 
bill 
threatens 
progress.’’ 
While new data shows Asian Americans 
had record turnout in Georgia in the last 
election, a new law that restricts voting in 
the state threatens their participation in the 
political process, particularly at a time 
when they also have the highest rates of ab-
sentee voting, critics say. 
The new legislation, passed with the over-
whelming support of Republicans in the 
state Legislature last week, adds restrictions 
to absentee and early voting, among other 
forms of balloting. Critics say the law could 
disproportionately affect communities of 
color, including Asian Americans, whose vot-
ing population already confronts significant 
barriers to civic engagement. 
The bill, activists say, is particularly 
alarming in light of a recent analysis by the 
policy nonprofit AAPI Data on turnout in 
battleground states that showed a historic 84 
percent vote gain in Georgia by Asian Amer-
icans from 2016 to 2020—a result, in part, of 
aggressive community outreach. 
‘‘Voters of color, including Asian American 
voters, have shown their electoral power in 
Georgia,’’ Phi Nguyen, a litigation director 
for Asian Americans Advancing Justice-At-
lanta told NBC. . . . ‘‘And now some elected 
leaders want to try to suppress those voices 
rather than be accountable to a diverse, mul-
tiracial, multiethnic electorate.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S271 
January 18, 2022 
Critics said that the bill—which was fast 
tracked through the state House and Senate 
and signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp 
in just over an hour—was passed without 
public notice to advocates or voters. The 
sweeping 
legislation 
criminalizes 
‘‘line 
warming,’’ the practice of offering food and 
water to voters waiting to vote, and allows 
the Georgia Legislature to take power from 
local boards of election. 
In regards to absentee and early voting, 
the earliest date a voter can request a ballot 
is 11 weeks ahead of an election, less than 
half the time before the law [before the law 
was passed]. And the deadline to complete 
the ballots has been moved up as well. Both 
requesting and returning ballots requires 
identification, such as a driver’s license 
number, state ID number or a copy of an ac-
ceptable voter ID. 
The 
restrictions 
on 
absentee 
voting, 
Nguyen said, are particularly concerning 
given that Asian Americans voted by mail at 
the highest rate compared to all other racial 
groups in the general election. Voting data 
from November showed that in 13 of the most 
contested 
battleground 
states, 
including 
Georgia, AAPI early and absentee voting 
rose almost 300 percent from 2016 [to 2020]. 
Nguyen further pointed out that any laws 
that make voting more challenging have a 
particularly amplified impact on those who 
are limited English proficient, or people who 
have difficulty communicating in English. 
The Asian American population has some of 
the highest rates of limited English pro-
ficiency. And according to Pew Research, 
Asian Americans are the only group made up 
of a majority of naturalized immigrants, who 
account for two-thirds of the electorate. 
With a high immigrant population, Asian 
Americans face barriers beyond just lan-
guage, Karthick Ramakrishnan, [an] asso-
ciate dean [for] the University of California 
Riverside School of Public Policy and found-
er of AAPI Data, said. Because the majority 
of the electorate is foreign born, most Asian 
Americans most likely did not grow up in a 
[Democratic] or [a] Republican household, he 
said. For those who were able to get college 
degrees, they probably attended universities 
in their home country, which influenced 
their knowledge of the political process. 
‘‘What that means is that the political 
awakening and consciousness and even infor-
mation about where the party stands on 
issues 
and 
where 
candidates 
stand 
on 
issues—the barriers are pretty high beyond 
the language barriers,’’ he said. ‘‘You com-
bine that with the fact that parties and can-
didates traditionally have not reached out to 
them. It’s asking a lot for someone to make 
a decision when they don’t have all that 
background information, and no one is 
reaching out to them.’’ 
Given the added work that is required by 
immigrants to seek out this information, 
Nguyen noted that ‘‘they are more likely to 
give up or feel intimidated in the face of ad-
ditional hurdles or hoops.’’ 
Within the Asian American community, 
those who tend to vote at higher rates also 
tend to be more proficient in English, and 
have higher incomes and higher education. 
. . . Many are also homeowners as opposed to 
renters. Voter suppression laws . . . would 
result in a distorted representation of the 
Asian American population. 
‘‘All of these factors matter. . . . They dis-
proportionately hurt populations that are 
lower income, lower education, renters, 
younger people’’. . . . ‘‘You get a skew in 
terms of communities of color less likely to 
be represented. Even within those commu-
nities you will get a class skew and an age 
skew in terms of who has a voice.’’ . . . 
Ultimately, people should be pushing for 
more ways to make voting easier and pull 
more people toward civic engagement . . . 
adding that even if lawmakers are genuinely 
concerned about voter fraud, it occurs far 
more infrequently than voter suppression, of 
which there are widespread examples. 
Previous research suggests that there is 
little to no voter fraud and a Harvard study 
on double voting, one of the most frequently 
cited examples of fraud, suggests . . . it’s 
‘‘not . . . carried out in such a systematic 
way that it presents a threat to the integrity 
of American elections.’’ 
‘‘This is a serious reminder of how impor-
tant political and civic education is for our 
most vulnerable communities.’’ 
For far too long, Native communities 
have faced massive challenges in exer-
cising their right to vote. Voter sup-
pression efforts in Montana, as illus-
trated by this Mic article from July 6, 
2021, are just one example of recent ef-
forts to disenfranchise Native voters. 
The article is entitled ‘‘Montana is 
ground zero for Native American voter 
suppression—and the fight against it.’’ 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned 
discriminatory voting practices and 
gave Native American communities 
the right to vote, in theory. Most of us 
know now that even with the Voting 
Rights Act in place, voter suppression 
is still going strong. In Montana, Na-
tive Americans are fighting new Re-
publican laws that further restrict 
their ability to vote. 
This year, Montana Democratic Gov-
ernor Steve Bullock, who served for 8 
years, was replaced by Republican Greg 
Gianforte. With a Democrat no longer 
holding veto power, State Republicans 
took advantage of the Governor’s elec-
tion by passing two new voting law 
bills—house bill 176, which eliminates 
same-day voter registration, and house 
bill 530, which makes it illegal for peo-
ple to distribute or collect mail-in bal-
lots if they are being paid to do so. 
Per the National Congress of Amer-
ican Indians, the turnout rate amongst 
Native voters is up to 10 percentage 
points lower than any other racial 
group. In 2019, the Brennan Center re-
ported that restrictive voting laws 
throughout the country continued to 
disproportionately impact Native com-
munities. 
On the surface, preventing people 
from being paid to collect ballots 
might seem like an OK idea, but in 
Montana, local nonprofits like Western 
Native Voice and Montana Native 
Voice pay people to collect and dis-
tribute ballots as an important part of 
their voting strategy. Without this 
practice, many people would be unable 
to cast their ballots at all. 
For example, the New York Times re-
ported the story of Laura Roudine, a 
resident of the Blackfeet Indian Res-
ervation, who had emergency open- 
heart surgery only a week before the 
2020 election. Because of the risks that 
coronavirus posed, neither Roudine nor 
her husband could vote in person. 
Home delivery wasn’t an option either 
because it doesn’t exist in her area of 
the reservation. Instead, the Times re-
ported, the couple relied on Renee 
LaPlant, a Blackfeet community orga-
nizer with Western Native Voice, who 
took applications and ballots back and 
forth between their home and one of 
the only two satellite election offices 
located on the 2,300-square-mile res-
ervation. The new laws signed by 
Gianforte would make this practice il-
legal. 
Native American communities in 
Montana are organizing against these 
voter suppression efforts. In May, the 
ACLU of Montana and the Native 
American Rights Fund sued on behalf 
of several Native voting rights organi-
zations and four Montana Tribal com-
munities, stating that the new laws 
will disenfranchise Native voters in the 
State. 
I know I am running low on time. I 
will not be able to speak to the ques-
tion of the student vote and how Re-
publican legislatures are doing all they 
can to keep young voters from voting 
because they are more likely to vote 
Democratic or to speak on felon dis-
enfranchisement and what that means 
in our democracy. I am not able to 
speak on these, but it does not mean 
that I do not think they are important; 
it just reminds us of the magnitude of 
this problem. 
Voter suppression laws have dev-
astating consequences for real Ameri-
cans every day, so I want to conclude 
my remarks today with the story of 
Crystal Mason, which is told in the 
New York Times on April 6, 2021, in an 
article entitled ‘‘Crystal Mason Was 
Sentenced to Five Years Behind Bars 
Because She Voted.’’ 
Whenever you hear Republican rants about 
widespread voter fraud supposedly under-
mining Americans’ faith in the integrity of 
their elections, remember the story of Crys-
tal Mason. 
Ms. Mason, a 46-year-old grandmother from 
the Fort Worth area, has been in the news off 
and on since 2016, when Texas prosecutors de-
cided she was a vote fraudster so dangerous 
that justice demanded she be sentenced to 
five years behind bars. 
Her offense? Visiting her local precinct on 
Election Day that year and casting a provi-
sional ballot for president. Ms. Mason was 
not eligible to vote at the time because she 
was on supervised release after serving a 
prison term for federal tax fraud. Texas, like 
many states, bars those with criminal 
records from voting until they have finished 
all terms of their sentence. 
Ms. Mason, who had only recently returned 
home to her three children and had gone to 
the polls that day at the urging of her moth-
er, said she did not realize she wasn’t al-
lowed to cast a ballot. When poll workers 
couldn’t find her name on the rolls, they as-
sumed it was a clerical error and suggested 
she fill out the provisional ballot. 
Provisional ballots are a useful way to deal 
with questions about a voter’s eligibility 
that can’t be resolved at the polling place. 
Since 2002, Congress has required that states 
offer them as part of the Help America Vote 
Act, a law passed in the aftermath of the 2000 
election debacle, when millions of ballots 
were disqualified. Ms. Mason’s ballot was re-
jected as soon as the search of the database 
determined that she was ineligible. In other 
words, the system worked the way it was in-
tended to. 
Tarrant County prosecutors went after her 
for illegal voting anyway. They said she

January 18, 2022 
should have known she was not allowed to 
vote. The state had sent her a letter telling 
her so back in 2012, shortly after she had 
been sentenced in the tax fraud case. The let-
ter was delivered to her home even though 
she had already begun serving her sentence 
behind bars. ‘‘They sent it to the one place 
they knew she was not going to be,’’ said Ali-
son Grinter, Ms. Mason’s lawyer. 
The prosecutors also pointed out that when 
she cast her ballot in 2016, she signed an affi-
davit [saying] that she had completed all the 
terms of her sentence. 
Ms. Mason said she had not read the fine 
print; she was focused on writing down her 
address in exactly the form it appeared on 
her driver’s license. She was convicted after 
a one-day trial and sentenced to five years 
behind bars for casting a ballot that was 
never counted. 
‘‘It’s a surreal experience to be in a court-
room for these trials,’’ said Christopher 
Uggen, a professor of law and sociology at 
the University of Minnesota who has studied 
the impact of felon disenfranchisement for 
decades, and has testified as an expert in 
prosecutions of people charged with illegal 
voting. 
‘‘You’ve got the judges, you’ve got the law-
yers. You’ve got somebody who often is a 
model probationer called in, and what’s at 
issue is whether they voted. I have over-
riding sense of, gosh, don’t we have other 
crimes to prosecute? It really should be a 
consensus issue in a democracy that we don’t 
incarcerate people for voting.’’ 
Mr. Uggen said that there is a stronger 
case for criminal punishment of certain elec-
tion-law offenses like campaign-finance vio-
lations or sabotaging voting machines, that 
can do more widespread damage to our elec-
tion system. But in his own work he has 
found that the people who get punished are 
more likely to fit Ms. Mason’s description: 
female, low-level offenders who are doing rel-
atively well in the community. ‘‘These are 
not typically folks who represent some great 
threat to public safety,’’ he said. 
You wouldn’t get that sense from how Ms. 
Mason has been treated. After her voting 
conviction, a federal judge found she had vio-
lated the terms of her supervised release, and 
sentenced her to 10 extra months behind 
bars. That punishment, which she began 
serving in December 2018, earned her no cred-
it toward her five-year state sentence. 
Ms. Mason has continued to fight her case, 
but so far she has lost at every step. In 
March 2020, a three-judge panel on a state 
appellate court rejected her challenge to her 
sentence. The court reasoned that she broke 
the law simply by trying to vote while know-
ing she was on supervised release. It didn’t 
matter whether she knew that Texas pro-
hibits voting by people in that circumstance. 
This appears to be a clear misapplication 
of Texas election law, which criminalizes 
voting only by people who actually know 
they are not eligible, not those who, like Ms. 
Mason, mistakenly believe that they are. It’s 
as though Ms. Mason had asked a police offi-
cer what the local speed limit was, and he re-
sponded: ‘‘Beat’s me. Why don’t you start 
driving and see if we pull you over?’’ 
Last week, the Texas Court of Criminal 
Appeals, the state’s highest court for crimi-
nal cases, agreed to rule on Ms. Mason’s ap-
peal. It’s her last chance to avoid prison for 
voting. Tossing her conviction would bring a 
small measure of justice to a woman whose 
punishment should have been limited to, at 
most, not being able to cast a ballot. 
But it wouldn’t give her back the last four 
years of fear and uncertainty she has en-
dured for no good reason. Ms. Mason’s first 
grandchild was born a few months ago, an-
other reminder of how much she would miss 
if she were to lose the appeal and end up 
back behind bars. ‘‘This is very over-
whelming, waking up every day knowing 
that prison is on the line, trying to maintain 
a smile on your face in front of your kids and 
you don’t know the outcome,’’ Ms. Mason 
told The Times in an interview. ‘‘Your future 
is in someone else’s hands because of a sim-
ple error.’’ 
Identifying errors like these is the whole 
point of offering provisional ballots: The 
crazy quilt of voting rules and regulations 
that Americans face from state to state can 
trip up even the best-informed voters, and 
honest mistakes are common. By pros-
ecuting Ms. Mason, just one of more than 
44,000 Texans whose provisional ballot in 2016 
was found to be ineligible, the state is saying 
that you attempt to participate in democ-
racy at your own risk. 
That risk is almost always higher for peo-
ple of color. Texas’ attorney general, Ken 
Paxton, likes to brag about the 155 people his 
office has successfully prosecuted for elec-
tion fraud in the last 16 years—an average of 
fewer than 10 per year. What he doesn’t say 
out loud is what the A.C.L.U. of Texas found 
in an analysis of the cases he has prosecuted: 
almost three-quarters [of those cases] in-
volved Black or Latino defendants, and near-
ly half involved woman of color, like Ms. 
Mason. 
At this point you might be wondering why 
Ms. Mason was ineligible to vote in the first 
place. She had been released from prison, 
after all, and was trying to work her way 
back into society. As more states are coming 
to understand, there is no good argument for 
denying the vote to people with a criminal 
record, and that’s before you consider the 
practice’s explicitly racist roots. There is 
even a strong case to be made for letting 
those in prison vote, as Maine, Vermont and 
most Western European countries do. And 
yet today, more than five million Americans, 
including Ms. Mason, are unable to vote be-
cause of a criminal conviction. That has a 
far greater impact on state and national 
elections than any voter fraud that has ever 
been uncovered. 
Given the disproportionate number of 
Black and brown people caught up in the 
criminal justice system, it’s not hard to see 
a connection between cases like Ms. Mason’s 
and the broader Republican war on voting, 
which so often targets people who look like 
her. The nation’s tolerance of prosecutions 
for the act of casting a ballot reveals com-
placency about the right to vote, Mr. Uggen 
said, and a troubling degree of comfort with 
voting restrictions generally. ‘‘There’s a 
slippery slope: If you start exempting indi-
viduals from the franchise, it’s easy to ex-
empt other individuals by defining them out-
side the citizenry,’’ he said. ‘‘What is shock-
ing to me is that people view this as accept-
able in a political system that calls itself a 
democracy.’’ 
Mr. President, these efforts to sub-
vert our democracy cannot be allowed 
to stand. Congress must pass the Free-
dom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act imme-
diately to protect free and fair elec-
tions across this Nation. And if Senate 
Republicans will not join us, then we 
must reform the filibuster. We must 
pass this vital legislation. Our democ-
racy depends on it.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, had 
there been a recorded vote, I would 
have voted no on the motion to lay be-
fore the Senate the House Message to 
accompany H.R. 5746. 
f 
S. 2972 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on Fri-
day I was made aware that due to an 
administrative error, Senator WARREN 
was mistakenly added as a cosponsor 
to S. 2972, my bill to repeal section 230 
of the Communications Act of 1934. The 
error was made through no fault of 
Senator WARREN
or her staff. I am 
working with the cloakroom to ensure 
her name is removed from the bill as 
soon as possible.

RECOGNIZING 20 YEARS OF THE 
VILLAGE MOVEMENT 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to 
honor a dedicated and creative organi-
zation serving communities through-
out Oregon and the Nation, celebrating 
20 years of allowing senior citizens to 
stay in their homes while providing ac-
cess to affordable care and community. 
The Village Movement is founded on 
the principle of neighborliness and pro-
vides comfort, care, and affordability 
while maintaining dignity. 
This wonderful movement started in 
2002 with a group of community-dedi-
cated friends who did not want to leave 
their community in retirement. Intent 
upon staying, the friends launched the 
Beacon Hill Village in Massachusetts 
to provide residents who were 50 and 
older practical support and confidence 
to stay in their homes and live their 
lives independently. 
This idea soon caught on, with simi-
lar villages springing up all over the 
country, including in Oregon. There 
are now 14 villages throughout Oregon 
bringing services to senior citizens in 
the comfort of their own homes. The 
Movement 
supports 
what 
is 
often 
called ‘‘aging in place’’ by developing a 
nurturing network of volunteers and 
access to services and social opportuni-
ties that are both sustainable and com-
munity-based. 
Every village is member-driven and 
self-governing, allowing them to re-
spond to the needs of each community. 
The Movement has also expanded to in-
clude adults of all ages living with dis-
abilities, preserving the humanity and 
dignity that is so important in every 
stage of life. 
I have long viewed aging in place as 
a bedrock principle for improving qual-
ity of life for seniors and those with 
disabilities. Years ago, I started the 
Independence at Home Program, which 
helped primary care providers visit 
frail seniors in their homes. This 
helped them avoid unnecessary and po-
tentially dangerous travel and remain 
in their homes longer than they would 
have otherwise. 
I have also been proud to lead legisla-
tion as a part of the Build Back Better 
agenda that would put home care on a 
more even playing field with institu-
tional care. These important efforts 
can build on one another, alongside or-
ganizations like the Village Movement, 
to create a rich tapestry of health and 
social supports for Americans as they 
age. 
Without a doubt, the Village Move-
ment has set a fine example of how 
communities can help support their 
neighbors. It is an honor to recognize 
the Village Movement for its service to 
the 
United 
States—and 
Oregon 
in 
particular.

TRIBUTE TO ANDY BRUNELLE 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch, 
Representative MIKE SIMPSON and Rep-
resentative RUSS FULCHER, I congratu-
late Andy Brunelle on his remarkable 
career in government service. Andy is 
retiring on January 31, 2022, after 27 
years with the U.S. Forest Service. 
For more than 20 years, Andy has 
worked with our offices in his position 
as the Capitol City Coordinator for the 
U.S. Forest Service. In this position, he 
has represented both the U.S. Forest 
Service Region 1 and Region 4 and the 
seven National Forests in Idaho as he 
has served as a liaison working with 
State and local government officials, 
Agency directors, Idaho’s congressional 
delegation, and interest groups in 
Idaho on issues of statewide concern. 
Given the importance of the natural re-
sources and species habitat on the 
more than 20 million acres of Federal 
forested land in Idaho he has acted on 
behalf of, Andy has worked on many 
challenging issues over the years. This 
includes working closely with our dele-
gation concerning improving and ex-
tending the Secure Rural Schools Pro-
gram, a vital resource for Idahoans. We 
thank him for his thoughtful, helpful, 
and pragmatic work for the betterment 
of our great State and country. 
Andy began working for the U.S. For-
est Service in 1995 after serving as spe-
cial assistant for natural resources in 
the Office of Idaho Governor Cecil D. 
Andrus. From 1988 to 1995, he was the 
Governor’s key staff person on a wide 
variety of natural resource issues, in-
cluding challenging issues such as 
water quality, Federal lands manage-
ment, and protection of Snake River 
salmon. Additionally, he served on the 
Northwest Power Planning Council, 
Boise City Planning and Zoning Com-
mission, and City of Boise advisory 
committees. Andy also dedicates con-
siderable time to serving on boards of 
nonprofit organizations, including the 
Boise WaterShed Exhibits Environ-
mental Education Center, Idaho Envi-
ronmental 
Forum, 
Ted 
Trueblood 
Chapter of Trout Unlimited, and Harris 
Ranch Wildlife Mitigation Association. 
As we wish Andy well in his well- 
earned retirement, we express our deep 
gratitude for dedicating so much of his 
time and talents to enhancing, sus-
taining, and conserving such an essen-
tial part of our State’s treasures. 
Thank you, Andy, for your decades of 
dedicated work and skilled problem- 
solving on behalf of Idahoans, and con-
gratulations on your retirement. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO LINDSAY NOTHERN 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I con-
gratulate Lindsay Nothern, a cherished 
member of my staff who is retiring 
from Senate service. 
In Ralph Waldo Emerson’s famous 
poem about how to measure success, he 
concludes, ‘‘to know that even one life 
has breathed easier because you have 
lived. This is to have succeeded.’’ I am 
among the many who have breathed 
easier because of Lindsay. He has rep-
resented me, spoken for me, written for 
me, and provided outstanding counsel. 
He has aptly communicated the needs 
of Idahoans and kept Idahoans in-
formed about the happenings in Con-
gress. For example, this includes him 
taking a direct interest and involve-
ment in advocating for Idaho domestic 
violence victims and Idahoans affected 
by Cold War era above-ground nuclear 
testing, 
often 
referred 
to 
as 
‘‘downwinders.’’ He has taken on each 
challenge with great compassion and 
persistent optimism. 
Prior to joining my staff, Lindsay 
was a journalist and worked in news 
management. He also served as press 
secretary for former Idaho Governor 
Phil Batt and campaign press secretary 
for 
Representative 
MIKE
SIMPSON. 
Lindsay has been with me since I began 
my Senate service in 1999. I am so 
grateful my then communications di-
rector insisted on waiting until Lind-
say was available to bring onto the 
staff. Lindsay has been with me ever 
since, moving from press secretary to 
communications 
director 
in 
2011. 
Throughout, Lindsay has been patient, 
kind, empathetic, a great listener, and 
a trusted adviser. 
Thank you, Lindsay, for your service 
to this extraordinary branch of our 
government, and, most importantly, 
your service on behalf of the great peo-
ple of Idaho. I understand you have 
said you have had two of your three 
wish-list jobs—bartender, radio disc

have one job on your list left to do. 
Thank you for diverging from that list 
to be such a valuable part of my staff 
for all these years. I hope that in your

dreams and more. You have certainly 
earned it. Thank you for your out-

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
EXEMPLARY 
CONTRIBUTIONS OF DR. CHRIS-
TIAN EUSEBIO TO THE COMMU-
NITY OF GUAM IN PERFORMING 
OUR ISLAND’S FIRST BARIATRIC 
SURGERY 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a community leader and 
public servant, Dr. Christian Eusebio, and con-
gratulate him on his achievement of per-
forming our island’s first bariatric surgery. 
On the island of Guam, there has been a 
dire health crisis characterized by a long-
standing, tireless fight against obesity and dia-
betes. With more than 10 percent of our adult 
population diagnosed with diabetes, childhood 
obesity rates higher than the mainland United 
States, and cancer, diabetes, and heart dis-
ease among the leading causes of death on 
our island, our community suffers from these 
associated conditions at epidemic proportions. 
Further, a lack of comprehensive health re-
sources and options amplifies this issue for 
those who need unique medical support like 
metabolic programs. Often, this results in 
many of our people seeking specific medical 
attention off-island or, for others, the accept-
ance of their conditions due to a lack of finan-
cial means for accessing treatments unavail-
able on Guam. Amid the COVID–19 pan-
demic, these complex barriers to health have 
been further compounded, but the hard work 
of Dr. Eusebio has emerged as a beacon of 
hope we can cling to as we face some of our 
island’s most challenging times. 
Driven by the desire to make a positive dif-
ference in the world, inspired by his father, 
and motivated by the imperative to serve as a 
good role model for his children, Dr. Eusebio 
navigated a unique path into the field of medi-
cine after earning degrees from the University 
of Connecticut, Howard University, and Ross 
University School of Medicine. While Dr. 
Eusebio has many accomplishments, which in-
clude becoming a board-certified surgeon, the 
first of his residency class to become a Fellow 
of the American College Surgeons, obtaining a 
Professional 
and 
Technology 
Scholarship 
through the University of Guam, and earning 
the Medical Student Resident Teacher of the 
Year Award at the University of South Florida, 
he also proudly represents our island as the 
first person from Guam to obtain the Nizar 
Oweida scholarship for his work in rural sur-
gery. 
Prior to Dr. Eusebio’s bariatric work on 
Guam, no such option was available for our 
people. However, in taking the lead among 
medical professionals for creating this valuable 
resource to our community, he has concretely 
provided a second chance at life for many on 
our island who have found themselves at a 
standstill. Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of 
the people of Guam, offering my greatest ap-
preciation for his commitment to improving the 
quality of health care to our island community 
and the wider Micronesian region. I am hon-
ored to have the opportunity to recognize a 
man who is actively working to open another, 
much needed door to the collective health and 
wellbeing of our people and congratulate him 
on a successful inaugural bariatric surgery. I 
wish him the best as he continues on his sur-
gical journey, and I look forward to seeing the 
programmatic developments he will achieve in 
the coming years.

INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPORT 
SECURITY AND FAIRNESS ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, since 
1938 the intention of de minimis in U.S. trade 
law has been to ease the burden on the U.S. 
government related to processing imports—the 
revenue collected from imports of low value 
simply wasn’t worth the effort. Instead of going 
through a formal process, these low-value im-
ports enjoyed simplified import processes and 
didn’t have to pay any duties, taxes, or fees 
due to the U.S. government. The original limit 
for such low value de minimis shipments was 
$1. 
The government has significantly raised this 
limit since 1938, to $200 in 1990s and most 
recently to $800 in 2016. The latest increase 
has coincided with an explosion in e-com-
merce packages that use the de minimis pro-
vision to enter the United States, currently 
more than two million packages per day. This 
influx of imports that do not pay duties, taxes, 
and fees and provide less data to the U.S. 
government has created a wide-ranging set of 
unaddressed issues, including compliance with 
U.S. laws and American competitiveness. 
Regulators including U.S. Customs and Bor-
der Protection (CBP) and the Consumer Prod-
uct Safety Commission have raised strong 
concerns about compliance with basic U.S. 
laws designed to protect the United States 
from unsafe and illicit imports, including goods 
made with forced labor. Plus, imports that 
don’t have to pay duties, taxes, and fees at 
the border gain a significant competitive ad-
vantage over other similar products, particu-
larly when imported from countries with mar-
kets distorted by government intervention. 
The Import Security and Fairness Act ad-
dresses these concerns by prohibiting goods 
from countries that are both non-market 
economies and on the U.S. Trade Represent-
ative’s (USTR) Priority Watch List from using 
de minimis. The legislation also prohibits 
goods subject to enforcement actions from 
using de minimis and closes the loophole for 
offshore distribution or processing facilities. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
to enact the Import Security and Fairness Act 
and improve compliance with U.S. law and 
American competitiveness. 
RECOGNIZING LT. COLONEL 
FLOYDRIDGE UNDERWOOD 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. HILL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Lt. Colonel Floydridge Underwood’s 
devotion to our nation and his commitment to 
serving the JROTC program. 
Lt. Col. Underwood was born in Selma, Ala-
bama and knew at the age of 7 that he want-
ed to serve in the armed forces. He enlisted 
in the Air Force immediately after high school. 
He rose through the ranks and was pro-
moted to the rank of Lt. Colonel over the 
years. He served in the Air Force for 26 years 
serving through 22 different assignments. 
During his time in the Air Force, he found 
himself leaning towards giving back to the 
community the knowledge he had acquired 
through his service. 
Lt. Col. Underwood was selected to serve 
as the Commander for the JROTC program at 
Pine Bluff High School. He has served in this 
role for over 17 years. 
During his time as the Commander for the 
Pine Bluff High School JROTC program, he in-
spired his cadets to follow this path and join 
the Armed Forces. More than 30 of his cadets 
have served in the Armed Forces. 
Lt. Col. Underwood will be awarded with the 
2022 Martin Luther King Jr. Salute to Great-
ness Award. 
In Selma, he grew up during the Civil Rights 
movement and took every opportunity to stay 
involved in the movement. 
In March 1965, Lt. Col. Underwood, this son 
of Selma joined my friend, late Congressman 
John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge enroute to Montgomery and into his-
tory. 
Lt. Col. Underwood is a great example of an 
Arkansan who has dedicated his life to de-
fending our Nation, educating our youth, and 
fighting for freedom of life and liberty.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN

HON. DEBORAH K. ROSS

Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my dear friend, John Russell, 
who passed away on November 30, 2021. 
John was a passionate North Carolinian and 
his contributions to our community will live on 
for years to come. 
Born on October 22, 1954, John spent the 
early part of his life in Greensboro, North 
Carolina where he was a proud alumnus and 
three-sport athlete at Grimsley High School. 
Music also played a large role in John’s up-
bringing. Growing up, he was constantly sur-
rounded by Opera. His mother Peggy, was an

accomplished Opera singer and founded The 
Opera Company of North Carolina, located in 
Greensboro. John contributed to his mother’s 
legacy by playing a crucial role in the forma-
tion and growth of her company, which even-
tually evolved into The North Carolina Opera. 
Following high school, John went on to at-
tend the University of North Carolina at Chap-
el Hill, graduating with the highest honors in 
English before receiving a Master’s Degree in 
English and Comparative Literature from Co-
lumbia University. 
After graduating from Columbia University, 
John spent a few years as the youngest editor 
ever hired by the Houghton Mifflin publishing 
company before deciding that he wanted to 
contribute to his community in a different ca-
pacity. He left New York to enroll in Harvard 
Law School, graduating with honors in 1985 
before moving to Raleigh. 
In our home of Wake County North Caro-
lina, John practiced corporate law at Moore & 
Van Allen for 12 years. After, he joined 
Quintiles Transnational Corporation and during 
his tenure, he rose from Executive Vice Presi-
dent to General Counsel, eventually becoming 
the Chief Administrative Officer. In 2008, John 
became a partner in the Life Science Practice 
of the global law firm K&L Gates, where he 
practiced until his retirement in 2017. 
John was extremely involved in the commu-
nity and served on many boards and advisory 
roles including the North Carolina Railroad ad-
visory, the Association of Clinical Research 
Organizations (ACRO), Elon Law School, the 
Center for Studies of the American South, the 
Gilling’s School of Global Public Health, and 
countless others. This work is a testament to 
his character and his love for the people of 
our state and our community. 
On top of these contributions, John’s pas-
sion for literature led him to write two novels, 
‘‘Favorite Sons’’ (1992), winner of the Sir Wal-
ter Raleigh Award for fiction, and ‘‘All the 
Right Circles’’ (2019). Both examine North 
Carolina politics, society, and history. He also 
was an avid member of our Triangle wide 
book club, and we enjoyed our time together 
sharing thoughts and opinions about the non-
fiction books we read. 
John lived an exceptional life, and I will al-
ways be grateful that I had the pleasure of 
knowing him. He was a dedicated husband, 
devoted father, and a loving uncle and son. 
He will be forever missed by his wife Kelley, 
children Caroline, Taylor, Katie, Roddy, Fields, 
and Bess, as well as his beloved sister Susan, 
father, John B. Russell, and grandsons 
George and Oliver. I miss him dearly and look 
forward to highlighting his legacy and honoring 
his service to our community for years to 
come.

HONORING ANGELICA ‘‘KELA’’ 
GARCIA 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mrs. 
Angelica ‘‘Kela’’ Garcia of Edinburg, Texas, 
who dedicated her life to serving our country 
and South Texas. Mrs. Garcia was born on 
February 7, 1923, in Tabasco, Texas to her 
parents, Melecio and Andrea Gonzalez, as the 
youngest of eight children. At the age of 24, 
she married Mr. Felipe Garcia, Sr. with whom 
she lovingly raised nine children: Ramon Gar-
cia, Nora Linda Garcia, Thelma Garcia, Felipe 
Garcia Jr., Roberto Garcia, Nora G. De Leon, 
Dalila A. Garcia, Leticia Garcia, and Romeo 
Garcia. 
Mrs. Garcia was the type of person that 
could accomplish anything she set her mind 
to. As a young girl, she wanted to learn how 
to play the piano, so she bartered with the 
local piano teacher, trading milk from their 
dairy cow in exchange for piano lessons. That 
fondness for and dedication to the arts ex-
tended beyond music to the poetry of Joyce 
Kilmer. In elementary school, she developed a 
talent for recitation, winning poetry recital con-
tests at her school. 
After the Pearl Harbor attack on December 
7, 1941, Mrs. Garcia answered the call to 
service. She became part of the historic 
‘‘Rosie the Riveter’s Brigade’’ as an airplane 
machinist in Marfa, Texas. There, she made 
critical contributions to our military readiness, 
work many women had never had the chance 
to do. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I stand here 
today to acknowledge the countless achieve-
ments and charitable acts of Mrs. Angelica 
‘‘Kela’’ Garcia. She devoted her life for the 
betterment of our community, and I have no 
doubt that her legacy will be remembered by 
all who knew her. Her general love for life, her 
family, her friends, and country is admirable. 
May she rest in peace.

munity, and country. I salute two true partners 
in life. May God give them both many years of 
joy and continued happiness together.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 44TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF KOPPER KETTLE 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 44th anniversary 
of the Kopper Kettle explosion in downtown 
Auburn, Alabama. 
Below is the 1978 sermon by Rev. Rod Sin-
clair at the Episcopal College Center after the 
explosion occurred: 
The explosion at the Kopper Kettle has 
consumed the time and attention of many of 
us this week, especially Sunday when it oc-
curred Monday and Tuesday when we were 
fixing ourselves up and getting heat back 
into the building and into the Steven’s 
House. There have been many expressions of 
gratefulness that no one in town was injured 
or killed and we have all told each other 
where we were when we hear of or felt the 
blast. We have even told each other about 
other explosions, other calamities and what 
our reaction was to them. And some of us 
have gone off into the world of metaphor and 
analogy and compared the explosion at the 
Kopper Kettle to what happens to a human 
being who gets poison in his or her system, 
poison from unacknowledged anger or poison 
from unexpressed resentment, and how the 
pressure can build up an explosion. 
There’s another type of explosion occurred 
to me, as it should, being the preacher, 
which I like to look at this morning. It is the 
explosion of the spirit and it can be more 
devastating than what happened last Sunday 
at Magnolia and Gay. 
The explosion of the spirit is what happens 
when all the things we thought we believed 
in collapses, when the world of meaning col-
lapses, when the truths that we always 
thought were true seem untrue, when doubt 
attacks every item of faith and prevails, and 
faith seems counterfeit, and trust wanders 
aimlessly hunting for a place to rest, and 
when other people’s piety bring charges of 
hypocrisy to our lips. The explosion of the 
spirit can hit with the force of last Sunday’s 
blast or it can strike in a slow-motion 
version. Decay is an explosion developing 
slowly. We can rebuild stores and replace 
smashed windows, but persons who are 
smashed by an earthquake under their house 
of faith have no certainty that they can pick 
up the pieces, nor may they want to, for 
their structure no longer has meaning. All 
that was dear and cherished is splintered and 
smoking. Their faith is gone, their dreams 
are smashed, and they have no basis for 
hope. 
What do you do if the explosion of the spir-
it strikes you? First, I believe you must go 
to your most trusted friend, not to talk, but 
to sit in silence—in the presence of the 
other—in the presence of another human 
being. And the truth of the presence may be 
the only truth that is verifiable. 
Next, you must allow your friend to care 
for you. This is more difficult than silence. 
Nor can it come too quickly. This requires 
that you give permission to the other to 
enter your shattered world. And with the 
entry may come judgment (but surely not!) 
and may come abject embarrassment (Yes, 
possibly that) or the painful admission that 
you are lost in the woods and do not know 
the way home. (Yes, that too!) Your trusted 
friend is there to listen, is not therapist, 
counselor or father confessor (at least not 
then) and listens to you talk, listens to the 
starkness of your confession that your reli-
gious house of cards proved to be just that, 
listens to the pain of your isolation—for you 
are in an empty, flat land by yourself with 
not so much as four pegs to pitch a tent for 
shelter. He listens to the description of your 
futureless future. And the echo of the ques-
tion ‘‘What is there now?’’ continues to 
sound in your empty room. 
But your friend does not answer your ques-
tions; eventually you do. Yet no one can tell 
you when the eventuality will happen. First, 
there may be nothing more than the estab-
lishing of a routine; but even routine re-
quires a degree of faith. Later, there may be 
divine word, certainly not acknowledged 
then as such. From deep within, from the 
center of your center, may come the word: 
‘‘Life shall go on.’’ And you know the words 
are true and your house of meaning receives 
another plank. 
If and when the house is completed, that 
is, if and when there is a day when you can 
say: ‘‘I believe that the following truths

gives me meaning, and makes sense out of 
existence, and are the grounds on which I 
will stake my life,’’ if there is a day when 
this can be said again, after an explosion of 
the spirit my hope is that your statement of 
what you believe would include the fol-
lowing: 
First, a trust in God, trust in God as per-
sonal and loving, God who loves you, who un-
derstands and who cares for you. Believing 
that God understands and loves us is the life 
force that prevents us from dying. 
Secondly, a realization that Jesus of Naza-
reth reveals God to us. We are not blocked or 
stumped in our search for the knowledge of 
God. Jesus’ love and forgiveness is the indi-
cator of God’s love and forgiveness. Believ-
ing that Jesus reveals God to us is the life 
force that guards our spirits from collapsing. 
Thirdly, a trust that God is present with 
and in us, and that his spirit, his power, and 
his love are with us and in us, his people. We 
are not left derelict or abandoned, wondering 
if we shall ever be called for. Believing that 
God’s presence is with us and in us is the life 
force that builds us up as a community of 
people seeking to be faithful and prevents us 
from despairing. 
To be able to base your life on those three 
assertions and know they are true is to re-
turn from the land of shadow and mist into 
the sunlight of a new day. 
The person who experiences the bank-
ruptcy of spirit that we have spoken of and 
who later reclaims and rebuilds, who begins 
again and whose faith grows from infancy to 
maturity, has a lot to tell us. My guess is 
that such a person would share with us such 
thoughts as: 
No one else can say what’s true for you. All 
truth is self-validating. 
Much truth, that is not yet perceived as 
truth, can remain on the shelf: it may be 
claimed later on. Having swallowed too 
much once before and exploded, it’s best not 
to bite off more than you can chew. Courage 
to rebuild is an act of faith. 
The process of discovering meaning is an 
element of meaning itself. 
My further guess is that as we met such a 
person, who had believed again after being 
crushed by doubt, we could say such words to 
him or her as: 
When you speak, your words are genuine 
and true. We feel accepted and respected by 
you. 
Your faith is clearly shown in your behav-
ior. 
You will be a threat to those whose houses 
of faith are held together by tape and wire 
and string and who pretend to believe and 
who make a great show, but who on the in-
side are full of emptiness and staleness, brit-
tle-ness and dust. 
You will cause a light to shine on sham re-
ligion and there will be some who will be vin-
dictive. 
The explosion at the corner last Sunday 
can cause us to look at the explosion that 
can come at our centers, the collapsing of 
our spirit, if we have carelessly claimed to 
believe, or mimicked the belief of others, and 
have no faith that is our own. The admission 
of our doubt, painful though it is, can be the 
first step to regaining a life of faith and can 
return us to authentic living in God’s pres-
ence. God’s love is real and His command-
ments are sure and the community of per-
sons seeking to know what it is to be fruitful 
is a rich place to set yourself. May He shed 
his grace on each one of us as we seek truth 
and walk in faith. Amen. 
RECOGNIZING CLARENCE ‘‘TAFFY’’ 
ABEL AND THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
FIRST 
NATIVE 
AMERICAN 
IN 
THE 
WINTER 
OLYMPICS 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 100th anniversary of 
the first Native American in the Winter Olym-
pics, Clarence ‘‘Taffy’’ Abel. Over the last cen-
tury, Taffy’s accomplishments have inspired 
countless people across this nation and the 
world. 
Clarence ‘‘Taffy’’ Abel was born on May 28, 
1900, in Sault Ste. Marie as part of the Sault 
Tribe of Chippewa Indians. He received the 
nickname ‘‘Taffy’’ on the hockey rink for his at-
tempts to sneak taffy during class. He spent 
many summers as a teenager working on the 
USS Clover, visiting ports such as Duluth, de-
livering supplies to local communities. Fol-
lowing his high school years, he joined the 
United States National Hockey Team for the 
first Winter Olympics in 1924. There he be-
came the first Native American to participate 
in the winter games. He was recognized by 
his fellow athletes for his patriotism and lead-
ership, helping him become captain of his 
team and the first person to represent the 
United States at the Winter Olympics by car-
rying the flag during the opening ceremonies. 
Taffy and the U.S. National Hockey Team led 
a successful tournament run that landed them 
a silver medal at the conclusion of the Olym-
pics. 
Following his time with U.S. Hockey, Taffy 
went on to lead a successful professional ca-
reer. After playing for the St. Paul Hockey 
Club for three seasons in the USAHA, he 
moved to the Minneapolis Millers where he 
helped win the CHL title in 1926. Following 
that title victory, Taffy was recruited by leg-
endary NHL owner, Conn Smythe, to play on 
the New York Rangers and then later with the 
Chicago Blackhawks. There he became the 
first American to become a regular NHL player 
in a sport that had up until then been over-
whelmingly played by Canadians. During his 
eight-year NHL career, Taffy went on to win 
two Stanley Cups and was thought of by many 
of his peers as the best left defenseman in the 
league. At the conclusion of his career, he 
played a total of 16 seasons of amateur and 
professional hockey, received an Olympic sil-
ver medal, won two Stanley Cups, and played 
a total of 333 games in the NHL. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the 100th anniversary of the 
first Native American in the Winter Olympics, 
Clarence ‘‘Taffy’’ Abel. His historic accomplish-
ments are memorialized in the American In-
dian Athletic Hall of Fame and the U.S. Hock-
ey Hall of Fame. Taffy’s legacy continues to 
inspire future generations across Michigan, the 
United States, and the world. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
SENATOR J. WILLIAM LINCOLN 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize the late James William Lin-
coln of Connellsville, Pennsylvania, for a life 
dedicated to public service. 
Senator ‘‘Bill’’ Lincoln, as he was known by 
those close to him, ended his long and coura-
geous battle with Parkinson’s Disease on De-
cember 19, 2021. By all accounts, he ap-
proached life the same before and after his di-
agnosis: with action. 
Born in 1940, Senator Lincoln worked as a 
shoe salesman and milk delivery man before 
being elected district judge. After serving two 
terms, Senator Lincoln was elected to the 
Pennsylvania 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
where he served from 1972 to 1978. In 1979, 
he was elected to the Pennsylvania State 
Senate, where he served the people of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 15 years. 
During his tenure, Senator Lincoln was ap-
pointed to the Legislative Budget and Finance. 
Committee, Joint Legislative Air and Water 
Pollution Control and Conservation Com-
mittee, Legislative Audit Advisory Committee, 
and the Joint State Government Commission. 
He also served as the Chair of the Democratic 
State Committee from 1991 to 1995. 
In 1998, Senator Lincoln was diagnosed 
with Parkinson’s Disease at the age of 58, but 
his passion for public service never wavered. 
Following his time in the State Senate, he 
worked as a member of the State Transpor-
tation Advisory Board and was also appointed 
by the governor as Commissioner and Sec-
retary-Treasurer to the Pennsylvania Turnpike 
Commission, where he served for 10 years 
until 2013. 
Among the many titles Senator Lincoln held 
were husband, father, and friend. He is sur-
vived by his wife, Kathy Lincoln, and four 
sons, James William Jr., Eric, Jerry, and Greg 
Lincoln, and their families. He leaves his loved 
ones with not only fond memories, but also a 
legacy of service to his home state. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the life of Senator Bill Lincoln and the 
tremendous accomplishments and contribu-
tions he made to the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania. May his leadership and service, par-
ticularly in the face of adversity, serve as an 
example to us all.

January 18, 2022 
on November 9, 2021. Greg was an extraor-
dinary son, brother, husband, and father who 
loved his family and country. Survived by 
his ever-devoted wife, Leanne, and their four 
beautiful 
children—Connor 
Andrew 
(11), 
Declan Sean (9), Owen Patrick (7), and Fiona 
Jane (4)—his legacy as a dedicated family 
man is showcased in the loving bond shared 
among his children. 
Born at Fort Knox, Kentucky on Sep-
tember 22, 1980, Greg was the second of four 
children 
to 
LTC 
(Ret) 
Dave 
and 
Ann 
McSween. Along with older sister Allison 
(Erik), younger siblings Katie (John) and 
Brian (Regan), Greg enjoyed a tight-knit up-
bringing rooted in his Irish Catholic faith. 
The family endured eight military reloca-
tions prior to sixth grade, as Greg’s father 
was an active duty Army officer, culmi-
nating his Army career in the Washington, 
D.C. area. Family roots were established in 
Alexandria, VA in 1992 and have remained 
anchored to the area since. 
Upon arriving in Alexandria, Greg discov-
ered his love of soccer. This intense relation-
ship carried him through high school, where 
he earned his status as a true athlete-stu-
dent. His love of soccer was second in his de-
votion to escaping responsibility at home 
while somehow juxtaposing a solo effort to 
attain the rank of Eagle Scout, like his fa-
ther. 
Following graduation from Bishop Ireton 
High School in 1999, Greg’s passion for soccer 
carried him to play at Longwood University, 
where he met Leanne (nee Kibler), in Novem-
ber 2001. He, a walk-on three year player, and 
she, a three year starter on the women’s la-
crosse team, cemented a true and imper-
meable bond which led to the creation of 
their own team—Team McSween—in the 
years ahead. Leanne stood with Greg in sup-
port as he attended Officer Candidate School 
while attending Longwood, where he was 
commissioned in 2003 as a Ground Intel-
ligence Officer in the United States Marine 
Corps, following in the footsteps of his ma-
ternal grandfather. 
Upon marrying in June 2006, Leanne 
stepped naturally into her role as the ulti-
mate Semper Fi wife—never a task too great 
to undertake or neighbor to befriend. Greg 
and Leanne welcomed their four children 
throughout their military relocations with 
immense pride as they pursued their shared 
quest for adventure. Together, their travels 
led to exploring 24 countries with wonder in 
their journey as a family. Across five mili-
tary relocations for assignments at Camp 
Lejeune NC, Quantico VA, Stuttgart Ger-
many, and the Pentagon with five deploy-
ments intermixed along the way, Leanne 
demonstrated her tremendous strength in 
keeping all the trains running on time. 
Greg’s last assignment on the Joint Staff at 
the Pentagon finally afforded him the oppor-
tunity to live near family with military re-
tirement on the horizon. 
Greg is also survived by his wife’s family, 
Andy and Susan Kibler, sister-in-law Glenna 
(Geoffrey), 
and 
brother-in-law 
Jackson 
(Amanda). Beyond immediate family, Uncle 
Greg will be sorely missed by nieces and 
nephews: Keegan, Adeline, Eloise, Henry, 
Madison, MacKenzie, Jack, Palmer, and 
June. In addition, twenty aunts and uncles 
and 34 first cousins make up a small portion 
of the extended family that share fond 
memories of Greg. So ingrained in Greg was 
his ability to develop deep, lasting friend-
ships throughout all the chapters of his life, 
and carry that forward despite distance, 
time, and the daily grind of life. 
We join him in the enduring search of the 
perfect pitch, beer chilled to the right tem-
perature, a well-stoked fire utilizing wood 
split and stacked by hand, a perfectly timed 
one-liner 
delivered 
with 
masterful 
dry 
humor, and the warm comfort of a not-too- 
long embrace as we yearn to find peace with 
the Irish Goodbye that was ultimately his 
last measure. We honor his legacy by car-
rying forward his spirit within each of us. 
Cheers to our hero until we may see you on 
the other side.

CONGRATULATING KOBE HALL 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Kobe Hall for winning 
the very first season of the World Wide Dance 
Challenge. 
The World Wide Dance Challenge is an on-
line dance show competition, and the very first 
of its kind, that was established amid the 
COVID–19 pandemic. With a new opportunity 
to engage with dancers from across the world 
using his unique, ever-evolving talent, Kobe 
vied for a winning position in the competition, 
ultimately to provide sustenance as a father of 
two in a time when the economic effects pre-
cipitated by this global pandemic affected mil-
lions of families across the globe. 
After first discovering dance at the age of 
10, Kobe joined Guam’s Stargazers Dance 
Troupe in 2013 and continued developing his 
skills over the next four years. In the past 
year, and along with it the changing world that 
has called on us to spend most of our time at 
home, Kobe embraced a possibility to reignite 
the love for the art of dance he first encoun-
tered as a young boy. Facing off against 1,200 
other skilled dancers in front of a live online 
audience around two o’clock in the morning 
CHST, he advanced through five rounds of 
competition to take the title. Prior to this par-
ticular show, Kobe was also able to secure 
four other titles as a virtual dance competition 
winner proudly representing Guam and our 
people. 
On behalf of the people of Guam, I would 
like to extend a proud congratulations to Kobe 
Hall for his success in the virtually hosted 
World Wide Dance Challenge. Dancing is an 
art form that maintains a rich history and pres-
ence in cultures worldwide, and I applaud 
Kobe for staying true to who he is while using 
his gift to highlight what our small island in the 
middle of the Pacific has to offer. I would like 
to further commend him for using his success 
as a platform for connecting with others, en-
couraging dancers from our community to ex-
plore similar opportunities, and inspiring many 
to pursue their passions. Kobe’s drive, perse-
verance, character, and talents will surely take 
him far, and I wish him the best of luck on his 
journey pursuing a professional dance career.

HONORING THE 95TH BIRTHDAY OF 
DR. JOHN LONG 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to recognize World War II Veteran John 
Long for his 95th Birthday and his service to 
our Nation. 
At the end of his senior year in high school 
in June 1945, John Long was drafted into the 
United States Army. He was sent to Camp 
Wheeler in Macon, Georgia for basic infantry 
training, and it was there that he and his fel-
low young recruits learned that they were 
being trained in preparation for the invasion of 
Japan. 
These 
young 
infantrymen 
were 
being 
trained with the knowledge and understanding 
that a major military invasion was being 
planned that would likely lead to tremendous 
U.S. sacrifices of more than a million casual-
ties. Ultimately, President Harry S. Truman 
was unwilling to sacrifice so many American 
lives and changed the course of history by or-
dering the first nuclear bomb dropped on 
Japan. 
After the Japanese surrender, Dr. Long’s 
First Infantry Division was sent to Germany to 
serve in the Army of Occupation, allowing long 
serving service members to return home. 
Grateful that his life was spared, Dr. Long re-
turned home after his service with a deep 
sense of gratitude and pride and earned his 
Doctor of Chiropractic under the G.I. Bill. 
Dr. Long has always held a strong commit-
ment to his fellow veterans and community 
service. He is a life member of many veterans’ 
organizations and has been recognized on 
countless occasions for his service to the 
community. 
Turning 95 years old, today, on January 18, 
2022, Dr. Long looks back on his dual careers 
as both a chiropractor and dedicated public 
servant with great pride and a deep and abid-
ing affection for his country and his commu-
nity. 
Dr. Long is a true American patriot and the 
27th Congressional District of New York is 
deeply grateful for his service and wishes him 
a happy 95th birthday.

Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I rise

The Knights of Columbus is an international

tues of Charity, Unity, Fraternity, and Patriot-
ism. They were founded in 1882 by Father Mi-
chael Joseph McGivney, an American Catholic 
priest, to help families in need. They have 
strived to establish Councils of Catholic faith 
for service of charity and goodwill throughout 
American communities and abroad.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF COLONEL 
STEPHEN GOURLEY 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and accomplishments of 
Colonel Stephen Gourley and congratulate 
him on his upcoming retirement. He took the 
values from his years of service and cultivated 
a post-service career that made lasting im-
pacts in our community by educating, advo-
cating, and supporting veterans and their fami-
lies. 
Prior to Colonel Gourley’s contributions to 
our community, he served our nation with 
honor as a 26-year veteran of the United 
States Air Force. Throughout his service, he 
worked on projects in space acquisition and 
operations—commanding teams and space 
systems of the highest national importance. 
Upon retirement from active duty, Colonel 
Gourley came to Colorado and began working 
on behalf of veterans and furthering youth 
STEM education. After years of service as an 
active member of the Air Force Association— 
where he led the development and implemen-
tation of StellarXplorers—Colonel Gourley was 
appointed to serve as the Chair of the Aurora 
Defense Council. Colonel Gourley worked dili-
gently to ensure the Council continued oper-
ating throughout the pandemic—conducting 
virtual meetings focused on strengthening mili-
tary healthcare, promoting the aerospace in-
dustry, establishing the Aurora Armed Forces 
Treatment 
Court, 
recognizing 
those 
who 
served during the pandemic, and supporting 
the people and missions of the U.S. Military. 
Colonel Gourley’s contributions to our coun-
try and community epitomize what it means to 
practice servant leadership. I congratulate 
Colonel Gourley on his retirement and thank 
him for his service to our community and Na-
tion.

STEVE PENLAND 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding service of Steve 
Penland. Steve has spent most of his life as 
a Christmas tree farmer in York, South Caro-
lina and is a dedicated and compassionate 
member of our community. 
Steve is a true friend of the public, having 
served his community and our state for over 
fifty years. In his career as a preeminent 
Christmas tree farmer in South Carolina and a 
leader of the South Carolina Christmas Tree 
Association (SCCTA), Steve has exceeded ex-
pectations in service to our state, which is 
highlighted by his organizing of the annual 
placement of Christmas trees in the Gov-
ernor’s 
mansion. 
Additionally, 
Steve 
has 
served as President of the SCCTA numerous 
times, is a regular participant in the South 
Carolina State Fair, and was a pioneer in en-
hancing Virginia Pine seedlings. Steve re-
mains involved in his community today. 
While Steve has officially retired, his legacy 
continues to be felt throughout our state with 
the success of South Carolina’s Christmas

RECOGNIZING 
SENIOR 
CAPTAIN 
MIKE GREEN FOR 46 YEARS OF 
SERVICE WITH THE BEAVER IS-
LAND BOAT COMPANY 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize Senior Captain Mike Green 
for 46 years of service to his community with 
his work with the Beaver Island Boat Com-
pany. Through his steadfast commitment to 
transporting the public safely and consistently 
across Lake Michigan, he has become an in-
dispensable part of Northern Michigan. 
Mike began his career with the Beaver Is-
land Boat Company (BIBC) as a deckhand in 
1975 when he was only 18 years old. He 
started out alongside his father before eventu-
ally taking over the helm himself—a role he 
has held for 46 years since. Mike’s work has 
been critical for Northern Michigan over the 
years in facilitating travel to and from Beaver 
Island for goods, services, and visitors. BIBC 
operates nine months out of the year, and 
Mike himself runs over 150 trips annually to 
ensure customers and cargo make it safely to 
their destination. 
For nearly half a century, Mike has served 
the public and our community with kindness, 
professionalism, and compassion. We will 
miss him at the helm, but we are excited 
about what his next voyage will be. The exam-
ple he set as Senior Captain of the Beaver Is-
land Boat Company inspires us all and will 
continue to do so for future successors of the 
position. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to congratu-
late Senior Captain Mike Green on his career. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such a driven 
leader. On behalf of my constituents, I wish 
Mike all the best in his future endeavors.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF ADOLFO PETER ‘‘SGAMBY’’ 
SGAMBELLURI 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 18, 2022 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Adolfo 
Peter ‘‘Sgamby’’ Sgambelluri. ‘‘Sgamby,’’ as 
he was widely known, was a retired U.S. Ma-
rine Corps Colonel and dedicated public serv-
ant. Our community will fondly remember him 
as a civic leader unconditionally devoted to 
the people of Guam and our Nation. 
As 
a 
young 
son 
of 
Guam, 
Colonel 
Sgambelluri survived the atrocities of World 
War II and endured through the Japanese oc-
cupation of our island. Emboldened by the he-
roic deeds of his father, who courageously 
worked as a secret intelligence operative dur-
ing the war, and the role of American forces 
in Guam’s liberation, Colonel Sgambelluri rose 
as a resolute defender of the CHamoru peo-
ple. 
After earning his undergraduate degree from 
Washington State University in 1960, Colonel 
Sgambelluri was commissioned in the U.S.

Marine Corps and went on to complete numer-
ous national levels of law enforcement training 
at institutions such as the Military Intelligence 
School, 
the 
FBI 
National 
Academy 
in 
Quantico, Virginia, and the National Intel-
ligence Academy for Law Enforcement, before 
completing his MBA at Pepperdine University 
in 1975. Climbing his way through the ranks, 
he eventually reached the distinguished posi-
tion of colonel and, along this path, became 
one of the very first CHamoru lieutenant colo-
nels in the Marines. Over the course of his 
military career, Colonel Sgambelluri served in 
many roles which included an assignment as 
a UCMJ Article 32 and JAG Investigator, des-
ignation as Officer In-Charge of the Camp 
Pendleton Criminal Investigation Division, and 
appointment as Director of Law Enforcement, 
wherein he practiced worldwide administrative 
control of the entire U.S. Marine Corps Law 
Enforcement and Corrections Program. With 
recognitions such as the Outstanding Execu-
tive Manager Award for American Law En-
forcement Professionals, Police Distinguished 
Service Medal, Bronze Star Medal with ‘‘V’’ 
device for Valor, and Legion of Merit Medal for 
outstanding leadership, Colonel Sgambelluri 
demonstrated a notable capacity for excel-
lence. 
While Colonel Sgambelluri’s chapter as an 
active-duty Marine came to a close after 26 
honorable years of military service, this Viet-
nam War veteran’s commitment to the safety 
of our community was unyielding. His excep-
tional leadership, wisdom, and expertise ex-
tended to his civilian career through pres-
tigious roles such as the Chief of Police of the 
Guam Police Department, Director of the 
Guam Department of Corrections, Vice Presi-
dent of Special Projects, Director of Basic Law 
Enforcement Academy, and Chairman of the 
Board for the Guam Community College, and 
U.S. Federal Security Director for the Trans-
portation Security Administration. In addition to 
his service through these critical positions, 
Colonel Sgambelluri also contributed greatly to 
our community by establishing his private in-
vestigations and security agency, Guam Inves-
tigations Agency Inc., and offering valuable in-
sight into community-wide conversations on 
important issues that involved veterans, public 
safety, and military affairs. 
Colonel Sgambelluri is an icon of public 
safety, dear friend to many, and esteemed ad-
vocate for veterans, whose life’s work illus-
trates an unequivocal dedication to others 
above and before self I join the people of 
Guam in remembering and celebrating his life 
and the legacy of living true to the credo of 
the Marine Corps, Semper Fidelis, he leaves 
behind. I extend my deepest condolences to 
his wife, Rosie L.G. Sgambelluri, their chil-
dren, Michelle, Ana, Adolfo, and Chiara, and 
their spouses and grandchildren. He will be 
deeply missed, and his love and memories will 
forever remain in the hearts of the people of 
Guam.
