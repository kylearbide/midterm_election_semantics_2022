PLIGHT OF THE PEOPLE OF 
PAKISTAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Crying, vom-
iting, and 8 months pregnant, the 
young woman walked for an hour in 
labor pains in search of an ambulance. 
She was 23 years old. 
Her journey did not end with that. 
She finally got to a place where she 
found a taxi. She had to convince this 
taxi driver in the midst of confusion, 
desperation, lack of food, to take her— 
12 hours in labor—to a place where she 
could deliver her baby. 
That is the plight of almost 650,000 
women in Pakistan, where the flood 
waters are monstrosities that you 
would not imagine. 
In visiting Pakistan over the last 10 
days with the Congressional Pakistan 
Caucus, I could see water as far as the 
eye could see. The devastation is over-
whelming: 33 million people displaced, 
more than 600,000 homeless, but more 
than that, hungry. 
I continue to thank the Biden admin-
istration for its initial support of the 
U.N. fund of $30 million and the addi-
tional funding of $20 million. After our 
briefing in Islamabad and working with 
the administration, the United States 
military joined in in delivering 300,000 
tents. 
To my colleagues, more is needed. I 
will be introducing legislation that re-
flects the delegation’s work and, as 
well, their efforts; and that is, we need 
additional 
funding 
for 
these 
dev-
astating conditions. 
We have to realize, as I visited the 
people in Dadu, children are without 
schools, pregnant women are without 
medical care, and as I indicated, more 
and more women will be giving birth 
over the next 6 weeks. This can turn 
into a medical crisis. 
The water is not moving, primarily 
because this water is without a place 
to drain. There are no drainage facili-
ties, if you will, in that area. So we 
will also have water-borne diseases, 
like hepatitis, dengue fever, malaria. 
The people of Pakistan need our help. 
The Pakistani Americans have risen to 
their call. So many in my Congres-
sional district are providing and offer-
ing to help send medical care, if you 
will. Doctors are leaving various places 
in America to head in that direction. 
But it is very important for the United 
States Congress to go on record in rec-
ognizing the devastation that the peo-
ple are facing every single day. 
Would you imagine, even in the trials 
and tribulations that we have in the 
United States, that you have popu-
lations of people who are isolated by 
dirty water and that there are people 
who are living in the outlying areas 
with no shelter whatsoever. The people 
are hungry, the lack of food is rising. 
The pregnant women are fearful for the 
unbelievable challenges they have in 
giving birth. 
Madam Speaker, I am calling upon 
Congress, as I introduce this legisla-
tion dealing with the devastation of 
the floods in Pakistan, to join me in 
supporting the legislation and, as well, 
recognizing the dire conditions that 
our friends in Pakistan are having. 
Our final point is to be reminded that 
Pakistan has been a friend and has 
helped us in the evacuation of Afghan 
refugees; helped us in the war on ter-
ror, where they lost Pakistani military 
in the war on terror. And, of course, 
the huge and very engaging Pakistani 
diaspora, Pakistani Americans who are 
both respected and, of course, energized 
to be collaborative with their govern-
ment here in the United States to try 
to save the lives of babies and children, 
women and men, people who are sick, 
who need kidney transplants, who 
can’t get their medicine, it is impera-
tive that we rise up to this occasion. 
Let me thank the members of the 
Pakistan Caucus who joined us, Mr. 
SUOZZI and Mr. GREEN. We are grateful 
for all of our members who have been 
so energetic in advocating for strong 
Pakistan-U.S. relations. 
I also recognize the USAID, the em-
bassy staff, and of course, the Presi-
dent and Prime Minister, and other 
leaders of government who opened 
their doors in the midst of this crisis 
for us to be briefed and to see the ongo-
ing devastation that is going on there. 
Madam Speaker, I will come back to 
the floor again because I am in fear of 
the devastation of pregnant women 
being stranded in places around that 
region who cannot be reached.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7788 
September 14, 2022 
This 23-year-old traveled 12 hours, 
out of her mind, if you will, to get to a 
place. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me. 
f 
TRANSPARENCY IS 
NONNEGOTIABLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the 
American people are rightfully con-
cerned about the ambiguity of the 
Biden Administration’s ongoing nego-
tiations with Iran. 
Are these negotiations being con-
ducted in good faith? What concessions 
are being made? How would this deal 
impact America’s standing within the 
international community and our ally, 
Israel? 
These are precisely the questions 
that are being asked, and yet, the only 
response coming from the administra-
tion is the sound of crickets chirping. 
The same can be said for Congress. 
The Biden administration has al-
ready expressed its intent to keep Con-
gress in the dark about this potential 
nuclear deal. And according to new re-
porting, the Biden administration is 
trying to hide the facts on their ongo-
ing negotiations with Iran until after 
the midterm elections to avoid scru-
tiny. 
Here is the thing, Madam Speaker, 
the administration is already required 
to submit information to Congress pur-
suant to the Iran Nuclear Agreement 
Review Act or INARA. 
INARA requires that the administra-
tion keep Congress fully and currently 
informed of any new or amended agree-
ment with Iran. Those words couldn’t 
be any clearer. 
In 2015, many Members on the oppo-
site side of the aisle voted for INARA, 
and yet, we have heard nothing but 
crickets from them about holding this 
administration accountable. 
If INARA had not passed 7 years ago, 
Congress could have found itself com-
pletely 
blind 
to 
former 
President 
Obama’s deal with Iran at the time. 
Madam Speaker, 400 Members of the 
House, along with 98 senators voted to 
force President Obama to submit his 
deal to Congress for Congressional re-
view. Given the profound silence as of 
late on these ongoing negotiations, are 
we to believe that good governance and 
effective oversight are no longer tenets 
of this body? 
Madam Speaker, we cannot let ac-
countability and transparency become 
relics of a bygone era. That is why I 
have introduced H. Res. 1266 alongside 
my colleague from South Carolina, 
Representative JOE WILSON. 
This resolution of inquiry requests 
that President Biden turn over to the 
House copies of documents, memos, 
and other communications related to 
any initiative or negotiations regard-
ing Iran’s nuclear program. 
It could also expose any side agree-
ments—such as the episode of the 
Obama administration leaving cash on 
a tarmac in 2016—that are offered as 
part of negotiations with Iran. 
Today, the House Committee on For-
eign Affairs will be marking up my leg-
islation, and the American people will 
find out who still supports increased 
transparency and oversight and who 
does not. 
Congress must do its job and exercise 
its explicit oversight authorities to 
hold this administration accountable. 
If this body upheld its commitment to 
good governance and effective over-
sight 7 years ago, we should certainly 
do the same now. There is no excuse 
not to. 
Congress should not be sitting back 
and kicking its feet up while there is 
work to be done. 
f 
LOWERING COSTS TO AMERICAN 
FAMILIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. GARCIA) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the recent 
passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. 
My fellow colleagues, yesterday, I 
joined many of my House Democrats 
alongside Democratic President Biden 
as we celebrated the passage of this 
new law at the White House. 
During the White House visit, I kept 
thinking of the millions of Americans 
this monumental law will help. I also 
kept thinking about the Texans and 
constituents across my district who 
will benefit significantly from the im-
pact of this law. The Inflation Reduc-
tion Act will lower families’ costs with 
savings ranging from healthcare to en-
ergy costs. But if we look closely, we 
see just how important and lifesaving 
this law is. This law lowers prescrip-
tion drug prices, like insulin, which is 
critical, by finally giving Medicare the 
ability to negotiate prices of prescrip-
tion drugs—not just simply accept 
what Big Pharma says but negotiate 
prices. 
It also prevents greedy price hikes 
and caps out-of-pocket costs to $2,000 
to Medicare beneficiaries—capping out- 
of-pocket at $2,000. 
Madam Speaker, for residents like 
those in my district, Texas’ 29th Dis-
trict, these savings can literally save 
lives. 
My district is 77 percent Latino. 
Studies from the CDC show that 
Latinos are 70 percent more likely than 
white non-Hispanics to be diagnosed 
with diabetes, and they are 1.3 times 
more likely to die from diabetes com-
plications. On top of this, about 11 per-
cent of Texans have diabetes. 
Shockingly, studies show that one in 
four diabetics in Texas have rationed 
their insulin to make ends meet. They 
are literally putting themselves at risk 
of death and more complications be-
cause of the price of insulin. 
Let’s just let that sink in, Madam 
Speaker. One in four diabetics ration a 
lifesaving drug simply because the 
prices are high and because our coun-
try has higher prescription drug prices 
than any other developed country in 
the world. 
This simply breaks my heart. It is 
tough to think about this because this 
issue also does hit very close to home. 
I know all too well people who have 
family members that are suffering 
from diabetes. I know their pain, and I 
know how it impacts their livelihoods 
and their pocketbooks. 
My mother faced uphill battles with 
diabetes before passing away from 
complications due to diabetes. 
b 1015 
Now, I am 1 of 10 children. Five of us 
are also affected by diabetes and are on 
insulin, and a brother is on dialysis. 
So, I know firsthand how important in-
sulin is to one’s health, and I can’t 
fathom a country where people can’t 
afford this lifesaving drug. 
While more must be done for those 
diabetic patients not on Medicare, this 
law is a monumental, great step for-
ward in making insulin accessible to 
all. But I promise to keep fighting for 
those who are not on Medicare, those 
who are not insured, and those who are 
too poor to get access to insulin. 
The Inflation Reduction Act also re-
duces the cost of health insurance for 
millions by extending the Affordable 
Care Act subsidies for 3 more years. 
This will lock in lower healthcare 
prices that will save 13 million people 
across our country an average of $800. 
Now, $800 may not sound like a lot to 
some people, but in my district and 
across America, hardworking families 
know the value of $800. In my district, 
Madam Speaker, there are about 55,000 
people who are enrolled in health in-
surance plans through the Affordable 
Care Act. That is about $800 for these 
Texas families to use for school sup-
plies, for food, for gas, and for other 
basic necessities. 
So, the passage of the Inflation Re-
duction Act is a massive victory for 
the people in my district and districts 
across America. 
This is what happens when we have 
strong leadership in the White House 
and when House Democrats work to-
gether, because they put people first. 
Madam Speaker, it is all about put-
ting people first.

CONNECTIVITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Dakota (Mr. JOHNSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, earlier this year, my 
friend Mark Shlanta died at age 57. He 
had been a South Dakota telecommuni-
cations leader since 1998. 
Earlier this year, my friend Greg 
Dean died at age 58. He had been a 
South 
Dakota 
telecommunications 
leader since 1999. 
Earlier this year, my friend Rod 
Bowar died at age 60. He had been a

September 14, 2022 
South 
Dakota 
telecommunications 
leader since 1976. 
Earlier this year, my friend Bryan 
Roth died at age 59. He had been a 
South 
Dakota 
telecommunications 
leader since 1998. 
Now, losing one friend, losing one in-
dustry leader, is not easy. When you 
lose four over the past few months, it 
can be almost more than their friends 
and family can bear. 
These were real leaders. Everybody 
around here talks about broadband. It 
has been a hot topic in Congress for the 
last 2 years, every day—broadband, 
high-speed 
internet, 
broadband, 
connectivity. 
But I tell you, Madam Speaker, those 
four 
gentlemen 
were 
involved 
in 
broadband long before it was cool and 
long before it was the hot topic in 
Washington, D.C. 
Mark spent 20 years as the CEO of 
SDN. Originally, it was the South Da-
kota Network. He turned this into one 
of the most sophisticated State net-
works in the country, and he expanded 
it by 50,000 miles of fiber-optic cable. 
For 20 years, Greg, in his work with 
the South Dakota Telecommunications 
Act, was probably the most influential 
person to help set rural broadband pol-
icy in the halls of the State capital. 
For 30 or 40 years, Rod, in his work as 
the CEO of Kennebec Telephone Com-
pany, made sure that two small towns, 
Kennebec with 281 residents and Presho 
with 472, had high-speed internet that 
would be the envy of the largest and 
most cosmopolitan urban areas in the 
world. 
For more than 20 years as CEO of 
TrioTel, Bryan worked to make sure 
that that cooperative was the first 
telephone company in South Dakota, 
all the way back in 2013, to have 100 
percent of its customers connected 
with fiber. 
So, yes, Madam Speaker, these were 
titans of the rural broadband arena. 
But when I think about connectivity 
and these gentlemen’s contribution to 
it, I don’t just think about rural 
broadband. I think about the connec-
tions they made with their families 
and their communities. It would have 
been hard to do more for Sioux Falls or 
for Scouting or for his family than 
Mark did. It would have been hard to 
do more for the Pierre community or 
Pierre athletics or his family than 
Greg did. It would have been hard to do 
more for his church or the outdoors or 
the Salem community than Bryan did. 
It would have been hard to do more for 
Kennebec or for Presho or for the fire 
department or for his family than Rod 
did. 
The contributions of these gentlemen 
in their communities were absolutely 
staggering. So, Madam Speaker, it is 
altogether appropriate that we focus 
on 
the 
contributions 
to 
rural 
broadband of these four titans of the 
industry. But I also think it is impor-
tant to recognize that when they 
thought of connectivity and when they 
made a contribution to connectivity, it 
was about the human connection. 
No one could have done more for the 
people and the places they loved than 
Mark, Greg, Rod, and Bryan did.

COMMEMORATING THE LEGACIES 
OF ADDIE MAE COLLINS, DENISE 
MCNAIR, 
CAROLE 
ROBERTSON, 
AND CYNTHIA MORRIS WESLEY 
ON THE 59TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE 
16TH 
STREET 
BAPTIST 
CHURCH BOMBING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Alabama (Ms. SEWELL) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the lives and 
legacies of four precious little girls— 
Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Car-
ole Robertson, and Cynthia Morris 
Wesley—who died within the sacred 
walls of the 16th Street Baptist Church 
in Birmingham, Alabama, 59 years ago. 
On September 15, 1963, as the four lit-
tle girls were getting dressed in the 
bathroom of the church basement, pre-
paring to sing in the choir, 19 sticks of 
dynamite placed under the church det-
onated and totally exploded, causing 
the interior walls to actually cave in. 
The crowd of about 200 people who 
gathered for the 11 a.m. service evacu-
ated the church. But the church was 
filled with smoke, and underneath the 
debris lie four little girls. 
Along with the little girls who lost 
their lives, dozens of others were in-
jured that day, including Sarah Collins 
Rudolph, the younger sister of Addie 
Mae Collins, who was in the basement 
with her sister and the other girls pre-
paring for church that day. 
Due to the violently racist nature of 
the attack, thousands of African Amer-
icans protested across the State of Ala-
bama. In response, George Wallace 
called the police to break up the dem-
onstrations. 
The violent clashes between pro-
testers and police resulted in massive 
arrests and the tragic loss of two more 
lives, two little boys who died that 
day, Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware. 
The two boys, one 16 and the other 13, 
were killed within hours of the church 
bombing. 
Following the attack, several people, 
many of whom were members of the 
KKK, were arrested, but none of them— 
none of them—were actually pros-
ecuted until 34 years later. 
Described by Dr. Martin Luther King 
as one of the most vicious and tragic 
crimes ever perpetrated against hu-
manity, this racially motivated act of 
terrorism focused America’s eyes on 
Birmingham, Alabama, bringing into 
sharp 
clarity 
the 
injustices 
that 
sparked the civil rights movement. 
Although we will never replace the 
lives lost or injuries suffered, the pas-
sage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965 proved 
that their sacrifices were not in vain. 
Today, as we reflect on our painful 
history, we are reminded that every 
gain in the battle for civil rights has 
come at a high cost paid by those who 
sacrificed everything for a vision and a 
dream bigger than themselves. 
As a direct beneficiary of the legacy 
of the four little girls, I was honored 
that the very first bill that I passed in 
this body posthumously bestowed upon 
them the Congressional Gold Medal to 
ensure that this Nation will never for-
get their sacrifice. 
I not only question where I would be 
today without the influence of the four 
little girls, but more importantly, I 
question 
where 
America 
would 
be 
today. The premature and senseless 
deaths of these four little girls awak-
ened the slumbering conscience of 
America and galvanized the civil rights 
movement. 
It was their memory that carried 
John Lewis and those brave foot sol-
diers, unarmed and unafraid, across the 
Edmund Pettus Bridge in my home-
town of Selma, Alabama. 
It was their sacrifice which burned in 
the mind of President Lyndon Johnson 
as he signed the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
It was their sacrifice that inspired a 
generation of freedom fighters to move 
this Nation closer to its highest ideals 
of equality and justice for all. 
Madam Speaker, as we commemorate 
the 59th year since the bombing of the 
16th Street Baptist Church, we, as 
Americans, are called upon to reflect 
on the legacy of the four little girls 
and to know them by name: Addie Mae 
Collins, 
Carole 
Robertson, 
Denise 
McNair, and Cynthia Morris Wesley. 
These four little girls and the loss of 
their lives have changed America for-
ever. 
The legacy of the four little girls 
paved the way for a more equitable and 
more just future. For that, we owe it to 
them to pick up the baton and carry it 
forward. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in commemorating the 59th 
anniversary of the lives of Addie Mae 
Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robert-
son, and Cynthia Morris Wesley. 
May 
we 
always 
remember 
their 
names: Addie Mae, Denise, Carole, and 
Cynthia.

REMEMBERING SANDRA DEAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in memory of 
Sandra Deal, a woman whose legacy as 
a lifelong champion of education will 
not soon be forgotten. 
On August 23, Mrs. Deal passed away 
surrounded by family after a 4-year 
battle with cancer. Sandra was the 
daughter of two educators and was 
raised in Gainesville, Georgia. After 
earning both a bachelor’s degree and a 
master’s degree in elementary edu-
cation, she went on to teach language 
arts in public schools for over 15 years. 
As Georgia’s first lady, she made 
childhood literacy improvements her 
top priority. Through this initiative,

she visited schools in every single one 
of Georgia’s 159 counties, spanning 
across 180 school districts. Across just 
8 years, she read to students in nearly 
1,000 classrooms, touching tens of thou-
sands of lives. She donated copies of 
her memoir, ‘‘Memories of the Man-
sion: The Story of Georgia’s Governor’s 
Mansion,’’ to every public library in 
the State. 
On top of these accomplishments, she 
was a devoted wife of 56 years, a moth-
er to four, and a grandmother to six. A 
shining example of the qualities every 
person strives toward, Sandra Deal’s 
impact will be felt by many genera-
tions of Georgians. 
HONORING LIEUTENANT GENERAL DONALD E. 
‘‘ROSIE’’ ROSENBLUM 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, it is with a very heavy heart 
that I rise today to recognize and 
honor the life and service of a true 
American patriot in my district, Lieu-
tenant General Donald E. Rosenblum. 
Rosie was born on June 3, 1929, in 
Flushing, New York, and was raised 
during the Depression in Hell’s Kitchen 
in New York. 
In 1948, Rosie graduated high school 
and followed his older brother, Bob, to 
the Citadel in Charleston, South Caro-
lina. At the Citadel, Rosie was a mem-
ber of the varsity baseball team and 
sports editor of the college paper. Upon 
graduation, Rosie was commissioned as 
a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army 
and deployed to lead an infantry pla-
toon in the Korean war. 
After Korea, Rosie was placed in 
command of an infantry company in 
the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort 
Bragg and served as a staff officer in 
Berlin, Germany, when the wall was 
built. 
In between his tours in Vietnam, 
Rosie also managed to graduate from 
the U.S. Army War College and later 
served as the executive officer to the 
Army’s director of operations at the 
Pentagon. It was there that he received 
his first of three general officer stars, 
and he was then transferred to Fort 
Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield in 
Georgia. 
Rosie became an institution in our 
community, serving on boards for the 
YMCA of Coastal Georgia, the Vietnam 
Veterans’ Memorial Savannah, and the 
Citadel Foundation. 
His legacy is one of patriotism, dedi-
cation, selflessness, and love for his 
neighbors. My prayers reside with his 
family and friends during this time of 
sadness. 
HONORING THE FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH IN PORT 
WENTWORTH 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the First 
Baptist Church of Port Wentworth and 
its 100-year anniversary. 
Under the leadership of Reverend 
L.R. Watkins, the First Baptist Church 
in Port Wentworth has been a shining 
cornerstone of greater Savannah since 
its founding in 1922. 
In the early 1950s, the church decided 
to purchase and install chimes within 
the church steeple so that all within 
the community could hear the ‘‘call to 
worship’’ bells every Sunday morning. 
These bells became popular within the 
Port Wentworth community. 
During the 1960s and 1970s, the church 
experienced tremendous growth. As the 
church grew larger, there was a need 
for an educational building for the 
church’s youth. In 1960, a new edu-
cational wing of the church was dedi-
cated. The 1970s also brought even 
more new changes to the church. The 
church expanded its music program 
and decided to build a new sanctuary. 
The sanctuary that was dedicated in 
1973 is still being used today. 
Today, the First Baptist Church in 
Port Wentworth is under the leadership 
of Reverend Paul Mongin. Reverend 
Mongin is continuing the legacy of the 
congregation’s storied history. 
Congratulations 
Port 
Wentworth 
First Baptist Church on this wonderful 
milestone.

IN LOVING MEMORY OF TERRELL COPPAGE 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in loving memory 
of a devoted husband, a caring father, 
and 
my 
wonderful 
father-in-law, 
Terrell Coppage. 
On April 28, 1928, Terrell was born in 
Lowndes County, Georgia. His family 
migrated to Adel, Georgia, and Terrell 
attended Sparks-Adel High School. 
Immediately 
after 
high 
school, 
Terrell joined the war effort, serving as 
a member of the United States Navy 
during World War II. 
On August 21, 1949, Terrell met Betty 
Jones, his future wife of 73 years. 
As a member of his community, 
Terrell was among the best. He was ac-
tively involved in his church, Trinity 
United Methodist Church, leading Sun-
day school and the local Boy Scout 
Troop 306 for many years. He spoke 
fondly of his trip with the Boy Scout 
troop to the National Boy Scout Jam-
boree in Washington, D.C. in 1981. 
Terrell was also a member of the 
Okefenokee Lions Club, and was chosen 
as ‘‘Lion of the Year,’’ as well as serv-
ing as house captain for many years 
during their ‘‘Christmas in April’’ 
event. 
Keenager Choir, traveling to all 50 
States, and daily walks with the ‘‘mall 
walkers’’ that ended with McDonald’s 
biscuits were just some of the small 
joys that Terrell and Betty shared to-
gether. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Terrell for 
all that he did to raise my wife, Amy, 
and for being the best father-in-law and 
grandfather anyone could ask for. We 
love you, and we will miss you.

MEDALS FOR WORLD WAR II VET-
ERAN BERNARD E. STRICKLAND, 
M.D. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. BARRAGA´ N) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Dr. Bernard E. 
Strickland, a constituent, a veteran, 
and a doctor. This is a long overdue 
recognition that he deserves for his 
contributions to our country and to 
our community. 
Born on January 21, 1922, Dr. Strick-
land served courageously in the U.S. 
military during World War II from 1943 
to 1946. During his service, he led a 
squadron of soldiers as a sergeant in 
the historic 761st Tank Battalion. 
Known as Patton’s Panthers, they were 
the first African-American tank squad 
to see combat in Europe. They were 
not permitted to serve alongside White 
troops, and they were the ones who 
went 
in 
to 
liberate 
concentration 
camps. 
Dr. Strickland and the rest of the 
battalion were crucial to advancing 
freedom 
internationally 
and 
racial 
equality domestically. The 761st Tank 
Battalion also assisted in making sure 
that those that were trapped—Jews 
that were liberated in these concentra-
tion camps—were able to get out. The 
things that he saw were horrific. 
His son, Henry, had reached out to 
my office to let us know about his serv-
ice and about the fact that he had not 
been recognized. 
Today, I am proud to announce that 
Dr. Strickland will receive eight med-
als—eight awards—for his exemplary 
conduct, including the Good Conduct 
Medal; the American Campaign Medal; 
the European-African-Middle Eastern 
Campaign Medal; the World War II Vic-
tory Medal; the Army of Occupation 
Medal with Germany clasp; the Honor-
able Service Lapel Button World War 
II; the Expert Badge with machine gun 
bar; and the Sharpshooter Badge with 
rifle bar. 
Following his honorable discharge, 
he continued to devote his life to help-
ing others as a medical doctor prac-
ticing medicine for more than 25 years 
in California. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Strick-
land for his tireless dedication to his 
country and to our community.

INFLATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, the 
American people are facing persistent 
pain in their wallets and pocketbooks, 
with inflation in August hitting 8.3 
percent, higher than expectations. 
But yesterday, hours after new infla-
tion figures revealed that price hikes 
are continuing to burden hardworking 
Americans, President Biden held an 
event to celebrate the signing of the 
deceptively-named Inflation Reduction 
Act into law, touting the radical legis-
lation as a victorious success. 
The Inflation Expansion Act a suc-
cess? Not quite. Not even close. 
Grocery costs have surged nearly 14 
percent, gas rose more than 33 percent, 
electricity costs have increased nearly

16 percent, rent almost 7 percent, and 
transportation has soared 11 percent. 
Republicans warned that burning 
through billions of dollars in order to 
expand the IRS by 87,000 new agents, 
advance Green New Deal initiatives, 
and deliver crushing tax hikes would 
only plunge our economy into deeper 
turmoil—worsening inflation and con-
tributing to our ballooning national 
debt. 
Yet, Speaker PELOSI, Senate Leader 
SCHUMER, and President Biden steam-
rolled ahead anyway—selfishly advanc-
ing their Big Government Socialist 
agenda that costs the American people 
over 1 month’s pay every year. Yes, 
Americans are now losing a month’s 
pay every year because of Biden infla-
tion. 
Enough is enough. Americans simply 
cannot afford the cost of one-party 
Democrat rule in Washington any 
longer. We must prioritize financial se-
curity and fiscal responsibility over 
runaway spending and reckless mone-
tary policies in order to provide Amer-
ican workers, families, and small busi-
nesses, the economic relief they des-
perately need. 
BORDER CRISIS 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the raging crisis 
that continues to plague our southern 
border. 
Since President Biden stepped foot 
into the Oval Office, his failed policies 
and radical open border agenda have 
provoked 
an 
unprecedented 
illegal 
alien invasion at our southern border. 
While Vice President KAMALA HAR-
RIS, our so-called ‘‘Border Czar,’’ comi-
cally claims that the southern border 
is secure, the American people know 
good and well that this is a blatant 
falsehood. But unlike our delusional 
Border Czar, the numbers don’t lie. 
Nearly 5 million illegal aliens have 
crossed 
the 
southern 
border 
since 
Biden and HARRIS took office. To make 
matters worse, 66 individuals on the 
Terrorist 
Screening 
Database 
have 
been stopped trying to illegally enter 
our country—this is more than double 
the last 5 years combined—double the 
last 5 years combined. 
Furthermore, U.S. Customs and Bor-
der 
Protection 
has 
seized 
enough 
fentanyl in this fiscal year alone to kill 
almost 2.4 billion people—over seven 
times the U.S. population. 
The southern border is, in fact, not 
secure, and the Biden administration 
knows it. After all, chaotic open bor-
ders have always been their plan. Un-
less the Biden administration abandons 
this 
sinister 
scheme, 
communities 
across the country will only continue 
to be ravaged by deadly drugs and bor-
der lawlessness. 
It is simple: Americans deserve bor-
der security, not an administration ac-
tively manufacturing mayhem, advo-
cating 
for 
mass 
amnesty, 
and 
emboldening dangerous cartels. 
President Biden must immediately 
about-face on his open border agenda, 
commit to securing our southern bor-
der, and finally put American people 
first. 
USDA LETTER 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to strongly oppose the Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s poultry line 
speed waiver rule. 
Back in July, over 50 chicken plants 
that currently participate in the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture’s waiver 
program received a notification from 
the Department stating that within 1 
month these plants must participate in 
a third-party study in order to retain 
their line speed waivers. 
In addition to granting a third-party 
group unlimited and unannounced ac-
cess to poultry plants, the study also 
requires these plants to submit heaps 
of data and burdensome paperwork. 
Failure to participate in this study re-
sults in chicken plants slowing produc-
tion by 25 percent, creating supply 
chain mayhem in the industry, and un-
deniably posing a serious threat to food 
availability. 
The 
Biden 
administration’s 
line 
speed waiver rule forces an ultimatum 
on poultry plants, burdening both con-
sumers and workers already battling 
supply chain disruptions and hyper-
inflation, for the sake of a vague, in-
trusive, and unnecessary third-party 
study on worker safety. 
Since I represent and serve the 
‘‘Poultry 
Capital 
of 
the 
World,’’ 
Gainesville, Georgia, I proudly led 34 of 
my colleagues in sending a letter to 
USDA Secretary Vilsack expressing 
grave concerns about the third-party 
study and urging the delay in the man-
date. 
Given the adverse effects this rule 
imposes on the industry and poultry 
production, Secretary Vilsack must 
immediately provide substantive an-
swers to Congress about why this rule 
must be put in place. 
Madam Speaker, I am fully com-
mitted to conducting proper congres-
sional oversight into the USDA’s line 
speed waiver so that we can continue 
to run at full capacity. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the Vice 
President.

300 DAYS SINCE WE SIGNED THE 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENT 
AND JOBS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today as this week marks 300 
days since we signed the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act into law. 
But we didn’t stop there, we have ac-
complished so much more in the last 
100 days. 
For years, Washington has been all 
talk, no action when it comes to infra-
structure. 
Congress 
after 
Congress, 
President after President, all promised 
to finally tackle our Nation’s crum-
bling infrastructure. This Congress fi-
nally delivered—and delivered with bi-
partisan support. 
It was truly a historic moment, but 
in the 300 days since it was signed into 
law—on this very floor, amidst all of 
the noise and divisiveness—this Con-
gress has continued to make history. 
The Bipartisan Safer Communities 
Act, the most significant gun violence 
legislation in nearly 30 years. Now law. 
The PACT Act, to provide genera-
tions of veterans and their families the 
care and benefits they have earned and 
deserve. Now law. 
The CHIPS and Science Act, which 
will allow us to compete with China, 
boost our supply chains and American 
innovation, and bring jobs back to 
America. Now law. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, the big-
gest step our country has taken to 
tackle climate change, while also de-
livering lower prices for prescription 
drugs and expanded access to afford-
able healthcare. This, too, is now law. 
Nevada was ground zero for the eco-
nomic devastation of this pandemic. 
Nevada was also ground zero for the 
most urgent effects of climate change, 
but Nevada also stands to gain the 
most from the Inflation Reduction Act. 
A record 14.5 million people—and more 
than 100,000 Nevadans—have signed up 
for coverage through the ACA market-
places. Now, that coverage will be even 
more affordable with the expanded tax 
credits in the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Medicare can finally negotiate lower 
drug prices, which means savings for 
our seniors and every single taxpayer. 
Not only that, the Inflation Reduction 
Act caps out-of-pocket costs for part D 
drugs and insulin for seniors and indi-
viduals with disabilities on Medicare. 
All of this means better, more acces-
sible healthcare, and more money in 
Nevadans’ pockets. I am also incredibly 
proud that this bill will tackle our cli-
mate crisis and stand up for Nevada’s 
future. The West is facing the worst 
drought in 12 centuries. In my district, 
the dire situation at Lake Mead is 
making headlines all over the world. 
This bill will help mitigate the harm-
ful effects of our drought by funding 
environmental restoration projects and 
investing in conservation projects to 
increase water levels in the Colorado 
River. 
It is going to take all of us to fight 
the climate crisis. This bill supports 
Nevadans on the ground in their effort 
to save energy and save money all 
along the way. 
Do you need to replace a stove or a 
refrigerator? Do you need to install 
solar panels or perhaps buy an electric 
vehicle? This bill will help you with di-
rect rebates to buy more energy-effi-
cient options. 
Overall, Nevadan families that take 
advantage of the clean energy tax cred-
its could save more than $20,000 in a 
single year. All of this is fully paid for 
by cuts to our deficit by $300 billion, by 
finally making the ultra-wealthy and 
big corporations finally begin to pay 
their fair share. Let me be clear, not

year will pay a penny more in Federal 
taxes. 
Madam Speaker, a lot can happen 
just in 300 days—from infrastructure to 
gun violence prevention to helping our 
veterans and building a stronger Amer-
ican economy. The Inflation Reduction 
Act is perhaps the biggest achievement 
of this Congress, and House Democrats 
delivered it alone. 
Not one Republican voted to lower 
the cost of prescription drugs and insu-
lin. Not one Republican voted to lower 
healthcare costs. Not one Republican 
voted for a fairer tax system. 
Not one Republican voted to put peo-
ple over their politics. The fight con-
tinues, and House Democrats will do 
everything in our power to deliver the 
results and put the American people 
first.

NATIONAL HISPANIC HERITAGE 
MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today during Hispanic Heritage Month 
to recognize Carolina Padilla and the 
Intercultural Senior Center in my dis-
trict. 
Historically, National Hispanic Her-
itage Month has been a way to appre-
ciate the contributions and influence 
Hispanic Americans have made to our 
history, culture, and achievements of 
the United States. I can think of no 
better way to recognize the achieve-
ments of Hispanic Americans in our 
district than by recognizing Carolina 
and the Intercultural Senior Center, 
which provides language interpreta-
tion, 
cultural 
insight, 
community 
events, as well as social workers, to 
better connect community members 
with outside resources. 
Carolina, who was born in Guatemala 
City, immigrated to Omaha, Nebraska, 
in 1993 with her husband and three chil-
dren. She then started her career in the 
United States by spending 12 years 
working for One World Community 
Health Center, a nonprofit primary 
healthcare facility. During her time at 
One World, she worked in a variety of 
health departments in both adminis-
trative and leadership positions. 
Additionally, she worked for Catholic 
Charities, where she was the director of 
their Latina Resource Center. In this 
role, she worked to develop social serv-
ice programs for women in need of as-
sistance with English as their second 
language, as well as women facing 
issues of domestic violence. 
During this time, Carolina realized 
that one segment of the population, 
the Latino elders, were largely over-
looked and underserved. Inspired by 
her aging family in Guatemala and her 
need to serve others within her own 
community, 
Carolina 
founded 
the 
Intercultural Senior Center in 2009 in 
the Latino neighborhood of South 
Omaha. The Intercultural Senior Cen-
ter, however, has extended much far-
ther than the Latino community as it 
now welcomes refugee communities, 
including 
Sudan, 
Somalia, 
Bhutan, 
Nepal, 
Afghanistan, 
Ukraine, 
and 
Burma, as well as native English 
speakers. 
Today, the Intercultural Senior Cen-
ter is a unique place where seniors find 
enrichment and belonging, regardless 
of language, ethnicity, race, sexual ori-
entation, socioeconomic background, 
and any other differences that too 
often create separation and isolation. 
As Omaha’s population ages and be-
comes more diverse, Ms. Padilla’s mis-
sion and the Intercultural Senior Cen-
ter will continue to embrace the elder-
ly and bring awareness to the commu-
nity about the aging population. 
Congratulations again to Carolina 
Padilla and the Intercultural Senior 
Center on this amazing work you are 
doing within the Omaha community. 
OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today during Ovarian Cancer Aware-
ness Month to recognize women who 
have been diagnosed with ovarian can-
cer who have either survived or, unfor-
tunately, lost their hard-fought battle. 
A rare but deadly disease, only about 
19,880 women will receive a new diag-
nosis this year; but this past March, 
our communications director, Danielle 
Jensen was one of them. 
The deadliest of the reproductive 
cancers, only 20 percent are diagnosed 
early in stages I or II, with a 5-year 
survival rate of over 93 percent. Unfor-
tunately, the majority of cases are di-
agnosed in stages III or IV, and the sur-
vival rate can be as low as 30 percent. 
The risk of a woman getting ovarian 
cancer is about 1 in 78 in her lifetime, 
and it is estimated that 12,810 women 
will lose their lives to ovarian cancer 
this year. Fortunately, Danielle was di-
agnosed at stage II and has recently 
completed chemotherapy. 
There are several factors that can in-
crease the risk of ovarian cancer. Age 
is the biggest one. Half of all ovarian 
cancers are found in women 63 years of 
age and older. Another is if a woman 
has never carried a pregnancy to full 
term or had a child after the age of 35. 
Hormone replacement therapy, a fam-
ily history of ovarian, breast, or 
colorectal cancer, or a personal history 
of breast cancer are also risk factors. 
There is no reliable screening or di-
agnostic test for ovarian cancer, so it 
is important to know the signs and 
symptoms, which includes back pain, 
bloating, frequent urination, feeling 
full quickly after eating, fatigue, upset 
stomach, heartburn, or constipation, 
pelvic or abdominal pain, or changes in 
the menstrual cycle. While these symp-
toms are most likely not signs of can-
cer, they should be of concern if they 
don’t go away after two weeks fol-
lowing normal interventions such as 
changing diet and exercise. It is be-
cause of this that ovarian cancer is 
often referred to as the silent killer. 
There are different treatments for 
ovarian cancer. Danielle had surgery 
and she went through six cycles of 
chemotherapy to kill any cancer cells 
that may have been left. Some women 
will also undergo radiation to treat it. 
Finally, we are just thankful that 
Danielle was diagnosed early when she 
was and is on the path of being a sur-
vivor.

REMEMBERING THE EFFECTS OF 
HURRICANE IDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. BOWMAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BOWMAN. Madam Speaker, 1 
year ago, the remnants of Hurricane 
Ida came through my district, result-
ing in catastrophic damage to our New 
York-16 community. This hurricane 
originated in the Gulf Coast and ar-
rived in New York several days later, 
still so strong and dangerous that it 
led to the tragic death of several neigh-
bors. 
Among those killed were Fran and 
Ken Bailie, who were professors at Iona 
College. I stand here today in their 
memory, and in community with fami-
lies, friends, and neighbors who lost 
loved ones. 
Hurricane Ida brought historic levels 
of 
flooding 
to 
New 
York-16. 
The 
evening the storm hit was scary and 
chaotic. We were not collectively pre-
pared for the amount of rain we re-
ceived, and people watched with shock 
as their homes and neighborhoods 
flooded. At times in the night we got 
tornado warnings, followed by flood 
warnings, and then followed by more 
tornado warnings. This is not an area 
of the country that is used to these 
sorts of hurricanes, and I remember 
feeling terrified and confused as we all 
tried to stay safe. 
In the days that followed, instead of 
a joyful return to New Rochelle High 
School for its students, students found 
themselves with a destroyed, com-
pletely destroyed library. Congregants 
in Bronxville were left with a flooded 
synagogue during Rosh Hashanah. The 
First Baptist Church in Mamaroneck 
was destroyed, and congregants are 
still picking up the pieces. 
I visited constituents’ homes and 
small businesses in Yonkers, Mamaro-
neck, Mount Vernon, Rye, and Pelham, 
and the sense of despair was palpable. 
People could not even travel to check 
in with loved ones because the Saw-
mill, Bronx River Parkway, Hutch, 
Sprain Brook, and Cross County Ex-
pressway were deep underwater. 
Our immigrant neighbors in Mamaro-
neck had to reckon with the damage to 
their community resource center, and 
the Rye YMCA was left completely de-
stroyed. 
For thousands of neighbors, Hurri-
cane Ida fundamentally changed their 
financial well-being and housing sta-
bility. The recovery process and trau-
ma from that storm continues today. 
In the days following, our commu-
nity showed an incredible amount of

resilience. And as I reflect, these mo-
ments of hope and solidarity come to 
the forefront of my mind. First re-
sponders ensured everyone was safe. 
The Rye soccer team, Mamaroneck 
volleyball team, and countless others 
took to the streets to support our 
neighbors. 
Teams like the Mamaroneck Tigers 
volunteered with the Fuller Center for 
Housing of Greater New York City to 
help members of the First Baptist 
Church remove pews that mothers 
would pray on and the hymnal books 
that contained songs of strength and 
power. 
Organizations like the Red Cross and 
Feeding Westchester provided food to 
those in need. The incredible mayors, 
managers, councilmembers, trustees, 
and community leaders in the Bronx, 
Ardsley, 
Bronxville, 
Eastchester, 
Greenburgh, 
Hastings-on-Hudson, 
Larchmont, 
Mamaroneck, 
Mount 
Vernon, 
New 
Rochelle, 
Pelham, 
Pelham Manor, Rye, Scarsdale, and 
Tuckahoe, mobilized emergency re-
sources to keep people safe. 
We worked alongside County Execu-
tive Latimer, Bronx Borough President 
Diaz, Jr., and Governor Hochul to expe-
dite damage assessments. These efforts 
led to President Biden declaring a state 
of emergency in New York and the al-
location of much-needed FEMA re-
sources. From there, we helped con-
stituents with FEMA applications and 
hosted multiple visits with the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers to plan long- 
term recovery. 
Let me be clear: The climate crisis is 
here, and it is real, and I refuse to let 
my district bear the brunt of inaction. 
We have worked to secure flood mitiga-
tion funds, advance flood prevention 
studies in Westchester County, and 
vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, 
which will help make our communities 
resilient and kick-start the clean en-
ergy revolution that we need. But more 
needs to be done. 
As a father and former educator, I 
am deeply concerned about the impact 
that increased flooding will have on 
our children. That is why I introduced 
my Green New Deal for Public Schools 
to ensure our school buildings are resil-
ient and that students can thrive. 
As we mark this anniversary of Hur-
ricane Ida, let’s continue to recommit 
to supporting one another, to healing 
our communities, to confronting the 
climate crisis head on, and to ensuring 
that no one gets left behind.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
LARRY HOFF 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. HERRERA
BEUTLER) 
for 5 minutes. 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to honor and rec-
ognize my friend and fellow Southwest 
Washingtonian and State Representa-
tive Larry Hoff, who is retiring at the 
end of this term. 
Larry has been just an upstanding 
member of Southwest Washington’s 
community for over 40 years. After 
serving in the Navy and graduating 
from college, Larry moved to Van-
couver, where he was an executive in 
the financial services industry before 
successfully running to serve Clark 
County in the 18th Legislative District. 
In Olympia, Larry fought hard to get 
things done for Southwest Washing-
ton’s small businesses, for our farmers, 
families, and our communities. But it 
is really Larry’s heart for serving our 
community that is what stands out to 
all of us who know him. 
Whether it is his role on the board of 
the Doernbecher Children’s Hospital 
Foundation, or the Clark County De-
partment of Community Services, or 
the countless other stories of coming 
alongside his neighbors, Larry’s infec-
tious optimism and selflessness are ap-
parent to all who meet him. 
Thank you, Larry, for your many 
years of service and hard work to make 
our Evergreen State a better place to 
live, work, and raise a family. 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF BRANDON VICK 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to who honor and 
recognize 
Southwest 
Washingtonian 
and 
State 
Representative 
Brandon 
Vick, who is retiring at the end of this 
term. 
Brandon is a lifelong resident of 
Southwest Washington and a rock-solid 
member of our community. In addition 
to serving in the State House of Rep-
resentatives, he also gives his time to 
the Boy Scouts and to the Boys and 
Girls Club. 
In Olympia, Brandon has been a 
champion for his home county, my 
home county, Clark County, for the 
last decade. Under his leadership on 
the Consumer Protection and Small 
Business Committee, 14 bills that he 
wrote and led have been signed into 
law, including recent legislation to

GOVERNMENTAL OVERREACH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. RYAN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States delivered a gut punch to the 
body politic here in the United States 
with the Dobbs decision. This is the 
largest governmental overreach into 
the private lives of American citizens 
in the history of our lifetime. This is 
Big Government coming into our doc-
tors’ offices, coming into our bed-
rooms, a small group of people trying 
to control American citizens, make 
women second-class citizens. And I be-
lieve that the vast majority of the 
American people are absolutely ex-
hausted and want the government out 
of their lives, out of our personal lives. 
Justice Thomas’ opinion about nul-
lifying marriages, about getting rid of 
birth control, is an extreme overreach. 
This is a country built on freedom, and 
it is time for us to stand up; the ex-
hausted majority, Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents, saying we 
want limited government, and we want 
it out of the private lives of American 
citizens, especially the women of the 
United States. 
OPPORTUNITIES IN NATURAL GAS 
Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to talk about a very important 
issue in this country. This country is a 
country that has been and was founded 
on the idea of freedom. This country 
has fed more people, clothed more peo-
ple, cured more people, and liberated 
more people than all the other coun-
tries in the world combined. And the 
source of American power has always 
been the great American middle class 
which we need to have an aggressive 
policy to rebuild. And the strength of 
the American middle class has always 
been connected to our energy policy. 
Do we have a policy in this country 
that will allow us to dominate the 
world in manufacturing, to dominate 
the industries of the future, to keep 
costs low for both business and con-
sumers? 
And so I am rising here today in sup-
port of this permitting process bill that 
we will be voting on here this week. 
b 1100 
This is an important opportunity for 
us to mobilize and move the natural 
gas industry in places like Ohio to both 
reduce costs here for manufacturers 
and consumers and for us to export this 
product abroad to make sure our allies 
in Europe are able to get cheap natural 
gas so that they are not hooked on 
Vladimir Putin. 
There is an opportunity here to sell 
to China, which is putting on one coal- 
fired power plant a week. 
This is both a jobs bill; this is about 
putting money in people’s pockets by 
reducing energy costs; and this is 
about helping our allies abroad. 
The number one country to reduce 
CO2 from 2005 to 2020 was the United 
States of America because natural gas 
replaced coal. If we do that around the 
world, we have an opportunity in the 
next 5 to 10 years to dramatically re-
duce carbon around the world and meet 
some of our climate change goals. 
This permitting bill is acknowl-
edging the fact that the average dura-
tion of some of these projects is 41⁄2 
years to get the permits, and 25 percent 
of these projects take 6 years. If you 
are doing a hydrogen project, 5 years 
and 11 Federal and State agencies. 
You wonder why the average Amer-
ican is so frustrated or the average

businessperson 
is 
so 
frustrated 
to 
interface with the American Govern-
ment. As a business or a consumer, for 
that matter, it is maddening. It is lim-
iting our ability to create jobs here in 
the United States, to power the United 
States, and to meet our climate goals. 
This is a win across the board. 
This permitting bill is for 42 percent 
of the DOE projects or for clean energy 
transmission or conservation. Only 15 
percent is for fossil fuels. But it is all 
gummed up, and we can’t get any 
progress. 
This bill is an opportunity for us to 
provide some framework to streamline 
this process so that we can get moving 
on some of these projects so that we 
can dominate these industries in the 
future. 
In my district, we have two natural 
gas power plants. We need more. We 
want to build electric vehicles, electric 
trucks, electric cars, electric tractors, 
batteries, solar panels. We want to 
move into hydrogen. We have so many 
opportunities in this country, but it is 
gummed up by an old, corroded govern-
ment that doesn’t know how to inter-
face with business. 
I am supportive of this permitting 
bill. I think we need to streamline this 
process. We need to juice up the nat-
ural gas industry, as well as the other 
industries in the future. This is a red, 
white, and blue energy policy and per-
mitting process bill. We need to sup-
port it on both sides of the aisle.

FEDERAL RESERVE REPEATS 
CYCLE OF CORRUPTION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. CAWTHORN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, 
what do you call a group of unelected, 
unethical, power-hungry bureaucrats 
making policy decisions? In many 
countries, we would call them an oli-
garchy. In the United States, though, 
we call them the Federal Reserve, 
which is funny because the Federal Re-
serve has no reserves, and they are ab-
solutely not part of the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
For decades now, the Federal Reserve 
has diluted the purchasing power of the 
U.S. dollar, decimated private indus-
try, and divvied up the hard-won earn-
ings of U.S. citizens amongst corrupt 
power brokers in Washington and Wall 
Street. 
Let me be clear: Inflation is, at its 
root, a monetary fraud, and the Fed-
eral Reserve is the biggest counter-
feiting operation in American history. 
This isn’t a debate. At this point in our 
history, it is really no longer even a 
discussion. 
Decade after decade, the Federal Re-
serve has repeated the same cycle of 
corruption and destroyed our economy 
in the process. The Federal Reserve 
buys 
bonds 
from 
the 
government, 
printing dollars to finance these pur-
chases. Then they deceive us into ac-
cepting this newly printed and inflated 
paper as currency by making its new 
dollars look like real currency. This is 
the very essence of counterfeiting. 
The Great Depression of the 1930s, 
the great inflation of the 1970s, the 2008 
recession, and now the 2022 recession 
were caused in full, or in part, by the 
greatest currency fraud operation ever 
attempted, aided and abetted by this 
hallowed institution, and built on the 
broken backs and fractured families of 
millions of American citizens. 
Madam Speaker, former President 
Garfield was right when he said who-
ever controls the volume of currency 
and money in any country is absolute 
master of all industry and commerce. 
To the American people, I say that 
your master is not decided at the bal-
lot box. It is not decided in public de-
bate or open dialogue. You didn’t vote 
for the person who controls your life. 
They would never let you. 
Your master is the machine of Fed-
eral finance that, in the name of quan-
titative easing, stripped your right to 
property ownership away from you, 
turned your existence into a groveling 
attempt just to get by, and sucked 
every last drop of autonomy from the 
shriveled husk of what used to be a vi-
brant and prosperous Nation. 
You didn’t vote for the Chair of the 
Federal Reserve. You didn’t vote for 9 
percent inflation. But you can abso-
lutely vote for people who are willing 
to destroy it and give the power back 
to the people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
f 
RECOGNIZING BETHESDA 
PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. NORMAN) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the outstanding 
achievement of a very special church, 
Bethesda Presbyterian Church, located 
in Camden, South Carolina. 
Bethesda Presbyterian Church was 
established before the American Revo-
lutionary War. Its first sanctuary was 
destroyed during that war, and two 
more were built in 1790 and 1806. The 
sanctuary present today was designed 
by Robert Mills. 
The edifice is more classical than 
some of his later work and is one of the 
few surviving ecclesiastical designs. 
The sanctuary, completed over 200 
years ago in 1822, is the work of Mills’ 
maturing architecture, strongly influ-
enced by Jeffersonian classicism. 
In front of the sanctuary is a monu-
ment that is dedicated to the memory 
of Baron DeKalb, a Continental Army 
soldier killed in 1780 at the Battle of 
Camden. In 1985, the church and the 
monument were declared national his-
toric landmarks. 
Bethesda Presbyterian Church’s mis-
sion is: ‘‘To know, love, glorify, and 
serve our Lord God.’’ The church pro-
vides a strong sense of community, fel-
lowship, and worship as the members 
walk in their faith journey during both 
the 
joyous 
times 
and 
challenging 
times. I know personally that their 
members experience tremendous per-
sonal and spiritual growth. 
I am pleased to recognize Bethesda 
Presbyterian as an outstanding church 
faithfully serving the Camden commu-
nity and proudly serving as a historic 
landmark in the Fifth District of 
South Carolina. May God continue to 
bless this church and its congregation.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
God, our rock and our salvation, our 
prayers are, once again, offered unto 
You on behalf of Ukraine. Many are its 
foes. The fearful within its borders 
yearn for the strength of Your justice. 
The adversaries who surround them are 
saying that You will not deliver them. 
But You, O Lord, have proven to be a 
shield around them. You are the source 
of their strength, the one who lifts 
their heads to face their enemies. 
In these seemingly never-ending days 
and months of conflict, in their waking 
and their sleeping, Lord, sustain the 
men and women of Ukraine. May they 
not give in to fear though they are con-
tinually assailed on every front. May 
their faith in You uphold them. 
Arise, O Lord, and deliver the people 
of Ukraine. From You alone comes de-
liverance. May Your blessing be upon 
Your people. 
In Your mighty name we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING RICARDO MARQUES, 
JR. 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, today, we 
recognize the late Ricardo Marques, 
Jr., an outstanding American who 
passed away in July after battling can-
cer. 
Everything that Rick did in his ac-
complished life was done for his family 
and in service to our great Nation. 
Rick was a marine who defended our 
Nation honorably prior to joining the 
Bureau of Prisons. 
Rick spent nearly 30 years with the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons, working at 
both 
USP 
Lewisburg 
and 
FCC 
Allenwood in Pennsylvania’s 12th Con-
gressional District prior to retiring. 
Having toured both of these facili-
ties, it is clear that the men and 
women who work there are outstanding 
individuals. I can tell you, Mr. Speak-
er, that it takes an enormous amount 
of fortitude and sacrifice to do that 
work. 
Everyone who knew Rick remembers 
him as a natural-born leader and as a 
man who left a lasting impression of 
love and respect on everyone he en-
countered. America is better off be-
cause 
of 
Rick’s 
contributions 
and 
work. 
It is my hope that Rick’s family finds 
comfort in his legacy and lifetime of 
service.

U.S. MUST REGAIN ENERGY 
INDEPENDENCE 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, 
under 
President 
Donald 
Trump, in 2020, America exported more 
petroleum than it imported for the 
first time since 1949. Donald Trump 
achieved energy independence. 
However, since Biden came to office, 
the national average for a gallon of 
gasoline is over $1.30 higher per gallon; 
electricity costs are 15 percent more; 
and at this point, Biden has leased 
fewer acres of offshore and Federal 
land for domestic oil and gas produc-
tion than any President in 70 years. 
Also, on day one of his Presidency, 
Biden killed the Keystone XL pipeline, 
which could be supplying 800,000 barrels 
of oil a day from Canada to America. 
Higher gas prices increase delivery 
costs, increasing Bidenflation, which 
destroys jobs. 
Irresponsible decisions by Biden and 
the Democrats are responsible for the 
energy crisis. 
God bless our troops who successfully 
protected America for 20 years, as the 
global war on terrorism moves from a 
safe haven in Afghanistan to America. 
We will always cherish the service of 
Congresswoman Jackie Walorski. And 
God bless Ukraine victory. 
f 
ECONOMY IS CRATERING 
(Mr. MOORE of Alabama asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, President Biden’s Inflation Reduc-
tion Act is bringing fire and rain to the 
White House and to the American peo-
ple. 
Yesterday, Biden and a host of celeb-
rities and politicians, highlighted by a 
James 
Taylor 
serenade, 
celebrated 
their Inflation Reduction Act even as 
the economy cratered in real time. 
As the President spiked the football 
on his supposed accomplishment, the 
Dow tanked nearly 1,300 points and the 
Consumer Price Index rose to 8.3 per-
cent. 
President Biden and Speaker PELOSI 
have taken every opportunity to herald 
deficit reduction, the so-called Infla-
tion Reduction Act, and what it would 
provide. But the nonpartisan Congres-
sional Budget Office just updated the 
score on the new law, and it is worse 
than we thought. The reckless govern-
ment spending on the Green New Deal 
policies in this bill will increase our 
deficit spending through 2026. 
This means the IRS will need to take 
an additional $60 billion from middle- 
class Americans through increased au-
dits to pay for this out-of-control 
spending. 
It shouldn’t surprise anyone that we 
are already suffering the negative ef-
fects of this spending. But Democrats 
are basking in the sunshine of their po-
litical accomplishment despite the eco-
nomic storm it brings for the American 
people. 
Remember: Democrats aren’t just 
taking more money out of your wallet; 
they are celebrating it.

HELPING VETERANS ACCESS 
BENEFITS 
(Mr. AGUILAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1

Mr. AGUILAR. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of my bill, H.R. 5916, the 
Wounded Warrior Access Act. 
When veterans file claims to the VA, 
they are given what is called a c-file. 
My office has heard from countless 
numbers of veterans who have had 
trouble accessing these c-files through 
the VA’s outdated and antiquated sys-
tem. Our veterans need these files in 
order to access benefits that they have 
earned or appeal the VA’s decisions 
about their claims. 
That is why, Mr. Speaker, this legis-
lation is so important. The veterans in 
the Inland Empire and across this 
country need an easy way to access

HONORING JOHN TREES 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor John 
Trees. 
Mr. Trees lived in Springfield, Illi-
nois, and was the loving husband to our 
own district office’s Candice Trees. On 
September 28 of this year, they would 
have celebrated 48 years of marriage. 
John was a proud veteran of the U.S. 
Air Force, serving during the Vietnam 
war. After his years of service, John 
went on to become a skilled laborer 
and accomplished carpenter. 
Once retiring from the Illinois De-
partment of Transportation, John had 
more time to do what he loved. Com-
bining his love of food and serving oth-
ers, John started his own catering busi-
ness aptly named Two Drunks in the 
Dark Catering. 
He truly enjoyed spending time with 
his wife, three daughters, and five 
grandchildren. Going on yearly trips to 
St. Louis Cardinal games or attending 
his 
grandchildren’s 
sporting 
events 
were just a few things ‘‘Papa John’’ 
loved to do. 
John would be the first to lend a 
hand and always had a welcoming door 
at his home. John was always great at 
providing advice and giving direction 
to those who needed him the most. 
We honor John today, and I send my 
deepest condolences to Candice and the 
entire Trees family during this very 
difficult time.

FAMINE, BLACKOUTS, AND 
RATIONING 
(Mrs. MILLER of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, by using diesel-powered equipment, 
nitrogen, and other fertilizers, Amer-
ican farmers feed our Nation and are 
the number one exporter of food world-
wide. 
My fellow farmers and I are alarmed 
because Joe Biden and his green bad 
deal team are in the process of creating 
a food crisis. 
Radical leftists will destroy farms, 
especially family farms, with attacks 
on fertilizer and livestock. The leftists 
are pushing to replace the farmland we 
need for food with solar panels that are 
terrible for the environment and made 
in China. 
Without farms, people starve. Rad-
ical leftists are causing famine, black-
outs, and rationing in other countries. 
We cannot let them control our food 
production.

IS CONGRESS DOING THEIR JOB 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of this institution can be syn-
thesized into one word—‘‘represent.’’ 
But can we, as a hallowed and time- 
honored body truly sit here in the sa-
cred Chamber and say with straight 
faces that we are fulfilling this calling? 
Our woes as a Nation beset us upon 
every side, and this body has through 
inaction or, frankly, malicious action, 
made many crises worse. At the begin-
ning of this Congress our border was in 
shambles. Can we honestly say the sit-
uation has improved even slightly? 
At the start of 2021 our economy was 
teetering. Today the smog and dust of 
collapse have yet to settle. Today we 
are weaker domestically, and frighten-
ingly vulnerable internationally. China 
rises, Russia marches, the Middle East 
implodes, and this body sits on its 
hands and names post offices. 
Hear this: America cannot be saved 
through legislation. Men and women of 
virtue and value must rise to alter the 
very culture of our Nation. Christ, not 
Congress, will be what saves this coun-
try.

poses of this paragraph, the term ‘specified 
request’ means a prior authorization request 
made with respect to an applicable item or

‘‘(4) ENROLLEE
PROTECTION
STANDARDS.— 
For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the Sec-

protection standards with respect to the use 
of prior authorization by Medicare Advan-
tage plans for applicable items and services: 
‘‘(A) Adoption of transparent prior author-
ization programs developed in consultation 
with enrollees and with providers and sup-
pliers with contracts in effect with such 
plans for furnishing such items and services 
under such plans; 
‘‘(B) Allowing for the waiver or modifica-
tion of prior authorization requirements

to evidence-based medical guidelines and 
other quality criteria; and 
‘‘(C) Conducting annual reviews of such 
items and services for which prior authoriza-
tion requirements are imposed under such 
plans through a process that takes into ac-
count input from enrollees and from pro-
viders and suppliers with such contracts in 
effect and is based on consideration of prior 
authorization data from previous plan years 
and analyses of current coverage criteria. 
‘‘(5) APPLICABLE ITEM OR SERVICE.—For pur-
poses of this subsection, the term ‘applicable 
item or service’ means, with respect to a 
Medicare Advantage plan, any item or serv-
ice for which benefits are available under

fifth plan year beginning after the date of 
the enactment of this subsection, and bienni-
ally thereafter through the date that is 10

retary shall submit to Congress a report con-
taining a description of the information sub-
mitted under paragraph (3)(A)(i) during— 
‘‘(i) in the case of the first such report, the 
fourth plan year beginning after the date of 
the enactment of this subsection; and 
‘‘(ii) in the case of a subsequent report, the 
2 plan years preceding the year of the sub-
mission of such report.’’. 
(b) ENSURING TIMELY RESPONSES FOR ALL 
PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS SUBMITTED 
UNDER PART C.—Section 1852(g) of the Social 
Security 
Act 
(42 
U.S.C. 
1395w–22(g)) 
is 
amended— 
(1) in paragraph (1)(A), by inserting ‘‘and in

(3) by adding at the end the following new 
paragraph: 
‘‘(6) TIMEFRAME FOR RESPONSE TO PRIOR AU-
THORIZATION
REQUESTS.—Subject to para-
graph (3) and subsection (o), in the case of an 
organization determination made with re-
spect to a prior authorization request for an 
item or service to be furnished to an indi-
vidual submitted on or after the first day of 
the third plan year beginning after the date 
of the enactment of this paragraph, the orga-
nization shall notify the enrollee (and the 
physician involved, as appropriate) of such 
determination no later than 7 days (or such 
shorter timeframe as the Secretary may 
specify through notice and comment rule-
making, taking into account enrollee and 
stakeholder feedback) after receipt of such 
request.’’. 
SEC. 3. FUNDING. 
The Secretary of Health and Human Serv-
ices shall provide for the transfer, from the 
Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund es-
tablished under section 1817 of the Social Se-
curity Act (42 U.S.C. 1395i) and the Federal 
Supplementary 
Medical 
Insurance 
Trust 
Fund established under section 1841 of such 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1395t) (in such proportion as 
determined appropriate by the Secretary) to 
the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Serv-
ices 
Program 
Management 
Account, 
of 
$25,000,000 for fiscal year 2022, to remain 
available until expended, for purposes of car-
rying out the amendments made by this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Washington. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Washington? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, more than 28 million 
seniors get healthcare through Medi-
care Advantage, including 600,000 in 
Washington State. 
For these seniors and the physicians 
that care for them, we must deliver a 
quality product that allows providers 
to keep our seniors as healthy as pos-
sible while reducing wait times, paper-
work, and hassle. 
Unfortunately, the cumbersome and 
antiquated prior authorization process 
that many Medicare Advantage plans 
utilize often gets in the way. This in-
volves multiple phone calls and faxing 
documents to insurance companies. It 
is 2022, and even Congress has moved 
beyond faxing. 
The HHS Inspector General recently 
reported that prior authorization is re-
sponsible for delaying and even deny-
ing medically necessary care. That 
mirrors reports that we have heard 
from providers for years now. 
In one case, the inspector general 
found that, due to prior authorization, 
a 76-year-old Medicare beneficiary with 
post-polio syndrome was denied a re-
quest for a walker. 
In another case, a Washington State 
resident and professional fisherman 
had to miss this past summer’s fishing 
season in Alaska because his hip sur-
gery was delayed for months. 
According to the American Medical 
Association, one out of every four phy-
sicians report that prior authorization 
has led to a patient being hospitalized. 
Prior authorization is also a burden on 
providers, who spend 13 hours a week 
completing prior authorization paper-
work, often for procedures that are ap-
proved over 95 percent of the time. 
That is time they could be spending 
with patients. 
Today, the House of Representatives 
will take a major step forward in re-
solving this problem. The Improving 
Seniors’ Timely Access to Care Act 
will make commonsense changes to 
prior authorization to ensure our sen-
iors are getting the care they need 
when they need it. 
First, the bill would require all plans 
to use an electronic prior authorization 
system. That means no more phone 
calls, no more faxes, and no more won-
dering what information is needed to 
submit to insurance plans when re-
questing prior authorization. 
Second, we establish a process for 
real-time decisionmaking. It doesn’t 
make sense that services in line with 
standard clinical practice guidelines or 
services that are approved more than 
95 percent of the time are subject to 
prior authorization. 
We also know that delayed approvals 
can result in patients falling through 
the cracks and missing out on care. 
Real-time decisions will help stop that. 
Finally, this bill requires reporting 
on the number of prior authorization 
requests, the rates of approvals and de-
nials, and the rates of successful ap-
peals to increase transparency. 
Collectively, this bill will help pro-
viders spend more time with patients 
and less time with paperwork. 
Today’s vote and the teamwork that 
brought this legislation to this mo-
ment is a bipartisan success story that 
shows that Congress can come together 
and put the needs of the American peo-
ple before the gridlock that we all 
know too well. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
MIKE KELLY, our Republican lead, for 
his tireless work on this for years, also 
our co-leads, Dr. AMI BERA and LARRY 
BUCSHON, as well as Senator ROGER 
MARSHALL, who worked with us when 
he was in the House in the 116th Con-
gress and has continued this effort in 
the Senate. 
I thank the over 300 of my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle who have co-
sponsored this bill. The support for this 
legislation has been overwhelming and 
it has been endorsed by over 500 
healthcare organizations. 
I particularly thank the Regulatory 
Relief Coalition and the American 
Medical Association that helped de-
velop a quality bill and build support 
for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a list of endorsements and the letters

REGULATORY RELIEF COALITION, 
September 12, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Republican Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: Members of the Regulatory Relief Coa-
lition (RRC)—a group of national physician 
specialty organizations advocating for re-
duced regulatory burdens that interfere with 
patient care—thank you for scheduling a 
House floor vote on the Improving Seniors’ 
Timely Access to Care Act on September 14, 
2022. 
This bipartisan bill is supported by more 
than 310 House co-sponsors and over 500 en-
dorsing organizations representing patients, 
health care providers, medical technology 
and 
biopharmaceutical 
industry, 
health 
plans and others. The RRC’s goal is to ensure 
that bureaucratic hurdles do not stand in the 
way of physicians providing medically nec-
essary patient care. 
The Improving Seniors’ Timely Access to 
Care Act would improve prior authorization 
in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program by: 
Establishing an electronic prior authoriza-
tion (ePA) program; 
Standardizing and streamlining the prior 
authorization process for routinely approved 
services, including establishing a list of serv-
ices eligible for real-time prior authorization 
decisions; 
Ensuring prior authorization requests are 
reviewed by qualified medical personnel; and

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, 
September 13, 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND RANKING MEM-
BER MCCARTHY: On behalf of the physician 
and medical student members of the Amer-
ican Medical Association (AMA), I write in 
strong support of H.R. 3173, the ‘‘Improving 
Seniors’ Timely Access to Care Act of 2022.’’ 
This legislation, as originally introduced, 
garnered more than 300 bipartisan House co-
sponsors and the support of approximately 
500 physician, hospital, patient, and insurer 
organizations. We greatly appreciate the 
House of Representatives scheduling a vote 
on this bipartisan legislation, which was fa-
vorably reported out of the Ways and Means 
Committee in July, and strongly urge swift 
passage to help streamline, simplify, and 
standardize prior authorization processes 
within Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. 
Prior authorization, which is the practice 
by insurance companies of reviewing and po-
tentially denying medical services and phar-
maceuticals prior to treatment, remains a 
principal frustration for patients and physi-
cians. This utilization management policy is 
overused, costly, opaque, burdensome to phy-
sicians, and harmful to patients due to 
delays in care. 
AMA data compiled from annual surveys of 
more than l,000 practicing physicians con-
tinue to illustrate the negative impact of 
prior authorization policies. In fact, 34 per-
cent of physicians who participated in a 2021 
AMA survey reported that prior authoriza-
tion led to a serious adverse event, such as 
hospitalization, disability, permanent bodily 
damage, or even death, for a patient in their 
care. The 2021 survey also highlights that 93 
percent of physicians reported care delays 
associated with prior authorization, while 82 
percent of respondents cited that these re-
quirements can at least sometimes lead to 
patients abandoning treatments. 
In addition, research from the federal gov-
ernment demonstrates that prior authoriza-
tion leads to delays in patient care and inap-
propriate denials of medically necessary 
services. A 2018 report from the Department 
of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office 
of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that, 
between 2014 and 2016, MA plans overturned 
75 percent oftheir own prior authorization 
and payment denials when appealed by pro-
viders and beneficiaries. An April 2022 HHS 
OIG report also found that 13 percent of prior 
authorization requests denied by MA plans 
met Medicare coverage rules, and 18 percent 
of payment request denials met Medicare 
and MA billing rules. 
We commend the House of Representatives 
for working in a bipartisan fashion to de-
velop an amended version of the Improving 
Seniors’ Timely Access to Care Act. The 
modified legislation retains the crux of the 
original bill, the ‘‘Improving Seniors’ Timely 
Access to Care Act of 2021,’’ including man-
dating that MA plans implement electronic 
prior authorization programs that adhere to 
new standards adopted by the federal govern-
ment. This will help ensure that physicians 
are no longer forced to resort to faxes and e- 
forms, or even disparate, proprietary portals 
that fail to comply with these newly devel-
oped standards, when seeking to complete 
prior authorization requests. In addition, the 
provisions requiring robust data reporting, 
such as the number and percentage of prior 
authorization requests approved, denied, or 
approved upon appeal, will bring much need-
ed transparency to ensure MA prior author-
ization programs are not inappropriately de-
nying medically necessary care to patients 
and overburdening physicians with unneces-
sary requirements. 
Most importantly, the additional sections 
of the legislation mandating MA plans to 
issue faster prior authorization decisions are 
crucial policy improvements that will ensure 
more timely access to care and, as a result, 
improve patient health care outcomes and 
better stewardship of scarce Medicare re-
sources. The AMA supports the requirements 
for health plans to provide real-time prior 
authorization decisions for routinely ap-
proved services, as defined in implementing 
regulations. We also appreciate that the bill 
directs MA plans unable to meet the real- 
time processing requirement in the event of 
‘‘extenuating circumstances’’ to issue final 
prior authorization decisions within a 72- 
hour and 24-hour timeline for regular and 
emergent services, respectively. Notably, the 
legislation requires MA plans to report the 
number of prior authorizations subject to 
this exception, providing the transparency 
needed to deter abuse of this provision. 
In addition, we sincerely appreciate the in-
clusion of provisions pertaining to more 
timely prior authorization decisions for all 
other services within Medicare Part C. Re-
quiring MA plans to issue final decisions 
within 24 hours for emergent services and no 
later than seven days after receipt of regular 
prior authorization requests is a vast im-
provement over current MA program prac-
tices. The expedited timelines for MA plans 
to issue final prior authorization decisions, 
both for routinely approved care and all 
other services, will undoubtedly lessen the 
burden on physicians, and, most signifi-
cantly, ensure timely patient care and im-
proved health outcomes. 
The AMA is proud to support the Improv-
ing Seniors’ Timely Access to Care Act. We 
commend the House of Representatives for 
voting on this legislation and stand ready to 
work to ensure bipartisan passage by the 
Senate. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES L. MADARA, MD. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I also 
thank the staff from the personal of-
fices and from the committee and lead-
ership offices that have spent countless 
hours researching this issue and work-
ing with stakeholders to develop this 
legislation. 
In particular, I thank my former leg-
islative director, Kyle Hill, who was 
truly integral in developing and ad-
vancing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative 
DELBENE for being with me today. 
We are really proud of this bill be-
cause it has taken a lot of time to get 
there, and it has taken so many people 
on both sides of the aisle looking at it 
and saying this is something that just 
makes sense. 
The purpose of the Improving Sen-
iors’ Timely Access to Care Act is very 
simple: it is to protect our seniors. 
They deserve fast, high-quality care 
when they see their doctor, not bureau-
cratic paperwork and delays. Unfortu-
nately, our current prior authorization 
system often produces just that. 
My office has heard countless stories 
of Pennsylvanians being affected by 
having their care delayed due to prior 
authorizations. 
One 
ophthalmology 
practice reported that they had prob-
lems getting both of a patients’ eyes 
authorized for a basic operation be-
cause the system rejected the second 
eye as a duplicate. 
At the University of Pittsburgh’s De-
partment of Neurosurgery, doctors can 
perform an advanced surgery with a 
Gamma Knife to control brain tumors. 
In many cases, these operations give 
patients life and more time. The prob-
lem is that it takes prior authoriza-
tion, and care is delayed for way, way 
too long costing patients’ valuable 
time. 
As a result, patients lose confidence 
in the medical system, and they also 
begin to lose hope. That is why we are 
here today, to move the prior author-
ization process into the 21st century 
and give doctors and health insurance 
plans the tools they need to make 
these decisions more quickly. 
The current system allows insurance 
plans to take weeks to review prior au-
thorization requests, leaving patients 
waiting. The process is often manual, 
requiring fax machines, phone calls, 
and paper submissions, meaning doc-
tors cannot easily appeal these deci-
sions. 
The Improving Seniors’ Timely Ac-
cess to Care Act requires prior author-
ization decisions to be done faster, 
helping seniors get care more quickly. 
Most routinely approved prior author-
ization items and services will receive 
a real-time electronic response. 
For nonroutinely approved items, 
doctors and patients will have clear ex-
pectations of how long they are going 
to need to wait for a response, allowing 
them to better coordinate their care. 
Additionally, health insurance plans 
must begin to disclose data on how 
many prior authorizations they ap-
prove or deny, along with an analysis 
of how they made that decision.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7802 
September 14, 2022 
Truthfully, I have seen many similar 
situations in the business I have been 
in my whole life. I am an automobile 
dealer, and when we are working on an 
owner’s car under warranty, too often 
it is a negotiation with a manufacturer 
on what repairs we are able to do. 
The manufacturer does their own 
time studies on how long they think it 
should take and what they think 
should be repaired. But oftentimes 
those time studies are on a brand new 
car or truck just off the assembly line. 
As we all know, living in western Penn-
sylvania, we have a lot of steep hills, 
and we go through really rough winters 
where there are a lot of things put on 
the road—salt and whatever else—that 
can corrode different parts once they 
are in operation. 
It is the same story with insurance 
companies when we are doing covered 
auto body work. We have to give the 
insurance company the estimates be-
fore we ever touch a car or truck, and 
then continuously negotiate with them 
as we get into the tear-down of the ve-
hicle and find other damage. We have 
to go back and get authorization to do 
that, and that holds up the process. 
As much as people say, now, wait, 
wait, wait, don’t compare cars and 
trucks and that warranty work to pa-
tients. You know what? It is the same 
thing. It is the same thing. You are de-
nied access to care that you need 
today, not tomorrow, not some time in 
the future. There is no reason why you 
should have to wait for it, not in to-
day’s world, and not with the way we 
are able to improve all of this. 
I know when I talked to Dr. BERA or 
Dr. BUCSHON and especially with Ms. 
DELBENE, we think: Why in the world 
are we working on old ways of getting 
answers as opposed to being able to get 
them today and get them more quick-
ly? 
I just think what we are doing makes 
sense. I would rely more on a techni-
cian who has expert experience than 
somebody who does time studies on 
something that isn’t actually the du-
plicate of what we are looking to do. 
This whole thing is about protecting 
our seniors, the people who have done 
the most for this generation and pre-
vious generations, who have really put 
their shoulders to the wheel and have 
never ever complained and always done 
what they think is best. 
Why in the world would we make it 
harder for them to get the healthcare 
they deserve? Why? That makes abso-
lutely no sense to any of us. This is not 
a red concern or a blue concern. It is 
all about red, white, and blue. It is 
about Americans. It is not Republicans 
or Democrats or Libertarians or any-
thing else. It is about this body’s obli-
gation to come together on issues that 
are really critical. 
There never should be this type of 
work that we have had to go through 
to get this done. And then all of a sud-
den last night, by the way, the CBO de-
cided after 11 months to weigh in on 
how we would score this legislation. 
They waited until the 11th hour, and 
right after the 11th hour they pulled 
back what they had said they thought 
the cost was going to be. 
I don’t know how anybody runs a 
business like that. 
I know if I give somebody an esti-
mate or tell somebody something is 
going to be done at a certain time—and 
I know we make commitments to all of 
the people we represent, give them the 
right answer in the right time. Why 
make them wait for something that is 
so basic? 
I know we always have this concern 
about fraud, waste, and abuse. My com-
plaint really comes down to service. 
We can complain about a lot of things, 
but we cannot complain about what we 
owe our seniors. 
We wrote and rewrote this bill over 
the course of the last several years to 
ensure it was as strong as possible, 
using everything that is available to us 
today to implement, to get answers 
quicker, not longer, not put people off, 
not tell them to wait in the waiting 
room, not tell them to stay on hold, 
but to get them an answer and get 
them the care that they need today.

Feedback is important. Honesty is 
more important. I know Ms. DELBENE 
and Dr. BERA and Dr. BUCSHON and so 
many of our colleagues agree the same 
way, and all the staff members that 
you mentioned. 
This is not something that just hap-
pened very quickly and on the back of 
an envelope. This is something that a 
great deal of concern went into, a great 
deal of care went into, and a great deal 
of looking into went into. 
So I am going to thank my col-
leagues, and I am going to ask every-
body today, when this comes up for a 
vote, please vote for seniors. Please 
vote for all of those who have done so 
much for all of us. And take this oppor-
tunity to thank them in a way that 
really makes sense and, that is, by say-
ing, you have played the game well; 
you have played the game long. You 
have done so much for all of us. Why 
don’t we do something for all of you? 
So I thank my colleague—it has been 
great—and all our colleagues for get-
ting on board on this. It has been a 
really good example of how, when we 
actually work together on good policy 
and don’t worry about the politics of 
it, amazing, amazing what can get done 
for the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. CHU), my colleague on the 
Ways and Means Committee, another 
leader of this legislation. 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of my colleague, Rep-
resentative DELBENE’s bill, the Improv-
ing Seniors’ Timely Access to Care 
Act. I have heard from countless pa-
tients in my southern California dis-
trict whose care has been delayed for 
weeks and, in some cases, outright de-
nied because of countless barriers and 
archaic approval methods. And I have 
heard directly from physicians who are 
at their wits end, unable to provide the 
care they know will help their patients 
because of endless red tape. 
The Improving Seniors’ Timely Ac-
cess to Care Act makes thoughtful and 
much-needed 
improvements 
to 
the 
Medicare system to correct these prob-
lems. The bill before us today will pro-
mote modernization of the prior au-
thorization system to speed up approv-
als of routine procedures. 
It moves the system of prior author-
ization into the 21st century, away 
from fax machines and toward elec-
tronic approval methods. By short-
ening the window by which insurance 
plans must respond to a prior author-
ization request, the bill will ensure pa-
tients get the care they need when 
they need it. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important legislation. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take a moment also 
to thank the Regulatory Relief Coali-
tion because they have been working 
hand in hand with us trying to contact 
as many members as they can. And 
today is an example of when we work 
together, what we can get done. 
Mr. Speaker, I present one of the doc-
tors in our Doctors Caucus from North 
Carolina, Dr. MURPHY, to give his actu-
ally on-the-job, on-the-field experience 
of what it is like to try to work 
through this massive group of—I don’t 
know what you call these people. They 
are hard to work with and they don’t 
represent us. They do represent some-
thing else. I think we need to represent 
just our folks back home. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY). 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Representatives 
DELBENE and KELLY for putting forth 
the timely Improving Seniors’ Timely 
Access to Care Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ex-
plain to the public what pre-authoriza-
tion means. I am a practicing physi-
cian, so if I order a test, I recommend 
a surgery, it then goes into a bucket at 
an insurance agency, and then we play 
the great waiting game. The patient is 
no longer in the office because we have 
no idea how long that waiting game is. 
It was put in and accepted for what I 
believe was a good cause. But as with 
many government programs, or insti-
tutions, or institutions of our bureauc-
racy in the private sector even, it is 
something that has gone bad and gone 
terribly wrong. 
I may be waiting 2 or 3 or 4 weeks to 
speak with somebody who is not my 
peer. I am a surgeon. I may be speaking 
with a pediatrician or, even more, I 
might be speaking with a nurse practi-
tioner who has no experience whatso-
ever in my field of study to get their 
approval of something that I know 
needs to happen. It is an absolutely an-
tiquated system that does not work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7803 
September 14, 2022 
I am going to give you a couple of ex-
amples. Approximately 10 weeks ago, I 
saw a prostate cancer patient. There 
were two avenues to go on this: Either 
he needed to be operated on very quick-
ly, or the cat was out of the bag, and he 
needed intensive chemotherapy quick-
ly. 
A week goes by, 2 weeks go by. What 
is that patient doing at home? He 
hasn’t slept one wink because his en-
tire future, his entire life, is then sus-
pended in front of him. 
It took 3 weeks, 3 weeks to get the 
study that every urologist in the coun-
try knew was necessary to get that an-
swer. Yet, in the meantime, that pa-
tient has lost years, just in life as far 
as worry. 
A second; one of my partners did a 
very complicated surgery on a patient. 
The patient was a bad diabetic; came in 
a week or two later with a wound infec-
tion. Fine, come in, get some intensive 
IV antibiotics. Try to get the patient 
out of the hospital because we know it 
is good to get patients out of the hos-
pital when they don’t need to be in the 
hospital. 
He needed a certain oral antibiotic 
that was prescribed for him. It was de-
nied. It was denied. It was denied. A 
week and a half later, he shows up in 
my office as an emergency. I have to 
send him over somewhat late in the 
afternoon, so that means he gets on the 
OR schedule at 10:00, 11:00, or 2 a.m., 
and has to have an abscess drained. 
And then he is in the hospital now an-
other 2 weeks because he didn’t get 
that antibiotic prescribed to him when 
he should have because it was denied, 
his authorization. 
Mr. Speaker, I know the CBO score 
came in. I don’t believe it. I have lived 
and breathed this for 30-plus years. I 
don’t believe it. It doesn’t pass the 
smell test. To come up at the last 
minute with this score, in my opinion, 
is erroneous and needs to be looked at 
again, because I look at the savings 
that we, as physicians, provide in 
knowing what is right for our patients 
in the moment versus some bureaucrat 
in an insurance company who is given 
the directive to deny, deny, deny, is 
not what we should be doing in medi-
cine. Our medical system has become 
bankrupt and these pre-authorizations 
are part of it. 
So I have a hard time going along 
with the CBO score of $16 billion be-
cause I don’t believe it. This is what is 
right for patients. This is decades past 
the time when this should have been 
done. 
I look at the doctors that I have 
worked with, and we are just plagued 
in clinic, because we know what we are 
going to recommend for our patients 
after years of study and work with pa-
tients is going to be possibly denied by 
someone who has no experience who 
has been told by insurance companies, 
deny, deny, and deny until they wear 
out the doctor and wear out the pa-
tient. 
So, Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty, I 
believe, to not pass this bill. I also do 
not believe the CBO score, and I think 
it is a great injustice for our patients 
to be denied care because of this anti-
quated pre-authorization system. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, it is so 
important that we work with experts 
in the medical community to develop 
strong legislation, and we are incred-
ibly fortunate to have as one of our co- 
leads on this bill one of our doctors in 
Congress, so I want to thank him for 
all of his incredible work getting us to 
where we are today. 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. BERA). 
Mr. BERA. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
first thank my colleague from the 
great 
State 
of 
Washington, 
Ms. 
DELBENE, as well as my good friend 
from Pennsylvania, Mr. KELLY, as well 
as my fellow doctor, Dr. BUCSHON. 
This was how legislative processes 
should work. You identify a challenge, 
you work on it, you work on it in a bi-
partisan way. But you put the Amer-
ican patient first because that is what 
this it about at the end of the day. How 
do we give efficient, quality care to 
America’s patients, and, in this case, 
America’s seniors. 
I have been practicing medicine 
going back to 1995. And yeah, I have 
used a fax machine back in 1995. This is 
about coming into the 21st century, 
modernizing the practice of medicine. 
It is also about letting us do what we 
went to medical school for, what we did 
residency 
for. 
After 
4 
years 
of 
undergrad, 4 years of medical school, 
anywhere from 3 to 7 years and longer 
of residency training, doctors want to 
be doctors. They want to take care of 
their patients. 
Yes, there is a role for prior author-
ization in limited cases. There is also a 
role to go back and retrospectively 
look at how care is being delivered. But 
what is happening today is a travesty. 
It wasn’t the intention of prior author-
ization. It is a prior authorization 
process gone awry. And let me give you 
some examples. 
When I talk to my former colleagues, 
the folks I went to medical school 
with, they spend up to 40 percent of 
their time on paperwork, on adminis-
trative burden, on doing things that 
don’t enhance clinical care or enhance 
their ability to take care of patients. 
We heard Dr. MURPHY talk about the 
delays in care. That adds costs, that 
adds time, and in some cases, it occa-
sionally will potentially kill a patient. 
That isn’t what this is about. 
This is about providing America’s 
seniors efficient care, reducing the bur-
den, and allowing doctors to do what 
we went to medical school for, take 
care of patients. 
Let’s bring this into the 21st century, 
and let’s start to put the patient cen-
tral in American healthcare. And that 
is how we are going to actually lower 
costs of care, deliver better outcomes, 
and improve satisfaction. 
We see a lot of doctors leaving the 
practice of medicine because of that 
administrative burden, the hassle fac-
tor. That doesn’t improve care. That 
actually makes care worse. 
So let’s move into the 21st century. 
Let’s deliver that care, and let’s move 
forward. 
This is a shining example of how Con-
gress should work. If you think about 
it, 320-plus Members of Congress, in a 
bipartisan way, of the House, support 
this legislation. All of the doctors in 
Congress support this legislation. You 
have got Senate support of this legisla-
tion. Over 500 groups of my colleagues 
support this legislation. It is about 
good medicine. It is about taking care 
of the patients. 
I also want to recognize my prior 
senior healthcare legislative assistant, 
Colleen Nguyen, who worked incredibly 
hard on this, as well as my current 
healthcare legislative assistant, Harsh 
Patel. As Congresswoman DELBENE 
pointed out, it is the staff that makes 
us look good. 
Everybody should vote for this, and 
we should pass it unanimously. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
I know Dr. BERA is leaving the floor 
right now. 
So often, when I am home and I am 
here, we always pick winners and los-
ers and, somehow, that becomes the 
main objective of who won, who lost. 
So we are worried today about the 
score. It doesn’t matter on the score 
because everybody wins on this. There 
is no loser on this. 
And if we can’t look to the people 
who have supported us our whole lives 
and have created opportunities that 
exist in this country on their backs, 
what in the world are we doing here? 
Well, I can’t tell you how much I ap-
preciate the opportunity to be with Ms. 
DELBENE. This is incredible to get this 
done today. 
I am urging every single Member to 
vote for this. Please throw out your 
scorecard and look at the picture in 
your wallet of who it is that parented 
you or grandparented you and say you 
know what, wouldn’t it be nice to give 
them something back after they gave 
us their whole life? And let them have 
some peace of mind. 
I don’t think there is anything great-
er in your later years than peace of 
mind and being able to know that I am 
getting healthcare when I need it. I am 
not going to have to wait for somebody 
someplace else to determine whether I 
should get it. 
So it has been a pleasure working 
with you. It has been a pleasure work-
ing with all of our colleagues. And for 
Dr. MARSHALL, who used to sit here 
with us but now is over in the senior 
area of this magnificent model—al-
though, I think he is too young to be 
there. Now, I am sure my older Sen-
ators will say, hey, KELLY, please don’t 
call us old. I won’t. Let’s just say the 
more seasoned Members. 
But I am glad we can wrap this up on 
a really good note. I can’t tell you how 
good I feel about this, that we can go

resent—I don’t care how they vote. All 
I want them to know is we care about 
what they have done for us, and we are 
going to be able to supply them some 
peace of mind. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I think 
it is past time for us to help our sen-
iors get timely care. It is past time to 
help our medical professionals, our 
doctors, our nurses, and others who are 
burdened with undue paperwork, to 
help them spend more time providing 
care. It is past time for us to move a 
strong piece of legislation that has 
strong bipartisan support. 
I thank Chairman NEAL and everyone 
who has helped bring this legislation 
forward, folks on the Ways and Means 
Committee, including my colleague 
Mr. KELLY. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this legislation, an 
incredible piece of work. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, DC, September 14, 2022. 
MR. BLUMENAUER: Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support this important legislation 
to protect seniors’ access to care in the 
Medicare Advantage program. 
As many of you know, I have been a long-
time champion of Medicare Advantage, and 
it’s enjoyed tremendous popularity in Or-
egon. I believe that the way traditional fee- 
for-service Medicare operates is not sustain-
able and that Medicare Advantage is one of 
the tools we can use to demonstrate how we 
can incentivize value. 
But this is only possible when the program 
operates as intended. I have been deeply con-
cerned about the reports of delays in care, 
not only from the Inspector General, but 
from the constituents that come into my of-
fice. For patients and their families, being 
told that you need to wait longer for care 
that your doctor tells you that you need is 
incredibly 
frustrating 
and 
frightening. 
There’s no comfort to be found in the fact 
that your insurance company needs time to 
decide if your doctor is right. For providers, 
the burden of prior authorization is im-
mense. And at a time where we consistently 
hear that our health care workers are facing 
incredible burnout and are leaving the pro-
fession in alarming rates, it’s critical that 
we remove unnecessary processes. 
There is no reason that patients should be 
waiting for medically appropriate care espe-
cially when we know that this can lead to 
worse outcomes. The fundamental promise of 
Medicare Advantage is undermined when 
people are delaying care, getting sicker, and 
ultimately costing Medicare more money. 
The legislation we are taking up today is 
commonsense policy that moves us towards 
the goals of the program and protects our pa-
tients and providers from unnecessary road-
blocks to care. I want to commend Congress-
woman DelBene for her leadership on this 
issue and I look forward to supporting this 
bipartisan legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. DELBENE) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3173, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is recognized 
for 1 hour. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, for the 
purpose of debate only, I yield the cus-
tomary 30 minutes to the gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), pending which I yield

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, on Tues-
day, the Rules Committee met and re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 1339, 
providing for consideration of three 
measures: H.R. 302, H.R. 2988, and H.R. 
8326, all under structured rules. 
For H.R. 302, the rule provides 1 hour 
of general debate equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform, makes in order 
one amendment, and provides a motion 
to recommit. 
For H.R. 2988 and H.R. 8326, the rule 
provides 1 hour of general debate equal-
ly divided and controlled by the chair 
and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
for each bill, makes in order four 
amendments for H.R. 2988 and three 
amendments for H.R. 8326, and provides 
en bloc authority for both bills and mo-
tions to recommit for both bills. 
The rule further provides the major-
ity leader or his designee the ability 
this week to en bloc requested roll call 
votes on suspension bills considered 
from September 13 to September 16. 
Lastly, the rule provides same-day 
authority through September 30 for a 
measure dealing with continuing ap-
propriations for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2023. 
b 1300 
Mr. Speaker, I rise proudly today in 
support of House Resolution 1339, the 
rule for three crucial bills, each of 
which will protect an essential institu-
tion in American Government and pub-
lic life that came under serious attack 
in the previous administration: our 
Federal civil service, whistleblowers 
acting against public corruption, and 
the Census Bureau. All three bills were 
marked up and passed by the House 
Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
H.R. 302, the Preventing a Patronage 
System Act, is a bipartisan bill led by 
Congressman CONNOLLY of Virginia and 
Congressman FITZPATRICK of Pennsyl-
vania. This legislation will insulate our 
civil service against partisan political 
interference and ensure that no future 
President can fire government experts 
and civil servants simply to replace 
them with their own political loyalists 
and sycophants. 
The civil service system was created 
in the 19th century with the explicit 
purpose of ending the so-called spoils 
system and ensuring that Federal em-
ployees are hired, promoted, and fired 
based on their qualifications and per-
formance, not their political party con-
nections or the political favors and 
services they are willing to render to 
elected officials. 
The merit-based Federal workforce 
exists to effectively implement Federal 
laws and programs passed by Congress 
and signed into law by the President 
and translate those laws and programs 
into concrete results and benefits for 
the American people. Professional civil 
servants, like scientists, engineers, me-
teorologists, 
statisticians, 
economic 
researchers, and policy analysts must 
be able to do their jobs and advise gov-
ernment officials and the public based 
on empirical methods, facts and data, 
not ideological filters and bars of polit-
ical correctness, and without fear of re-
taliation and discharge for political 
reasons. 
But the previous administration at-
tempted to turn our civil service, Mr. 
Speaker, into a top-down political and 
ideological party machine, the kind 
that the original architects of civil 
service tried to dismantle in the 19th 
century. In October of 2020, the former 
President issued Executive Order 13957 
to create Schedule F, a sweeping new 
employment category for career civil 
servants who work on public policy 
issues. Schedule F specifically targeted 
about 50,000 presently nonpartisan pol-
icy experts, many of them holding ad-
vanced degrees and having served for 
decades as policy experts across dif-
ferent administrations with Presidents 
from different political parties. 
For these civil servants, Schedule F 
would have stripped away their rights, 
their merit-based legal protections, 
and their professional independence. 
Civil servants transferred into the new 
Schedule F could have been fired and 
replaced at any time for any political 
or ideological reason or for no reason 
at all given by a hostile administra-
tion. The 50,000 civil servants deemed 
to be involved in formulating policy 
could have been swept up in a Schedule 
F political purge and replaced with un-
qualified loyalists and flunkies, with 
potentially catastrophic consequences 
for national security, the continuity of

governance, and the evenhanded and ef-
fective enforcement of Federal laws 
and programs. 
The President already has the oppor-
tunity to appoint more than 4,000 polit-
ical appointees. But Schedule F sought 
to go much further in radically trans-
forming the civil service into an in-
strument of the chosen political ends 
and designs of the President. 
Thankfully, President Joe Biden re-
scinded the order in January 2021. How-
ever, several top Republicans have al-
ready expressed support for picking up 
right where the previous administra-
tion left off with a new Schedule F. 
Our civil servants must be hired 
based on their merits and then evalu-
ated based on their actual job perform-
ance in office, not their political party 
membership, 
not 
their 
ideological 
viewpoints, and not their political 
campaign activism. Indeed, there are 
already processes in place for evalu-
ating Federal employees’ actual job 
performance, which is why in 2021, 
more than 10,000 Federal employees 
were removed from their jobs for not 
living up to job expectations. That is 
how you deal with people who are not 
actually doing their jobs. This bill is 
precisely about ensuring that civil 
servants will be evaluated based on 
their job performance and not the par-
tisan political goals or extracurricular 
demands of a particular administra-
tion. 
As a member of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform, which consid-
ered this legislation carefully and re-
ported it favorably and the proud Rep-
resentative of tens of thousands of Fed-
eral workers in Maryland’s beautiful 
Eighth District, I am proud to advance 
this bill and urge all of my colleagues 
to support its passage on a bipartisan 
basis. We have an urgent mandate to 
protect the historic merit-based civil 
service and the integrity of the Federal 
Government against anyone who would 
turn the clock back more than a cen-
tury to allow Presidents to convert our 
Federal workforce in service of agreed- 
upon Federal laws and programs into 
an instrument of personal ambition, 
campaign reelection, or party patron-
age. 
Now, turning to H.R. 2988, the bipar-
tisan Whistleblower Protection Im-
provement Act of 2021, led by Chair-
woman MALONEY. This is another piece 
of critical legislation in defense of an-
other critical democratic safeguard. 
Whistleblowers are a great American 
institution and an important mecha-
nism for guaranteeing the integrity of 
government. Our protection of whistle-
blowers reflects the fact that in our 
system of government, we have checks 
and balances all the way down. An in-
dividual Federal employee can hold 
even the most powerful government of-
ficials accountable to the rule of law, 
which binds all of us. Whistleblowers in 
American history have exposed self- 
dealing, bribery, kickbacks, sweetheart 
contracts, lost and stolen Federal prop-
erty, national security failures, crimi-
nal coverups, other political corrup-
tion, war crimes, rape and sexual har-
assment in the military, major public 
health violations, episodes of environ-
mental and toxic contamination, and 
the systematic waste or pilfering of 
taxpayer dollars. 
This bill will improve current protec-
tions for whistleblowers by clearly pro-
hibiting retaliatory investigations and 
other actions against Federal employ-
ees who share information with Con-
gress, the House of Representatives, or 
the Senate, or with their supervisor. 
The bill limits the public disclosure of 
the identity of whistleblowers and ex-
tends whistleblower protections to new 
categories of Federal officers and em-
ployees, including Public Health Serv-
ice workers and the National Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration’s 
commissioned officers. 
The bill also contains provisions to 
ensure a timely and fair procedure for 
whistleblowers facing discrimination 
and retaliation. Currently, the backlog 
at the Merit Systems Protection Board 
means that some whistleblowers may 
wait years for a hearing to be sched-
uled on their claims. This bill grants 
whistleblowers access to a jury trial in 
Federal district court if the Merit Sys-
tems Protection Board does not render 
a timely decision in their case. 
Whistleblowers are integral to gov-
ernment transparency and account-
ability in our country. I strongly sup-
port this bill to ensure whistleblowers 
can come forward without fear of re-
prisal or punishment. 
The last bill before us, Mr. Speaker, 
H.R. 8326, the Ensuring a Fair and Ac-
curate Census Act, also led by Chair-
woman MALONEY, will protect the Cen-
sus Bureau against future efforts at po-
litical interference, and it will ensure 
the Bureau’s independence in the per-
formance of its essential duties. 
The Census is a constitutional man-
date and imperative. The U.S. Con-
stitution requires an actual enumera-
tion of the whole number of persons in 
the country for apportioning Rep-
resentatives among the States and 
Congress. The Census is an expression 
of the original principle that democ-
racy must rest on the Jeffersonian idea 
of the consent of the governed. And, 
therefore, we need to know everyone 
who is here and part of the sovereign 
people of the Nation. The Census deter-
mines congressional apportionment of 
House seats and the allocation of tril-
lions of dollars of Federal spending. 
Even many businesses in the private 
sector rely on Census Bureau statistics 
to guide their decisions. 
The previous administration’s spec-
tacular contempt for our constitu-
tional system was on full display dur-
ing its many efforts to interfere with 
the 2020 Census for purposes of political 
gain. The effort to complete a com-
prehensive and effective Census was 
undermined at every turn by efforts 
such as the unlawful plot to add the 
citizenship question to the short form, 
which was struck down by the Supreme 
Court, or the installation of a record- 
breaking number of highly partisan po-
litical appointees to the ranks of the 
Bureau’s leadership. The reforms con-
tained in the Ensuring a Fair and Ac-
curate Census Act will safeguard the 
integrity of the Census count against 
this type of sinister political inter-
ference in the many years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I will reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the distinguished gen-
tleman and my good friend from Mary-
land for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today 
provides for consideration for three 
pieces of legislation that are laser-fo-
cused on a President who has not been 
in office for almost 2 years now. 
Meanwhile, yesterday’s CPI reading 
came in higher than expected, reg-
istering an 8.3 percent year-over-year 
increase. That is another 40-year high, 
literally the highest in my lifetime. 
It is abundantly clear that Demo-
crats are focused on their efforts of po-
litical gamesmanship, hoping to dis-
tract the American people from the ab-
solute failures of the Biden administra-
tion. 
Let’s just go through these bills. The 
first bill, H.R. 302, makes it even hard-
er for the President to remove insubor-
dinate Federal employees in policy- 
making roles. All this legislation ac-
complishes 
is 
further 
shielding 
unelected career bureaucrats from ac-
countability to the American voter, 
who are footing the bill for their sal-
ary. The Federal Government should be 
responsive to the voters and their 
elected Representatives, not the whims 
and 
the 
ideological 
leanings 
of 
unelected bureaucrats. 
Additionally, this rule provides for 
consideration of H.R. 2988, the Whistle-
blower Protection Improvement Act. 
Let me start by just saying that the 
need to protect whistleblowers is one of 
the most bipartisan points of agree-
ment in Congress. However, this legis-
lation does nothing to protect actual 
whistleblowers. There is a significant 
difference lost in this bill between re-
taliation against legitimate whistle-
blowers and the consequences in re-
sponse to unacceptable actions taken 
by a government employee. 
Finally, the rule provides for consid-
eration of H.R. 8326, Ensuring a Fair 
and Accurate Census Act. Yet, this bill 
does everything but ensure a fair and 
accurate Census. Specifically, H.R. 8326 
provides the director of the Census Bu-
reau with unprecedented power and au-
thority to make all operational, statis-
tical, and technical decisions for the 
Census. 
Further, this bill constrains the abil-
ity of future Censuses to include crit-
ical questions, including a citizenship 
question, ensuring that future Cen-
suses will be unfair and inaccurate. 
Instead of focusing on real-life issues 
facing 
everyday 
Americans,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7807 
September 14, 2022 
Democrats this week are focusing on 
three bills that are completely irrele-
vant to the multiple crises created by 
Joe Biden’s policies. 
In fact, two of these bills have al-
ready passed in the House this Con-
gress in larger packages. The failed 
policies of the far left and the Biden 
administration have plunged our econ-
omy into a recession. And, yes, it is a 
recession. They have stolen wages from 
the American workforce, they have de-
stroyed seniors’ retirement savings, 
and they have left families with the 
highest food prices since 1979. Let me 
repeat that. Grocery prices surged 13 
percent in August, the largest increase 
in over 40 years. 
Mr. Speaker, 80 percent of Americans 
say that inflation is the most impor-
tant issue facing the country, but you 
wouldn’t know it by the bills the 
Democrats are prioritizing and running 
on the floor this week. 
I think it is time my Democratic col-
leagues listened to the people and work 
with Republicans on real economic so-
lutions, rather than doubling down on 
these dangerous, reckless, out-of-con-
trol spending and far-left policy bills, 
the same policies that have created the 
crises that we are now facing. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this rule, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am de-
lighted to hear my good friend from 
Pennsylvania make his presentation. I 
was surprised that he described these 
three bills as completely irrelevant, 
given that one is about protecting the 
integrity of the Federal civil service, a 
force of more than 2 million people who 
are doing the work of the American 
people in the National Park Service, 
the Department of Energy, the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of 
State, the Department of Homeland Se-
curity, and so on. 
I don’t know what is completely ir-
relevant about that. Nor do I under-
stand what is completely irrelevant 
about protecting the rights and our en-
couragement of Federal workers to be 
whistleblowers when there is massive 
waste, fraud, abuse, or exploitation 
taking 
place 
with 
the 
taxpayers’ 
money. That is an essential purpose of 
government. 
We have a government that is an in-
strument of the will of the people, and 
we have a lot of public policies that are 
being enforced, but we want to make 
sure that they are being enforced cor-
rectly and that the people’s taxpayer 
moneys are being respected. 
The whistleblowers are helping us do 
that in blowing the whistle on hun-
dreds of millions of dollars of waste, 
corruption, and abuse that have taken 
place. Why we would turn a blind eye 
to that and describe it as completely 
irrelevant is beyond me. 
Of course, the Census is foundational 
to the workings of American democ-
racy, and we want to prevent precisely 
the kind of political finger-pointing all 
over the Census Bureau and our laws 
that we saw in the last administration. 
I am just curious whether the gen-
tleman really believes that if the cur-
rent President suggested that we take 
40,000 or 50,000 Federal workers who 
presently have civil service protection 
and put them directly under his con-
trol 
for 
political 
appointment, 
he 
would think that is a good idea because 
our legislation will prevent any Presi-
dent in the future from doing that, in-
cluding this Democratic President, any 
future Democratic Presidents, any fu-
ture Republican Presidents or Inde-
pendents or anyone else. 
We don’t think that is a good idea, 
and I can’t believe that my good friend 
from Pennsylvania would just be ag-
nostic as to that proposition. 
Let me just say, finally, about the 
whole question of what is relevant and 
what is irrelevant, it seems like all we 
are hearing from the other side is em-
bodied in the big statement coming out 
of the Senate from Senator LINDSEY 
GRAHAM, saying it is time for a na-
tional Federal ban on abortion that 
could even be exceeded by the States. 
Now, originally, they said: Well, Roe 
v. Wade is settled precedent, and we ac-
cept that. 
Then, they packed the Court with 
their Justices, who were determined, 
hellbent, on overturning Roe v. Wade, 
and they did it. 
Then, we heard from our friends 
across the aisle: Well, this is a matter 
for the States. Let the States decide. 
Now, we hear from our colleagues in 
Congress that, no, they want a national 
criminal ban on the right of women to 
make their own decisions about their 
health, their families, their careers, 
and their futures. 
Then, they will even allow States to 
go beyond that to completely ban abor-
tion, which is, of course, the essential 
pro-life position which we have heard 
from our colleagues across the aisle. 
That is what they are focused on. 
Meantime, the President signed, this 
week, the Inflation Reduction Act, 
which 
will 
dramatically 
lower 
healthcare costs for tens of millions of 
Americans and, finally, overturn the 
Republican ban on the government ne-
gotiating in the Medicare program 
with Big Pharma for lower prescription 
drug prices. 
We are actually making progress. 
They want to drag everyone into their 
insatiable efforts to ban the right to 
abortion in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I will double down on 
the comment that these bills are irrel-
evant. They are absolutely irrelevant 
in that two of them are superfluous. 
One has already passed. One passed in 
an amendment to the NDAA, and the 
other one is an unprecedented grant of 
authority to the Census, which is com-
pletely inappropriate. So, yes, these 
bills, I would argue, are irrelevant. 
Do you know who would think they 
are irrelevant? Any person you talk to 
on the street. If you go up to somebody 
filling up their gas tank, and you ask 
them about these three bills, these are 
irrelevant to their lives. They are wor-
ried about the price of gas. 
If you ask somebody at a grocery 
store who is trying to feed a family 
about these bills, these bills are irrele-
vant to their grocery bill. 
If you are talking about real wages 
and fighting the loss of wages and in-
flation, these bills are irrelevant to 
that. A lot of blue-collar workers want 
wages to increase like they did under 
the last administration, not decrease 
like they are today. 
So, yes, these bills are absolutely ir-
relevant to everyday Americans. 
But let’s just talk about the high 
cost of inflation. Inflation is the top 
concern reported by businesses and 
voters alike. However, instead of work-
ing to lower costs for businesses and 
workers, the SEC proposed burdensome 
new rules requiring businesses to dis-
close extensive climate-related data 
and additional climate risks. 
That is why if we defeat the previous 
question, I will personally offer an 
amendment to the rule to immediately 
consider H.R. 8589, which would pro-
hibit the SEC’s woke climate rule from 
ever moving forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to insert the text of my amend-
ment into the RECORD, along with any 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield such time as he may con-
sume to the gentleman from the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky (Mr. BARR), 
my good friend, to explain the amend-
ment. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER) for yielding. 
I rise to oppose the previous question 
so that we can immediately consider 
Representative FRENCH HILL’s H.R. 8589 
to prohibit the Securities and Ex-
change Commission from trading its 
independence and statutory authority 
away in the name of alarmist climate 
advocacy. 
The proposed climate change rule 
from the Securities and Exchange 
Commission will further crush our 
fragile economy, and struggling fami-
lies will ultimately pay the price. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Bureau 
of Labor Statistics released the Con-
sumer Price Index numbers for the 
month of August. As has been men-
tioned already today, CPI surged to 8.3 
percent, above projections, still a 40- 
year high, showing that this inflation 
crisis is not going away anytime soon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7808 
September 14, 2022 
Americans are paying more for every-
thing, and rising prices continue to 
wreak havoc on farmers, middle-class 
families, and small businesses strug-
gling to stay afloat all across America. 
Of course, Democrats’ overspending 
for the last year and a half has pro-
duced 
excess 
demand, 
pushing 
up 
prices, but no amount of Fed tight-
ening can fix the inflationary supply- 
demand mismatch without also ad-
dressing the supply side. 
At the heart of this inflation crisis is 
the Biden administration’s war on 
American energy production. This pol-
icy of deliberately constraining the 
supply of energy is taking its toll on 
the American people. According to a 
Penn Wharton study, inflation reduced 
the purchasing power of American 
households by approximately $6,000 last 
year. That is like taking an entire pay-
check away for an entire month for 
every American household. 
Real 
earnings, 
hourly 
earnings, 
dropped 2.8 percent over the year in 
August. Wages are down because of this 
inflation crisis. Credit card debt is up. 
It hit an all-time high last month. 
One in six American households are 
now behind paying their electricity 
bills and in danger of losing their util-
ity services altogether, with natural 
gas prices up 30 percent since last July. 
Effectively, electricity prices are now 
up 15 percent, a 14-year high. 
When Joe Biden took office, the aver-
age price of gasoline was $2.36 per gal-
lon. Today, the average gas price in 
America is $3.72 per gallon, and stub-
bornly, diesel prices are much, much 
higher. That goes into everything: 
transportation, manufacturing, farm-
ers having to fill up the tank on their 
tractors. All of that is passed on at the 
retail point of sale. In less than 2 
years, America has gone from energy 
dominant to energy desperate. 
Mr. Speaker, ground zero for the 
Biden administration’s war on Amer-
ican energy is the weaponization of fi-
nancial 
regulation 
and 
the 
politicization of access to capital. 
What do I mean by this? We all know 
that the Biden administration killed 
the Keystone XL pipeline and other 
critical energy infrastructure projects. 
We know that they are frustrating the 
construction of new refineries. We 
know that they have held up 4,400 drill-
ing permits. But ground zero is the 
weaponization of financial regulation 
to deny American energy the access to 
the capital that they need to invest in 
a very capital-intensive business. 
Throughout the executive branch, at 
the Treasury Department, the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, the 
Federal Reserve, the OCC, and other fi-
nancial regulators, Biden has installed 
or nominated unelected climate alarm-
ists and given them free rein to attack 
American energy businesses, all in the 
name of climate change. 
The sad irony, Mr. Speaker, is that if 
we want to innovate and actually solve 
climate change, we wouldn’t be deny-
ing American energy companies and 
the scientists there access to financing. 
We would be giving them more financ-
ing to innovate and to solve the prob-
lem the American way, through free 
enterprise and innovation. One of these 
radical nominees even called for bank-
rupting American fossil fuel compa-
nies. 
Perhaps the most dangerous regula-
tion issued by the Biden administra-
tion to destroy American energy is the 
SEC’s climate risk disclosure rule pro-
posed in March. This 534-page mon-
strosity marks the transformation of 
the SEC from an independent agency 
dedicated to investor protection to an 
unaccountable and politicized bureauc-
racy intent on advancing radical envi-
ronmental and social policy over which 
it has neither expertise nor jurisdic-
tion. 
This proposed rule is totally discon-
nected from the longstanding investor- 
driven materiality standard and will 
politicize the agency and reduce its 
credibility by hurting investors, ele-
vating nonpecuniary factors above fi-
nancial returns, and steering retail in-
vestors into lower performing, higher 
fee, and less-diversified ESG invest-
ments. 
As a reminder, Mr. Speaker, the stat-
utory mission of the SEC is to protect 
investors; maintain fair, orderly, and 
efficient markets; and facilitate cap-
ital formation. This is not about pro-
tecting investors. It is about hurting 
investors. It is not about capital for-
mation. It is about capital destruction. 
It is definitively not to reduce carbon 
emissions or solve climate change, but 
the SEC is wading into environmental 
policy debates like climate change 
with 
its 
top-down, 
government-di-
rected, one-size-fits-all mandatory en-
vironmental, social, and governance 
disclosure regulation, or ESG. 
SEC Chair Gary Gensler claims that 
the requirements in the proposal are 
material because institutional inves-
tors are demanding this information. 
But according to a study conducted by 
the University of Chicago and FINRA, 
only 21 percent of surveyed retail in-
vestors in this country even knew what 
ESG stands for. 
The fact of the matter is, retail in-
vestors are not demanding this infor-
mation. They want returns, not poli-
tics, guiding their retirement and col-
lege savings. 
What do retail investors really care 
about? Yesterday’s bloodbath in the 
stock market when the Dow plum-
meted by over 1,000 points in a single 
day, the worst drop since June 2020. 
That tells me what investors actu-
ally want, Mr. Speaker, and it is re-
turns. They need returns. They don’t 
need an inflationary environment that 
is eating away their purchasing power 
and rising interest rates because of it 
that result in turmoil in the financial 
markets, destroying retirement sav-
ings. 
ESG funds are hurting American in-
vestors. They are tech-heavy, and in a 
market where tech stocks are in a mas-
sive sell-off and are vastly underper-
forming non-ESG funds that contain 
investments in energy, who are the los-
ers? Retail investors who are unwit-
tingly invested in and overexposed to 
ESG. On top of that, ESG funds charge 
43 percent higher fees than non-ESG 
funds. 
In short, the government is re-
directing capital away from energy, 
and it is costing retail investors, which 
include teachers, police officers, and 
other ordinary Americans saving for 
retirement, extraordinary amounts of 
money. 
But, today, Congress can actually do 
something to protect investors. I am 
leading this previous question that 
would amend the rule to immediately 
consider H.R. 8589, legislation offered 
by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
HILL), my friend, to stop this SEC rule 
in its tracks before it causes more 
damage to retail investors and to 
Americans struggling to keep up with 
unsustainable energy prices. 
Mr. Speaker, House Republicans will 
keep pushing for America to get back 
to basics. We need to deliver economic 
relief to the American people to allevi-
ate the pain of inflation. To do that, we 
need to unleash the supply side. That 
means more, not less, financing of 
American energy to lower the price at 
the pump, to reduce the cost of heating 
your home. 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, we need financial 
advisers to get back to the basics of in-
vesting. That means diversified port-
folios that include American energy, 
not just tech, because the point of in-
vesting your hard-earned money isn’t 
to further a political agenda or some 
far-left view of America that some 
woke asset manager on Wall Street 
thinks. Instead, it is to generate a fi-
nancial return that will enable you to 
send your kid to college, ensure you 
can live a comfortable life in retire-
ment, or pursue some other aspect of 
your American Dream. 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, it is about capital 
formation. It is about giving heroic 
American energy companies access to 
the capital and the financing that they 
need, not only to make energy afford-
able and reliable for the American peo-
ple but to make America competitive 
in the global economy. 
It is for all of these reasons, Mr. 
Speaker, that I urge my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to join me in 
supporting this previous question.

Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, my col-
leagues tempt me to wander afield 
from what we have come here to talk 
about since they want to talk about 
seemingly everything else. So let me 
try to respond to a few of the points 
that have just been lobbed in our direc-
tion. 
First, they seem to want to assign re-
sponsibility to the President of the 
United States for the inflation rate. 
But then, surely, they will assign re-
sponsibility to the President of the

September 14, 2022 
United States for the unemployment 
rate, which now stands at around 3.5 
percent, the lowest unemployment rate 
in 50 years. You have got to go back a 
half century to find the kind of job sit-
uation 
that 
President 
Biden 
has 
brought to the United States of Amer-
ica. 
Last week, we learned that payroll 
employment is up by 315,000 in the 
month of August alone. Since Presi-
dent Biden came into office, we have 
added 668,000 manufacturing jobs. 
Now, it is true the President has been 
fighting inflation ever since he got into 
office. Why? 
Well, the economy started to come 
roaring back—not just in America, but 
all over the world in the wake of the 
pandemic. So we saw a tremendous de-
mand with broken supply chains. So 
what happens under the law of supply 
and demand? The prices go up. But, un-
like our colleagues who seem to want 
to chortle about it and use it as a cam-
paign talking point, President Biden 
and the Democrats have been acting to 
bring inflation down. Every single day. 
Yesterday’s Consumer Price Index 
data showed continued progress in 
bringing global inflation down here in 
the U.S. economy. Gas prices are down 
an average of $1.30 a gallon since the 
beginning of the summer. Price in-
creases slowed at the grocery store this 
month. Still too high. But real wages 
went up again for a second month in a 
row, giving hardworking families more 
breathing room. 
It is amazing to me that some of the 
time has been delegated to one of our 
distinguished colleagues who seem to 
want to blame these global economic 
conditions arising from COVID–19 and 
the 
pandemic 
and 
broken 
supply 
chains, as well as Vladimir Putin’s 
filthy imperialist war in Ukraine, 
which 
fortunately, 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine, with the support of a lot of 
people in this body—but not every-
body—is starting to win. And we have 
seen dramatic reversal of fortune in 
that war as the democratic forces are 
beating Vladimir Putin and the auto-
crats in Russia. 
But in any event, we just heard 
someone who wanted to blame all of 
these global economic conditions on an 
SEC regulation, which we are not here 
to discuss and, therefore, unfortu-
nately, I can’t address. I might agree 
with the gentleman, for all I know. It 
has nothing to do with the legislation 
before us, and it is hard for me to be-
lieve that that is the source of infla-
tion around the world or the unemploy-
ment, which now is practically at the 
bottom level that we have ever seen in 
over a century. 
But in any event, Mr. Speaker, back 
to the point at hand, I thought we were 
going to be distracted with Republican 
calls to ban abortion across the coun-
try. Well, the polls must be teaching 
them something because I am not hear-
ing about abortion today. 
For many years, all I heard from 
them was abortion is murder, and the 
millions of persons who are being mur-
dered by abortion. They demanded the 
overthrow of Roe v. Wade, and they got 
their way. 
Yesterday, Senator LINDSEY GRAHAM 
introduced legislation for a national 
criminal ban on abortion. But, of 
course, the so-called pro-life forces 
want to go further in the States and 
ban it completely. A lot of them don’t 
even want to allow exceptions for rape 
or incest. 
I thought our colleagues were going 
to explain what their position really is. 
I would invite them to do so as long as 
they don’t want to talk about the leg-
islation before us today. 
Why don’t they tell us what their po-
sition on abortion is, because America 
wants to know. 
I think their position has changed 
somewhat. They are singing a some-
what different tune since the people of 
Kansas, by 20 points, destroyed their 
anti-choice agenda, and explained to 
them in numerical terms that the peo-
ple of America are on the side of free-
dom and the rights of women and men 
and families to make their own deci-
sions and not to have those decisions 
be made by LINDSEY GRAHAM, one Sen-
ator, who yesterday pronounced that 
he chose 15 weeks as the right point to 
criminalize abortion. He chose that 
himself. 
What is their position now? America 
wants to know. What is their position? 
Do they support a national criminal 
ban on abortion? Are they going to 
allow any exceptions for rape or incest? 
What is their position on it, if they 
don’t want to talk about the legisla-
tion at hand? 
Meantime, the Democrats continue 
to fight for lower drug prices, for a 
record, unprecedented, historic invest-
ment in renewable energy. 
We are addressing the problems of 
the future. At the same time, we are 
defending the integrity of the Federal 
civil service and our workforce, which 
was compromised and abused in so 
many ways by the last administration. 
We are defending the rights of whis-
tleblowers to tell the truth about what 
is taking place in terms of political 
and public corruption and not to have 
to face retaliation from their super-
visors. We are defending the institu-
tions of democracy, including the Cen-
sus, against all of the kinds of machi-
nations and corruption and political 
abuse that we saw in the last adminis-
tration. 
We are glad that the Supreme Court 
struck down their last interference 
with the Census by trying to paste 
questions outside of the rule of law on 
the short form. This legislation is de-
signed to protect the integrity of the 
Census along with the civil service, 
along with the whistleblowers. 
But as long as my dear colleagues 
and friends don’t want to talk about 
the legislation at hand, please clarify 
for America what their plan is to take 
away the health rights of American 
women and their families. Are they 
supporting the plan we heard yesterday 
announced by LINDSEY GRAHAM for a 
nationwide Federal criminal ban? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume for just a few points in rebut-
tal. 
Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing that 
inflation is a global issue, like some-
how it is not Biden’s fault and the fault 
of far-left Democrats—which it is. 
The reason why this is a global 
issue—and remind my friends on the 
other side of the aisle—is because we 
are the world’s largest GDP. We also 
just happen to be the world’s reserve 
currency. 
So, of course, when we have inflation, 
the world will have it. That is just eco-
nomics. So it is amazing how the prin-
ciples of economics are just cherry- 
picked to make points. But I would re-
mind my colleagues of those two facts. 
In short, we are exporting the infla-
tion. 
Now, as far as what we are doing to 
cause the inflation, well, it is pretty 
simple. We have injected trillions of 
dollars into the economy. That causes 
inflation. And then to double down on 
the failed policy, Joe Biden unilater-
ally, and I would argue unconstitution-
ally, canceled the debt of a swath of 
college students so you now have even 
more liquidity in the market because 
of them. 
And the sick irony here is that the 
guy that is driving the pickup truck, 
the guy that went to school to be a 
plumber, an HVAC repairman, that guy 
is now subsidizing the lawyer who is 
driving to his downtown job in a BMW. 
That is what is so perverse about what 
is happening. 
Now let’s just talk about gas prices. 
My colleague and my friend from 
Maryland said gas prices are down. 
Yeah, they are down from like a week 
ago; they are not down from January 
2021 when they were less than $2.50 a 
gallon. So let’s continue to move that 
goalpost. 
You can’t argue that gas prices are 
up. Americans know gas prices are up. 
They are feeling the pain at the pump. 
They are also feeling it in the higher 
cost of all energy and food. 
Finally, blaming Putin on gas prices 
and issues. Yeah, Putin is partially to 
blame, but who encouraged Putin to in-
vade Ukraine? That would be Joe Biden 
by his surrender of Afghanistan. 
Let me be clear that any weakness 
on the foreign stage is an indication of 
aggression. When Joe Biden showed 
weakness by abandoning the Bagram 
Air Base, by leaving our allies on the 
ground to predations of the Taliban, 
that was weakness, and Putin seized on 
that to invade Ukraine. 
Instead of giving the Ukrainians the 
MiGs they needed, the proper military 
supplies they needed, we decided to go 
halfway. Joe Biden didn’t fully com-
mit. Now we have a protracted war in 
Ukraine, which is going to lead to a hu-
manitarian crisis not only in Central

Europe but all across Africa, for exam-
ple, and higher energy prices here. 
Mr. Speaker, but that is all traced 
back to Biden being weak on foreign 
policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, let me re-
spond to my friend from Maryland on 
some of the specific points that he 
made in rebuttal to my opposition to 
the previous question. 
The gentleman says that we don’t 
want to talk about the underlying 
bills. 
What Republicans want to talk about 
is what the American people are wor-
ried about, which is rising prices. What 
we are focused on is opposing a pre-
vious question so that we could actu-
ally go and consider legislation that 
would actually help improve the record 
inflation, 40-year-high inflation that 
Americans are suffering with. 
What we are talking about is how we 
are going to lower the pain at the 
pump and lower the cost of heating 
your home, which is at a 15-year high 
in America right now. That is what Re-
publicans want to talk about; what the 
American people actually care about 
right now. 
The gentleman says that, Oh, unem-
ployment is down. 
Let me tell you the statistic that 
matters. 
It is the fact that we have 12 million 
unfilled jobs in America because the 
Democrats’ spending spree has paid 
Americans to not go to work, because 
employers in my district and every dis-
trict around the country can’t find 
labor. 
The supply-demand mismatch that 
has produced this inflation crisis is the 
result of fiscal policy errors. It is the 
result of a war on American energy 
constraining the supply of energy. It is 
because of excessive spending that has 
discouraged people to return to the 
labor force. 
So we have excess demand from over-
spending, and we have constrained 
labor supply and constrained energy 
supply, which is impounded into every-
thing and results in higher retail 
prices. 
The gentleman says that, Oh, don’t 
look here; don’t look at us; don’t look 
at the Biden administration’s war on 
energy and labor supply. No, it is not 
that. It is not the Fed that continued 
to keep interest rates too low for too 
long and flooded our money supply at a 
time when all of these fiscal policy er-
rors were going on. No, it is not that. 
It is global inflation. 
Well, why is it, then, in March of 
2021, at the precise time that this Con-
gress passed the American recovery 
plan, $2 trillion of unpaid-for spending, 
why is it then that U.S. inflation rates 
became untethered from global price 
increases? That is what happened, in 
synchronicity with their legislation. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
finally, 
he 
blames 
Vladimir Putin. 
Gas prices on the day Vladimir Putin 
invaded Ukraine were the highest in 40 
years. Inflation was over 8 percent on 
the CPI, the highest in 40 years, the 
highest since 1981 on the day Vladimir 
Putin invaded Ukraine. 
This is not about Vladimir Putin. It 
is about Americans not producing en-
ergy anymore. 
And why do we want this particular 
legislation, the legislation to block the 
SEC’s climate disclosure rule? Because 
we need more financing of American 
energy. 
Mr. Speaker, I would argue to my 
friend from Maryland, also, if the ob-
session on the other side with the cli-
mate, if that is the concern, if that is 
why we have this SEC rule, if that is 
why we have weaponized financial reg-
ulators to go after the American en-
ergy sector and redirect capital and fi-
nancing away from the American en-
ergy sector, if that is the solution to 
climate change, I want the gentleman 
to explain that to me. Because the best 
scientists in the world working on the 
issue of carbon capturing, carbon se-
questration, and harnessing the carbon 
cycle, they work at American energy 
companies. 
The answer to climate change is not 
to centralize power in Washington and 
add a thousand pages to the Federal 
Register. That will not change the 
weather. 
What 
will 
solve 
climate 
change is to solve that problem the 
American way. The American way is 
through innovation, technology, and 
science, and that means robust, free 
enterprise. That means more, not less 
capital formation. That means more fi-
nancing of American energy, more fi-
nancing of innovation. That is the Re-
publican solution to climate. 
It is also the Republican solution to 
our energy crisis and our inflation cri-
sis. That is what we are focused on, not 
these bills that the American people 
don’t care about. 
We are focused on lowering prices at 
the grocery store and at the pump and 
financing American competitiveness, 
American innovation, and American 
know-how. 
That is what we want to do. 
b 1345 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, the very 
distinguished gentleman from Ken-
tucky purported to speak for what 
Americans are worried about. Undoubt-
edly, many Americans are worried 
about inflation, which is why this ad-
ministration has been taking strong 
action not just to get jobs for every-
body who wants a job and good jobs and 
union jobs for people, but also to bring 
inflation down. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a New York Times article titled ‘‘U.S. 
Gas Prices Have Fallen for 91 Straight 
Days, a Relief for Consumers.’’ 
[From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2022] 
U.S. GAS PRICES HAVE FALLEN FOR 91 
STRAIGHT DAYS, A RELIEF FOR CONSUMERS 
(By Isabella Simonetti) 
The price of gasoline continues to fall 
steadily, easing pressure on American con-
sumers as the cost of filling a tank contin-
ued to tumble from record levels reached 
earlier in the summer. 
Gas prices fell 10.6 percent in August, 
which helped moderate still-sky-high infla-
tion, Tuesday’s Consumer Price Index report 
showed. 
The energy index, which tracks gasoline 
and electricity among other energy sources, 
dropped 5 percent last month, as electricity 
and natural gas prices rose. 
After peaking at $5.02 in June, gasoline 
prices have dropped for 91 straight days, and 
the national average stood at just over $3.70 
a gallon on Tuesday, data from AAA show. 
But analysts point to a few reasons this 
streak of declines is unlikely to continue. 
Because they’re determined by oil prices, 
gasoline prices are also susceptible to a wide 
range of challenges, like hurricanes that 
knock out drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and 
efforts to punish Russia for its invasion of 
Ukraine by curbing its ability to sell crude 
on the global market. 
While gas prices are down, the overall en-
ergy index still remains up 23.8 percent over 
the 12 months that ended in August. Elec-
tricity prices alone jumped 15.8 percent, rep-
resenting the largest 12-month increase since 
August 1981, the inflation report said. The 
jump in electricity prices is largely attrib-
utable to the high cost of natural gas, said 
Laura Rosner-Warburton, an economist at 
MacroPolicy Perspectives. 
As winter approaches, other fuel prices 
could influence inflation data. The cost of 
heating a home with natural gas, the most 
common source of home-heating fuel in the 
United States, is expected to jump more 
than 25 percent from last year, to $952 for the 
six months from October through March, ac-
cording to the National Energy Assistance 
Directors Association. 
‘‘You would expect that a hard winter 
could create a significant increase in demand 
in price of natural gas,’’ said Bryan Benoit, 
U.S. national managing partner of energy at 
Grant Thornton. ‘‘And then of course all of 
this is further exacerbated by what’s going 
on with the war in the Ukraine.’’ 
Mr. RASKIN. I want to talk about 
some of the other things that Ameri-
cans are worried about since my col-
league purported to speak for Ameri-
cans because I saw a poll recently say-
ing that Americans are worried about 
the attack on democracy and voting 
rights. 
Part of that may be the fact that 
some of our colleagues seem to be am-
bivalent about whether or not to de-
nounce the rampant violence that was 
unleashed against this institution, this 
body, on January 6, 2021, when thou-
sands of rioters came and attacked our 
officers, wounding and injuring more 
than 150 of them, breaking their jaws, 
their necks, lost fingers, strokes, heart 
attacks, concussions, and contusions. 
And, of course, the former President 
says that his mob actually greeted the 
police with hugs and kisses. 
Some of our colleagues shamefully 
have followed the former President in 
trying to whitewash the worst episode 
of domestic mass insurrectionary vio-
lence ever unleashed on the Capitol of 
the United States with an attack on 
the Vice President, Mike Pence. We 
heard those words, ‘‘Hang Mike Pence. 
Hang Mike Pence,’’ bouncing off of the 
walls of the Capitol and against the 
Congress of the United States.

So, yes, people are worried about the 
state of our democracy with so many 
members of the GOP following Donald 
Trump in not only his terrible big lie, 
the first time we have ever seen that in 
American history, but also the big lie 
encompassing this mob violence and 
this insurrection against the Govern-
ment of the United States. 
Do you know what else Americans 
are worried about, Mr. Speaker? Amer-
icans are now worried about State poli-
ticians and Federal politicians tram-
pling the rights of women. For more 
than a half century, women have had a 
right to make their most intimate pro-
creative and reproductive decisions 
with their families, with their hus-
bands, with their partners, with their 
ministers, and with their church lead-
ers. 
Then, they gerrymandered the Su-
preme Court. They kept Merrick Gar-
land off the Supreme Court by not even 
giving him a hearing over on the Sen-
ate side. 
Then, what do you know, Mr. Speak-
er? They followed what the RNC was 
asking for in all of their platforms for 
all of these years: Overturn Roe v. 
Wade. They overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Then, we heard from our colleagues: 
Well, we just want the States to decide. 
But, 
yesterday, 
Senator 
LINDSEY 
GRAHAM unveiled what the real plan is: 
a nationwide criminal ban on abortion, 
and if they can go further in the 
States, they will go further in the 
States. 
We have Republican proposals all 
over America to completely ban abor-
tion from the moment of conception, 
which is the pro-life orthodoxy, which 
is life begins at conception. 
We heard it in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. We have heard it in the Over-
sight and Reform Committee. We have 
been hearing it for years. But now they 
have fallen strangely and demurely si-
lent. Why is that? Part of it is because 
of the good people of Kansas, who 
showed them just where America is on 
this. 
America is a country committed to 
individual freedom and the rights of 
the people to make their own decisions 
and not having busybody, theocrat 
politicians in State capitals telling 
them how to make their own decisions 
about their careers, about their lives, 
about their families, and about their 
healthcare—and certainly not allowing 
LINDSEY
GRAHAM
to dictate to the 
women of America what their destiny 
will be. 
They won’t say a word about it. They 
will talk about an SEC regulation no-
body heard of that we are not here to 
talk about today. They will blame Joe 
Biden for global inflation. They will 
blame Joe Biden for Vladimir Putin’s 
filthy, imperialist invasion of Ukraine. 
I hear them denouncing Joe Biden. 
They won’t denounce Vladimir Putin 
for 1 second. 
I would happily yield 1 minute if they 
would denounce Vladimir Putin, but 
they won’t do it. We have heard people 
over on their side cheerleading for 
Vladimir Putin. I heard the gentle-
woman from Georgia say: Russia wins. 
Guess what? Russia doesn’t win. The 
people of Ukraine are winning today, 
and the people of America are with the 
people of Ukraine. We are on the side of 
democrats, small d democrats, all over 
the world against the autocrats like 
Putin, against the theocrats like peo-
ple who would dictate to the women of 
America their own health decisions. 
We are against the tyrants, the bul-
lies, and the despots. We are against 
Presidents who get into office and try 
to dictate the political decisionmaking 
of individual members of the workforce 
and try to push their ideological pro-
gram into the government. We are for 
defending whistleblowers; we are for 
defending the Census; and we are for 
defending democratic institutions in 
America. 
I am just shocked that I hear from 
my good friend from Pennsylvania, 
someone I like and someone I trust, 
that he actually is defending Putin 
against Biden and blaming Joe Biden 
for Putin’s long-running plan to invade 
Ukraine. That is a remarkable thing to 
me, and I hope we can have that clari-
fied. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I let my good friend 
from Maryland know that I like him, 
too, and I would certainly clarify the 
remarks on Putin. 
I will denounce Putin right now. Re-
member, I was the one calling in the 
beginning of this conflict for a no-fly 
zone to be established led by the 
United States. I don’t think there is 
anybody more hawkish on Russia and 
the Ukraine issue than myself on this 
side of the aisle. So, to say that I was 
up here defending Putin is ludicrous. 
We, of course, needed to beat Putin. 
We should have been much more en-
gaged from the beginning of this con-
flict, not just to send a message to the 
Russians but to send a message to the 
Iranians and a message to the Chinese 
vis-a-vis Taiwan. But I could go on. 
I 
would 
say 
it 
is 
a 
total 
mischaracterization of my position to 
say that I am up here saying good 
things about dictator Putin. 
I remind my friend from Maryland 
about the history of this building. In 
1814, it was literally burned to the 
ground. In the seventies, Puerto Rican 
separatists stormed in and detonated a 
bomb. So, let’s just get the historical 
context in place. 
As far as denouncing violence, every-
one on this side of the aisle has de-
nounced 
political 
violence 
consist-
ently. The inconsistency is from my 
friends from across the other side of 
the aisle who cherry-pick when they 
denounce political violence. 
I remember that during the entire 
summer of 2020, my friends across the 
aisle treated the destructive BLM and 
antifa protests that caused $2 billion 
worth of damage, they treated those 
protesters with kid gloves. You had the 
current Vice President paying the bail 
for the protesters. You had the gentle-
woman from New York, Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ, saying: ‘‘The whole point of 
protesting is to make people uncom-
fortable. . . . To folks who complain 
protest demands make others uncom-
fortable, that is the point.’’ Those are 
the words of the Democrats, not of us. 
We could go on. 
Chris Cuomo, CNN host: ‘‘Please, 
show me where it says protesters are 
supposed to be polite and peaceful.’’ 
The last time I checked, that was a 
Democrat. 
New York BLM cofounder Hawk 
Newsome said in response to Eric 
Adams trying to put plainclothes po-
lice officers on the street: ‘‘There will 
be riots; there will be fire; and there 
will be bloodshed.’’ 
It sounds to me that the political vi-
olence and the support for the rhetoric 
that is coming to support political vio-
lence and upheaval are coming from 
one side of the aisle, the Democrat side 
of the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. BARR) 
for more rebuttal. 
Mr. BARR. We may have found a 
point of bipartisan agreement that we 
all dislike Vladimir Putin. But one of 
the main reasons why Vladimir Putin 
was able to invade Ukraine was the re-
moval 
of 
deterrence: 
unilaterally 
waiving sanctions on Nord Stream 2, 
refusing to respond for a full year of a 
buildup, inviting aggression by retreat-
ing from Afghanistan, and signaling to 
our allies that we are not coming to 
help you. That might be one of the rea-
sons why we have a problem with 
Vladimir Putin right now. 
To the gentleman from Maryland’s 
argument that we are just purporting 
to speak for all Americans, we are the 
Representatives of the American peo-
ple, and we are their only voice in this 
Chamber. I am not purporting to speak 
for Americans. I am telling you what 
my constituents in Kentucky are tell-
ing me. 
Charlie from Fleming County says 
that he can’t afford to fill up his trac-
tor as a farmer because diesel prices 
are where they are. He says: I don’t 
know where they get their numbers in 
Washington, Congressman, but it feels 
three times 8 percent on the CPI. 
Lorna from Mount Sterling, Ken-
tucky, owns a floral business, a Main 
Street small business, and everything 
costs more. She said: This is not the 
America I know. 
Then, Jamie, who is a mom of two 
kids, she goes to get baby formula. She 
goes to the grocery, and she can’t af-
ford groceries. She tries to fill up her 
car to take her kids on errands, and 
she can’t afford it. 
This is not purporting to speak for 
the American people. These are the 
American people, and they are suf-
fering because this administration will 
not fix the supply side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7812 
September 14, 2022 
They raise taxes on businesses, which 
discourages business investment and 
capital expenditures that we need to 
fix the supply bottlenecks. They raise 
prices at the pump by declaring war on 
American 
energy 
production 
by 
weaponizing financial regulation. They 
refuse to take actions that actually 
will solve the supply problem by en-
couraging people to go back to work. 
We don’t need to be discouraging peo-
ple from going back to work. We need 
to fill those 12 million unfilled jobs 
right now by encouraging productivity 
and American people going back to 
work. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat the previous question so that we 
can go to some legislation that would 
actually help lower prices, what the 
American people do care about, not 
what they purport to care about, what 
they tell us they care about, and that 
is lowering prices. 
This bill would help us do that be-
cause it would unlock the financing we 
need to make America energy domi-
nant once again and lower prices across 
the board. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, I have no further speakers. I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, 
the CPI just released yesterday shows 
that prices have increased 8.3 percent 
from August of last year. Real wages 
are down 2.8 percent. The cost of elec-
tricity has skyrocketed 15.8 percent. 
That is the most since 1981, the most 
since I was alive. 
As of August, nearly one quarter of 
all Americans reported forgoing basic 
needs like food and medicine just to be 
able to afford their energy bill. This 
number will only get worse because we 
are going to face even higher costs to 
heat our homes this winter, with nat-
ural gas prices nearing a 14-year high. 
Yet, Democrats want to focus their 
efforts on, again, I would call it, irrele-
vant 
legislation 
that 
has 
already 
passed the House. It will not provide 
any relief to American workers and 
American families. 
For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and to vote ‘‘no’’ on the rule. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from 
Kentucky spoke about what his con-
stituents are interested in. Apparently, 
they are interested only in the ques-
tion of inflation. 
My constituents are interested in 
that and are satisfied about the fact 
that we have had more than 90 days of 
decline in gas prices and that this ad-
ministration is fighting to reduce in-
flation, including with the Inflation 
Reduction Act, which dramatically re-
duces healthcare costs, saying that no-
body will have to spend more than $35 
a month on insulin—no diabetic in 
America—and no one in the Medicare 
program will have to spend more than 
$2,000 a year on prescription drugs, gen-
erally. 
How is that for getting inflation 
down? 
But that is not all they care about. 
They care about women’s right to 
choose and the GOP assault on the 
freedoms of the people, something 
which our colleagues maintain their 
demure 
and 
uncharacteristic 
cir-
cumspect silence about today. They 
didn’t want to talk about this new GOP 
plan to ban abortion all across Amer-
ica. That is what we heard yesterday 
from Senator GRAHAM about his plan 
for America. 
My constituents want freedom in 
America. They want democracy in vot-
ing rights. They don’t want to see vio-
lence unleashed against the Capitol of 
the 
United 
States, 
against 
school 
boards, against State capitols, or any 
of the political violence we have seen 
from whatever source. I am happy to 
denounce all of it. 
I wish my colleagues would denounce 
political violence when it comes to our 
very doors, when it enters this Cham-
ber, rather than playing follow the 
leader with the former President who 
has disgraced himself as the first Presi-
dent in U.S. history to be impeached 
twice and continues to be embroiled in 
all the political corruption investiga-
tions all over the country, as it has 
been shown that he egged on armed 
protesters to come to try to attack 
this body, to drive Vice President 
Pence out of the body, and to drive us 
out of the body, as well, interfering 
with a Federal proceeding. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this rule and the previous question. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1339 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 13. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the bill (H.R. 
8589) to prohibit the Securities and Exchange 
Commission from finalizing the proposed 
rule titled ‘‘The Enhancement and Standard-
ization of Climate-Related Disclosures for 
Investors’’. All points of order against con-
sideration of the bill are waived. The bill 
shall be considered as read. All points of 
order against provisions in the bill are 
waived. The previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and on any 
amendment thereto to final passage without 
intervening motion except: (1) one hour of 
debate equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Financial Services; and (2) 
one motion to recommit. 
SEC. 14. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not 
apply to the consideration of H.R. 8589. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the res-
olution. 
b 1400 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TONKO). The question is on ordering the 
previous question. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Mr. Speak-
er, on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on ordering the previous 
question will be followed by 5-minute 
votes on: 
Adoption of the resolution, if or-
dered; 
En bloc motion to suspend the rules, 
if offered; and 
Motions to suspend the rules and 
pass: 
H.R. 884; 
H.R. 5774; 
S. 2293; and 
S. 442. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 213, nays 
206, not voting 13, as follows:

gency; and 
‘‘(2) the Secretary determines is an emer-
gency for purposes of the laws administered 
by the Secretary. 
‘‘§ 3602. Continuation of educational assist-
ance benefits during emergency situations 
‘‘(a) AUTHORITY.—If the Secretary deter-
mines under subsection (c) that an individual 
is negatively affected by an emergency situ-
ation, the Secretary may provide edu-
cational assistance to that individual under 
the laws administered by the Secretary as if 
such negative effects did not occur. The au-
thority under this section is in addition to 
the other authorities of the Secretary to pro-
vide benefits in emergency situations, but in

than a total of four weeks of additional edu-
cational assistance by reason of any other 
such authority and this section. 
‘‘(b) HOUSING
AND
ALLOWANCES.—In pro-
viding educational assistance to an indi-
vidual pursuant to subsection (a), the Sec-
retary may— 
‘‘(1) continue to pay a monthly housing sti-
pend under chapter 33 of this title, during a 
month the individual would have been en-
rolled in a program of education or training 
but for the emergency situation at the same 
rate such stipend would have been payable if 
the individual had not been negatively af-
fected by the emergency situation, except 
that the total number of weeks for which sti-
pends may continue to be so payable may 
not exceed four weeks; and 
‘‘(2) continue to pay payments or subsist-
ence allowances under chapters 30, 31, 32, 33, 
and 35 of this title and chapter 1606 of title 
10 during a month for a period of time that 
the individual would have been enrolled in a 
program of education or training but for the 
emergency situation, except that the total 
number of weeks for which payments or al-
lowances may continue to be so payable may 
not exceed four weeks. 
‘‘(c) 
DETERMINATION
OF
NEGATIVE
EF-
FECTS.—The Secretary shall determine that 
an individual was negatively affected by an 
emergency situation if—

program of education of an educational in-
stitution or enrolled in training at a training 
establishment and is pursuing such program 
or training using educational assistance 
under the laws administered by the Sec-
retary; 
‘‘(2) the educational institution or training 
establishment certifies to the Secretary that 
such program or training is truncated, de-
layed, relocated, canceled, partially can-
celed, converted from being on-site to being 
offered by distance learning, or otherwise 
modified or made unavailable by reason of 
the emergency situation; and 
‘‘(3) the Secretary determines that the 
modification to such program or training 
specified under paragraph (2) would reduce 
the amount of educational assistance (in-
cluding with respect to monthly housing sti-
pends, payments, or subsistence allowances) 
that would be payable to the individual but 
for the emergency situation. 
‘‘(d) EFFECT
ON ENTITLEMENT PERIOD.—If 
the Secretary determines that an individual 
who received assistance under this section 
did not make progress toward the comple-
tion of the program of education in which 
the individual is enrolled during the period 
for which the individual received such assist-
ance, any assistance provided pursuant to 
this section shall not be counted for purposes 
of determining the total amount of an indi-
vidual’s entitlement to educational assist-
ance, housing stipends, or payments or sub-
sistence allowances under chapters 30, 31, 32, 
and 35 of this title and chapter 1606 of title 
10. 
‘‘§ 3603. Continuation of educational assist-
ance benefits for certain programs of edu-
cation converted to distance learning by 
reason of emergency situations 
‘‘In the case of a program of education ap-
proved by a State approving agency, or the 
Secretary when acting in the role of a State 
approving agency, that is converted from 
being offered on-site at an educational insti-
tution or training establishment to being of-
fered by distance learning by reason of an 
emergency or health-related situation, as de-
termined by the Secretary, the Secretary 
may continue to provide educational assist-
ance under the laws administered by the Sec-
retary without regard to such conversion, in-
cluding with respect to paying any— 
‘‘(1) monthly housing stipends under chap-
ter 33 of this title; or 
‘‘(2) payments or subsistence allowances 
under chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of this title

tution and modification of courses by rea-
son of emergency situation

ment of educational assistance described in 
subsection (b) shall not— 
‘‘(1) be charged against any entitlement to 
educational assistance of the individual con-
cerned; or 
‘‘(2) be counted against the aggregate pe-
riod for which section 3695 of this title limits 
the receipt of educational assistance by such 
individual. 
‘‘(b) EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE DESCRIBED.— 
Subject to subsection (d), the payment of 
educational assistance described in this sub-
section is the payment of such assistance to 
an individual for pursuit of a course or pro-
gram of education at an educational institu-
tion under chapter 30, 31, 32, 33, or 35 of this 
title or chapter 1606 of title 10, if the Sec-
retary determines that the individual— 
‘‘(1) was unable to complete such course or 
program as a result of— 
‘‘(A) the closure of the educational institu-
tion, or the full or partial cancellation of a 
course or program of education, by reason of 
an emergency situation; or 
‘‘(B) the disapproval of the course or a 
course that is a necessary part of that pro-
gram under this chapter because the course 
was modified by reason of such emergency; 
and 
‘‘(2) did not receive credit or lost training 
time, toward completion of the program of 
education being so pursued. 
‘‘(c) HOUSING ASSISTANCE.—In this section,

‘‘(2) payments or subsistence allowances 
under chapters 30, 31, 32, and 35 of this title 
and chapter 1606 of title 10 during a month 
the individual would have been enrolled in a 
course or program of education. 
‘‘(d) PERIOD NOT CHARGED.—The period for 
which, by reason of this section, educational 
assistance is not charged against entitle-
ment or counted toward the applicable ag-
gregate period under section 3695 of this title 
shall not exceed the aggregate of— 
‘‘(1) the portion of the period of enrollment 
in the course from which the individual did 
not receive credit or with respect to which 
the individual lost training time, as deter-
mined under subsection (b)(2); and 
‘‘(2) the period by which a monthly stipend 
is extended under section 3680(a)(2)(B) of this 
title. 
‘‘(e) CONTINUING PURSUIT OF DISAPPROVED 
COURSES.—(1) The Secretary may treat a 
course of education that is disapproved 
under this chapter as being approved under 
this chapter with respect to an individual de-
scribed in paragraph (2) if the Secretary de-
termines, on a programmatic basis, that— 
‘‘(A) such disapproval is the result of an 
action described in subsection (b)(1)(B); and 
‘‘(B) continuing pursuing such course is in 
the best interest of the individual. 
‘‘(2) An individual described in this para-
graph is an individual who is pursuing a 
course of education at an educational insti-
tution under chapter 30, 31, 32, 33, or 35 of 
this title or chapter 1606 of title 10, as of the

education and was receiving educational as-
sistance under chapter 33 of this title or sub-
sistence allowance under chapter 31 of this 
title, and for whom the Secretary makes a 
determination under subsection (b), the indi-
vidual shall be treated as an individual en-
rolled in a program of education on a full- 
time basis for the purpose of calculating 
monthly housing stipends payable under 
chapter 33 of this title, or subsistence allow-
ance payable under chapter 31 of this title, 
for any month the individual is enrolled in 
the program of education on a part-time 
basis to complete any course of education 
that was partially or fully canceled by rea-
son of the emergency situation. 
‘‘(g) NOTICE OF CLOSURES.—Not later than 5 
business days after the date on which the 
Secretary receives notice that an edu-
cational institution will close or is closed by 
reason of an emergency situation, the Sec-
retary shall provide to each individual who 
is enrolled in a course or program of edu-
cation at such educational institution using 
entitlement to educational assistance under 
chapter 30, 31, 32, 33, or 35 of this title, or 
chapter 1606 of title 10 notice of— 
‘‘(1) such closure and the date of such clo-
sure; and

vidual’s entitlement to educational assist-
ance pursuant to this section.

vidual who withdraws from a program of

RECOGNIZING CONGRESSMAN HAL 
ROGERS 
AS 
DEAN 
OF 
THE 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, 
I had the honor of introducing Alaska’s 
newly elected Representative after she 
took her oath of office. 
Representative PELTOLA makes his-
tory in joining the House, and we are 
very glad to have her. The seat to 
which she was elected, however, be-
came vacant because of an event for 
which we are all very, very saddened. 
The passing of our friend, a great 
friend of this institution, Representa-
tive Don Young, marked the end of an 
era for this House. 
Don was a repository of institutional 
knowledge and a keeper of the House’s 
traditions. He was our dean, the most 
senior Member of either party. 
Today, as we reflect upon that loss 
for the House, for Alaska, and for all of 
us who were his friends, we recognize a 
new dean to succeed Don in that role. I 
join the Republican leader in congratu-
lating Representative HAL ROGERS. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. ROGERS
of Ken-
tucky has achieved that distinction to 
become our new dean of the House. It is 
humbling to think that our dean is 
from the same freshman class as I am. 
He was here just shy of 5 months before 
me, as does the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH). When we arrived 
here, we met the dean of the House, 
Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, who 
served in the House 122 years. I don’t 
want to offend anyone from Mis-
sissippi. I know it was short of that 
time, but it was a long time. 
Mr. Whitten had been elected first in 
1941. He, himself, came to the office 
when the dean of the House had been 
elected in 1907, and the person who had 
been dean at that time was elected in 
1879, which is to say there aren’t a lot 
of deans of the House. And the day that 
Member ended as freshman, Abraham 
Lincoln was first sworn in as President 
of the United States. Fewer deans, by 
far, than Presidents of the United 
States. 
So we are connected to the 37th Con-
gress of the United States and the Lin-
coln Presidency by just four individual 
Members’ span of service. 
HAL ROGERS now inherits the title 
once held by former President John 
Quincy Adams, Speaker Sam Rayburn, 
and my dear friend, DEBBIE DINGELL’s 
husband, John Dingell. 
Those of us who know HAL can tes-
tify to the respect and love he has for 
this institution and for the role of 
dean. He will surely uphold its tradi-
tions and continue to carry forward 
this chain of history for the House and 
for our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate 
the dean of the House, HAL ROGERS of 
Kentucky. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCARTHY), Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. And 
as you spoke, you are runner-up, al-
most, to the dean, too, so I appreciate 
your service. 
Before I begin, I do want to take a 
moment to recognize and talk about 
our former Member, Don Young. He 
took this job very seriously, and he is 
greatly missed. 
And to the new dean, there are some 
similarities to you and Don. You both 
had your assigned seats. Don was in the 
back, but you are up front. 
Don was a yeller. You are more of a 
southern gentleman. Don preferred a 
knife in his boot. You just like cigars, 
which I think is a little improvement. 
Mr. Speaker, I have known HAL for 
the 15 years I have been here. I don’t 
know of another person that has a 
greater respect for this institution or 
is more caring for Members on both 
sides of the aisle. 
I have watched HAL in a position of 
power, as chair of the Appropriations 
Committee, work with people on the 
other side simply because the issue was 
right. I watched him defy his party, to 
stand up to do what is right. 
I have traveled with him throughout 
his district, which is not a wealthy dis-
trict at all, but I watched him, no mat-
ter how many years he has served, to 
continue to have the ability to listen. 
I watched him be on the forefront of 
watching an opioid epidemic in Amer-
ica and him leading to do something 
about it, simply because he watched 
something in his district. 
If you haven’t ever had a moment of 
time—if 
you 
get 
Representatives 
WOMACK or COLE to step aside—take a 
moment and sit with HAL. He might 
speak soft and at times he is hard of 
hearing, 
especially 
when 
he 
goes 
through the magnetometers, but he 
will tell you stories that a historian 
would love. He will tell you the times 
before of what this body would do to-
gether. He will tell you the moments of 
the highs and the lows, and all of them 
would end in a story with America 
being a little better for tomorrow. 
Now, HAL, I know the first question 
you are going to ask me. No, you get 
no more extra pay for being the dean, 
but you have a lot of responsibility, 
and, in essence, you are the mentor to 
the House. I know you will do your job 
well because all you have ever wanted 
to do was do what was right. 
Your love for the institution, your 
love for the body, but more impor-
tantly, your love for the country. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
each will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I rise in strong support of H.R. 2988, 
the Whistleblower Protection Improve-
ment Act of 2021. In May 2021, I intro-
duced the Whistleblower Protection 
Improvement Act, along with Rep-
resentative 
NANCY
MACE, 
ranking 
member of the Civil Rights and Civil 
Liberties Subcommittee. 
Federal whistleblowers serve a crit-
ical role by shedding a light on govern-
ment corruption, waste, fraud, and 
abuse and wrongdoing, often through 
reporting such actions to Congress. 
Their disclosures protect taxpayers’ 
dollars, improve Federal programs, and 
even save lives. Unfortunately, the 
Oversight Committee has seen too 
many examples of employers retali-
ating against whistleblowers. In one in-
stance, the TSA, the Transportation 
Security Administration, that provides 
security at airports, moved an airport 
employee hundreds of miles away to a 
new duty station when they revealed 
security flaws at the TSA at the air-
ports. 
In another troubling example, a 
White House supervisor moved files be-
yond the reach of a disabled employee 
after the employee disclosed violations 
of security clearance procedures. 
A GAO report earlier this year also 
revealed that employees at four sci-
entific research agencies did not report 
instances of political interference in 
scientific decisionmaking out of fear of 
retaliation and uncertainty of how to 
best voice their concerns. 
As these examples make clear, whis-
tleblowers often make disclosures at 
great personal risk. That is why pro-
tections for whistleblowers have long 
received bipartisan support in this Con-
gress. I thank my colleagues, including 
Representative MACE, for continuing 
that tradition today. 
The Whistleblower Protection Im-
provement Act would enact long-over-
due reforms to protect whistleblowers 
from retaliation to the greatest extent 
possible, and to provide meaningful 
remedies if whistleblowers still en-
counter retaliation. 
The bill would prohibit agencies from 
launching 
retaliatory 
investigations 
against employees who blow the whis-
tle and would limit the public disclo-
sure of a whistleblower’s identity. 
The bill would also provide Federal 
whistleblowers with faster legal re-
course for retaliation claims and would 
allow them to have their claims tried 
before a jury in a Federal District 
Court. Access to jury trials has long 
been a priority of whistleblower advo-
cates. 
The last major reform to whistle-
blower protection was in 2012. I am 
proud to continue this important bi-
partisan effort to protect whistle-
blowers today. 
The bill we are considering also clari-
fies that whistleblowers who prevail 
are entitled to recover attorney’s fees 
and to receive the necessary relief to 
make them whole. 
Finally, the bill would make clear 
that no Federal employee, including 
the President or the Vice President of 
the U.S., may interfere or retaliate 
against a whistleblower for disclosing 
information to Congress. 
The Whistleblower Protection Im-
provement Act has received public sup-
port from more than 100 stakeholder 
organizations, including the Govern-
ment Accountability Project, the Na-
tional Taxpayers Union, the Project on 
Government Oversight, the Taxpayer 
Protection 
Alliance, 
and 
Whistle-
blowers of America. 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD a 
letter of support from 100 different or-
ganizations. 
JULY 14. 2022. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SPEAKER
PELOSI: During the last 
month, our nation has been fixated on evi-
dence about threats to our democracy ex-
posed in the January 6 Select Committee 
hearings. 
The 
undersigned 
organizations 
commend your leadership creating the Janu-
ary 6 Committee for exposing the truth. The 
undersigned organizations now seek your 
leadership protecting those who provide the 
evidence. 
The Committee on Oversight and Reform 
has marked up HR 6762. the Whistleblower 
Protection Improvement Act (WPIA). The 
legislation deserves floor time for a House 
vote so that we can highlight its passage on 
July 30. 2022, National Whistleblower Appre-
ciation Day. The House has voted for this re-
form in the Protect Our Democracy Act. but 
Senate action requires standalone legisla-
tion. 
The WPIA would be the fifth generation of 
pioneering whistleblower rights first passed 
in 1978. These rights have been excellent 
global pacesetters that Congress unani-
mously has reaffirmed three time since 1978, 
the last in the Whistleblower Protection En-
hancement Act of 2012. The two Achilles 
heels, however, have been loopholes and lack 
of credible due process enforcement. 
Those problems only have become worse 
since 2012. For example, the administrative 
Merit Systems Protection Board has a mo-
nopoly on enforcement. but its vulnerability 
to political pressure blocked confirmations 
and led to an empty Board with a 3,500 case 
back log. Lacking judicial independence, its 
Administrative Judges who conduct hearings 
rule against whistleblowers in over 95% of 
initial merits decisions. 
The WPIA addresses both the loopholes 
and due process gaps by providing parity for 
federal civil service employee whistleblower 
rights with those enacted by Congress 16 
times in each or 17 private sector whistle-
blower law enacted since 2002. To illustrate 
it would— 
Permit jury trials if there is no timely ad-
ministrative decision. This would take the 
politics out of whistleblowerjustice for fed-
eral employees the nation’s only major labor 
group denied a day in court to challenge vio-
lation of their free speech rights despite 
making the disclosures most significant for 
voters. 
Permit lawsuits when retaliatory inves-
tigations are opened. Investigations are a 
kneejerk first reaction to find any dirt on 
whistleblowers that will distract from gov-
ernment fraud, waste and abuse. As long as a 
probe is open, it has a broad chilling effect 
even if later dropped. This key provision 
would establish parity with all other whis-
tleblower laws, even the Military Whistle-
blower Protection Act. 
Establish realistic legal burdens to obtain 
temporary relief. Temporary relief is almost 
never available under current law and is es-
sential when cases commonly drag out over 
five years. By that time, even winning may 
be too late for those who have lost their 
homes, gone bankrupt frequently lost their 
families and had their professional deputa-
tions irrevocably ruined. 
Close loopholes that erase the law’s bene-
fits. Currently, Public Health Service (PHS) 
whistleblowers are excluded from the Whis-
tleblower Protection Act and limited to 
military remedies, as are employees of the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency 
(NOAA). However, these are the professionals 
from whom we need the truth about public 
health threats like the pandemic and envi-
ronmental threats like climate change. 
Loopholes in remedies mean that whistle-
blowers still can ‘‘lose by winning.’’ The 
WPIA fills these and similar gaps. 
This legislation is a political opportunity 
supported by 86% of likely voters in a Marist 
Poll survey just before the last election, and 
more than 265 organizations across the issue 
and political spectrum have already ex-
pressed support for its passage. It extends 
the same rights to federal employees defend-
ing the public that Congress repeatedly has 
provided to corporate employees defending 
the shareholders. We need your leadership, 
so that those who defend the public can de-
fend themselves.

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this bill and to support the he-
roes and heroines who disclose wrong-
doing and corruption in our govern-
ment, leading to reforms to make our 
government stronger and better able to 
serve the American people. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1615 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I will admit the Whistle-
blower Protection Improvement Act 
has a great name because Congress 
cares about protecting whistleblowers. 
As the ranking member of the Over-
sight Committee, I appreciate and 
value whistleblowers’ service and sac-
rifice to make government better. 
In fact, ensuring whistleblowers have 
protections against abuse or retalia-
tion is a bipartisan issue here in Con-
gress. That probably explains why 
there are already so many protections 
that whistleblowers have access to in 
statutes, regulations, executive orders, 
and agency policies. There is the Whis-
tleblower Protection Act, the Intel-
ligence Community Whistleblower Pro-
tection Act, the Whistleblower Protec-
tion Enhancement Act, the very catchy 
Notification and Federal Employee 
Antidiscrimination 
and 
Retaliation 
Act. 
Congress has consistently sought to 
protect people working in the Federal 
Government who report waste, fraud, 
and abuse—and for good reason. Whis-
tleblowers are often the only means of 
knowing what is happening in an agen-
cy, and that is especially important 
under the Biden administration when 
the Democrats in Congress have re-
fused to conduct any meaningful or se-
rious oversight. 
But how many more whistleblower 
laws do we need with so many already 
on the books? 
Further, Republicans oppose this bill 
because it is a step too far. A simple 
version of this bill would have just ap-
plied the existing whistleblower pro-
tections to the few corners of the Fed-
eral Government that aren’t already 
covered by the law. However, H.R. 2988 
goes much further by making it nearly 
impossible—and only after a long, ex-
pensive process—to address perform-
ance or employment issues in anyone 
claiming to be a whistleblower, even if 
the person is not really a whistleblower 
but just bad at his or her job. 
In the real world, if you are under-
mining your boss, participating in mis-
conduct, or just lazy, your employer 
has options to hold you accountable. In 
the Federal Government, if you claim 
you are a whistleblower, you can be as 
terrible as you want and almost any 
attempt to remove you from your sta-
tion is characterized as retaliation. 
There is a difference between retalia-
tion and plain repercussions, but this 
bill would make them the same. It 
would prohibit opening an investiga-
tion into someone who claims to be a 
whistleblower, even if there is good 
reason to investigate the employee’s 
conduct. 
Under this bill, it would be nearly 
impossible to reveal the identity of a 
whistleblower in order to evaluate the 
validity of his or her claims. 
In large part, this bill is just an ex-
cuse to further idolize the people who 
pushed the sham impeachment against 
former President Trump. The actions 
of President Trump were, of course, 
vindicated by the Senate. 
Entrenching 
Federal 
Government 
employees by enacting laws like H.R. 
2988 is, in large part, why President 
Trump got elected in the first place: to 
drain the swamp. Democrats may be 
wise to remember this concern of the 
American people and stop working to 
further entrench the executive branch 
bureaucracy. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), the distinguished chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Government Op-
erations. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I thank 
the distinguished chairwoman of our 
committee for yielding time. 
I hardly think President Donald 
Trump drained the swamp. He filled it 
with alligators. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2988, 
the Whistleblower Protection Improve-
ment Act. I am committed to pro-
tecting, supporting, and empowering 
our 2.1 million civil servants to use 
their acumen and expertise to do what 
is right for the country. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Government Operations, I am inti-
mately familiar with how whistle-
blowers and the inspector general com-
munity protect our government’s most 
valuable asset, the Federal workforce. 
The Whistleblower Protection Im-
provement Act would bolster whistle-
blower protections, ensure due process 
and equitable relief, and expand protec-
tions for more Federal employees. The 
bill clarifies that no one may interfere 
with a Federal employee’s right to pro-
vide information to Congress, including 
the President of the United States. 
During the Trump Presidency, we 
saw repeated and consistent efforts to 
silence and retaliate against brave 
whistleblowers. In May, the Depart-
ment of Defense IG found that Trump 
loyalists retaliated against Colonel 
Yevgeny Vindman, who bravely re-
ported that President Trump had an 
unlawful phone call with Ukrainian 
President Zelenskyy. 
Even in the wake of a damning im-
peachment trial, and in full view of the 
public, Mr. Trump felt emboldened to 
attack Active Duty servicemembers 
who had the courage and common 
sense to expose that extortion. 
Federal employees must feel safe and 
supported when rooting out waste, 
fraud, abuse, and corruption. We must 
celebrate expertise and adherence to 
principles of law, transparency, and de-
liberation that serve as the foundation 
of our democratic system. We must 
protect public servants and defend the 
Federal merit system against partisan 
interference. 
I thank the chair of the Oversight 
Committee, Mrs. MALONEY, for spon-
soring this bill and for always lifting 
up the subcommittee’s work on whis-
tleblowers and inspectors general. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Committee 
on Transportation and Infrastructure’s 
Subcommittee on Highways and Tran-
sit. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Chair, I thank my 
good friend, the chair of our com-
mittee, for yielding time. 
I come to speak in strong support of 
the Whistleblower Protection Improve-
ment Act, of which I am a cosponsor. I 
especially appreciate this bill since, as 
a Member of Congress for the District 
of Columbia, many Federal employees 
are my constituents. 
Importantly, this bill would expand 
whistleblower protections and ensure 
due process and enable relief for whis-
tleblowers. We should appreciate and 
celebrate our Federal employees, espe-
cially our whistleblowers, and I am 
particularly 
pleased 
that 
this 
bill 
would clarify that Federal employees 
cannot be retaliated against for shar-
ing information with Congress. 
It is important that Congress have 
full information about the operations

of our government, and this good-gov-
ernance measure will help with that 
goal. 
I am grateful to Chairwoman MALO-
NEY for introducing this important bill, 
and I am pleased to speak in support of 
it. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, there are no more 
speakers, and I am prepared to close if 
my colleagues on the Republican side 
are ready to close, as well. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, whistle-
blowers in the Federal Government are 
covered by some of the most com-
prehensive protections for employees 
in the country. 
Whistleblowers serve a valuable role 
in our government, especially in an ad-
ministration like the Biden adminis-
tration, which is subject to almost no 
oversight by Congress. 
But giving this bill a great title, 
Whistleblower 
Protection 
Improve-
ment Act, does not and should not pro-
vide cover for the actual requirements 
and consequences of this bill. Bill titles 
don’t govern our government, but the 
substance within them does. 
The Whistleblower Protection Im-
provement Act is a step too far and 
would help further entrench Federal 
Government employees in their jobs. 
Mr. Chair, I oppose H.R. 2988, and I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. Chair, this bill does not prohibit 
agencies 
from 
investigating 
actual 
misconduct. 
It 
merely 
prohibits 
launching an investigation as retalia-
tion for blowing the whistle. 
When an agency becomes aware of a 
disclosure of waste, fraud, and abuse, 
the concern of the agency should be ad-
dressing those issues rather than re-
taliating against the employee who dis-
closes the problems. 
This change fills a critical role cre-
ated by the 2020 appeals court decision 
that held that current whistleblower 
laws only prohibit a retaliatory inves-
tigation if the investigation ultimately 
resulted in a significant change in the 
employee’s working conditions. This 
decision ignored the effect that a retal-
iatory investigation has on a whistle-
blower when an investigation is going 
on. So, I disagree with the gentleman’s 
statement, and I am now prepared to 
close. 
Mr. Chair, I want to stress the ur-
gency and importance of this legisla-
tion and talk about how important it is 
to protect our whistleblowers. 
They play a critical role in exposing 
wrongdoing within the government, 
sometimes at great personal risk. They 
need to be able to alert agency leaders 
and Congress without fear of retalia-
tion. 
Passing H.R. 2988 would help give 
whistleblowers the protection they de-
serve. The key reforms in the bill 
would prohibit agencies from launching 
retaliatory investigations and extend 
whistleblowers the right to a jury trial, 
which they have long sought, and per-
mit whistleblowers to receive attorney 
fees if they win their lawsuits. 
This bill establishes new protections 
for whistleblowers who have a crucial 
role in shedding light on government 
corruption and wrongdoing. 
This bill is also strongly supported 
by well over 100 stakeholder organiza-
tions. Just today, the National Tax-
payers Union announced its inclusion 
of this bill as one of its ‘‘No Brainers’’ 
list for bills that Congress should pass. 
Only a few bills receive this kind of 
recognition. This is landmark legisla-
tion, both for freedom of speech and for 
government accountability. 
I thank my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who have cosponsored this 
important legislation and spoken in 
support of it. Mr. Chair, I strongly urge 
my colleagues to vote in favor of this 
bill. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. All time for gen-
eral debate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 5- 
minute rule. 
The amendment in the nature of a 
substitute recommended by the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform print-
ed in the bill, modified by the amend-
ment printed in part B of House Report 
117–464, shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as an original bill for purpose of 
further amendment under the 5-minute 
rule and shall be considered as read. 
The text of the committee amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute is as 
follows:

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1339, the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY) and the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER) each will con-
trol 10 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amend-
ments en bloc. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
woman KATIE PORTER would require in-
spectors general to report in their 
semiannual reports the number of 
times their office was not able to re-
solve a whistleblower retaliation com-
plaint within 8 months of receiving 
that complaint. This requirement en-
sures 
that 
inspectors 
general 
are 
promptly investigating whistleblower 
retaliation complaints. 
The next amendment, offered by Con-
gressman JAKE AUCHINCLOSS, would re-
quire the Government Accountability 
Office to examine and report on whis-
tleblower protection actions, including 
the timeliness with which the Merit 
Systems Protection Board issues rul-
ings on whistleblower complaints, how 
often individuals choose a jury trial, 
and recommendations to improve the 
claim review process. 
b 1630 
This requirement evaluates whether 
the whistleblower review process is ef-
fective and identifies areas for im-
provement. 
The amendment offered by Congress-
woman SHEILA JACKSON LEE would re-
quire inspectors general to maintain a 
mechanism to receive anonymous whis-
tleblower reports. In certain instances, 
this offers the protection and comfort a 
whistleblower needs to report govern-
ment abuses and corruption. 
The next amendment, offered by Con-
gresswoman 
ABIGAIL
SPANBERGER, 
would enable whistleblowers, outside 
the intelligence community, to appeal 
adverse security clearance actions to 
the Merit Systems Protection Board. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
adopt this commonsense package of 
amendments, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I rise to op-
pose the amendments en bloc. I rise in 
opposition to the en bloc package of 
amendments offered by Chairwoman 
MALONEY. 
This package contains an amendment 
offered 
by 
Representative 
AUCHINCLOSS, which would require the 
Government Accountability Office to 
conduct a study of whistleblower com-
plaints ruled on by the Merit Systems 
Protection 
Board 
and 
make 
rec-
ommendations about the whistleblower 
review process. 
The problem with this amendment is 
that the MSPB’s Office of General 
Counsel already performs the oversight 
functions for the MSPB under the In-
spector General Act of 1978. This office 
is capable of doing the work the 
amendment would task to the GAO. 
Reviewing the MSPB determinations 
and monitoring the Federal courts is 
not a smart use of the GAO’s limited 
resources. The GAO needs to remain fo-
cused on pending statutorily mandated 
work. 
I also oppose the amendment offered 
by Representative JACKSON Lee, which 
is trying to help inspectors general of-
fices receive anonymous whistleblower 
information, but it actually makes it 
far more difficult. 
This amendment won’t allow IG of-
fices to use any telephone or computer 
systems to receive the anonymous 
whistleblower 
information. 
Instead, 
they will have to rely on receiving such 
sensitive information by mail, which is 
obviously problematic, including com-
plicating an IG’s ability to evaluate 
the validity and authenticity of these 
tips and complaints. 
I also oppose the amendment offered 
by Representative PORTER, which at-
tempts to create another unnecessary 
reporting requirement for the inspec-
tors general to report to Congress on 
the timeliness of resolving whistle-
blower retaliation complaints. 
The problem is that IG offices are al-
ready required to include this informa-
tion in their semiannual report to Con-
gress, provided every 6 months. This 
includes information on what, if any, 
consequences have been imposed to 
hold the official who engaged in retal-
iation accountable. This amendment’s 
duplicative reporting requirement only 
wastes more time that an IG should be 
spending on investigating waste, fraud, 
and abuse. 
Finally, I oppose the amendment of-
fered by Representative SPANBERGER, 
which would prohibit the suspension, 
revocation, denial, or other determina-
tion relating to a security clearance of 
a whistleblower. This complete prohi-
bition could put national security at 
risk. 
For example, an employee working to 
undermine a national security policy 
or program could claim that he or she 
is a whistleblower and continue to have 
access to sensitive information, even 
while the agency evaluated the merits 
of the whistleblower’s accusation. 
There are approved procedures for 
whistleblowing in the intelligence com-
munity, but this amendment would 
prohibit revoking a security clearance, 
even if the so-called whistleblower ig-
nores those procedures. This is an un-
acceptable risk to our Nation. Those 
holding security clearances have as-
sumed a special level of public trust, 
and with that comes special expecta-
tions. 
Mr. Chair, I oppose these amend-
ments, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE), the distinguished chair-
woman of the Committee on the Judi-
ciary Subcommittee on Crime, Ter-
rorism and Homeland Security. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I 
thank the distinguished gentlewoman 
for her work as chairwoman of the 
Committee on Oversight and Reform. 
Again, I give her my deepest apprecia-
tion for the enormous legacy of leader-
ship that she has given to issues of em-
powerment, civil rights, civil liberties, 
and the rights of women. I thank 
Chairwoman MALONEY. 
I rise today to support the under-
lying bill, H.R. 2988, and address my 
amendment, of which I am very grate-
ful has been included in the en bloc. 
It does make a difference. Whistle-
blowers can help change governments 
for the best. They are part of the con-
stitutional infrastructure of ensuring 
due process and the rights of the vul-
nerable. 
My amendment reinforces the spirit 
of confidentiality by providing another 
way to communicate whistleblower in-
formation to an OIG that poses less 
risk of confidentiality being lost or 
being breached while not affecting ex-
isting mechanisms, especially in some 
cases when there is a concern about the 
threat of retaliation. A potential whis-
tleblower might be unwilling to pro-
vide information for fear of con-
sequences if their identity is disclosed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7832 
September 14, 2022 
I am very glad to say that the Gov-
ernment Accountability Project is sup-
porting my amendment. They wrote in 
their letter of support for my amend-
ment: ‘‘This is solid, commonsense leg-
islation to restore what works if we let 
it. For many whistleblowers, the deci-
sive factor whether they bear witness 
or remain silent observers is whether 
they will remain anonymous.’’ 
‘‘It will increase the flow of evidence 
and prevent retaliation.’’ 
Mr. Chair, I include in the RECORD 
the 
Government 
Accountability 
Project letter dated September 13, 2022. 
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT, 
Washington, DC, September 13, 2022. 
Hon. SHEILA JACKSON LEE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE LEE: This letter is 
to express support and appreciation for your 
amendment to the Whistleblower Protection 
Improvement Act that would upgrade the 
safety of channels for anonymous whistle-
blowing disclosures to Offices of Inspector 
General. The amendment would require 
OIG’s to restore traditional, effective chan-
nels to share evidence that had been can-
celed for more convenient but unreliable 
high tech options such as the internet or 
telephones. In addition to those channels, 
agencies would have to restore services such 
as secure drop boxes and accept anonymous 
disclosures by mail. 
This is solid, common-sense legislation to 
restore what works if we let it. For many 
whistleblowers, the decisive factor whether 
they bear witness or remain silent observers 
is whether they will remain anonymous. Un-
fortunately, many understandably do not 
trust OIG confidentiality safeguards, because 
OIG’s routinely breach them with impunity. 
While nearly all lG’s have anonymous hot-
lines or phone channels, those engaging in 
surveillance often are one step ahead with 
tactics that expose the witness. This is an 
instance where the old-fashioned way is the 
safest. But at too many agencies it no longer 
is available, as risky high-tech options now 
monopolize the disclosure channel. 
The bottom line is that sometimes tried 
and true approaches can work best, even if 
less convenient. Your amendment would 
apply that truth where it counts most— 
shielding the identify of endangered whistle-
blowers. It will increase the flow of evidence 
and prevent retaliation. 
Appreciatively, 
TOM DEVINE, 
Legal Director. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I ask 
my colleagues to support the en bloc, 
the underlying legislation, and the 
Jackson Lee amendment. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
2988, the Whistleblower Protection Improve-
ment Act, and thank you for bringing this im-
portant legislation to the floor today. 
I applaud the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform for this timely and purposeful bill. By 
strengthening whistleblower protections, H.R. 
2988 would enhance the capabilities of the Of-
fices of Inspector General at each government 
agency to improve government accountability 
and transparency. 
Whistleblowers are uniquely positioned to 
know of actions that derogate from laws, regu-
lations, stated government objectives, and the 
best interests of the American people. 
As a matter of public policy, potential whis-
tleblowers should be encouraged to come 
forth with information that improves our gov-
ernment’s operations, efficiency, and effective-
ness. 
To incentivize such noble conduct, whistle-
blowers must be assured of protection and in-
sulated from retaliation for the accountability 
they facilitate when an OIG pursues their 
leads. 
Indeed, being a whistleblower is an act of 
patriotism—helping 
our 
government 
serve 
Americans more responsibly—and those who 
provide this service should be honored, not 
vilified. 
I would also like to thank the Rules Com-
mittee for making my amendment in order, 
and the Committee on Oversight and Reform 
for including it in the En Bloc amendment. 
My amendment adds a key mechanism to 
amplify the operational impact of the bill, and 
it is supported by the Government Account-
ability Project. 
H.R. 2988 addresses very important aspects 
of the handling of whistleblower complaints, 
whistleblower rights against any retaliatory ac-
tion, and vital protections to avoid disclosures 
of identity, breaches of confidentiality, and re-
taliation. 
My amendment reinforces the spirit of con-
fidentiality by providing another way to com-
municate whistleblower information to an OIG 
that poses less risk of confidentiality being 
breached, while not affecting existing mecha-
nisms. 
In some cases—especially when there is 
concern about a threat of retaliation—a poten-
tial whistleblower might be unwilling to provide 
information for fear of consequences if their 
identity is disclosed. 
To encourage whistleblowers to share infor-
mation in these situations, my amendment di-
rects the Office of Inspector General in each 
agency to establish a mechanism to receive 
whistleblower information that is completely 
anonymous and assured of remaining anony-
mous. 
By being able to submit information in a way 
that anonymity is assured, some potential 
whistleblowers who might otherwise not be 
willing to share information with the OIG may 
be willing to do so. 
As the Government Accountability Project 
wrote in their letter of support for my amend-
ment, ‘‘This is solid, common-sense legislation 
to restore what works if we let it. For many 
whistleblowers, the decisive factor whether 
they bear witness or remain silent observers is 
whether they will remain anonymous. . . . It 
will increase the flow of evidence and prevent 
retaliation.’’ 
The anonymous method could be by send-
ing a letter through the mail, dropping a paper 
note into a receptacle, or some other mecha-
nism devised by the OIGs that cannot be 
traced back to the whistleblower. 
These approaches assure anonymity, unlike 
submission through a website or phone call, 
which could be traced back to the person sub-
mitting the information. 
By submitting facts with full anonymity, a 
whistleblower does not run the risk of their 
identity being disclosed either accidentally, by 
court order, or by other means. 
Ideally, an OIG may prefer to know the 
identity of the person providing insights so 
they can contact them for more details. 
Yet, since some people with vital informa-
tion may refuse to submit it due to the risk of 
exposure, the public interest in receiving use-
ful insights from an anonymous source out-
weighs an OIG’s interest in contacting them. 
With the information that it receives, the 
OIG could pursue facts and elevate its inves-
tigation through other channels. 
My amendment would create a channel for 
this to occur. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS), the vice chair of 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure Subcommittee on Coast 
Guard and Maritime Transportation. 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of my amendment to 
the Whistleblower Protection Improve-
ment Act. 
Historically, there has been a double 
standard between Federal and cor-
porate whistleblowers seeking reprieve 
for retaliatory actions taken against 
them. While corporate whistleblowers 
can have their day in court, Federal 
whistleblowers’ cases fall only under 
the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems 
Protection Board. The Whistleblower 
Protection Improvement Act would 
remedy this by allowing certain Fed-
eral whistleblowers to file their claims 
in district court. 
My amendment would ensure that we 
continue to make evidence-based im-
provements to the Federal whistle-
blower case review process by requiring 
the GAO to study the outcomes of this 
bill. Specifically, my amendment calls 
on the GAO to report on the timeliness 
of MSPB rulings and the rates of Fed-
eral whistleblowers opting for district 
court trials. It requires the GAO to 
offer recommendations for the MSPB 
to make improvements to its review 
process so that Federal whistleblowers 
who put their jobs, careers, and reputa-
tions on the line to call out wrong-
doing are given the respect of a timely 
review. 
This bill is critical to improving pro-
tections for Federal whistleblowers and 
enhancing accountability across the 
Federal Government. My amendment 
would ensure that we collect the evi-
dence necessary to continue to make 
improvements. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to 
support the amendments en bloc. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I am prepared to

time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 
the balance of my time for closing. 
Let me conclude by saying this: We 
have countless rules on the books per-
taining to whistleblower protection. 
We have good whistleblower rules. I 
can assure my friends on the other side 
of the aisle, we have plenty of whistle-
blowers coming forward 
now 
with 
issues, and they are going to be pro-
tected. The rules on the books will pro-
tect those whistleblowers. 
What my friends on the other side of 
the aisle are trying to do, I fear, is cre-
ate a situation where any poor-per-
forming employee who is receiving

poor reviews from their agency can 
claim to be a whistleblower, and there-
fore, they will be on the Federal pay-
roll for the rest of their career. Then 
they can retire and draw a pension for 
the rest of their life. 
This is unacceptable in the private 
sector. We care about whistleblowers. 
We welcome whistleblowers to come to 
the House Committee on Oversight and 
Reform to speak to the Republican mi-
nority members. They are and they 
will be protected because we have good 
whistleblower laws on the books. 
These proposed amendments make 
our good whistleblower laws worse, and 
we need to oppose them. 
Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
The underlying bill is both landmark 
legislation for freedom of speech and 
for 
government 
accountability. 
I 
strongly urge my colleagues to vote in 
favor of this landmark legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. Chair, I move that the com-

Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. I withdraw my motion. 
The CHAIR. The motion is with-
drawn. 
The question is on the amendments

The question was taken; and the 
Chair announced that the noes ap-

Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.

BLUMENAUER, Chair of the Committee 
of the Whole House on the state of the 
Union, reported that that Committee,

IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 8326) to 
amend title 13, United States Code, to 
improve the operations of the Bureau 
of the Census, and for other purposes, 
with Mr. BLUMENAUER in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the 
bill is considered read the first time. 
General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form or their respective designees. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY) and the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
will each control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 8326, the Ensuring a Fair and Ac-
curate Census Act. 
The decennial Census is a critical 
part of our democratic system. In fact, 
it is required by the Constitution. The 
results of the Census determine the dis-
tribution of over $1.5 trillion in Federal 
funds, apportionment of the House of 
Representatives and State legislative 
districts, and public and private sector 
investments. 
b 1645 
It is critical that the Census count is 
complete, fair, and accurate. The En-
suring a Fair and Accurate Census Act 
will help make sure that it is. 
This bill is informed by the Oversight 
Committee’s multi-year investigation 
into political interference by the pre-
vious administration during the 2020 
Census, including the effort to add a 
citizenship question despite strong op-
position from expert statisticians and 
demographers at the Census Bureau. 
In fact, the Census Bureau’s top data 
scientist warned that the citizenship 
question ‘‘harms the quality of the 
Census count.’’ 
The Supreme Court ruled in favor 
with the Democrats and ultimately 
stepped in to block the citizenship 
question, ruling that the rationale for 
adding it to the Census ‘‘seems to have 
been contrived.’’ 
The previous administration took 
other steps that risked undermining 
the independent, nonpartisan nature of 
the Census. They appointed an unprec-
edented 
eight 
political 
appointees 
where 
there 
were 
previously 
only 
three, and they tried to rush the proc-
essing of the Census data, despite re-
peated warnings from career staff that 
this would compromise the integrity of 
the Census count. 
Partisan manipulation of the Census 
is simply wrong. My bill would protect 
the Census and ensure this cannot hap-
pen again, regardless of which party is 
in power. 
We are considering this legislation at 
a critical time. While the 2030 Census is 
years away, the design and planning 
began at the Bureau even before the 
2020 numbers were released. 
As our Nation’s largest peacetime 
mobilization, the Census requires de-
tailed and thorough planning. However, 
even the best plans face challenges in 
the field, and the 2020 Census faced un-
precedented obstacles. 
In the runup to the 2020 Census, the 
Bureau was consistently denied the ap-
propriations—the funding that it need-
ed—to execute its operational plans. 
Among other impacts, this uncertainty 
forced cutbacks in outreach to commu-
nities that are considered hard to 
reach. 
The coronavirus pandemic forced the 
Census Bureau to suspend field oper-
ations at the most critical time; and 
most damaging, the previous adminis-
tration demanded a last-minute, un-
tested question on citizenship, and in-
stalled a record number of political ap-
pointees with unclear duties to get 
that done. 
This legislation would vest key deci-
sion-making authority over the Census 
in the appropriate Senate-confirmed 
official, the Census Director. It would 
limit the number of political ap-
pointees within the Bureau to no more 
than four, which is consistent with his-
torical precedent. 
This bill would also require that new 
Census questions be thoroughly re-
searched and analyzed, certified by the 
Secretary of Commerce, evaluated by 
the GAO, and shared with Congress be-
fore being added to the Census ques-
tionnaire. 
This bill will also increase trans-
parency and support long-term plan-
ning by requiring the Bureau to submit 
its projected 5-year budget estimates 
to both the President and Congress. 
Finally, the bill codifies existing ad-
visory committees charged with engag-
ing with hard-to-count communities 
and advancing best practices in the 
field of data science. It also establishes 
an advisory committee aimed directly 
at ensuring the 2030 Census is success-
ful. 
I am proud that my bill has the sup-
port of four former directors of the 
Census Bureau, who served under ad-
ministrations led by both Democrats 
and Republicans. These former direc-
tors have 15 years of experience serving

cennial Censuses. 
In a statement, they commended the 
bill’s objective and said that it ‘‘pro-
tects the independence and integrity of 
the scientific mission of the Census Bu-

cluded, ‘‘trust in our Nation’s official

on the decennial count to allow it to be 
exploited for partisan gain.’’ 
STATEMENT BY FORM U.S. CENSUS BUREAU 
DIRECTORS—JULY 12, 2022 
IN SUPPORT OF HOUSE LEGISLATION ‘‘ENSURING 
A FAIR AND & ACCURATE CENSUS ACT’’ 
We applaud the legislation introduced this 
week by the Chair of the House Committee 
on Oversight and Reform, Rep. Carolyn B. 
Maloney (D–NY) that we believe will help 
preserve and protect the independence and 
integrity of the scientific mission at the U.S. 
Census Bureau. 
Having helped to plan, execute or lead five 
decennial censuses serving nine Presidents of 
both parties, and having closely observed the 
2020 Decennial process, we strongly feel the 
reforms in the ‘‘Ensuring a Fair and & Accu-
rate Census Act’’ would help build greater 
trust and confidence in the essential data 
the Census Bureau supplies to the nation. 
Collectively, the provisions of this bill 
strengthen the professional roles of career 
scientists, provide greater transparency into 
methods and processes across the 130 Census 
surveys and censuses, and enhance Congres-
sional oversight over Bureau functions. 
Trust in the nation’s official data is essen-
tial to the democracy and the economy, and 
this legislation will undergird that trust.

OPINION: THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S AS-
SAULT ON THE CENSUS MUST NOT HAPPEN 
AGAIN 
The Trump administration engaged in a 
years-long, multi-pronged effort to sabotage 
the U.S. census, largely centered on adding a 
question on citizenship to the 2020 count. A 
new report, released last week by the House 
Committee on Oversight and Reform, paints 
a grim picture of what was happening behind 
the scenes. 
A draft of an August 2017 memo, prepared 
by a political appointee in the Commerce De-
partment, examined the idea of using citi-
zenship data for apportioning seats in the 
House of Representatives, concluding it 
would likely be unconstitutional. Later 
versions omitted that language and came 
down in favor of including the question. 
The newly released documents undercut 
the Trump administration’s repeated claims 
that the citizenship question had nothing to 
do with apportionment. The Constitution 
plainly states: ‘‘Representatives shall be ap-
portioned among the several States accord-
ing to their respective numbers, counting 
the whole number of persons in each State.’’ 
At the time, then-Commerce Secretary 
Wilbur Ross and other officials offered var-
ious unconvincing justifications for adding 
the question, most frequently that it would 
help enforce the Voting Rights Act. The Su-
preme Court blocked the move, with Chief 
Justice John G. Roberts Jr. calling the ra-
tionale ‘‘contrived.’’ The House report rein-
forces that conclusion. 
The census is a crucial tool, used not only 
for apportionment and redistricting, but also 
for allocating approximately $1.5 trillion in 
annual federal aid to states and localities. 
Experts warned that a citizenship question 
would frighten immigrants and lead to the 
undercounting of minority communities. 
Though the question was ultimately not 
included, the lengthy and public battle over 
it appears to have been enough: The Census 
Bureau reported that Black, Hispanic and 
Native Americans were undercounted at 
higher levels in 2020 compared with 2010— 
Hispanics 
by 
a 
statistically 
significant 
amount—while White and Asian Americans 
were overcounted. Never mind that this 
might have backfired on Republicans, with 
the bureau reporting it significantly under-
counted populations in Florida and Texas— 
red states with large minority commu-
nities—and overcounted populations in blue 
states such as Rhode Island and Minnesota. 
The accuracy of the census depends in no 
small part on its credibility, which has been 
severely damaged. 
The next census is in 2030, but—given the 
scale of the undertaking and importance of 
the results—Congress should work quickly to 
insulate it from political interference. A bill 
recently introduced by Rep. Carolyn B. 
Maloney (D–N.Y.), chairwoman of the House 
Oversight Committee, would do just that. 
The Ensuring a Fair and Accurate Census 
Act would restrict the number of political 
appointees at the Census Bureau, bar the re-
moval of a bureau director without just 
cause and require new questions to be sub-
mitted to Congress ahead of time. It would 
also mandate new questions be ‘‘researched, 
tested and certified’’ by the commerce sec-
retary and ‘‘evaluated by the Government 
Accountability Office.’’ 
Though it was not able to implement its 
most drastic plans, the Trump administra-
tion’s assault on the integrity of the census 
should be an urgent warning. Too much rests 
on the decennial count to allow it to be ex-
ploited for partisan gain. 
[From the Washington Post, Sept. 13, 2020] 
OPINION: THE CENSUS IS ON THE VERGE OF 
DISASTER 
(By the Editorial Board) 
Here is one of the least surprising revela-
tions ever leaked from the federal govern-
ment: According to an internal Census Bu-
reau document, major, uncorrectable errors 
may result from forcing the bureau’s enu-
merators and number-crunchers to rush 
through the decennial count. House Over-
sight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn 
B. Maloney (D–NY) revealed the document 
this month, claiming it was a presentation 
for Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who 
oversees the bureau. It shows that the deci-
sion of Senate Republicans and the Trump 
administration to give the bureau no more 
time to finish a count that started late and 
has encountered pandemic-related problems 
threatens to corrupt for a decade the process 
of 
distributing 
congressional 
seats 
and 
doling out some $1.5 trillion in annual fed-
eral aid. 
‘‘A compressed review period creates risk 
for serious errors not being discovered in the 
data—thereby significantly decreasing data 
quality,’’ the document warns. 
To be clear, this would not be the fault of 
the bureau’s professionals, whom Repub-
licans have put in an impossible position. 
They are facing a statutory deadline requir-
ing that they deliver their count by Dec. 31. 
The bureau had previously asked for more 
time. House Democrats authorized a deadline 
extension. Senate Republicans failed to do 
so, and the Trump administration ordered 
last month that door-knocking conclude by 
Sept. 30, weeks earlier than the experts had 
hoped. 
The newly revealed document shows that, 
at the time the short timetable was an-
nounced, the bureau knew that ‘‘abbreviated 
processes or eliminated activities . . . will 
reduce accuracy.’’ Not only would door- 
knocking end weeks sooner, but also the 
number-crunching needed after the door- 
knockers finished their work would be com-
pressed into 92 days. Since 1990, the number- 
crunching has consumed between 140 and 185 
days, according to Ms. Maloney. ‘‘Serious er-
rors discovered in the data may not be 
fixed—due to lack of time to research and 
understand the root cause or to re-run and 
re-review one or multiple state files,’’ the 
document warns. ‘‘A compressed review pe-
riod creates risk for errors being present in 
the data.’’ 
The only perspective from which this is 
not a potential disaster is that of Repub-
licans seeking maximum partisan advantage. 
The Trump administration already tried 
once to skew the count by adding a citizen-
ship question to the census form, which 
would have deterred immigrants, even legal 
ones, from responding. The Supreme Court 
halted that move. Yet rushing the census 
might help Republicans because poor and mi-
nority communities tend to be the ones 
undercounted, which would make many 
Democratic-leaning states appear to be less 
populous than they are—and therefore due 
less money and political representation. 
The Senate should have passed a covid–19 
relief bill months ago, with a census deadline 
extension in it. With the bureau up against a 
wall, senators should not wait to agree on 
the rest of a relief package to give the 
counters more time. The census needs clar-
ity, now.

led 18 states in suing and won before the U.S. 
Supreme Court in 2019, which blocked the 
Trump/Ross citizenship question. 
That we know, but now Rep. Carolyn 
Maloney’s Committee on Oversight and Re-
form has found even more evidence and proof 
that it was all a political ploy, not rooted in 
any legitimate demographic reasoning. To 
prevent future such manipulation, Maloney 
has a bill on the House floor today to protect 
the integrity of the Census Bureau. We hope 
that the measure passes with large majori-
ties of both parties. 
After Chief Justice John Roberts and the 
high court stopped the citizenship question, 
Trump and Ross tried again in the summer 
of 2020, after the count was completed, with 
a memorandum instructing the Census Bu-
reau to exclude undocumented immigrants 
from the apportionment process which di-
vides up the 435 House seats among the 
states based on population gains and losses 
in the prior decade. Again, the federal courts 
stepped in and the clearly unconstitutional 
maneuver was abandoned. 
Still, the sustained efforts targeting immi-
grants undoubtedly had the intended effect 
to dampen the participation rate of non-citi-
zens, documented or not, which was Trump’s 
goal from the beginning. 
Maloney’s bill protects the director of the 
Bureau of the Census from meddling by sec-
retary of commerce, an appointee and sup-
porter of the president. Any new questions 
on the census forms must be submitted in 
advance to Congress and certified that they 
satisfy established statistical policies and 
procedures (not just because a president 
wants it). The Congress is also to receive a 
biannual report detailing preparations for 
the next big count. 
We got lucky last time that the courts 
stopped Trump and Ross from trying to warp 
the census numbers. Next time we shouldn’t 
have to take that risk. Pass the Maloney 
bill.

CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman. 
POPULATION ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA, 
Alexandria, VA, September 12, 2022. 
Hon. CAROLYN MALONEY, 
Rayburn House Office Building, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN MALONEY: On behalf 
of the organizations we lead, the Population 
Association of America and Association of 
Population Centers, we are writing to ex-
press support for your efforts to enact con-
structive reforms at the U.S. Census Bureau. 
Your bill, H.R. 8326, Ensuring a Fair and Ac-
curate Census Act, contains several provi-
sions that would strengthen the Census Bu-
reau as the nation’s principal statistical 
agency. 
We are pleased that the bill, for example, 
would empower the Census Bureau to com-
municate its annual funding needs more di-
rectly to the public and clarify the process 
by which the agency adds and approves ques-
tions on the decennial census. Further, we 
applaud provisions that reauthorize existing 
advisory committees, such as the Census Sci-
entific Advisory Committee and the Na-
tional Advisory Committee, both of which 
have served as effective forums for data 
users and experts, including population sci-
entists, to engage with the Census Bureau. 
H.R. 8326 is an important first step to en-
sure the Bureau can sustain its critical mis-
sion and operations while undergoing nec-
essary adaptions in preparation for the 2030 
Census. We congratulate you on your leader-
ship and look forward to working with you 
and your colleagues as it proceeds through 
the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
DR. SONALDE DESAI, 
President, Population Association of America. 
DR. SARA R. CURRAN, 
President, Association of Population Centers. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, this bill is sensible 
and is driven by facts uncovered in our 
investigation and input from both civil 
rights groups and professionals at the 
Census Bureau. 
We must have a full, fair, and accu-
rate Census count so that every Amer-
ican can have faith that they and their 
communities are receiving the rep-
resentation and the services that they 
deserve. To do that, we need a non-
partisan, expert-driven Census Bureau. 
This bill is a strong first step to meet 
that goal. 
Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Today, Americans continue to face 
several crises created by the Biden ad-
ministration: Sky-high inflation, pain-
fully high gas prices, and supply chain 
shortages. 
President Biden’s border crisis is al-
lowing waves of illegal immigrants and 
fentanyl shipments to flood across our 
southern border. 
Our children are suffering from his-
toric learning losses and a mental 
health crisis because this administra-
tion allowed radical teachers unions to 
keep schools closed. 
Yet what are Democrats prioritizing 
today instead of these crises impacting 
Americans’ everyday lives? The Demo-
crats’ Ensuring a Fair and Accurate 
Census Act. 
This bill has nothing to do with the 
American people’s priorities. In fact, it 
will do nothing to make the Census 
more fair and accurate. Instead, it 
places a great deal of power in the 
hands of unelected bureaucrats and 
hamstrings future Presidents. 
During the prior Census, the Presi-
dent sought to include in the Census a 
question simply asking respondents 
whether they were American citizens. 
The Supreme Court found this was con-
stitutional but that the Census Bureau 
had gone about it improperly. 
This bill would prevent the inclusion 
of such a question in the future, a ques-
tion key to upholding the principle of 
one citizen, one vote. 
Now, under the Biden administra-
tion, there are questions about whether 
the Department of Commerce delivered 
accurate apportionment results derived 
from the Census. Those results were 
critical because they determined the 
apportionment of this body’s 435 con-
gressional districts among the several 
States. We still don’t know for sure 
whether 
the 
apportionment 
results 
were fair and accurate. 
But this bill does nothing to fix that 
problem or any of the other real prob-
lems associated with the 2020 Census. 
Indeed, it will make it easier for future 
Census results to drive the apportion-
ment of congressional districts un-
fairly to favor blue, Democrat-leaning 
States over red, Republican-leaning 
States. 
Why is that? 
Because the bill weakens the ac-
countability of the Census Bureau to 
the President and the Secretary of 
Commerce, committing by statute all 
operational, statistical, and technical 
decisions about the Census to the Cen-
sus Bureau’s Director. 
The bill makes it harder to overrule 
the Director even when the President, 
the Secretary, or Congress are con-
cerned, the Director’s decisions will 
yield an unfair or inaccurate Census. 
Making matters worse, the bill al-
lows only an unaccountable career em-
ployee to serve as acting director when 
no Senate-confirmed director is in 
place. 
Finally, the bill severely constrains 
the ability of future Censuses to in-
clude important new questions, such as 
the citizenship question, which a ma-
jority of Americans want asked on the 
Census. 
But it is precisely the counting of ac-
tual citizens that ensures Census re-
sults will produce congressional dis-
tricts fairly, representing all citizens 
in Congress. 
During the Oversight and Reform 
Committee’s consideration of this bill, 
Republicans offered amendments that 
would 
have 
cured 
these 
problems. 
These amendments would have made 
sure Census Bureau officials remained 
accountable to the voters through the 
President. They would have made sure 
a question on citizenship would have 
been included in future Censuses, guar-
anteeing a fair basis for the apportion-
ment of congressional districts. 
But were Democrats concerned then 
about ensuring a fair and accurate Cen-
sus by supporting these amendments? 
No. Democrats voted them down on a 
party-line vote. 
Mr. Chairman, the American people 
deserve better from this legislative 
body. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Government Operations 
for the Oversight Committee. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 8326, the En-
suring a Fair and Accurate Census Act. 
When Democrats took majority in 
the House in 2018, I was asked what our 
top oversight projects were going to be. 
When I said, among them, the Census, 
it elicited surprise and even some 
laughs. 
The Census is a huge dataset that un-
derpins whether we fairly represent 
Americans and how we spend the entire 
Federal budget. 
The Trump administration and its 
partisan Census Bureau undermined 
this critical task in March of 2018 when 
it planned to add a citizenship question

to the Census that would have violated 
the Constitution and reduced response 
rates, and they knew it. 
I joined my colleague and friend, the 
late Chairman Elijah Cummings, in 
leading the fight against this question. 
I then partnered with Chairwoman 
MALONEY to block the Trump adminis-
tration from cutting off the Census 
deadline early and excluding undocu-
mented immigrants from the Census 
count. 
Our committee’s dogged oversight 
work prevented these illegal and im-
moral attempts to subvert our very de-
mocracy as enshrined in the Constitu-
tion. However, we need permanent re-
forms to ensure that no matter the 
President or political environment, the 
Census remains apolitical. That is why 
we must support this act. 
This bill requires the Secretary of 
Commerce to certify that any new 
questions on the decennial Census 
must meet best practices standards, 
and it caps the Census Bureau at three 
political 
appointees, 
eliminating 
a 
President’s ability to flood the Bureau 
with his acolytes and loyalists. 
Congress must bolster the Census Bu-
reau now, so we are prepared for a fair 
and accurate 2030 Census. 
Mr. 
Chair, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
MALONEY
for her leadership and for 
sponsoring this bill. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Chair, I rise in oppo-
sition to this bill. The intention of this 
bill is clear: It is to prevent a future 
Republican President from adding a 
citizenship question to the United 
States Census. 
And yet the question of citizenship 
was first offered by President Thomas 
Jefferson in 1800; and from its introduc-
tion in the Census of 1820 through 1950, 
that question was included on every 
Census. 
Now, when you think about the lan-
guage of the Constitution itself, it 
gives Congress the authority to call a 
Census to enumerate the population. 
And for what was the purpose? The 
main purpose, of course, was for appor-
tionment, for representation of the 
citizens of the United States. 
The reality, though, is it has become 
far more than that, and that seems to 
be permissible within certain limits of 
the Constitution itself. 
Since 1950, there have been additional 
Federal surveys that have included 
some form of the question of citizen-
ship, not necessarily included in the 
Census itself. 
But in the recent case cited by Chair-
woman MALONEY
just moments ago, 
where she said that they threw it out 
and said you can’t ask that question, it 
was not because of the question. In 
fact, the Supreme Court specifically 
said in Department of Commerce v. 
New York that Congress has the right 
to ask that question, and the Depart-
ment of Commerce has the authority 
to include the question of citizenship. 
The decision states, ‘‘The enumeration 
clause permits Congress, and by exten-
sion the Secretary, to inquire about 
citizenship on the questionnaire.’’ 
b 1700 
That rationale does not work from 
the chairwoman. I realize a lot of my 
colleagues don’t realize and understand 
and appreciate what is happening on 
our southern border. From October of 
last year through the end of July, Bor-
der Patrol has reported nearly 2 mil-
lion encounters along our southern 
border, that does not include who en-
tered and have gotten away. 
Nearly a quarter of the encounters 
feature a person who had at least one 
prior encounter in the past 12 months. 
We, as policymakers, if we are going to 
get policy and data, which was just al-
luded to by Mr. CONNOLLY, we should 
have some of the most important data, 
and that is who is in this country ille-
gally and who is a citizen and who is 
not. 
Whether someone is a citizen is an 
important datapoint that should be re-
corded on the Census and on other Fed-
eral surveys. It is well past time that 
Congress direct the Census Bureau to 
ask this question like it did for over 100 
years. 
This bill is, instead, an attempt to 
cynically block the inclusion of the 
citizenship question on the Census and 
seeks to insulate career staff at the 
Census 
Bureau from any account-
ability. This is not—this is not a good 
bill. 
This bill does not help us get to 
where we need to get in terms of under-
standing what is going on in this coun-
try so we can make policy that is good. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, this bill does not ad-
dress Congressional apportionment. It 
is about making the Census fair and ac-
curate. 
Nevertheless, our Census count has 
never been limited based on citizenship 
and there is no doubt that doing so 
would violate the Constitution. The 
14th Amendment says seats in Congress 
are based on the whole number of per-
sons in each State. Persons, not citi-
zens. 
Last Congress, I chaired a hearing 
with four former Census directors who 
served under both Democrats and Re-
publicans. All four agreed that exclud-
ing undocumented immigrants from 
the apportionment count violated the 
Constitution. That is also the position 
taken by previous administrations, in-
cluding under Republican Presidents. 
In fact, my committee recently un-
covered a draft internal legal memo 
from the Trump administration about 
the citizenship question. That memo 
admitted that using citizenship data to 
exclude immigrants from the appor-
tionment counts would violate, ‘‘over 
200 years of precedent.’’ That damning 
language was removed from the final 
memo used to push the citizenship 
question. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I thank the chairwoman for 
her outstanding leadership of this com-
mittee. It has been a pleasure to serve 
with you and under you and know that 
your interests go far beyond anything 
that I have heard this evening. 
As a matter of fact, the Census is 
very important for far more reasons 
than just apportionment or just for 
looking at one issue or looking at im-
migration. I guess I have been involved 
in Census-taking for about 40 years, 
and every 10 years we go through this 
angst in my community, whether or 
not we are going to get a fair and accu-
rate count, whether or not the people 
who are there are going to be counted 
so that resources which come as a re-
sult will flow back to the area. 
Well, that has not happened. And 
even after the expressions of the last 
round, it was determined that there 
were undercounts, that there were peo-
ple missed. And so everything that we 
can do to try and make sure that the 
Census taken is fair, accurate, and 
comprehensive, we need to do that. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chairman, I have no more 
speakers on the underlying bill, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I am pre-
pared to close, and I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Chairman, the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives should focus on helping 
the American people survive economic 
turmoil and defending our borders and 
national security. 
I urge House Democrats to get back 
to what the American people elected us 
to do: Conduct oversight over the Fed-
eral Government and the Biden admin-
istration, which is on a path to destroy 
America. 
We need to hold hearings, conduct 
oversight, and pass legislation address-
ing the crises affecting America today. 
That is our constitutional responsi-
bility. But instead, we are spending 
valuable resources and time on divisive 
political messaging bills. 
I am just amazed that the Democrats 
advocate for legislation on the House 
floor pertaining to the Census, which 
would ask a question about your sexual 
preference, but they want to pass legis-
lation to oppose asking the question 
whether you are a legal citizen or not. 
That is just another example of tone- 
deaf leadership. That is not what the 
American people want. 
Mr. Chairman, I oppose H.R. 8326, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
I stress the urgency and importance 
of this legislation. The United States 
Census Bureau is a foundational insti-
tution and one that we must take all 
necessary steps to protect.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7837 
September 14, 2022 
The Census is for all people and 
should count every person. Efforts to 
politicize the Bureau have real con-
sequences that can reduce response 
rates and thereby lessen the represen-
tation and resources available to com-
munities. 
I thank my colleagues for speaking 
in support of this bill, the former direc-
tors and advocates that have lent their 
support, and I encourage us all to vote 
in favor of ensuring a fair and accurate 
Census count. 
No matter the party affiliation, 
every one of us has an interest in pro-
viding our best services to our con-
stituents. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues 
to join me in support of H.R. 8326 and 
the underlying amendments, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8326, the Ensuring a 
Fair and Accurate Census Act, and thank you 
for bringing this vital legislation to the floor 
today. 
I applaud the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform for this necessary and thoughtful bill. 
By establishing structural and functional stand-
ards, H.R. 8326 would insulate the Census 
Bureau from the type of tactics and abuse it 
encountered in the few years preceding the 
2020 decennial census count. 
Among its key provisions are the statutory 
codification of the Director’s and Deputy Direc-
tor’s roles. Doing so would improve the Cen-
sus Bureau’s operational effectiveness, ac-
countability, and transparency. 
Specifying their duties also provides the op-
portunity to establish responsibilities that will 
enhance the work product of the Census by 
improving the fair and accurate counting of all 
Americans. 
In that context, I offered an amendment to 
H.R. 8326, and I would like to thank the Rules 
Committee for making my amendment in 
order, and the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform for including it in the En Bloc amend-
ment. 
By reforming the operations of the Census 
Bureau, this bill enables us to ensure that ra-
cial and ethnic equity in the decennial count 
will be a priority in future decennial counts. 
My amendment would enhance the bill’s 
operational impact. 
It would specify that the deputy director ap-
point an official with responsibility to optimize 
racial and ethnic equity in the Census count. 
To ensure that equity be a priority, this official 
would report directly to the director and deputy 
director. 
My amendment directs the equity official to 
engage and collaborate with organizations that 
have influence with racial and ethnic groups, 
develop strategies and tactics to maximize 
participation of these populations, and rectify 
the undercount that has been typical of recent 
Census counts, especially among immigrants 
and homeless people. 
The status of the efforts to optimize racial 
and ethnic equity will also be included in the 
Census Bureau’s biannual reports to Con-
gress, to ensure accountability and bolster the 
likelihood of progress. 
Optimization of racial and ethnic equity in 
the Census count requires designation of a 
high-ranking official with direct responsibility 
for achieving this goal and reports directly to 
the Census leadership. 
My amendment establishes that function, 
makes racial and ethnic equity in the decen-
nial count a priority, specifies key strategies 
that must be undertaken, and ensures that 
Congress receives regular reports about the 
progress toward the goal. 
H.R. 8326 is an excellent bill with vital re-
forms that are aptly augmented by my amend-
ment’s use of this opportunity to, at the same 
time, advance equity in the Census count. 
In light of the decennial count’s extremely 
consequential impact in terms of funding allo-
cation formulas, political district apportionment, 
and other uses, it is imperative that the Cen-
sus Bureau elevate racial and ethnic equity to 
a top priority in its counting strategies and pro-
cedures. 
My amendment would create a framework 
for achieving this objective. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. CARTER of 
Louisiana). All time for general debate 
has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 5- 
minute rule. 
In lieu of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute recommended by 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, printed in the bill, an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute con-
sisting of the text of Rules Committee 
print 117–464, modified by the amend-
ment printed in part D of House Report 
117–464, shall be considered as adopted. 
The bill, as amended, shall be consid-
ered as an original bill for purpose of 
further amendment under the 5-minute 
rule and shall be considered as read. 
The text of the amendment in the na-
ture of a substitute is as follows:

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled,

September 14, 2022 
amendments. Black, Latino, and indig-
enous communities all were signifi-
cantly undercounted in the 2020 Cen-
sus. 
One of the key provisions of this bill 
is to codify the Bureau’s National Ad-
visory Committee on Racial, Ethnic, 
and Other Populations in order to help 
reduce these undercounts. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE’s amendment will 
enhance this objective by ensuring 
there is a senior employee within the 
Census Bureau who is dedicated to en-
hancing racial and ethnic equity in the 
decennial Census. 
The Constitution requires an enu-
meration that is fair and complete, one 
in which all people are counted so that 
all communities obtain the representa-
tion and services that they deserve. 
This amendment will help achieve 
that. 
I also support the amendment offered 
by Representative CASE, which requires 
the Census Bureau to submit a report 
to Congress on the agency’s process for 
consulting and engaging with jurisdic-
tions and local partners in conducting 
the decennial Census. 
We know that certain communities 
are traditionally harder to count, in-
cluding groups that are mistrustful of 
the government, students and tran-
sient populations, minority commu-
nities, migrant communities, and com-
munities with unique geographic chal-
lenges. 
Engaging with local stakeholders is 
essential to reaching these commu-
nities and ensuring that the Census 
counts everyone in the United States, 
regardless of where they live. This 
amendment will increase transparency 
around the Bureau’s process for engag-
ing with jurisdictions and local part-
ners and ensure that Congress and the 
American people can support the Cen-
sus Bureau in this crucial effort. 
Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I rise to op-
pose the amendments en bloc. 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman 
from Kentucky is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chair, I rise in op-
position to the en bloc package of 
amendments offered by Chairwoman 
MALONEY. 
Specifically, I am opposed to the 
amendments offered by Representative 
JACKSON Lee and Representative CASE 
and will address them each. 
First, Ms. JACKSON LEE’s amendment 
requires the Deputy Director of the 
Census to appoint a new employee 
within the Census Bureau whose sole 
responsibility is to, ‘‘optimize racial 
and ethnic equity in the decennial Cen-
sus population.’’ 
The core mission of the Census Bu-
reau, as it already stands, is to conduct 
an accurate count of all people residing 
in the United States on Census day 
when the decennial Census is being 
conducted. 
This is the mission for every em-
ployee who works on the Census. This 
new position is completely unnecessary 
and redundant of the Census Bureau’s 
preexisting mission to count everyone 
in the United States regardless of their 
race or ethnicity. 
Because this amendment appears to 
be an attempt to inject identity poli-
tics into the Census Bureau’s work, and 
because it would duplicate efforts al-
ready underway at the Census Bureau, 
I must oppose. 
b 1715 
I 
turn 
to 
Representative 
CASE’s 
amendment, which requires the Census 
Bureau to create and submit yet an-
other report to Congress, but it fails to 
require the Census Bureau to actually 
do anything substantive to improve. 
The Census Bureau already conducts 
extensive engagement campaigns with 
local jurisdictions to ensure an accu-
rate count of all people during the de-
cennial Census. This report would re-
quire the Census Bureau to outline ad-
ditional processes for engaging with 
local jurisdictions. 
The amendment would also require 
that the Census Bureau report to Con-
gress on progress in implementing open 
GAO recommendations, but it does not 
outline any deadlines for implementing 
those open recommendations. 
Finally, the amendment contains an 
open-ended invitation for the Census 
Bureau to ask for ‘‘additional re-
sources.’’ This is Washington speak to 
throw even more taxpayer money at 
the Census Bureau in the near future. 
I fear this amendment will merely 
waste precious Census Bureau time and 
resources with an additional report 
with the sole purpose of justifying fu-
ture taxpayer expenditures. 
Therefore, I must oppose both of 
these amendments. 
Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendments en bloc offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
DANNY K. DAVIS). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendments en bloc 
offered by the gentleman from Illinois 
will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MR. HICE OF 
GEORGIA 
The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order 
to consider amendment No. 2 printed in 
part E of House Report 117–464. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will 
designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Strike section 2(b) (relating to for-cause 
removal and duties) and redesignate subse-
quent subsections accordingly. 
Page 3, line 7, strike ‘‘; DEPUTY DIRECTOR’’. 
Page 3, beginning on line 9, strike ‘‘as 
amended by subsection (b), is further amend-
ed—’’ and insert ‘‘is amended by adding at 
the end the following:’’. 
Page 3, strike line 11 and all that follows 
through page 4, line 16. 
Page 4, line 17, redesignate subsection (e) 
as subsection (d). 
Page 6, in the matter following line 13, 
strike ‘‘Deputy Director;’’. 
Strike section 2(d) (relating to position re-
quirements). 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
House Resolution 1339, the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE) and a Member 
opposed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
With all due respect, this bill will do 
anything but ensure a fair and accu-
rate Census. Instead, it threatens to 
produce an unfair and inaccurate Cen-
sus. 
As ranking member of the Govern-
ment Operations Subcommittee, I have 
stressed time and time again that we 
need reforms that will ensure a more 
accountable Federal workforce. But 
time and time again, Democrats show 
that they want anything but account-
ability for civil servants. 
In fact, it is as though they view Fed-
eral employees as a protected and priv-
ileged class, and when a Federal bu-
reaucracy is unaccountable, well, that 
is when it is most likely to threaten 
the American people with rogue activ-
ity like, in this case, providing an un-
fair and inaccurate Census. 
First, it makes the Director of the 
Census unremovable except for ‘‘ineffi-
ciency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance 
in office.’’ Then, it commands that 
only the Director can make oper-
ational, statistical, and technical deci-
sions about the Census. 
Mr. Chairman, what is the Secretary 
of Commerce supposed to do if he or 
she believes that the Census Director is 
making decisions that will lead to an 
unfair or inaccurate Census? Further, 
what is going to happen if there is no 
Director in place? Under the terms of 
the bill, only a career Census Bureau 
official can serve as the Acting Direc-
tor. 
This bill is a perfect example of how 
Democrats think unelected civil serv-
ants should be running our government 
and, in essence, that civil servants 
should be the ones who are governing 
the American people. This bill literally 
is having them attempt to influence 
who represents them. That is not the 
way our system is supposed to work. 
My amendment would strip those 
provisions out of the legislation. If we 
are to ensure a fair and accurate Cen-
sus, then we must ensure an account-
able Census Bureau. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I claim the time in opposi-
tion to the Hice amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7840 
September 14, 2022 
The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I oppose the amendment 
proposed by Representative HICE
of 
Georgia. His amendment would weaken 
the protections in this bill that safe-
guard the Census Bureau from partisan 
manipulation. His amendment elimi-
nates two key provisions from the bill. 
First, the amendment would remove 
the provision requiring that the Bu-
reau have a single Deputy Director po-
sition, which would be filled by a ca-
reer official with relevant knowledge 
and experience, including experience in 
collecting and analyzing data and a 
demonstrated ability to manage large 
organizations. Experts agree that a sin-
gle, qualified Deputy Director is impor-
tant for ensuring smooth operations 
within the Bureau, including when 
there is an absence of a Senate-con-
firmed Census Director. Having a sin-
gle Deputy Director also avoids disrup-
tions that can be caused when multiple 
Deputy Directors are appointed with 
unclear job descriptions. 
That is exactly what happened in the 
last administration. In August 2020, 
while the Census count was already un-
derway, former President Trump ap-
pointed his third Deputy Director to 
the Census Bureau. The unclear duties 
and qualifications of these appointees 
sparked an internal inquiry by the 
Commerce 
Department’s 
Inspector 
General’s Office. 
The amendment would also remove 
the cap on political appointees at the 
Census Bureau. The bill caps that num-
ber at four, which is consistent with 
historical precedent. During the last 
administration, there were an unprece-
dented eight political appointees at the 
Census Bureau. That is far too many 
political appointees for a nonpartisan 
agency like the Census Bureau, and it 
makes the danger of political manipu-
lation much greater. 
I am committed to protecting the in-
tegrity of the Census Bureau and im-
proving each decennial count. Unfortu-
nately, this amendment would make 
these goals harder to achieve. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to 
oppose Representative HICE’s amend-
ment. 
Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield to the gentleman from Kentucky 
(Mr. COMER), who is the ranking mem-
ber of the House Oversight and Reform 
Committee. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the gentleman from Georgia for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of 
this amendment offered by the Govern-
ment Operations Subcommittee rank-
ing member, my colleague, JODY HICE. 
I support this sensible amendment, 
which will preserve vital account-
ability mechanisms for the Director of 
the Census Bureau. The bill attempts 
to insulate the Census Bureau Director 
and empower an unaccountable career 
Deputy Director. We should not be 
tying the hands of a future President 
to properly exercise executive over-
sight over the management of the Cen-
sus Bureau. 
Mr. Chairman, I encourage my col-
leagues to support the commonsense 
Hice amendment. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The Acting CHAIR. The question is 
on the amendment offered by the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
The question was taken; and the Act-
ing Chair announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I 
demand a recorded vote. 
The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to 
clause 6 of rule XVIII, further pro-
ceedings on the amendment offered by 
the gentleman from Georgia will be 
postponed. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I move that the Committee 
do now rise. 
The motion was agreed to. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. 
BOURDEAUX) having assumed the chair, 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana, Acting Chair 
of the Committee of the Whole House 
on the state of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under con-
sideration the bill (H.R. 8326) to amend 
title 13, United States Code, to improve 
the operations of the Bureau of the 
Census, and for other purposes, had 
come to no resolution thereon.

REMEMBERING MOON LANDRIEU 
(Mr. CARTER of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, today, I am honored to re-
member a groundbreaking public serv-
ant, personal mentor, and inspiring 
New Orleanian, the Honorable Moon 
Landrieu, mayor of the city of New Or-
leans. 
A son, father, husband, grandfather, 
brother, and lawyer, Moon Landrieu 
first served in the Louisiana House of 
Representatives in 1960 and next on the 
New Orleans City Council. He was 
elected mayor of the city of New Orle-
ans from 1970 to 1978, served as U.S. 
Secretary of Housing and Urban Devel-
opment from 1979 to 1982, and was a cir-
cuit court judge. 
Throughout his career, he fought for 
equality and justice, opposing Jim 
Crow legislation and successfully out-
lawing segregation in public accom-
modations, standing as a shining light 
during our Nation’s darkest times. 
He passed away on September 5, but 
the Honorable Moon Landrieu and his 
indelible impact will never be forgot-
ten in our world.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
ABORTION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, was truly a tale of two parties. 
While one party—the Democrats—gath-
ered at the White House to celebrate 
the passage of our job-creating agenda, 
the other party—the MAGA Repub-
licans—spent their day introducing a 
nationwide ban on abortions. 
If the American people want to know 
what the difference is between the two 
parties, look no further. One party is 
focused on jobs—that is us; the other is 
focused on nationwide abortion bans— 
that is the extreme MAGA Repub-
licans. 
One party wants to lower inflation 
and help families make ends meet, to 
tackle the generational challenges we 
face and has passed major legislation 
to that effect, now law. The other 
party, apparently, wants to eliminate 
women’s autonomy over their own bod-
ies. 
Here is how you know Republicans 
are dangerously out of touch. Months 
after women had their freedom of 
choice taken away by the MAGA Su-
preme Court, a nationwide abortion 
ban was actually their attempt to seem 
more mainstream. Can you believe it? 
To seem more mainstream? Heaven 
help us. Heaven help us. It shows just 
how extreme they are. 
The core problem is that far from 
being mainstream, a large portion of 
the Republican Party harbors truly ex-
treme views on a woman’s right to 
choose. In the few months since the 
Dobbs decision, Republican State legis-
latures in places like Indiana, South 
Carolina, and others have either intro-
duced or enacted new abortion restric-
tions, with alarmingly few exceptions 
of rape or incest. 
In this Chamber, Senate Republicans 
spent years confirming judges hostile 
to freedom of choice, including three 
sitting Supreme Court Justices who 
joined with the majority in over-
turning Roe. And the then-majority 
leader, now minority leader, Leader 
MCCONNELL, has repeatedly said his 
greatest accomplishment is putting 
these judges on the Court. His greatest 
accomplishment is putting judges on 
the Court who overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Do the American people want that? I 
don’t think so. 
And for all the hemming and hawing 
we heard yesterday from Republicans 
about where they really stand on the 
issue, they cannot run away from their

September 14, 2022 
record. Setting aside yesterday’s pro-
posal, the fact is that 45 Senate Repub-
licans—including Leader MCCONNELL— 
remain cosponsors of another nation-
wide abortion ban previously intro-
duced by the Senator from South Caro-
lina. 
Leader MCCONNELL himself told USA 
Today earlier this year that without 
Roe, proposals for a nationwide ban on 
abortions were now ‘‘possible,’’—his 
words—‘‘possible’’ if Republicans con-
trolled the Senate. Do the American 
people 
want 
that? 
Do 
they 
want 
MCCONNELL, Leader MITCH MCCONNELL, 
to be majority leader and work to im-
pose a nationwide ban on abortions? I 
don’t think so. 
Now, they are sort of running away 
from what their real beliefs are, but 
they are like the dog who caught the 
bus. For years they pushed to make 
this happen, unfortunately, to the det-
riment of over 100 million American 
women. It happened, and now they 
don’t know quite what to do. 
They are not backing off their hor-
rible MAGA principles, but they want 
to hide from it at the same time be-
cause they know how unpopular it is. 
And to show you just where the party 
is at, almost immediately after the 
Court overturned Roe, Mike Pence, 
former Republican Vice President, now 
running for President possibly in 2024 
said Republicans ‘‘must not rest’’ until 
abortion is illegal everywhere. That 
means a nationwide ban. That doesn’t 
leave it up to the States. 
In fact, he doubled down on just this 
last night, saying a national abortion 
ban ‘‘is profoundly more important’’ 
than Republicans’ short-term interests. 
That is one of the leaders of the Repub-
lican Party, which has moved so far to 
the right that even someone like 
Pence, who doesn’t always go along 
with Trump, feels compelled to take 
that extreme position. 
And lest we forget, folks, nearly 
every Senate Republican—nearly every 
Senate Republican—already voted to 
push national abortion bans in 2020, in 
2018, and 2015. During one of these 
votes, the Senator from South Caro-
lina, who introduced the nationwide 
ban again yesterday, said: 
These pieces of legislation will continue to 
be advanced until they pass. 
How do we know that Republicans 
will put a national abortion ban on the 
floor if they control the Senate? Not 
only has Senator GRAHAM committed 
to doing it, they have done it before, 
three times. And they will do it again 
if they get the majority. America, be-
ware. America, beware. 
So the truth is not hard to grasp. Re-
publicans do not care about leaving 
abortion in the hands of the States. No 
way. They do not care that a majority 
of Americans supported Roe and sup-
port abortion rights. 
What MAGA Republicans care about 
deep down is eliminating freedom of 
choice across America, period. And 
they are already at work right now on 
legislation, as we heard yesterday, that 
will take us down that terrible, terrible 
path. 
Well, it is my view that the Amer-
ican people aren’t going to be fooled by 
Republicans’ desperate attempts to 
seem mainstream. You can’t fake your 
way through an issue so personal and 
so important as a woman’s right to 
make her own healthcare choices. They 
are not going to be able to run and 
duck and bob and weave and tie them-
selves 
in 
pretzel 
knots. 
Everyone 
knows where they are at. LINDSEY GRA-
HAM made it clear again yesterday. And 
people will know the Republican view: 
abolish abortion everywhere. That is 
not going to change no matter what 
some on the other side might think. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT OF 2022 
Mr. President, now, on the positive 
impacts of the Democratic agenda, a 
much happier note. As I said a moment 
ago, while MAGA Republicans spent 
yesterday touting their extreme agen-
da, Democrats focused on the things 
that matter most right now to the 
American people: lowering costs, cre-
ating good-paying jobs, and protecting 
our planet for future generations. 
The Inflation Reduction Act has not 
been law for even a month—not just a 
month—and already it is spurring new 
investments that will generate years, if 
not decades, of robust economic activ-
ity, in industries that will stay here in 
America—here in America, not in 
China, not anywhere else—for a very 
long time. 
A remarkable number of companies 
in the energy, automotive, and clean 
tech sectors have announced that they 
are either approving or accelerating 
new plans to grow their businesses. 
One of the most significant areas of 
activity is happening in EVs and bat-
tery 
manufacturing, 
so 
crucial 
to 
meeting our country’s growing demand 
for electric vehicles. China has domi-
nated battery manufacturing for too 
long, and we are bringing these jobs 
back to America—not just talking 
about it, doing it. 
Honda and LG, for instance, have 
teamed up to invest $4 billion for a new 
battery plant with an annual produc-
tion of 40 GWh. 
Hyundai, meanwhile, has announced 
they might actually accelerate their 
timetable for building new state-of- 
the-art EV and battery plants in Sa-
vannah, GA. Plans called for getting 
started early next year, and now they 
are saying it could happen sooner. And 
it is the votes of people and the activ-
ity of people like RAPHAEL WARNOCK 
and JON OSSOFF that have made that 
happen. 
Of course, the benefits of our bill ex-
tend well beyond EVs and batteries. 
Solar Energy Industries Association 
projects that by 2027, the U.S. solar 
market will grow 40 percent more than 
expected thanks to the Inflation Re-
duction Act. And numerous companies 
focused on renewables, carbon capture, 
and heat pumps are announcing a flur-
ry of investments, very often citing our 
bill—now law—the IRA. 
All of these examples share some-
thing important: These are the jobs of 
tomorrow. These industries are going 
to stick around for decades as our 
country makes the transition away 
from fossil fuels and towards cleaner 
forms of energy. The impacts will be 
felt everywhere. It is going to take mil-
lions of workers to build these vehicles, 
reshape our infrastructure, and install 
these technologies in our homes and of-
fices. 
And because so much of this will be 
done by union labor, these will be good- 
paying jobs, at good wages, with good 
benefits, lifting up the middle class, 
keeping those who are in the middle 
class there and allowing many others 
who are climbing that ladder to get 
into the middle class and stay there. It 
is a wonderful and beautiful thing. In a 
certain sense we did the right thing 
making sure our planet doesn’t burn 
up, but it had so many other effects, 
like good-paying jobs and strength-
ening the middle class. 
And had we not taken action to en-
courage these investments, it is likely 
many of these jobs would end up going 
overseas to Asia, to Europe. America 
would have lost out. Instead, we have a 
real chance to lead the way again. 
This is the result of Democrats lead-
ing the way here in Congress. We are 
proud, every one of us is proud of the 
steps we have taken to lower energy 
costs, to create jobs that have a real 
future in this country, and to give 
working families a chance to climb up 
those ladders and get into that middle 
class. 
It is all about restoring that sunny 
American optimism that has been at 
the core of our economic prosperity for 
so long, that some felt had passed us 
by; but, no, we Democrats said it 
hasn’t passed us by. The best of our fu-
ture is yet to come. 
RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
Mr. President, on marriage equality, 
over the past few months, both sides 
have engaged in good-faith conversa-
tions about how to pass marriage 
equality into law. I truly hope, for the 
sake of tens of millions of Americans, 
that there will be at least 10 Repub-
licans who will vote with us to pass 
this important bill soon. 
Democrats are ready to make it hap-
pen and willing to debate reasonable 
compromises on the specifics, so I urge 
my colleagues on the other side to join 
us. Around the country, the feeling is 
sinking in that this is a dark time for 
individual rights, so codifying mar-
riage equality is one of the best things 
we can do to provide peace of mind to 
millions of Americans who are gay 
Americans, LGBTQ Americans who are 
married, and to their families, to their 
friends. It extends way beyond the indi-
vidual couple who is married. It is an 
issue that hits home for many of us in 
this Chamber, including me. 
If we ever find ourselves in the awful 
situation of having marriage equality 
overturned by the Supreme Court, I 
dare say the vast majority of us would

see impacts in our own personal lives 
or the personal lives of our close family 
and friends in one way or another. 
It would be risky and perhaps foolish 
to think that such a day could never 
come. Maybe a few months ago people 
would think that, no more. Justice 
Thomas put his cards on the table. He 
said that he is very open that the Su-
preme 
Court’s 
decision 
protecting 
same-sex marriage should, in fact, be 
reconsidered. And often when Justice 
Thomas says it, his other four MAGA 
Republican Supreme Court colleague 
Justices are thinking the same thing. 
To anyone who says that the High 
Court would never be so reckless as to 
overturn a decision that has protected 
this fundamental right of millions of 
people, all I say to this is: Wake up. 
Look what they did in the Dobbs deci-
sion. 
Passing marriage equality in the 
Senate is all about making sure such a 
danger 
never—never—materializes. 
Millions of Americans, tens of millions 
of Americans will breathe a huge sigh 
of relief if we do this. And it is the 
right thing to do. 
We know that America has trod on 
the long path towards greater equality. 
We know that when the Constitution 
was written, millions of Americans 
were enslaved. In many States, you had 
to be a White male Protestant property 
owner to vote, that would leave the 
presiding officer and me out. They 
know that, and they know that most 
Americans are proud that we have 
made progress. 
There are some dark forces encap-
sulated, embodied in the MAGA Repub-
licans, so many of whom are in this 
Chamber, who want to take steps back-
ward. We are not going to let it hap-
pen. We shouldn’t let it happen. 
So I truly hope, for the sake of tens 
of millions of Americans, that there 
will be at least 10 Republicans who will 
vote with us to pass this very, very im-
portant bill. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican leader is recog-
nized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
American people’s No. 1 priority is run-
away inflation that is smashing their 
family budgets and crushing our econ-
omy. 
Yesterday, the latest inflation report 
showed that soaring prices are still 
completely out of control. Inflation has 
totaled 13.2 percent since the day 
President Biden took office. We just 
had the worst 12 months for both food 
inflation and electricity inflation since 
the fallout from the Carter administra-
tion. 
President Biden and our Democratic 
colleagues chose to celebrate—cele-
brate—this awful inflation report with 
a so-called inflation reduction party 
yesterday at the White House. While 
the Dow Jones plummeted over 1,000 
points, while the S&P 500 lost more 
than 4 percent of its value in 1 day, 
while American families can’t afford 
gas, groceries, or electricity, Wash-
ington Democrats partied on the White 
House lawn to celebrate their policies. 
That is what happened yesterday. 
This is what Democrats do while our 
economy crumbles. They subsidize lux-
ury electric cars; they make plumbers 
and retail workers eat the graduate 
school debt of doctors and lawyers; and 
they throw a party for themselves on 
the White House lawn. 
CRIME 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, when you combine the 
border crisis and the violent crime cri-
sis, law and order ranks as the Amer-
ican people’s No. 2 priority, second 
only to the inflation crisis. 
While Democrats’ economic policies 
have waged war on working families’ 
financial security, their soft-on-crime 
policies have eroded America’s phys-
ical security. Cities, towns, and neigh-
borhoods across the country are reeling 
from a wave of violent crime. Just last 
weekend my State, Kentucky, experi-
enced a spate of murders and at-
tempted murders that rattled residents 
and literally overwhelmed the police. 
Lexington saw four separate shooting 
incidents on Saturday night alone, 
leaving nine hurt, some with life- 
threatening injuries. A Lexington Po-
lice Department veteran described it as 
‘‘a pretty much unprecedented night in 
my 20 years.’’ Officers were so tied up 
that they were unable to respond to 
other crimes and disorder. 
Louisville also saw a flurry of vio-
lence: the second highest number of 
homicides in one weekend this year; six 
people murdered in just 3 days. 
Both cities documented record homi-
cide numbers last year, and Lexington 
is on track to do so again. For Louis-
ville, this is the third consecutive year 
of triple-digit killings. 
Now, of course, this crisis isn’t just 
hitting Kentucky. These trends are na-
tionwide. 
For years, the far left has impugned 
the motives and honor of police officers 
and taken aim at their funding. 
For years, top liberal donors have 
poured money into campaigns of rad-
ical district attorneys from big cities 
whose whole stated agenda is to not 
prosecute crimes. 
For years, Democratic elites have 
pushed for letting violent criminals out 
of prison. Democrats just nominated 
and confirmed a Supreme Court Justice 
who argued as a DC district judge that 
COVID justified—listen to this—letting 
every single prisoner in Washington, 
DC, custody out of jail and back on the 
streets. 
This has been an intentional, stra-
tegic campaign from the far left, and 
now 
Americans 
are 
being 
robbed, 
carjacked, assaulted, and murdered. 
Their families are being poisoned with 
illegal drugs. 
Just weeks ago, Senator RUBIO gave 
the Senate a vote to increase funding 
for fighting crime and keeping dan-
gerous criminals locked up. Every Sen-
ate Republican supported this; every 
Democrat joined on party lines to 
block it. 
Later today, our colleagues from 
Tennessee will hold a press conference 
to discuss the horrifying case of Eliza 
Fletcher, a 34-year-old mom and teach-
er in Memphis, whom a career criminal 
forced into an SUV and murdered while 
she was out for her morning run. The 
suspect had multiple violent crimes on 
his rap sheet dating back to age 14 and 
had just been let out of prison early for 
a prior kidnapping. 
So there are far too many tragic sto-
ries like Eliza Fletcher’s being written 
every day and every week all across 
our country. 
Entire neighborhoods have become 
unwalkable. In many places, public 
transit has become nearly unusable. 
A few months ago, the Washington 
Post profiled 1 day in the life of a fe-
male immigrant busdriver in Denver 
who gets screamed at and threatened 
by lunatics on a daily basis. 
Just yesterday, a 49-year-old was 
stabbed in the back while riding the 
subway in New York City after he 
asked another passenger to just quiet 
down. 
Our Democratic friends like to talk 
about fairness and compassion. There 
is nothing fair or compassionate about 
letting cities descend into violence and 
chaos. There is nothing fair or compas-
sionate about legislating like career 
criminals 
deserve 
fifth 
and 
sixth 
chances more than young mothers de-
serve the right to go out for a morning 
jog and come home alive. 
Stable prices, reliable energy, secure 
borders, and basic public safety are 
four of the most basic duties that any 
government in a civilized country owes 
its citizens. These things are the abso-
lute minimum that American families 
ought to be able to count on—the bare 
minimum—and the Democrats’ one- 
party government cannot deliver it. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. President, on another matter, it 
has been encouraging to see good news 
regarding the Ukrainian people’s fight 
to defend or reclaim their sovereignty. 
Latest reports indicate that Ukraine 
has recently liberated 2,400 square 
miles of their own territory from Rus-
sian hands. 
The sight of a democratic nation 
beating back totalitarian aggression 
continues to inspire the free world. It 
should make other thugs think twice 
about following in Putin’s footsteps. 
But, obviously, it is not nearly time to 
ease up. An axis of authoritarians is 
still pushing hard for Ukraine to fail. 
Iran is equipping the Russian mili-
tary with armed drones like the ones 
they and their proxies have used 
against American forces in Syria and 
Iraq and against our Israeli, Emirati, 
and Saudi partners. 
North Korea is reportedly refilling 
Russia’s artillery stockpiles, and the 
PRC has publicly supported Moscow’s 
narrative through every Russian atroc-
ity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4588 
September 14, 2022 
So our Ukrainian friends may still 
face a long, hard struggle to achieve 
victory as they define it, but Western 
countries can help by stepping up the 
pace of our collective assistance. 
Ukraine’s hard-won successes on the 
battlefield could have come actually 
even earlier if the Biden administra-
tion and European allies that take 
their cues from Washington had been 
quicker and more proactive to deliver 
the capabilities Ukraine actually need-
ed. 
Ukrainian forces are working won-
ders with Western equipment. They 
have quickly integrated cutting-edge 
systems like HIMARS and Javelin and 
Stinger missiles. 
The West’s hesitance to put these ca-
pabilities in the right hands has cost 
lives. Horrors could have been avoided 
if the Biden administration and our 
European partners hadn’t been self-de-
terred from providing these tools soon-
er. 
The Ukrainians need more of the 
weapons we have been giving them; 
they need to start getting them faster; 
and they also need new capabilities 
like longer range, ATACMS, larger 
drones, and tanks. 
Not all of these weapons need to 
come from America. Make no mistake, 
our allies are looking to us for signals. 
President Biden should be clear with 
Western Europe about the need for 
them to make meaningful, specific con-
tributions to Ukraine and to do it 
quickly. 
He should be clear with our allies 
that our defense holiday is over. It is 
time for all of us to rebuild our mili-
taries and defense industrial bases. 
This will take urgent investments, reg-
ulatory reform, and prioritization to 
expand our capacity to produce critical 
munitions and systems. These short- 
and long-term steps alike are in Eu-
rope’s vital interests, America’s vital 
interests, and the entire free world’s. 
Beijing, Tehran, and other authori-
tarian regimes cannot think for 1 
minute that trampling free people’s 
sovereignty will go unpunished. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF LARA E. MONTECALVO 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleagues who voted yester-
day, on a bipartisan basis, to advance 
the nomination of Lara Montecalvo to 
be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the First Circuit. I look forward to 
her confirmation later today. 
She will soon fill the seat that is 
being vacated by Judge O. Rogeriee 
Thompson, who is a trailblazing and 
outstanding jurist whom I was proud to 
recommend and who is taking senior 
status. She will continue to hear cases 
on a more limited basis, along with 
Judge Bruce Selya, another distin-
guished judge from Rhode Island who 
has taken senior status and who con-
tinues to hear cases on the First Cir-
cuit. 
Like Judge Thompson and Judge 
Selya, Lara Montecalvo is someone 
with great integrity, intellect, and ca-
pacity for judicial independence. I am 
delighted that President Biden nomi-
nated her for Rhode Island’s tradi-
tional seat on the First Circuit. I am 
pleased that the Judiciary Committee 
reported her nomination on a bipar-
tisan vote. And I am grateful to my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
who voted yesterday to advance her 
nomination. 
Her resume speaks for itself. As 
Rhode Island’s chief public defender, 
Ms. Montecalvo has demonstrated an 
unwavering commitment to upholding 
our constitutional rights, including the 
Fifth Amendment right to due process 
and the Sixth Amendment right to 
counsel. 
Ms. Montecalvo was a gifted student, 
who holds degrees from Swarthmore 
College 
and 
Boston 
College 
Law 
School, where she graduated magna 
cum laude in 2000. 
After graduating from law school, 
she was immediately drawn to public 
service. She started her legal career at 
the Department of Justice for 4 years, 
focusing on civil tax matters in the 
Federal courts. In 2004, she joined the 
Rhode Island Public Defender’s Office 
and has risen through the ranks to lead 
that office. 
Ms. Montecalvo has more than 20 
years of experience as a trial and ap-
pellate attorney. She has appeared in 
just about every court in Rhode Island, 
including in the State’s highest court. 
Her extensive courtroom experience 
will add valuable perspectives to the 
deliberations of the First Circuit. 
But it is more than her resume. 
Within the Rhode Island legal commu-
nity, Ms. Montecalvo is known for her 
zealous advocacy for her clients and 
her keen sense of justice. She has won 
accolades from judges, prosecutors, and 
law enforcement officials. And individ-
uals across the political spectrum have 
endorsed her nomination, including 
five Rhode Island attorneys general 
and two former U.S. attorneys, one ap-
pointed by President Obama and one by 
President Trump. 
I know Ms. Montecalvo will serve on 
the First Circuit with honor and dis-
tinction as she has at every step of her 
legal career. 
I urge my colleagues to confirm this 
highly qualified nominee to serve as a 
judge on the First Circuit. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
AGRICULTURE AND INFLATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, yester-
day afternoon, Democrats and the 
President gathered at the White House 
to celebrate their so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act—a bill that will do abso-
lutely nothing to reduce inflation. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it. The nonpartisan Penn Wharton 
Budget Model said this about the bill’s 
impact on inflation: 
The impact on inflation is statistically in-
distinguishable from zero. 
‘‘[S]tatistically 
indistinguishable 
from zero.’’ 
Or you could take the word of the 
Democrat chairman of the Senate 
Budget Committee, who admitted on 
the Senate floor right here that the so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act would 
not reduce inflation. That is right. 
To describe yesterday’s celebration 
at the White House as tone deaf would 
be putting it mildly. Democrats had a 
big party to celebrate a bill that may 
fulfill some of their Big Government 
fantasies but will do nothing to fix the 
inflation crisis facing our country. 
Meanwhile, Americans were dealing 
with the release of August inflation 
numbers, which were even higher than 
expected and made it very clear that 
the soaring prices will continue for the 
foreseeable future. 
One of President Obama’s top eco-
nomic advisers noted yesterday: 
Today’s CPI report confirms that the US 
has a serious inflation problem. Core infla-
tion is higher this month than for the quar-
ter, higher this quarter than last quarter, 
higher this half of the year than the previous 
one, and higher last year than the previous 
one. 
That 
is 
from 
one 
of 
President 
Obama’s top economic advisers, who 
made that statement yesterday. 
Yet Democrats and the President 
somehow thought yesterday was a good 
day to celebrate fulfilling some of their 
Big Government fantasies. 
I guess Americans struggling to af-
ford their soaring grocery bills can be 
comforted by the fact that, thanks to 
Democrats’ legislation, their tax dol-
lars will now be going to fund electric 
vehicle tax credits for wealthy Ameri-
cans, not to mention road equity and 
identifying gaps in tree canopy cov-
erage—yes, provisions in the bill that 
they were celebrating yesterday. Mean-
while, the pain of inflation is perme-
ating every aspect of our economy. 
During the month of August, I spent 
a lot of time traveling around South 
Dakota, and naturally I spent a lot of 
time talking to farmers and ranchers. 
One thing I heard over and over is the 
toll that inflation is taking on agri-
culture. 
In addition to the normal challenges 
every American is facing from infla-
tion, like high utility bills and high 
grocery prices, farmers and ranchers 
are facing massive increases in the 
price of essential inputs like fertilizer

and fuel. Under the Biden administra-
tion, farm production expenses will 
reach a record high this year. Fer-
tilizer prices are on track to increase 
by 84 percent—84 percent. That is a 
staggering increase. Fuel prices are on 
track to increase 65 percent. And there 
is no end in sight. 
Farmers are facing a huge increase in 
interest costs thanks to a combination 
of higher interest rates and record-high 
farm debt. Gross farm income is actu-
ally supposed to reach a record level 
this year, but those gains are expected 
to be entirely wiped out by inflation— 
and then some. Thanks to inflation, 
net farm income is expected to de-
crease. At a time when gross farm in-
come is expected to reach a record 
level—14 percent higher year over year 
than last year—net farm income, infla-
tion adjusted, is actually going to go 
down because of the impact of infla-
tion. 
Meanwhile, Democrats were at the 
White House celebrating a bill that 
will not only do nothing to address our 
inflation crisis but will drive up energy 
bills for American farmers and Amer-
ican families. 
Agriculture is the lifeblood of my 
State of South Dakota, and addressing 
the needs of farmers and ranchers is al-
ways one of my top priorities here in 
the Senate. While it is, unfortunately, 
going to be difficult to stop Democrats 
from prolonging our inflation crisis as 
long as they are in charge in Wash-
ington, in the meantime, I am doing 
everything I can to make life easier for 
our farmers and ranchers. 
One of my top priorities right now is 
preparing for the 2023 farm bill, to 
make it as effective as possible in ad-
dressing the challenges that are facing 
our farmers and ranchers. I have been 
holding roundtables in South Dakota 
to hear directly from producers about 
their priorities for the farm bill. So far, 
I have held roundtables covering row 
crops, conservation, and livestock. I 
also participated in a farm bill panel at 
Dakotafest 
and 
an Aberdeen Area 
Chamber of Commerce farm bill discus-
sion at the Brown County Fair. 
I look forward to continuing to re-
ceive input from producers as the time 
to draft the farm bill approaches. I 
have also begun introducing legisla-
tion—based on my conversations with 
farmers and ranchers—that I will work 
to get included in the farm bill. 
In March, I introduced the Conserva-
tion Reserve Program Improvement 
Act, which would make CRP grazing a 
more attractive option for farmers and 
ranchers by providing cost-share pay-
ments for all CRP practices for the es-
tablishment of grazing infrastructure, 
including fencing and water distribu-
tion. It would also increase the annual 
payment limit for CRP, which has not 
changed since 1985, to help account for 
inflation and the increase in land 
value. 
In May, I joined Senator KLOBUCHAR 
to introduce the Agricultural Innova-
tion Act. Currently, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture collects reams of 
data on conservation practices. The 
problem is that a lot of this data is 
often not analyzed and presented in a 
way that would be useful for farmers 
and ranchers. 
The legislation Senator KLOBUCHAR 
and I introduced would provide for bet-
ter processing and development of the 
data that the USDA collects so that 
farmers and ranchers can evaluate the 
impact of conservation and other pro-
duction practices on things like soil 
health, crop yields, and profitability. 
Our bill would make it easier for farm-
ers and ranchers to decide what con-
servation practices to adopt by, among 
other things, helping producers iden-
tify the ways that adopting conserva-
tion practices can improve their bot-
tom line. 
In the next couple of weeks, I will be 
introducing another piece of legisla-
tion for the 2023 farm bill to improve 
the effectiveness of livestock disaster 
assistance for producers. Too often, 
producers find that accessing disaster 
relief programs at the Department of 
Agriculture is an arduous and lengthy 
process. I am working on legislation 
that would make it easier for farmers 
and ranchers to access the Livestock 
Forage 
Disaster 
Program 
and 
the 
Emergency Conservation Program so 
that producers can receive timely as-
sistance in the wake of natural disas-
ters like drought and flooding. 
The U.S. Drought Monitor plays a 
critical role in triggering USDA dis-
aster assistance, and I am working to 
build on my previous efforts to improve 
weather monitoring and the accuracy 
of the Drought Monitor. 
This isn’t a farm bill issue per se, but 
I am also introducing legislation today 
to prevent Democrats from using fund-
ing in the recently passed and mis-
named, as I pointed out earlier, Infla-
tion Reduction Act to monitor live-
stock methane emissions. 
It is very clear that elements of the 
radical environmental left would like 
to see U.S. livestock producers out of 
business entirely. My legislation is de-
signed to forestall future attempts to 
curtail beef production by preventing 
the Biden Environmental Protection 
Agency from using funds in the Demo-
crats’ bill to monitor livestock emis-
sions. 
Agriculture is a challenging way of 
life. In addition to backbreaking work 
in all weather, our Nation’s farmers 
and ranchers have to contend with the 
uncontrollable whims of the weather, 
which can wipe out a herd or a crop in 
a day. And as if the actual challenges 
of the job weren’t enough, over the 
course of the Biden administration, our 
Nation’s farmers and ranchers have 
had to deal with soaring inflation. 
I am incredibly grateful for all the 
South Dakota farmers and ranchers 
and all of our Nation’s farmers and 
ranchers who continue to persevere 
during these difficult circumstances. I 
will continue to do everything I can in 
Washington to make their jobs easier 
and to support them as they do the es-
sential work of feeding our Nation and 
the world. 
NOMINATION OF LARA E. MONTECALVO 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate will vote to confirm Lara 
Montecalvo to serve on the First Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals. Ms. Montecalvo 
has significant litigation experience at 
both the trial and appellate level and 
will be an outstanding addition to the 
bench. 
She attended Swarthmore College 
and Boston College Law School. Ms. 
Montecalvo then worked in the Justice 
Department’s Tax Division as a trial 
attorney. 
In 
2004, 
Ms. 
Montecalvo 
began working in the Rhode Island 
Public Defender’s Office. She became 
the Rhode Island Public Defender in 
2020. 
As a DOJ trial attorney and as a 
State public defender, Ms. Montecalvo 
gained experience in both State and 
Federal court. She has tried more than 
20 cases to verdict, including 15 as sole 
counsel. In addition, she has personally 
handled more than 80 appeals. The 
American Bar Association rated her 
‘‘well qualified’’ to serve on the First 
Circuit, and she has the strong support 
of Senators Reed and Whitehouse. 
Ms. Montecalvo has shown that she is 
committed to equal justice. I will be 
supporting her and urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
Mr. THUNE. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CONFIRMATION OF E. MARTIN ESTRADA 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the confirmation of 
Martin Estrada to be U.S. attorney for 
the Central District of California. 
The Central District of California is 
the largest Federal judicial district in 
the country. It serves over 19 million 
Californians, almost twice as many 
people as the next largest district, and 
it serves about half the population of 
the State of California. 
It spans from San Luis Obispo Coun-
ty, home of Los Padres National For-
est, all the way to Riverside County 
and the Mojave Desert. It spans from 
the Pacific Ocean to the eastern border 
with Arizona and Nevada. And it is 
home to some of the most diverse com-
munities in the country. 
So having painted that picture of the 
district that it serves, you can imagine 
that to effectively serve as the chief 
Federal law enforcement officer for 
such a large and diverse district, you 
need someone with a proven track 
record of experience, of credibility with 
the community, and the character to 
fight for truth and fairness in our judi-
cial system. 
Martin Estrada is exactly the right 
person for the job. He is a proud son of 
immigrants from Guatemala. Martin 
has spent most of his life in and around 
the Central District community that 
he will now serve as U.S. attorney. 
He was raised near Costa Mesa in Or-
ange County and earned his under-
graduate degree at the University of 
California, Irvine. After earning his 
law degree at Stanford Law School, 
Martin returned home to the Central 
District, where he clerked for Federal 
District Judge Robert Timlin and then 
later for Judge Arthur Alarcon for the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. 
After spending time as an associate 
at the highly regarded Los Angeles law 
firm of Munger, Tolles & Olson, Martin 
served for 7 years as an assistant U.S. 
attorney in the Central District, work-
ing to protect communities from major 
crimes. Now, since 2014, he has been a 
partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson, and 
he has represented clients from before 
both Federal and State courts in a di-
verse array of legal practice areas. 
Meanwhile, he has maintained a sig-
nificant pro bono practice, fighting for 
equal justice and equal access to jus-
tice for Dreamers, Latinos, Native 
American students, students with dis-
abilities, and more. He has excelled at 
every stage of his career, and he is 
more than qualified to serve as U.S. at-
torney for California’s Central District. 
I have no doubt that he will bring a 
temperament, intelligence, and work 
ethic worthy of the community he will 
now once again serve. 
I want to thank all of you, col-
leagues. I want to thank you for sup-
porting his confirmation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4845 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in the last 
few weeks, students in Uvalde and the 
rest of Texas started a new school year. 
Three and a half months ago, on May 
24, 19 innocent children and 2 teachers 
were murdered by a deranged, evil gun-
man. 
There are no words to describe a 
monster who enters a school and mur-
ders little children—19 children, 19 
families in Uvalde who lost their little 
boys and their little girls, 2 teachers 
who are no longer here with us. 
I was in Uvalde the day after the 
shooting. I sat down with local officials 
and law enforcement. I went to the 
prayer vigil that night where the en-
tire Uvalde community came together, 
praying, weeping, and mourning the 
unbelievable loss of those 19 precious 
children and 2 teachers. 
The Uvalde shooting was the dead-
liest school shooting in Texas history. 
Before that, I was in Santa Fe, where 
yet another evil madman killed eight 
students and two teachers. I was also 
at 
Sutherland 
Springs, 
the 
worst 
church shooting in U.S. history. I was 
in El Paso. I was in Midland-Odessa. I 
was in Dallas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4591 
September 14, 2022 
There have been too damn many 
mass shootings. With kids going back 
to school all across the country, we 
need to again revisit what we can do to 
keep them safe from mass shooters. 
Many students, especially in Uvalde, 
are scared. Their parents are scared, 
and they have expressed concerns that 
the security measures at schools in 
Uvalde haven’t improved enough to 
make them feel safe. 
Today, I want to put forth two bills 
that would address this problem. 
Inevitably, when a mass murder oc-
curs, Democrats in this Chamber and 
the media implore Congress: Do some-
thing. 
Well, in just a moment, the Senate 
can do something. The first bill I am 
going to ask this body to pass is the 
Secure Our Schools Act, which would 
spend unused COVID education funds 
on hiring police officers in schools and 
hiring school-based mental health pro-
fessionals. This bill would be the most 
serious, the most significant, the most 
major investment in school security 
Congress has ever enacted. This bill 
would double the number of police offi-
cers on campus. So if, God forbid, the 
next deranged madman shows up try-
ing to commit murder, before that 
madman gets into the school, into the 
classroom, he would encounter an 
armed police officer who could stop 
him outside the school before he com-
mits murder. 
This bill also funds $10 billion for 
15,000 new mental health counselors in 
schools. So many of these deranged 
killers have a long and horrifying de-
scent into mental illness before they 
commit their crimes. We see the pat-
tern of the lone, alienated, angry, de-
ranged, young man who seeks to com-
mit the most unspeakable evil. If we 
had additional mental health resources 
on campuses, they would be in a posi-
tion to spot the warning signs, to see 
the young man heading down that dan-
gerous path, and to intervene and stop 
them. 
Recently, the National Center for 
Education Statistics, which is part of 
the U.S. Department of Education, 
found that 88 percent of public schools 
did not ‘‘strongly agree’’ when asked 
whether they had the funding and the 
mental health professionals they need-
ed in the schools. Eighty-eight percent 
said: We need more mental health pro-
fessionals in schools and more funding 
to hire them. 
My bill would address both of these 
problems by ensuring that we are dou-
bling the number of police officers so 
there are armed police officers to pro-
tect our kids and keep them safe and so 
there are mental health counselors to 
spot a dangerous young man before he 
goes down the road of committing a 
horrific mass murder. 
This bill is common sense, and in a 
sane political environment, it would be 
passed 100 to nothing. 
My 
colleague 
Senator 
BARRASSO 
wants to make some additional re-
marks on our bill. So I yield the floor 
to Senator BARRASSO. 
(Ms. ROSEN assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. BARRASSO. Well, Madam Presi-
dent, I come to the floor today to join 
my colleague and friend from Texas in 
support of this very important piece of 
legislation. 
What happened in Uvalde was a trag-
edy. It was horrendous. I commend the 
citizens of that community for their 
strength in a time of heartache. 
Every Member of this body agrees 
that we need to find the best way to 
protect children who go to school. 
Whether 
in 
Washington, 
DC, 
or 
Wheatland, WY, we need to find a way 
to protect those students. 
That is why Senator CRUZ and I have 
introduced the Safe Kids, Safe Schools, 
Safe Communities Act of 2022. Our bill 
provides the kind of safety and the 
kind of security that our children, our 
schools, and our communities des-
perately need. And we do this while al-
ways 
protecting 
the 
constitutional 
rights of law-abiding Americans. 
Now, as a doctor who served in our 
State legislature in Wyoming and now 
in this body, I have seen the dev-
astating impact of mental health chal-
lenges, and Senator CRUZ talked spe-
cifically about those, and that is why 
we addressed them in this bill. I have 
seen how much those challenges con-
tribute and what we have seen in these 
terrible acts. Our bill would make a 
difference—make a difference by pro-
viding 
mental 
health 
professionals 
with the resources they need to iden-
tify and to address these behavioral 
health needs of our students. 
Our bill would hire 15,000 more men-
tal health professionals at middle 
schools and high schools. 
It also significantly increases the 
physical safety of our schools. Our bill 
would double the number of police offi-
cers in our schools. It would help 
schools buy more security equipment 
and metal detectors, door locks, and 
alarms. 
Our bill also would do all of these 
things at no cost to the taxpayer. It 
wouldn’t add to inflation. People might 
ask, how? Well, it is because our bill 
would redirect money that has already 
been 
allocated 
in 
the 
Democrats’ 
spending bills. Our bill would work, 
and it wouldn’t cost taxpayers a dime. 
School is back in session now all 
across the country, and now is the time 
to take the real action that we need to 
keep our kids and our schools safe. No 
child should live in fear of going to 
school. No parent should live in fear of 
sending their child to school. And no 
law-abiding gun owner should be denied 
his or her constitutional rights. 
So I want to thank my friend and 
colleague from Texas for introducing 
this vital piece of legislation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of S. 4845, 
which is at the desk; further, that the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
passed and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, I 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, what 
we just saw on this floor was stunning. 
I am genuinely at a loss for words. 
This bill is common sense. There is 
not a constituent in Texas or Nevada 
or Connecticut who, if you asked: 
Would it be a good thing to have more 
police officers keeping our kids safe, 
wouldn’t say: Of course it would. There 
is not a constituent of ours who, if you 
asked: Would it be a good thing to have 
more mental health counselors on cam-
pus to stop people from committing 
crimes, wouldn’t say: Of course it 
would. 
I was informed a few days ago that 
when I was going to seek unanimous 
consent, the Senator from Connecticut 
was going to object. Now, the Senator 
from Connecticut styles himself the 
leading advocate of gun control in the 
U.S. Senate. 
I was asked by reporters: Why are the 
Democrats objecting to this? 
I will tell you what I told reporters: 
I have no idea. They haven’t said. They 
haven’t told me why they object to it. 
So I was genuinely looking forward 
to seeing the Senator from Connecti-
cut’s remarks. I was sitting here wait-
ing to see, why do you oppose more po-
lice officers to keep our kids safe? Why 
do you oppose mental health coun-
selors in schools? 
I have been in the Senate 10 years. 
The Senator from Connecticut and I 
were elected at the same time. I have 
engaged in many debates on this floor, 
including with the Senator from Con-
necticut. The fact that he chose not to 
say a word about why he objects is 
stunning. I find myself genuinely flab-
bergasted. 
I will say that one of reasons I think 
the Senator from Connecticut feels 
content not only not to argue but now 
to walk off the floor and not even lis-
ten to the debate he is ostensibly par-
ticipating in, one of reasons he feels 
free to do so is, if you look up in the 
Senate Gallery—I can count them— 
there are precisely zero reporters in 
this Gallery. Not a single one of the 
corporate media will report on this, 
and I think the Senator from Con-
necticut feels absolutely certain, when 
he walks out, he will have reporters 
that will say: Tell me how terrible 
Donald Trump is. 
He will lean in and say: Oh, Donald 
Trump is really terrible. 
But not one of the reporters will ask: 
Hey, wait a second, why don’t you want 
police officers keeping our kids safe? 
None of them will. The Democrats 
are protected by a dishonest army of 
propagandists in the corporate media. 
CNN will not have a panel sitting 
around discussing why is it that the

September 14, 2022 
Democrats simply do not care to de-
fend their positions. 
Let me tell you, when there is a mass 
murdering and the Democrats stand up 
and give speeches and they point at Re-
publicans and say: Blood is on your 
hands, it is great political rhetoric. It 
is dishonest, but, boy, it gins up their 
donors. It gets people to go and write 
checks to Democrats and fund their 
campaigns. 
What we just saw reveals that Demo-
crats have one objective when a mass 
murder happens, and that is to take 
away the Second Amendment rights of 
law-abiding citizens. That is always, 
always, always their solution. Never 
mind that it doesn’t work. Never mind 
that it doesn’t stop violent crime. 
Never mind that if you look at the ju-
risdictions across the country with the 
strictest gun control laws, almost 
every single one of them consistently 
has among the highest crime rates and 
murder rates. 
Earlier this year, the Senator from 
Connecticut authored his big gun con-
trol package, rammed it through this 
body—a package which will do nothing, 
zero, to stop mass murders. We will see 
another mass murder. I pray that we 
don’t, but evil exists in the world, and 
if another lunatic attacks a school, and 
there is not a police officer at the front 
door to stop him, remember right now. 
Remember this moment when the 
Democrats said: No, we will not protect 
our kids. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4586 
Madam President, there are lots of 
arguments the Senator from Con-
necticut could have made. He chose to 
make none of them. 
If he does not like how the money in 
this bill is specifically spent, I am now 
going to propound a second unanimous 
consent bill. 
There is right now $135 billion in 
unspent COVID relief funds to schools. 
Under the rules the Democrats have 
put in place, those funds cannot be 
spent on school security. 
The second bill that I am going to 
ask this body to pass is a bill that is 
very simple. It is one page. It says 
schools can spend some of that $135 bil-
lion on school security. They can de-
cide what to spend it on, but if they de-
cide they want to hire an additional 
police officer, they can spend the 
money on that. If they decide they 
want to enhance the physical security 
of their campus to make their students 
safer, they can spend it on that. They 
can invest in school security. Right 
now, the Democrats have blocked them 
from doing this. 
These are funds Congress has already 
appropriated that haven’t been spent. 
And this bill is unbelievably simple. It 
says the schools can choose to invest in 
school security. 
Therefore, as if in legislative session, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Health, Education, Labor, 
and Pensions be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 4586 and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration; further, that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Madam President, the 
Senator is right—I am not going to en-
gage in a colloquy on the merits of this 
request or the previous request. This 
isn’t real. This is a TV show. This is 
click bait. This is theater. This isn’t an 
actual attempt to pass legislation. 
Senator LANKFORD
approached me 
about this particular bill on the floor a 
week ago and asked to engage in a dia-
logue with me about it. I thought it 
was a legitimate request, and I set my 
team to the task of trying to work 
something out with Senator LANKFORD. 
And now there is a unanimous consent 
request to pass a bill that is under ne-
gotiation and discussions between seri-
ous legislators who actually want to 
find a result. 
So, no, I am not going to debate the 
merits of these UCs. This isn’t real. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, the 
Senator from Connecticut just gave us 
the sum total of his wisdom as he 
walks off the floor again, which is, he 
says this isn’t real. 
The Presiding Officer is well aware of 
how the Senate operates. When a Sen-
ator arises for a unanimous consent re-
quest, one of two things happens: A 
Senator objects, or the bill passes. 
I have stood on this floor and passed 
unanimous consent requests because 
our colleagues chose not to object. 
One of the more notable instances 
was following multiple instances in the 
House of House Democrats making 
anti-Semitic comments. The House 
tried to pass a resolution condemning 
anti-Semitism. Sadly, the radical left 
in the Democratic caucus objected, and 
the House Democrats couldn’t pass a 
resolution condemning anti-Semitism. 
I joined with our colleague Senator 
KAINE from Virginia, a Democrat. We 
authored a resolution, the Cruz-Kaine 
resolution—a 
bipartisan 
resolution 
that was a clear and unequivocal con-
demnation of anti-Semitism. It con-
demned BDS as anti-Semitism. It con-
demned 
explicitly 
the 
anti-Semitic 
comments made by those House Demo-
crats at the outset of the dispute. 
When Senator KAINE and I came to 
the Senate floor, we did not know if a 
Senator would object. There were nu-
merous Senators in this body who did 
not join the resolution and could easily 
have walked out on the floor and ob-
jected. We stood up and asked unani-
mous consent, and much to our very 
pleasant surprise, the opposing party 
chose not to object, and the resolution 
passed. It passed 100 to nothing. 
When the Senator from Connecticut 
says this isn’t real, the only reason 
this bill has not passed the U.S. Senate 
is because the Senator from Con-
necticut stood up and uttered two 
magic words: I object. Had he done 
something really simple—just shut up, 
just shut his mouth, just sat there—we 
would be standing in a position where 
both of these bills would have passed 
into law. 
What does it say about the Demo-
crats’ view of the American people that 
they don’t engage in debate, they don’t 
engage in discussion, they don’t defend 
their positions? They, instead, arro-
gantly say no and have full confidence 
that their compliant cheerleaders in 
the media will never even tell anyone 
about it. 
I don’t know how you defend the po-
sition he just took. I was genuinely 
looking forward to hearing some form 
of an argument. 
I can tell you, when I forced a vote 
on the Cruz-Barrasso bill on this floor 
and the Democrats voted, party line, 
no, we don’t want more police officers 
in school; no, we don’t want more men-
tal health counselors in school; no, we 
don’t 
want 
additional 
funding 
for 
school safety, to the best of my knowl-
edge, no reporter asked a single Demo-
crat: Why are you leaving our kids vul-
nerable? Why aren’t you acting to pro-
tect children in school? Because, you 
know what, there is no money on the 
left for actually stopping these crimes. 
The money is for disarming law-abid-
ing citizens. It is a narrow-minded, po-
litical focus. 
We could have just passed the most 
significant school safety legislation 
ever passed by the Federal Govern-
ment. Why didn’t we? Because the 
Democrats objected. That objection is 
wrong, it is irresponsible, and it shows 
a willingness to play political games 
while demonstrating contempt for our 
constituents. 
Today, the U.S. Senate failed the 
American people. Today, the U.S. Sen-
ate failed the schoolchildren of Amer-
ica. And I pray that the consequences 
are not truly horrific. I pray that this 
body will show up and do its damn job: 
Debate real issues and pass real legisla-
tion that will actually stop crime rath-
er than the empty political gestures of 
the left. 
I yield the floor.

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, ‘‘Help 
Wanted.’’ I see the signs in nearly 
every county I visit in Iowa on my 99- 
county tour. Small businesses and pub-
lic services are struggling to maintain 
the workforce that is vital to our com-
munities. 
The 
Des 
Moines 
Public 
School District, for example, has over 
100 vacancies and is providing $50,000 
incentives for retiring teachers, nurses, 
and administrators to stay in school. 
Faced with a declining number of sol-
diers, the Iowa National Guard is offer-
ing signing bonuses to new recruits,

along with other incentives to encour-
age current members to reenlist. 
Police departments across the State 
are also facing recruitment challenges 
so the Iowa State Patrol is raising sal-
aries and starting outreach efforts with 
kids as young as the sixth grade to get 
them to start thinking about careers in 
law enforcement. 
And this need for essential workers, 
well, it isn’t limited to just Iowa. 
America is facing a shortage of teach-
ers, doctors, nurses, childcare pro-
viders, construction workers, truck-
drivers, pilots, and even accountants. 
And with the Democrats’ latest tax- 
and-spend spree, a shortage of account-
ants is something taxpayers every-
where now need to be concerned about. 
The Democrats’ response to the nation-
wide need for essential workers is to 
hire 87,000 new IRS agents. The reck-
less tax-and-spending bill passed by DC 
Democrats last month more than dou-
bles the size of the IRS, which already 
has nearly 80,000 full-time employees. 
So what are the new IRS agents 
being hired to do? Well, audit America, 
of course—and very aggressively, if a 
recent job announcement on the Agen-
cy’s website is any indication. The IRS 
says it is seeking armed accountants 
willing to participate in ‘‘life-threat-
ening situations on the job.’’ 
The nonpartisan Congressional Budg-
et Office says, with the supersized 
staff, the IRS audit rate ‘‘would rise 
for all taxpayers,’’ regardless of in-
come. CBO warns it will also result in 
audits of innocent Americans who have 
paid all of their taxes and don’t owe 
the IRS a cent. That is right. Even if 
you have paid your taxes, you still 
could be subjected to an unfair and 
costly audit by the Biden administra-
tion’s army of IRS agents. 
Folks, Washington doesn’t need any 
more tax collectors; it needs to sim-
plify the Tax Code. If it wasn’t so com-
plicated to calculate your tax bill, it 
would be a lot easier to complete your 
return and avoid making mistakes. 
Ironically, hundreds of employees at 
the IRS itself may have willfully failed 
to pay their own tax bills, including 
tax collectors and even a criminal in-
vestigator. In total, 1,250 IRS employ-
ees were identified who had not paid 
their tax bills in full or on time by the 
Treasury Inspector General for Tax Ad-
ministration. More than 300 of these 
employees were repeat offenders. Yet 
the tax-collecting Agency did little to 
discipline the tax evaders on its very 
own payroll. 
The IRS staffers gave a variety of ex-
cuses for not paying their taxes, in-
cluding forgetting to report all of their 
income 
or 
being 
unable 
to 
use 
TurboTax. Yep, folks, you heard that 
right. We have a real problem if the 
IRS staff who enforce the tax law 
aren’t paying their own taxes and can’t 
even understand how to properly fill 
out their own tax forms. 
I have heard enough of the excuses 
and these Washington double stand-
ards. That is why I have asked the in-
spector general to audit the IRS to en-
sure that the tax collectors themselves 
are paying the taxes they owe, and, on 
behalf of taxpayers in Iowa and the 
rest of the country, I am grateful that 
the IG has agreed. 
Before Biden’s army of auditors 
starts harassing innocent taxpayers, 
let’s first make sure that tax collectors 
have paid their own taxes. 
And if the threat of being audited 
wasn’t bad enough, the reckless tax- 
and-spend bill also increases taxes, 
which will further add to the burden of 
small businesses already struggling 
with the higher costs resulting from 
Bidenomics. And that is the real issue. 
Washington’s misplaced priorities are 
creating problems for the rest of Amer-
ica. 
No one in Iowa whom I talk to is beg-
ging for more IRS auditors, but I do 
hear about the urgent need for more 
teachers and daycare providers because 
these folks are absolutely essential to 
communities 
across 
Iowa. 
The 
childcare staffing crisis has an even 
bigger ripple effect on families because 
it can determine where, when, and even 
if a parent can work. Yet four in five 
childcare centers across the country 
are understaffed. This is particularly 
pressing for my home State because we 
lead the Nation in the percentage of 
families where both parents work away 
from home. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds is working hard 
to increase the availability and afford-
ability of childcare, and part of her 
plan is to pay recruitment and reten-
tion bonuses to childcare providers to 
recognize them for their hard work. 
In addition, most of Iowa’s res-
taurants and bars are also shortstaffed, 
which is resulting in reduced hours of 
service for customers and also longer 
shifts for current employees. To retain 
and attract employees, restaurants are 
increasing benefits like free meals, 
more flexible schedules, paid time off, 
and retirement contributions. And, 
folks, that is great news for these hard- 
working Iowans, but it also increases 
the cost of doing business. 
So instead of increasing taxes on 
Iowa’s small businesses to pay for the 
IRS’s new army of auditors, Wash-
ington should allow job creators to 
keep more of their own earnings which 
can be put toward hiring more of those 
essential workers—whether that be 
childcare providers, construction work-
ers, or food service employees—whom 
we all rely upon. That is the help that 
America really wants. And while my 
Democratic friends are working over-
time to audit Americans, you can rest 
assured that Republicans—we are au-
diting the IRS. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
ask to speak as if in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ABORTION 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, 
yesterday, my Republican colleagues 
introduced a national abortion ban and 
made it clear that they are coming 
after the rights of my constituents and 
they are coming after the rights of peo-
ple across the country. 
This atrocious bill threatens the peo-
ple of Kansas who just voted over-
whelmingly to protect abortion rights. 
It threatens the hundreds of thousands 
of people in Michigan who just signed a 
petition for a referendum vote to pro-
tect abortion and States like mine 
which already have strong abortion 
protections on our books. 
Up to now, Republicans have tried to 
play down their abortion extremism. 
They have tried to run away from the 
consequences of their extreme agenda, 
even as patients have been denied pre-
scriptions that they need, even as doc-
tors have been forced to wait until pa-
tients’ lives are in danger before they 
can take action, even as healthcare cri-
ses they have caused spill across State 
lines to disastrous effect. 
But despite their empty rhetoric 
about leaving it to States, the truth 
has been painfully clear: They think 
they know better than women when it 
comes to reproductive healthcare deci-
sions. They have shown, again and 
again, they do not trust women to have 
full control over their own bodies, and 
they are also willing to go after doc-
tors. 
They have blocked the most basic 
bills like Senator CORTEZ MASTO’s bill 
that would have made sure people can 
still travel to other States for legally 
available care or my bill making sure 
that doctors in States where abortion 
is legal cannot be punished for doing 
their job. 
Over and over, they have stood in the 
way of Democrats’ efforts to protect 
women’s abortion rights, and it is crys-
tal clear why. This bill shows the true 
Republican position. They want to ban 
abortion for everyone, in every single 
State, and they want to punish doctors. 
They want to put them in prison for 
doing their jobs. 
So, to anyone who lives in a blue 
State like mine, anyone who thinks 
they are safe from these attacks, here 
is the painful reality: Republicans are 
coming after your rights, and you don’t 
have to take my word for it. The Sen-
ator from South Carolina said yester-
day: 
If we take back the House and the Senate, 
I can assure you we’ll have a vote on our bill. 
There it is. It couldn’t be clearer. 
That is the MAGA agenda for all 50 
States: rights stripped away and doc-
tors in prison. 
Regardless of your circumstances, re-
gardless of what is best for your 
health, 
regardless 
of 
your 
family 
plans—of your hopes or your fears or 
your dreams for your future—Repub-
licans want to control your personal 
decisions. They don’t trust you to have 
full control over your own body. This is 
horrifying. 
When he unveiled the bill yesterday, 
the Senator from South Carolina also 
said

September 14, 2022 
I’ll make a prediction: we stay on this and 
we keep talking about it, maybe less than a 
decade from now, this will be law. 
‘‘This will be law.’’ This is the future 
that they want—a national abortion 
ban. 
Well, let me tell you something. The 
Senator from South Carolina may not 
have been paying attention, but Demo-
crats are already talking about this 
issue every week, every day, every op-
portunity. And women across the coun-
try have been with us, fighting for the 
right to abortion and fighting back 
against Republicans’ harmful attacks. 
We saw it in Kansas. We are seeing it 
in Michigan. And I am seeing it every-
where I go in Washington State. 
I have been talking to doctors and 
patients and women and men across 
our country, and they are outraged— 
outraged—that Republicans want to 
take away their rights, that Repub-
licans want to put doctors in prison. 
And I am too. I have never been mad-
der. 
So here is my message to Repub-
licans: If you want to go after my con-
stituents’ rights, if you want to go 
after women’s bodies and futures, if 
you want to pass a national abortion 
ban like this extreme bill, you are 
going to have to go through me be-
cause Democrats are going to keep 
standing up for women and men across 
the country who do not want their 
rights taken away. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam Presi-
dent, we are here today because Repub-
licans are seeking a national ban on 
abortion. And if we say it once here, we 
should say it 10 times, 100 times, be-
cause literally months ago it would 
have been virtually unimaginable— 
first, that Roe v. Wade would be struck 
down and, second, that Republicans 
would propose a national ban on abor-
tion. 
Women across Connecticut and the 
country are scared and angry. And to 
those who say those fears and outrage 
are illusory or unjustified, all you have 
to do is read their words. Listen to 
what they say. They are promising the 
American people that there will be a 
national ban on abortion. 
And to the people of Connecticut who 
think we have a safe haven because our 
legislature and Governor have coura-
geously established protections for Roe 
v. Wade and for women who come to 
Connecticut seeking abortion services 
and for doctors who depend on our safe-
guards, there will be no safe haven in 
this country—none, nowhere—if Repub-
licans go where they say, explicitly, 
they are heading. 
I trust women with their doctors and 
their clergy and their family to make 
decisions about when and whether to 
become pregnant, whether to have chil-
dren, and when to terminate a preg-
nancy short of term. I trust women— 
not the government, not politicians— 
to make these preeminently important 
decisions. 
And I promise the people of Con-
necticut I will not back down. I will 
not stand for this kind of national ban 
on abortion. 
Republicans have said, historically: 
We will let the States decide. It should 
be a matter of State legislatures mak-
ing these decisions. 
This ban on abortion takes away 
power from women and from States, 
contrary to their promises over years 
and years about States’ rights. But 
more than a theoretical or hypo-
thetical argument about the powers of 
State legislatures or the allocation of 
responsibility in our Federal system, 
this law will have destructive and cata-
strophic consequences for millions of 
women. It will impair the everyday 
lives of women and families across 
America. 
It is not just a woman’s issue. It is on 
all of us to say we will not back down; 
we will not stand for a national ban on 
abortion. 
It is part of a tireless and seemingly 
boundless campaign against women’s 
rights, but these attacks on reproduc-
tive rights and personal freedom appar-
ently know no limits. Remember, first, 
Republican-controlled 
State 
legisla-
tures moved to outlaw abortion en-
tirely, forcing women suffering from 
ectopic pregnancies to bleed out in hos-
pitals and refusing to care for child 
rape victims. But now Republicans are 
moving forward with plans to ban abor-
tion 
everywhere, 
under 
any 
cir-
cumstances, and they are wresting a 
woman’s right to make her own per-
sonal healthcare decision, sometimes a 
decision made during a devastating 
medical diagnosis out of her hands, 
putting those decisions into govern-
ment’s hands. 
Make no mistake, the 15 weeks—all 
of the technical stuff that Republicans 
invoke, doesn’t take away from the 
fact that it is a national ban that will 
eviscerate Connecticut’s law. Congres-
sional Republicans will decide whether 
or not women can access this vital 
help. 
Eliminating access to abortion serv-
ices as a result of the Dobbs decision 
has already caused devastating con-
sequences. The loss of reproductive 
services in some States has caused a 
ripple effect for healthcare providers 
across the United States, which proves, 
for anyone who doubted, that banning 
reproductive 
services 
doesn’t 
stop 
women from seeking those services. It 
just adds additional barriers and dan-
ger. In fact, it unnecessarily puts their 
lives at risk. 
This bill would place a ban on abor-
tion across the country, and it would 
include New York and Massachusetts, 
not just Connecticut and Delaware. Go 
across the country and pick those 
States where these rights have been 
protected. 
When I was in the State legislature, 
and then as attorney general, I helped 
write the law that incorporates and 
codifies Roe v. Wade in Connecticut 
statute. And now Connecticut has 
moved beyond that statute to provide a 
safe haven. But all of it would be gone. 
All of it would be overwritten by this 
law. 
Americans should have no doubt 
about where Republicans stand now on 
this issue. They want to punish women. 
They want to punish doctors. They will 
do it at the State level. They will do it 
at the national level. No State, not 
even Connecticut, is safe from this 
threat. They are coming after our laws 
in Connecticut. They are coming after 
women in Connecticut and men who be-
lieve in the rights of women as a mat-
ter of constitutional and personal free-
dom to make these decisions. 
Our laws should protect the rights of 
women seeking to make their own per-
sonal decisions about their reproduc-
tive health in consultation with med-
ical providers, and I will fight tooth 
and nail this effort and any other effort 
that seeks to control, criminalize, and 
dehumanize women making this choice 
and the healthcare providers compas-
sionately giving them care. 
The American people are in our cor-
ner. American people—whatever they 
may think about abortion in their own 
lives, for their own family, for their 
daughters or wives or others—they sup-
port the rights of those women to con-
trol their own healthcare decision. It is 
an intensely personal decision, when it 
has to be made, and sometimes a 
threat of life, something going horribly 
wrong in a pregnancy, is the reason for 
it. 
I will continue to fight for all in Con-
necticut who believe in this funda-
mental right. It is a matter of our con-
stitutional DNA in Connecticut, begin-
ning with Griswold v. Connecticut, 
which laid the groundwork for the 
right of privacy which is the underpin-
ning for that constitutional freedom. 
And all of us, I hope, will reject this ef-
fort to ban abortion in the United 
States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, in June, as we are hearing, the 
Supreme Court struck down Roe v. 
Wade, reversing nearly 50 years of law 
that 
recognized 
a 
woman’s 
funda-
mental right to reproductive freedom. 
We 
also 
know 
that 
Justice 
Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion re-
peatedly insisted that the Court’s deci-
sion would return the issue of abortion 
to the people’s elected representatives 
in the States. But this was never about 
States’ rights, really, to my rightwing 
colleagues who want to restrict a wom-
an’s fundamental rights, and we know 
that because now they are pushing for 
a national abortion ban. 
Yesterday, as we have heard, Senator 
GRAHAM introduced a strict national 
abortion ban with criminal penalties 
for doctors who provide critical care. If 
it passes, this bill will preempt the 
laws in States across the country

where abortion is still legal, including 
my own State of Nevada. In Nevada, 
our voters approved a ballot initiative 
in 1990 to enshrine a woman’s right to 
choose in our State laws. 
So what happened to my colleagues’ 
claims of respecting the rights of 
States to make that decision? Well, ap-
parently it wasn’t enough to pack the 
Court with Supreme Court Justices 
who would vote to deprive women of 
the right that they have held for 50 
years, under the guise of States’ rights. 
Now, when far-right Republicans dis-
agree with a State’s decision, like 
mine, they plan to impose their own 
laws. 
The current legislation introduced by 
Senator GRAHAM stops the people in 
pro-choice States—like mine, like Ne-
vada—from choosing to protect the 
rights of women. At the same time, it 
leaves in place stricter abortion bans 
in 14 States. 
What these far-right Republicans are 
effectively saying now is this: Anti- 
choice States, you are free to choose 
however harsh you want your abortion 
bans to be. But you pro-choice States, 
you are out of luck. Whatever the vot-
ers want in your States, it really 
doesn’t matter because we are going to 
impose our own laws. 
Look, Nevadans, as I have said, in 
1990, we worked to codify Roe v. Wade 
because we know that it is impossible 
to walk in another woman’s shoes. We 
know that for each woman, this is an 
important decision for each individual 
woman to make with her doctor, with 
her loved ones, about her healthcare, 
about her family planning. 
I do not know what another woman is 
going to go through, and I do not want 
to restrict her access to any type of 
care, nor should any of us be imposing 
our beliefs, our experiences, our reli-
gion on someone else. 
That is what this is about, and that 
is why Nevada voters voted in 1990 to 
codify Roe v. Wade and give women the 
right to make this decision. 
Right now, we are seeing some politi-
cians once again declare that they 
know what is best for every family in 
this Nation. They want to force the 
State of Nevada and other States like 
Nevada to limit women’s freedoms, 
even though voters in my State voted 
to legally protect the right to choose 
that Nevada women have had for 50 
years. 
I have been saying for months now 
that some of my colleagues would 
never be satisfied with just overturning 
Roe and that they wouldn’t rest until 
there was a national abortion ban. This 
bill shows every American that not 
only are women’s rights under attack, 
but so is the democratic process in 
States like Nevada. If we don’t have an 
abortion ban on the books, our State 
rights don’t matter. That is just unac-
ceptable. We can’t let our nieces, our 
daughters, our granddaughters grow up 
in a world where they have fewer rights 
than we have had in the past. 
So I, for one, will keep fighting back 
because this is about a fundamental 
right for American women and the will 
of people in States like Nevada to 
make that decision and help and vote 
for the right of women to choose. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. 
HIRONO. 
Madam 
President, 
when the extreme far-right Supreme 
Court overturned Roe, my Republican 
colleagues lauded this horrendous deci-
sion, claiming that a woman’s right to 
an abortion should be left to the 
States. But now they are admitting 
what we knew all along: that this was 
never about States’ rights. This has al-
ways been about Republicans using 
their power to control women and our 
bodily autonomy. 
Despite the fact that the vast major-
ity of the American public supports re-
productive freedom and despite the 
fact that voters across the country are 
overwhelmingly voting to protect this 
freedom, Republicans are pandering—I 
think that is a really good word, apt 
word—pandering—to 
the 
extreme 
MAGA base and have now introduced a 
nationwide ban on abortion after 15 
weeks. 
Why 15 weeks, you ask? Because that 
is what the senior Senator from South 
Carolina who introduced this legisla-
tion said he would ‘‘feel comfortable 
at.’’ So we now have a Republican Sen-
ator attempting to restrict the bodily 
autonomy of women across the country 
because that is what he feels com-
fortable at. It is not enough that the 
overturning of Roe has created fear and 
confusion all across the country. We 
now have the introduction of a nation-
wide abortion ban further adding to the 
chaos. 
This is not some sort of hypothetical 
debate or ‘‘hysteria,’’ as some of my 
Republican colleagues have claimed. If 
Republicans take control of the Sen-
ate, we now know what they will do. 
They will work to pass a national abor-
tion ban, which would mean even in my 
home State of Hawaii, which was the 
first State in the country to decrimi-
nalize abortion even before the Roe de-
cision—we did this in Hawaii in 1970. 
And for voters in States who are push-
ing back against their radical legisla-
tors and exercising their right to bring 
the issue of abortion to the ballot, in-
cluding States like Kansas and Michi-
gan, this bill would overrule their ef-
forts. 
But, of course, to add to their utter 
hypocrisy, if States like Texas or Mis-
sissippi want to be even more restric-
tive, even more harmful to women than 
a 15-week ban, that would be A-OK, ac-
cording to the Senator from South 
Carolina and his extreme bill. 
Allowing Republicans to regain con-
trol of Congress would be catastrophic 
not only for women, but for our entire 
country because when we women can’t 
control what we do with our bodies, of 
course this impacts our families, our 
communities, our economy. 
So this November, people are going 
to have a choice: Do you want to let 
extreme MAGA Republicans tell you 
what you can and can’t do with your 
own body, or do you want to hold these 
politicians accountable for pushing 
their far-right extreme agenda and per-
petuating the chaos, confusion, and 
fear of women, families, communities, 
and our healthcare professionals? Let’s 
not forget all the doctors who are out 
there wondering how they can provide 
the kind of care that they are trained 
to do right now, how they can do that 
in the face of this kind of ban in so 
many States across the country, not to 
mention a nationwide abortion ban. 
The chaos and confusion being experi-
enced all across the country following 
the Dobbs’ decision has only multiplied 
by this nationwide abortion ban bill. 
Talk about government overreach. I 
hear my colleagues talking about how 
it should be States’ rights or govern-
ment should not be telling us what to 
do. The word ‘‘hypocrites’’ doesn’t even 
go far enough to call them out on what 
they are doing. This is an outright at-
tack on women in this country. That is 
how I see it. That is how more and 
more women and those who support our 
right to make decisions about our own 
bodies, that is how we see it. And why? 
Because that is what is happening. 
This is literally a call to arms in our 
country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to discuss the new 
Graham legislation to create a na-
tional abortion ban. The centerpiece of 
the Senator’s argument is that Senator 
GRAHAM wants our country to believe 
that his national abortion ban is a 
moderate proposal—his words. Wrong, 
wrong, wrong. 
A moderate bill would not institute 
criminal penalties for doctors pro-
viding lifesaving medical care. That is 
what this so-called moderate bill does. 
A moderate bill would not take rights 
away from American women, no mat-
ter where they live. That is what this 
so-called moderate bill does. A mod-
erate bill would not create a presump-
tion of women’s guilt by requiring 
them to report a rape or seek coun-
seling before they get an abortion. This 
so-called moderate bill does that, too. 
Just think about that last point. If 
you are trying to assess our colleague 
from South Carolina’s argument that 
his bill is moderate, under Senator 
GRAHAM’s new restrictions, a 12-year- 
old rape victim, regardless of the terror 
she feels or the danger she faces, would 
have to find a way to report her assault 
to police before she could get the care 
she needs. That is a stunning overreach 
and there is absolutely nothing that is 
moderate about this proposal. The re-
ality is this is not a moderate proposal. 
It is an extreme proposal, way out of 
step with the overwhelming opinion of 
the American people. 
The other important argument I 
wanted to discuss was this whole mat-
ter of how so many of my colleagues on

the other side of the aisle have pledged 
loyalty—pledged loyalty—to the im-
portance of States’ rights that they are 
going to leave the decision on abortion 
to the States. But Senator GRAHAM has 
shown us that all his talk about States’ 
rights means that the States have to 
agree with Senator GRAHAM. That is 
what his idea about States’ rights is all 
about. 
His bill tramples, for example, on the 
rights of Oregonians, who sure don’t 
share Senator GRAHAM’s view on this, 
and people in many other States, 
women and men who voted to protect 
abortion, 
women’s 
healthcare, 
and 
women’s individual freedom. 
Senator GRAHAM’s bill is about con-
trol. It is about government—govern-
ment—mind these words—government 
having control over women’s bodies 
rather than women having control over 
their bodies. 
It is also clear that what has always 
been envisioned is not just a nation-
wide ban on abortions but criminal-
izing this with women and doctors at 
some point, I gather, possibly locked 
behind bars. 
It is election season and Senator 
MCCONNELL wants everybody to forget 
the Republicans’ top priorities include 
passing 
these 
extreme 
restrictions 
through Congress and the courts. I be-
lieve that Americans know better. 
When it comes to this kind of legisla-
tion that is so far removed—far re-
moved—from the moderate claim of its 
sponsor, I think we ought to recognize 
what we are looking at is a total na-
tional abortion ban, criminalization, 
and the rights of women curtailed and 
the power of government over them in-
creased. 
Senator GRAHAM’s bill is the next 
step in that direction for Republicans. 
Introducing his proposal, Senator GRA-
HAM basically confirmed that: 
If [we] take back the House and Senate, I 
can assure you we’ll have a vote [on our bill]. 
Madam President, I think we have a 
lot of speakers coming, but I think the 
American people ought to take Senator 
GRAHAM at his word. This is what his 
agenda is about. This is what he is 
going to be championing from sea to 
shining sea. I just hope we do every-
thing we can here in the Senate—in 
this country—to make sure that the 
Graham bill does not see the light of 
day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, yes-
terday, new data showed what Texans 
have known and felt for months: that 
inflation simply is not letting up. Last 
month, prices were up 8.3 percent from 
a year ago. 
Economist Larry Summers, a well- 
known former president of Harvard 
University and member of Presidential 
Cabinets, said that this CPI report, 
Consumer Price Index report, confirms 
that the United States has a serious in-
flation problem. 
Rent is up 6.7 percent. If you go to 
the grocery store to feed your family, 
groceries are 13.5 percent over what 
they were last year. If you are a senior 
citizen suffering through the hot Texas 
summer and need your air-conditioner 
to work overtime, electricity to make 
that air-conditioner run is up 16 per-
cent. Of course, that is just since last 
August, just a year ago, when we were 
already battling runaway inflation. 
But here is an even more shocking 
figure: Since President Biden took of-
fice on January 20, 2021, prices have 
risen 13 percent. So 13 cents out of 
every dollar that you earn—poof—has 
gone away. You are that much poorer. 
Your standard of living has been de-
creased by 13 percent. 
Inflation, of course, far outpaces 
wage growth, meaning the average 
American has effectively been handed a 
pay cut. A single paycheck doesn’t go 
nearly as far today as it did a year ago. 
This is exactly what was predicted by 
leading economists when our Demo-
cratic colleagues ran off with the tax-
payer credit card at the end of last 
year. They abused the rules of the Sen-
ate to spend an additional $2 trillion in 
the name of COVID relief even though 
less than 10 percent of the money was 
directly related to the pandemic. 
I want to differentiate between what 
we did together on a bipartisan basis to 
deal with COVID when we spent nearly 
$5 trillion on a bipartisan basis. There 
is no doubt this was a grave emer-
gency, a public health emergency, eco-
nomic emergency. We did what we had 
to do, and we got through it. But even 
after that, our Democratic colleagues 
couldn’t seem to kick the spending 
habits and unilaterally spent an extra 
$2 trillion. As I said, even though 10 
percent of that money was related to 
the pandemic, 90 percent, then, was un-
related. 
Then the so-called Inflation Reduc-
tion Act, which the President was cele-
brating yesterday when the stock mar-
ket fell 1,200 points—this partisan bill 
amounts to another $240 billion in un-
necessary spending, while raising taxes 
at the same time. 
As I said, our colleagues ironically 
call this bill the Inflation Reduction 
Act, and the White House chose yester-
day—the day that the latest dis-
appointing inflation figures were re-
leased—to celebrate its passage. 
Inflation Reduction Act is false ad-
vertising. The Penn Wharton economic 
review of the Inflation Reduction Act 
said there is no reduction of inflation 
for at least 2 full years, and, indeed, it 
may actually get worse. But we all 
knew this intuitively, that if you keep 
spending this much money, you are ba-
sically pouring gasoline on the infla-
tion fire. It is going to get worse and 
worse and worse, and middle-class 
working families all across this coun-
try have gotten hurt as a result. 
Since 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
took control of both Houses of Con-
gress and the White House, Texans’ 
lives have gotten harder, not easier. In-
flation I have spoken to has sky-
rocketed, real wages have fallen, and 
our economy has fallen into a reces-
sion. 
Now, this is one of the other curious 
things 
about 
defining 
terms. 
Our 
Democratic colleagues want to argue 
about whether two consecutive quar-
ters of negative GDP are actually a re-
cession or not. Well, they were when 
Republicans were in charge, but appar-
ently when Democrats are in charge, 
that definition doesn’t apply. 
Much as they tried but failed to con-
vince the American people that the In-
flation Reduction Act would actually 
reduce inflation, it didn’t, and it won’t 
anytime soon. 
Well, we know that the response to 
inflation by the Federal Reserve has 
been to raise interest rates, and they 
are projected to raise them at least 
three-quarters of 1 percent or 75 basis 
points, which will also slow down the 
economy and hurt job creation. So it 
looks like even more pain is coming. 
RAILWAY LABOR MANAGEMENT DISPUTE 
Madam 
President, 
well, 
unfortu-
nately, we are also told that there is a 
looming rail strike that will have a 
tremendously negative impact on our 
economy. Our economy, as we all 
know, depends on a network of tractor- 
trailers, planes, trains, and cargo ships 
to 
transport 
products 
around 
the 
United States and beyond. These are 
the very same transportation modes 
that make sure that your grocery store 
is fully stocked, that the manufac-
turing plants have inventory they need 
in order to make their products, and 
that, yes, our packages that we order 
show up on our front door step on time. 
But a massive disruption in rail 
transportation is likely to occur in less 
than 2 days’ time. The unions that rep-
resent more than 115,000 rail workers 
have not been able to reach a contract 
agreement with railroad companies. 
Unless they reach a breakthrough 
soon, rail workers will go on strike this 
Friday, causing a national rail shut-
down. 
If you don’t think that will have a 
negative impact on our economy on top 
of what we have already mentioned, 
think again. The rail system carries 
nearly 30 percent of America’s freight, 
everything from agriculture to retail 
products, 
heavy 
equipment, 
auto-
mobiles, coal, lumber. We are talking 
about the critical products that impact 
virtually every sector of the economy. 
It is tough to overstate the negative 
impact this will have. Just look at ag-
riculture. On the front end of produc-
tion, farmers and ranchers need fer-
tilizer, seed, animal feed, and heavy 
equipment, all of which are likely to 
travel by rail at some point. Then, at 
harvest time, our producers rely on

September 14, 2022 
timely rail service to transport their 
products to processing plants and then 
communities across the country. 
If this strike goes into effect, all of 
those shipments will be stalled, and 
this comes right as we are heading into 
the fall harvest. Farmers and ranchers 
will be left with huge amounts of prod-
ucts they can’t even transport or sell, 
many of these perishable products, 
which will simply spoil. The con-
sequence for consumers is we will con-
tinue to see empty shelves at the gro-
cery stores, along with higher prices 
due to inflation and short supply. 
But this won’t just impact us in the 
United States. Railroads move roughly 
a third of U.S. grain exports, which are 
desperately needed in global markets, 
particularly with what is happening in 
Ukraine, with Russia impeding the 
growing and transportation of grain to 
places like Africa, where people are lit-
erally starving for lack of food. The 
war in Ukraine has exacerbated this 
food insecurity. If this shutdown here 
in 
America 
goes 
into 
effect, 
the 
squeeze will be compounded and will be 
even tighter. 
Of course, this is just a snapshot of 
the impact a shutdown will have on 
one sector of the economy, but the 
same struggles will play out when it 
comes to energy, rail, manufacturing, 
automotive, and literally just about 
every other sector of the economy. 
This massive logjam will take a seri-
ous toll on our economy on top of infla-
tion and the recessionary pressures we 
are already feeling. The freight indus-
try estimates that a rail shutdown 
could cost the U.S. economy more than 
$2 billion a day—$2 billion a day. 
Our country is hurtling toward a 
logistical 
nightmare, 
and 
unfortu-
nately the Biden administration ap-
pears to be frozen and undecided about 
what to do. For years, our Democratic 
colleagues who depend on organized 
labor for a major part of their political 
support have put the demands of labor 
unions ahead of the needs of consumers 
and the rest of the American people. 
They have romanced the powerful labor 
lobby at every turn, and one of the 
fiercest union defenders now occupies 
the Oval Office. 
Now, I am not opposed to people join-
ing unions. They are entitled to collec-
tively bargain and try to advance their 
livelihood and their family’s way of 
life. But to let one special interest 
group basically create a logistical 
nightmare 
with 
this 
looming 
rail 
strike is just indefensible. 
Well, we are seeing the consequences 
of this kowtowing to organized labor 
above the interests of any and all other 
Americans. 
To hopefully prevent this looming 
crisis, President Biden has established 
an emergency Board to help reach a 
resolution and prevent this strike, if 
possible. The Board released its rec-
ommendations to resolve this dispute 
nearly a month ago, but a deal is still 
nowhere in sight. 
In recent weeks, a number of admin-
istration 
officials 
have 
joined 
the 
unions and freight companies at the 
negotiating table. The Secretaries of 
Labor, Transportation, and Agriculture 
have all tried to help resolve the im-
passe, but they have not moved the 
needle at all. 
I don’t know how much havoc is in 
store, but it is not looking good. Many 
shipments have already stopped out of 
fear that the operations will stop 
midjourney. I read that even commuter 
trains like Amtrak have already can-
celed some of their routes because they 
know what sort of impact this strike 
will have if no deal is reached by Fri-
day. 
Inflation has already sent prices to 
an untenable high. The supply chain 
breakdown is sure to send those prices 
even higher. 
Families 
can 
anticipate 
product 
shortages across the board from gro-
cery stores to car lots. Shoppers can 
expect packages that they have ordered 
to be delayed for days or even weeks on 
end. And drivers should expect to see 
more trucks on the highway to fill the 
gap when the railroad shuts down. 
This is just another example of the 
failure of the Biden administration to 
anticipate and to address the problems 
that the American people are facing. It 
seems there is a huge disconnect be-
tween what is happening here in Wash-
ington among our Democratic friends 
and the Biden administration and what 
I hear from my constituents back 
home. And I think that is true largely 
across the Nation; that the elites in 
Washington have become completely 
decoupled from the rest of the country. 
What that produces is special inter-
est legislation that pleases some con-
stituents: labor unions, climate activ-
ists, and open borders advocates. 
The Biden administration and our 
Democratic majority have used their 
power in Washington to spend trillions 
of dollars on things that the American 
people don’t want while compounding 
the problems that they are facing day 
in and day out: inflation, a recession, a 
paralyzing supply chain shutdown on 
the horizon, a spike in crime, and then, 
of course, an open border, which has al-
lowed enough illegal drugs to be im-
ported into the United States that it 
took 108,000 American lives last year. 
And 71,000 of those 108,000 lives were as 
a result of synthetic opioids like 
fentanyl. 
Synthetic opioids are raging like a 
brush fire across the entire country, 
and we are seeing, for example, at mid-
dle schools and high schools in places 
like Hays County, right outside of Aus-
tin, TX, where I live, that young peo-
ple, unbeknownst to themselves, ingest 
small amounts of this fentanyl and ul-
timately end up overdosing and dying 
from it. 
So there are huge challenges facing 
our country. We need to do our job. We 
need to work together. No one is sug-
gesting that we give up our principles. 
Republicans 
are 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats are Democrats for a rea-
son—because they view the role and 
the size of the government differently. 
Our Democratic colleagues seem to 
think that Washington and govern-
ment is the answer to every problem. 
Republicans and conservatives, on the 
other hand, tend to favor individual 
initiative and entrepreneurship and in-
vestment to create jobs and an oppor-
tunity for people to get jobs and pro-
vide for their family and pursue their 
dream. 
But there is plenty of overlap where 
we can agree, but we have to fight in-
flation. We have to deal with things 
like the paralyzing supply chain and 
the threat from a rail strike that ap-
pears now to be imminent. 
We have got to do more to support 
our men and women in uniform—the 
police—as they battle crime in our 
neighborhoods and our communities, 
which seems to have gone up exponen-
tially in recent years. 
And then, of course, there is the one 
big, gaping, open sore that our Demo-
cratic colleagues have ignored com-
pletely, and that is our open border. 
I mentioned the drugs, but in addi-
tion to the drugs, we have seen 2.3 mil-
lion migrants show up at the border 
just since President Biden became 
President because they know they are 
going to be able to get into the coun-
try. 
And they are probably going to be 
able to stay because the Biden adminis-
tration simply does not have any plan 
in place to decide asylum claims—who 
has legitimate claims and who does 
not—so they engage in a program of 
catch-and-release. With the litigation 
backlogs in our immigration courts, it 
is no surprise that when years go by 
and your ticket comes up and you are 
told to show up in immigration court, 
that people simply fade into the great 
American landscape and avoid detec-
tion. 
The only people benefiting from this, 
beyond the occasional migrant, are the 
drug cartels and the transnational 
criminal organizations that network 
people from around the world. 
I know of many people who aren’t 
from a border State like I am who 
think that these migrants are just 
from Mexico or Central America. But if 
you talk to the Border Patrol sector 
chiefs in Del Rio or the Rio Grande 
Valley, they will tell you they are de-
taining people from as many as 150 dif-
ferent countries. 
Now, surely, the majority are from 
Mexico and Central America, but it 
ought to cause us a lot of concern when 
somebody can get to our back door 
from another country and then falsely 
claim asylum only to be released into 
the interior of the United States and 
never heard from again. 
These are all fixable problems if we 
will work together, but so far, while 
the American people may have thought 
they elected Joe Biden, a moderate, 
they basically have seen BERNIE SAND-
ERS’ agenda. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

dent, have you ever gone out to eat at 
a restaurant with a group of people, 
but your order was cheaper than every-
one else’s? Maybe you weren’t as hun-
gry or the restaurant the group picked 
was more expensive than you could af-
ford so you were selective about what 
you ordered. Then, when the check 
comes, someone suggested the group 
split it evenly. 
Now, what is your immediate reac-
tion? You are upset, of course, because 
you ordered the salad not the filet 
mignon or you drank water, not the ex-
pensive bottle of wine. You ordered 
what you wanted, and they ordered 
what they wanted; you shouldn’t be on 
the hook for their cost. 
Sadly, this illustration is far too 
real, as last month, Joe Biden an-
nounced that he would cancel billions 
of dollars in student loans. 
Now, let’s be clear. He isn’t canceling 
student debt. No, he is transferring 
that debt to every American taxpayer. 
Now a construction worker in Florida 
is having to foot the bill for the loans 
of a Harvard grad, which they volun-
tarily accepted for an education they 
received. 
So here is what Democrats are trying 
to say to that construction worker: 
You didn’t go to college; Democrats 
don’t care. You will pay the debt of 
lawyers and doctors, and you will pay 
for those who want Ph.D.s in poetry. 
Talk about poetic injustice. You went 
to community college or a State school 
and worked to graduate debt-free. 
Tough luck. Joe Biden wants you to 
pay for the advanced degrees of the 
privileged few. Your tax dollars are 
now the money pot for other people’s 
student debt. 
Of course, Joe Biden’s plan doesn’t 
even begin to address the real reason 
for rising higher education costs. That 
is universities’ decades-long practice of 
unnecessarily raising tuition. 
As Governor of Florida, I addressed 
that problem and challenged our uni-
versities to keep education affordable. 
Look at the University of Florida. 
Undergraduate tuition and fees for this 
academic year are less than $6,500. It is 
the fifth best public university in the 
country. You will get a fantastic edu-
cation there. Meanwhile, at Harvard, 
tuition fees for an academic year cost 
more than $57,000. 
There are ways to make education af-
fordable, but the Democrats and elites 
aren’t interested in those solutions. 
That is why Joe Biden is engaging in 
this reckless move even though it 
doesn’t solve the real issue and even 
though he lacks the proper constitu-
tional authority. 
Everybody knows this. That is why, 
in July of last year, NANCY PELOSI her-
self denied that the President had such 
power. 
She said: 
The president can’t do it . . . That’s not 
even a discussion. 
Yet now the Department of Justice is en-
gaging in interpretive gymnastics to co-opt 
legislation that was passed to help our serv-
icemembers in the aftermath of 9/11. It is a 
desperate attempt to stretch a good law well 
beyond its intent so that Joe Biden can give 
handouts to his liberal voters and Harvard 
pals. 
Biden wants to spend money that 
Congress has not appropriated for a 
loan forgiveness that Congress has not 
authorized. It is illegal. It is unconsti-
tutional. It is a gross abuse of author-
ity, and I won’t stand for it. Congress 
must assert its authority here. We 
have the power of the purse, not the 
President. 
That is why I have introduced the 
Debt Cancellation Accountability Act. 
My bill would require the Department 
of Education to get an express appro-
priation from Congress before they 
could propose waiving, discharging, or 
reducing student loan debt to two or 
more borrowers in an amount greater 
than $1 million. If we want to transfer 
the debt of some and make everyone 
pay for it, then Congress has to make 
that decision. 
We should simply put it up for a vote. 
Of course, the Democrats here in the 
Senate won’t do that. Surely, they 
could have passed a bill by now if they 
had really wanted to, but they wanted 
Biden to do it alone. It is easy to see 
why. In just the past few weeks, we 
have heard families from across the 
country speaking out against Biden’s 
unfair and disastrous proposal. I am 
hearing about it from Floridians every 
day, and I know my colleagues are too. 
I would like to thank Senators BAR-
RASSO, LUMMIS, and BRAUN
for sup-
porting my Debt Cancellation Account-
ability Act and for choosing to stand 
with me against Biden’s overreach. 
Let’s pass this bill today to reverse 
Joe Biden’s unlawful decision and force 
Congress to decide this issue. 
Before I ask for unanimous consent, I 
would like to turn to my colleague 
Senator BRAUN from the great State of 
Indiana. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER). The Senator from Indi-
ana. 
Mr. BRAUN. I thank Senator SCOTT. 
Mr. President, President Biden’s stu-
dent loan debt transfer does not cancel 
or forgive anything. These debts will 
still be paid. It is not like they go 
away. 
What else does it say about the whole 
idea that, when you take on an obliga-
tion and you agree to it, you can just 
shirk it or get rid of it? There are 
many people across the country who 
would want to be in on that gambit as 
well. He has simply shifted the cost of 
repayment on to everyone, including to 
the 65 percent of American workers 
who chose not to get a college degree. 
What about the aspiring plumber or 
electrician 
who 
borrowed 
$20,000, 
$30,000, or $40,000 for his or her own 
business? There would be no end to it. 
We should focus on getting more 
value out of colleges rather than giving 
them another reason to hike prices. 
Sadly, the only place where that has 
been focused on is in my own home 
State, where Mitch Daniels, the ex- 
Governor of Indiana, froze tuition into 
10 years. That is getting more value 
out, and that is why their enrollment 
has gone way up. 
With a national debt of nearly $31 
trillion, we can’t continue to pile on 
more debt. When Senator SCOTT and I 
got here just a little over 31⁄2 years ago, 
we were $18 trillion in debt. We throw 
‘‘trillions’’ around now like we used to 
‘‘hundreds of billions,’’ and it is on the 
backs of our kids and grandkids every 
time we do it. 
Today, Federal Student Aid owns $1.6 
trillion in outstanding Federal assets— 
in other words, student loans. The loan 
program needs to be completely redone 
so that colleges will be motivated to 
lower costs. This is an excuse to do the 
opposite. 
Finally, President Biden’s actions 
are illegal in the first place. The Presi-
dent doesn’t have the authority to can-
cel all of this debt. I am hoping it gets 
taken to court, because what does it 
say, again, for future generations or 
anyone who makes a commitment to 
take on debt who can shirk it with the 
stroke of a pen? 
Even Speaker PELOSI agreed on this 
point, saying she didn’t think it was 
legal. Yet it doesn’t make any dif-
ference in this day and age as we plow 
forward. 
This is why the Debt Cancellation 
Accountability Act requires the De-
partment of Education to get express 
appropriation from Congress to pay for 
any Federal student loan the Depart-
ment proposes to waive, discharge, or 
reduce. 
I yield the floor to Senator SCOTT. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I am so thank-
ful for Senator BRAUN’s support on this 
bill and for all of the work he has done 
to raise awareness about Biden’s reck-
less spending agenda and to stand for 
fiscal sanity. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 4483 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediate consideration; further, that 
the bill be considered read a third time 
and passed and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, this is a shame-
ful attempt by the Republicans to keep 
working 
Americans 
buried 
under 
mountains of student debt.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4599 
September 14, 2022 
President Biden’s decision to cancel 
up to $20,000 of Federal student debt for 
as many as 43 million Americans with 
incomes under $125,000 a year is a his-
toric step to delivering life-changing 
relief to working families and to help-
ing rebuild America’s middle class. 
Senator SCOTT’s bill is just one of the 
Republicans’ desperate efforts to block 
cancelation for millions of Americans. 
Now, the Republicans are happy to pass 
out tax breaks and regulatory loop-
holes for billionaires and giant cor-
porations, but they are fighting tooth 
and nail to keep working families from 
getting a penny of relief. 
Evidently, Senator SCOTT
believes 
that $2 trillion in Republican tax cuts 
that were not paid for is fine so long as 
those tax cuts are aimed mostly at mil-
lionaires, billionaires, and giant cor-
porations. But a program that costs a 
fraction as much and for which 90 per-
cent of its benefits go to people earning 
less than $75,000 a year is now somehow 
a moral outrage. 
Today, he claims to worry about 
those taxpayers who he says will shoul-
der 
student 
loan 
cancelation, 
but 
where was Senator SCOTT, or then-Gov-
ernor Scott, when Donald Trump and 
the congressional Republicans handed 
out $2 trillion in tax breaks to billion-
aires and giant corporations, not a 
penny of which was paid for? Where 
was he then? 
Well, he endorsed the Trump admin-
istration’s plan to cut taxes for cor-
porations, and he celebrated those tax 
breaks for the richest among us. He 
wasn’t worried about how taxpayers 
would pay that off—not a word about 
the fairness for all of the people who 
would bear that burden, so long as the 
benefits went mostly to the rich and 
powerful. 
Senator SCOTT has basically laid it 
all out there for America to see, and 
that difference—helping billionaires or 
helping working families—pretty much 
sums up Republican and Democratic 
differences across the board. If we are 
cutting a break for the rich and the 
powerful, the Republicans are on board. 
If we are trying to help out working 
people, congressional Republicans take 
to their fainting couches and claim to 
be so worried about the national debt. 
Student loan cancelation is very pop-
ular in America, including with a ma-
jority of people who have no student 
loan debt. That is because there is 
scarcely a working person anywhere in 
America today who does not know 
someone who is choking on student 
loan debt. Yet, evidently, the Repub-
licans in Congress live in bubbles that 
prevent them from meeting any of the 
millions of people out there who have 
busted their tails, who have worked 
multiple jobs, who have made their 
payments, and who still watch their 
debt loads continue to climb. 
So let me just set the record straight 
here. I want to repeat an earlier point. 
Nearly 90 percent of relief dollars from 
President Biden’s cancelation will go 
to Americans earning less than $75,000 
a year, and none—none—of the help 
goes to people making more than 
$125,000 a year. 
Now, 
actually, 
those 
numbers 
shouldn’t be shocking. Think about 
who owns student loan debt. Senator 
SCOTT talked about Harvard multiple 
times in his speech, but it is not the 
wealthy people who go to Ivy League 
schools who end up with the student 
loan debt. It is middle- and working- 
class Americans who were born into 
families who couldn’t afford to pay 
out-of-pocket. In fact, 99.7 percent of 
borrowers did not attend an Ivy League 
school. So that would mean—what?— 
three-tenths of 1 percent of people who 
went to Ivy League schools borrowed 
money. 
By comparison—I just looked it up 
while the Senator was speaking—at the 
University of Florida, 15 percent have 
to borrow in order to make it through 
to graduation. At Florida State, 26 per-
cent—that is one in every four people 
at Florida State—has to take out 
money in order to be in college. At 
Florida A&M, the numbers are even 
higher: 68 percent. More than two- 
thirds of the people who are in school 
have to take out money in order to 
make it through college. This is true 
across the country. At State schools, 
about half of all students have to bor-
row to make it through. At historically 
Black colleges and universities, the 
number is about 90 percent. 
So let’s be really clear about who ex-
actly congressional Republicans are 
trying to take relief away from. It is 
not Ivy Leaguer doctors and lawyers. 
Who are the people the Senate Repub-
licans say aren’t worthy of the kind of 
help that billionaires and giant cor-
porations could get in their big tax 
package? Who do Senate Republicans 
think should be squeezed harder? Who 
do Senate Republicans say should sim-
ply be left behind? 
Well, the Senate Republicans want to 
leave behind the 42 percent of bor-
rowers who do not even have a 4-year 
college diploma. These are folks who 
took out money—loans—in order to be-
come a nurse’s aide, to become a me-
chanic, to go to beauty school, to get a 
commercial driver’s license to drive a 
truck, and, too often, the wages that 
they were promised never materialized. 
Senate Republicans say: Let them 
struggle. Leave them behind. 
Who gets the most help under Presi-
dent 
Biden’s 
cancelation? 
Senator 
SCOTT said this is all about doctors and 
lawyers. Let’s take a look at that. 
The share of student loan borrowers 
who earned a cosmetology certificate 
is about double the share of borrowers 
who got professional degrees in law and 
medicine combined. 
Senate Republicans say: Let those 
cosmetology certificate holders strug-
gle. Leave them behind. 
Similarly, there are more student 
loan borrowers who took out debt to 
earn a certificate for driving trucks 
and working on the railroad than those 
who did so to become dentists and op-
tometrists. 
Senate Republicans say: Let those 
truckdrivers 
and 
railroad 
workers 
struggle. Leave them behind. 
It is not just the people who have 2- 
year degrees or certificates who get 
help 
under 
President 
Biden’s 
cancelation. It is the people who don’t 
have any degree at all. These are peo-
ple who did everything our country 
asked them to do by graduating from 
high school and advancing their edu-
cations, but life happened: They got 
pregnant or they had to take care of a 
sick family member, and they had to 
leave before finishing their degree. 
Senate Republicans say: Let them 
struggle. Leave them behind. 
Who gets help? It is women, who hold 
nearly two-thirds of all outstanding 
student loan debt. Black women, in 
particular, shoulder a disproportionate 
amount of the student loan debt bur-
den—Black women, who hold more debt 
than any other group. 
Senate Republicans say: Let them 
struggle. Leave them behind. 
Who gets help? It is Black Ameri-
cans, who borrow more money to go to 
college, borrow more money in college, 
and have a harder time paying it off 
after college. They are the ones who 
will see their debt eliminated under 
President Biden’s cancelation plan. 
Senate Republicans say: Let them 
struggle. Leave them behind. 
Who gets help? It is the 50 percent of 
Latino borrowers with debt who will 
see their student loan debt completely 
eliminated. Senate Republicans say let 
them struggle. Leave them behind. 
Who gets help? It is the millions of 
people who couldn’t save for retire-
ment, or buy their first home, or start 
a family because of student debt. Sen-
ate Republicans say let them struggle. 
Leave them behind. 
We are living in a moment when the 
President of the United States has 
reached out, literally, to tens of mil-
lions of families and said: I am putting 
government on your side. But the con-
gressional Republicans are determined 
to make this country work even better 
for the rich and the powerful. That is 
why they are trying to pass the bill 
that Senator SCOTT has advanced. 
These Republicans are all for giving 
handouts to giant corporations and bil-
lionaires. 
But 
the 
minute—the 
minute—that our country creates a lit-
tle breathing room for the millions of 
hard-working people whose biggest sin 
is they tried to get an education and 
they grew up in a family that just 
couldn’t afford to pay for it, those Sen-
ate Republicans are right here on this 
Senate floor trying to undo it. 
I want to take a minute and just look 
at the bigger picture to see how we got 
here. 
We have a student debt crisis because 
our government stopped investing in 
higher education and began shifting 
the costs of college onto working fami-
lies. 
I went to a great public university 
that costs $50 a semester—a price I 
could 
pay 
for 
on 
a

teacher, a law professor, and a U.S. 
Senator 
because 
higher 
education 
opened a million doors for a kid like 
me. But that opportunity no longer ex-
ists in America. 
Today, college costs thousands, even 
tens of thousands, of dollars. And in-
stead of investing taxpayer dollars to 
help bring down those costs, the State 
governments reduced their financial 
support, and the Federal Government 
told everyone to borrow the money 
they needed to cover the rising costs of 
going to school. That has left millions 
of Americans drowning in student loan 
debt. 
What is worse, families have had to 
navigate a broken student loan system 
riddled with bad actors who are trying 
to take advantage of and profit off 
keeping them in debt. 
During 
the 
Trump 
years, 
Betsy 
DeVos, the Secretary of Education, 
threw in with the for-profit schools. 
And when students who had been 
cheated asked for some help, she 
turned her back. 
I have long pushed for more account-
ability and more oversight to bring 
down the cost of college and to make 
higher education and training pro-
grams more accessible. I have a plan 
for that. In fact, I have more than one 
plan for that, and I welcome any Re-
publican to join me in helping make 
any of these options reality. 
But cancellation is the first step to 
fixing a broken student loan system 
and to delivering relief to families who 
have been trapped in it for far too long. 
One final point: The President’s plan 
to cancel student debt will make a 
huge difference for tens of millions of 
Americans in their day-to-day lives. 
But it will do so much more. Debt can-
cellation is about strengthening our 
whole economy. Better educated work-
ers make us a wealthier nation and one 
with more opportunity, not just for 
those at the top but more opportunity 
for everyone. 
Just consider one example. Following 
World War II, a grateful nation said to 
returning GIs that taxpayers would 
pick up the cost of college and tech-
nical training. More than 2 million vet-
erans went to college or graduate 
school and nearly 6 million used this 
opportunity to pursue vocational train-
ing to become construction workers, 
electricians, mechanics, and other ca-
reers. Together, these men—and they 
were nearly all men—built America’s 
middle class. 
Taxpayer investments in post-high 
school education meant that millions 
of people were better educated, and 
they helped fuel an economic boom 
that lasted for decades and lifted this 
entire Nation. And it was a bargain. 
Every dollar that was spent on edu-
cating our veterans generated $7 to 
taxpayers. That is not even counting 
for the significant boost to produc-
tivity from a more educated popu-
lation. Just think about that: a 7-to-1 
payoff for investing in higher edu-
cation for all our people. 
President Biden saw something that 
he could do to help tens of millions of 
Americans struggling under the weight 
of student debt and invest in the future 
of our economy, so he did it. Debt can-
cellation was the right thing to do. 
That is why the majority of Ameri-
cans—with or without loans—support 
cancellation. 
I am celebrating because cancella-
tion will provide life-changing relief 
for working families across this coun-
try. That is why I object to the Senate 
Republican’s 
shameless 
attempt 
to 
deny people the relief they need. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. So the plan that the 
Democrats are going to give you, not 
only on this, was put out clearly in 
President Biden’s blueprint for our 
country to put us $45 trillion in debt in 
10 years, where we will be paying as 
much on interest as we do on discre-
tionary spending domestically or the 
military budget. That is no business 
plan. 
How do you think they are going to 
pay for the debt forgiveness? They are 
going to borrow the money to do it, to 
backfill to pay the people who are owed 
the money. 
One other point of clarification. 
When you had a practical bill—the Tax 
Cuts and Jobs Act, which was done be-
fore Senator SCOTT and I got here—it 
was a plan to grow economic activity, 
a way to pay for it. Had COVID not 
come along, the CBO was ready to say 
that it was paying for itself because we 
were growing the economy at 3 per-
cent. And the $150 billion per year over 
10 years, which is chump change now 
compared to the $3 trillion the Demo-
crats have put us in debt over the last 
year and a half, was growing the econ-
omy with zero inflation, raising wages 
in the toughest spots for those wage 
earners. We have always tried to do it 
without borrowing it from our kids and 
our grandkids. 
I yield back the floor to Senator 
SCOTT. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
so let’s remember what we are talking 
about here. We are not canceling debt; 
we are transferring debt. We are trans-
ferring the debt because this obligation 
doesn’t go away. Somebody still owes 
this money. 
What we are saying is, people who de-
cided—they made the choice—to go to 
college or go to some higher education, 
they are not going to have to pay their 
debt. And people who didn’t and al-
ready paid off their debt, they are 
going to pay for it. 
My colleague from Massachusetts 
never acknowledged the example. We 
all remember when we went out to din-
ner and we didn’t spend the most 
money and how somebody suggested 
that, oh, let’s just share it. So we paid 
for the expensive wine, and we paid for 
the expensive meal. That is not fair. 
When you talk to Americans around 
the country, and they say: Would you 
like to forgive all the debt? Absolutely. 
Free is great. 
But when you say: You are going to 
pay for it, they say: Absolutely not. 
Why would I pay off the debt for some-
body else? 
Let’s remember just what my bill 
does. It doesn’t say we can’t forgive 
student loans; it says that Congress 
ought to decide if we do it. This is 
going to cost up to $1 trillion. 
I don’t think we ought to, so-called, 
transfer this debt, but my bill will at 
least give us a chance to have a debate 
on it. But that is not what my col-
league wants to do. 
I hope my colleague understands that 
her objection is absolutely a slap in the 
face to all those workers in Massachu-
setts and around the country who 
didn’t go to college: construction work-
ers, small business owners, chefs, flight 
attendants, firefighters, landscapers, 
and so many other groups of people 
who have made the decision not to pur-
sue a higher education for whatever 
reason. 
There are many others who worked 
hard to get scholarships or those who 
worked part time to afford college or 
plenty others who took the time to pay 
off their loans. I am going to stand 
with those people, working-class peo-
ple—people who are responsible, hard- 
working Americans who absolutely are 
willing to pay off their obligations. 
I think about people like my dad. My 
dad had a sixth grade education. He 
was a truckdriver. He worked his tail 
off. I can’t imagine what he would 
think about working hard every day, 
then being forced to pay for some other 
person’s degree as a doctor or a lawyer. 
He would be beside himself. He would 
think it was so unfair. 
It is not how the real world works. It 
is a Democrat fantasyland that Joe 
Biden is trying to turn into reality. 
People used to take pride in paying 
off their debts and working hard to see 
their 
commitments 
come 
through. 
Democrats want to destroy that and 
destroy ideas of fiscal responsibility. 
They want to forget that we are $30 
trillion in debt. They want to forget 
that we still have record-high inflation 
as a result of wasteful spending. 
My colleague wants to pretend that 
we are in this fantasyland because ob-
jecting to my bill is an endorsement of 
Biden’s reckless plan and his unconsti-
tutional debt transfer, from the over-
achiever, to the Harvard grad, to the 
working class. 
As Members of Congress, we should 
be interested in checks and balances 
and the separation of powers. We 
should guard the powers of the Con-
stitution that is especially reserved for 
the legislative branch. Spending a tril-
lion dollars with no congressional over-
sight is wrong. That is not exactly how 
our Constitution was set up. This 
shameless decision to block my bill is 
just another example of how far Senate 
Democrats will go to appease the rad-
ical left.

September 14, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. So I am still waiting 
for an answer to the question: Where 
were these Republicans who were talk-
ing about fiscal responsibility and 
what is fair in terms of transferring 
costs, when it was the billionaires and 
the giant corporations who were get-
ting a $2 trillion tax break? 
Let us remember—because I was here 
when that happened—even the conserv-
ative economists and think tanks were 
saying this is going to go on the debt 
balance because it is not paid for. 
No. At that moment, they were will-
ing to say: But it is going to produce 
all kinds of wonderful benefits—which, 
of course, did not come to pass. 
What about the example I gave, the 
example about the investment that we 
made as a country in our returning 
veterans; the fact that we invested so 2 
million of them could get college diplo-
mas, so that millions more could get 
technical degrees? What about the fact 
that the numbers show American tax-
payers got a return on that investment 
of 7 to 1? This really is about who we 
invest in. 
It seems that what Senator SCOTT is 
saying is people shouldn’t go to school. 
If you are in a family that you can’t 
guarantee that you are going to have 
some assets to back you up, if you ever 
have to think about the fact that you 
might get sick, you might fall down, 
you might get hurt, and you might not 
be able to finish, or you might not be 
able to turn that degree into a high- 
paying job, or you might graduate at a 
moment when the economy is in a 
slump, what Senator SCOTT seems to be 
saying is: Don’t order off that menu. 
Don’t go to school. Don’t try to get a 
post-high school certificate in cosme-
tology. Don’t try to get a certificate 
for truckdriving school. Don’t try to 
get a 2-year diploma. Don’t try to get a 
4-year diploma. That is not going to 
make America a better or richer coun-
try. That is not going to be an America 
that is going to open opportunities. 
The next time Senator SCOTT or any 
other Republican talks to me about 
fair, I would ask them to explain to me 
what is fair that the daughter of a jan-
itor a half a century ago could go to a 
good 4-year college on $50 a semester? 
Why? Because American taxpayer in-
vested in those public colleges and uni-
versities. And today that opportunity 
is not there for a single one of our kids. 
When you want to talk about who 
has college debt, instead of talking 
about the three-tenths of 1 percent of 
Ivy League grads who have college 
debt, look at the 68 percent of Florida 
A&M grads who have college debt. That 
is shameful. We need to be an America 
that is about creating more opportuni-
ties, not closing them off for tens of 
millions of people. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
first off, my colleague never addressed 
the issue that this is a transfer of obli-
gation. I mean, you can have a con-
versation about what we should have 
done with regard to tax cuts in the 
past, but this is a transfer of obliga-
tion. This is a transfer of obligation of 
people who decided to go to school. 
We should do everything we can to 
help people, but we are not addressing 
the problem here. I addressed it when I 
was Governor. When I became Gov-
ernor in January of 2011, tuition in 
Florida was going up 15 percent a year, 
plus inflation. I stopped it. We didn’t 
see tuition increase while I was Gov-
ernor, and we became the No. 1 higher 
education system in the country ac-
cording to U.S. News & World Report. 
We solved the problem of the cost of 
higher education to make sure people 
could afford education. We did it be-
cause we invested, we kept tuition low, 
and we paid our universities based on 
three things: do you get a degree, how 
much money you make, and what does 
it cost to get a degree. So, guess what, 
all of our universities became more ef-
ficient and more accountable. 
That is how you fix the problem. This 
does not fix the problem. This does 
nothing to reduce tuition. This does 
nothing to hold our universities ac-
countable. This does nothing to stop 
our universities from raising tuition. 
This does nothing to require our uni-
versities to make sure our kids get a 
job. This does nothing to make sure 
our kids get good-paying jobs. 
So I am very disappointed in my col-
league in that she would still not ad-
dress the issue that that is a complete 
transfer of obligation from some people 
who decided to go get a higher edu-
cation to people who decided not to. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, would 
the Senator yield for a question? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would 
the Senator yield for a question? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. I yield the 
floor. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, I want 
to ask the Senator if he believes that 
the 68 percent of students at Florida 
A&M University who have student loan 
debt should never have gone to college 
because it turns out their families 
couldn’t afford to pay for college in 
Florida. 
Should they just never have tried? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Are you fin-
ished? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Absolutely. I 
did everything I could to make sure all 
of our students had the opportunity to 
go to school. We made sure that they 
could afford to go to school. 
What I have said in my bill today is 
this ought to be done by Congress. And 
let’s don’t just do some blanket trans-
fer of obligations here. Congress should 
be doing this. This is going to cost us 
up to $1 trillion, and we are going to 
have people like my dad, if he was still 
alive—a truckdriver with a sixth-grade 
education—pay for some Ivy League 
kid to go to school, and that is wrong. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, can I 
ask for a clarification of that answer? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. So, among the 68 per-
cent of Florida A&M students who have 
student loan debt—I believe I heard the 
Senator say he made it possible for 
them to afford college, and I am won-
dering if he could explain how they 
could have afforded college without 
taking on that whole student loan 
debt. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I am not suggesting you shouldn’t bor-
row money, but what I am suggesting 
is, if you do borrow money, you made 
that decision, all right? You shouldn’t 
transfer it to somebody like my dad, 
who 
had 
a 
sixth-grade 
education, 
couldn’t afford to go to school, didn’t 
go to school. There shouldn’t be a 
transfer to make sure they pay off your 
debt. That is a decision you make. You 
should pay it off. 
Now, if you have an issue because 
you can’t pay it, let’s deal with that 
issue. That is not what this does. This 
says, whatever your issues, Joe Biden 
says, by himself, without any act of 
Congress—he gets to make a decision 
by himself: Poof, your debt goes away; 
somebody else picks it up. That is not 
right. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am 
really delighted that my colleague 
from Florida is suddenly concerned 
about transfers of wealth—I really 
am—because, as he may or may not 
know, over the last 30 years, there has 
been a massive transfer of wealth. The 
problem is, it has gone in the wrong di-
rection. 
We are talking about the shrinking 
of the middle class. We are talking 
about trillions of dollars going to the 
top 1 percent. And we are ending up in 
a situation today where you have bil-
lionaires and you have large corpora-
tions that don’t pay a nickel in Federal 
taxes. 
I always find it interesting that 
whenever Congress does something— 
ever so rarely—that benefits working 
people and low-income people, there is 
an uproar: Oh my God, you are helping 
young people and working people; you 
are helping poor people. What a ter-
rible thing to do. 
But there is massive silence when 
you give gigantic tax breaks to the 1 
percent or large corporations that are 
now doing phenomenally well. 
So my colleague from Florida is in-
terested in the transfer of wealth? 
Let’s work together. Let’s make sure 
that the working class in this coun-
try—not just the billionaires—get a 
fair shake. Let’s help young people. 
Let’s start canceling the student debt 
that we should have done years ago.

S4602 
September 14, 2022 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
well, first off, let me make sure my 
colleague from Vermont knows my 
background. I actually grew up in pub-
lic housing, born to a single mom. I do 
care about people, making sure you can 
get an education. That is why I did ex-
actly what I did in Florida. I made sure 
people had the opportunity to get 
ahead. 
The 4 years before I became Governor 
of Florida, the State lost 832,000 jobs. 
By cutting taxes and reducing the reg-
ulations and streamlining things, we 
added 1.7 million jobs so people all over 
my State could get a job. That is how 
people get ahead. You don’t get ahead 
by just somebody transferring obliga-
tions from one person to somebody 
else. That improves a few people’s 
lives, but that is completely unfair. 
That is not how this country was set 
up, that some people are going to pay 
for somebody else’s obligation that 
they decided to pick up, and that is all 
I am talking about. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, you 
know, I really do think about this 
transfer question, and I find myself 
asking: Who paid for Jeff Bezos’s 
yacht? Is it the taxpayers who said: 
Now, 
we—America’s 
middle 
class, 
America’s working class—are actually 
going to have to pick up the slack. And 
they will be the ones who have to pay 
to keep the military. They are the ones 
who will have to pay for roads and 
bridges. They are the ones who will pay 
for investment in science. But the bil-
lionaires can get richer and richer and 
richer and pay little or nothing in 
taxes. That is a giant transfer, and yet 
none of our Republican colleagues 
seem interested in talking about that 
transfer and just putting a stop to the 
outflow from hard-working, middle- 
class families over to the billionaires 
and the giant corporations. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I think who paid for Jeff Bezos’s yacht 
is all the people who bought packages 
from Amazon. And by the way, if you 
do get one that says ‘‘Made in China,’’ 
I hope everybody will send it back. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—- S.J. RES. 61 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, in a few 
minutes, I am going to ask unanimous 
consent for the passage of the bill. In 
the interim, I would like to yield some 
time 
to 
my 
good 
friend 
Senator 
WICKER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I seek 
recognition to speak on the same mat-
ter that Senator BURR has raised and 
will raise on the unanimous consent re-
quest. 
Think of the economy right now, Mr. 
President. Inflation is at 8.3 percent or 
higher, our GDP is shrinking, and sup-
ply chains have not recovered from the 
pandemic. The last thing we need is a 
shutdown of this Nation’s rail service, 
both passenger and freight. Yet that is 
what we are facing in less than a day 
and a half from this moment: a massive 
rail strike that will virtually shut 
down our economy. 
Now, this didn’t have to happen, but 
I will tell you, it has been going on 
since 2019. So we are in our third year 
of this matter. There has been negotia-
tion among the rails, some 37 compa-
nies—including 7 major freight car-
riers—and 12 unions. They reached an 
impasse. So, pursuant to statute, the 
President of the United States, Presi-
dent Joe Biden, appointed a PEB, a 
Presidential Emergency Board, to help 
resolve this issue. They brought the 
parties together and have worked with 
the suggestions from both sides—both 
labor and management—and come up 
with their recommendation, which the 
President of the United States has en-
dorsed in full. 
We are now at the point where we are 
asking both labor and management to 
agree to this recommendation of the 
PEB. One hundred percent of manage-
ment has agreed to this recommenda-
tion of the Biden-appointed Presi-
dential Emergency Board. Of the 12 
unions, 8 of the unions have agreed. So 
we have an overwhelming majority of 
the unions agreeing to this and 100 per-
cent of management agreeing to it, but 
under the law that Congress, in its wis-
dom, passed years and years ago, we 
have to have 100 percent of the 12 
unions, and there are 4 holdouts at this 
point. 
Pursuant to the statute, when we get 
to a situation like this, Congress can 
step in, and that is what my friend is 
going to ask us to do in just a few min-
utes. 
Congress 
can 
pass 
the 
rec-
ommendation of the PEB in full. The 
Senate can pass it, send it over to the 
House, send it to the President, who 
has endorsed the recommendation in 
full, and we can avoid this strike. And 
that is what we ought to be doing. 
So I want to commend my friend 
from North Carolina for his leadership 
in this case. If the trains stop running, 
our economy grinds to a halt. And that 
is the very reason this law is in place, 
and it is the very reason why it is in-
cumbent on us as Senators and Rep-
resentatives to pass a resolution imple-
menting the PEB. 
I yield to my friend. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank my 
colleague from Mississippi. 
There are going to be some who say 
this is unprecedented by the Congress. 
In fact, under the Railway Labor Act, 
Congress is allowed to intervene. In 
fact, Congress has intervened 18 times 
in 
the 
past, 
imposing 
PEB 
rec-
ommendations in whole or in part 4 
times. 
If we don’t do it, if we do not force 
this issue, at 12:01 tomorrow night, the 
railroads will shut down, and the eco-
nomic impact on the American people 
is $2 billion a day—$2 billion. 
The Senator from Mississippi and I 
have introduced a bill that will adopt 
the Biden administration recommenda-
tions—recommendations that include a 
24-percent increase in pay, paid retro-
actively to 2020; annual bonuses of 
$1,000; and additional paid leave. This 
is what has been negotiated by the 
PEB board, but, as Senator WICKER 
said, there are holdouts from a stand-
point of some of the major unions even 
though eight have agreed to it. 
Now, as I said, Congress has taken 
this action 18 times to intervene in 12 
different rail disputes. It spans back to 
1982, and the latest was in 1991. So I 
dare say there are only a few that are 
in this body who were here when that 
happened. 
Now, Senator SANDERS
is on the 
floor, and I know he is going to object. 
I know he is going to object because I 
read his tweet this week. It said this: 
Congress shouldn’t stand in the way of 
railroad workers going on strike. The rail 
companies have avoided bargaining, abused 
their workers, and allied with the same 
forces who killed the Biden agenda in 2021. 
Now they want Congress to support their 
greed. Don’t. 
It sounds similar to the argument he 
was just making to Senator SCOTT 
about student loans. It sounds very 
similar to every argument he uses. It is 
that there is this thing in America 
where nobody is speaking up for some-
thing. 
Listen, this is the President’s bipar-
tisan emergency Board that he set up 
that came back with a recommenda-
tion to the Biden administration and 
said: Here is the solution to this. It 
should be adopted. 
This is really weird that Senator 
WICKER and I were on the floor intro-
ducing legislation that supports the 
President’s position and supports the 
position of the Presidential Emergency 
Board. 
Now, here is the key thing. This is 
the takeaway. We don’t have to be 
here. Senator SCHUMER at any point 
can place this legislation on the floor. 
Clearly, Senator SANDERS would object 
then. But let me make a promise. If 
Senator SCHUMER needs votes, I can de-
liver 48 Republican votes to implement 
the PEB recommendation and the 
Biden-endorsed position. 
Let me say that again because I want 
to make sure Senator SCHUMER’s staff 
understands. This is about how you get 
to 60. I don’t want to give a 101 of the 
U.S. Senate, but 60 votes, as the Presi-
dent knows, is required. I am offering 
him 48. He only needs to get 12 on his 
side to have 60 votes, take this up, pass 
it, to have this over with. And there is 
no interruption. 
Not only is it $2 billion a day in eco-
nomic impact; this is 160,000 trainloads 
of agricultural product at a time of 
harvest to cross this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4603 
September 14, 2022 
There are some who say: Well, this 
isn’t going to affect me. They haul 
coal. They haul gas. They haul petro-
leum. They haul gases like helium that 
are required for manufacturing busi-
nesses. They haul auto parts, which 
means you are going to see auto assem-
bly plants that shut down not because 
of China but because we let the rail-
road workers go on strike and did not 
support the President’s position. 
This is not political. This is Repub-
licans supporting the President’s posi-
tion and only asking 12 Democrats to 
support this action. 
I ask my colleagues: Drop this con-
cern that you are representing one side 
or the other. Ask yourself what is best 
for America. 
We just got a report that inflation is 
8.3—8.3; food up 7; housing up 6; gaso-
line was down, and I think everybody 
expected inflation numbers to go way 
down. So 8.3 percent—wages aren’t 
keeping up with that. 
Every American family is losing 
money every month. And now you are 
going to tell them you are going to be 
paying more because food is going to be 
scarce. Commodities are going to be 
scarce. Some things aren’t going to be 
delivered. 
If we thought that the port chaos 
that we saw last year was bad, we are 
going to see a complete shutdown of 
rail, and we are just a matter of 
months away from Christmas, when 
most retailers are counting on that 
product to come in. 
There are ports like Seattle and L.A., 
what are they going to do with the con-
tainers? You talk about ships staying 
out at ocean. Amtrak canceled their 
east-west rail coverage today going for-
ward. Carriers have already stopped 
hauling hazardous waste because they 
didn’t want to get halfway down a line 
and not be able to secure the hazardous 
waste. 
We are at a real tipping point on this. 
And this can all be solved by either no 
objection to the unanimous consent re-
quest or by Senator SCHUMER bringing 
this to the floor, knowing that he has 
48 Republicans, and he only needs to 
produce 12 to get to 60. This is a really 
easy thing. It is an easy lift. 
Well, my hope is that we will take 
one of the two paths. But do under-
stand that in less than 48 hours, at 
12:01 Friday morning, the likelihood is 
that without action by Congress, there 
will be a strike, and rail traffic will 
stop. Period, end of sentence. 
At this time, Mr. President, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S.J. Res. 61 and the Senate proceed to 
its immediate consideration; further, 
that the joint resolution be considered 
read a third time and passed and that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. And I will object. Let 
me thank Senator BURR for actually 
reading my tweets. Much appreciated. 
Just a correction of the record. I 
think Senator WICKER mentioned be-
fore that a number of unions had ap-
proved this agreement. As I think ev-
erybody knows, there cannot be an ap-
proval of a union agreement unless the 
workers themselves vote on it. They 
have not voted on it. So, in fact, there 
has been no approval by any union of 
the agreement. But before I go to the 
rail situation, I did want to say a few 
words and put this issue into a broader 
context, and then I will get to the rail 
situation. 
As I think most Americans know, 
today we have more income and wealth 
inequality than at any time in the his-
tory of our country. People on top are 
doing phenomenally well while work-
ing people are struggling to keep their 
heads above water. 
During the pandemic, while essential 
workers, like those employed at the 
railroads—while these people put their 
lives on the line and died by the thou-
sands, the billionaire class—the people 
on top—saw a $2 trillion increase in 
their wealth. Workers died by the tens 
of thousands. People on top became 
much richer. 
Further, as healthcare costs soar, we 
have over 70 million Americans who 
are either uninsured or underinsured, 
and, in addition, the United States re-
mains the only major country on Earth 
not to guarantee paid family and med-
ical leave. That is the broad issue that 
we have got to look at as we look at 
the situation in the rail industry. 
As I understand it, it is not accurate 
to say that the President of the United 
States has agreed to what the PEB has 
come up with. They have come up with 
a proposal. But right now, as we speak, 
Labor Secretary Marty Walsh is cur-
rently meeting with the rail union’s 
end management in trying to forge an 
agreement. And I happen to wish them 
well. And I hope that those meetings 
lead to an agreement that is fair and 
that is just. 
But let us make no mistake about 
what is happening in the rail industry 
right now—and I did not hear one word 
of that from my Republican col-
leagues—and that is that the rail in-
dustry has seen huge profits in recent 
years and last year alone made a rec-
ordbreaking $20 billion in profit. Last 
year, the rail industry made $20 billion 
in profit. 
And let me also mention that the 
CEOs of many of these rail companies 
are enjoying huge compensation pack-
ages. For example, last year, the CEO 
of CSX made over 20 million in total 
compensation while the CEOs of Union 
Pacific and Norfolk Southern made 
over $14 million each in total com-
pensation. 
In other words, what is happening in 
the rail industry is what is happening 
all over this country. Corporate profits 
are soaring, and CEOs are making in-
credibly large compensation packages. 
I would also add that the parent com-
pany of BNSF—one of the largest 
freight rail companies in America—is 
Berkshire Hathaway, owned by Warren 
Buffett. Mr. Buffett is the fourth 
wealthiest man in America, worth 
nearly $100 billion. During the pan-
demic, as railworkers risked their lives 
to keep the economy going, Mr. Buffett 
became $33 billion richer. 
In the midst of all of those profit in-
creases for the industry, in the midst 
of huge compensation packages for the 
CEOs of the industry, in the midst of 
increased wealth for those who own 
these companies, what is going on for 
the workers? I think that is a fair ques-
tion to ask, if we are in the midst of 
negotiations. What is going on for the 
workers? How are they doing? 
It turns out that the key issue in the 
current negotiations is not about sala-
ries. Apparently, there is an agreement 
on that. The key issue that is being 
contested is about the working condi-
tions in the industry which are abso-
lutely unacceptable and are almost be-
yond belief. 
Right now, if you work in the freight 
rail industry—one of the most grueling 
and dangerous jobs in America—you 
are entitled to a grand total of zero 
sick days. 
In case you missed it, let me repeat 
it: You are entitled to zero sick days. 
What that means is that if you as a 
worker get sick, if your child gets sick, 
if your spouse gets sick and you need 
to take time off of work, not only will 
you not get paid, you actually could 
get fired. And that is precisely what is 
happening today in the rail industry. 
How crazy is that? 
Let me remind you of what you un-
doubtedly know, that hundreds of 
Americans are still dying every day 
from COVID and tens of thousands are 
being hospitalized as a result of this 
deadly virus. What the freight rail in-
dustry is saying to its workers is this: 
It doesn’t matter if you have COVID. It 
doesn’t matter if you are lying in a 
hospital bed because of a medical emer-
gency. It doesn’t matter if your wife 
just gave birth to your child. It doesn’t 
matter. If you do not come into work, 
no matter what the reason, we in the 
industry, we the bosses, have the right 
to fire you. 
Really? Do these conditions really 
exist in the United States of America, 
the wealthiest country on Earth in the 
year 2022? 
I do wonder if the CEO of the railroad 
or other top executives at that rail-
road—I wonder if they would get fired 
if they got sick or if they had a med-
ical emergency in their families. I 
doubt very much that they would get 
fired. 
Further, I should add, that quite sen-
sibly the Federal Government guaran-
tees 12 weeks of paid family and med-
ical leave to its workers. That is what 
we do as a Federal Government. So if 
you are an employee at the Depart-
ment of Transportation in the United

States, sitting behind a desk, you are, 
appropriately—I believe in this very 
much—guaranteed 12 weeks of paid 
family and medical leave. That is if 
you work at the Department of Trans-
portation. But if you are an engineer 
running a train with tons of freight be-
hind you—a very dangerous job—you 
get zero sick leave. 
Now, that may make sense to some-
body, but it doesn’t make sense to me. 
As a result of this reactionary policy of 
denying workers sick time, rail con-
ductors, engineers, and other rail em-
ployees are coming into work sick and 
exhausted, which is a danger not only 
to themselves but to their coworkers 
and everyone else who is around them. 
As part of the contract negotiations, 
the railworkers are asking for 15 paid 
sick days. This is not a radical idea. We 
are the only major country on Earth 
that does not guarantee paid sick days. 
In Germany, workers are entitled to 
84 weeks of paid sick leave at 70 per-
cent of their salary. In Norway, work-
ers are entitled to 1 year of paid sick 
leave at 100 percent of their salary. In 
the UK, workers are entitled up to 28 
weeks of paid sick leave. 
The railworkers in the United States 
are not asking for 1 year of paid sick 
leave. They are not asking for 6 
months of paid sick leave. They are 
asking for 15 days—15 days. The rail in-
dustry has said, as I understand it, that 
they just cannot afford to do that, just 
don’t have the money. They say it 
would cost too much money to provide 
their workers with any paid sick days. 
They just can’t afford to do it. Well, 
let’s see. They made over $20 billion in 
profits last year, and they provide 
their CEOs with huge compensation 
packages. 
And here is something else that ev-
eryone should know who is getting in-
volved in this issue: Last year, the rail 
industry spent over $18 billion, not to 
improve rail safety, not to address the 
supply chain crisis in America, but to 
buy back its own stock and hand out 
huge dividends to its wealthy stock-
holders. In fact, since 2010, the rail in-
dustry has spent over $183 billion on 
stock buybacks and dividends. 
So here is where we are. It turns out 
that guaranteeing 15 paid sick days to 
rail workers would cost the industry a 
grand total of $688 million a year. That 
is less than 3.5 percent of their annual 
profits. It seems to me if four major 
rail carriers can afford to spend over 
$18 billion a year on stock buybacks 
and dividends, please, please don’t tell 
me they cannot afford to guarantee 15 
paid sick days to their workers and 
allow these workers to have a reason-
able quality of life, which they don’t 
enjoy today. 
If the Burr-Wicker resolution passed, 
railworkers would be entitled to zero 
paid sick days and zero unpaid sick 
days. That is clearly unacceptable. 
The outrage over the lack of paid 
sick leave is not the only issue being 
negotiated. The railworkers of this 
country are sick and tired of unreliable 
scheduling, which is having a horren-
dous impact on their personal and fam-
ily lives. In America today, railworkers 
are on call for up to 14 consecutive 
days, 12 hours a day. In fact, it is not 
uncommon for many railworkers to be 
on call virtually 24 hours a day with 
the requirement to report to work 
within 90 minutes for shifts that can 
last nearly 80 hours. 
My office has heard from railworkers 
who received calls from management 
at 2 in the morning requiring them to 
show up for work at 4 a.m. Again, this 
is not only unacceptable; it is dan-
gerous, and it has led to a substantial 
increase in the rate of injuries in the 
freight rail industry. 
If the Burr-Wicker resolution were to 
pass, these unfair and unsafe working 
conditions would be allowed to con-
tinue, threatening the safety not only 
of the workers, but of passengers, as 
well. 
Finally, the Burr-Wicker resolution 
could allow the freight rail industry to 
substantially increase the cost workers 
would have to pay for healthcare. 
Let us be clear. We are talking about 
an industry that not only made $20 bil-
lion in profits last year and spent over 
$18 billion on stock buybacks and divi-
dends, we are talking about an indus-
try that has slashed its workforce by 
nearly 30 percent over the last 6 years, 
leaving its remaining workforce woe-
fully understaffed and overworked. We 
are talking about an industry that has 
seen its profit margins nearly triple 
over the past 20 years. 
Today, what Congress should be 
doing is not passing the Burr-Wicker 
resolution and forcing railroad workers 
back to work under horrendous work-
ing conditions. What we should be 
doing is telling the CEOs in the rail in-
dustry: Treat your workers with dig-
nity and respect, not contempt. Do not 
fire workers for the ‘‘crime’’ of going 
to a doctor when they are sick. Make 
sure that your workers have 15 paid 
sick days and adequate time off to rest 
and spend with their families. At a 
time when you, the industry, are mak-
ing recordbreaking profits, do not in-
crease the cost of healthcare for your 
employees. 
The CEOs in the freight rail industry 
need to understand that they cannot 
have it all. The rail industry must 
agree to a contract that is fair and 
that is just, and if they are not pre-
pared to do that, it is time for Congress 
to stand on the side of workers for a 
change and not just the head of large 
multinational corporations. 
Railworkers have a right to strike 
for reliable schedules. They have a 
right to strike for paid sick days. They 
have a right to strike for safe working 
conditions. Railworkers have a right to 
strike for these benefits. The Burr- 
Wicker resolution would take these 
fundamental rights away from work-
ers. We cannot allow that to happen. 
Therefore, I object. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Objection is heard. 
The Senator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, the 
objection has been heard and the Sen-
ator from Vermont has that right. 
I wonder if the Senator would yield 
for a question concerning some asser-
tions that he has made. It is my under-
standing—and the Senator is correct in 
this regard—only two of the unions 
have actually voted in favor of this 
plan. Six others have—their leadership 
has agreed, and we have tentative 
agreements with six of those. So six 
plus the two is the eight I mentioned. 
Also, the Senator, I think, is mis-
taken in saying that there is no sick 
leave policy. That would be unbeliev-
able for the rail industry in this day 
and age. It works a little differently for 
the rail. Railroad employees operate 
trains and have a leave policy under 
which they first indicate unavailability 
for work, and when that unavailability 
is the result of illness, then they re-
ceive sick pay through a sickness ben-
efit under a statutory scheme. 
The Presidential Emergency Board 
heard arguments on both sides, rec-
ommended an additional paid leave 
day. And, again, I would stress that 
this comes on top of a 24-percent wage 
increase. 
But the thing that really strikes me 
about what my friend from Vermont 
said is he seems to cast doubt on 
whether President Biden is actually for 
this PEB recommendation, and that 
needs to be cleared up. If the Senator 
from Vermont is suggesting that Presi-
dent Biden is not behind this, then the 
White House needs to let us know im-
mediately because when the PEB re-
port was issued, the clear message from 
the White House is that President 
Biden was in favor of this and endorses 
this. 
So if there are people in the White 
House listening to this, if the President 
of the United States is following this 
debate, then he needs to clarify this. If 
he is backing out on his support for the 
PEB, we need to know that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. My understanding, I 
say to my colleague from Mississippi, 
is that as we speak, the Secretary of 
Labor is in a room—or has been today, 
with management and labor in trying 
to forge an agreement. So what is 
going on right now is they are trying 
to reach an agreement which is ame-
nable to both sides, so that is a work in 
process. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Madam President, it is 
clearly apparent by listening to this 
debate, if Senator SANDERS had been on 
the 
PEB 
board, 
the 
PEB 
board 
wouldn’t be making a recommendation 
and the President wouldn’t be behind 
it. But that is where we are, short of a 
breakthrough in the negotiations that 
are occurring and going on. 
I grew up listening to Paul Harvey.

September 14, 2022 
news, the stuff you didn’t hear. Let me 
do Paul Harvey on Senator SANDERS. 
The railroad workers today get 3 
weeks paid leave on average, plus 11 
paid vacation days. PEB made a rec-
ommendation that they get 1 addi-
tional paid leave day. We will add that 
in. That is almost a month of paid 
leave. Regardless of what you call it, 
there is a month there. 
You now mentioned this wasn’t as lu-
crative as Germany and UK. I was 
home all of August. Nobody was ask-
ing: Geez, can you pass legislation that 
makes us look more like the UK or 
Germany or the rest of Europe? And I 
would be willing to bet that 27 paid 
leave days probably is more than some 
of the European countries. 
Mr. SANDERS. Would you like to bet 
on that? 
Mr. BURR. I will turn to you when I 
finish, how about that? I gave you a 
gracious amount of time. 
The PEB board determined this was a 
good solution. And Senator SANDERS 
says he is here looking out for the mid-
dle class because nobody does that. 
Tell me this: How are you looking out 
for the middle class when you are risk-
ing losing $2 billion a day in economic 
activity? Some of those people that 
you are talking about standing up for, 
if this rail strike continues, they are 
going to lose their job because of you. 
They are going to lose their job be-
cause the President took a position and 
you didn’t support him. 
I have been amazed with this admin-
istration. I find it pretty difficult sit-
ting up here taking the President’s po-
sition because the CDC today, 78 per-
cent of the CDC workforce does not 
show up at the office more than 2 days 
a month. We are in the middle of 
COVID. We have a monkeypox national 
medical emergency, and 78 percent of 
CDC employees—Centers for Disease 
Control—do not go to the office in At-
lanta. As a matter of fact, by, I think, 
the New York Times report, even the 
Secretary doesn’t go into the office. At 
a time where you ought to have leader-
ship, the leadership is gone. 
Let’s give the President a little bit of 
credit. He is showing some leadership. 
He realizes this is not good for every 
American. It doesn’t matter whether 
you are rich or poor or in the middle. 
Having $2 billion a day of negative eco-
nomic impact is not good. It will ruin 
people’s lives, just like COVID, just 
like monkeypox has done to some 
Americans. 
I am not sure how in good conscience 
you can roll the dice and say: Boy, 24- 
percent increase in pay retroactive to 
2020—not 2022, 2020—$1,000 bonus, and 27 
paid leave days per year, somehow we 
are cheating them. It is beyond me. 
But an objection has been heard, and 
now it means this is in Senator SCHU-
MER’s hands. He is the majority leader. 
He can bring this legislation up on the 
floor. All he needs is 60 votes because I 
am convinced, after hearing Senator 
SANDERS, he is not going to have an 
epiphany tonight and wake up tomor-
row and say: I was wrong, I am for this. 
But here is the promise I will make 
to Senator SCHUMER. If he will bring it 
to the floor, I will produce 48 Repub-
lican votes for it. That means Demo-
crats only need to produce 12 people to 
support it to keep the American people 
from having a $2 billion-a-day eco-
nomic impact negatively impacting 
them. It will keep the flow of goods 
from the east coast to the west coast, 
and Amtrak will open up again. Christ-
mas that comes in from overseas will 
hit L.A., Seattle, everywhere, and it 
will make it to its retail location 
where my wife can buy it. You could 
probably squeeze 12 Democratic votes 
just out of coastal communities that 
have ports that are going to be the real 
loser in this. 
Remember, not long ago we had a 
port problem. We had ships that were 
sitting off L.A. that couldn’t unload, 
and we felt the impact of it. Well, if 
you thought that was bad, wait until 
there are no trains because then they 
will be unloading no ships. They are all 
going to sit off the shore. When they 
back up like that, that backs up fur-
ther and further when these goods are 
going to come in because once they un-
load here, they are going to go back 
and get more. 
It also means that what we export in 
this country, there are no containers 
and no ships coming in to export those 
goods. If you are in agricultural terri-
tory at harvest time, this is going to be 
devastating to you. There are 160 mil-
lion freight cars of agriculture trans-
ported every year, and it happens in 
this period. 
So I say to my colleagues, let’s all 
hope that Senator SCHUMER will bring 
this up, that he will take Republicans 
up on their position of supporting the 
President and a solution to this prob-
lem, and that all he needs to do is 
produce 12 folks, and at any point, we 
can pass this legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. I was not aware Sen-
ator BURR was a railroad worker, so let 
me, just to set the record straight, tell 
you what the railroad workers them-
selves understand the situation is. We 
might want to listen to those who live 
the experience. So let me very briefly 
quote you a statement from Jeremy 
Ferguson, president of SMART Trans-
portation Division, and Dennis Pierce, 
president, Brotherhood of Locomotive 
Engineers and Trainmen, Teamsters 
Rail Conference. 
This is what they say about their 
working conditions: 
Penalizing engineers and conductors for 
getting sick or going to a doctor’s visit with 
termination must be stopped as part of this 
contract settlement. Let us repeat that, our 
members are being terminated for getting 
sick or for attending routine medical visits 
as we crawl our way out of a worldwide pan-
demic. No working-class American should be 
treated with this level of harassment in the 
workplace for simply becoming ill or going 
to a routine medical visit. 
That is from the unions themselves. 
So let us be clear. I don’t think any-
body wants a strike or wants a lockout. 
We hope that a settlement will be 
reached in the next day. But, in my 
view, if we are going to reach a settle-
ment, I would hope that the railroads, 
which are making huge profits, start 
treating their workers with the respect 
that they deserve. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ap-
preciate the debate on this. Here is 
where we are on this issue. We are 
going to have a nationwide strike with-
in a day and a half from now, midnight, 
12:01 a.m., Friday. 
There are two things that could stop 
this. The distinguished majority leader 
can bring this PEB recommendation to 
the floor, and we will produce the Re-
publican votes to get President Biden’s 
administration’s recommendation en-
acted. Send it to the House. The other 
thing that can happen is for President 
Biden to do as I have called on him to 
do just a few moments ago—to make it 
clear that this is, in fact, his rec-
ommendation, his endorsement of the 
plan that has been put forward by the 
Board he appointed; make that clear 
and exercise the Presidential leader-
ship that is needed at this point to per-
suade his friends and the four holdout 
unions that this is what needs to be 
done. 
But that is where we are. If we don’t 
have one of those two actions, then we 
will have done nothing, and we will see 
a strike and the economic devastation 
that the distinguished Senator from 
North Carolina has described. It is real-
ly up to the Democratic leader and the 
President of the United States. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
am very pleased to be on the floor 
today 
with 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
HIRONO to express our strong support 
for the nomination of Dr. Geeta Rao 
Gupta to be Ambassador at Large for 
Global Women’s Issues at the Depart-
ment of State. 
The position that Dr. Gupta has been 
nominated for leads the Office of Glob-
al Women’s Issues, which is charged 
with advancing the rights and em-
powerment of women and girls around 
the world through U.S. foreign policy,

at 
our 
foreign 
policy 
through a gender lens that recognizes 
that women are half of the world’s pop-
ulation. 
Not only does the Office of Global 
Women’s Issues prioritize policies and 
programs to advance the status of 
women around the world, it ensures 
that U.S. policies incorporate a gender 
lens at all levels of policy and decision 
making. 
The last 21⁄2 years of the COVID–19 
pandemic have demonstrated why this 
office is more important than ever be-
fore. Around the world over those last

21⁄2 years, the gender gap has grown as 
a result of the pandemic. Girls are 
dropping out and staying out of school 
at a higher rate than boys. The female 
labor force participation rate has de-
clined, with women not only holding 
less secure jobs but also taking on 
more 
unpaid 
work 
at 
home 
with 
childcare and housing. 
Gender-based violence has increased 
to such an extent that UN Women, the 
U.N. body charged with advancing the 
rights of women globally, now warns of 
what they call a ‘‘shadow pandemic’’ of 
violence. 
These are issues of great consequence 
to half of the world’s population. They 
cannot be an afterthought. Gender eq-
uity, equality, and the empowerment 
of women and girls must be a focal 
point of U.S. foreign policy, and that is 
exactly what the Ambassador at Large 
is intended to facilitate. 
Unfortunately, this position has been 
unfilled for too long. Over the past 5 
years, beginning in the Trump adminis-
tration, the position of the Ambassador 
at Large for Global Women’s Issues has 
been filled for only 1 year, so 20 percent 
of the time over the last 5 years. 
During that time, we have endured 
an unprecedented global pandemic. We 
have ended a 20-year war in Afghani-
stan. We have watched as Vladimir 
Putin launched an unprovoked attack 
on Ukraine. We have experienced a sup-
ply chain crisis and suffered a global 
food shortage. And in every single one 
of these crises, women have been more 
acutely affected than men and affected 
in a different way than men. 
During the pandemic, women, who 
make up almost 70 percent of the 
healthcare workforce, have been those 
who have been on the frontlines of pro-
viding care for the sick and vulnerable. 
With the Taliban takeover of Afghan-
istan, women’s rights have been rolled 
back at an unprecedented rate, and we 
have seen—90 percent of the households 
in Afghanistan have food insecurity, 
and women are experiencing the great-
est part of that. 
Displacement 
from 
the 
war 
in 
Ukraine has left millions of women 
vulnerable to human trafficking, even 
as Russia continues to shell their 
homes and communities. 
The food insecurity from the supply 
chain crisis and global food shortage 
has reinforced our understanding of 
what we have seen for too long: that in 
times of hunger, it is women who eat 
last and who eat the least. 
Through all of these crises, the Office 
of Global Women’s Issues has been 
without a leader to spearhead its work 
to ensure that women’s needs are in-
corporated in every aspect of the U.S. 
response to these crises. Now, why does 
that matter? Well, not only do women 
make up 50 percent of the world’s popu-
lation, but what we know is that where 
women 
are 
empowered, 
they 
con-
tribute, give back more to their fami-
lies. They give back more to their com-
munities. The countries that empower 
women are more stable; they are more 
economically secure. 
This is a policy that is important not 
only to our foreign policy writ large 
but to our national security. That is 
why we need to fill this position and 
why we urgently need to confirm Dr. 
Gupta. 
Dr. Gupta has spent her career in 
service to gender equality and women’s 
empowerment. She knows better than 
most the impact that unfair gender 
norms and inequalities have on women 
and the importance of prioritizing 
women’s leadership. 
What is so unfortunate is that Dr. 
Gupta is being punished for her per-
sonal views on women’s reproductive 
choices. As the result of those personal 
views, those groups who oppose wom-
en’s reproductive choices are spreading 
falsehoods instead of facts. They are 
doing that, and unfortunately, too 
many of our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle have been willing to 
listen to those falsehoods without real-
ly looking at the facts. This sets a very 
dangerous precedent for all future 
nominees. 
Let me be clear. The Office of Global 
Women’s Issues does not lead on sexual 
and reproductive health and rights, nor 
does it provide information about abor-
tion services. 
When former President Trump nomi-
nated someone to lead the Office of 
Global Women’s Issues, I and my pro- 
choice colleagues in this body didn’t 
ask her what her position was on 
choice because we knew that was not 
the mission of the Office of Global 
Women’s Issues, and she was con-
firmed. And I think by all accounts, 
people thought she did a good job in 
the short time that she was there. 
So why are my Republican colleagues 
spreading these falsehoods? They have 
said that Dr. Gupta has advised the 
World Health Organization to support 
abortion as a human right. They have 
alleged that Dr. Gupta gave a speech 
saying that abortion should be an es-
sential service. They have alleged that 
the administration has plans to include 
abortion in the mandate of the Office 
of Global Women’s Issues. Let me be 
clear. There is no truth behind those 
allegations. 
If you missed it, let me say it again. 
There is no truth behind those allega-
tions. 
We cannot let this idea that because 
somebody has a personal position on an 
issue that affects them, that that 
means they cannot be considered for a 
position within the government. You 
know, 
based 
on 
that 
criteria, 
I 
wouldn’t be able to be considered for 
any position. 
So for the sake of Dr. Gupta’s nomi-
nation today and for the sake of all of 
those qualified women candidates who 
are going to come before the Senate in 
the future, we can’t let this divisive 
move become the status quo. We have 
to correct the record. We need to ap-
prove Dr. Gupta, and we need to get the 
Office of Global Women’s Issues back 
operating at full capacity. 
With that, let me yield to my col-
league from Hawaii, Senator HIRONO. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. I rise today in support 
of Dr. Gita Rao Gupta’s nomination to 
serve as Ambassador at Large for Glob-
al Women’s Issues, and I am glad to be 
here with my friend from New Hamp-
shire to argue for her confirmation. 
As head of the State Department’s 
Office of Global Women’s Issues, the 
Ambassador at Large leads our diplo-
matic efforts to promote the rights and 
empowerment 
of 
women 
and 
girls 
around the world. Who can argue with 
that kind of a mission? 
From supporting women’s economic 
participation to combating domestic 
and gender-based violence, this work is 
critically important, and Dr. Gupta is 
well-suited to take on this important 
task. Dr. Gupta has spent her life 
working to empower women across the 
globe. She has led several nonprofit or-
ganizations focused on advancing gen-
der equity and has served as cochair of 
the World Bank’s Gender-Based Vio-
lence Task Force. 
But for months now, Republicans 
have blocked consideration of her nom-
ination. Why? Not because she is un-
qualified. Dr. Gupta’s record is impec-
cable, and her qualifications are clear. 
No, Republicans are blocking her nomi-
nation simply because she supports the 
fundamental right of all women to 
make decisions about their bodies and 
their futures, including the decision to 
get an abortion. 
Apparently, it is no longer enough 
for my Republican colleagues to push 
their extreme anti-abortion agenda. 
Now that they have overturned Roe v. 
Wade, they are opposing anyone who 
expresses support for abortion access 
even if it is their personal view and not 
one they are going to be pushing for-
ward in the position that we are being 
asked to confirm them for. 
Last year, the Republicans did the 
same thing to President Biden’s nomi-
nee to be Deputy Administrator of the 
Small Business Administration, SBA, 
opposing his nomination because of 
their opposition to SBA’s totally law-
ful PPP loans to Planned Parenthood 
clinics providing critical healthcare to 
communities across the country. 
The Republicans, I have to say, have 
been on a tear about ‘‘How dare SBA 
provide these lawful PPP loans to 
Planned Parenthood?’’ Apparently, it 
escapes their notice that these are law-
ful loans. 
So Republicans’ opposition to Dr. 
Gupta’s confirmation is a dangerous 
position and one that threatens the 
health, 
safety, 
and 
prosperity 
of 
women here in the United States and 
around the world. 
For example, my Republican col-
leagues raised concerns about the state 
of women and girls in Afghanistan, and 
yet in another example of their hypoc-
risy, they are opposing a nominee who 
would be in a position to actually help 
support these women. 
As Ambassador at Large for Global 
Women’s Issues, Dr. Gupta will bring

decades 
of 
experience to empower 
women, improve their economic secu-
rity, and end violence against women 
and girls. 
There is no legitimate reason for 
anyone to not support her nomination 
to this important role. The chaos and 
fear across the country generated by 
the Supreme Court’s Roe decision is 
spilling over to block this nomination. 
I thank Senator SHAHEEN
for her 
focus on Dr. Gupta’s nomination and 
her dedication to women and girls at 
home and abroad, and I urge my Re-
publican colleagues to do the right 
thing for a change and end their bad 
faith obstruction of Dr. Gupta’s nomi-
nation. 
I yield back to my colleague from 
New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Senator 
HIRONO, and thank you for your elo-
quent remarks about Dr. Gupta’s quali-
fications and the importance of having 
someone who has those kinds of quali-
fications at the Office of Global Wom-
en’s Issues. 
At this time, I ask unanimous con-
sent that notwithstanding rule XXII, 
the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee be discharged and the Senate 
proceed to the following nomination: 
PN1578, Geeta Rao Gupta, to be Ambas-
sador at Large for Global Women’s 
Issues; that the Senate vote on the 
nomination with no intervening action 
or debate; that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table; that no further motions be in 
order to the nomination; and that any 
related statements be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. HAGERTY. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Dr. Gupta received a 
tie vote in the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. There is a Senate 
process that has been agreed to by both 
parties by which the leader can dis-
charge a nomination with a tie vote 
from this committee to bring it before 
the full Senate, if he so chooses. 
I am saying this as a person who has 
been put through 30 hours of cloture 
himself when I served in the executive 
branch and went through this very 
process. 
We should not break from Senate 
process and procedure with regard to 
Dr. 
Gupta’s 
nomination. 
Members 
should have the opportunity to vote, 
and the majority leader can schedule 
it. 
Additionally, I think the vast major-
ity of Senators from both sides value 
the economic empowerment of women 
everywhere around the globe. The pre-
vious administration made economic 
empowerment for women worldwide 
one of its signature initiatives. 
I served as a diplomat at that time in 
the previous administration, and the 
senior Senator from New Hampshire 
was a valuable partner in many of our 
efforts, which I very much appreciate. 
So I think that there is a goal we 
share, but there are valid concerns on 
our side that the current administra-
tion is tainting this worthy goal and 
dismantling the bipartisan achieve-
ments of the previous administration. 
We deserve to have a better under-
standing of what this administration is 
doing before we rush ahead and totally 
bypass the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee to confirm the person who 
will be the chief implementer of this 
administration’s policies. 
I am not comfortable giving consent 
to expedite consideration of this nomi-
nee. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
can buy that answer. Senator HAGERTY 
and I have worked together on the For-
eign Relations Committee. I voted for 
you to be an Ambassador. I thought 
you did a good job in that role, and I 
think you are doing a good job now. 
But the fact is that taking up floor 
time to deal with qualified nominees at 
a time when we have limited floor 
time, when we have a position that 
needs to be filled, when we have a mi-
nority position on the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee in opposition to au-
thorizing permanently the Office of 
Global Women’s Issues tells me it is 
something more than that, and I think 
Dr. Gupta’s stalled nomination is em-
blematic of the intransigence on con-
firming President Biden’s nominees for 
the Department of State. 
That obstructionism is undermining 
our diplomatic efforts. It is demor-
alizing to employees at the Depart-
ment of State who have dedicated their 
lives to U.S. foreign policy, and I know 
you understand that because you head-
ed an Embassy. You know how critical 
our employees are who manage our for-
eign policy. 
Eric Rubin, a former Ambassador to 
Bulgaria, recently spelled out what 
this means for U.S. diplomacy and na-
tional security, and this is the concern 
that we all ought to have. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
this article from Puck News. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Sept. 6, 2022] 
WASHINGTON’S NEW CRISIS OF DIPLOMACY 
(By Julia Ioffe) 
As of this writing, it has been 593 days 
since an American ambassador has inhabited 
the Villa Taverna, their official residence in 
Rome. Ever since the financier and Repub-
lican donor Lewis Eisenberg moved out at 
the end of Donald Trump’s administration on 
January 21, 2021, no one has replaced him. 
President Joe Biden never nominated any-
one, which raised eyebrows both in American 
foreign policy circles and in Italy. The Ro-
mans I’ve spoken to are furious and see it as 
a sign of unprecedented disrespect, espe-
cially at a time when Washington is asking 
its European allies—including countries de-
pendent on Russian gas, like Italy—to hold 
the line on anti-Russian sanctions. ‘‘It’s the 
only G7 country with no U.S. ambassador,’’ 
one American diplomatic insider told me. ‘‘I 
know the Italians are unhappy and they 
should be, given the situation politically and 
what’s going on with Russia.’’ Given that 
Russia is rumored to have had a hand in the 
collapse of Mario Draghi’s sanctions-friendly 
coalition government this summer, the fact 
that Washington doesn’t have a representa-
tive on the ground is more than embar-
rassing. It’s downright negligent. 
Currently, the United States is represented 
in Italy by Shawn Crowley, who is the charge´ 
d’affaires. That’s fine, but a charge´ doesn’t 
have the same rank and status as an ambas-
sador, and receiving countries have all kinds 
of protocols and rules about who can meet 
with whom. Usually, a charge´ has a much 
lower ceiling for whom they can meet than 
an ambassador; the rank itself can be quite 
limiting. ‘‘The Italians,’’ noted the diplo-
matic insider, ‘‘are very protocol conscious.’’ 
As are the Ukrainians—so much so that, de-
spite all the aid the U.S. has poured into his 
country, President Volodymyr Zelensky re-
fused to meet with the American charge´ d’af-
faires until a real American ambassador, 
Bridget Brink, arrived in Kyiv this May. 
Why has Biden left the post in Rome un-
filled for so long? It’s been an open secret in 
Washington that the president is holding the 
spot for Nancy Pelosi, the first Italian-Amer-
ican Speaker of the House and a minor celeb-
rity in Italy. The idea, apparently, was to 
give her a nice, cushy retirement gig after 
Republicans take over the House. But why 
not nominate someone, like a career foreign 
service officer, to serve in the post, and then 
shoo them out once Pelosi ripens to the idea? 
All ambassadors, after all, serve at the pleas-
ure of the president. I asked spokespeople at 
both the State Department and the White 
House about this, but they wouldn’t—and 
couldn’t—explain to me, even off the record, 
what the hell is going on there, not even 
after Fox News published its own story about 
the Pelosi rumors on Tuesday. 
Pelosi’s people, meanwhile, offered a famil-
iar line: Why would Pelosi go get another job 
when she could just retire to Napa, and play 
with her grandkids? ‘‘Fox is just trying to 
start shit,’’ one source close to the speaker 
told me. ‘‘There are no conversations with 
the White House. And I’ve just heard [Pelosi] 
say ‘S.F. is heaven on earth’ one too many 
times to believe that she would realistically 
want to spend her post-Speaker life any-
where but home with family.’’ Which is also 
the exact kind of thing you might say before 
you take a job like that. 
The Italian imbroglio is just the tip of the 
diplomatic iceberg. Over a year and a half 
into Biden’s administration, more than 20 
percent of American ambassadorships re-
main unfilled. Nearly 40 of them have a 
nominee that is pending confirmation, in-
cluding for strategically vital posts, like the 
Czech Republic, Latvia, and the Nether-
lands—all crucial allies in holding the line 
against Russia on Ukraine. There is no 
American ambassador in Saudi Arabia, a 
fraught but important ally, and there hasn’t 
been one since Biden’s inauguration. India, 
the world’s largest democracy, hasn’t had an 
American ambassador since then either. The 
current nominee, L.A. mayor Eric Garcetti, 
has been in confirmation purgatory for more 
than a year, held up over allegations that he 
knew about his chief of staff’s alleged sexual 
predations. In limbo, too, is the nomination 
for the ambassador to the U.N.’s Conference 
on Disarmament. Apparently, the U.S. Sen-
ate does not consider nuclear disarmament a 
pressing matter. 
Fifteen more posts are completely vacant, 
with no nominee anywhere in sight. The 
abandonment of some places, like Cuba and

Afghanistan, make some sense. Other places, 
like Ethiopia, or Estonia, which is a crucial 
NATO ally, do not. ‘‘There is no reasonable 
explanation for why more than 20 percent of 
our ambassadorships overseas remain un-
filled,’’ said Eric Rubin, president of the 
American 
Foreign 
Service 
Association, 
which tracks such things. ‘‘This is not a 
world in which we can coast and assume that 
the rest of the world will wait for us to sort 
out our parochial difficulties. No other coun-
try leaves key diplomatic posts vacant so 
frequently and for so long.’’ 
The problem, though, is that there is an ex-
planation. In fact, there are several. It began 
with Trump gutting the State Department 
and the career foreign service. The people he 
had nominated to represent the United 
States were comically unqualified if not out-
right problematic. Once Biden came in, 
Washington expected him to right the ship. 
He had been, after all, an old member of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a 
vice president that had handled some of the 
most complex foreign policy matters under 
President Barack Obama. He boasted about 
his foreign policy chops as well as the coterie 
of smart, experienced advisors he was bring-
ing in with him: the best and the brightest. 
And yet, here we are, more than a year and 
a half later, and one-fifth of the president’s 
ambassadors remain unconfirmed or even 
unnominated. The first problem for Biden 
was the Presidential Personnel Office, which, 
in true Democratic fashion, decided that if 
the previous administration was going to 
nominate people with criminal records or on-
going lawsuits for ambassadorships, they 
were going to do things with extra diligence. 
Chief of staff Ron Klain also decided he had 
to vet every single nominee, too, slowing the 
process even further. Meanwhile, over in 
Foggy Bottom, the State Department de-
cided that its people also had to be extra vet-
ted by diplomatic security, because everyone 
now had a digital footprint and social media 
presence. 
Then, last July, Texas Senator Ted Cruz 
took it upon himself to wage a one-man cam-
paign to kill the Nord Stream II project by 
putting a blanket hold on all the Biden ad-
ministration’s State Department nominees 
unless the White House got the German gov-
ernment to kill its pipeline. Since the Biden 
administration was not about to do so, this 
created a massive backlog—and that was be-
fore Missouri’s Josh Hawley instituted his 
own blanket hold, in September 2021, on 
State and Defense Department nominees un-
less Secretary of State Antony Blinken, De-
fense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and National 
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan resigned for, 
in his view, bungling the withdrawal from 
Afghanistan. 
Needless to say that never happened. By 
the time these holds were lifted early this 
year, the backlog had grown massive. And 
time on the floor of the Senate of the 117th 
Congress, which will gavel out on January 3, 
2023, had grown ever more precious. 
But before that, let’s pause to talk about 
how ambassadorial nominees get to the floor 
of the Senate for a vote. 
First, they have to be approved by the Sen-
ate Foreign Relations Committee, which is 
currently headed by New Jersey’s Bob 
Menendez, a Democrat, and Idaho’s Jim 
Risch, a Republican. Both men are steeped in 
foreign affairs and appear to all outside ob-
servers as serious thinkers about world 
events. But according to people who have 
regular dealings with the Foreign Relations 
Committee, they have a relationship that is 
closer to something out of Mean Girls. They 
are, as one source familiar with the com-
mittee described them to me, ‘‘like oil and 
water.’’ They have been known to be so 
laser-focused on messing with each other, in 
fact, that they regularly inhibit the func-
tioning of the Committee. Said one Senate 
staffer familiar with the workings of the 
Committee, ‘‘It’s an open secret that the 
challenges in their working relationship 
often impedes us from working together con-
structively on foreign policy and national se-
curity issues.’’ 
But there are other issues for ambassa-
dorial nominees to navigate inside the Com-
mittee, especially if they’re female. There is 
only one woman senator on the committee, 
New Hampshire’s Jeanne Shaheen, and so 
the women Biden has nominated often run 
up against the proclivities of the old men of 
the Senate, especially of the Republican per-
suasion. ‘‘There is certainly a layer of un-
conscious bias that is holding back a number 
of women, that isn’t there for the male 
nominees,’’ said the Senate staffer. This in-
cludes ‘‘spouses saying things about Trump’’ 
or ‘‘the way in which women talk and rep-
resent themselves, where Republicans have 
been viscerally opposed to just how the 
women communicate.’’ According to two 
sources, Sarah Margon, who had run the 
Washington office of Human Rights Watch 
and was nominated to lead the State Depart-
ment’s Office of Democracy, Human Rights, 
and Labor, ran into trouble when she met 
with Senator Risch, who pressed her repeat-
edly on her position on the BDS movement. 
She opposed it, she said repeatedly. After-
wards, Risch told colleagues he didn’t like 
Margon’s tone. (A committee spokesperson 
contended that, ‘‘The issue was not and has 
never been her ‘tone,’ it was her answers to 
the questions themselves.’’ The spokesperson 
did not, however, explain what was wrong 
with the answers.) 
Other women have been pressed by Com-
mittee Republicans on their stances on abor-
tion, even if the position they are nominated 
for has nothing to do with women’s health, 
let alone abortion. This happened, for exam-
ple, with Dr. Geeta Gupta, who was nomi-
nated to be the Ambassador to the Office of 
Global Women’s Issues. The post, and the of-
fice, deals with women’s security and eco-
nomic empowerment, and has nothing to do 
with women’s health, let alone reproductive 
rights. Yet Gupta was held up by Repub-
licans on the Foreign Relations Committee 
over her alleged support of abortion, sending 
Shaheen into a righteous fury. ‘‘Republican 
grandstanding that held Geeta Gupta’s nomi-
nation from advancing in the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee in July is a pivotal ex-
ample of this gross display of partisan poli-
tics,’’ Shaheen said in an email. ‘‘Repub-
licans prevented her nomination from pro-
ceeding to fill the urgently needed role as 
Ambassador at Large for Global Women’s 
Issues because of their obsession over wom-
en’s health and access to abortion—neither 
of which are under the jurisdiction of this 
role. Senate Republicans are putting our se-
curity in danger and our credibility on the 
world stage at risk—it needs to end now.’’ 
The guiding assumption seems to be that if 
they are women and Democrats, then they 
are automatically rabid abortionists and will 
use whatever diplomatic role to advocate for 
it, from Kyiv to Kinshasa. ‘‘Women nominees 
tend to face more rigor from Senate Repub-
licans and are frequently questioned about 
extraneous issues like their views on abor-
tion,’’ another Senate Democratic aide told 
me. ‘‘Some of this happens in public during 
hearings, but the majority of times it takes 
place behind closed doors when there are no 
cameras around to catch a senator and his 
staff go after women over issues well beyond 
the scope of the position for which they were 
nominated.’’ 
Once upon a time, ambassadorial nominees 
could count on cruising through the Senate 
on a vote of unanimous consent. They would 
be advanced as a block of nominees and 
voted through as a block, and people would 
only get singled out if they had truly bun-
gled their meetings with senators. The feel-
ing at the time was that the President of the 
United States deserved to pick his ambas-
sadors just as he deserved to pick his cabinet 
secretaries and the Senate was there only to 
weed out the truly rotten apples. 
No more. If a nominee even makes it out of 
committee for a floor vote, they are voted on 
individually, it takes several hours, and any 
senator can use the opportunity of their 
nomination to extract something from the 
administration. Some, like Hawley, have 
asked for the resignation of cabinet secre-
taries. Others have asked for small, stupid 
things like, for example, a visa for a friend in 
exchange for waving a nomination through. 
That is to be expected of Republicans who 
will do whatever they can to impede Biden’s 
agenda, but even some Democrats have 
caught on to the game. They have also 
learned that they can use any nomination to 
extract some choice morsel from the admin-
istration, whether it’s a pet issue or some-
thing they can flaunt to constituents back 
home. 
As a result, every single State Department 
confirmation hearing, ambassadorial or oth-
erwise, now resembles a hostage negotiation. 
‘‘This is not how the system is supposed to 
work,’’ said one insider the process. ‘‘You’re 
not supposed to negotiate for individual un-
related reasons. But people have started 
treating this as normal. I think nominations 
will look like this forever from now on.’’ 
Because of this, and because there are only 
four working weeks left on the Senate cal-
endar before the midterms, Majority Leader 
Chuck Schumer has made it crystal clear to 
his conference that ambassadorial nominees 
are now at the very back of the line. Why 
spend hours on the ambassador to Azerbaijan 
when you can ram through another lifetime 
judicial appointment to balance out the 
work done by Mitch McConnell when he had 
the majority? ‘‘You only have a certain num-
ber of hours a week,’’ one Senate aide famil-
iar with the process told me. ‘‘The more 
we’re spending it on ambassadorial nomina-
tions, the less we’re spending it on judges.’’ 
Added a Senate Democratic staffer, ‘‘It has 
been made clear that, through the midterms, 
the floor will be tied up with judicial nomi-
nees.’’ 
After the midterms, whether the Demo-
crats hold the Senate or not, it will be a new, 
118th Congress and that means all the am-
bassadorial nominations now floundering in 
senatorial purgatory will have to be resub-
mitted, and the process will begin again, 
from scratch. 
Both the White House and State, in their 
official statements to me, emphasized the 
number of ambassadors they were able to 
confirm, despite the unprecedented obstruc-
tion they’re facing in the Senate. Things are 
actually going pretty well, they say, all 
things considered. But privately, the tone is 
very different. People worry about recruiting 
and retention. Who in their right mind would 
want to go through a process like this? Oth-
ers worry about the irreparable harm this is 
doing to our relationships with allies and ad-
versaries abroad, especially after the calam-
ity that was the Trump presidency. 
‘‘It’s baffling to our foreign interlocutors 
because they don’t have these confirmation 
processes, and our inability to field ambas-
sadors when there are so many crises around 
the world is unbelievable to them,’’ one 
former State Department official told me. 
‘‘It’s also having a huge impact at State on 
morale and retention. I think because there’s 
so much uncertainty over how long it takes 
to get confirmed, the currency of an ambas-
sadorship is being devalued. You have people

waiting for a year or more to get confirmed. 
People have quit jobs for these posts. Others 
are waiting inside State, stuck in limbo for-
ever. I heard of someone who considered re-
tiring while waiting to be confirmed.’’ 
Eric Rubin, himself a former ambassador 
to Bulgaria and deputy chief of mission in 
Russia, is worried about what message this 
is sending to the two countries most eager to 
weaken and replace America on the world 
stage: Russia and China. ‘‘The U.S. no longer 
has the largest diplomatic service, China 
does,’’ Rubin told me. ‘‘The U.S. no longer 
has the most embassies and consulates 
abroad, China does. We have to stop tying 
one hand behind our backs in our efforts to 
represent our country and advance its secu-
rity and prosperity.’’ 
Or, in the words of the diplomatic insider, 
‘‘It’s malpractice.’’ 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Ambassador Rubin 
put it very starkly. He said: 
The U.S. no longer has the largest diplo-
matic service. China does. 
He concluded by saying: 
We have to stop tying one hand behind our 
backs in our efforts to represent our country 
and advance its security and prosperity. 
It’s malpractice. 
It is malpractice. 
The fact that too many people in this 
Chamber are dragging their feet on al-
lowing Ambassadors to be confirmed, 
on allowing diplomats with the Depart-
ment of State to be confirmed, on al-
lowing other high level people through-
out government to be confirmed be-
cause, only, of their opposition to the 
Biden administration is just untenable, 
and it is against our national security. 
So I think it is time now for the Sen-
ate to do its job to confirm Dr. Gupta. 
So let’s move forward. Let’s get our 
foreign policy with respect to gender 
throughout the world back on track. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mr. HAGERTY. Madam President, I 
have great respect for my colleague 
from New Hampshire. I worked very 
hard on the WGDP initiative that was 
put in place by the previous adminis-
tration. It has the potential to do so 
much good. 
I am very concerned about elements 
of that being dismantled right now, 
and I would like to remind my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
that this is a matter of priorities. 
Again, I will reiterate that I was put 
through 30 hours of cloture. The rules 
have been improved since then to re-
duce that amount of time. I think it 
would be a total of 4 hours in this case, 
yet the priorities set by the leadership 
of the other side indicate that they 
don’t care as much about these posi-
tions because they won’t even schedule 
it. 
It is certainly within the Senate ma-
jority leader’s power to do that. Rath-
er, the Senate majority leader would 
rather prioritize seating the Postal 
Board of Governors than putting Am-
bassadors into place. 
So I have difficulty with this argu-
ment, and, with all due respect, my ob-
jection stands. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
my colleague from Tennessee was just 
talking about priorities of this admin-
istration and this Senate, and I want to 
continue on that area of focus, relating 
to what many of us believe is probably 
the most important priority we have in 
the U.S. Senate, and that is defending 
our Nation. 
Budgets are a reflection of an admin-
istration’s values and an administra-
tion’s priorities. And as I mentioned, 
many of us—and I believe on both sides 
of the aisle—see that the No. 1 priority 
we should have in the U.S. Senate is 
making sure we are a strong nation, to 
defend this great country of ours and 
to make sure we have the most lethal, 
well-trained military anywhere in the 
world, and that we take care of our 
troops and their families. 
But this is not what this administra-
tion—the 
Biden 
administration—be-
lieves at all. In fact, President Biden’s 
budgets 
clearly 
not 
only 
do 
not 
prioritize our military; they put them 
consistently last. And that is not a 
one-time thing. This is a pattern with 
this administration. 
Here was the President’s proposed 
budget last year. Take a look at it. We 
all know it was trillions and trillions. 
Department of Commerce, 28 percent 
increase. EPA, 21 percent. Interior, 16 
percent—on and on. There are double- 
digit increases everywhere except—ex-
cept—in the two Agencies that actu-
ally protect the Nation: the Depart-
ment of Defense and the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
Last year, the Biden budget put for-
ward a budget that, if it was adjusted 
for inflation, was almost a 3-percent 
cut to the Department of Defense. 
Priorities matter. This administra-
tion has not prioritized our military at 
all. 
Guess who was really pleased by that 
budget, by the way? The dictator in 
Beijing and the dictator in Moscow. No 
doubt when they saw that, they loved 
it. 
Thankfully, 
the 
Armed 
Services 
Committee, on which I sit, said: Do you 
know what, Mr. President? With all 
due respect, this is nuts. We are not 
going to stand for this. 
We put forward in the National De-
fense Authorization Act last year a 3- 
percent real increase to the Depart-
ment of Defense budget. It was very bi-
partisan in the committee, a complete 
rebuke to the President of the United 
States, saying: We don’t believe in 
cuts. We are going to increase. The ap-
propriators, thankfully, did the same. 
So that was the Biden administra-
tion’s prioritization of our military 
last year. 
Now, what happened between last 
year and this year, when the most re-
cent budget came out? Well, I think a 
lot of us know, but I am going to talk 
a little bit about it. 
Russia invaded Ukraine, and at an 
April Armed Services hearing, the 
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
General Milley, said that the invasion 
was ‘‘the greatest threat to the peace 
and security of Europe and perhaps the 
world in any of my time of 42 years in 
uniform.’’ 
So this is the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff saying we are likely see-
ing one of the most dangerous periods 
anywhere in the world in terms of na-
tional security in the last four decades. 
That was testimony from the Presi-
dent’s own Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. 
That is Russia. And, of course, their 
ally China is also taking incredibly ag-
gressive actions all around the world. 
They are beginning to outcompete our 
country on many fronts—critical min-
erals, energy, technology. 
Certainly, Xi Jinping, the dictator of 
Beijing, has increased China’s aggres-
sion all around the world—in India, 
threatening to invade Taiwan, eco-
nomic aggression toward Australia, 
snuffing out liberty in Hong Kong. 
What else has China done? It is dra-
matically increasing its defense spend-
ing—more than 7 percent this year—in-
creasing a navy that is almost becom-
ing larger than ours. 
This is how General Milley, again, 
put it in a hearing last April: 
We are now facing two global powers, 
China and Russia, each with significant mili-
tary capabilities, both of whom intend to 
fundamentally change the current rules- 
based global order. We are entering a world 
that is becoming more unstable and the po-
tential for significant international conflict 
between great powers is increasing, not de-
creasing. 
So that is the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, again. 
Now, what do you think the Presi-
dent did, seeing we had this incredibly 
dangerous period internationally, with 
his next budget? Last year, as I men-
tioned, he cut the Pentagon defense 
budget by almost 3 percent and dead 
last with Homeland Security in terms 
of Agencies. 
So did he listen to his Chairman? 
Does he really think it is that dan-
gerous? Let’s see. 
This is this year’s defense budget and 
other priorities from this administra-
tion’s multitrillion dollar budget, and, 
once again, you see the EPA coming in 
at a 24-percent increase. Commerce, 
HHS, and Labor are all double-digit— 
Interior, DOJ. 
What about the Department of De-
fense? It is a 4-percent increase with al-
most 9-percent inflation. We are talk-
ing close to a 5-percent real cut to the 
Department of Defense. This is out-
rageous. 
Last year, the President put forward 
almost a 4-percent cut to defense 
spending. In the interim period, we had 
one of the most dangerous wars that 
has happened—certainly in Europe and 
maybe in the world—in a generation. 
The President’s own Secretary of De-
fense and the Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff come before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee and say it 
is an incredibly dangerous time—a pe-
riod, maybe, in almost 50 years in

September 14, 2022 
which we haven’t seen so many threats 
to the international order. And the 
President does what? He, once again, 
prioritizes our defense almost dead 
last—almost dead last. Adjusted for in-
flation, it is a 5-percent cut. 
Now, with this posture hearing for 
the Secretary of Defense and Chairman 
Milley, I asked the question: Gentle-
men, with all due respect, you just said 
it is the most dangerous period in al-
most the last 50 years. How can you 
come before this committee and put 
forward a budget that is almost a 5-per-
cent cut to the Department of Defense 
and our troops? 
They didn’t have a good answer. The 
truth of the matter is, I am quite cer-
tain that the uniformed military and 
probably even Secretary Austin do not 
support this budget, but they are good 
soldiers. They had to salute the Com-
mander in Chief and try to support it. 
But we don’t have to support it, and I 
know the American people certainly 
don’t support it. Once again, I do know 
two people who support it. Vladimir 
Putin and Xi Jinping look at this, and 
this is something they are very pleased 
with. 
Once again, the Armed Services Com-
mittee, when we met to mark up the 
NDAA, voted in an overwhelming bi-
partisan fashion—23 to 3—to, once 
again, dramatically rebuke the Presi-
dent in a bipartisan way and signifi-
cantly increase the top line for the De-
partment of Defense to make sure we 
have a strong nation and that our 
troops are taken care of and their fami-
lies by almost $45 billion over what the 
President requested. It was a bipar-
tisan rebuke, once again, of this ad-
ministration that won’t prioritize our 
national security and that keeps put-
ting forward budgets that prioritize the 
defense of our Nation last. 
We also started in this NDAA to 
course-correct, which we need to do 
dramatically at the Pentagon. We have 
had civilian leadership, primarily driv-
en by the Biden administration’s far- 
left nominees, who have not been fo-
cusing the Pentagon on its top pri-
ority, which is to win our Nation’s 
wars and to make sure we have the 
most lethal military of any country in 
the world. So I was able in this NDAA 
to put forward some amendments that 
I was glad to get bipartisan support on, 
that are in the current NDAA, to start 
a course correction. 
First, one of my amendments directs 
the Pentagon to discontinue any fur-
ther investment in the DOD-wide effort 
to root out so-called extremism within 
the ranks. This has been an obsession 
of the civilian leadership at the Pen-
tagon, many of whom know nothing 
about the military. It is an obsession, 
given the incredibly low rate of ex-
tremist activity in our military as de-
termined by the Secretary of Defense’s 
own working group on this topic. 
The press didn’t write about that be-
cause they love to kind of weave into 
the story that somehow our military is 
full of extremists. Unfortunately, some 
of my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle play that up too. One Senator, 
at one point, said 10 percent of the 
military might be extremist—a ridicu-
lous besmirching of the men and 
women in our armed services. The ac-
tual report from the Secretary of De-
fense’s office found fewer than 100 cases 
of extremist activity in a total mili-
tary force of over 2 million people. 
When you do the math, that is less 
than .005 percent. 
So let me be clear: Extremism has no 
place in our military and must be root-
ed out when discovered, but these num-
bers simply don’t warrant the time and 
investment that our senior military 
has put into this issue. So, in the 
NDAA, we have said we are not funding 
it anymore. 
There is a second issue in the NDAA 
for which I was able to put forward an 
amendment. The Department of the 
Army and the Department of the Air 
Force, according to press reports, were 
starting to devise a policy that would 
allow each servicemember to veto their 
duty assignment if they disagreed with 
the laws and regulations in a State or 
in a community where they were going 
to be assigned by the military. 
Could you imagine the chaos that 
would result if every soldier, marine, 
sailor, or airman could say: ‘‘You 
know, I don’t want to go to California; 
its regulations on the Second Amend-
ment are overly burdensome on my 
Second Amendment right,’’ or for any 
other reason? 
So we said, in the NDAA, a policy 
that gives service men and women the 
ability to veto their assignments based 
on whether they want to go somewhere 
or not is not the way our military is 
going to operate. That has been nipped 
in the bud. 
Finally, there is a very simple 
amendment that I put forward that 
just provides clarity to the men and 
women of the Department of Defense. 
All it does is remind them of what 
their job is. The military is too often 
asked to do so many different things— 
to focus on climate change and to focus 
on so many other issues. The military 
has one job: to provide combat-credible 
military forces needed to deter our ad-
versaries, to protect the security of our 
Nation, and to win our Nation’s wars 
when called upon to do so. 
I put forward an amendment that 
said just that: Here is your priority, 
and here is what you are supposed to 
do. It is needed because of all of the 
things that our top civilian leaders are 
now telling the troops they should be 
focused on. They should be focused on 
prevailing in a war if they are called on 
to do so, and that is what my amend-
ment did. Believe it or not, a number of 
Senators voted against it, but that also 
made the Defense Authorization Act 
this year. 
In addition to significantly increas-
ing the Department of Defense’s au-
thorized budget, we are starting to, 
once again, get the military focused on 
their primary job: lethality and win-
ning wars. 
So we need to bring the NDAA to the 
floor. We have passed it 66 years in a 
row. As I mentioned, the administra-
tion’s priorities are clearly not with re-
gard to national defense and our mili-
tary. We can tell by the budget that 
has been put forward. In the Senate, 
priorities are often determined by the 
time on the floor to get a piece of legis-
lation moving. It is clear to everybody 
who has been here that the majority 
leader does not prioritize the military 
in the same way that the President of 
the United States doesn’t. 
We passed the NDAA in June—the 
Armed Services Committee did—in a 
huge bipartisan vote. The House passed 
its NDAA in the House in July. So we 
are waiting to bring up one of the most 
important pieces of legislation we 
work on every year: the legislation 
that sets the policy and funds our 
troops and their families. 
Where is it? 
Senator SCHUMER, where is it? When 
are we going to bring it up? 
You have Democrats and Republicans 
who are looking at this floor time in 
September, saying: We need to bring up 
the NDAA. 
The rumor, right now, is that the ma-
jority leader plans to bring it up in De-
cember. 
Think about that, America. 
I don’t even know what we are doing 
right now on the Senate floor—minor 
nominations. We should be bringing up 
the NDAA to protect this country and 
to make sure the men and women in 
our military know we have their backs. 
Right now, nobody has any idea— 
maybe the majority leader does—as to 
when we are actually going to bring 
this most important bipartisan piece of 
legislation to the floor. 
This is why I joined in a letter that 
we sent out today, led by Senator 
TUBERVILLE, who serves on the Armed 
Services Committee with me, signed by 
20 of my colleagues. By the way, I 
know it would have been signed by 
some Democratic colleagues as well. 
They didn’t want to put their names on 
the letter, but they feel the same. It 
says to the majority leader: You con-
trol the Senate. You control the prior-
ities of this body. Bring up the NDAA 
by the end of September. 
Here is the letter. I ask unanimous 
consent that it be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
U.S. SENATE, 
Washington, DC, September 13, 2022. 
Hon. CHARLES E. SCHUMER, 
Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
LEADER SCHUMER: At the founding of our 
nation, then-General George Washington 
penned, ‘‘When the civil and military powers 
cooperate, and afford mutual aid to each 
other there can be little doubt of things 
going well’’. Two centuries later, that still 
rings true. Yet should this body fail in its 
top Constitutional responsibility of pro-
viding for a common defense, our armed 
services will be left directionless, lack stable

Chairman 
Reed 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
Inhofe saw to it that the FY2023 National De-
fense Authorization Act remained bipartisan 
and the result safeguards the United States. 
Additionally, the bill invests in technology 
advancements and procurement through a 
$45 billion budget topline increase, provides 
service members with a 4.6 percent pay raise, 
and strengthens our forces in cybersecurity, 
space, the Indo-Pacific, personnel manage-
ment, and many other areas. 
Members of the House passed their NDAA 
on July 14th, by a vote of 329–101. For the bill 
to go to conference and make it to President 
Biden’s desk, our colleagues must have the 
opportunity to debate the Senate version 
with an open amendment process. As such, 
we the undersigned respectfully request that 
you call the James M. Inhofe National De-
fense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 
to the Senate floor before the conclusion of 
the September work period.

Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
the letter says: 
At the founding of our nation, then-Gen-
eral George Washington penned, ‘‘When the 
civil and military powers cooperate, and af-
ford mutual aid to each other there can be 
little doubt of things going well.’’ 
As General Milley said, at one of the 
most dangerous times in recent his-
tory, it is vital that our civil and mili-
tary powers cooperate. 
What we need to do in this body right 
now is get back to the important work 
of bolstering our economy, of fighting 
inflation, of bringing down energy 
costs, of unleashing American energy, 
and, most importantly, of passing the 
NDAA so we can bolster the national 
security of this great Nation in very 
dangerous times. 
I call on the majority leader, along 
with 20 of my colleagues and some of 
my Democratic colleagues, to bring the 
NDAA to the floor and not wait until 
the end of the year, which is what we 
hear he is planning to do. 
I yield the floor.

NATIONAL

WAR 
AND MISSING IN ACTION REC-
OGNITION DAY 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, Friday, 
September 16, 2022, marks the National 
Prisoners of War and Missing in Action 
Recognition Day. On this day, we join 
together to honor the brave men and 
women of our Armed Forces who have 
been prisoners of war and for those who 
remain missing in action, including the 
477 Mainers still unaccounted for. This 
solemn day is a painful, important re-
minder of the sacrifices endured by 
servicemembers and the immense, in-
calculable loss and uncertainty borne 
by their families and communities. Let 
us renew our commitment to bring an-
swers and closure to the loved ones of 
those missing in action and to care for 
all those who have endured the painful 
silence of these losses. 
Today, I join people across Maine and 
our Nation in saying, ‘‘You Are Not 
Forgotten.’’ The phrase is reminder of 
our duty to leave no American service-
member or veteran behind, no matter 
where they may be. I stand humbled 
and grateful to those who answered the 
call of their Nation to protect our way 
of life. We also pay tribute to those 
who have been POW/MIA and have re-
turned to their loved ones. We have a 
solemn obligation to take care of them 
and their families so that they can 
enjoy the freedoms they sacrificed for. 
To the families who have lost their 
sons and daughters and to the com-
rades who have lost their friends and 
companions, know that today and 
every day we stand with you through 
your hardships and in honoring the 
selfless service of America’s POW and 
MIA. 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO CURTIS D. ROBINSON 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Mr. Curtis D. 
Robinson, a long-time resident of Con-
necticut and outstanding entrepreneur 
and philanthropist who turns 80 on 
September 21, 2022. 
As a teenager, Mr. Robinson left Bir-
mingham, AL, and the segregation of 
the Jim Crow South, arriving in Hart-
ford, CT, in 1958 with little more than 
the clothes on his back. Mr. Robinson 
began working two full-time jobs and 
one part-time job and, after several 
years, was able to purchase a grocery 
store at the age of 18. By the time he 
was 22, Mr. Robinson also owned a res-
taurant, a cleaning service, an apart-
ment building, and a construction sup-
ply company. He used this experience 
to start the Small Business Develop-
ment Program in 1969, creating over 100 
small businesses in the Hartford and 
Springfield areas. This remarkable suc-
cess is a testament to Mr. Robinson’s 
extraordinary industrious spirit and 
tremendous work ethic. 
Today, Mr. Robinson is the owner, 
operator, and president of C&R Devel-
opment Company, the largest minority 
construction management company on 
the east coast. He also owns several 
shops within Bradley International 
Airport and runs other businesses, in-
cluding R&G Services, which operates 
the shuttle bus service at the airport, 
and R&G Parking, which operates one 
of the largest parking lots in downtown 
Hartford. 
In addition to his entrepreneurial en-
deavors, Mr. Robinson is also an advo-
cate for health equity. As the co-
founder and chairman of the Curtis D. 
Robinson Center for Health Equity— 
CDRCHE—he expands the provision of 
critical health services in underserved 
communities, serving over 10,000 people 
since 2010. Expanding on this firsthand 
experience in addressing health inequi-
ties, Mr. Robinson sits on the boards of 
Trinity Health of New England, Saint 
Francis Hospital and Medical Center, 
and the Connecticut Hospital Associa-
tion. 
Mr. Robinson is also an extraor-
dinary philanthropist and has contrib-
uted greatly to the civic life of Con-
necticut. Along with his wife, Mr. Rob-
inson founded the Curtis and Sheila 
Robinson Foundation, which provides 
financial support across a variety of 
areas—offering assistance with food, 
rent, 
clothing, 
transportation, 
and 
scholarship funds for individuals in 
need. Over the years, they have cham-
pioned many worthy causes, including 
efforts to combat food insecurity, do-
mestic violence, and poverty. The Rob-
insons have also assisted individuals 
with medical and hospital care, do-
nated buses to churches and schools, 
and adopted a homeless shelter for dis-
placed children. Their charitable con-
tributions are truly too numerous to 
list, and I applaud their remarkable ef-
forts to give back to their community.

RECOGNIZING THE AL J. 
SCHNEIDER COMPANY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the Al J. Schneider 
Company for 75 years of service and 
contribution to the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky. 
On September 30th, 1947, the Al J. 
Schneider Company began its service 
by building barracks and other mili-
tary facilities on Fort Knox. The com-
pany has since built and owned four of 
the largest hotels in Louisville, includ-
ing the Galt House Hotel, the Execu-
tive Inn and Executive West—now 
known as the Crowne Plaza Louisville 
Airport—the Waterfront Office Tower, 
and One Riverfront Plaza, as well as 
many 
other 
commercial 
properties 
throughout Louisville. 
The Al J. Schneider Company was 
founded with the belief that great 
things in great cities are done by the 
people in the city, including the $80 
million reinvestment of the Galt House 
Hotel and the employees who serve our 
community. 
The Al J. Schneider Company has 
also taken great pride in supporting 
the local community with devout sup-
port of the Catholic Church, invest-
ment in the University of Louisville, 
Simmons College of Kentucky, Louis-
ville Metro Police Foundation, King 
Solomon Missionary Baptist Church, 
and many other nonprofits throughout 
the Commonwealth. 
I am proud to salute the Al J. 
Schneider Company for their 75 years 
of service and accomplishments and 
have no doubt they will continue to 
play an integral role in bettering the 
Commonwealth.∑

RECOGNIZING MCCALL LAKE 
CRUISES 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today, I am pleased to 
honor McCall Lake Cruises as the 
Idaho Small Business of the Month for 
September 2022. 
For the last 10 years, McCall Lake 
Cruises has operated The Idaho on 
Payette Lake, sharing with visitors 
and locals alike a history of the area, 
the ship, and Sharlie, the lake mon-
ster. The Idaho is a 62-foot, 85-pas-
senger cruise vessel built in northern 
Idaho in 1983. Its 360-degree view allows 
passengers to take in the scenic views 
and landscape that surround Payette 
Lake on both afternoon and sunset 
cruises throughout the summer. 
McCall Lake Cruises was acquired by 
Kyle and Jade Enzler, Steven and AJ 
Lee, and Ryan and Kelsey Parke at the 
start of the 2022 cruise season. All 
three couples have a deep love of 
McCall and, over the years, have trans-
lated that love into various ventures in 
the area, from renovating and running 
the Scandia Inn, to coordinating beau-
tiful McCall mountain weddings. This 
group of self-proclaimed Idaho enthu-
siasts knew a great opportunity when 
they saw one, so when the prospect of 
purchasing McCall Lake Cruises came 
about, they jumped at the chance. With 
the generous guidance of the previous 
owners and the help of The Idaho’s 
knowledgeable 
captains 
and 
crew, 
these six enthusiastic entrepreneurs 
kept this special Payette Lake tradi-
tion alive. 
Congratulations 
to 
McCall 
Lake 
Cruises for being selected as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for Sep-
tember 2022. Thank you for serving 
Idaho as small business owners and en-
trepreneurs. You make our great State 
proud, and I look forward to your con-
tinued growth and success.∑

pensive type of natural disaster in the 
United States; and 
Whereas, FEMA has reported that one inch 
of water pooled in a single-story, one thou-
sand square foot home can cause approxi-
mately eleven thousand dollars worth of 
damage; and 
Whereas, a home is the most valuable asset 
owned by many families; and 
Whereas, flood insurance is a product de-
signed to mitigate the cost of repairs needed 
due to flood damage by offering coverage at 
a rate based on certain risk factors; and 
Whereas, the National Flood Insurance 
Program (NFIP) offers a maximum of two 
hundred fifty thousand dollars of flood insur-
ance coverage for residential structures for 
families of one to four; and 
Whereas, beginning October 1, 2021, new 
flood insurance policies issued by NFIP are 
subject to the rating methodology known as 
Risk Rating 2.0; and 
Whereas, all flood insurance policies issued 
by NFIP that are renewed on or after April 
1, 2022 are subject to Risk Rating 2.0; and 
Whereas, the flood insurance rates for cer-
tain families are increasing up to eighteen 
percent per year; and 
Whereas, citizens of the town of Jean La-
fitte have elevated their homes but will nev-
ertheless pay higher flood insurance rates 
under Risk Rating 2.0; and 
Whereas, the language used to explain Risk 
Rating 2.0 in correspondence with policy-
holders is unclear to laypersons and difficult 
to understand; and 
Whereas, policyholders should receive cor-
respondence explaining Risk Rating 2.0 that 
utilizes language a policyholder can under-
stand without the assistance of legal coun-
sel; and 
Whereas, increased residential flood insur-
ance rates may discourage people from pur-
chasing homes in south Louisiana; and 
Whereas, a decrease in demand, as a result 
of increased flood insurance rates, may dis-
courage individuals and property developers 
from building new homes in south Louisiana; 
and 
Whereas, increased flood insurance rates 
may result in homeowners opting to not pur-
chase flood insurance, which would expose 
them to bearing the full expense of repairing 
their home if it is damaged by a flood; and 
Whereas, many homeowners would be un-
able to afford to repair their home if it were 
damaged by a flood and they did not receive 
flood insurance proceeds; and 
Whereas, flood insurance should be afford-
able to all citizens of Louisiana, including 
residents of coastal communities in south 
Louisiana; and 
Whereas, congress has oversight authority 
over federal administrative agencies, includ-
ing FEMA and NFIP; and 
Whereas, the members of the Louisiana 
congressional delegation have an obligation

September 14, 2022 
to effectuate federal legislative changes for 
the benefit of the citizens of Louisiana. 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to review and reform NFIP’s pricing 
methodology known as Risk Rating 2.0; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–208. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging and requesting the President of the 
United States, the Governor of Louisiana 
and the Louisiana Congressional Delegation 
to do everything in their power to halt fed-
eral actions resulting in the delay or can-
cellation of offshore oil and natural gas lease 
sales and strongly urge the U.S. Department 
of the Interior and the Biden Administration 
to expedite actions necessary to comply with 
the order by the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia to resolve Lease Sale 
257 and finalize a new five-year plan for oil 
and gas leasing on the outer continental 
shelf; to the Committee on Energy and Nat-
ural Resources. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 43 
Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico produces ap-
proximately seventeen percent of the U.S. 
crude oil and five percent of U.S. natural gas 
while contributing five to eight billion dol-
lars to the federal treasury each year and 
sends hundreds of millions of dollars to 
coastal states for coastal restoration and 
hurricane protection projects; and 
Whereas, the oil and gas industry directly 
supports two hundred forty-nine thousand 
eight hundred jobs in Louisiana and the oil 
and gas industry activities represent twenty- 
six percent of Louisiana’s Gross Domestic 
Product, accounting for nearly four and one 
half billion dollars in state and local tax rev-
enue in 2019 alone, with fourteen and one 
half percent of total state taxes, licenses, 
and fees collected; and 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management (BOEM) which regu-
lates offshore lease sales, the Gulf of Mexico 
continues to be the nation’s primary offshore 
source of oil and gas, generating about nine-
ty-seven percent of all U.S. outer conti-
nental shelf (OCS) oil and gas production; 
and 
Whereas, since 2017, Gulf of Mexico lease 
sales have generated more than one billion 
dollars from offshore leasing; and 
Whereas, since 1953, the U.S. Secretary of 
the Interior has been required by law to pre-
pare a five-year plan to set a schedule for oil 
and gas leases in U.S. offshore waters; and 
Whereas, it is a lengthy, multi-year regu-
latory process with multiple stages for pub-
lic comment, input, and consultation; and 
Whereas, the Obama Administration issued 
a five-year-plan for oil and gas leasing that 
expires on July 1, 2022; and 
Whereas, there are two remaining lease 
sales for the Gulf of Mexico authorized under 
the current five-year plan, including Lease 
Sale 259 and Lease Sale 261; and 
Whereas, the U.S. Department of the Inte-
rior (DOI) missed the deadline to issue a no-
tice of sale for Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 259 
in order to meet the expiration of the cur-
rent five-year plan; and 
Whereas, President Biden signed Executive 
Order 14008, Tackling the Climate Crisis at 
Home and Abroad, on January 27, 2021, de-
claring a pause on leasing on federal lands 
and waters, including the OCS of the Gulf of 
Mexico; and 
Whereas, the U.S. District Court ordered a 
preliminary injunction on the leasing pause 
and ordered federal oil and gas lease sales to 
proceed on June 15, 2021; and 
Whereas, the DOI held Lease Sale 257 on 
November 17, 2021; however, on January 27, 
2022, a ruling by the U.S. District Court for 
the District of Columbia invalidated Gulf of 
Mexico Lease Sale 257 requiring the DOI to 
reassess the environmental impacts of Lease 
Sale 257; and 
Whereas, the DOI is not appealing the 
court ruling and therefore there is no indica-
tion that leases will be awarded to the off-
shore companies; and 
Whereas, there is no indication that the 
federal government will hold another Gulf of 
Mexico offshore lease sale for the duration of 
President Biden’s term; and 
Whereas, there is no indication that the 
DOI is working on the next OCS five year 
plan; and 
Whereas, since December 2019 crude output 
fell slightly, with a drop of nearly thirteen 
and one half percent in offshore Gulf of Mex-
ico production; however, demand for oil has 
climbed nine and eight-tenths percent in the 
same period; and 
Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Secu-
rity Act (GOMESA), which allows Gulf states 
to share in offshore revenue generated from 
offshore oil activity including bonus bid rev-
enue, is the only reliable source of funding 
for Louisiana’s coastal programs; and 
Whereas, over the past five years Lou-
isiana has received between one hundred 
sixty million and four hundred seven million 
dollars from bonus bids alone; and 
Whereas, it is estimated that the state of 
Louisiana lost approximately twenty to 
forty million dollars in 2021 due to the can-
celled lease sales and lost bonus bid revenue; 
and 
Whereas, Louisiana depends on GOMESA 
revenues to fund a fifty billion dollar coastal 
restoration plan; and 
Whereas, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior 
is required by law to prepare a five-year plan 
to set a schedule for oil and gas leases in fed-
eral offshore waters; and 
Whereas, delaying or canceling Gulf of 
Mexico leasing negatively impacts federal 
and state revenue, as well as Louisiana busi-
nesses and jobs; and 
Whereas, drilling contractors will see im-
pacts dropping as many as one quarter of the 
remaining Gulf of Mexico rigs over the next 
several years; and 
Whereas, every drillship maintains an en-
tire network of staff, supply boats, and other 
vendors that support roughly one thousand 
jobs per rig; and 
Whereas, the Gulf of Mexico is the safest 
and cleanest oil produced anywhere in the 
world; and 
Whereas, halting domestic energy develop-
ment in one of the lowest carbon intensive 
energy producing regions in the world will 
shift production and capital investment 
overseas and undermine decades of environ-
mental progress; and 
Whereas, a 2016 Obama Administration 
study conducted by BOEM concluded that 
America’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 
will be only slightly affected by leasing deci-
sions on BOEM’s offshore leasing program 
and could result in an increase of GHG emis-
sions in the absence of new OCS leasing due 
to an increase in importing foreign oil; and 
Whereas, the current administration is 
pursuing a policy that places the U.S. at the 
mercy of the Organization of Petroleum Ex-
porting Countries (OPEC) and Russia to 
meet our domestic needs, harming our na-
tional and economic security; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby urge and request the president of 
the United States, the governor of Louisiana 
and the Louisiana congressional delegation 
to do everything in their power to halt fed-
eral actions resulting in the delay or can-
cellation of offshore oil and natural gas lease 
sales and strongly urge the U.S. Department 
of Interior and the Biden Administration to 
expedite actions necessary to comply with 
the order of the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia to resolve Lease Sale 
257 and finalize a new five-year plan for oil 
and gas leasing on the outer continental 
shelf; and be it further 
Resolved, That all efforts should focus on 
mandated lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That the clerk of the House is 
hereby directed to forward a copy of this 
Resolution to the president of the United 
States, the secretary of the interior, the sec-
retary of energy, the Federal Energy Regu-
latory Commission, the White House na-
tional climate advisor, the speaker and clerk 
of the United States House of Representa-
tives, the president pro tempore and sec-
retary of the United States Senate, and the 
members of the Louisiana congressional del-
egation.

Legislature of the State of Colorado con-
cerning support for Ukraine against Russian 
aggression; to the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 22–004 
Whereas, The post-war international secu-
rity order, led by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO), has relied upon diplo-
macy, peace, and open communication over 
armed conflict to ensure prosperity and sta-
bility for over one billion people for more 
than 70 years; and 
Whereas, Following the collapse of the So-
viet Union, the Ukrainian people voted over-
whelmingly to form a nation independent 
from Russia, building a democracy and a 
thriving country grounded in the rule of law; 
and 
Whereas, 
In 
2014, 
the 
pro-Western 
Euromaidan protest movement in Ukraine 
led to the resignation of authoritarian presi-
dent Viktor Yanukovych, a brutal ally of 
Vladimir Putin, ushering in democratically 
elected leaders who have sought closer ties 
to the European Union and the United 
States; and 
Whereas, The Russian Federation, seeking 
to block the free will of the Ukrainian people 
in their pursuit of security, peace, and pros-
perity through closer ties to the European 
Union and the United States, annexed terri-
tory from Ukraine in 2014 and instigated, 
supported, and supplied a deadly separatist 
war in Eastern Ukraine that has destabilized 
the region and killed thousands of civilians; 
and 
Whereas, The Russian Federation deployed 
military assets to support the separatist mi-
litias in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, 
resulting in the reckless missile attack that 
downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 and 
killed 298 innocent civilians in 2014; and 
Whereas, Vladimir Putin intentionally lied 
to his own people and to the global commu-
nity to create a false pretext to invade and 
occupy Ukraine based on lies that Ukraine 
posed a threat to Russians and that falsely 
connected Ukraine and its political leaders 
to Nazism; and 
Whereas, The Russian Federation violated 
international peace and security agreements 
that sought a peaceful solution in Eastern 
Ukraine and instead amassed hundreds of 
thousands of troops on Ukraine’s border; and 
Whereas, Vladimir Putin has now launched 
an unjust and unwarranted invasion upon 
the peaceful nation of Ukraine; and

Whereas, Russian soldiers are currently 
sweeping through the country, inflicting vio-
lence and terror upon millions of civilians 
and destroying homes, businesses, and prop-
erties; and 
Whereas, Ukraine is a proud and honorable 
nation under siege, and the brutality of this 
unnecessary and violent war is an affront to 
both international law and common decency; 
and 
Whereas, Ukraine has been a bulwark 
against Russian military aggression in Eu-
rope, and Vladimir Putin has said that his 
goal is to recreate the Soviet Union and may 
have intentions to threaten NATO allies 
with military force; and 
Whereas, Vladimir Putin has sought to de-
stabilize countries across Europe and inter-
fere in other countries’ elections and democ-
racies, including the United States; and 
Whereas, The United States has galvanized 
the international community and our allies 
to impose the strongest possible sanctions on 
Russia and its financial institutions in re-
sponse to the Russian invasion of Ukraine; 
and 
Whereas, Colorado is home to thousands of 
Ukrainian Americans and to millions who 
care deeply for and stand strongly in support 
of the Ukrainian people; and 
Whereas, Ukraine deserves the support of 
every American and the entire international 
community as it defends itself from this 
unprovoked Russian invasion, the largest at-
tack by one state against another in Europe 
since World War II; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Seventy-third 
General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the 
House of Representatives concurring herein: 
That we, the members of the Colorado Gen-
eral Assembly: 
(1) Proudly stand alongside Ukraine, its 
people, and its leaders during this horrific 
and unnecessary war and vow to support 
Ukraine and hold Russia fully accountable 
for its catastrophic decision to invade; 
(2) Condemn, in the strongest possible 
terms, Vladimir Putin’s violent attack on 
the people of Ukraine and strongly endorse 
the swift and severe economic sanctions and 
stringent export controls that President 
Biden’s administration has imposed on Rus-
sia; and 
(3) Urge Russia to immediately cease its 
violent, illegal, and immoral assault upon 
Ukraine, end the needless bloodshed, and re-
turn to diplomacy and the rules-based inter-
national order that has ensured peace and 
prosperity for so many. Be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolu-
tion be sent to the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, the Major-
ity Leader of the United States House of 
Representatives, the Minority Leader of the 
United States House of Representatives, the 
President of the United States Senate, the 
Majority Leader of the United States Senate, 
the Minority Leader of the United States 
Senate, and all members of Colorado’s Con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–210. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
encouraging the United States Congress and 
the President of the United States to take 
proactive measures to stand firmly against 
the totalitarian efforts of the world Marxist/ 
communist movement to protect the citizens 
of our great state and this nation from the 
leviathan and evil that is the Chinese Com-
munist Party; to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 13 
Whereas, the initial global Marxist/com-
munist movement was directed by the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and had 
as its declared objective, world control; and 
Whereas, world hegemony was to be ac-
complished through aggression, force, vio-
lence, and tactics that included fraud, espio-
nage, 
sabotage, 
infiltration, 
subversion, 
propaganda, terrorism, and treachery; and 
Whereas, since the 1991 collapse of the 
USSR and the Warsaw Pac the hegemonic 
and totalitarian nation-state of China has 
become the focal point for the spread of dan-
gerous and tyrannical Marxist, communist, 
and socialist influences around the globe and 
has recently aligned with the Russian Fed-
eration to act in concert against the West 
and the rest of the free world, and together 
they champion tenets of the former Marxist/ 
communist movement; and 
Whereas, the direction and control of the 
world Marxist/communist movement is now 
vested in and exercised by the People’s Re-
public of China (PRC); and 
Whereas, the PRC, subject to the dictato-
rial authority of the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP), is actively and surreptitiously 
furthering the purposes of the world Marxist/ 
communist movement; and 
Whereas, the CCP has established or 
caused the establishment of various action 
organizations and ‘‘front’’ companies, which 
are entities that are not free and inde-
pendent but components of the PRC’s appa-
ratus and that are controlled and directed by 
and subject to the discipline of the dictator-
ship in the CCP; and 
Whereas, the CCP conducts predatory 
trade practices and is suspected of facili-
tating the shipment of pirated and stolen 
goods and technologies, all of which harms 
Louisiana and American businesses and 
workers; and 
Whereas, the state of Louisiana, as a sov-
ereign political entity under the Constitu-
tion of the United States and as a func-
tioning 
representative 
state 
government 
that is responsible solely to the people of 
this state under the constitutions of this 
state and nation, is a most probable and ob-
vious target for those who seek by force, vio-
lence, subterfuge, and other unlawful means 
to overthrow constitutional government, so 
Louisiana is in perpetual danger of Marxist/ 
communist espionage, infiltration, subver-
sion and sabotage, which would put at risk 
the state’s economy, the international wa-
terway that is the Mississippi River which 
runs through Louisiana, and these actions 
will put at risk critical transshipment routes 
for oil, gas, grain, coal, and chemicals that 
are all linchpins of the state and nation’s 
economy; and 
Whereas, 
Marxist/communist 
expansion 
and ultimately control of a country is char-
acterized by an absolute denial of the right 
of self-government and by the abolition of 
those personal liberties which are cherished 
and held sacred in the state of Louisiana and 
in the United States of America; and 
Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana 
highlights the deaths of over seventy million 
Chinese citizens at the hands of its own state 
apparatus and dictators, the enslavement 
and on-going efforts to exterminate the 
Uyghur people and install Gulag-comparable 
oppression in the Xinjiang region, the mal-
treatment of minority citizens including 
peoples of color, maltreatment of homo-
sexuals, the lack of religious and press free-
doms, the persecution of people of faith, and 
draconian population control measures as 
the heinous benchmarks of the CCP that 
must be illuminated as actions the United 
States and Louisiana will not allow to en-
danger our great nation and state; and 
Whereas, communist action organizations 
and front companies, as established and uti-
lized in the United States, act under control, 
direction, and discipline of the CCP and en-
deavor to carry out the objectives of the 
world Marxist/communist movement under 
the guise of legitimate businesses and aca-
demic and political entities; and 
Whereas, the world Marxist/communist 
movement, which, emanating from the CCP 
and extending to all corners of the globe, 
aims to bring about the destabilization and 
subjugation of legitimate and free govern-
ments by any available means, including 
force when called for, and to set up totali-
tarian dictatorships that suppress liberty 
and eradicate human rights; and 
Whereas, those who unwittingly and/or 
sophomorically aid the advancement of these 
aims of the world Marxist/communist move-
ment and who participate in the subversive 
work of the movement in effect aid in the 
growth, influence, and detrimental presence 
of this cancer on liberty that extends from 
the CCP and are themselves victims of the 
world Marxist/communist movement; and 
Whereas, by insidious and ruthless tactics 
such as predatory economic actions, infiltra-
tion of institutions of higher learning, sabo-
tage, political party infiltration, propa-
ganda, and subversion, the agents of the 
world Marxist/communist movement are at-
tempting to lay the groundwork for the dis-
solution of the free society that is the 
United States of America and the state of 
Louisiana; and 
Whereas, by dangerous experiments, in-
cluding the possible release of deadly patho-
gens, and the testing and employment of bal-
ance-of-power changing weapons, the CCP 
puts the health and stability of the entire 
earth at risk; and 
Whereas, the world Marxist/communist 
movement is not a legitimate political effort 
but is in fact a tyrannical criminal con-
spiracy with an end goal of the ruination of 
western civilization and liberal democracy; 
and 
Whereas, because the world Marxist/com-
munist movement constitutes a clear and 
present danger to the citizens of the state of 
Louisiana and is an unequivocal enemy of 
this state and nation, the Congress of the 
United States and the president of the 
United States, in order to protect the people 
of the country and state, to preserve the sov-
ereignty of the state under the Constitutions 
of the United States and the state of Lou-
isiana, and to guarantee to the state a repub-
lican form of government, should enact ap-
propriate legislation recognizing the exist-
ence of the Marxist/communist movement 
and preventing it from accomplishing its 
purposes in the state of Louisiana and 
throughout these United States; and 
Whereas, the guarantees of sovereignty 
and freedom enjoyed by this state and its 
citizens are certain to vanish if the United 
States and its constitution are minimized, 
degraded, or destroyed by the Marxist/com-
munist movement. Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby encourage the Congress of the 
United States and the president of the 
United States to take proactive measures to 
stand firmly against the totalitarian efforts 
of the world Marxist/communist movement 
and to protect the citizens of our great state 
and this nation from the leviathan and evil 
that is the Chinese Communist Party; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation.

government agencies to grant assistance to 
pregnancy care centers for medical equip-
ment and abstinence education in a manner 
that does not compromise the centers’ mis-
sion or religious integrity; expressing the 
sense of the legislature regarding actions of 
any national, state, or local groups attempt-
ing to prevent pregnancy care centers from 
effectively serving women and men facing 
unplanned pregnancies; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 93 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers have a 
considerable and growing impact on the 
women, men, children, and communities 
they serve; and 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers serve 
women in Louisiana and across the United 
States with integrity and passion; there are 
more than two thousand five hundred preg-
nancy care centers across the United States 
that provide comprehensive care to women 
and men facing unplanned pregnancies by 
providing resources that meet their physical, 
psychological, 
emotional, 
and 
spiritual 
needs; and 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers offer 
women free, confidential, and compassionate 
services including pregnancy tests, peer 
counseling, twenty-four hour per day tele-
phone hotlines, childbirth and parenting 
classes, community health care referrals, 
and other support services; and 
Whereas, many medical pregnancy care 
centers offer ultrasounds and other medical 
services and provide information on adoption 
and adoption referrals to pregnant women; 
and 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers encourage 
women to make positive life choices by 
equipping them with complete and accurate 
information regarding their pregnancy op-
tions and the development of their unborn 
children; and 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers provide 
women with compassionate and confidential 
peer counseling in a nonjudgmental manner 
regardless of their pregnancy outcomes; they 
also provide important support and resources 
for women who choose childbirth over abor-
tion; and 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers ensure 
that women receive prenatal information 
and services that lead to the birth of healthy 
infants, and many centers provide grief as-
sistance for women and men who regret past 
choices; and 
Whereas, many pregnancy care centers 
also work to prevent unplanned pregnancies 
by teaching effective abstinence education in 
public schools; and 
Whereas, the federal government and state 
governments have increasingly recognized 
the value of the services offered by preg-
nancy care centers and have designated pub-
lic funds for such organizations; and 
Whereas, pregnancy care centers operate 
primarily through reliance on the voluntary 
donations and time of individuals who are 
committed to caring for the needs of women 
and promoting and protecting life, and the 
centers operating in Louisiana are most de-
serving of the highest recognition for their 
efforts. Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby commend and honor the preg-
nancy care centers of Louisiana and does 
hereby strongly support the positive con-
tributions pregnancy care centers make to 
the lives of women, men, and babies; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby commend the tens of thousands 
of volunteers and paid staff at pregnancy 
care centers in Louisiana and across the 
United States for their compassionate work; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
encourages Congress and federal and state 
government agencies to grant assistance to 
pregnancy care centers for medical equip-
ment and abstinence education in a manner 
that does not compromise the mission or re-
ligious integrity of these organizations; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature disapproves 
of the actions of any national, state, or local 
groups attempting to prevent pregnancy care 
centers from effectively serving women and 
men facing unplanned pregnancies; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the governor, the president of 
the United States, the presiding officers of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives 
of the Congress of the United States of 
America, and to each member of the Lou-
isiana congressional delegation. 
POM–212. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to support 
the Illegal Fishing and Forced Labor Preven-
tion Act and to take such actions as are nec-
essary to compel the United States Food and 
Drug Administration to fulfill its duties re-
garding inspection and testing of imported 
seafood; to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 78 
Whereas, according to the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration, in 
2019 the United States imported six billion 
pounds of edible seafood products, including 
one and one half billion pounds of shrimp, an 
increase of nearly six and one half million 
pounds more than the shrimp imported in 
2018; and 
Whereas, the 2019 shrimp imports alone, 
valued at six billion dollars, accounted for 
twenty-seven percent of the total value of 
imported seafood that year, which reached 
twenty-two billion dollars; and 
Whereas, it is estimated that over half of 
the imported seafood consumed in the United 
States is from aquaculture, or seafood farm-
ing, rather than wild-caught; and 
Whereas, the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) is responsible for the 
safety of all fish and fishery products enter-
ing the Unite States and sold in Louisiana; 
and 
Whereas, the FDA’s seafood safety pro-
gram is governed by its Hazard Analysis 
Critical Control Point regulations, which ad-
dress food safety management through the 
analysis and control of biological, chemical, 
and physical hazards from raw material pro-
duction, procurement and handling, to man-
ufacturing, distribution, and consumption of 
the finished product; and 
Whereas, FDA regulations are supposed to 
measure compliance for imported seafood 
with inspections of foreign processing facili-
ties, sampling of seafood offered for import 
into the United States, domestic surveil-
lance sampling of imported products, inspec-
tions of seafood importers, foreign country 
program assessments, and the use of infor-
mation from foreign partners and FDA over-
seas offices; and 
Whereas, in 2011 the FDA was only inspect-
ing two percent of the seafood imported into 
the United States; and 
Whereas, unfortunately 2011 is the last 
year for which data regarding the percentage 
of imports inspected is available due to a 
lack of transparency and inadequate assess-
ment measures; and 
Whereas, in 2011 the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) noted that the FDA’s as-
sessments of foreign aquaculture operations 
was limited by the FDA’s lack of 1 proce-
dures, criteria, and standards; and ten years 
later, a 2021 GAO report found that the agen-
cy was failing to monitor the effectiveness of 
its own enforcement policies and procedures; 
and 
Whereas, in contrast, the European Union 
regularly conducts physical checks of ap-
proximately twenty percent of all imported 
fish products that are fresh, frozen, dry, salt-
ed, or hermetically sealed, and for certain 
fishery products, physical checks are con-
ducted on approximately fifty percent of im-
ports; and 
Whereas, the Louisiana State University 
School of Renewable Natural Resources pub-
lished a 2020 paper titled ‘‘Determination of 
Sulfite and Antimicrobial Residue in Im-
ported Shrimp to the USA’’, which presented 
findings from a study of shrimp imported 
from India, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, 
China, Bangladesh, and Ecuador and pur-
chased from retail stores in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana; and 
Whereas, a screening of these shrimp for 
sulfites and residues from antimicrobial 
drugs found the following: (1) five percent of 
the shrimp contained malachite green, (2) 
seven percent contained oxytetracycline, (3) 
seventeen 
percent 
contained 
fluoroquinolone, and (4) seventy percent con-
tained nitrofurantoin, all of which have been 
banned by the FDA in domestic aquaculture 
operations; and 
Whereas, although the FDA requires that 
food products exposed to sulfites must in-
clude a label with a statement about the 
presence of sulfites, of the forty-three per-
cent of these locally purchased shrimp found 
to contain sulfites, not one package com-
plied with this labeling requirement; and 
Whereas, the drug and sulfite residues in-
cluded in this screening can be harmful to 
human health during both handling and con-
sumption and have been known to cause all 
of the following: liver damage and tumors, 
reproductive abnormalities, cardiac arrhyth-
mia, renal failure, hemolysis, asthma at-
tacks, and allergic reactions; and 
Whereas, the results of this study confirm 
that existing screening and enforcement 
measures for imported seafood are insuffi-
cient; whatever the percentage of imports in-
spected may be, seafood is currently being 
imported that contains unsafe substances 
that put American consumers at risk; and 
Whereas, because imported seafood is not 
held to the same standards as domestic sea-
food, domestic fishing industries are put at a 
distinct and significant disadvantage com-
mercially; and 
Whereas, according to the Louisiana De-
partment of Wildlife and Fisheries, the aver-
age value of Louisiana shrimp fell from three 
dollars and eighty cents per pound in 1980 to 
one dollar fifty cents per pound in 2017; and 
Whereas, this unfair competition allows 
foreign competitors to flood the United 
States market with seafood harvested under 
intensive 
farming 
practices 
using 
anti-
microbial drugs, while devastating local in-
dustries and the coastal communities built 
around them; and 
Whereas, proposed federal legislation co-
sponsored by Representative Garret Graves 
of Louisiana titled the Illegal Fishing and 
Forced Labor Prevention Act, originally 
filed as H.R. 3075 and as incorporated into 
H.R. 4521 of the 117th Congress, seeks to com-
bat illegal, unreported, and unregulated fish-
ing practices in the international seafood 
supply chain which contribute to the fore-
going inadequacies; and 
Whereas, the proposed legislation seeks to 
enhance monitoring, inspection, data collec-
tion, labeling, and transparency related to 
imported seafood; to improve the ability of 
United States regulators to enforce these 
measures; to increase outreach regarding 
seafood safety and fraud; and to appropriate

additional money for improved traceability; 
and 
Whereas, if enacted, the Illegal Fishing and 
Forced Labor Prevention Act could be an es-
sential step towards improving the safety of 
consumers and the market for domestic fish-
ing industries; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to support the Illegal Fishing and 
Forced Labor Prevention Act and to take 
such actions as are necessary to compel the 
United States Food and Drug Administration 
to fulfill its duties regarding inspection and 
testing of imported seafood; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–213. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Louisiana 
urging the United States Congress to take 
such actions as are necessary to invest fu-
ture supplemental funding in the commu-
nities of Lafitte, Barataria, and Crown Point 
located in Jefferson Parish aiding in flood 
protection and preventing future losses and 
damages; to the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity and Governmental Affairs. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 20 
Whereas, the population in Jefferson Par-
ish is approximately 429,711; and 
Whereas, Jefferson Parish is the third larg-
est parish in Louisiana; and 
Whereas, there are approximately 100,179 
properties in Jefferson Parish that have a 
greater than twenty-six percent chance of 
being severely affected by flooding; and 
Whereas, flood risks have increased in Jef-
ferson Parish, and there is an extreme risk of 
flooding over the next thirty years; and 
Whereas, Jefferson Parish has greater 
overall flood risk than ninety-nine percent of 
counties across the country; and 
Whereas, the Federal Emergency Manage-
ment Agency awarded a grant to aid in flood 
mitigation in Jefferson Parish; and 
Whereas, the United States Congress and 
the president of the United States did not in-
clude the communities of Lafitte, Barataria, 
and Crown Point; however, the state of Lou-
isiana received supplemental funding for the 
parishes of Lafourche, Terrebonne, Orleans, 
East Baton Rouge, Tangipahoa, and parts of 
Jefferson; and 
Whereas, continued investments in flood 
mitigation are needed to prevent future loss 
and damage resulting from natural disasters 
in the communities of Lafitte, Barataria, 
and Crown Point; and 
Whereas, 
the 
communities 
of 
Lafitte, 
Barataria, and Crown Point have suffered 
the adverse effects of the West Closure Com-
plex drainage system and the one hundred- 
year levees three miles north of the area; 
and 
Whereas, 
the 
communities 
of 
Lafitte, 
Barataria, and Crown Point have suffered 
the adverse effects of the sediment diversion 
on United States Highway 90 and will suffer 
from the proposed mid-Barataria sediment 
diversion; and 
Whereas, the extreme risk of flooding in 
Jefferson Parish has shown the urgent need 
to invest resources for the communities of 
Lafitte, Barataria, and Crown Point as a 
means to protect life and property in the fu-
ture, as citizens are continuously impacted 
by the flooding and rebuilding of their homes 
and lives; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to invest more resources into the 
communities 
of 
Lafitte, 
Barataria, 
and 
Crown Point to aid in future flood damage 
mitigation; and be it further 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to include the communities of Lafitte, 
Barataria, and Crown Point in any future 
supplemental funding and pre-mitigation 
funding to provide flood protection and to 
prevent future losses and damages; and be it 
further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
the Congress of the United States of America 
and to each member of the Louisiana con-
gressional delegation. 
POM–214. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the 
United States Congress to pass legislation 
that would allow farmers, along with coali-
tions and trade associations representing 
farmers, to petition the U.S. International 
Trade Commission to temporarily waive tar-
iffs on imports of fertilizer and fertilizer in-
gredients imported from Morocco; to the 
Committee on Finance. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 139 
Whereas, Michigan’s agricultural industry 
is vitally important to the state economy. 
As our nation’s second most diverse agricul-
tural system, it contributes more than $104.7 
billion in economic activity annually to the 
state. More than 800,000 people work in 
Michigan’s agricultural industry, and care 
for nearly 10 million acres of land; and 
Whereas, Fertilizer is a critical agricul-
tural input that is utilized by farmers to pro-
vide nutrients to their land and maximize 
the productivity of their farms. Michigan 
farmers require access to fertilizers in order 
to nourish their land and maintain produc-
tion levels; and 
Whereas, The International Trade Commis-
sion (ITC) determined that the import of for-
eign fertilizers injured U.S. manufacturers. 
As a result, the ITC decided to impose a 
nineteen percent tariff on imports of fer-
tilizer and fertilizer ingredients from Mo-
rocco. The tariffs, which were implemented 
in early 2021, significantly increased fer-
tilizer prices; and 
Whereas, Fertilizer prices in the United 
States are now at an all-time high. Fertilizer 
prices had already been increasing due to 
factors such as rising costs of raw materials 
and increased demand for inputs. With these 
tariffs in effect, farmers who were already 
struggling to compete with rising costs are 
now faced with an increased financial burden 
and uncertain future; and 
Whereas, Meanwhile, the U.S. continues to 
rely on imported fertilizer and fertilizer in-
gredients. For example, more than 95 percent 
of potash, one of the key components found 
in fertilizer, is currently imported from out-
side the U.S.; and 
Whereas, Michigan contains the only com-
mercial deposit of natural potash in the U.S. 
and the highest quality natural potash de-
posit in the world. The Michigan Legislature 
recently provided an investment of $50 mil-
lion to establish potash extraction infra-
structure in Michigan. Once completed, this 
project will help increase domestic supply of 
this critical mineral, thereby strengthening 
and securing the supply of high-quality pot-
ash for Michigan farmers, in addition to pro-
viding hundreds of full-time jobs and boost-
ing Michigan’s economy. This will be crucial 
for the Michigan agricultural industry, as 
significant 
supply 
shortages 
and 
sky-
rocketing costs continue to burden Michigan 
farmers; and 
Whereas, Legislation has been introduced 
in Congress that would allow a process for 
individual farmers, along with coalitions and 
trade associations representing farmers, to 
petition the ITC to temporarily waive tariffs 
on imports of fertilizer and fertilizer ingredi-
ents. With the price of fertilizer on the rise, 
this would help alleviate costs for farmers, 
as Morocco is one of the top five exporters of 
fertilizer to the United States; Now, there-
fore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge Con-
gress to pass legislation that would allow 
farmers, along with coalitions and trade as-
sociations representing farmers, to petition 
the ITC to temporarily waive tariffs on im-
ports of fertilizer and fertilizer ingredients 
imported from Morocco; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–215. A concurrent resolution adopted 
by the Legislature of the State of Arizona 
urging the United States Congress to allow 
the participation of Romania in the Visa 
Waiver Program; to the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT MEMORIAL NO. 2008 
Whereas, Romania has been a stable and 
flourishing multiparty democracy since the 
end of communism in 1989; and 
Whereas. Romania has a fast—growing, 
market—oriented economy and is a major 
economic partner of the United States; and 
Whereas, Romania is a member of the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), 
meets its defense spending benchmarks and 
is an active player in regional security; and 
Whereas, Romania is an important United 
States regional security ally and is a close 
partner in the areas of intelligence and joint 
security; and 
Whereas, Romania has been described as a 
‘‘stalwart NATO ally’’ by United States Sec-
retary of Defense Lloyd Austin and called a 
role model ally by senior defense officials; 
and 
Whereas, the Visa Waiver Program allows 
citizens of approved countries to travel with-
out a visa to the United States for stays of 
up to 90 days; and 
Whereas. despite the close United States- 
Romanian relationship, Romania remains 
one of only three European Union countries 
that are not in the Visa Waiver Program; 
and 
Whereas, Romania’s exclusion from the 
program hampers closer economic, cultural, 
political and security ties between our two 
countries. Wherefore your memorialist, the 
House of Representatives of the State of Ari-
zona, the Senate concurring, prays: 
1. That the United States Congress make 
changes to the Visa Waiver Program to allow 
Romania to become a participating country. 
2. That the Secretary of the United States 
Department of Homeland Security work 
closely with Romanian officials to quickly 
bring Romania into the Visa Waiver Pro-
gram. 
3. That the Secretary of State of the State 
of Arizona transmit copies of this Memorial 
to the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives, each Member of Congress 
from the State of Arizona and the Secretary 
of the United States Department of Home-
land Security.

tion to set a limit on the number of terms 
that a person may be elected as a member of 
the United States House of Representatives 
or as a member of the United States Senate; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 18 
Whereas, the United States and its citizens 
would be best served by limiting the terms of 
members of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives and United States Senate; and 
Whereas, under Article V of the Constitu-
tion of the United States, the Congress, on 
the application of the legislatures of two- 
thirds of the several states, shall call a con-
vention for proposing amendments to the 
Constitution of the United States; and this 
application shall be aggregated with the ap-
plications from other states to Congress to 
call a convention to set a limit on the num-
ber of terms that a person may be elected to 
the United States House of Representatives 
and the United States Senate for the purpose 
of attaining the two-thirds of states nec-
essary to require Congress to call a limited 
convention on this subject, but shall not be 
aggregated with any other applications on 
any other subject; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the senate, the assembly concur-
ring, That the legislature of the State of Wis-
consin herewith respectfully applies to Con-
gress, under the provisions of Article V of 
the Constitution of the United States, for 
the calling of a convention for the limited 
purpose of proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States to set a 
limit on the number of terms that a person 
may be elected as a member of the United 
States House of Representatives or as a 
member of the United States Senate; and, be 
it further 
Resolved, That the secretary of state of the 
State of Wisconsin be, and is hereby, di-
rected to forward a proper authenticated 
copy of this resolution to the President of 
the Senate of the United States, and to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives of 
the United States; and, be it further 
Resolved, That this resolution constitutes a 
continuing application for a convention for 
proposing an amendment in accordance with 
Article V of the Constitution of the United 
States until such a convention is convened 
on the same subject or until the legislature 
of the State of Wisconsin rescinds this reso-
lution. 
POM–217. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of New Jersey urging the 
United States Congress to pass a resolution 
condemning violence against historically 
Black colleges and universities; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 69 
Whereas, In January and February of 2022, 
at least 30 historically Black colleges and 
universities (HBCUs) were the targets of 
bomb threats; and 
Whereas, On February 7, 2022, House Con-
current Resolution 70 was introduced in the 
United States House of Representatives con-
demning the violence and threats of violence 
against HBCUs; and 
Whereas, HBCUs were established through-
out the 19th and 20th centuries in response to 
discriminatory 
practices 
that 
prevented 
Black Americans from pursuing higher edu-
cation; and 
Whereas, Quality higher educational op-
portunities are central to economic pros-
perity and social well-being in the United 
States, and dedicated educational opportuni-
ties for Black Americans are critical to the 
pursuit of economic and social equality for 
Black Americans; and 
Whereas, HBCUs are a symbol of independ-
ence and resilience for the Black community 
and provide important opportunities to up-
lift Black Americans; and 
Whereas, in 2020, enrollment at HBCUs to-
taled more than 275,000 students, and HBCUs 
continuously produce a significant share of 
the country’s Black leaders, innovators and 
artists, including Vice President Kamala 
Harris, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Toni Morrison; 
and 
Whereas, Bombings were a common tactic 
during the Civil Rights Movement to ter-
rorize Black institutions and members of the 
Black community; and 
Whereas, The bomb threats against HBCUs 
in the initial months of 2022 have disrupted 
campus 
environments, 
obstructed 
edu-
cational opportunities, increased anxiety, 
and instilled fear in students, faculty, and 
staff; and 
Whereas, in 2019, among single-bias hate 
crime incidents in the United States, 57.6 
percent of victims were targeted due to ra-
cial, ethnic, or ancestry bias, and among 
those victims, 48.5 percent were victims of 
crimes motivated by the offenders’ anti- 
Black or anti-African-American bias, accord-
ing to the FBI; and 
Whereas, The United States has a duty to 
protect citizens targeted by race-related 
hate crimes and prevent the continued per-
petration of these crimes; and 
Whereas, It is altogether fitting and proper 
for the United States Congress to pass House 
Concurrent Resolution 70 and thereby vocif-
erously condemn the threats of violence 
against HBCUs; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the State of New 
Jersey: 
1. This House supports, and respectfully 
urges the United States Congress to pass, 
House Concurrent Resolution 70, condemning 
the violence against historically Black col-
leges and universities and reaffirming the 
commitment of the federal government to 
combat violence against students, faculty, 
and staff at historically Black colleges and 
universities. 
2. Copies of this resolution. as filed with 
the Secretary of State, shall be transmitted 
by the Secretary of the Senate to the Major-
ity and Minority Leaders of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker and Minority 
Leader of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, and every member of the New 
Jersey Congressional delegation. 
POM–218. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Colorado con-
cerning the designation of March 8, 2022, as 
‘‘Colorado Aerospace Day’’; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 22–005 
Whereas, Our nation and the world have 
significantly benefited from technological 
and scientific advances resulting from space

opportunities 
throughout the state. Together they form 
the Colorado chapter of the Aerospace States 
Association, a nonpartisan organization of 
lieutenant governors and associate members 
from aerospace organizations and academia 
who represent states’ interests in federal 
aerospace and aviation policy development. 
Manufacturer’s Edge is a statewide manufac-
turing assistance center that encourages the 
strength and competitiveness of Colorado 
manufacturers by providing on-site technical 
assistance through coaching, training, con-
sulting, collaboration-focused industry pro-
grams, and leveraging government, univer-
sity, and economic development partner-
ships; and 
Whereas, The Colorado Air and Space Port 
seeks to serve as America’s hub for commer-
cial space transportation, research, and de-
velopment; this horizontal launch facility 
will have the potential to become the foun-
dation for a global suborbital transportation 
network connecting Colorado globally; now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Seventy-third 
General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the 
House of Representatives concurring herein: 
That we, the members of the Colorado Gen-
eral Assembly: 
(1) Strongly urge and request the govern-
ment of the United States of America to 
take action to preserve and enhance Amer-
ican leadership in space, spur innovation, 
and ensure our continued national and eco-
nomic security by increasing funding for 
space exploration and activities, including 
aggressively pursuing sending United States 
astronauts and the first woman onto the 
Moon in the next few years under the 
Artemis 
program, 
which 
will 
have 
its 
uncrewed test flight this month, sending 
along with it the Callisto payload, which 
uses Amazon Alexa and Webex by Cisco to 
test and demonstrate commercial tech-
nology for deep space voice, video, and 
whiteboarding communications. The Callisto

POM–219. A joint resolution adopted by the 
Legislature of the State of Wisconsin apply-
ing to the United States Congress, under the 
provisions of Article V of the United States 
Constitution, for the calling of a Convention 
of the States limited to proposing amend-
ments to the United States Constitution 
that impose fiscal restraints on the federal 
government, limit the power and jurisdiction 
of the federal government, and limit the 
terms of office for its officials and for mem-
bers of Congress; to the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION NO. 9 
Whereas, the Founders of our Constitution 
empowered state legislators to be guardians 
of liberty against future abuses of power by 
the federal government; and 
Whereas, the federal government has cre-
ated a crushing national debt through im-
proper and imprudent spending; and 
Whereas, the federal government has in-
vaded the legitimate roles of the States 
through the manipulative process of federal 
mandates, most of which are unfunded to a 
great extent; and 
Whereas, 
the 
federal 
government 
has 
ceased to live under a proper interpretation 
of the Constitution of the United States; and 
Whereas, it is the solemn duty of the 
States to protect the liberty of our people— 
particularly for the generations to come—by 
proposing amendments to the Constitution 
of the United States through a Convention of 
the States under Article V for the purpose of 
restraining these and related abuses of 
power: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the assembly, the senate concur-
ring, That the legislature of the State of Wis-
consin hereby applies to Congress, under the 
provisions of Article V of the Constitution of 
the United States, for the calling of a Con-
vention of the States limited to proposing 
amendments to the Constitution of the 
United States that impose fiscal restraints 
on the federal government, limit the power 
and jurisdiction of the federal government, 
and limit the terms of office for its officials 
and for members of Congress; and, be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That for purposes of this joint 
resolution, the phrase ‘‘limit the power and 
jurisdiction’’ means to restrict and constrain 
the power and jurisdiction of the federal gov-
ernment, and that this joint resolution does 
not authorize a convention for proposing any 
amendments that expand federal power or ju-
risdiction, or that legitimize any current use 
of federal power that is unauthorized by the 
original Constitution; and, be it further 
Resolved, That the secretary of state is 
hereby directed to transmit copies of this ap-
plication to the president and secretary of 
the United States Senate and to the Speaker 
and clerk of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives; to transmit copies to the mem-
bers of the said Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives from this state; and also to 
transmit copies hereof to the presiding offi-
cers of each of the legislative houses in the 
several States, requesting their cooperation; 
and, be it further 
Resolved, That this application constitutes 
a continuing application in accordance with 
Article V of the Constitution of the United 
States until the legislatures of at least two- 
thirds of the several States have made appli-
cations on the same subject. 
POM–220. A memorial adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Colorado urging the 
United States Congress to adopt comprehen-
sive voting rights legislation to protect the 
integrity of American democracy and the sa-
cred right to vote; to the Committee on 
Rules and Administration. 
SENATE MEMORIAL NO. 22–001 
Whereas, Every January we honor the 
memory of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and 
his heroic efforts to advance voting rights 
and we aspire to follow in his footsteps; and 
Whereas, No one did more to promote the 
right to vote for disenfranchised Americans 
than the civil rights leaders of the 1960s, in-
cluding Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Con-
gressman John Lewis, Fannie Lou Hamer, 
and Ella Baker; and 
Whereas, Until the United States Congress 
passed the federal ‘‘Voting Rights Act of 
1965’’, people of color in the United States 
were frequently subject to poll taxes, lit-
eracy tests, and fraud and intimidation, pre-
venting them from exercising their right to 
cast a ballot; and 
Whereas, The United States Senate is con-
sidering critical federal elections reform and 
long overdue updates to the federal ‘‘Voting 
Rights Act of 1965’’ to preserve voting rights 
for generations to come, in honor of the leg-
acy of the late Congressman John Lewis; and 
Whereas, 
Colorado’s 
electoral 
system 
serves as an example to the rest of the na-
tion, and in fact the world, of how to expand 
voter access while protecting electoral integ-
rity through safeguards including risk-lim-
iting audits and signature verification; and 
Whereas, In the 2020 election, Colorado had 
the second highest voter turnout of any state 
in the nation, and Colorado’s largest voting 
bloc—young people ages 18 to 34—turned out 
in record numbers; and 
Whereas, Efforts to suppress the vote and 
disenfranchise Americans who historically 
have had the least access to the ballot have 
been on the rise across the country in recent 
years; and 
Whereas, Last year, more than 440 bills 
with provisions that restrict voting access 
were introduced in 49 states, including here 
in Colorado, where legislation was intro-
duced to restrict voters’ access to Colorado’s 
vote by mail system, a national model of ex-
cellence for election access, security, and in-
tegrity; and 
Whereas, Last year, 19 states passed 34 
laws restricting access to voting, including 
Georgia’s Senate Bill 202 and Texas’ Senate 
Bill No. 1, both of which made it more dif-
ficult for voters to exercise their funda-
mental right to vote enshrined in the United 
States Constitution and the federal ‘‘Voting 
Rights Act of 1965’’; and 
Whereas, Falsehoods and conspiracies re-
garding the integrity of the 2020 election 
have run rampant in our media and public 
discourse; and 
Whereas, The months-long, coordinated at-
tempt to interfere with the democratic proc-
ess following the November 2020 election and 
prevent the peaceful transfer of power by 
overturning the legitimate results of the 
presidential election, which culminated at 
the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, 
serves as a violent reminder of the fragility 
of our democracy; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate of the Seventy-third 
General Assembly of the State of Colorado: That 
we, the members of the Colorado Senate: 
(1) Reassert the validity of the 2020 presi-
dential election results as legitimate and 
verified; 
(2) Offer Colorado’s premier electoral sys-
tem as a model for states across the country 
to adopt in order to increase voter participa-
tion while ensuring electoral integrity; and 
(3) Call on the United States Congress, and 
specifically members of the United States 
Senate, to pass comprehensive voting rights 
legislation to protect the fundamental right 
to vote, which has been the cornerstone of 
our democracy since the founding of our re-
public. Be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be 
sent to the Speaker of the United States 
House 
of 
Representatives, 
the 
Majority 
Leader of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, the Minority Leader of the 
United States House of Representatives, the 
President of the United States Senate, the 
Majority Leader of the United States Senate, 
the Minority Leader of the United States 
Senate, and all members of the Colorado 
Congressional delegation.

September 14, 2022 
United States Department of Veterans Af-
fairs’ report to the Asset and Infrastructure 
Review Commission; to the Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs. 
HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION NO. 27 
Whereas, the Alexandria Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center provides inpatient medical 
and surgical, inpatient mental health, com-
munity living centers, and outpatient serv-
ices to veterans in the surrounding area; and 
Whereas, the Alexandria Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center serves thousands of veterans 
a year, including a potential population of 
more than one hundred thousand veterans 
and an active patient roster of more than 
thirty-seven thousand veterans; and 
Whereas, the United States Department of 
Veterans Affairs recommends closing the Al-
exandria Veterans Affairs Medical Center fa-
cility and relocating services to community 
providers; and 
Whereas, the closing of the Alexandria 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center will leave 
veterans with fewer care options; and 
Whereas, Alexandria and Central Louisiana 
have a long history of support for the mili-
tary and serve as an ideal location for vet-
erans in surrounding communities to receive 
treatment; and 
Whereas, the Alexandria Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center is a critical institution that 
should remain operable to better serve the 
veterans of Louisiana: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana 
does hereby memorialize the United States 
Congress to take such actions as are nec-
essary to reject the report recommendations 
by the United States Department of Vet-
erans Affairs and support the continued op-
eration of the Alexandria Veterans Affairs 
Medical Center; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the

gressional delegation.

‘‘NATIONAL 
SPINAL 
CORD 
IN-
JURY AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Ms.

which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 764 
Whereas approximately 299,000 individuals 
in the United States live with spinal cord in-
juries, which cost society billions of dollars 
in health care costs and lost wages; 
Whereas there are approximately 18,000 
new spinal cord injuries in the United States 
each year; 
Whereas more than 42,000 individuals with 
spinal cord injuries are veterans; 
Whereas motor vehicle accidents are the 
leading cause of spinal cord injuries; 
Whereas nearly half of all spinal cord inju-
ries to individuals 30 years of age or younger 
occur as a result of a motor vehicle accident; 
Whereas the average remaining years of 
life for individuals living with spinal cord in-
juries has not improved significantly since 
the 1980s; 
Whereas there is an urgent need to develop 
new neuroprotection, pharmacological, and 
regeneration treatments to reduce, prevent, 
and reverse paralysis; and 
Whereas increased education and invest-
ment in research are key factors in improv-
ing outcomes for individuals living with spi-
nal cord injuries, enhancing the quality of 
life of individuals with spinal cord injuries,

fore, be it

prove the quality of life of individuals living

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL OF 
THE BETA BETA CHAPTER OF 
ALPHA PHI SORORITY AT MICHI-
GAN STATE UNIVERSITY 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the oldest women’s organiza-
tion in East Lansing, Michigan: the Alpha Phi, 
Beta Beta Chapter at Michigan State Univer-
sity. This year, they mark 100 years of fellow-
ship, sisterhood, and service to the commu-
nity. 
But the history of this beloved organization 
dates back even farther than a century. On 
March 20, 1891, The Feronian Literacy Soci-
ety was formed. It was the first all-women’s 
group at the Michigan Agricultural College 
(M.A.C.), the institution that later became 
Michigan State University. According to the 
1891 M.A.C. yearbook, two women worked to-
gether to create the initial concept, with stated 
goals to ‘‘advance its members’ intellectual, 
social and moral standing, to train mind, heart, 
and soul.’’ Together with 15 other women, 
they formed the initial membership. 
Given that there were only 20 women en-
rolled at Michigan Agricultural College at the 
time, it will come as no surprise that the group 
faced opposition from other literary societies 
on campus. But the Feronian women pressed 
on, trailblazers from the very start. In 1921, 
the ban on national Greek organizations was 
lifted at the college, and one of the first orga-
nizations to be established was Alpha Phi So-
rority—created by members of the Feronian 
Society. In 1922, the Feronian Society offi-
cially petitioned Alpha Phi Sorority to become 
the newest chapter, and the Beta Beta Chap-
ter of Alpha Phi was officially born. 
Just a few months later, the Beta Beta 
Chapter of Alpha Phi initiated 78 women to 
become the first women’s panhellenic group at 
Michigan Agricultural College. It remains the 
only sorority still in operation after 100 years. 
In 1935, the chapter was given $2,000 toward 
purchasing the land at 616 M.A.C. A few 
years later, women moved into this stately 
home, marking the debut of what is now 
known as ‘‘Sorority Row.’’ This house, now ex-
panded, has been the home-away-from-home 
for generations of Alpha Phi sisters. 
That sisterhood now includes thousands of 
women, and today I honor each one of them. 
I offer this tribute so that all may know of the 
courage and leadership of the women who 
blazed the trail from the Feronian Society to 
become the Beta Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi 
Sorority. May they continue to enrich the lives 
of Spartan women and their communities well 
into the future.

ALABAMA 
OUT-
STANDING YOUNG FARM FAMILY 
DANIEL AND CARLA TRANTHAM 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Daniel and Carla 
Trantham and their children, Davis, Sadie, 
Anna Kate, Sawyer and Callie for being 
named Alabama’s Outstanding Young Farm 
Family. 
The Tranthams are row crop and cattle 
farmers who run their own feed operation. 
They bag and sell over 80 tons of feed and 
grain on a weekly basis at their storefront in 
Alexandria and through feed stores. 
The Trantham family also sells wheat straw 
and Bermudagrass hay while improving yields 
on 1,000 acres of corn, wheat, soybeans and 
cotton through irrigation and seed selection. 
Since 2010, Daniel has more than doubled 
grain storage and tripled his cattle herd. 
The family also operates a trucking com-
pany where Carla manages payroll. 
The 
Tranthams 
are 
members 
of 
Leatherwood Baptist Church. Daniel is the 
local Young Farmers chair and serves on the 
Alabama Farmers Federation State Soybean 
Committee. Carla serves on the local Wom-
en’s Leadership Committee. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing this young family on this great honor. 
Congratulations to the Tranthams.

HONORING THE PITTSTON AREA 
HIGH SCHOOL SOFTBALL TEAM, 
PIAA 
CLASS 
5A 
STATE 
SOFT-
BALL CHAMPIONS 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor the Pittston Area Girls Softball Team 
on their perfect season and state champion-
ship win. On June 16, 2022, the Patriots 
clinched their 25th win of the season to be 
crowned the PIAA Class 5A state softball 
champions. 
Under the direction of head coach Frank 
Parente and Tori Para, Sage Weidlich, and 
Skylar Borthwick, three seasoned senior play-
ers as captains, the Patriots started the sea-
son believing they had the talent and the drive 
to do something special. They were right. 
They thrived during conference play in the 
second largest of PIAA’s six enrollment classi-
fications without losing a game. 
The team headed to the District 2 Class 5A 
softball 
championship 
game 
with 
an 
undefeated record and sailed to a 1–0 victory 
over West Scranton High School with pitcher 
Gianna Adams throwing a no-hitter. Now 21– 
0, the Patriots began their state championship 
run. 
After defeating South Western 13 to 0 and 
Lampeter-Strasburg, 
the 
defending 
state 
champions, 3 to 2, the team found themselves 
one game away from the state championship 
match, staring down the Oxford High School 
Hornets. Despite the Hornets rallying in the 
bottom of the sixth to score four runs, the Pa-
triots came out on top, securing their place to 
compete for the state title. This marked the 
first state championship game appearance for 
Pittston Area in any team sport in school his-
tory. 
On July 16, the Patriots took Penn State 
University’s Beard Field against the Armstrong 
High School River Hawks for the state cham-
pionship title. The River Hawks were looking 
for redemption after their loss to Lampeter- 
Strasburg in the title game in 2021. Bella 
Giardina helped the team secure an early lead 
with a two-run single, and Adams dominated 
from the pitcher’s mound. With two more runs, 
the Patriots secured a 4–0 lead over the River 
Hawks, which they held onto to be named 
state champions. 
I am honored to recognize the talented 
young women of the Pittston Area High 
School Softball Team on their outstanding 
season and state championship win. They 
have made the entire 8th Congressional Dis-
trict proud with their exceptional athletic prow-
ess and sportsmanship. May they continue to 
find success in their athletic pursuits and all 
their future endeavors.

THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS AND SERVICE OF ROB-
ERT PROCTOR 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to pay tribute to a lifelong community leader 
and the longest serving member of the Board 
of Trustees of Lansing Community College, 
Robert Proctor. Mr. Proctor has devoted near-
ly two decades to the service of the college, 
and has recently been recognized as the re-
cipient of the M. Dale Ensign Trustee Leader-
ship Award from the Association of Commu-
nity College Trustees. 
The list of Trustee Proctor’s accomplish-
ments and involvements at Lansing Commu-
nity College is long, as he has been a driving 
force in the development and expansion of 
many programs and initiatives during his ten-
ure. He currently serves as the board’s treas-
urer and historian, and is a past board chair 
who led two presidential search efforts. 
But his commitment to the community goes 
far beyond the college’s walls. Since arriving 
in Lansing in 1974 to serve as counsel for the 
Labor Committee of the Michigan House of 
Representatives, Robert has been involved in 
many civic, social, and professional organiza-
tions, nearly all of which list service to others

board of the Resolution Services Center of 
Central Michigan. He volunteers as a mediator 
for the Center and 54A District Court. Robert 
is a past president of Michigan State Univer-
sity Black Alumni and a former member of the 
board of directors of the MSU Alumni Club of 
Mid Michigan. He was a member of the board 
of directors of the Lansing Fair Housing Cen-
ter and was a fair housing tester. 
A lawyer by training, Mr. Proctor earned his 
bachelor’s degree in political science from the 
University of California, Berkeley and a juris 
doctor degree from Detroit College of Law. He 
is deeply connected to professional associa-
tions, and served as president of the Lansing 
Black Lawyers Association from 1996 to 1999. 
He is a member of the Michigan State Bar As-
sociation’s labor and employment law section; 
he served as a member of the section council 
for 4 years. While he has now retired from his 
service as an administrative law judge, he 
continues to practice law and serve as a medi-
ator and labor arbitrator. 
Trustee Proctor can only be described as 
the consummate public servant. It is fitting that 
his exemplary leadership, involvement, and 
commitment have been recognized by his 
peers, and it is equally fitting that I recognize 
him so that his lifetime of service will be 
known to all.

HONORING THE LIFE OF WALT 
MARR 
HON. GLENN THOMPSON 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, today I would like to recognize the 
passing of Pastor Walt Marr, of Elderton, 
Pennsylvania. 
Pastor Walt was a cherished leader in his 
community who embodied the values of fel-
lowship and neighborly love. He considered 
the Cornerstone Church in Indiana, PA his 
home, but Pastor Walt was always happy to 
help other ministries in need of his wisdom. 
Pastor Walt’s ministry of first-person reen-
actment was cherished throughout his commu-
nity. He had the unique skill of combining his-
torical and biblical lessons with engaging re-
enactments. His most notable reenactment of 
President Lincoln was a favorite of his, as it 
allowed him to combine his love of our coun-
try’s history with teachings of faith that were 
influential to President Lincoln. 
Pastor Walt was an example of what it 
means to truly live for others. His congeniality 
and humor will be dearly missed by many. 
The teachings he shared, and the examples 
he set by living them, are more relevant today 
than ever before. 
He will be remembered as a man who pos-
sessed a profound sense of faith and commu-
nity. He leaves behind a family and community 
that will sincerely miss him and his reenact-
ments. His positive contributions to his com-
munity will be remembered for years to come. 
May God bless Pastor Walt and his family. 
HONORING DR. DEREK MILES 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
individual, Dr. Derek Miles. Dr. Miles has 
shown what can be done through hard work, 
dedication, and a desire to achieve success. 
Dr. Derek Miles, a Cleveland, MS, urologist 
who serves the entire Delta region—including 
East Arkansas, in Helena—is celebrating the 
20th year of the opening of his practice which 
took place in August of 2002. The Kansas City 
native said he now considers himself a true 
‘‘Deltan’’ and has a passion for his work and 
serving his many patients in the region. 
Dr. Miles came to Cleveland fresh out of 
residency at the University of Missouri and 
started his urology practice. He is one of the 
few full-time urologists and physicians in the 
Delta keeping up his practice because so 
many others have either retired or moved on. 
Dr. Miles states that ‘‘Cleveland is incred-
ible, and I could not be more honored to prac-
tice and be based here and serve the Delta 
community. It’s now 20 years down and 20 
more to go, in my mind.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Derek Miles for his pas-
sion and dedication to serving his community.

HONORING 
LAKE 
ORION 
UNITED 
METHODIST 
CHURCH 
FOR 
150 
YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the Sesquicentennial Celebration of 
the Lake Orion United Methodist Church of 
Lake Orion, Michigan. 
Since its founding in 1872, this church has 
been a focal point of care and compassion for 
its members and for the community at large. 
Though the names of the committees and 
members have changed over the decades, the 
church’s commitment to being a light in the 
community shines as brightly as ever. 
During World War I, church property was 
donated to the Boy Scouts to grow potatoes, 
a precursor to the victory gardens that would 
eventually surface in many communities. The 
church’s annual report of 1917 noted both the 
extra demands of wartime, as well as the ex-
traordinary donations of its members in help-
ing those in need. Even as the community 
faced rations of food and fuel, generosity blos-
somed from the building, as the Lake Orion 
United Methodist Church increased its attend-
ance—sometimes in the basement to save on 
heating—and members increased their giving 
to support the church’s outreach and ministry. 
More recently, the Lake Orion United Meth-
odist Church has been instrumental in the 
founding of Oxford-Orion FISH, a food pantry, 
clothes closet and financial assistance organi-
zation that serves both communities. The con-
gregation’s goodwill extends to many other 
community groups which have supported the 
church’s Community Meals program, working 
with the church to make and assemble meals 
for delivery to area residents. These relation-
ships are fostered over time, with each partner 
deeply rooted in the development of Lake 
Orion over the past 150 years. 
The original lot where the church was built 
was a haven and refuge from the rough work 
of farming and lumbering. However, the rail-
road, among the first of innovations to change 
the rural landscape, removed the calm and 
quiet from Sunday services as tracks were laid 
next to the church, so the building was moved 
several blocks to the east in 1901. In one day, 
using logs to roll the building as it was pulled 
by a team of horses down Flint Street, with 
the whole town watching, the Lake Orion 
Methodist Church (as it was first founded) was 
placed 
in 
its 
current 
location. 
Today’s 
congregants enjoy the historical surroundings 
of the same building that laid its cornerstone 
in 1872, but in a slightly more tranquil setting. 
It is my honor to recognize the contributions 
and significant history of the Lake Orion 
United Methodist Church, and all of its 150 
years of service to the community. May they 
stand as a tribute to the pastorate’s lineage 
and its dedicated church members who built, 
moved and now carry on the legacy of this in-
stitution of Lake Orion, Michigan.

RECOGNIZING JAMES WIMSATT 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to wish James L. Wimsatt a happy 104th birth-
day. James is a World War II veteran and fix-
ture in the Owensboro community for his work 
to build up Kentucky through his artwork. 
James Wimsatt was born in Ohio County on 
September 18, 1918, to Thomas and Iva 
Wimsatt. Due to not being able to afford 
books, James took up painting and drawing 
and was considered gifted with art at a young 
age. 
Before leaving to serve during World War II, 
James proposed to Gertrude ‘‘Trudy’’ Mitchell. 
She would not accept at the time but told him 
she would wait for him. They were married in 
1945 and had 77 years of marriage together 
when she passed away on July 28, 2022. A 
member of James’ family said James and 
Trudy were one of the greatest love stories. 
Following his military service, James worked 
at Kroger and then GE until his retirement. He 
also wanted to showcase the beauty of our 
Commonwealth, so he used his artistic talents 
to paint scenes of Kentucky, reminding us 
Kentuckians of the deep pride we have for our 
home. 
I join the Owensboro community and James’ 
family and friends in wishing James a happy 
104th birthday and thank him for all he has 
done to serve our country and make Kentucky 
shine through his artwork.

selfless man who uplifted the voices of those 
in need and who was committed to the notion 
of bettering the life of others. 
Born on June 30, 1962 in Saigon, Vietnam, 
Tuan was the son of Nhan Le and Hoa 
Duong. Tuan emigrated with his family to the 
U.S. in 1975 after the fall of Saigon and set-
tled in Southern California. As a stranger in a 
strange land, Tuan learned to adapt to his 
new home and country. He graduated high 
school and enrolled in Cal Poly where he 
earned his Bachelor of Arts degree. A family 
man, Tuan was born as the fourth child in the 
household of seven siblings and was no 
stranger to family ‘‘comedy’’ and ‘‘drama.’’ He 
remained unfazed by life-altering events sur-
rounding him. He loved good food and good 
parties. Above all, he was a selfless man who 
was always available to lend a sympathetic 
ear to anyone who needed it. 
Tuan was a jack of many trades. While in 
school, he worked in various stores where he 
liked their merchandises in order to get the 
employee’s discount. After college, he ran a 
law office with his brother Kenny and then 
tried out his luck as an office manager for a 
dental office in Northern California. He went 
back to Vietnam and lived there for a while to 
reconnect with his roots. While there, he man-
aged and owned several businesses as well 
as dabbled in the entertainment industry. 
His compassion was boundless. By nature, 
his advocacy led to leadership and support for 
organizations such as GAPSN, GVA and 
VROC. Wherever he lived, he created a sup-
port network for young LGBTQ+ individuals 
struggling with life challenges. He provided 
emotional support, shelters or food to espe-
cially LGBTQ+ youths of color. No matter your 
ethnic background, if someone refers you to 
Tuan, he would find ways to assist you. He 
generously gave times to family and friends, 
consoled those in time of needs and partici-
pated or organized charity events serving the 
vulnerable children and the poor and disabled 
elderly in Vietnam. There were many facets of 
Tuan that we came to know and each piece 
of him made up the person we all trust, love 
and respect. 
Beside his father, Tuan was predeceased 
by his brother Duc Le. He is survived by his 
mother, lifelong partner Ngo Duc Anh, siblings 
and many nieces and nephews. I ask my col-
leagues to join me in recognizing this distin-
guished man and all the hard work he has 
done for the betterment of his community. 
I thank Tuan for the lifelong dedication he 
has demonstrated in helping others.

HONORING JANELL EDWARDS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a trailblazer and 
the receiver of the 2022 Remarkable Woman 
Award, Mrs. Janell Edwards. Mrs. Edwards 
has shown what can be done through hard 
work, dedication, and determination. 
Mrs. Janell Edwards moved from Savannah, 
Georgia to Fayette, Mississippi, in 2006. For 
over a decade, she has been the force behind 
the non-profit, Fayette Community Organiza-
tion. Due to the COVID–19 pandemic, and halt 
to many of her programs, she decided to tum 
her focus and pour her energy into helping the 
community economically. 
Mrs. Edwards and her husband are known 
in their community for their pecan trees. They 
pick pecans and sell them to a vendor in 
Natchez, MS. To help their neighbors, adults 
and children make money in Fayette, MS, they 
began purchasing the pecans from them. Be-
cause many of the trees are native, the Mis-
sissippi Extension Service was helpful in com-
ing out to share with the community on how to 
care for their trees during the year, so that 
they could get the most potential yield during 
pecan season. This was truly a great start to 
broaden the horizon for Fayette, MS. 
Mrs. Edwards is a member of Delta Sigma 
Theta, Inc. She is no stranger to leading and 
being a part of organizations that help make a 
change. She was born a leader and holds the 
capability to mobilize others towards action. 
She attended Savannah State College, where 
she was engaged in several organizations; 
leading and supervised many activities and 
was the overseer for many projects. 
With all the work Mrs. Edwards has done 
and doing, she has been recognized and re-
ceived several awards. Some of them include 
the Outstanding Community Service Award in 
2014, Inaugural Award of Rural Campions in 
2014, and Nominated for the 4th Annual Gulf 
Coast Gospel Music Awards in the category: 
Radio Personality of the Year Kingdom 
Influencer in 2020, just to name a few. Mrs. 
Edwards was also the host of the Annual FAT 
to FIT Event in Fayette, MS, in 2011, aver-
aging 500 attendees per day and she is cur-
rently working to make it an ongoing and larg-
er event on a local and national level. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Janell Edwards for her 
outstanding service and leadership in Fayette, 
MS.

TRIBUTE TO DR. ROSE WILDER 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a trailblazing educator 
and a good friend, Dr. Rose Ann Davis Hilliard 
Wilder, who transitioned on August 30, 2022 
after a valiant battle with cancer. Her impact 
on the State of South Carolina will be felt for 
generations to come. 
Born Rose Ann Davis on November 4, 
1955, in Santee, South Carolina, Dr. Wilder 
was a daughter of the late Laco and Ruby 
Mae Fogle Davis. 
From a young age, Dr. Wilder was pas-
sionate about education. It led her to earn an 
undergraduate degree in guidance and coun-
seling, a master’s in special education, and a 
PhD in education administration. 
Dr. Wilder began her teaching career in 
1979, and 8 years later she became assistant 
principal at Manning Primary School in 
Clarendon County. She went on to serve as 
the first principal of the new Manning Elemen-
tary School and later returned as principal of 
Manning Primary. 
In 1994, Dr. Wilder was appointed assistant 
superintendent of instruction for Clarendon 
School District 2. Later that year, she was 
chosen to lead the school district and made 
history by becoming the first African American 
female superintendent in South Carolina since 
the Reconstruction era. She served in that ca-
pacity for seven years, and in 1999, was 
named Outstanding Superintendent by the 
South Carolina School Board Association. 
She left Clarendon County to serve as su-
perintendent for the Fairfield County School 
District, but in 2004 returned to Clarendon 
County 
to 
serve 
as 
superintendent 
of 
Clarendon School District 1 in the Summerton 
area. While there, Dr. Wilder was recognized 
as the South Carolina Superintendent of the 
Year in 2014. 
She retired in 2017, and became Director of 
Teaching Education at Morris College. In 
2018, South Carolina Superintendent of Edu-
cation Molly Spearman named her the Super-
intendent of Williamsburg County School Dis-
trict where she led the district under the super-
vision of the state department until her pass-
ing. 
Dr. Wilder was an active member of several 
professional 
organizations 
and 
previously 
served as President of the South Carolina As-
sociation of School Administrators. In 1999 
and 2020, the South Carolina General Assem-
bly passed resolutions commending Dr. Wilder 
for her outstanding service in education. 
In 2020, the Clarendon School District 1 
Board of Trustees voted to officially rename 
St. Paul Elementary School the Dr. Rose H. 
Wilder Elementary School after receiving over-
whelming community support to rename the 
school in Dr. Wilder’s honor. 
She was married to Dr. James C. Wilder, 
and they shared three children, Warren La-
mont Wilder (deceased), Sharon Hilliard Hor-
ace, and Michelle Wilder Bedford. They also 
shared two grandchildren, Jaleah Wilder and 
Blake McKinely Horace. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to rise to celebrate the life and legacy 
of Dr. Rose Wilder. This remarkable woman 
helped shape the education and future of 
countless children throughout her career. They 
were her passion and her purpose, and she 
left no stone unturned in her determination to 
educate future generations and improve their 
quality of life. This giant and lifelong educator 
will be sorely missed.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
JOHN CRUTCHFIELD 
HON. JOHN R. CARTER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I’m honored to celebrate and recognize the 
extraordinary work of John Crutchfield. His 
eighteen years dedication to his beloved city 
of Killeen are the reflection of a true and de-
voted public servant. 
With his ‘‘can-do’’ spirit and high-minded vi-
sion, John is a trusted community leader. He 
brought his tremendous work ethic and com-
mitment to excellence to every challenge he 
encountered. 
As President/CEO of the Greater Killeen 
Chamber of Commerce, John won numerous 
awards 
and 
spearheaded 
many 
critical 
projects over the decades such as Texas A&M 
University Central, Interstate 14, business re-
cruitment, the research park, as well as pro-
tecting and growing Fort Hood. He also had a 
part in setting up the Fort Hood Regional Eco-
nomic Development Foundation. It’s public 
servants like him that make Killeen the wel-
coming, successful city that it is. 
While John isn’t tired of the privilege of pub-
lic service he knows that everything has its 
season and the time has come to allow the 
next generation of leaders to take the stage. 
Stepping away from his office won’t give him 
much idle time as he remains a vital part of 
the Central Texas community and will spend 
more time with his beloved wife Sheila and 
their family. 
Retirement is meant to be celebrated and 
enjoyed. It is not the end of a career, but the 
beginning of a new adventure. It is my honor 
to recognize the selfless service of John 
Crutchfield as he starts this new chapter of his 
life. On behalf of Central Texas, I thank him 
for his superb work and wish him the very 
best.

HONORING RUBIE HANKS-BUCK 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
person, Rubie Hanks-Buck. 
Rubie Hanks was born in Crenshaw, MS. 
She is the third of seven children (three boys 
and four girls). She is a 1970 graduate of 
Quitman County High School (now Madison S. 
Palmer High) in Marks, MS. After high school, 
she worked for a year at her church teaching 
illiterate adults to write their names and basic 
math. She later attended Coahoma Commu-
nity College majoring in Vocational Business. 
She is married to Willie James Buck, and 
they are the proud parents of three girls (Patri-
cia, Andrea, and Kyndall) and two grand-
children (Jordan and Tru). 
Mrs. Buck is a member of Holly Grove Mis-
sionary Baptist Church, where she serves in 
various capacities. She promotes healthy liv-
ing and eating by educating church members 
and others about the importance of knowing 
and controlling their blood pressure. 
Mrs. Buck worked for 40 years in the 
Quitman County School District as a Secretary 
and later as Payroll Clerk until her retirement 
in 2014. 
She’s active in her hometown of Crenshaw, 
where she serves as Chairperson of the An-
nual Christmas Parade Activities, and she has 
held this position for over 5 years. Mrs. Buck 
is Treasurer of the Les Grandes Soeurs Social 
Club in Quitman County, where they work with 
churches, organizations, schools, and local 
communities to improve the lives of the youths 
and elderly through scholarships and dona-
tions. 
Her legacy is more important than simply 
earning a salary but to live in peace and strive 
to make each day better than the one before.

HON. CONNIE CONWAY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Margaret ‘‘Megan’’ 
Michael Debranski Kelhart. Born on December 
2, 1975, in Norfolk, Virginia, Megan peacefully 
entered the arms of our Lord on August 19, 
2022. She was a proud and passionate moth-
er, charismatic leader, staunch advocate of 
public service, and a resolute supporter of cru-
cial public institutions and community mem-
bers in need. 
In 1994, Megan graduated from Lakeland 
High School, where she was an outstanding 
student and a standout tennis player on the 
State Champion Tennis Team. She was also 
a cheerleader, school band member, and 
prom queen. Megan later studied political 
science at Virginia Tech, where she was an 
active member of the Alpha Chi Omega soror-
ity, and went on to earn her Master of Science 
degree in natural resources. 
In 2001, while working in the United States 
Senate, Megan met her husband Matthew 
while playing in the Senate summer softball 
league. The pair married on October 25. 2003, 
and spent the next 18 and a half years trav-
eling the world together, sharing a love of col-
lege football, European travel and culture, and 
Italian wine. 
In 2009, Megan and her husband welcomed 
their son, Matteson Michael Donnan Kelhart. 
Matteson was Megan’s world—while Megan 
was a tireless professional and truly remark-
able friend and wife, it was as a mother that 
her grace and selflessness were most promi-
nently 
displayed. 
Megan 
passed 
on 
to 
Matteson her passion for reading, her fanatical 
dedication to her Virginia Tech Hokies, her 
love of travel, and her unwavering loyalty and 
integrity. 
Megan, who selflessly answered a call to 
service at the United States Senate, United 
States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bu-
reau of Reclamation, worked with nearly every 
congressional office. This body owes a debt of 
gratitude to her passion for policy and her 
unyielding dedication to public service. 
She is survived by her loving husband Mat-
thew Joseph Kelhart; their son, Matteson; her 
parents, Dr. Michael Debranski and Margaret 
Debranski of Suffolk, VA; her grandmother 
Margaret Beamon of Suffolk, VA; her father-in- 
law and his wife, Joseph and Lily Kelhart of 
Bethlehem, PA; her mother-in-law and her 
husband, Terri and Joseph Costa of Perkasie, 
PA; and other loved ones. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Margaret ‘‘Megan’’ 
Michael Debranski Kelhart. Her service and 
contributions to the Department of the Interior 
and the United States Congress will long be 
remembered.

the team to the NCAA Tournament three 
times. She received Kodak AH-American hon-
ors, among other accolades, and upon grad-
uation, entered the Women’s National Basket-
ball Association 
(WNBA) draft in 2007. 
Armintie played for nine seasons, and four 
season overseas from 2007 to 2015.

Dream in 2009, and the team earned spots in 
the finals every year. She also became an as-
sistant coach for the Ole Miss Lady Rebels; a

RECOGNIZING ANA M. FIGUEROA 
ON 
HER 
RETIREMENT 
AFTER 
THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF PUBLIC 
SERVICE 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and congratulate Ana 
M. Figueroa, my District Chief of Staff who re-
tired on March 4, 2022, after almost 30 years 
on my district staff. It also gives me great 
pleasure to help her celebrate her 53rd birth-
day today, September 14, 2022. 
Ana is a proud Mexican immigrant born in 
the town of Cueramaro, Guanajuato. Her par-
ents, Jose Dolores Figueroa and Consuelo 
Figueroa Laguna, immigrated to the United 
States with two of Ana’s four siblings, 
Rigoberto, and Rosa Maria, in 1974 and set-
tled in the Los Angeles area. Ana and her 
older sister, Maria Guadalupe, joined the fam-
ily in Los Angeles one year later, reuniting the 
7-member family which now included Ana’s 
youngest sister, Maricela. 
Ms. Figueroa grew up in Boyle Heights and 
the unincorporated East Los Angeles commu-
nity. She attended Lorena Street Elementary 
School, Rowan Avenue Elementary School, 
Robert L. Stevenson Jr. High School and 
graduated from James A. Garfield High School 
in 1987. The proud Bulldog graduate then at-
tended Occidental College where she majored 
in Cognitive Science and minored in Soci-
ology. 
Upon college graduation, Ana began her 
public service career with the office of Los An-
geles Mayor Tom Bradley as the assistant to 
his Liaison to the Latino Community and 
Eastside Area Coordinator in 1991. 
In July 1992, Ana was recruited by my Cali-
fornia State Assembly office to serve as a field 
representative for Southeast Los Angeles cit-
ies, Boyle Heights, and East Los Angeles in 
the 56th Assembly District. She was then pro-
moted to field deputy when I was elected to 
represent the 33rd Congressional District in 
January 1993. She became Senior Field Dep-
uty and Casework Director in June 1995, and 
my District Chief of Staff in May 1998. 
Ana earned the respect and gratitude of 
staff, colleagues, and elected officials at the 
congressional, state, and local levels as a re-
sult of her effectiveness, collaborative leader-
ship, unwavering commitment to community 
service, and outstanding dedication. 
With impeccable integrity, compassion, and 
distinction, she served the constituents of the 
33rd, 34th, and 40th Congressional Districts I 
represented through the years as the first 
Mexican American woman elected to the U.S. 
Congress. 
Ana officially retired from the U.S. House of 
Representatives on March 4, 2022, after al-
most 30 years as a member of my district of-
fice team. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing and thanking Ana M. 
Figueroa for her 31 years as an exemplary 
public servant and extending sincere best 
wishes for a healthy, prosperous, and richly 
rewarding retirement, and a very happy 53rd 
birthday.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a bright and vi-

dedication, and a desire to help. 
Terrionna Wilson is a senior at Warren Cen-
tral High School in Vicksburg, MS. Terrionna

HONORING THE LIFE OF SHELBY 
JACOBS 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the remarkable life of 
Shelby Jacobs, who passed away on Monday 
September 5, 2022, in Oceanside, California. 
Mr. Jacobs is survived by his wife Elizabeth 
Portillo-Jacobs, his daughter Shelley Modaff, 
and his granddaughter Shelby Beverly Jacobs. 
Due to his extraordinary contributions to the 
country and his life as a trailblazer, I selected 
Mr. Jacobs as my first Constituent of the 
Month on March 8, 2019. 
Born in Dallas, Texas, on April 27, 1935, 
Mr. Jacobs demonstrated an exceptional abil-
ity for math and science as well as a strong 
work ethic from an early age. After moving to 
California when he was eight, Mr. Jacobs 
began working on farms and in restaurants to 
help support his family before going on to 
study engineering. 
For 40 years, Mr. Jacobs worked on 
NASA’s Apollo and Space Shuttle programs, 
serving as the project manager of the Apollo- 
Soyuz orbiter and designer of the camera that 
captured the iconic 1968 Apollo 6 rocket sepa-
ration. 
As an African American working in an indus-
try with few people of color, Mr. Jacobs often 
faced discrimination and was overlooked for 
his contributions. While employed by the 
Rocketdyne division of North American Avia-
tion, he was one of eight African Americans 
out of 5,000 engineers at that time. Despite 
the barriers he faced, Mr. Jacobs went on to 
be a role model to younger generations, push-
ing for equality and progress throughout his 
life. 
In 2008, Mr. Jacobs was officially recog-
nized by NASA as one of the space program’s 
‘‘Unsung Heroes’’ and he is remembered as 
one of the ‘‘Hidden Figures.’’ Additionally, his 
work was highlighted in the Columbia Memo-
rial Space Center’s ‘‘Achieving the Impossible’’ 
exhibit. 
Mr. Jacobs moved to Oceanside in 1996 
with his family and quickly became an active 
member of the community, sharing his knowl-
edge and unique life story with his neighbors 
and the public. 
Madam Speaker, it has been an honor to 
celebrate Shelby Jacobs’ remarkable life and 
his legacy which continues to inspire.

est citizens, who’s grandparents and mother 
hail from the 11th Congressional District of 
Georgia. Shepherd Marshall Sims was born

Tennessee. Shepherd was a healthy 8 pounds 
8 ounces at birth. 
Shepherd is the brother of Wyndsor Anne 
Sims, age two, and is the son of Patrick Nich-
olas and Lauren Alexis Sims. The very proud 
grandparents are Beverly Ann Sims, and Ger-
ald and Tonya Veitch. 
Please join me in celebrating this joyous oc-
casion with my friends.

OVARIAN CANCER AWARENESS 
MONTH 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
during Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month to 
recognize women who have been diagnosed 
with ovarian cancer and have either survived 
or unfortunately lost their hard-fought battle. A 
rare but deadly disease, only approximately 
19,880 women will receive a new diagnosis 
this year—this past March, our Communica-
tions Director Danielle Jensen was one of 
them. 
The deadliest of the reproductive cancers, 
only 20 percent are diagnosed early in Stages 
I or II, with a five-year survival rate of over 93 
percent. Unfortunately, the majority of cases 
are diagnosed in Stages Ill or IV, when the 
survival rate can be as low as 30 percent. The 
risk of a woman getting ovarian cancer is 
about 1 in 78 in her lifetime and it is estimated 
that 12,810 women will lose their lives to ovar-
ian cancer this year. Fortunately, Danielle was 
diagnosed as Stage II and recently completed 
chemotherapy. 
There are several factors that can increase 
the risk of ovarian cancers. Age is the biggest 
one. Half of all ovarian cancers are found in 
women 63 years of age and older. Another is 
if a woman has never carried a pregnancy to 
full-term or had a child after the age of 35. 
Hormone replacement therapy, a family history 
of ovarian, breast or colorectal cancer, or a 
personal history of breast cancer are also risk 
factors. 
There is no reliable screening or diagnostic 
test for ovarian cancer, and it cannot be de-
tected during a pap smear, so it is important 
to know the signs and symptoms. This in-
cludes back pain, bloating, frequent urination, 
feeling full quickly after eating, fatigue, upset 
stomach-heartburn-or constipation, pelvic or 
abdominal pain, or changes in menstrual cy-
cles. While these symptoms are most likely 
not signs of cancer, they should be of concern 
if they don’t go away after two weeks following 
normal interventions such as changing diet 
and exercise, laxatives, or rest. It is because 
of this that ovarian cancer is often referred to 
as ‘‘the silent killer.’’ 
There are different treatments for ovarian 
cancer. Danielle had surgery and she went 
through six cycles of chemotherapy to kill any 
cancer cells that may have been left. Some 
women will also undergo radiation to treat it. 
What can lower the risk of ovarian cancer? 
Women who have been pregnant and carried 
to term before the age of 26, and each full- 
term pregnancy lowers the risk. Some studies 
show that breastfeeding may lower the risk 
even further, as well as using birth control 
pills. 
Finally, we are thankful that Danielle was di-
agnosed when she was and is on the path to 
being a survivor. She said she credits God 
and her faith for keeping her motivation fo-
cused and strong, as well as her medical team 
at Estabrook Cancer Center, including Dr. 
Crotzer, her nurse navigator Emily and PA 
Lorna, and her infusion nurse Abbey. She also 
thanks her family, including her mom who 
went to every appointment and her daughter 
who would check in on Danielle when she 
heard her crying from the pain, and her friends 
who supported her every day.

RECOGNIZING 
GEORGE 
GRAHAM 
FOR HIS 50 YEARS OF SERVICE 
TO WVIA FM 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor George Graham for his 50 years at 
WVIA FM, our region’s NPR affiliate. George 
was celebrated by his colleagues, family, and 
friends on August 29, 2022, for his service to 
our region and public radio. 
George was born and raised in Carbondale, 
Pennsylvania. After high school, he enrolled at 
Duke University to study electrical engineer-
ing. During his time at Duke, he served as the 
program director of the student radio station, 
bringing eclectic, contemporary music radio 
programming to the Durham, North Carolina- 
based university. 
After graduating magna cum laude in 1972, 
George returned to Northeastern Pennsylvania 
where he was hired as the first employee of 
WVIA Radio to do studio design and construc-
tion for WVIA-FM. With his impressive back-
ground of on-air work at Duke, he soon found 
himself with a regular on-air spot. 
While on the air, he introduced his popular 
show Mixed Bag which has become the long-
est, continuously running album adult alter-
native program in the country. The show fea-
tures weekly album reviews, new release seg-
ments, and a Friday night request show. In 
1976, he started Homegrown Music to high-
light regional artists from a variety of genres 
including rock, folk, bluegrass, jazz, blues, and 
World Music. Performances have been held in 
the studio weekly with a monthly concert for a 
live studio audience. George also hosts All 
That Jazz, which also highlights and provides 
live radio coverage of regional jazz festivals 
from the Delaware Water Gap and Scranton. 
When WVIA acquired Chiaroscuro Records, 
a 50-year-old jazz label, in 2010, George was 
appointed the director of artistry and rep-
ertoire, overseeing the extensive archive and 
production of new recordings and reissues. 
With his impressive background in the indus-
try, he has written for many regional publica-
tions and lends his time and expertise as a

FLORIDA’S 16TH CONGRESSIONAL 
DISTRICT 
FIRE

RESCUE 
EMS AWARDS 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize fire, rescue and EMS per-
sonnel who have provided distinguished serv-
ice to the people of Florida’s 16th Congres-
sional District. 
First responders, fire departments and 
emergency medical service teams are sum-
moned on short notice to serve their respec-
tive communities. Often times, they arrive at 
scenes of great adversity and trauma, to 
which 
they 
reliably 
bring 
strength 
and 
composure. These brave men and women 
spend hundreds of hours in training so that 
they are prepared when they get ‘‘the call.’’ 
Ten years ago, I established the 16th Dis-
trict Congressional Fire and Rescue and EMS 
Awards to honor officers, departments, and 
units for outstanding achievement. 
On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th 
District, it is my privilege to congratulate the

CELEBRATING 
THE 
150TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE GREENBACK 
VALLEY RANCH 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the 150th anniversary of the 
Greenback Valley Ranch, owned and operated 
by Bill and Penny Conway in the Sierra Ancha 
Mountains 14 miles to the east of Tonto Basin, 
Arizona. The valley derives its name from a 
Confederate greenback found by an army cap-
tain in an Indian camp in 1865. 
The ranch was founded by pig-farmer David 
Harer in 1872. Harer originally came from 
California and was looking for land to raise his 
pigs. When scouting for a possible site, Harer 
encountered an Apache Indian camp and de-
cided to approach with a rattlesnake on his 
back. After allowing the snake to bite him, he 
earned the Indians’ respect for this impressive 
feat to challenge and defeat death. He never 
told them that he defanged the snake. 
Harer’s bravery and resilience has been 
passed on to five generations of ranchers. His 
daughter married Edward Conway, and the 
Conways have immersed themselves in cattle 
ranching since the end of the 19th century 
with no plans to stop. 
Bill Conway has been working on the ranch 
for nearly 50 years and married Penny in 
1979. His family is an embodiment of the 
American spirit that hard, honest work and 
openness to life will yield ‘‘fruit that will last.’’ 
I pray that the Greenback Valley Ranch will 
continue to provide for the material and spir-
itual needs of the Conways and the commu-
nity for at least another 150 years to come.

CONSTITUTION 
WEEK AND THE DAUGHTERS OF 
THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION 
HON. TOM RICE 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Constitution Week 
and the Theodosia Burr Chapter of the Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution in Myrtle 
Beach, South Carolina. 
It is a privilege and duty of the American 
people to commemorate the two hundred thir-
ty-third anniversary of the drafting of the Con-
stitution of the United States of America by the 
Constitutional Convention. As citizens of this 
great nation, we must reaffirm the ideals the 
Framers of the Constitution had in 1787. 
Public Law 915 guarantees the issuing of a 
proclamation each year by the President of 
the Unites States of America designating Sep-
tember 17 through 23 as Constitution Week. It 
is fitting and proper to officially recognize this 
magnificent document and the anniversary of 
its creation. 
Madam Speaker, I join the Theodosia Burr 
Chapter of the Daughters of the American 
Revolution and the American people in recog-
nizing September 17 through September 23, 
2022 as Constitution Week and honor the 
Framers for their contributions.

NITY 
COLLEGE 
BOARD 
OF 
TRUSTEES 
HON. ELISSA SLOTKIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, September 14, 2022 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the dedicated leadership of an 
outstanding institution of higher education in 
Michigan’s 8th Congressional district: the 
Board of Trustees of Lansing Community Col-
lege. 
Founded in 1957, the trustees of Lansing 
Community College have guided the school 
through years of growth, change, and most re-
cently, a global pandemic. Through it all, they 
have maintained a forward-looking focus, and 
recently their efforts in the area of educational 
equity have been recognized on a national 
scale. 
While some organizations may talk the talk 
when it comes to addressing issues of equity, 
Lansing Community College truly walks the 
walk. The school’s diversity, equity, and inclu-
sion efforts are embedded throughout oper-
ations at the college, including at the board 
level and as part of the college’s formal stra-
tegic plan. In 2020, the LCC Board of Trust-
ees penned a resolution that specifically ad-
dressed racial injustice. resulting in the devel-
opment and implementation of a collegewide 
Equity Action Plan. 
For these and many other reasons, the 
Board of Trustees of Lansing Community Col-
lege has been named the recipient of the 
2022 Charles Kennedy Equity Award from the 
Association of Community College Trustees. 
This prestigious award honors their exemplary 
commitment as a governing board to the 
achievement of equity in the college’s edu-
cation programs and services, and in their ad-
ministration and delivery. 
Diversity brings with it a number of edu-
cational benefits, including improved racial and 
cultural awareness, enhanced critical thinking, 
higher levels of service to community, and a 
more educated citizenry, to name a few. How-
ever, other components—namely, equity and 
inclusion—are essential to delivering on diver-
sity’s promise to higher education more broad-
ly. I am thankful for the dedication the Board 
of Trustees of Lansing Community College 
brings to this vision and this mission, and it is 
my great honor to officially recognize their ac-
complishments.
