WHO PAYS FOR THE WOKE? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, dur-
ing the Trump administration, Repub-
licans passed one of the biggest tax 
cuts in American history and the larg-
est regulatory relief ever. Together, 
they produced the biggest economic ex-
pansion in our lifetimes. 
Before the lockdown left took a 
wrecking ball to our economy, Ameri-
cans were prospering with the lowest 
unemployment rate in 50 years, the 
lowest poverty rate in 60 years, and the 
fastest wage growth in 40 years. For 
the first time in decades, the income 
gap was narrowing. 
Well, Joe Biden and the Democrats 
have reversed these policies with reck-
less abandon, and it is no coincidence 
that real wages for Americans have de-
clined every single month since he 
took office. 
History is crystal clear on this point: 
No country has ever taxed, spent, and 
borrowed its way to prosperity, but 
many have done so to their ruin. 
Brian Riedl tallied up the total cost 
of the Democrats’ new spending bills 
for the New York Post today and esti-
mates $8 trillion over the next 10 years, 
more than $60,000 per family. Joe Biden 
and the Democrats tell us it won’t cost 
you a penny. It will all be paid by 
somebody else. 
But here is the dirty little secret of 
government 
spending. 
Government 
cannot put a dollar into the economy 
that it hasn’t first taken out of the 
same economy. Every dollar it gives to 
you, it must take from you, and there 
are only three ways to do that: through 
current taxes, which rob you of your 
current purchasing power; through bor-
rowing, which robs you of your future 
purchasing 
power; 
or 
by 
printing 
money, which robs you every time you 
go shopping by reducing the value of 
your earnings, while it silently hollows 
out your savings and retirement funds. 
Don’t fall for their lie that their 
taxes will only fall on businesses. Busi-
nesses don’t pay business taxes; you 
pay business taxes. You pay them as a 
consumer through higher prices; you 
pay them as an employee through 
lower wages; and you pay them as an 
investor through lower earnings. That 
is your retirement fund. 
You know they are coming after 
working families because they want to 
hire 87,000 new IRS agents—87,000 new 
IRS agents. That is every man, woman, 
and child living today in Miami Beach, 
Florida, or Ogden, Utah. Imagine the 
entire population of one of those cities 
hired to go after every taxpayer in 
America. 
And get this: The Democrats’ so- 
called American Families Plan will re-
quire your bank to report every one of 
your private transactions over $600 to 
the IRS—every transaction you make 
over $600 automatically reported to the 
IRS. 
Does that sound like they are coming 
after the Biden family? No, they are 
coming after your family. 
If you are typical, you already paid 
more in taxes last year than you paid 
for food, clothing, healthcare, and en-
tertainment combined. Yet, according 
to the Democrats, that is just not 
enough. 
What else do you get for your $60,000 
of new taxes and inflation and tax-driv-
en price increases? Well, you get am-
nesty, legal permanent residence, and a 
fast track for citizenship for 8 to 10 
million foreign nationals who illegally 
entered our country and demand to 
stay. 
Now, let’s just take the lower num-
ber, 8 million. That is the entire popu-
lation of Wyoming, Alaska, Vermont, 
South Dakota, North Dakota, Rhode 
Island, 
Montana, 
and 
Maine 
com-
bined—this at a time when real family 
earnings are declining, crime is in-
creasing, homelessness is rampant, and 
mounting debt is killing the American 
Dream of a better future for our chil-
dren. 
Explain to me how American workers 
are helped by flooding the labor mar-
ket with low-wage labor. 
Of course, the woke ruling class 
makes out very well. That $60,000 
taken from your earnings over the next 
decade will, for example, pay bonuses 
of up to $50,000 each for reporters and 
bloggers across the country who so 
shamelessly do the Democrats’ bidding.

League universities and the fashion-
able elite who buy $82,000 Teslas. 
There is even a new civilian climate 
corps, presumably filled with officious 
little climate pioneers ever eager to re-
port whose chimney is smoking, who is 
watering the lawn on the wrong day, 
and who is spreading forbidden climate 
disinformation. 
It is easy to make fun of all this 
until you realize this is about to be-
come law. America, for God’s sake, 
wake up. Our country is on the preci-
pice. 
I have just one question for my 
Democratic colleagues: What makes 
you think socialism will work any bet-
ter here than everywhere else it has 
been tried?

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CORPORAL HUNTER LOPEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Marine Corps Corporal Hunter 
Lopez, my constituent, who was killed 
in action on August 26, 2021, while serv-
ing our Nation in Afghanistan. 
Today, I humbly rise to honor his 
memory in the hope that Americans 
across the country and future genera-
tions will come to know his story. 
Corporal Lopez was a selfless young 
man with an infectious smile who truly 
lived his life with a larger purpose in 
mind. That purpose was serving our 
country and contributing to something 
greater than himself. 
He was born in Palm Springs, Cali-
fornia, on January 15, 1999. Growing up 
in Indio, he possessed a passion for 
service from a young age. His parents, 
Herman and Alicia, both public serv-
ants with the Riverside County Sher-
iff’s Department, instilled in him the 
courage, kindness, and resolve that led 
him to join the Marine Corps. 
Corporal Lopez was a history buff, an 
ambitious student, and an avid Star 
Wars fan with an affinity for quizzing 
his friends and family on the movie se-
ries’ trivia. 
He was also incredibly thoughtful. He 
was the kind of person who would take 
the time, while serving overseas, to 
write letters to his grandparents in 
their native Spanish, despite not being 
fluent himself, just because he knew 
they would appreciate it. 
Corporal Lopez always strived for ex-
cellence, and his determination to suc-
ceed motivated his friends and those 
around him to reach their full poten-
tial. 
After graduating from La Quinta 
High School and achieving the rank of 
captain as an Explorer Scout with the 
Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, 
Corporal 
Lopez 
joined 
the 
Marine 
Corps, where he served for 4 years. 
His first 3 years were with the Fleet 
Antiterrorism Security Team Company 
A, 5th Platoon, before he joined the 2nd 
Battalion 1st Marine Division, Golf 
Company, 1st Platoon, 3rd Squad. 
It was with the 2nd Battalion that 
Corporal Lopez served in Operation Al-
lies Refuge, contributing to the largest 
airlift in history and aiding the evacu-
ation of over 120,000 of our fellow 
Americans, allies, and Afghan partners, 
a truly heroic and historic effort. 
On August 26, 2021, Corporal Lopez 
was stationed at the airport in Kabul. 
That day, under the blazing sun, Cor-
poral Lopez and his fellow marines 
worked tirelessly to evacuate the thou-
sands of women, children, and families 
who came to the airport desperately 
seeking safety, protection, and refuge. 
Striving to bring calm to a panicked 
crowd, Corporal Lopez put the safety of 
others above his own. As the crowd 
grew more intense, Corporal Lopez and 
his fellow marine, Sergeant David 
Traylor, 
spotted 
two 
young 
girls, 
trapped under the weight of a fleeing 
crowd, about to be crushed. 
The two marines successfully pulled 
the children to safety, saving their 
lives. They gave each other a fist 
bump, a very small celebration for an 
incredible task that they had just 
achieved. And then the explosion hap-
pened. 
That day, Corporal Lopez gave his 
life to save the lives of others. I can’t 
think 
of 
anything—anything—more 
noble than that. 
Corporal Lopez saved two lives at the 
Kabul airport, and because of him, two 
children now have a future and the 
promise of a new life, many others 
reached safety, and many others have a 
reason to hope. 
We lost Corporal Lopez and 12 other 
servicemembers on August 26. Each 
and every day since then, the Lopez 
family and the families of all our Na-
tion’s fallen heroes continue to feel 
their loss. They feel the loss of a loved 
one who made the ultimate sacrifice 
for our Nation, and they feel the loss of 
a hero who died serving a purpose larg-
er than themselves. 
To the Lopez family, parents, Her-
man and Alicia; sister, Trinity; and 
brother, Owen: You are in our constant 
prayers, and our entire Nation grieves 
your loss, stands with you, and sup-
ports you. 
We will continue to tell the story of 
Hunter’s remarkable service, compas-
sion, strength, and valor so that his 
legacy will live on for generations to 
come.

HEARTFELT 
CONDOLENCES 
TO 
FAMILY OF CORPORAL HUNTER 
LOPEZ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, to 
my colleague, my Democrat colleague: 
From west Texas, our heartfelt condo-
lences to Corporal Lopez and his family 
for that ultimate sacrifice. 
I am about to really launch into the 
debate over the tax-and-spend bill, but 
we stand united for our troops and for 
those who are willing to give up their 
tomorrow, or their today, so that we 
can have a future in this country. 
God bless the Lopez family, and I 
thank the gentleman for his remarks. 
CONGRATULATING WYLIE LITTLE LEAGUE 
BASEBALL TEAM 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate a few out-
standing members of the next genera-
tion of west Texans. 
The Wylie Little League baseball 
team from Abilene, Texas, represented 
not only District 19 well but the whole 
State of Texas in the Little League 
World Series there in Williamsport, 
Pennsylvania. 
This team knows what it is like to 
compete in true west Texas fashion. 
The success of this team is unprece-
dented, winning against teams from 
Washington, 
New 
Jersey, 
and 
Ne-
braska. 
To the Wylie All-Stars, their proud 
parents and coaches, and especially 
Manager Reggie Regala, west Texas is 
so proud of you, all of your achieve-
ments, and your outstanding represen-
tation of west Texas and Congressional 
District 19. Thank you. 
Go All-Stars. And God bless west 
Texas. 
A TAX ON EVERY AMERICAN 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, we 
are, as a Nation, looking down the bar-
rel of the largest tax-and-spend pro-
posal in the history of the United 
States, this while our Nation suffers 
from a recession and major runaway 
inflation on account of policies from 
my Democrat colleagues to sideline 
labor by paying people more to be on 
unemployment than to go to work. So 
you have labor sidelined, which dis-
torted supply and demand. 
You also had a bill that was $2 tril-
lion, with the flag of COVID relief 
wrapped around it, to bail out union 
pensions and blue States and blue cit-
ies that were broke before COVID ever 
hit our shores. This has created infla-
tion, a tax on every American. 
The answer from my Democrat col-
leagues is to tax the middle class, to 
chase jobs back overseas. After the tax 
cuts lifted 6 million people out of pov-
erty, gave us the largest wage increase 
in 20 years, the largest household in-
come increase on record, we want to 
tax our job creators. We want to load 
the working man and woman and fami-
lies with lower wages, with higher cost 
of goods and services. That is what the 
tax will translate into for these folks. 
This is not only the largest tax in-
crease; it is not only the largest spend-
ing boondoggle; it is the largest redis-
tribution of wealth, the largest expan-
sion of government, the most radical 
reimagination of our government’s role 
in the American people’s lives in the 
history of our country. I believe that. I 
don’t think that is hyperbole.

What are we taxing? To make Amer-
ica less competitive and to put more 
burden on the American people? To 
what end? To pay for the green new

disaster, in my humble opinion, their 
extreme environmental policies based 
on the premise that we will have an 
apocalyptic end of the Earth in 10 or 15 
years, trillions of dollars, while we 
cede economic leadership to the likes 
of China and Russia. We give them the 
keys to the kingdom, and we end up de-
faulting 
our 
energy 
independence, 
which is such an important part, not 
only of our economic prowess, but of 
our national security. We are racking 
up 
debt 
that 
is 
completely 
unsustainable. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill represents 
$27,000 per household on top of $200,000 
per household already of the $28 tril-
lion in debt. This bill will not be paid 
for. We continue to put a deferred tax 
on our grandchildren, and we rob them 
of their freedom and their future in 
this great country. All of this is be-
cause of an income inequality crisis or 
a climate crisis. Before, it was the 
COVID crisis. 
Let me tell you the crises the Amer-
ican people are concerned about: the 
chaos and lawlessness at the southern 
border, along the border of my home 
State. 
They are concerned about the run-
away inflation and the crisis of being 
able to make ends meet. 
They are concerned about the crisis 
of the debt that will be borne by their 
children and grandchildren. 
They are concerned about the sus-
tainability of the safety net for our 
seniors, Medicare and Social Security. 
Both are insolvent in less than 10 
years, and my Democrat colleagues 
didn’t spend a dime, not a dime, of the 
trillions of dollars, to make sure that 
wasn’t the case and that we could ful-
fill that promise. 
f 
IT IS TIME TO DELIVER 
INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today because, believe it or not, 
yet again, it is infrastructure week 
here. 
For decades, our country has been 
calling for investment to bring our in-
frastructure into, not just the future, 
but at this point, the present. 
For months, we have been meeting, 
both Democrats and Republicans, to 
get this bill to work for all of us. Now, 
it is time to take action and pass it for 
the American people. The stakes could 
not be higher. 
Nevada, where I am from, has been 
ground zero for this pandemic. We are 
ground zero for the effects of climate 
change. But, more importantly, we are 
ground zero for the promise and the 
economic opportunities in this bill. 
Roads, bridges, access to broadband, 
electric vehicles, electric buses, clean 
energy, water solutions for the West, 
all of this is needed and all of it will 
benefit my State and every corner in 
this country. That is why we have to 
put politics aside, come together, and 
pass this legislation now. 
I came to Congress because I was 
tired of the bickering and the dysfunc-
tion and the gridlock. I was tired of 
politics as usual. 
Safer roads and bridges, these are not 
partisan political issues. We have the 
opportunity to pass these investments 
for every single American and create 
millions 
of 
good-paying 
jobs 
and 
strengthen our recovery and get our 
economy back on track. The time to 
deliver solutions is now. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF RAY 
LARSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
to honor the life of a devoted public 
servant, Ray Larson of Lexington, Ken-
tucky. 
Ray served as assistant deputy attor-
ney general for the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky, but later, for 32 years, Ray 
was one of the most consequential 
Commonwealth’s 
attorneys 
in 
our 
great State’s history, dedicated to our 
community and the rule of law. 
He was an outstanding prosecutor, 
always 
laser 
focused 
on 
deterring 
crime, relentlessly pursuing justice, 
advocating for victims’ rights, and 
keeping 
central 
Kentucky 
families 
safe. 
Ray was an unapologetic and prin-
cipled fighter, leading by example and 
advancing the cause of law and order. 
He 
believed 
in 
defending, 
not 
defunding, the police. 
Ray was a faithful member of Good 
Shepherd Episcopal Church, where he 
served as a Eucharist minister and 
taught high school Sunday school for 
over 30 years. 
On a personal note, Ray was a dear 
friend and an important mentor to me. 
Mr. Speaker, Ray Larson was a great 
American patriot who made a positive 
difference, 
and 
he 
will 
be 
deeply 
missed. God bless him and his family, 
and I appreciate the opportunity to pay 
tribute to a great American. 
IRS FINANCIAL INSTITUTION REPORTING 
MANDATE 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in opposition to the Biden administra-
tion’s proposal to mandate banks, cred-
it unions, and other financial institu-
tions to report the inflows and out-
flows of customer bank accounts to the 
IRS. 
Think big government has too much 
of your personal data now? Just wait 
until the Biden administration and 
congressional Democrats require banks 
to submit the financial transactions of 
millions of Americans to the IRS. 
Let me repeat that. For the Ameri-
cans watching on C–SPAN right now, 
President Biden, as part of his massive 
job-killing tax increase, wants the IRS 
to have unfettered power to spy on 
your bank accounts, your deposits, 
your withdrawals, and your payments. 
While I was pleased to see that the 
Ways and Means Committee did not in-
clude this provision in their bill during 
markup, news reports suggest there are 
still negotiations with the administra-
tion for its inclusion. A higher account 
threshold or other minor policy shifts 
will not solve the fundamental flaws 
with this proposal. 
The mandatory reporting of Ameri-
cans’ transactions violates their pri-
vacy and puts an undue burden on fi-
nancial institutions that could cripple 
community banks that helped get gov-
ernment aid to struggling small busi-
nesses during the pandemic, and it is 
predicated on the Biden administra-
tion’s assumption that every American 
is somehow a tax cheat. How offensive. 
This is a disgusting example of Big 
Government 
overreach, 
and 
I 
am 
sounding the alarm. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to actively oppose this mis-
guided and dangerous proposal. 
IRRESPONSIBLE VOTE TO INCREASE THE DEBT 
CEILING WITHOUT FISCAL REFORMS 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
as a member of the House Financial 
Services Committee in strong opposi-
tion to the Democrats’ reckless and ir-
responsible vote to increase the debt 
ceiling without any fiscal reforms and 
provide a blank check for the Demo-
crats’ socialist tax and spending spree, 
which they intend to ram through Con-
gress later this week or in the coming 
weeks. 
Everybody understands we cannot de-
fault on our debt. But don’t let the 
Democrats and their allies in the 
media fool you. This debt limit in-
crease does not cover funds already 
spent. The ceiling suspended in 2019 ac-
commodated 100 percent of the spend-
ing under the previous administration, 
including five bipartisan COVID re-
sponse bills and then some. 
But Democrats chose to pass, on a 
partisan basis, $2 trillion in new spend-
ing, less than 10 percent of which actu-
ally responded to COVID, and that is 
what has brought us to this new debt 
limit. Republicans did not vote for that 
$2 trillion, and now President Biden 
and Democrats want an additional $5.5 
trillion, $4.3 trillion of which has zero 
Republican support. So it is Democrat 
partisanship that has resulted in a par-
tisan debt limit vote. 
Let’s be clear. This debt limit vote 
enables massive amounts of new spend-
ing, not old spending. Even with the 
largest tax increase in American his-
tory, a tax increase that would make 
the tax burden on American businesses 
higher than in communist China, this 
is a bill that will add at least $2.4 tril-
lion to the national debt, even with all 
of those new historic tax increases. 
And the hypocrisy of those who criti-
cize the job-producing and revenue-pro-
ducing Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, claim-
ing that it would massively increase 
the deficit, where are they now? The 
hypocrisy is breathtaking. These are 
the same people who support adding 
trillions to the national debt.

H5468 
September 28, 2021 
I came to Congress to save this coun-
try from bankruptcy, and I will not 
stand idly by as such dangerous legisla-
tion is pushed on a partisan basis 
through the Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, oppose this tax and 
spending spree. 
f 
IT IS TIME TO RAISE THE DEBT 
CEILING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, we 
have often turned to Lincoln. My good 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
have tried to be Lincolnesque, but I 
don’t think they have dug deep into 
the virtues of Abraham Lincoln. They 
didn’t delve deeply into his sense of 
courage and integrity. 
We know that his ultimate goal was 
to preserve the Union, as it should 
have been. He was, in fact, the Presi-
dent of the United States of America, 
not of the Union States, not of the 
Confederate States. But often as they 
pretend Lincolnesque, it is abandoned 
along the trash heap of highways of de-
spair. 
First of all, the Build Back Better 
Act is paid for over 10 years, in con-
trast to the debacle voted on, to a one, 
by my friends on the other side of the 
aisle, of the Trump tax cut, 83 percent 
for those who were already flourishing 
in dollars, while it left the bus drivers 
and teachers and paramedics, nurses 
and emergency room doctors, along the 
highway with tin cups. 
Any plan for embellishing, staffing— 
and that is what it is—for the Internal 
Revenue Service, of which we should 
continue to have oversight, is to ensure 
that those who have paid not a dime— 
not a dime—not a dime, Mr. Speaker— 
pay their fair share. 
Do you think any American is 
against that? I have seen Republicans, 
Democrats, and Independents who are 
crucially asking the question: Am I 
carrying the entire burden? 
My friends stand stalwart, the Re-
publicans; they are not going to raise 
the debt ceiling. First of all, it is the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States. Read the Constitution. It is to 
ensure that America’s bills, money al-
ready spent, are paid. 
Just like you use your electricity, 
you are paying ahead of time; you are 
paying for the bill already spent. The 
electricity, the light was on for 20 
days. You are paying for that light to 
be on. 
I am sad to say that there are so 
many who can’t make ends meet, can’t 
pay the light bill. I have heard it often. 
Can’t pay rent; can’t pay the water 
bill. 
So I am going to start with two icons 
from different eras about the word 
‘‘courage.’’ 
Abraham Lincoln eloquently spoke in 
1862—he was a most visionary writer— 
‘‘The dogmas of the quiet past are in-
adequate to the stormy present.’’ All 
that 
we 
talked 
about, 
all 
the 
contentiousness 
of 
yesteryear, 
you 
need to put it aside. ‘‘The occasion is 
piled high . . .’’—this day, this month, 
this 2021, this in the midst of a na-
tional health emergency, is piled high 
‘‘. . . with difficulty, and we must rise 
with the occasion. As our case is new, 
so must we think anew and act anew. 
We must disenthrall ourselves, and 
then we shall save our country.’’ 
Is anyone here willing to save their 
country? Are they willing to join as 
Americans to save the country? 
I know 2022 is coming. Great cam-
paign ads about what Democrats did. I 
am glad that my terminology will be 
what an American did by the name of 
SHEILA JACKSON LEE. What did she do? 
‘‘Courage is the most important of 
all the virtues because without courage 
you can’t practice any other virtue 
consistently,’’ said the iconic and late 
Maya Angelou, who I had the privilege 
of teaching me. What a great memory 
I have of her being my professor. 
So I want to speak this morning on 
the cruciality of moving forward on the 
INVEST Act and the Build Back Better 
Act. Without a doubt, I want to be able 
to not give short shrift to the 2 years of 
free pre-K and 2 years of free commu-
nity college, paid for, giving Americans 
the front-end and giving the oppor-
tunity to be able, for some, to be in 
college for the first time. They are 
moving on to historically Black col-
leges of their choice or other colleges 
of their choice. 
What about the Federal Medicaid 
program, when 12 States failed to opt 
in during the Affordable Care Act and 
left a trash heap of desperate people. 
Not the people desperate, but on the 
heap of despair, no healthcare, because 
they were below the threshold. Our 
friends as well decided not to do any-
thing. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, how important 
it is to have the INVEST Act, with 
making sure we have broadband and 
making sure that we have high-speed 
internet as well as highways that work 
not against us but for us. 
Let’s do the right thing and have the 
courage of Americans. Let’s stand for 
America.

CONGRATULATIONS TO ALAN 
JOHNSON 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize an individual 
from my district for his work to keep 
both Iowans and Americans healthy. 
Alan Johnson, a professor in the De-
partment of Psychological and Brain 
Sciences at the University of Iowa, has 
been selected for the 2021 Excellence 
Award for Hypertension Research by 
the 
American 
Heart 
Association’s 
Council on Hypertension. 
This award by the American Heart 
Association is given to members of the 
scientific community who have had a 
major impact in research that has con-
tributed to better understanding the 
causes and effects of hypertension. 
Hypertension, or high blood pressure, 
is a common cardiovascular condition 
that affects millions of Americans a 
year and is a major contributor of both 
strokes and heart attacks. 
I am proud of Professor Johnson for 
his decades of research into the effects, 
causes, and treatments of this condi-
tion, and I congratulate him for earn-
ing this prestigious award. 
THANK YOU TO STEAD FAMILY CHILDREN’S 
HOSPITAL STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
September is Childhood Cancer Aware-
ness Month, and I would like to take a 
moment to thank my district for their 
work in treating and researching child-
hood cancer. 
A staple to my district and to the 
Iowa City community is the University 
of Iowa Stead Family Children’s Hos-
pital, located right across the street 
from Kinnick Stadium. You all might 
know it well from the ‘‘wave,’’ one of 
college football’s greatest traditions. 
The Stead Family Children’s Hos-
pital specializes in treating pediatric 
patients, winning several awards for 
their specialties in not only pediatric 
cancer but also orthopedics and cardi-
ology, among others. 
Our gratitude for helping these chil-
dren extends beyond the staff of Stead 
Family Children’s Hospital. Many Uni-
versity of Iowa students and members 
of the Iowa City community use their 
free time to volunteer just to brighten 
a child’s day. 
Thank you to the men and women in 
Iowa who are working to treat and re-
search childhood cancer and to those 
who use their time to comfort children 
who are currently battling it, a disease 
no child or parent should face alone. 
HILLS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WINS AWARD 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to speak about the impor-
tance of childhood education and how a 
school in my district is taking extra 
strides to ensure their students’ suc-
cess. 
At Hills Elementary School in Hills, 
Iowa, one out of four students are in 
the process of learning English as their 
second language. This is far higher 
than the average rate in Iowa being 12 
percent. 
Though many might see this lan-
guage disparity as a barrier to student 
achievement, this year, Hills Elemen-
tary was selected as one of 325 schools 
to win a National Blue Ribbon School 
Award from the U.S. Department of 
Education, with 81 percent of students 
at the school showing improvement in 
their academics. 
Beginning in 1982, the National Blue 
Ribbon School Award has been used to 
recognize American schools for their 
academic excellence. 
I couldn’t be prouder of both the stu-
dents and faculty at Hills Elementary,

IMPROVING OUR 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to support the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act, a 
historic investment that will create 
millions of good-paying jobs and sup-
port America’s future global competi-
tiveness. 
This bill will do so much to repair 
our ailing infrastructure and will cre-
ate two million labor-friendly jobs 
each year for a decade. 
Florida has 408 bridges and more 
than 3,564 miles of highway that are in 
poor condition. 
Through this bill, Florida will re-
ceive $13 billion for federal-aid highway 
programs and $245 million for bridge re-
pair. 
Florida will also receive $2.6 billion 
for public transit systems and $1.2 bil-
lion for airport development. 
To further help us cut down on trans-
portation emissions, the bill will pro-
vide Florida with nearly $200 million to 
support the expansion of an electric ve-
hicle charging network. 
I have also heard, Mr. Speaker, from 
so many municipalities throughout 
south Florida who are struggling with 
obsolete water infrastructure. Thank-
fully, this bill provides Florida with 
$1.6 billion to get rid of lead pipes and 
improve water infrastructure. 
For Florida’s highways and byways, 
which are some of the most dangerous 
in the Nation, this legislation will 
usher in a ‘‘Safe Streets for All’’ pro-
gram to help reduce crashes and fatali-
ties. 
Also important for Florida, this bill 
provides the Army Corps of Engineers 
with $1.9 billion for aquatic ecosystem 
restoration projects. 
The Florida delegation expects the 
Corps to use a large portion of this 
money on Everglades restoration to 
bolster the funding we already secured 
through 
the 
regular 
appropriation 
process and get the project back on 
track. 
This bill is a big investment in sur-
face transportation and hard infra-
structure, but it is only a segment of 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda. 
I am looking forward to passing the 
revolutionary climate and resiliency 
programs in the Build Back Better Act. 
For my own constituents and the 
children and grandchildren of everyone 
in this Nation, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this important bill and the Build Back 
Better Act. That will allow us to truly 
rebuild our working class and set us on 
a path to prosperity. 
f 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize two Hispanic trail-
blazers in Omaha—Robert, known as 
Bob, Campos and Dr. James, known as 
Jim, Ramirez—for their generous con-
tributions to our community. 
After growing up together in the 
same 
working-class 
South 
Omaha 
neighborhood, Bob and Jim each went 
on to lead extraordinary, successful 
lives, and they have made a huge dif-
ference in our community. 
Bob Campos was born in 1938 to Mexi-
can 
immigrant 
parents 
in 
South 
Omaha, a neighborhood long regarded 
as a melting pot of multicultural im-
migrant families. Growing up, his large 
family shared only a one-bedroom 
home. So when Bob was only 8 years 
old, he went to work at the neighbor-
hood grocery store to earn some extra 
income for his family. 
At 16 years old, Campos dropped out 
of high school and attempted to enlist 
in the United States Marines but was 
unsuccessful after falsifying his age in 
his application. Shortly after that, he 
fulfilled his desire to serve his country 
by joining the U.S. Coast Guard. 
After his military service, Bob moved 
back to Omaha and worked at the 
Kiewit Construction Company. After 15 
years at Kiewit, he started his own 
business, 
Campos 
Construction, 
on 
January 1, 1977. Starting his business 
with only $500 and a pickup truck, 
Campos grew his company to become 
the largest minority-owned construc-
tion company in Nebraska. 
Bob’s reputation for excellence led 
him to take on high-profile projects, to 
include painting the home of President 
Abraham Lincoln in Illinois and build-
ing the Gerald R. Ford Conservation 
Center in Omaha. 
In 2003, Bob leased the land to build 
community soccer fields in South 
Omaha, personally mowing and tending 
to the property now known as the Bob 
Campos Soccer Complex. 
Bob also fosters educational leader-
ship opportunities for Hispanic high 
school students through the Grassroots 
Leadership Development Program. 
Dr. Jim Ramirez was born in 1934 to 
Mexican 
immigrant 
parents 
who 
worked in the meatpacking plants of 
South Omaha. 
During high school, Dr. Ramirez 
faced repeated discrimination and was 
told by guidance counselors and peers 
that Latinos such as himself did not 
belong in college. So after graduation, 
Jim joined his father at the Nebraska 
Beef packing plant, where arduous 
work motivated him to pursue higher 
education and a better life. 
For 18 years, Ramirez worked the 
slaughterhouse in the day and took 
classes at night; graduating in 1971 
with a bachelor’s degree in sociology 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Nebraska 
Omaha. He went on to earn his mas-
ter’s degree in guidance and counseling 
from UNO in 1974 and, ultimately, a 
Ph.D. in adult continuing education in 
1984. 
Having 
witnessed 
discrimination 
throughout his years as a student, Dr. 
Ramirez made it his life’s mission to 
promote pathways to higher education 
for Omaha’s Hispanic community. 
In 1972 Dr. Ramirez was selected to 
chair UNO’s Committee on Mexican- 
American Affairs, upon whose rec-
ommendation 
the 
University 
hired 
more Hispanic faculty, administrators, 
and staff. 
After earning his doctorate, Dr. Ra-
mirez was hired by UNO as a professor 
and counselor, where he spent decades 
mentoring countless Hispanic and mi-
nority students. 
Dr. Ramirez went on to work as a 
human relations specialist at Omaha 
Public Schools, where he recruited His-
panic teachers from across the country 
to teach and mentor Omaha’s Latino 
students. 
Additionally, today I would like to 
recognize the Latino Center of the Mid-
lands for celebrating 50 years of serving 
Omaha’s Hispanic community. 
The Latino Center is an education 
and social service nonprofit located in 
South Omaha, the heart of Omaha’s 
Latino community. 
Founded officially in 1971 as the Chi-
cano Awareness Center, their work is 
rooted in advocacy for and service to 
Omaha’s 
Latino 
community. 
Their 
three major programs, Family and 
Community Well-Being, Pathways to 
Success, and Workforce Education and 
Innovation impact over 2,500 individ-
uals and families a year. Currently it is 
led by Albert Varas. 
During Hispanic Heritage Month, no 
other two individuals and organization 
are deserving for our recognition than 
Bob Campos, Dr. Jim Ramirez, and the 
Latino Center. Together they dem-
onstrate for all Americans, especially 
Latino Americans, that through hard 
work, perseverance, and faith, any-
thing is possible. 
I am pleased to announce that Bob 
Campos, Dr. Jim Ramirez, and the 
Latino Center of the Midlands have 
been selected as the inaugural induct-
ees to the Nebraska Hispanic Hall of 
Fame, established this year by the Ne-
braska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce 
in collaboration with my office, where 
their stories and many others will be 
shared for centuries to come. 
Thank you, Bob and Jim, and the 
Latino Center, for making a difference 
in our great community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5470 
September 28, 2021 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of passing the his-
toric bipartisan infrastructure bill on 
Thursday. 
In August, all 220 House Democrats 
came here on the floor and voted to 
support opening debate and to vote on 
this once-in-a-century bipartisan infra-
structure bill this week. Why? Because 
America simply can’t afford to wait 
any longer. 
In New Jersey, our roads are the 
third worst in the Nation. One-third of 
our bridges are considered unsafe. Our 
transit has the worst on-time record in 
the country. Our train tunnel, which is 
critical between New York and New 
Jersey, 20 percent of the GDP runs 
through that corridor, yet the tunnel is 
113 years old and literally crumbling. 
Moms and dads wait hours in delays to 
get home every night. It is affecting 
our businesses and our productivity. 
Hurricane Ida and climate change de-
stroyed so many family homes in my 
community just weeks ago. 
The unfortunate reality is this: We 
just haven’t made the investments we 
need in this country in infrastructure. 
China last year spent $3.7 trillion 
outside of China on infrastructure, and 
yet here we are year in and year out 
calling for infrastructure week and to 
get it done, and nothing happens. Now 
is our opportunity to get something 
done for our country. 
This historic bill, $1.2 trillion, will 
turn that around and put two million 
hardworking men and women of labor 
to work every year for the next decade. 
It will invest in electric vehicle infra-
structure and the Gateway Tunnel, in 
rebuilding that. The tunnel I talked 
about that is crumbling, this is going 
to help fix it. It invests in roads and 
bridges and transit. Clean water to 
make sure that we get lead water out 
and forever chemicals out. It invests in 
broadband. 
After the Problem Solvers Caucus, 
which I proudly co-chair, worked for 
months with our Senate colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle—and so 
many of us worked on it here in this 
House—50 Democrats and 19 Repub-
licans in the Senate voted for this bill. 
Everyone from BERNIE SANDERS to JOE 
MANCHIN
to MITCH
MCCONNELL
all 
voted for it and sent it to us early last 
month. 
It is critical to the rest of the coun-
try and to New Jersey that we get it 
done. Not only because it makes these 
historic investments but because it is 
about the country coming together, 
Democrats and Republicans, to show 
that we can govern. 
We need to get everyone on board 
this week, Democrats and Republicans, 
because this bill is simply too impor-
tant for our country and our future. 
There is nothing partisan about fixing 
our roads and our bridges and tunnels. 
There is nothing partisan about invest-
ing in fighting climate change, which 
this bill does. There is nothing partisan 
about making sure that we have the re-
sources we need for our economy to run 
and for people to get to work every 
day. 
I urge my colleagues, every one of 
them, to come to this Chamber Thurs-
day and to vote for this critical legisla-
tion. I know that working together, 
our best days as a country will always 
be ahead of us here in the greatest 
country in the world. And infrastruc-
ture is the best place to start; for our 
President, for our country, and for all 
of us.

STEVE HOWARD IS A 
HARDWORKING LEADER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Steve How-
ard of Woodbine, Georgia, on his ap-
pointment to the National Association 
of Counties’ Environment, Energy, & 
Land Use Steering Committee. 
Known 
as 
an 
intensively 
hard-
working leader, Steve’s accomplish-
ments are impressive. Over the past 
several years, Steve has led one of the 
most innovative and economic develop-
ment projects in Georgia and through-
out the country. 
He has shown exceptional leadership 
in the Spaceport Camden project that 
is a tremendous opportunity for Geor-
gia’s First Congressional District. The 
project encompasses many of the as-
pects of the committee, making his ex-
pertise invaluable. 
There is no county administrator 
who has as much knowledge in energy, 
environment, and land use as Steve. I 
know he will be an amazing resource 
for counties across the Nation. I am 
proud to see Steve represent our dis-
trict with the National Association of 
Counties. 
I would like to congratulate Steve on 
his appointment and thank him for his 
years of service to Georgia’s First Con-
gressional District. 
SAVANNAH/HILTON HEAD INTERNATIONAL 
AIRPORT IS AN AWARD-WINNING FACILITY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the Savan-
nah/Hilton Head International Airport 
for being awarded the second-best do-
mestic airport in the United States. 
Complemented by an amazing staff, 
this airport has shown exemplary serv-
ice to its customers since 1929. 
For the past 5 years, Savannah/Hil-
ton Head International Airport has 
ranked in the top 10 of best domestic 
airports in the United States. 
This award highlights their hard 
work and dedication to ensure safety 
and security, while offering the best 
customer service. 
Savannah’s airport has been a tre-
mendous 
economic 
contributor 
to 
Georgia’s First Congressional District, 
supporting the community with over 
20,000 jobs. Although small in size, the 
Savannah/Hilton 
Head 
International 
Airport has had a lasting impact on the 
people visiting the great State of Geor-
gia. 
I want to extend my congratulations 
to the great staff, TSA workers, and 
Savannah 
Airport 
Commission 
for 
their great work. 
I look forward to the continued suc-
cess 
of 
the

REMEMBERING AND HONORING DEBORAH SMITH 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
Deborah Smith of Wayne County, Geor-
gia, who, sadly, passed away on Sep-
tember 12, at the age of 51. 
Debi devoted her life to improving 
her community and the lives of others. 
Debi loved volunteering and helping 
people. 
Debi’s love for her community was 
apparent during her time as the CEO of 
United Way of South Georgia, where 
she served eight counties and 26 agen-
cies. 
A giant in her local community, Debi 
also served as the president of the Ro-
tary Club of Jesup and on the board of 
the Downtown Development Authority. 
Debi was recognized by the Wayne 
County Chamber of Commerce as Am-
bassador of the Year for her selfless 
sacrifice toward her community. 
I am thankful for the immense im-
pact that Debi had on Georgia’s First 
Congressional District, and I know her 
legacy will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
her family, friends, and all who knew 
her, during this most difficult time. 
RECOGNIZING JEFF LUREY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize and honor 
Jeff Lurey for his long and accom-
plished pharmacy career. 
Jeff discovered his passion for help-
ing others during his time at the Uni-
versity of Georgia’s School of Phar-
macy. 
Following 
graduation, 
Jeff 
bought his first pharmacy in 1973 and 
would go on to own five other phar-
macies. 
Jeff’s accomplishments are nothing 
short of extraordinary. 
From starting the Georgia Pharmacy 
Foundation to his service on the Geor-
gia Pharmacy Association, Jeff’s lead-
ership has been felt throughout the 
great State of Georgia. 
During his accomplished career, Jeff 
served in numerous leadership posi-
tions within the Georgia Pharmacy As-
sociation. 
Jeff has received numerous awards 
throughout the State of Georgia for his 
immense contributions to the phar-
macy community. 
While Jeff’s work with the Georgia 
Pharmacy Association is coming to an 
end, I am confident that his service to 
pharmacists will continue. 
I am truly grateful for Jeff’s con-
tributions, and I thank him for his 
years of service.

September 28, 2021 
SOLUTIONS TO SOUTHERN BORDER 
CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MURPHY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, last week, in her attempt to 
deflect from the Biden administra-
tion’s complete and utter devastation 
at our southern border, White House 
Press Secretary Jen Psaki said: ‘‘There 
are a lot of Republicans out there giv-
ing speeches about how outraged they 
are about the situation at the border, 
not many are putting forward solutions 
or steps that we could take.’’ 
Well, she got one thing right: We are 
outraged. 
We are outraged because, every sin-
gle day, we hear from constituents who 
are dismayed, angry about this admin-
istration’s complete lack of concern for 
the safety and well-being of our Nation 
at the southern border. 
They resent the fact that, on his first 
day in office, the unity President gave 
up on border security and hung a wel-
come sign in our border communities. 
Biden sent a very clear message to the 
world that our rule of law would not be 
enforced under his administration. 
Jen Psaki now has the audacity to 
complain 
about 
Republicans 
high-
lighting a crisis that they themselves 
created and claims she hasn’t heard so-
lutions. Jen, if you haven’t heard solu-
tions, circle back and listen. 
To start, the biggest thing the Biden 
administration needed to do to protect 
our country was nothing at all. The 
former administration had laid out a 
clear and effective border security 
measure that safeguarded our commu-
nities, protected public health, and 
incentivized legal pathways to citizen-
ship. 
Yet, Biden has systematically unrav-
eled all of the former administration’s 
effective policies in the name of law-
lessness just to score political points 
with the radical and progressive left. 
I cannot fathom how anyone in a po-
sition of authority—Jen Psaki, Presi-
dent Biden, Vice President HARRIS, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas—would 
spend 
more time ignoring our laws than cor-
recting the crisis that they created. 
So, Biden administration, now that 
we have gotten your attention, please 
listen to how you fix this crisis. 
Number one, enforce the laws that 
are written. Don’t undermine our na-
tional security with political pan-
dering. 
Two, complete border construction. 
Right now, there are millions of dol-
lars’ worth of building material rusting 
in the desert because Biden put a halt 
to the Congress-approved and paid for 
border construction. This is a disas-
trous waste of taxpayer dollars and a 
tragedy for our border security. 
Number three, reinstate the remain 
in Mexico policy so that those seeking 
asylum can be processed orderly, with-
out putting our borders at risk. We had 
the buy-in and cooperation of all the 
Central 
American 
countries. 
Biden 
threw that cooperation out the win-
dow. 
Number four, require a negative 
COVID test before entering into the 
southern United States to actually pro-
tect public health. The Biden adminis-
tration’s current COVID policy is hy-
pocrisy. Right now, international trav-
elers who fly into the United States 
must show proof of vaccination or a 
negative test, while illegal immigrants 
can walk across the border without any 
public health requirements. 
I mean, hell, in the midst of the 
fourth worst COVID surge, Secretary 
Mayorkas himself confirmed that none 
of the 15,000 Haitians brought into this 
country from under the bridge were 
tested for COVID. 
The absence of accountability and ur-
gency in this matter is shameful. The 
hypocrisy is disastrous. 
Number five, quit encouraging people 
to make the disastrous trek to Amer-
ica. Just last week, we saw thousands 
of Haitians and their families make the 
treacherous journey to our border, 
many suffering from heat-related inju-
ries 
and 
other 
diseases. 
Then, 
Mayorkas finally admitted that over 
10,000 Haitians were brought into this 
country without being vetted. 
Number six, promising amnesty, tax 
remittance, healthcare, and sanctuary 
cities to illegals, stop it. Again, these 
liberal policies are enticing people to 
break our laws. 
So next time, before Jen Psaki or 
anyone in the Biden administration 
criticizes House Republicans for talk-
ing openly about how to combat a na-
tional security crisis of their own mak-
ing, I suggest she circle back and re-
visit all that we have said in the pre-
ceding months. 
The great hidden provisions in the 
new reconciliation package present the 
most disastrous immigration policies 
in our Nation’s history. I don’t envy 
Jen Psaki’s job of having to defend the 
destruction of this country. 
Mr. Speaker, we are a country of 
laws. Our laws need to be enforced. I 
continue to fight for the security of 
this Nation and our southern border. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President and to address their remarks 
to the Chair and not to a perceived 
viewing audience.

9/11 TERROR ATTACKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, we re-
membered the 20th anniversary of the 
9/11 terror attacks. I rise today to re-
member the innocent lives that we 
lost. 
At 
8:46 
a.m., 
American 
Airlines 
Flight 11 flew into tower one of the 
World Trade Center. Not long after, 
Flight 175 roared over lower Manhattan 
into tower two. 
While Americans around the country 
were grappling with the events that 
had just transpired, a third plane, 
Flight 77, crashed into the Pentagon, 
the center of our Armed Forces and na-
tional defense. 
In 
southwest 
Pennsylvania, 
the 
fourth flight, United 93, originally 
headed to San Francisco, was hijacked 
and made the abrupt turn toward 
Washington, D.C. But because of the 
brave passengers and crew members 
who attempted to take back the plane, 
it crashed into a field in Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania. 
Now, I had the humbling opportunity 
to join over 450 family members of 
United Flight 93 passengers and crew 
members at the memorial site on the 
20th anniversary of that tragic day. 
During the ceremony, we heard from 
Captain Kurtz, USS Somerset; Governor 
Wolf; Gordon Felt, brother of Edward 
Porter Felt, who perished in the crash; 
Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, 
Vice President KAMALA
HARRIS; and 
former President George W. Bush. 
The ceremony was a chance to reflect 
on the events of that fateful day and to 
honor the lives lost and the heroes that 
united us. 
In the days, weeks, months, and now 
two decades that followed September 
11, our country joined together to face 
the very evil which attempted to take 
us down. 
We will forever be indebted to our 
servicemen and -women who joined the 
fight to protect our freedoms. We must 
remember the sacrifices made by our 
servicemembers and the first respond-
ers and their families every day since. 
While today’s world has grown no 
less dangerous, we, as Americans, are 
resilient. We will continue to fight the 
evil and terror that exists today, and 
we will continue to be a beacon of free-
dom to the world. 
Let us reflect on the gift of life so 
tragically lost at the World Trade Cen-
ter in New York City, the Pentagon in 
Washington, 
D.C., 
and 
a 
field 
in 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 
Let us honor the memory of every 
American who perished on that fateful 
day. Their legacies will be forever en-
twined with the strength and courage 
that define our great country. 
We will never forget, not 20 years 
later, not ever. May God continue to 
watch over our first responders, our 
men and women in uniform, and all 
those who keep us safe.

ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Return to us, O God; dwell in the 
midst of us, in this place, in our cities, 
neighborhoods, and Nation, that we 
would again acknowledge You. May 
You see reason to call us faithful, and 
may we reflect Your glory to all who 
would see. 
In You, may both youth and those of 
age find reason to be joyful. May all 
marvel at Your handiwork, Your stead-
fast love, and Your saving mercy. 
Cause our hands to be strong to do 
the work You have set before us. Sow 
Your peace in the fields of our hearts 
and bring forth Your fruit in the gar-
den You have called us to attend. Give 
increase to our fellowship and pour out 
on Your house a spirit of compassion 
and mutual concern. 
We give ourselves over to Your in-
struction to speak truth to one an-
other, to render judgments that are 
true, and to find solutions which lead 
to peace. 
May we not harbor ill will in our 
hearts against each other, but may we 
be intentional in making this a time of 
cooperation and kindness. 
In You do we find truth and hope, and 
in Your name we pray. 
Amen.

The SPEAKER. Will the gentleman 
from Virginia (Mr. CLINE) come for-
ward and lead the House in the Pledge 
of Allegiance. 
Mr. CLINE led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-

speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
HONORING JESUS ‘‘CHUY’’ 
NEGRETE 
(Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, 
I want to honor the life of a commu-
nity icon, an incredible storyteller, and 
a powerful voice of the Latino and 
labor rights movement, my dear friend 
Jesus ‘‘Chuy’’ Negrete. 
Chuy was born in San Luis Potosi, 
Mexico, but grew up in Chicago’s 
southeast side. 
Through his corridos, or folk songs, 
Chuy elevated the work of Cesar 
Chavez’s United Farm Workers and na-
tional Farm Labor Organizing Com-
mittee. 
Whether he was in the back of a pick-
up truck or in a parking lot, he would 
be there and he would play his heart 
out. 
His music resonated with the Mexi-
can-American community because it 
reflected the daily struggles of workers 
and immigrants. 
Chuy loved to add humor to his 
lyrics, 
because 
he 
understood 
the 
power of making people laugh, espe-
cially during the toughest times. 
He believed in the importance of hon-
oring your roots and heritage, encour-
aging youth to learn about their cul-
ture and history, reminding them of its 
riches. 
I thank Chuy for his music, for al-
ways conveying a sense of courage, giv-
ing us animo, giving us resolve, and en-
couraging us to stick together. 
Rest in power, my friend. 
f 
IMPROVING INFRASTRUCTURE IS 
A TOP PRIORITY 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, since I 
came to Congress 3 years ago, I have 
made it a top priority to work toward 
improving our Nation’s infrastructure. 
I have repeatedly advocated and testi-
fied for repairing and expanding our 
roadways and bridges across the Sixth 
District, including Interstate 81, the 
economic backbone of the Sixth Con-
gressional District. 
But the Senate agreement up this 
week allocates just $110 billion for 
roads and bridges, less than 15 percent 
of the total bill’s funding. 
Further, House Democrats are tying 
its passage to the $4.3 trillion tax-and- 
spend boondoggle they call human in-
frastructure. 
The bill includes $7.5 billion to create 
a Civilian Climate Corps to promote 
the Green New Deal, $80 billion for the 
IRS to double the number of agents 
that will target American families and 
businesses, and provides a zero percent 
increase for Homeland Security as the 
Biden border crisis continues to wors-
en. 
Additionally, the bill provides $42.3 
billion in tax credits for the wealthy, 
while at the same time raising $2.1 tril-
lion in higher taxes on the middle-class 
families and job creators. 
With inflation on the rise and un-
precedented 
levels 
of 
government 
spending driving up our national debt, 
we cannot afford this loaded legislative 
package. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose both of these bills when they 
come before the House. 
f 
HEALTHCARE DISPARITIES 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic ex-
posed the fragility and disparities of 
the American healthcare system, par-
ticularly in underserved communities. 
Through the American Rescue Plan, 
Congress is seeking to close these dis-
parities to make healthcare more ac-
cessible, with greater quality, through 
Federally Qualified Health Centers. 
The American Rescue Plan funding 
released this week builds on this 
model, supporting improvements to fa-
cilities across the Nation, including 
$2.2 million in new funding for western 
New York. 
Health centers serve as trusted mes-
sengers and providers to connect with 
hard-to-reach patients. Investing in 
these health clinics’ infrastructure will 
deliver 
healthcare 
savings, 
better 
health outcomes, and overall healthier 
communities throughout America. 
f 
SUPPORT FOR THE BUREAU OF 
PRISONS REFORM CAUCUS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my 
support for the Bureau of Prisons Re-
form Caucus and my thanks to Chair-
man FRED KELLER. 
Earlier today, I participated in a 
meeting 
discussing 
the 
important 
issues and the goals of the caucus, 
which are aimed at improving and en-
hancing the existing relationship be-
tween Congress and the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons. This is done through in-
creased communications, transparency, 
and efficiency. 
Mr. Speaker, I represent two Federal 
prisons: Federal Correctional Institu-
tion Loretto, located in Loretto, Penn-
sylvania, and Federal Correctional In-
stitution McKean, located in Lewis 
Run, Pennsylvania. It is critical Con-
gress continues to support these hard-
working men and women at these Fed-
eral institutions. 
As a member of the Bureau of Pris-
ons Reform Caucus, I will work to 
oversee the implementation of the pro-
grams laid out in our legislation. 
From improving staffing conditions 
to implementing the First Step Act to 
expanding 
current 
technical 
edu-
cational opportunities for inmates as 
they look to find a better place in soci-
ety, it is important we understand the 
actions taking place in our Federal 
prison system. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that this 
caucus continues to meet and improve 
the relationship between Congress and 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

IN SUPPORT OF THE BUILD BACK 
BETTER ACT 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Build Back Better Act, 
which makes critical investments to 
green our economy and protect our en-
vironment. 
The Committee on Oversight and Re-
form’s portion of this bill provides 
nearly $12 billion to transition Federal 
fleets, including the Postal Service, to 
electric vehicles, making the United 
States a leader on climate change by 
building an environmentally friendly 
fleet of the future. 
I am especially pleased that we have 
included dedicated funding for imple-
mentation of the President’s Justice40 
Initiative, a commitment to ensure 
that at least 40 percent of the benefits 
of infrastructure investments go to 
communities most impacted by envi-
ronmental injustice. 
The Build Back Better Act is a cru-
cial piece of legislation that will pro-
mote equity and protect our environ-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF LIEUTENANT 
COLONEL STUART SCHELLER 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, Lieu-
tenant Colonel Stuart Scheller is an 
American patriot who dared to speak 
the truth. 
He knew that a 4-minute and 45-sec-
ond video could bring his storied 17- 
year career in the United States Ma-
rine Corps to a screeching halt, but he 
did not care. 
He laid it all down and spoke truth to 
power. 
He said what every other service-
member knew in their heart was true: 
The incompetence of the Biden White 
House cost American lives. 
Their sin was unpardonable and dead-
ly. Lieutenant Colonel Scheller called 
them out, but they couldn’t handle the 
criticism. 
He was ordered to undergo mental 
health screening because he stood up to 
incompetence. Today, right now, this 
very second, he sits behind bars in my 
home State of North Carolina, shack-
led in a military brig, while those who 
orchestrated Biden’s incompetent Af-
ghanistan withdrawal walk free. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a stain on our 
Nation’s conscience. Lieutenant Colo-
nel Stuart Scheller must be released. 
f 
IN SUPPORT OF THE BIPARTISAN 
INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture package. 
We have heard the stories of cracked 
roads, crumbling bridges, flooded farm 
fields, even kids doing homework from 
fast food restaurants so they can glom 
onto the internet access. 
Sadly, this isn’t the exception. It is 
the status quo, and it is time to fix it. 
In my corner of Illinois, 1 in 10 
bridges is classified as structurally de-
ficient, 1 in 3 roads is rated in poor or 
mediocre condition, and 1 in 4 house-
holds don’t have internet access of any 
kind. 
Our communities deserve much bet-
ter than this. Americans deserve much 
better than this. 
Now is the time to think boldly in 
this once-in-a-generation investment 
in rebuilding America. Now is the time 
to create millions of good-paying union 
jobs. Now is the time to lay the founda-
tion for the economic opportunity for 
years to come. 
There is plenty of work left to do. 
But if we do it together, we can get it 
done. 
f 
CONSTITUENTS WILL REMEMBER 
THE RESULTS, NOT THE PROCESS 
(Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, in 
the coming days and weeks, the Demo-
cratic Caucus will have a once-in-a- 
generation opportunity to make trans-
formative change for our children. But 
if you turn on the news, you will see, 
instead, a narrative about winners and 
losers within our party. 
This is not about winners or losers in 
the Democratic Party. It is about de-
livering together on our bold vision. 
Our constituents are going to remem-
ber the results, not the process. 
That is why we have to come to-
gether to make good on our commit-
ment to address the climate crisis, to 
invest in infrastructure and create 
jobs, and to lower costs for working 
families through tax cuts, support for 
early education, and healthcare. 
We have an obligation to pass both 
the Build Back Better Act and the bi-
partisan infrastructure framework, and 
we 
are 
going 
to 
get 
both 
done, 
strengthening our country and cre-
ating a better future for our children.

OFFICE OF THE CLERK, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,

sage from the Secretary of the Senate on

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT 
AND JOBS ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of the motion to concur 
in the Senate amendment to (H.R. 3684) 
to authorize funds for Federal-aid high-
ways, highway safety programs, and 
transit programs, and for other pur-
poses, with the Senate amendment 
thereto will now resume. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk 
will 
redesignate 
the 
Senate 
amendment and redesignate the mo-
tion to concur. 
The Clerk redesignated the Senate 
amendment and redesignated the mo-
tion to concur. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO) and 
the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. 
GRAVES) each have 10 minutes remain-
ing. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and, more 
importantly, I thank him for his tre-
mendous leadership. His understanding 
of infrastructure in our country and 
the way to build it in a green way to 
honor our commitment to our children 
is something that is a blessing to the 
Congress. 
For decades he has served on the 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Committee, and he has done so in a 
way that has taken us into the future. 
But we haven’t had a bill in a while, 
and so I thank him for his INVEST in 
America Act that he had earlier that is 
not all reflected here, but nonetheless 
hopefully we will see some provisions 
in the Build Back Better Act. 
I rise in support of the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill, the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act, which is about 
jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs. Support for this 
legislation is bipartisan, bicameral, 
and respectful of the needs of workers 
and communities across the country. 
Following the vision of President 
Biden, the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill addresses a great need in America 
which has been neglected for decades, 
as I mentioned. Our roads, bridges, and 
water systems are crumbling. Some 
water systems are over 100 years old, 
Mr. Speaker, made of brick and wood.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5474 
September 28, 2021 
Our electric grid system is vulnerable 
to catastrophic outages. 
We must not only rebuild the infra-
structure for the 21st century econ-
omy, we must rebuild the middle class, 
creating good-paying American jobs 
and turbocharging American competi-
tiveness and growth. These are con-
nected. 
Again, I thank President Biden. He 
said: I am happy to work in a bipar-
tisan way in order to have an infra-
structure bill where we come to agree-
ment, but I will not confine my vision 
to that piece, that legislative piece. We 
must build back better. 
I think it is very important to note 
for people across the country who have 
seen infrastructure in the past come in 
and divide their communities, perpet-
uate injustices, environmental injus-
tice in their communities, that it is 
necessary for us to build back better in 
a way that empowers. 
When I say ‘‘rebuild the middle 
class,’’ it is about jobs, but it is about 
jobs in a new way; more inclusive for 
women, for people of color, for younger 
people to be engaged and trained with 
workforce training to participate in 
the new economy. With jobs and jus-
tice. 
In the past our infrastructure bills 
have reinforced that environmental in-
justice and divided communities. The 
Build Back Better Act will undo that. 
With the passage of this bill, accom-
panied by the Build Back Better legis-
lation, with its equity piece, much of 
that injustice, as much as possible, will 
be reversed. 
It is about building up. It is not 
about trickle-down: Oh, this is what we 
are going to do and a lot of people will 
benefit and maybe you will get some of 
it. No. It is about meeting the needs of 
people, both for the water needs or 
transportation needs or infrastructure 
needs in many ways, but also that 
starts and then builds up. 
Along with the Build Back Better 
Act, this prioritizes some aspects of 
justice and opportunity. 
Let me be clear. While the invest-
ments in the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill are strong, historic down payments 
to build back better, we are not con-
fining our vision—as the President has 
said, he is not confining his—for re-
building infrastructure to this legisla-
tion. 
We all know that we have to build 
back in a responsible way to meet our 
green climate initiatives, our goals, 
and our responsibilities in that regard. 
Passing an infrastructure bill is al-
ways exciting for what it means in 
terms of jobs and taking our country 
into the future, and it has always been 
bipartisan over the years here. Not for 
a while because there was resistance 
when President Obama was President. 
We passed a bill, but it was not of the 
magnitude that we needed. 
This is a step closer to a once-in-a- 
generation investment in our infra-
structure, as the Conference of Mayors 
have said. Now we must go further to 
build back better. 
I urge strong bipartisan support for 
this legislation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for his leadership on this 
extremely important issue. 
I want to expose for my constituents 
the real truth about the so-called infra-
structure portion of the Democrats’ de-
structive $5.5 trillion package. 
You can read for yourself in the bill 
that only a fraction of the funds go to 
roads, bridges, broadband, and other 
things people outside the swamp would 
generally consider infrastructure, a 
true and embarrassingly small drop in 
the bucket, considering the current 
state of Michigan’s infrastructure. By 
the way, our roads still haven’t been 
fixed. 
But more importantly, I am asking 
you to read between the lines to under-
stand that this package will stretch 
the long, intrusive arm of the Federal 
Government into your life, more than 
ever before. Your energy bill, your 
taxes, your job, your Nation’s borders, 
your economic freedom. 
As your Representative, I can’t let 
this happen, and I urge my colleagues 
to oppose this bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 30 seconds. The gentleman once 
again conflates, confuses, confabulates. 
The bill before us is a bipartisan bill 
from the Senate, $550 billion of new 
spending on top of the expected in-
come. It is not $3.5, $4.5, $5 trillion and 
doesn’t include all those other things. 
It does include roads, bridges, high-
ways, 
transit, 
water, 
wastewater, 
drinking water, lead pipes, ports, air-
ports, and broadband, which I think his 
constituents want. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN), the majority whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for his leadership on this 
very, very important piece of legisla-
tion. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will make critical invest-
ments, not just in roads and bridges. 
This legislation will also invest in 
transit, rail, electric vehicle charging 
stations, electric buses, airports, ports, 
water, energy, environmental remedi-
ation, and high-speed broadband inter-
net. I will focus on this last category, 
the $65 billion for broadband. 
Millions of Americans are not con-
nected to the internet. In my home 
State of South Carolina, nearly 1 in 10 
households lack access to an internet 
connection, and even more cannot af-
ford service. As a result, they cannot 
work remotely, cannot learn remotely, 
and cannot access telehealth. The 
internet is as essential to the 21st cen-
tury as electricity was to the 20th cen-
tury, and far too many Americans are 
left out. 
That is why I worked closely with 
the 
House 
Rural 
Broadband 
Task 
Force, Chairman PALLONE, and mem-
bers of the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee to craft comprehensive legisla-
tion to make high-speed broadband ac-
cessible and affordable for all. Our bill 
passed the House last Congress as part 
of the Moving Forward Act. 
While the legislation we are consid-
ering today doesn’t include that bill in 
its entirety, and more action will be re-
quired, it does incorporate many of our 
bill’s essential principles. It gives pref-
erence to future-focused infrastructure, 
prioritizes persistent poverty commu-
nities, and includes oversight and ac-
countability mechanisms. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act also invests in affordability 
and adoption. It requires an affordable 
option to be offered on newly-funded 
networks, extends the monthly dis-
count on internet bills, and funds dig-
ital equity and inclusion projects. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, 
communities in most need of Federal 
funds have all too often been the last 
in line. 
Together with the Build Back Better 
Act, the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act will make America’s great-
ness accessible and affordable for all 
Americans. I urge passage of this legis-
lation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to thank probably the most 
knowledgeable Member of Congress 
about infrastructure in this country 
and our needs, Mr. DEFAZIO, the chair-
man of the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee. 
He and his committee, Mr. Speaker, 
and members of his staff have worked 
very long and very late hours over the 
past 2 years—and, frankly, longer than 
that, going back to the 116th Congress 
and the 115th Congress—to produce the 
legislation that served as a basis for 
this bipartisan bill. I also thank Chair-
man PALLONE and the members and the 
staff of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, who contributed a great 
deal as well.

Mr. Speaker, during the course of the 
2016 campaign, Donald Trump said he 
was going to invest a trillion dollars in 
infrastructure—a trillion dollars. In 
2017, he became the President of the 
United States, and in 2017, 2018, 2019, 
2020, no trillion-dollar infrastructure 
bill was offered to this House or to the 
Congress. 
Mr. DEFAZIO, myself, the Speaker, 
and other leaders went down and met 
with President Trump. Mr. DEFAZIO 
was talking about the trillion dollars 
that the President talked about. He 
really thought there was probably 
more needed, but he was talking about 
the trillion dollars. The President said 
dismiss that, that is too little. It is not 
enough. We need at least $2 trillion— 
President Trump, 2019.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5475 
September 28, 2021 
What we have before us today, Mr. 
Speaker, is a product that reflects the 
needs of our economy, an infrastruc-
ture system in dire need of upgrade and 
expansion, and addresses some, but by 
no means all, of the realities of the cli-
mate crisis we face. 
In fact, a bill which did a much bet-
ter job passed this House, led by Mr. 
DEFAZIO. Unfortunately, it was not 
subject to conference, which is what 
the process ought to be. 
However, this bill would enable our 
businesses to seize on the opportunities 
presented by those challenges and to 
create millions of good, new jobs in the 
process. 
And I thank Mr. DEFAZIO
for his 
leadership and advocacy. 
We have before us legislation that 
will invest more than $1 trillion in 
transportation networks—half of what 
President Trump said we ought to be 
doing, but a very significant step none-
theless—in expanding broadband ac-
cess, in addressing climate change, and 
in helping our communities build back 
better and more resilient. 
It would enact a major component of 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda. This is part and parcel of the 
whole. This is a segment of what the 
President has rightfully called genera-
tional, transformational change. 
I hope we can come together and pass 
this legislation, Mr. Speaker, with 
strong support from Democrats and Re-
publicans. The Republicans have been 
browbeaten into opposing this bill, not 
because of substantive reasons, but for 
political reasons so that President 
Biden will not have a victory. But that 
perspective is incorrect. The people 
who will not have a victory are the 
American people. 
I hope we come together, as I said, to 
pass this legislation in a bipartisan 
fashion to help our businesses and 
working families make it in America. I 
use those words on purpose because I 
have been talking about making it in 
America for over a decade. 
I have been proud, for many years, to 
lead House Democrats’ Make It In 
America plan for jobs and opportuni-
ties, a plan with three core compo-
nents: infrastructure, this bill; and 
education, the bill to come, although 
this has significant training in here for 
workers to get good jobs and good-pay-
ing jobs. It is a plan with also another 
core, and that is entrepreneurship. 
Infrastructure has been central to 
our Make It In America plan since I 
first put it on the table in 2010. That is 
because momentum has been building 
for these investments in infrastructure 
for many years. As a matter of fact, 
then-candidate Joe Biden called me up 
and said: I want to talk to you about 
Make It In America. 
We talked about it, and it is in our 
Democratic 
platform, 
Make 
It 
In 
America. 
I don’t know anybody who is not for 
making it in America, either manufac-
turing, even if it is zeros and ones, or 
succeeding, making it in America. 
Businesses, labor, economists, and 
State and local leaders have been clam-
oring for Congress to do exactly what 
we are about to do today with this 
vote. And when I say ‘‘exactly,’’ they 
would like more. I think they would 
have liked the House bill, Mr. DEFA-
ZIO’s bill, much better. But none of us 
get perfect, and this is a bipartisan 
bill. 
Our Make It In America plan has 
called for multiyear, fully funded au-
thorizations to address the backlog of 
projects both for transportation and 
for water infrastructure, and that is 
what Mr. DEFAZIO has been leading on. 
This bill includes a 5-year, $110 bil-
lion authorization for highways, roads, 
and bridges; $39 billion for transit; and 
$55 billion in water infrastructure to 
literally get the lead out and make our 
water safe to drink. 
It calls for making our electricity 
grid more resilient and more reliable, 
which we included in Make It In Amer-
ica. This bill invests $78 billion to do 
exactly that and creates a new grid de-
ployment authority to promote innova-
tion and smart-grid technologies. That 
is about our national security. That is 
a national security demand on us. 
In the Make It In America agenda, 
we challenged Congress to promote a 
modern energy infrastructure that re-
duces waste and incentivizes storage 
and alternative forms of energy for ve-
hicles. That is what Mr. DEFAZIO did in 
the bill that we passed. It is not as 
good, I think, but that is what is in 
this bill. 
The $7.5 billion included in this legis-
lation for building an electric vehicle 
charging infrastructure in America, 
particularly in rural, disadvantaged, 
and hard-to-reach communities, meets 
that challenge. That is why 40 percent 
of the Republicans in the United States 
Senate voted for it. 
When 
House 
Democrats 
traveled 
across the country listening to the 
American people over the last few 
years, we heard what they need to 
make it in America. We heard about 
the need to expand access to high-speed 
internet, including deployment of 5G 
wireless infrastructure. That is what 
Mr. DEFAZIO did, and that is what this 
Senate bill does. This bill achieves 
those goals by including $65 billion to 
bring broadband access to nearly all 
Americans by auctioning new spectrum 
for 5G wireless. That is what Whip CLY-
BURN was talking about, making sure 
that all of us can make it in America 
because we have access to the internet. 
It is also about education, and we 
have called for reforms that allow for 
stackable credentials for students pre-
paring for the workforce as well as 
those already in the workforce looking 
to get ahead by learning new skills. 
This bill before us today includes 
provisions that provide States with 
flexibility in how they use funding to 
strengthen workforce development. We 
all talk about that. It helps more peo-
ple train for in-demand skills, such as 
engineering. 
In so many ways, the bipartisan In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
is a product of House Democrats—Mr. 
DEFAZIO, Mr. SCOTT, Mr. PALLONE, Mr. 
NEAL—and, yes, many Republicans who 
have also talked about making it in 
America. 
We have been united in promoting 
this agenda for 10 years, and now we 
have the chance to effect a large por-
tion of it. 
Mr. Trump talked about it; he just 
didn’t do it. 
This legislation, of course, is just 
one-half of an even larger effort, as I 
said, by President Biden and Demo-
crats to achieve that objective of help-
ing our people make it in America. 
The other piece is the Build Back 
Better Act. That legislation, which is 
progressing steadily toward consider-
ation on the floor, would enact the re-
mainder of President Biden and Demo-
crats’ 
domestic 
agenda, 
including 
major efforts to address the climate 
crisis and reforms that will help mil-
lions of American families achieve eco-
nomic security. 
We all talk about being pro-family. 
That is pro-family. Childcare is pro- 
family. Earned income tax credit is 
pro-family. Expanding Medicaid is pro- 
family. So much. And if we are pro- 
family, we need to support those items. 
While the bipartisan Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act makes invest-
ments toward tackling the climate cri-
sis, the Build Back Better Act will 
take the steps needed to transition our 
economy to clean energy in line with 
the President’s commitment to the 
Paris 
climate 
agreement 
and 
Mr. 
DEFAZIO’s bill that we passed through 
this House. 
Where this legislation today invests 
in our Nation’s physical infrastructure, 
the Build Back Better Act makes in-
vestment in America’s human infra-
structure. 
When I go to a building and cut a rib-
bon at some base or whatever, I say 
that is very nice, this physical struc-
ture, but if we build great bricks and 
mortar but don’t have people who can 
do the job, we build in vain. 
In our working families, in our com-
munities, that is what we invest in, in 
opportunities for hardworking Ameri-
cans to get ahead. 
We are moving steadily ahead with 
that bill, and I am hopeful that we are 
nearing the finish line. I look forward 
to bringing that bill, the Build Back 
Better Act, to the floor soon. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe Democrats 
will demonstrate unity on both pieces 
of legislation as we put President 
Biden and congressional Democrats’ 
agenda into action. Let’s get it done. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
This body could and should have 
worked together on bipartisan legisla-
tion to improve our roads and our 
bridges, wastewater infrastructure, and 
other vital infrastructure components. 
But instead, the majority preferred to 
put us through a very highly partisan

H5476 
September 28, 2021 
messaging exercise. And for what? The 
majority leaders’ grossly mismanaged 
process. 
I have no doubt that they thought 
that their ‘‘my way or the highway’’ 
approach reflected all their progressive 
priorities, and they were mighty proud 
of it. But it led to the House, both Re-
publicans and Democrats, being com-
pletely sidelined in this process. And 
we knew that this was the most likely 
outcome. 
I want to highlight two key points. 
The first is that today’s legislation is 
one of the largest infrastructure bills 
ever before the House, but because of 
the Speaker’s mismanagement of this 
entire process, the House failed to be 
taken seriously and failed to have any 
input into this bill. 
The second point is that this bill is a 
Trojan horse for reconciliation. We all 
know that. Voting for this bill is a vote 
for Speaker PELOSI’s $3.5 trillion spend-
ing spree, and there is no way to sepa-
rate the two. Even the Speaker ac-
knowledges this, and many others as 
well. 
Lost among all of these poor deci-
sions is the absolute necessity to ad-
dress 
America’s 
real 
infrastructure 
needs. I firmly believe that the work 
we do on the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee is critical to the 
economy and to the lives of all Ameri-
cans, and if the House process was bi-
partisan from the very start, this con-
versation would have been much dif-
ferent, but here we are. Instead of zero-
ing in on real infrastructure, the ma-
jority is talking about spending tril-
lions and trillions of dollars on every-
thing that they can think of, and I 
have to ask: When does it end? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we could have perhaps 
had a bipartisan bill out of the House, 
except for the unified rejection of cli-
mate change on the other side of the 
aisle. 
Transportation is the largest single 
emitter of CO2 pollution in the coun-
try. This is a critical threat to our 
country, to the world, and we have to 
deal with it. 
The bill we wrote and passed would 
have dealt with that very meaningfully 
and moved us into 21st century infra-
structure. This bill contains some of 
those elements that even the Repub-
licans on this side would not support. 
EV charging, nope, not in their bill. 
Electric buses, nope, not in their bill. 
Electric school buses, nope, not in 
their bill. None of those things were in 
their bill. 
In fact, their alternative, which they 
didn’t even offer on the floor, by the 
way—so they don’t really have an al-
ternative—was $350 billion for high-
ways, status quo, with an increase in 
spending. No changes in policy except 
for the one, RODNEY
DAVIS’ thing, 
which is in the Senate bill, to gut 
NEPA. Then, transit flatlined over 5 
years, and rail, zero—goose egg, zero. 
b 1245 
No wastewater, no reconnecting com-
munities, no drinking water, no lead 
pipes. And by the way, every billion we 
spend on wastewater or drinking water 
creates 20,000 good-paying jobs. No 
broadband in their bill. And the list 
goes on and on. 
So we don’t have a real alternative 
on that side of the aisle. And should 
they help to vote this down, they op-
pose it, then they have no answer. The 
answer is a continuing resolution, sta-
tus quo, funding, flat funding. 
Not dealing with the 400,000 bridges 
in America that need substantial re-
pair or replacement. The 40 percent of 
the National Highway System which 
has deteriorated to the point where it 
has to be rebuilt from the roadbed up. 
The $100 billion-dollar backlog in tran-
sit, a decrepit rail system—we just had 
a derailment; people died—and they are 
going to put zero dollars into rail in 
their bill. 
Wastewater systems that back up 
into basements or flow into rivers, and 
water mains that burst, I mean, we 
have to deal with these things. It 
didn’t used to be partisan. The problem 
is we also believe in dealing with cli-
mate change, and they can’t admit to 
climate change because Donald Trump 
says it’s a myth. And you can’t defy 
Donald Trump on that side of the aisle. 
That is very, very sad. 
At least these 19 Republican Senators 
nodded toward it. They included money 
for EV charging, electric buses in the 
bill—at least a little tiny nod. They did 
take up our mandatory greenhouse gas 
reduction program. They did take out 
our critical fix-it-first principles, but 
we will improve on the bill with new, 
novel programs in the reconciliation 
process yet to come and deal with some 
of those issues, deal with the green-
house gas reductions, deal with more 
transit, more rail, more wastewater— 
in different ways. Drinking water, lead 
pipes, all those things will be in the 
reconciliation bill yet to come. 
But plain and simple, the bill before 
us today is the infrastructure bill, the 
only option. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all my staff. 
There are too many to list in the time 
that I have remaining, so I include in 
the RECORD a list of their names. 
CONCLUSION 
Before I conclude, I want to take a mo-
ment to thank my staff—especially those 
who drafted the INVEST in America Act. 
They have spent countless days, nights and 
weekends working on a transformational 
surface transportation bill over the past two 
years. 
I wish we were considering that bill today. 
But, without their hardwork and dedication 
we wouldn’t be here and about to deliver for 
the America people the most significant in-
vestment in our nation’s infrastructure in 
decades.

Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, they did 
an absolutely phenomenal job putting 
this whole package together—twice, 
two Congresses. Real legislative proc-
ess on this side of the Hill. Even 
though the Republicans lost, they par-
ticipated in the process—not so much 
on the other side. Some day we might 
get back to regular order. 
Mr. Speaker, I conclude and urge my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this legis-
lation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on 
behalf of myself and my colleagues from 
Maryland, Representatives HOYER and RASKIN. 
Our State of Maryland has a proud history of 
innovation in satellite technology and space 
exploration. Greenbelt, Maryland is home to 
Goddard, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration’s first Space Flight Center. The 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion, which operates a fleet of weather sat-
ellites, has its headquarters in Silver Spring. 
Additionally, the largest provider of residential 
satellite broadband service, Hughes Network 
Systems, is headquartered in Germantown. 
Hughes serves consumers in some of the 
most rural, hard-to-reach areas of the country. 
As the House considers the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, we join our col-
league, Sen. BEN CARDIN (D–MD) in express-
ing our support for satellite technology, which 
offers an opportunity for helping achieve our 
broadband 
deployment 
goals. 
Satellite 
innovators in Maryland and elsewhere have 
designed measures to reduce latency by using 
a mix of communications platforms, including 
low-earth orbit satellites and fixed wireless 
networks. 
The infrastructure bill provides broadband 
grants for service providers that meet a ‘‘real- 
time, interactive’’ standard for permissible la-
tency. We believe that residential satellite 
broadband service providers could potentially 
meet this standard by using a mix of geo-
stationary and non-geostationary satellite net-
works or fixed wireless networks. Satellite 
broadband service providers that are able to 
meet the standard for permissible latency 
should be considered for broadband grants 
provided in the infrastructure bill. We look for-
ward to working with our colleagues and the 
Department’s 
National 
Telecommunications 
and Information Administration staff on this im-
portant issue. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I have one 
question. Why are we using an infrastructure 
bill to write the rules for new technology? 
That’s exactly what’s happening today. 
The cryptocurrency tax reporting provision in 
this bill will have long-lasting and harmful im-
plications for innovation here in the U.S. 
So, we need a fix. The ‘‘fix’’ debate started 
in the Senate. But it didn’t go anywhere. And 
I said in August, if the Senate can’t get it 
done, we’ll fight it out in the House. 
So, I’ll be introducing a bill to put the guard-
rails in place to clarify the scope of the new 
reporting requirements. 
We need to keep America at the forefront of 
innovation.

mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. NADLER) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GOHMERT) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 1693. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1693, the Elimi-
nating a Quantifiably Unjust Applica-
tion of the Law Act of 2021, or the 
EQUAL Act, would eliminate the un-
just 
sentencing 
disparity 
between 
crack cocaine and powder cocaine of-
fenses. 
This long overdue bipartisan legisla-
tion would allow defendants who were 
previously convicted or sentenced for a 
Federal offense involving crack cocaine 
to petition for a sentence reduction. 
In 1986, Congress passed the Anti- 
Drug Abuse Act, which created manda-
tory minimum penalties for drug of-
fenses and introduced the 100:1 sen-
tencing disparity between crack co-
caine and powder cocaine offenses. This 
meant that a person who distributed 5 
grams of crack cocaine received the 
same 5-year mandatory minimum sen-
tence as a person who distributed 500 
grams of the powder cocaine. 
A person who distributed 50 grams of 
crack cocaine received the same 10- 
year mandatory minimum sentence as 
a person who distributed 5,000 grams of 
powder cocaine. It soon became evident 
that this sentencing disparity also cre-
ated a significant racial disparity. 
Mr. Speaker, 4 years after Congress 
passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, the 
average Federal sentence for Black de-
fendants was 49 percent higher than 
the average sentence for White defend-
ants. In the ensuing decades, the Sen-
tencing Commission and many mem-
bers of the law enforcement commu-
nity strongly and repeatedly criticized 
the 100:1 ratio and urged Congress to 
address the disparity. 
As early as 1995, the Sentencing Com-
mission began urging Congress to rec-
tify this unfairness. Besides the trou-
bling racial disparities in sentencing, 
the Commission also expressed concern 
over the significant differences in pun-
ishment between street-level dealers of 
crack cocaine and the powder cocaine 
suppliers who sold the cocaine in the 
first instance. 
Unfortunately, Congress failed to act 
on the Commission’s proposed amend-
ment to the sentencing guidelines to 
equalize the penalties for crack and 
powder cocaine. 
From 1997 to 2007, the Commission 
continued to warn Congress about the 
unjustified ratio, noting that ‘‘there is 
no legislative history that explains 
Congress’ rationale for selecting the 
100:1 drug quantity ratio for powder co-
caine and crack offenses.’’ It provided 
evidence for its findings that the pen-
alties exaggerated the relative harm-
fulness of crack cocaine, swept too 
broadly, most often applied to lower- 
level offenders, and mostly impacted 
communities of color. 
Congress, however, took no action, 
prompting the Commission to pass an 
amendment to the sentencing guide-
lines in 2007 as a partial and modest 
remedy to the ‘‘urgent and compelling’’ 
problems associated with the ratio. In 
doing so, the Commission ‘‘unani-
mously and strongly urged’’ Congress 
to take actions on its recommenda-
tions and to provide a comprehensive 
solution. 
In 2010, Congress finally acted by 
passing the Fair Sentencing Act, which 
did not eliminate the disparity, but 
which significantly reduced the ratio 
from 100:1 to 18:1. But the Fair Sen-
tencing Act applied only to pending 
and future cases, leaving thousands of 
incarcerated people without a path to 
petition for relief. The First Step Act 
of 2018 made the Fair Sentencing Act 
retroactive, providing a pathway to re-
lief for some, but not all, individuals 
affected by the sentencing disparity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5478 
September 28, 2021 
It is now past time to finish the job. 
The crack cocaine and powder cocaine 
disparity has greatly contributed to 
the rise of mass incarceration, dev-
astated communities of color, and se-
verely undermined public confidence in 
our criminal justice system. 
The EQUAL Act would finally equal-
ize the treatment of powder cocaine 
and crack cocaine—two forms of the 
same drug—by eliminating the sen-
tencing disparity. It would also provide 
a path to retroactive relief from a dis-
parity that is not rooted in science, 
does not promote public safety, and 
fosters racial disparities. 
I commend Representative HAKEEM 
JEFFRIES, BOBBY SCOTT, KELLY ARM-
STRONG, and DON BACON for introducing 
this important bipartisan legislation, 
and I urge all Members to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in the 1980s, as Rep-
resentative NADLER said, Congress en-
acted harsh penalties for Federal drug 
offenses, including mandatory min-
imum sentences. In the 1986 act, the 
Anti-Drug Abuse Act, it did create 100:1 
sentencing disparity between crack and 
powder cocaine, meaning an individual 
convicted of selling 5 grams of crack 
cocaine would receive the same sen-
tence as someone convicted of selling 
500 grams of powder cocaine. 
Earlier, years before, Representative 
Dan Lungren—he had been here in the 
eighties—in 1986, when this was passed, 
said that Republicans were told in 
1986—with a Democratic majority—by 
Representative Charley Rangel, that if 
they did not support the huge dis-
parity, then they did not care about 
Black neighborhoods and the scourge 
that crack cocaine was creating and 
how it was ruining Black neighbor-
hoods. So it easily passed because in 
1986, no one wanted to be called a rac-
ist. This law contributed to the growth 
of the U.S. Federal prison population 
from the 1990s through 2000s. 
In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sen-
tencing Act, which reduced the sen-
tencing disparity between crack and 
powder cocaine from 100:1 to 18:1. And 
as I recall, at the time, I thought it 
would be good to go 1:1; that is what we 
did in Texas when I was a judge. But if 
I recall correctly, there were some Re-
publicans that said we can’t go all the 
way to 1:1, but we will agree to 18:1. If 
that is not right, the chair can correct 
me, but that is what I recall. Because 
I didn’t see why we didn’t go ahead and 
go 1:1 back then and just fix it. 
But that was what happened. It went 
from 100:1 to 18:1 disparity. But in 2018, 
Congress 
passed—President 
Trump 
signed—the First Step Act, which made 
the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive. 
This law allowed those sentenced for 
Federal drug offenses relating to co-
caine prior to the passage of Fair Sen-
tencing Act to move for a resentencing 
under the new law. 
The EQUAL Act before us today 
truly lives up to the name of equalizing 
sentences for similar crimes and would 
eliminate the Federal sentencing dis-
parity between crack and powder co-
caine and allow those convicted under 
the prior law to move for resentencing 
under this new standard. 
At the State level, more than 40 
States do not treat crack and powder 
cocaine differently in their sentencing 
structures. Passage of the EQUAL Act 
now would align Federal sentencing 
laws with the vast majority of States. 
And I would like to also say in a 
prior hearing Mr. JEFFRIES indicated 
that he intended to go forward and 
would try to push a bill, as the chair 
also had hoped, that would finally 
eliminate the sentencing disparity and 
go 1:1. 
In that hearing, I made the comment 
that if Mr. JEFFRIES would draft a bill 
that did just that, then I would support 
that. And I am very pleased that Mr. 
JEFFRIES, who is a man of his word, he 
did exactly what he said. He prepared a 
bill that fixed this problem. 
I am pleased to agree and to be part 
of what Mr. JEFFRIES
prepared and 
what the chairman has seen through 
our committee, and glad we are finally 
going to deal with this problem and do 
right by the people that are sentenced 
under it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1300 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), 
the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair of the House 
Judiciary Committee, JERRY NADLER, 
for yielding, and for his extraordinary 
leadership in moving this important 
piece of legislation forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I also thank KELLY 
ARMSTRONG, who is the lead Republican 
who has sponsored this legislation, for 
his advocacy and his efforts to advance 
this critical piece of legislation. And I 
thank my good friend, the distin-
guished gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GOHMERT), who indicated that we had 
had a previous conversation with then- 
Congressman Cedric Richmond at a Ju-
diciary Committee hearing about his 
willingness to be supportive of moving 
forward with a bill to deal with the 
sentencing disparity that relates to 
crack cocaine and powder cocaine. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1693, the EQUAL Act, legislation that 
will 
finally 
eliminate 
the 
Federal 
crack and powder cocaine sentencing 
disparity, which has devastated lives 
and families and communities through-
out the country. 
As has been indicated, in 1986, shortly 
after the tragic death of basketball 
star, Len Bias, the Anti-Drug Abuse 
Act established a 100:1 disparity in sen-
tencing for crack cocaine and powder 
cocaine. As a result, 500 grams of pow-
der and 5 grams of crack triggered the 
same 5-year mandatory prison sen-
tence. 
Yet, there is no policy justification 
for punishing crack cocaine offenses 
more harshly than the same offense in-
volving powder cocaine. And there is 
no pharmacological difference between 
how the body processes crack cocaine 
and how it processes powder cocaine, 
notwithstanding the thinking at the 
time. 
Where there is a difference is the 
law’s impact on communities of color. 
The burden has disproportionately fall-
en on African-American communities. 
77.1 percent of the crack cocaine of-
fenders convicted were Black, while 
most powder cocaine traffickers are 
non-Black. 
There was an overall impact as well. 
Our system of mass incarceration costs 
us at least $180 billion per year, money 
that could otherwise be invested in the 
well-being of everyday Americans in 
inner-city America, rural America, 
suburban America, small-town Amer-
ica, Appalachia as well. 
Policy and this failed war on drugs 
has not resulted in improved public 
safety, which is why the EQUAL Act is 
supported by law enforcement groups 
like the Major Cities Chiefs Associa-
tion, the Association of Prosecuting 
Attorneys, and perhaps most impor-
tantly, the National District Attorneys 
Association. 
Recognizing the sentencing disparity 
as a failure, Congress has acted several 
times to incrementally address this 
disparity. In 2010, with passage of the 
Fair Sentencing Act, the disparity was 
reduced from 100:1 to 18:1, in legislation 
signed into law by then-President 
Barack Obama. In 2018, with the First 
Step Act, legislation signed into law by 
then-President Donald Trump, that 18:1 
sentencing disparity was made retro-
active. And now Congress has an oppor-
tunity to finish the job. 
Today, the House of Representatives 
is poised in a bipartisan way to get 
that done. 
Fifty years ago, the failed war on 
drugs was first launched when the 
President at the time declared drug 
abuse public enemy number one. At the 
time there were less than 300,000 people 
incarcerated in America. Today, 2.3 
million—disproportionately Black and 
Latino, many of them nonviolent drug 
offenders—who instead of receiving in-
carceration should have received drug 
treatment. 
It was a failed policy then. And we 
can’t repeat that policy today, as so 
many 
folks 
are 
dealing 
with 
the 
scourge of opioid addiction. That is 
why I am so thankful that we are com-
ing together to pass the EQUAL Act to 
end the disparity and to address the 
error of mass incarceration. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend 
Mr. JEFFRIES mentioning Cedric Rich-
mond and also KELLY ARMSTRONG who 
were such an important part of bring-
ing this bill to this place. 
Of course, Congressman Cedric Rich-
mond has passed on to his just reward.

Of course, that means going to the 
White House to work. Mr. ARMSTRONG 
is still here laboring in the field. He 
was unable to be here and asked that I 
read this statement from him into the 
RECORD. 
He said: ‘‘I wish I could be here 
today, but I am grateful to Representa-
tive GOHMERT for sharing my remarks 
with the Chamber. 
‘‘I am proud to support passage of the 
EQUAL Act, which will finally provide 
sentencing parity for Federal crack 
and powder cocaine offenses. 
‘‘This bill will also provide relief to 
those who have been sentenced under 
the previous unequal guidelines. In 
1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act created 
a 100:1 sentencing disparity for crack 
cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. 
For instance, the law created a 5-year 
prison sentence for distribution of 5 
grams of crack cocaine. At the same 
time, an individual would need to pos-
sess 100 times that amount of powder 
cocaine to receive the same sentence. 
‘‘The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 re-
duced the disparity from 100:1 to 18:1. 
The First Step Act of 2018 was supposed 
to make the 18:1 change retroactive. 
The EQUAL Act not only provides sen-
tencing parity for crack and powder co-
caine offenses, it also solves the retro-
activity and implementation issues. 
‘‘This is not being soft on crime. It is 
being smart on crime. Many Americans 
struggling 
with 
addiction 
are 
no 
stranger to the Federal prison system. 
We know that addressing substance use 
disorder and mental health challenges 
are the most effective way to help 
these individuals as well as improve 
our communities. 
‘‘The answer isn’t to lock people up 
for crimes of addiction. We tried that 
method for decades, it does not work. 
In an increasingly partisan time, the 
EQUAL Act is an example of how com-
monsense legislation can receive bipar-
tisan support from across the political 
spectrum. You don’t have to look fur-
ther than the prime sponsors of this 
bill. 
‘‘I am a conservative Republican 
from 
North 
Dakota. 
Congressman 
JEFFRIES is a Democrat from New York 
City. We disagree on a lot of issues, but 
we have come together to support this 
bill because it is the right thing to do. 
It is also why this bill has broad sup-
port from across the ideological spec-
trum. 
‘‘The House Judiciary Committee re-
ported the EQUAL Act favorably by a 
vote of 36–5. The bill also is supported 
by dozens of group ranging from the 
ACLU to Americans for Prosperity. 
‘‘Thank you to everyone who has 
worked so hard to bring us to this 
point. I urge everyone to support the 
EQUAL Act.’’ 
That ends the statement by Mr. 
KELLY Armstrong. 
Let me just say in conclusion—and I 
appreciated 
the 
comments 
of 
Mr. 
JEFFRIES regarding treatment—what I 
saw during my decade on the bench 
was, whether it was crack cocaine or 
powder cocaine, it was incredibly addi-
tive. And every now and then some-
body might be able to deal with their 
addiction in a 30-day program, but nor-
mally it took a lot longer than 30 days. 
Something I thought Texas did right 
was have an up to 12 months substance 
abuse 
felony 
punishment 
facility. 
Some thought it was strange that a 
strong conservative, like myself, used 
that as much as I did. I saw that this 
is so additive and it needs a length of 
time to help people change their lives 
for such a time that they have got a 
better chance of making it out, under-
standing just how addictive those sub-
stances are, all coming from cocaine. 
I know the second checks act dealt 
with some of those issues, but it might 
be something else we can do in the fu-
ture, where if you are convicted of an 
offense where you are an addict, then a 
long-term 
substance 
abuse 
facility 
where you are only with people with 
your same problem. And it is a 
lockdown facility, you don’t have a 
choice of going anywhere. 
And as I have sat and watched some 
of the encounters in the meetings, like 
AA, that you have there in those facili-
ties, boy, they have a BS-detector. 
They don’t let people get away with 
anything. They have been there. They 
know, and it had a better success rate 
than any other program that I had 
seen. 
So this is a great start toward get-
ting the right thing done, and I appre-
ciate Mr. JEFFRIES, and in the past, Mr. 
Richmond—I know it was his desire— 
and Chairman NADLER, for making this 
happen. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the EQUAL Act 
which eliminates the discriminatory 
sentencing disparity between crack and 
powder cocaine. 
I want to thank Chairman NADLER 
for his leadership in bringing this bill 
before our committee and its quick 
passage. And, of course, I thank Chair-
man JEFFRIES and Mr. ARMSTRONG and 
Chairman SCOTT for their leadership on 
this issue. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, 35 years 
ago, Congress passed the Anti-Drug 
Abuse Act, which created this drastic 
sentencing disparity between two types 
of cocaine; the same substance, just in 
a different form. And as has been ex-
plained, under the disparity you needed 
100 times the amount of powder cocaine 
than crack cocaine to get the same 
sentence. 
There was no scientific basis for this, 
no empirical evidence that there was 
any difference. The harm that this 
caused was devastating to so many. 
For more than three decades defend-
ants have suffered under this disparity 
with highly disproportionate impacts 
on communities of color. That has led 
to mass incarceration and, as I said, 
the destruction of so many lives unnec-
essarily. 
In 2010, Congress changed the sen-
tencing disparity from a 100:1 to 18:1. 
And while that was some progress, in 
2018, we improved on that even more 
under the extraordinary leadership of 
Mr. JEFFRIES by making it retroactive. 
But while it was a step in the right di-
rection, making the disparity smaller 
did not make the sentencing fair. And 
today we finally do that. 
I served as a public defender and a 
criminal 
defense 
lawyer 
for 
many 
years, and I have seen, unfortunately, 
how often our criminal justice systems 
fails to deliver justice. And this dis-
parity is just one of those examples. 
This vital legislation will at last fully 
resolve the discriminatory sentencing 
disparities between crack and powder 
cocaine and correct this injustice for so 
many. 
Our prisons are overcrowded and 
lives are unfairly harmed every day, es-
pecially in communities of color, be-
cause of unjust and discriminatory sen-
tencing laws resulting in mass incar-
ceration and other harms. 
The EQUAL Act is one important 
step of so many that we have to take to 
end this cycle. I want to end again by 
thanking Mr. JEFFRIES for his extraor-
dinary leadership on this bill. I thank 
Mr. NADLER for bringing this bill to the 
floor, and I am delighted it is bipar-
tisan. 
And if Mr. GOHMERT is right, that 
Texas did this some years ago, 1:1, I 
will say words that I never expected to 
say on the House floor in my life: We 
need to follow the lead of Texas. 
b 1315 
Mr. GOHMERT. I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee for yielding 
and with the distinguished gentleman 
from Rhode Island, Judge GOHMERT 
knows, and we know that Texas knows 
how to lead. So I thank them so very 
much for bringing that to our atten-
tion. 
Let me take just a moment to turn 
and 
say 
thank 
you 
to 
Chairman 
JEFFRIES for leading us on and pro-
viding the energy and the engine for 
doing something that is and will con-
tinue to be lifesaving. 
It is my life’s work to use the crimi-
nal justice system as a reform mecha-
nism to save lives and to ensure that it 
is not a system that unequally prides 
itself on supporting the rights some-
times of the offender without acknowl-
edging the rights of the victim. 
In many instances in addiction, Mr. 
Speaker, you will find persons who go 
awry of the criminal justice system as 
victims because they then are not 
given the treatment that they should 
get, or they are not given the recogni-
tion of the question of how you can

fairly address these laws. They are, in 
fact, becoming victims. They are vic-
tims of the system. They become incar-
cerated. They lose their right to vote. 
Their 
families 
are 
separated 
from 
them. They are stigmatized. They may 
lose their life’s dream of being a teach-
er or a police officer or a lawyer. 
We don’t know what lives we lost in 
the so-called war on drugs and how 
many fell by the wayside. So I am 
proud to support H.R. 1693, the EQUAL 
Act of 2021, which will finally eliminate 
the sentencing disparity between crack 
cocaine and powder cocaine offenses 
and provide retroactive relief to thou-
sands of people who received harsh and 
unfair sentences based on this dis-
parity. 
The crack and powder cocaine sen-
tencing disparity is another byproduct 
of our country’s failed war on drugs. I 
have long championed for the equali-
zation of crack cocaine and powder co-
caine offenses. The evidence of the 
statement of support and comments of 
our co-manager, Mr. GOHMERT
from 
Texas, and as well the letter from Mr. 
ARMSTRONG showed the bipartisan rec-
ognition of where we are today. 
I want to thank the members of the 
Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Secu-
rity Subcommittee who collectively 
have had a vision along with all the 
members of the Judiciary Committee. 
What are we doing there? 
Yes, we are there to uphold laws to 
promote the legal process under the 
system called criminal justice, but we 
are surely there to ensure that crimi-
nal justice works. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER of Louisiana). The time of the 
gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Texas an addi-
tional 1 minute. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Beginning in 2007 
I introduced legislation that would 
have ended the disparity, because we 
had learned that most of the assump-
tions on which the 100-to-1 ratio was 
based turned out to be unfounded. 
Those unfounded assumptions damaged 
communities of color for generations. 
A higher percentage of Black Ameri-
cans are convicted of crack cocaine 
versus powder cocaine offenses and re-
ceive significantly longer sentences for 
comparable offenses, and the percent-
age of individuals serving unreasonably 
long sentences is because that dis-
parity exists. 
Let me also indicate, I was happy to 
introduce an amendment to allow the 
courts to grant sentence reductions ab-
sent the defendant’s presence as re-
quired today. This will eliminate the 
court’s logjam, and some of these indi-
viduals are, in fact, incarcerated still. 
Individuals like William Underwood, 
Matthew Charles, and Cynthia Shank 
all testified before the House and Sen-
ate Judiciary Committees about the 
devastating impact that sentencing 
disparity and mandatory minimum 
laws have had on them, their families, 
and countless others. 
I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, this 
legislation is long overdue. I am ex-
cited that the introduction of my legis-
lation now today will become reality, 
and I am excited to be a partner and 
working with Chairman JEFFRIES on 
this important legislation. 
Finally, to conclude, I want just to 
say that race has been a factor, and we 
are glad that we are moving beyond 
that. We must pass the EQUAL Act. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, as someone 
who grew up in a community on the 
front line of the racist so-called war on 
drugs, I am proud to stand here today 
in support of the EQUAL Act to elimi-
nate racial disparities in crack and 
powder cocaine possession. 
The war on drugs was designed as a 
racist project to target Black and 
Brown Americans—my neighbors—and 
the obvious racial disparities in en-
forcement show us that it still is at its 
core a racist effort targeting commu-
nities of color through over-policing, 
criminalization, and mass incarcer-
ation. 
Simply put, addiction is a health 
condition not a crime. Giving incarcer-
ated people an opportunity to be resen-
tenced will transform lives imme-
diately. We need to be doing more to 
make reparations to those impacted by 
the so-called war on drugs. While this 
bill is a great step on the road to com-
prehensive drug and criminal justice 
reform, we must go further. Our goal 
must be to end this country’s milita-
rized ‘‘jail first, ask questions later’’ 
approach to addiction and stop trying 
to solve social problems with policing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentlewoman from Michigan an ad-
ditional 1 minute. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I look for-
ward to supporting the future legisla-
tion aimed at comprehensive decrimi-
nalization of possession for personal 
use of these substances and strongly 
encourage my colleagues to support 
this commonsense bill. 
Lastly, it is a personal honor to sup-
port and uplift Kandia Milton who ap-
proached me about this bill and who is 
with Dreams Corps JUSTICE in De-
troit. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
am 
grateful 
for 
Kandia’s work. It allows me to also 
fight for all of us today. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the chairman’s efforts in regard 
to this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, at this time, I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
NADLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
EQUAL Act of 2021 represents an im-
portant step in our efforts to reform 
the criminal justice system. I thank 
Representatives JEFFRIES, SCOTT, ARM-
STRONG, and BACON for their leadership 
in introducing this important legisla-
tion and for assembling a broad and bi-
partisan coalition of stakeholders in 
support of the bill, including the De-
partment of Justice and advocacy 
groups that span the entire ideological 
spectrum. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
bipartisan bill today, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 1693, the EQUAL 
Act, which would eliminate the sentencing dis-
parity between crack and powder cocaine. I 
would like to thank my colleagues Representa-
tives JEFFRIES, BACON, and ARMSTRONG for 
their work to bring this bill to the floor today. 
In 1986, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act created a 
100-to-1 sentencing disparity between the 
amount of crack cocaine that triggered an 
automatic 5-year mandatory minimum sen-
tence and the amount of powder cocaine that 
would trigger the same punishment. This sen-
tencing disparity had a racially disparate im-
pact on Black communities, did nothing to 
change personal behaviors, and has been a 
tremendous waste of taxpayer money and re-
sources. There are no pharmacological dif-
ferences between these two substances. Yet 
more than 80 percent of people convicted in 
federal court for crack offenses are Black, 
while only 27 percent of those convicted of 
powder cocaine offenses are Black. 
The crack cocaine sentencing disparity has 
forced judges to impose higher penalties for 
very small amounts of crack cocaine. This 
also had the bizarre effect of punishing those 
individuals lower in the drug distribution chain 
much more severely than the actual drug king-
pins for two reasons: the kingpins generally 
distribute powder from which the crack is pro-
duced, and lower level defendants often lack 
information on the drug operation that they 
can turn over to prosecutors in order to obtain 
sentencing credit for cooperation. 
Mandatory minimums, whether they are 
equal or not, must be eliminated. The ‘‘tough 
on crime’’ policies based on slogans and 
sound bites have failed, and mandatory mini-
mums have been studied extensively—they 
fail to reduce crime, they waste taxpayers’ 
money and often require judges to impose 
sentences that violate common sense. Instead 
of arguing about whether someone should re-
ceive a five-year mandatory minimum, we 
should be investing in early education, work-
force training, and our communities. 
The EQUAL Act is the next step on the long 
road toward eliminating this unfair sentencing 
disparity. In 2009, I led the effort in the House 
to eliminate this disparity in the Fairness in 
Cocaine Sentencing Act. That effort eventually 
led to the 2010 passage of the Fair Sen-
tencing Act, which reduced the crack/powder 
cocaine disparity from 100:1 to 18:1. That was 
a hard-fought compromise, and the EQUAL 
Act will finally end this disparity. This is an im-
portant step toward fixing our criminal justice 
system and making it fairer. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill and hope the Sen-
ate moves quickly to send this bill to the Presi-
dent’s desk.

MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEAD-
LINES FOR COMMISSION ON COM-
BATING 
SYNTHETIC 
OPIOID 
TRAFFICKING 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4981) to amend the Fentanyl 
Sanctions Act, to modify certain dead-
lines relating to the Commission on 
Combating 
Synthetic 
Opioid 
Traf-
ficking. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4981 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN DEAD-
LINES FOR COMMISSION ON COM-
BATING SYNTHETIC OPIOID TRAF-
FICKING. 
Section 7221(f)(2) of the Fentanyl Sanctions 
Act (133 Stat. 2273) is amended by striking 
‘‘270 days’’ and inserting ‘‘390 days’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) and the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 4981. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4981, a bill to modify certain 
deadlines relating to the Commission 
on Combating Synthetic Opioid Traf-
ficking. 
I want to thank my colleague and 
friend, Mr. TRONE from Maryland, for 
authoring this bipartisan bill. Mr. 
TRONE has been an invaluable voice in 
Congress for combating our country’s 
opioid crisis. Far too many families in 
my community, Pennsylvania’s greater 
Lehigh Valley, have endured indescrib-
able heartbreak and loss as a result of 
this crisis. 
When I first started serving in Con-
gress back in 2018, I made a solemn 
commitment that I would do every-
thing within my power to end the dev-
astation of the opioid crisis once and 
for all. I am dedicated to keeping that 
promise. 
Earlier this year, I was proud to see 
Mr. TRONE elected as Democratic co- 
chairman of the Commission on Com-
bating Synthetic Opioid Trafficking. 
Mr. TRONE, working alongside his co- 
chair, Senator TOM COTTON, in a bipar-
tisan manner is developing a strategic 
approach to combat the flow of syn-
thetic opioids into the United States. 
Last year, the Centers for Disease 
Control released data indicating that 
the surge in overdose deaths from 2018 
to 2019 was the greatest year-over-year 
increase. Tragically, far too many 
Americans have witnessed the horrific 
effects of this opioid crisis. 
Just as we must also take on the 
greed of the pharmaceutical industry— 
which has done a great deal to lead us 
to this point domestically when it 
comes to the opioid crisis writ large— 
most of the fentanyl consumed in the 
United States is manufactured outside 
of the country, so it is crucial that we 
engage closely with our international 
partners to address this scourge. The 
Commission on Combating Synthetic 
Opioid Trafficking aims to do just that. 
Synthetic drugs, unlike plant-based 
drugs such as cocaine or heroin, are 
not limited by climate-growing restric-
tions. Any country can produce syn-
thetic drugs, and according to a Janu-
ary 2020 Drug Enforcement Administra-
tion report, this may lead to a rapidly 
diversifying list of synthetic drug-pro-
ducing countries and suppliers. 
With such an imposing task ahead of 
us, strong, bipartisan cooperation is 
critical. We must work together to do 
what is right and find a solution that 
can help save countless American lives. 
This bill will amend the Fentanyl 
Sanctions Act to extend the amount of 
time granted to the Commission on 
Combating 
Synthetic 
Opioid 
Traf-
ficking. The commission was originally 
slated to start in 2020 but could not get 
underway until March of this year. It 
is incumbent upon us to do everything 
we can to get this right. 
I thank Mr. TRONE again for being a 
strong champion for bipartisan collabo-
ration in the fight against opioid 
abuse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1330 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of the bill to amend 
the Fentanyl Sanctions Act. Across 
our Nation, Americans are increasingly 
becoming exposed to the impact of the 
illicit distribution of fentanyl. Our 
local news is reporting on another 
overdose caused by a lethal dose of il-
licit fentanyl with increased frequency. 
This synthetic opioid is making its 
toxic presence known in our commu-
nities. 
Fentanyl is similar to morphine but 
almost 100 times more potent. It is 
manufactured at a low cost in labs 
overseas, primarily in China. It is then 
smuggled 
into 
the 
United 
States 
through Mexico. 
In cases of overdose, the individual is 
not aware that it contains a lethal dose 
until it is too late. 
This body recognizes that the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China is failing to ef-
fectively regulate and implement il-
licit trafficking of fentanyl. 
In December 2019, we called for the 
establishment of the Commission on 
Combating 
Synthetic 
Opioid 
Traf-
ficking. Specifically, this Commission 
was designed to work with the execu-
tive branch in developing a consensus 
on a strategic approach to combating 
the flow of synthetic opioids into the 
United States. 
The underlying bill recognizes the 
importance of this Commission and the 
work that is still needed. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE), the author of this 
bill and a champion in combating the 
opioid crisis. 
Mr. TRONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman WILD very much for her 
kind words. 
I rise today to urge my colleagues to 
pass my bill to extend the work of the 
National Commission on Combating 
Synthetic Opioid Trafficking so, to-
gether, we can complete the Commis-
sion’s important work in a timely man-
ner. 
As many of you know, my mission in 
Congress is to end the opioid epidemic 
in this country. This bipartisan Com-
mission will help us do just that. 
Thanks to the leadership of Senate 
Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER and 
our former congressional colleague, 
Max Rose, this bipartisan Commission 
was established by the National De-
fense Authorization Act of 2020. I was 
honored that Speaker NANCY PELOSI 
appointed me to the Commission, and 
that my colleagues on the Commission 
voted to elect me co-chair, along with 
Senator TOM COTTON. 
The goal of the Commission is to de-
velop a strategic approach to com-
bating the flow of synthetic opioids 
into the United States, but my goal for 
the Commission is much more simple. 
It is simply to save lives—save lives, 
period. 
Last year, we saw more than 93,000 
people die of a drug overdose in this 
country. We set a new record, a record 
we never wanted to set. In Maryland 
alone, we lost nearly 2,500 to opioids. 
After we made progress in the fight 
against overdoses in 2019, the numbers 
are continuing to rise due to the pan-
demic. As overdoses continue to rise in 
communities across the country, we 
have our work cut out for us in this

fight 
against 
synthetic 
drug 
traf-
ficking. 
Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl 
are among the deadliest illicit sub-
stances in the drug industry today. In 
my home State of Maryland, fentanyl 
was involved in 93 percent of all opioid 
deaths 
in 
2020, 
and 
opioid-related 
deaths were up 46 percent in western 
Maryland in 2020, compared to the 
same time last year. 
We need to act now if we are going to 
put an end to these senseless deaths, 
and we cannot do it alone. That is why 
I am so grateful for the work of the bi-
partisan Commission. 
The Commission’s membership in-
cludes the best of the best. From the 
administration, we have representa-
tives from the Office of National Drug 
Control 
Policy, 
DEA, 
DHS, 
DOD, 
Treasury, State, and the Director of 
National Intelligence. 
In Congress, Republican Congress-
man FRED UPTON and Democrat Sen-
ator ED MARKEY, two champions in the 
fight against addiction, are working 
alongside Senator COTTON and me. 
We have a number of experts from 
outside government, including Karen 
Tandy, Sandy Winnefeld, and other dis-
tinguished individuals. We are grateful 
that Kemp Chester, from the Office of 
National Drug Control Policy, guides 
our work as executive director. We are 
lucky to have the expertise of the ex-
perts at RAND working to find solu-
tions for this incredibly difficult chal-
lenge. 
Due to the pandemic, we were not 
able to begin our work as soon as we 
would have liked. For that reason, we 
must pass this simple but crucial bill 
to extend the work of the Commission 
until February of next year. 
This extension will allow us to con-
tinue our important work and produce 
a report with actionable steps that will 
combat the flow of synthetic opioids 
into our country and, most impor-
tantly, save lives. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I continue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me thank the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. TRONE) for the work that he 
is doing. 
Having served on the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, and now serving on Judici-
ary as the chair of the Crime, Ter-
rorism, and Homeland Security Sub-
committee, I can affirmatively say 
that fentanyl kills. It kills people. It 
kills our children, our mothers, our fa-
thers. It kills the family’s infrastruc-
ture and system. 
So let me just simply indicate that 
the idea of having an extension of the 
Commission on Combating Synthetic 
Opioid Trafficking to join in the 
thoughtful discussion of what we are 
attempting to do on drugs that kill. 
We in the Judiciary Committee have 
been working and secured an extension 
of fentanyl sanctions, and it was in ac-
knowledgment that the community is 
suffering by the harmful effects of 
fentanyl abuse and usage. It was ac-
knowledging that it is imperative that 
we find a thoughtful resolution to ad-
dress the grave tragedies that plague 
communities 
like 
mine 
and 
those 
throughout the country. 
Earlier, I mentioned names of indi-
viduals who were on the other side in 
terms of incarceration because of the 
imbalance in drug enforcement. But, 
again, we say that fentanyl kills. 
Given the importance of getting this 
right, I am in support of extending the 
measure in Judiciary, but I am in sup-
port of having the opportunity for 
thoughtful discussion to deal with 
what our next steps are. 
Any way that we can come together 
to address the loss of life and, of 
course, the acceptance that fentanyl 
kills, and other opioid substances as 
well, used and abused, then I can as-
sure you that we are doing the right 
thing as Members of Congress. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as noted, the battle we 
wage against the illicit distribution of 
fentanyl is ongoing. Extending the 
time allows the Commission to provide 
us a better understanding of the chal-
lenges we face and includes a strategy 
to address it. The valuable work of this 
Commission is critical to addressing 
this poison in our Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
According to the National Institutes 
of Health, in 2018, 128 people died each 
day from opioid overdoses. We must 
not lose sight of the devastating toll 
these drugs are taking on our country. 
We need to tackle the opioid crisis 
from every angle. I am hopeful that 
passing this bill will take us one step 
closer to ending this epidemic. 
I again thank Mr. TRONE for author-
ing this important legislation. I urge 
my colleagues to support H.R. 4981, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. WILD) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4981. 
The question was taken.

WAR CRIMES REWARDS 
EXPANSION ACT 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4250) to amend the State Depart-
ment Basic Authorities Act of 1956 to 
provide for rewards for the arrest or 
conviction of certain foreign nationals 
who have committed genocide or war 
crimes, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4250 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘War Crimes 
Rewards Expansion Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF STATE REWARDS PRO-
GRAM. 
Paragraph (10) of section 36(b) of the State 
Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 
U.S.C. 2708(b)) is amended by striking ‘‘de-
fined under the statute of such tribunal;’’ 
and inserting the following: ‘‘defined under— 
‘‘(A) the statute of such country or tri-
bunal, as the case may be; or 
‘‘(B) United States law;’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) and the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H.R. 4250. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4250, 
the War Crimes Rewards Expansion 
Act, authored by Representative FOXX. 
The bill broadens the State Depart-
ment rewards program for individuals 
or whistleblowers who come forward 
with and provide information on geno-
cide or war crimes. It clarifies that the 
rewards can also be provided for pros-
ecutions that fall under domestic law, 
including American law or the law of 
another nation, in addition to inter-
national law. 
We have seen, time and again, that 
whistleblower programs are the most 
effective type of compliance mecha-
nism, and the State Department re-
wards program itself is a proven tool 
for bringing the perpetrators of atroc-
ities to justice. 
The United States must continue to 
demonstrate that we are steadfast in 
our commitment to holding war crimi-
nals accountable and that the mecha-
nisms we have in place to bring about 
their arrest are flexible and robust. 
This bill is straightforward. By ex-
panding the scope of what rewards can 
be 
paid 
for 
information, 
we 
will 
incentivize more individuals to come 
forward and gain more information 
with which to find and prosecute these 
criminals. 
This legislation has passed the House 
in previous Congresses, and we hope

September 28, 2021 
this bill can make it across the finish 
line this time around. 
This is an important measure. I sup-
port it, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in support of the War 
Crimes Rewards Expansion Act. 
Sadly, we live in a world where 
crimes against humanity still occur. 
We have seen three declared genocides 
in just the last 20 years: in Darfur in 
2004, by ISIS in 2016, and the one in 
Xinjiang that was formally declared by 
Secretary Mike Pompeo before he left 
office earlier this year. 
We have, of course, also seen the hor-
rific 
ethnic 
cleansing 
against 
the 
Rohingya in Burma. We have seen 
atrocities committed by Assad against 
his own people in Syria. 
But bringing the criminals behind 
these massacres to justice can be dif-
ficult. That is why, 35 years ago, we en-
acted the State Department rewards 
program. It authorizes the Secretary of 
State to offer rewards for the arrest or 
conviction of some of the most dan-
gerous people in the world. 
b 1345 
Originally written to be used against 
international terrorists, this successful 
program has since been expanded to in-
clude drug traffickers, war criminals, 
and perpetrators of genocide. 
As the world changes and as inter-
national criminals evolve, we need to 
make sure this important program 
evolves with them. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the War Crimes 
Rewards 
Expansion 
Act. 
This 
bill 
makes clear that these rewards are not 
just meant to support international 
tribunals. They can also be used to 
bring these dangerous criminals to jus-
tice here in the United States under 
United States law. 
I want to thank the author of the 
bill, the gentlewoman from North 
Carolina, Dr. VIRGINIA FOXX, for her 
work on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
CALIFORNIA. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX), the author of the bill. 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
colleague from California for yielding. 
I want to thank especially the gen-
tleman from Maryland, Mr. RASKIN, for 
his support on this bill as well as my 
other colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of this bipartisan bill, which will en-
hance the domestic prosecution of per-
petrators of war crimes, crimes against 
humanity, and genocide. 
Though we often think of these 
atrocities as being tried at inter-
national tribunals, there are many do-
mestic statutes as well that crim-
inalize genocide and war crimes. It is 
important that we can apply domestic 
law in the prosecution of these crimi-
nals, and this bill allows the State De-
partment’s War Crimes Rewards Pro-
gram to offer rewards for the arrest or 
conviction of perpetrators of these 
atrocities. 
Earlier this month, we witnessed our 
domestic justice system prosecuting 
war crimes and acts of terrorism. One 
of the now infamous associates of 
Jihadi John just pled guilty to all 
eight counts against him in a U.S. dis-
trict court. He played a leading role in 
the ISIS plan to kidnap, hold for ran-
som, and ultimately behead four Amer-
ican hostages. Domestic prosecution 
can bring swift justice and allows na-
tions to hold perpetrators more di-
rectly accountable to those that they 
have wronged, such as the victims’ 
families. 
With passage of the War Crimes Re-
wards Expansion Act, we can see even 
more perpetrators of atrocities against 
Americans brought to justice. 
During just the last 20 years, we have 
witnessed three declared genocides: 
Darfur in 2004, ISIS in 2016, and the 
Xinjiang province in 2021. We want 
those who commit these atrocities and 
heinous crimes to feel the weight of the 
law pressing in on them and feel that 
America is hunting for them. We want 
them never to feel safe, never find rest, 
and we know we will not rest until 
they are brought to justice. 
This bill will help make America 
safer and bring perpetrators of war 
crimes, crimes against humanity, and 
genocide to justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important bill. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
CALIFORNIA. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
The Department of State’s rewards 
program serves an important purpose 
by turning the tables on dangerous for-
eign terrorists and human rights viola-
tors so they face the justice they so 
rightly deserve. 
I want to thank Dr. FOXX for her 
work on this bill and Chairman MEEKS 
for bringing this bill to the floor and 
giving us the opportunity to clarify 
this important authority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, the War Crimes Re-
wards Expansion Act would broaden 
the State Department’s rewards pro-
gram by clarifying that rewards can 
also be provided for prosecutions that 
fall under domestic law, whether it be 
American law or the law of another na-
tion. This would further incentivize in-
dividuals to come forward with valu-
able information, leading to the arrest 
and prosecution of some of the worst 
perpetrators of human rights abuses 
and war crimes. 
I thank Representative FOXX for au-
thoring this bill, and I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The stability and territorial unity of 
Libya is critical to the security of the 
United States, Europe, North Africa, and the 
Sahel, as well as maritime routes in the 
southern Mediterranean Sea. 
(2) 
United 
States 
Africa 
Command 
(AFRICOM) has identified containing insta-
bility in Libya as one of its six main lines of 
effort in Africa and works to support diplo-
matic efforts to reconstitute the Libyan 
State and to disrupt terrorist organizations 
that impede that process or threaten United 
States interests. 
(3) According to the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, the Islamic State in Libya (ISIS- 
Libya) is ‘‘degraded’’. However, AFRICOM 
continues to ‘‘keep pressure on ISIS and 
other violent extremist organizations as 
they seek to take advantage of the security 
vacuum created by the civil war in Libya’’. 
(4) According to the United Nations, since 
April 2019, the conflict in Libya has led to 
the deaths of more than 500 civilians and the 
displacement of more than 200,000 people. 
(5) Parties to the conflict in Libya have 
killed civilians, committed torture and 
abuse, 
committed 
mass 
extrajudicial 
killings, requisitioned the houses of civil-
ians, targeted medical facilities, and blocked 
humanitarian access to food, health, and 
other life-saving services, worsening human-
itarian conditions. 
(6) According to the United Nations, as of 
November 2020, more than 574,000 migrants 
and refugees remained in Libya and the 
‘‘continued arbitrary detention of migrants 
and refugees in formal detention centers and 
at informal smuggler sites remains a critical 
concern in Libya’’. Migrants and refugees, 
including women and children, are routinely 
subjected to discrimination, arrest, arbitrary 
detention, torture and other human rights 
violations and abuses. The United Nations 
has called for the immediate release, evacu-
ation, and protection of refugees and mi-
grants detained in conflict zones. 
(7) In November 2019, the Government of 
the National Accord (GNA) and the Govern-
ment of Turkey signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding on maritime boundaries in 
the Mediterranean Sea. 
(8) The Department of State’s 2020 Traf-
ficking in Persons Report states with regard 
to Libya ‘‘Trafficking victims—including 
men, women, and children—are highly vul-
nerable to extreme violence and other 
human rights violations in Libya by govern-
mental and non-state armed groups, includ-
ing: physical, sexual, and verbal assault; ab-
duction for ransom; extortion; arbitrary 
killings; inhumane detention; and child sol-
diering. . ..Migrants in Libya are extremely 
vulnerable to sex and labor trafficking [and 
. . .] are vulnerable to exploitation by state 
and non-state actors, including employers 
who refuse to pay laborers’ wages.’’. 
(9) A November 2020 Department of Defense 
Inspector General report estimated there are 
approximately 2,000 mercenary forces affili-
ated with the Wagner Group, a Russian pri-
vate military company, as well as approxi-
mately 2,000 Russian-backed Syrian fighters, 
advanced equipment, and advanced capabili-
ties supporting Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan Na-
tional Army (LNA) and Russian objectives in 
North Africa. 
(10) The most recent AFRICOM posture 
statement claims, ‘‘Russia continues to har-
vest benefits from the instability in Libya— 
its military meddling has prolonged the con-
flict and exacerbated casualties and humani-
tarian suffering.’’. 
(11) The Department of Defense Inspector 
General reported that, ‘‘Turkey has hun-
dreds of regular military personnel deployed 
to Libya in order to train GNA-aligned mili-
tias and to operate Turkish military equip-
ment’’ and sent thousands of Syrian merce-
naries to Libya in support of the GNA. 
(12) On January 19, 2020, at a peace con-
ference in Berlin, representatives of the Gov-
ernments of Algeria, China, Egypt, France, 
Germany, Italy, Russia, Turkey, the Repub-
lic of Congo, the United Arab Emirates, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States, as 
well as regional and multilateral organiza-
tions, agreed to refrain from interference in 
Libya’s internal affairs, abide by the United 
Nations arms embargo, and advance a 55- 
point communique to resolve the conflict in 
Libya. 
(13) On February 13, 2020, the United Na-
tions Security Council adopted Resolution 
2510, which endorses the Conclusions of the 
International Conference on Libya held in 
Berlin, affirms the need for a lasting 
ceasefire, demands full compliance by all 
member states with the United Nations arms 
embargo, and expresses unequivocal support 
for the United Nations Special Representa-
tive and the ongoing United Nations Support 
Mission in Libya (UNSMIL)-facilitated intra- 
Libyan dialogue. 
(14) On October 23, 2020, the warring parties 
in Libya agreed a ceasefire, which called for 
the withdrawal of all armed forces from con-
flict lines and the departure of all merce-
naries and foreign fighters within three 
months, and was hailed by United Nations 
Secretary General Anto´nio Guterres as ‘‘a 
fundamental step toward peace and stability 
in Libya’’. 
(15) On January 19, 2021, United Nations 
Secretary General Guterres recommended 
that regional and international powers en-
sure the ‘‘departure of all foreign fighters 
and mercenaries from Libya and full and un-
conditional respect for the Security Council 
arms embargo’’ and urged the Security 
Council to ‘‘give UNSMIL a clear but flexible 
mandate to enable the Mission to support 
the Libyan-led and Libyan-owned ceasefire 
monitoring mechanism’’. 
(16) On January 21, 2021, the United States 
joined the Governments of France, Germany, 
Italy, and the United Kingdom to remind all 
Berlin Conference participants of the need to 
‘‘continue to support a ceasefire, restore full 
respect for the UN arms embargo, and end 
the toxic foreign interference that under-
mines the aspirations of all Libyans to rees-
tablish their sovereignty and choose their fu-
ture peacefully through national elections’’. 
(17) On March 11, 2021, the United States 
joined with France, Germany, Italy, and the 
United Kingdom to welcome Libya’s Govern-
ment of National Unity and reiterate it will 
‘‘have the primary tasks of organizing free 
and fair elections on December 24, 2021, fol-
lowed by a transfer of authority to Libya’s 
democratically chosen leaders’’. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States— 
(1) to advance a peaceful resolution to the 
conflict in Libya through a United Nations- 
mediated Libyan-led and Libyan-owned po-
litical process as the best way to secure 
United States interests and to ensure the 
sovereignty, independence, territorial integ-
rity, and national unity of Libya; 
(2) to support the implementation of 
United Nations Security Council Resolutions 
1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011), which established 
an arms embargo on Libya, and subsequent 
resolutions modifying and extending the em-
bargo; 
(3) to enforce Executive Order 13726 (81 Fed. 
Reg. 23559; relating to blocking property and 
suspending entry into the United States of 
persons contributing to the situation in 
Libya (April 19, 2016)), designed to target in-
dividuals or entities who ‘‘threaten the 
peace, security, and stability of Libya’’; 
(4) to oppose attacks on civilians, medical 
workers, and critical infrastructure, includ-
ing water supplies, in Libya, and to support 
accountability for those engaged in such hei-
nous actions; 
(5) to support Libya’s sovereignty, inde-
pendence, territorial integrity, and national 
unity consistent with United Nations Secu-
rity Council Resolution 2510 (2020) and all 
predecessor 
resolutions 
with 
respect 
to 
Libya, including by— 
(A) taking action to end the violence and 
flow of arms; 
(B) rejecting attempts by any party to il-
licitly export Libya’s oil; and 
(C) urging the withdrawal of foreign mili-
tary and mercenary forces; 
(6) to leverage diplomatic relations to con-
vince the parties to the conflict in Libya to 
maintain the current ceasefire and persuade 
foreign powers to stop providing personnel, 
including mercenaries, weapons, and financ-
ing that threaten to reignite the conflict; 
(7) to support the Libyan Political Dia-
logue and advance the inclusive Libyan-led 
and Libyan-owned political process, includ-
ing elections planned for December 2021; 
(8) to support a negotiated and peaceful po-
litical solution that includes a single, uni-
fied, inclusive, and effective Libyan Govern-
ment approved by the Libyan House of Rep-
resentatives, the end of a transitional period 
achieved through free, fair, inclusive, and 
credible elections planned for December 2021, 
a fair and transparent allocation of re-
sources, interim security arrangements, and 
a process for the reunification of Libyan gov-
ernment ministries and Libyan sovereign in-
stitutions, including the Central Bank of 
Libya, the National Oil Corporation, and the 
Libyan Investment Authority; 
(9) to help protect Libya’s civilian popu-
lation and implementing humanitarian and 
international organizations from the risk of 
harm resulting from explosive hazards such 
as landmines, improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs), and unexploded ordnance (UXO); 
(10) to support constant, unimpeded, and 
reliable humanitarian access to those in 
need and to hold accountable those who im-
pede or threaten the delivery of humani-
tarian assistance; 
(11) to seek to bring an end to severe forms 
of trafficking in persons such as slavery, 
forced labor, and sexual exploitation, includ-
ing with respect to migrants; 
(12) to advocate for the immediate release 
and safe evacuations of detained refugees 
and migrants trapped by the fighting in 
Libya; 
(13) 
to 
encourage 
implementation 
of 
UNSMIL’s plan for the organized and gradual 
closure of migrant detention centers in 
Libya; 
(14) to support greater defense institu-
tional capacity building after a comprehen-
sive political settlement;

TITLE IV—DETERMINATION OF 
BUDGETARY EFFECTS 
SEC. 401. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD) and the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1228, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of the Libya Stabilization Act, H.R. 
1228, sponsored by Congressman TED 
DEUTCH and Congressman JOE WILSON, 
chairman and ranking member respec-
tively, of the Middle East, North Africa 
and 
Global 
Counterterrorism 
Sub-
committee of the House Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. 
This important legislation responds 
to years of instability and violence cre-
ated by the conflict in Libya, which 
has laid the groundwork for the pro-
liferation and growth of violent ex-
tremist groups. As various powers con-
verge on Libya to expand their influ-
ence in the country and across North 
Africa, the lives of the Libyan people 
are at stake. Far, far too many have 
seen their fundamental rights and dig-
nity trampled as a result of the chaos 
unleashed on the country over the past 
decade. 
The 
neocolonialist 
mindset 
that 
treats countries as pawns on a geo-
political chess board must end. No 
country has the right to unleash vio-
lence and chaos on another or to seize 
resources that belong to the Libyan 
people. This bill is not yet another at-
tempt to infringe on the sovereignty of 
the Libyan people; rather, it is an ef-
fort to protect that sovereignty. 
Today, though a nascent ceasefire fa-
cilitated by the U.N. has held and 
Libya continues on its path to building 
democratic institutions and constitu-
tional reforms, violence and impunity 
for past and current human rights vio-
lations continue. Dangerous militia 
groups remain prevalent throughout 
the country. 
The bill addresses such threats by 
sanctioning outside actors who fuel the 
growth of the conflict or are perpetra-
tors of human rights abuses. 
The bill also directs additional U.S. 
support to humanitarian relief and as-
sistance efforts to help strengthen 
democratic governance, build a better, 
peaceful future for Libya, and ensure 
the security of the U.S. and our allies. 
Such assistance and important meas-
ures are even more important as Libya 
faces a critical moment for its transi-
tional path with presidential and par-
liamentary elections approaching this 
December. 
Libya cannot be allowed to continue 
to spiral into lawlessness. A vacuum of 
leadership in Libya gives way to fur-
ther extremism, which poses threats to 
the United States and our allies and 
partners. 
I thank Mr. DEUTCH and Mr. WILSON 
for their work on this measure, and I 
urge my colleagues to support it. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, September 27, 2021. 
Hon. MAXINE WATERS, 
Committee on Financial Services, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: I am writing

tion Act. I appreciate your willingness to

not waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. I also acknowl-
edge that your Committee will be appro-
priately consulted and involved as this or 
similar legislation moves forward, and will 
support the appointment of Committee on

legislation. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS,

Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NADLER: I am writing to

Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to

Sincerely, 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chairman. 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the Libya Stabilization Act. 
After years of civil war and violence, 
there are finally glimmers of optimism 
in Libya. Elections are scheduled for 
December. We hope these elections will 
help Libya continue on the path to de-
mocracy. 
Unfortunately, as we have seen many 
times in this conflict, there is still the 
possibility that spoilers could upend 
this peace process. 
We need to incentivize all parties to 
embrace a productive political track to 
establish stable governance in Libya 
and end the violence. That is the pur-
pose of the legislation before us today. 
Under this bill, if individuals are 
threatening the peace, security, and 
stability of Libya, they will be subject 
to sanctions. 
Throughout this conflict, violent mi-
litias and foreign actors have threat-
ened Libya and its citizens. 
Russia is using the chaos in Libya to 
its advantage. As AFRICOM publicized 
last year, Russia deployed high-per-
formance fighter aircraft to Libya. 
Through this bill, we are turning up 
the pressure to ensure that Russia and 
other unhelpful foreign actors with-
draw from Libya and to incentivize 
Libyan actors to support the emerging 
political process and a peaceful future 
for the people of Libya. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH), the author of this bill 
and chairman of the Middle East, 
North Africa and Global Counterterror-
ism Subcommittee. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to stand here today in support of 
this legislation, H.R. 1228, the Libya 
Stabilization Act. 
This bipartisan bill, which I intro-
duced with my friend, ranking member 
of the Middle East, North Africa and 
Global 
Counterterrorism 
Sub-
committee, JOE WILSON, clarifies and 
strengthens American policy in sup-
port of a peaceful diplomatic resolu-
tion to the Libyan conflict. 
The United States cannot afford to 
ignore this conflict. For years, fighting 
in Libya has undermined the stability 
of North Africa, exacerbated a humani-
tarian crisis, put the human rights of 
civilians—Libyans as well as migrants 
in Libya—in jeopardy, and it has im-
peded a return to U.N.-sponsored peace 
talks. Foreign interference has only es-
calated the conflict. 
The Libya Stabilization Act will 
deter foreign interference in Libya by 
placing sanctions on those who deploy 
mercenaries, support militias, violate 
the U.N. arms embargo, and commit 
human rights violations in Libya. 
It authorizes U.S. support for efforts 
to strengthen good governance, pro-
mote anticorruption efforts, support 
free and fair elections, and foster eco-
nomic recovery. 
The Libyan people deserve a future 
free from foreign meddling, from con-
flict and corruption, and from eco-
nomic turmoil. They deserve to choose 
their leaders in free and fair elections. 
That is why the United States must 
establish a clear and principled policy 
towards Libya. That is why I was proud 
to introduce this legislation in the 
116th Congress and again in this Con-
gress, to clarify U.S. policy towards 
Libya and empower the United States 
with sanctions authority to revitalize 
diplomacy, secure our national inter-
ests, stabilize Libya, and provide peace 
and opportunity for the Libyan people. 
I have been heartened to see the 
Biden administration take a more ac-
tive role in U.S. diplomacy over Libya, 
which is a primary goal of this legisla-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, the Libya Stabiliza-
tion Act is a critical demonstration of 
Congress’ interest in ending foreign 
intervention and consolidating Libya’s 
political gains, both before and after 
the December elections. It is a dem-
onstration that the United States is 
ready to play an active, engaged role in 
achieving long-term peace and sta-
bility in Libya. 
That is why this bill is so important, 
and that is why I am proud to stand 
here in support of H.R. 1228. I urge all 
of my colleagues to join me in voting 
for this legislation.

Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, in closing, I want to thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Florida 
(Mr. 
DEUTCH) and the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. WILSON) for their leader-
ship on this bill, and I urge all Mem-
bers to support this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
It is vital that Libya’s path toward 
rebuilding 
democratic 
institutions, 
after years of conflict, is not upended 
by those who seek to fuel violence and 
instability. 
H.R. 1228 sanctions outside actors re-
sponsible for human rights abuses and 
creating conflict as well as directing 
additional United States’ assistance ef-
forts to strengthen Libya’s democratic 
governance. 
I thank the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. DEUTCH) and the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. WILSON) for this 
legislation, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. WILD) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1228, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

September 28, 2021 
CAMBODIA DEMOCRACY ACT OF 
2021 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4686) to promote free and fair 
elections, 
political 
freedoms, 
and 
human rights in Cambodia, and for 
other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4686 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Cambodia 
Democracy Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Prime Minister Hun Sen has been in 
power in Cambodia since 1985 and is the long-
est-serving leader in Southeast Asia. Despite 
decades of international attention and as-
sistance to promote a pluralistic, multi- 
party democratic system in Cambodia, the 
Government of Cambodia continues to be 
undemocratically dominated by the ruling 
Cambodia People’s Party (CPP), which con-
trols every agency and security apparatus of 
the state. 
(2) The Government of Cambodia has taken 
several measures, particularly since 2017 and 
during the COVID–19 pandemic, to restrict 
Cambodia’s space for civil society and media 
environment, especially through politicized 
tax 
investigations 
against 
independent 
media outlets. 
(3) On September 3, 2017, Kem Sokha, the 
President of the Cambodia National Rescue 
Party (CNRP), was arrested on politically 
motivated charges and faces up to 30 years in 
prison. On November 16, 2017, Cambodia’s Su-
preme Court dissolved the CNRP, elimi-
nating the primary opposition party. While 
Kem Sokha is no longer in prison, his move-
ments are restricted, he is prohibited from 
engaging in political activity, and his 
charges remain pending. The CNRP’s pre-
vious leader, Sam Rainsy, remains in unoffi-
cial exile, and has been prevented from re-
turning to the country. 
(4) Since the CNRP’s dissolution, the Gov-
ernment of Cambodia has arrested, impris-
oned, 
or 
brought 
politically 
motivated 
charges against CNRP leaders and activists. 
Starting in November 2020, the Government 
of Cambodia has held a series of mass trials 
for over 100 individuals affiliated with the 
CNRP. 
(5) Since 1991, the elections that have 
taken place in Cambodia were conducted in 
circumstances that were not free, fair, and 
credible or were marked by fraud, intimida-
tion, violence, and the government’s misuse 
of legal mechanisms to weaken opposition 
candidates and parties. 
(6) The United States is committed to pro-
moting democracy, human rights, and the 
rule of law in Cambodia. The United States 
continues to urge the Government of Cam-
bodia to immediately drop charges against 
Kem Sokha, reinstate the political status of 
the CNRP and restore its elected seats in the 
National Assembly, and support electoral re-
form efforts in Cambodia with free, fair, and 
credible 
elections 
monitored 
by 
inter-
national observers.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4686, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 4686, Cambodia Democracy 
Act of 2021, introduced by Representa-
tive STEVE CHABOT, ranking member of 
the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on 
Asia, the Pacific, Central Asia, and 
Nonproliferation. 
The situation in Cambodia has been 
alarming for several years now. We 
have witnessed the widespread suppres-
sion of democracy and human rights in 
the country, as the Cambodian Govern-
ment places severe limits on funda-
mental freedoms of the press, speech, 
and association. 
In 2017 the president of the opposi-
tion party, the Cambodian National 
Rescue Party, CNRP, Kem Sokha, was 
arrested and indefinitely imprisoned on 
spurious 
and 
politically-motivated 
charges. Kem’s arrest was followed by 
a government decision to dissolve the 
opposition party on fictitious claims 
that it was colluding with the United 
States Government to overthrow the 
Cambodian Government. The unprece-
dented move crippled the only viable 
opposition ahead of nationwide elec-
tions. 
The 
ruling 
Cambodian 
People’s 
Party, under the leadership of Hun 
Sen, continues to erode Cambodia’s de-
mocracy by ordering the arrest and 
harassment of hundreds of CNRP lead-
ers, civil society leaders, prodemocracy 
activists, and government critics. 
We must demonstrate our support to 
the Cambodian people as they fight 
against the growing authoritarianism 
in their country and struggle for the 
restoration of democracy and respect 
for human rights. 
With the passage of this legislation, 
the House sends a strong, bipartisan 
message raising the costs on Cam-
bodian officials who continue to sup-
press freedoms and undermine democ-
racy of Cambodia. 
Congress must take concrete steps to 
hold the Cambodian Government ac-
countable for its backsliding of democ-
racy and human rights and steer the 
country back on the path towards free 
and fair elections. 
This is an important measure. I sup-
port it, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume, and I rise today in 
strong support of the Cambodia Democ-
racy Act, which was introduced by the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
As a cosponsor and as an advocate for 
the Cambodian community in southern 
California, I am especially proud to 
speak on this measure today. 
The people of Cambodia have been 
living under the iron-fisted rule of Hun 
Sen for decades. Under his reign, he has 
denied Cambodians almost all of their 
political rights and prevented free and 
fair elections from taking place. In re-
cent years, Hun Sen has resorted to vi-
olence and attacked peaceful 
pro-
testers. He has undermined Cambodia’s 
democracy by dismantling the coun-
try’s only viable opposition party. 
The work of NGOs has also been lim-
ited, and critical media outlets have 
been shut down. Like many other dic-
tators, he fears the day when he will no 
longer be in power. 
As the beacon of hope and freedom to 
the rest of the world, a key pillar of 
our foreign policy must be to support 
the expansion of democracy in other 
countries. 
The Cambodia Democracy Act will 
help push back on Hun Sen’s regime by 
applying asset blocking and visa sanc-
tions on any government officials or 
security forces who have undermined 
the democratic process or committed 
human rights abuses. 
The strong bipartisan bill has passed 
the House in successive Congresses and 
is a touchstone of congressional sup-
port for the people of Cambodia and 
their desire to democratic governance. 
Members of both parties have long 
supported this important piece of legis-
lation, and I urge my colleagues to 
continue that support. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT), who is 
the ranking member of the Foreign Af-
fairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pa-
cific, Central Asia, and Nonprolifera-
tion, and the author of this bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the gentlewoman from 
California for her unyielding commit-
ment to freedom and democracy across 
the globe. She has been a tremendous 
addition to this House of Representa-
tives. 
I rise today in support of H.R. 4686, 
the Cambodia Democracy Act. This is 
bipartisan legislation that I intro-
duced, along with my Democratic col-
league, ALAN LOWENTHAL. He and I are 
co-chairs of the Cambodia Caucus, and 
we were pleased to champion this legis-
lation. I want to note that our col-
league, Ted Yoho, from Florida origi-
nally introduced this a few years back, 
but of course he has since retired from 
this great institution. 
This legislation is a response to 
Prime Minister Hun Sen’s ongoing

September 28, 2021 
crackdown on his political opponents, 
which began in the runup to the Cam-
bodian elections back in 2018. He ar-
rested Kem Sokha, the leader of the 
Cambodia National Rescue Party, on 
bogus charges, and then proceeded to 
ban the whole party, and then per-
secute other leaders of that party. Hun 
Sen also shut down NGOs and inde-
pendent media, including the National 
Democratic Institute and Radio Free 
Asia. 
Unfortunately, four years later this 
crackdown hasn’t let up. Hun Sen has 
kept the bogus charges hanging over 
Kem Sokha’s head and prohibited him 
from participating in any political ac-
tivity. He has also continued to target 
opposition politicians as well as civil 
society activists and journalists. In 
fact, starting last November, mass 
trials were held against opposition 
party members. 
As a result, next year’s commune 
elections will not have viable opposi-
tion party representation, which means 
that once again Cambodia’s elections 
will be neither free nor fair. 
Sadly, this latest crackdown is noth-
ing new. Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia 
since 1985, 36 years, making him the 
longest-serving head of state in South-
east Asia. 
To date, Hun Sen hasn’t really faced 
any stiff consequences for this behavior 
from the United States, and that is em-
barrassing. That is why the Cambodia 
Democracy Act imposes sanctions on 
those who participated in Hun Sen’s il-
legal, arbitrary attempt to smother de-
mocracy. 
By targeting those directly respon-
sible and holding them accountable, it 
is our hope that we can get Hun Sen 
and his cronies to realize that the only 
path forward for that country is to 
allow free and fair elections. We must 
not forget that the principal victims of 
Hun Sen’s repression are the Cam-
bodian people themselves. 
Next month we celebrate the 30th an-
niversary of the Paris Peace Accords, 
which clearly promises them democ-
racy. So I would urge all my colleagues 
to help make good on the pledge made 
in the Paris Accords a long time ago by 
joining me to support this legislation 
and help put Cambodia back on the 
path to democracy. 
I once again want to thank the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. KIM) 
for her leadership in this effort. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I have no 
speakers, and I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
KIM 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, in closing, I would like to 
thank Congressman CHABOT for intro-
ducing this bill and for all of his work 
on behalf of the Cambodian people. 
I would also like to thank Congress-
man BERA for supporting this bill as 
the lead Democrat sponsor. 
Helping restore Cambodia’s democ-
racy is in line with the American val-
ues that we all share. It is also a good 
national security strategy, as holding 
Hun Sen’s regime accountable will 
pressure him to stop serving as a will-
ing puppet of the Chinese Communist 
Party. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
For many years now, Cambodians 
have struggled under an increasingly 
authoritarian and undemocratic re-
gime. H.R. 4686, introduced by my col-
league Representative STEVE CHABOT, 
would direct the President to impose 
sanctions on Cambodian officials who 
are responsible for acts that undermine 
democracy in Cambodia. 
This bill sends a strong and un-
equivocal message that the United 
States stands firmly with the Cam-
bodian people in their struggle for de-
mocracy and human rights. I urge my 
colleagues to support this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. WILD) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4686, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.J. RES. 6 
Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Speaker, I here-
by remove my name as cosponsor of 
H.J. Res. 6. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s request is accepted. 
INVESTING IN GREEN ENERGY 
(Ms. PORTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, the 
climate crisis is a ticking time bomb. 
The country that figures out how to 
defuse it will get huge returns on their 
investments. 
That is why our global competitor 
nations are investing in green energy. 
They know that the economy that 
learns how to manufacture in the 
cleanest way possible will secure thou-
sands of jobs for its workers. These are 
jobs in manufacturing and also in re-
search, engineering, and education. 
In short, the country that best under-
stands green energy today will have 
the strongest economy tomorrow. That 
can and should be the United States. 
I am proud to represent the scientists 
at the University of California Irvine 
who are doing cutting-edge research on 
fuel cell energy storage, energy conver-
sion, and more. We have to support the 
work of their peers. 
To have a strong, stable, and globally 
competitive economy, we need green 
energy. For Orange County, for the 
United States, and for our planet, we 
cannot continue to rely on the tech-
nology of yesterday.

CELEBRATING 
OKEFENOKEE 
SWAMP PARK’S 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
75th anniversary of the Okefenokee 
Swamp Park. 
The Okefenokee Swamp Park opened 
their doors 75 years ago. Since then, 
people from across the world have vis-
ited one of Georgia’s most desirable 
destinations. Each year, over 500,000 
people visit the Okefenokee National 
Wildlife Refuge. 
As one of the largest intact fresh-
water wetlands in North America, the 
Okefenokee is home to various threat-
ened and endangered species. More 
than 600 plant species have been identi-
fied at the Okefenokee. 
This anniversary is not only a cele-
bration of 75 years of preserving his-
tory and wildlife but also as a beacon 
of what is to come in the next 75 years. 
I, along with the First District of 
Georgia, thank the staff at Okefenokee 
Swamp Park for their stewardship of 
this beautiful park. I am proud to rep-
resent parts of the Okefenokee, and I 
am excited for the future. 
f 
RECOGNIZING KELLER, TEXAS’ 
MOST FAMILY-FRIENDLY CITY 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the efforts of 
the city of Keller in becoming the most 
family-friendly city in the State of 
Texas. 
This community of over 45,000 resi-
dents sits in the heart of the Dallas- 
Fort Worth metroplex and prides itself 
on pairing big city comforts with small 
town charm. 
Its history is rooted in the persever-
ance of frontier settlers in the golden 
age of railroads. That spirit lives on 
today in a community of incredible en-
trepreneurs and small business owners, 
beautiful parks and trails, excellent 
schools, and award-winning city facili-
ties and programs. 
Often listed among the safest and 
best places to live in America, this city 
strives to serve its citizens at every 
stage of life, from young families buy-
ing their first homes to empty nesters 
who could not imagine living anywhere 
else. 
In that effort, Keller City Council 
recognizes the importance of fighting 
on behalf of taxpayers, attracting ex-
ceptional 
economic 
development, 
prioritizing the community’s roads and 
sidewalks, and ensuring public safety 
by supporting its unparalleled first re-
sponders. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 
city of Keller and their shared vision of 
becoming Texas’ most family-friendly 
city. I look forward to seeing the in-
credible progress that this community 
will see working together. 
f 
REPUBLICAN IDEAS ON BORDER 
SECURITY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
other day, we saw the press secretary 
for President Biden, Jen Psaki. She 
was complaining and tired of Repub-
licans talking about the border and not 
having any ideas. 
Well, we have ideas. They don’t al-
ways get publicized. Here are some of 
them right here: enforce our laws; en-
force our laws as written; complete the 
border fence and complete all border 
construction; the remain in Mexico 
policy, why don’t we reinstate that? It 
worked pretty well without people 
rushing the border before. 
Require negative COVID tests before 
entering our country. Wouldn’t that be 
something since we are telling all of 
our citizens we have to do the same to 
go to a simple thing like a restaurant 
or a ballpark? 
Maybe we could shut off the green 
light inviting people and sending peo-
ple the message, incentivizing the dan-
gerous trek to come to America. 
Lastly, stop the benefits from hard-
working U.S. taxpayers. Stop prom-
ising 
amnesty, 
tax 
remittances, 
healthcare, and sanctuary cities to ille-
gal immigrants. 
These are the messages Republicans 
have been conveying all along, so I in-
vite Jen Psaki to listen up.

INFRASTRUCTURE 
BILL 
OPPOR-
TUNITY TO IMPROVE QUALITY 
OF LIFE 
(Mr. HIMES asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, I live in 
southwestern Connecticut, which is on 
an artery of this Nation’s commerce 
and economy, and that artery is 
clogged. I spend hours when I am trav-
eling around my district in traffic or 
worrying that the trains, which move 
more slowly than they moved 75 years 
ago, won’t get me to where I need to 
go. 
We have an opportunity in this 
Chamber, sometime in the next week 
or so, of passing a major infrastructure 
bill, which will alleviate those prob-
lems in my district and around the 
United States. 
The problems in my district are hard-
ly unique, and it is not just about 
growth, though every business leader 
in my district says that transportation 
infrastructure is their number one or 
number two problem. It is about qual-
ity of life. 
This infrastructure bill is perhaps a 
once-in-a-career opportunity to address 
and make better the challenges that 
face each and every one of our con-
stituents. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a vote for the 
infrastructure bill. It is a jobs bill. It is 
a future economic bill. And, of course, 
it is going to repair and improve the 
quality of life for the constituents of 
everyone in the Chamber. 
f 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS DELIVERING 
FOR THE PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
STRICKLAND). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 4, 2021, the 
gentleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the subject of my 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, House 
Democrats are delivering for the peo-
ple, and let me explain to you how they 
are doing so. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, 
our economy is growing at nearly the 
fastest rate in over 40 years. The child 
tax credit is cutting taxes for hard-
working middle-class families across 
the country. And by putting more of 
working people’s own money back into 
their pockets, it is generating $20 bil-
lion in spending in local economies, 
supporting local businesses and jobs. 
Now, Madam Speaker, we are hard at 
work to deliver even more for working 
families through the Build Back Better 
plan and the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill. 
But while House Democrats are deliv-
ering for the people, unfortunately, 
some on the other side of the aisle are 
promoting misinformation about the 
coronavirus and opposing overwhelm-
ingly popular vaccine mandates that 
will save lives and keep our schools 
open. Some of them, Madam Speaker, 
have even spread false narratives about 
the attack on our Capitol and on this 
Chamber nearly 9 months ago. 
As The New York Times reported 
earlier this month: ‘‘A growing number 
of Republicans and their media allies 
have downplayed the riot. Some have 
begun to treat it as a heroic act.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this dangerous rhet-
oric from Republicans continues as 
Senate Leader MITCH MCCONNELL now 
threatens the full faith and credit of 
the United States, and Senate Repub-
licans refuse to do their job to ensure 
that America can pay its bills on time. 
Let’s be clear, Madam Speaker, rais-
ing or suspending the debt limit does 
not authorize new spending. It is about 
meeting obligations that the govern-
ment has already made, including the 
bipartisan COVID relief package passed 
last year in December and vital pay-
ments to Social Security recipients as 
well. 
In fact, much of the debt was accu-
mulated under President Trump. The 
massive tax giveaways for millionaires 
and 
billionaires 
that 
Republicans 
pushed through under President Trump 
added $1.8 trillion to the national debt, 
and a full 97 percent, Madam Speaker, 
of the total debt subject to the limit 
was 
accumulated 
before 
President 
Biden took office. 
Madam Speaker, it is no surprise 
that congressional Republicans voted 
three times—not once, not twice, but 
three times—to suspend the debt limit 
under President Trump. 
b 1700 
Leader MCCONNELL and congressional 
Republicans know what is at stake. In 
2019, MITCH
MCCONNELL
himself said 
that raising the debt ceiling, and I am 
going to quote, Madam Speaker, ‘‘en-
sures our Federal Government will not 
approach any kind of short-term debt 
crisis in the coming weeks or months. 
It secures our Nation’s full faith and 
credit and ensures that Congress will 
not throw this kind of unnecessary 
wrench into the gears of job growth 
and a thriving economy.’’ 
Not my words, Madam Speaker, 
MITCH MCCONNELL’s words. He said it 
himself. 
This 
is 
about 
supporting 
American jobs and our economy. This 
is about doing our job for the American 
people. 
We urge Leader MCCONNELL: Stop 
playing games with the full faith and 
credit of the United States. Stop play-
ing games with American jobs. Do your 
job to ensure that America can pay its 
bills on time by addressing the debt 
limit. 
Now, I think it is important for the 
American people to understand why we 
are here standing up for the credit of 
the United States, and I can think of 
no one better to help explain precisely 
that than my good friend, the distin-
guished gentleman from Pennsylvania 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT). 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. CART-
WRIGHT). 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished gentleman 
from Colorado for yielding. 
It is true. Today, in the Congress, the 
Treasury 
Secretary 
of 
the 
United 
States, Janet Yellen, testified that we 
will run out of borrowing ability on Oc-
tober 18, next month. What this is, is a 
pernicious, dangerous threat to the 
United States of America that is hap-
pening right now. A lot of people don’t 
realize it because, as Mr. NEGUSE just 
mentioned, extending or suspending 
the debt limit has been a routine, a 
normal thing for us to do, something 
that, in the words of Senator MCCON-
NELL himself, is essential for keeping 
our economy moving, protecting Amer-
ican jobs, and preserving the liveli-
hoods of many, many Americans. 
So the question is, what are we 
doing? Why do we have to do this? Why 
do we have to stand here tonight and 
stand up for the full faith and credit of 
the United States? 
It is because the economy depends on 
it, not only the economy of America, 
but the economy of the world depends 
on the full faith and credit of the 
United States of America. 
Credit is vital to the operation of any 
economy. Any businessperson knows 
that. Every businessman, every busi-
nesswoman knows that his or her busi-
ness runs on their credit and their 
credit rating. They know that credit, 
every loan, every loan decision, is 
based on the strength of the promise to 
repay, and that is what we are talking 
about here. 
If a promise to repay a loan isn’t 
strong, that loan is not made. If the 
strength of the promise to repay a loan 
is not there, then either the loan is not 
made or they have to charge a much 
higher interest rate to reflect the extra 
risk in getting repaid. It is all about 
repaying your loans. 
If there is one thing that has been a 
constant in these United States, and 
something that we have been really 
proud of in our Nation for generation 
after generation, it is that if there is 
one rock-solid, dependable promise in 
the world, it is that the United States 
of America will pay its bills. That is a 
rock-solid promise, and it is something 
that reverberates in the world’s econo-
mies. 
That is why we have such a strong 
economy and a base from which to 
grow it. That is why we are able to run 
a government and build bridges and 
roads, and why we are able to maintain 
armed services in this country. It is 
why we are able to function as a nation 
and as an economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5500 
September 28, 2021 
It is the foundation for our country’s 
credit and financial systems. It is the 
source of confidence that powers our 
national economy. It is what makes 
our American dollar the currency of 
the world. 
To threaten that by threatening to 
crash our obligations, to default on the 
obligation of the United States, it is 
the most irresponsible thing that I 
have heard of, even in the words of 
Senator 
MCCONNELL
himself, 
who, 
hours after Secretary of the Treasury 
Janet Yellen testified that October 18 
is the day when we default on our obli-
gations, hours after that, Senator 
MCCONNELL over in the Senate whipped 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on suspending the debt 
limit, doing exactly what he said must 
not be done, endangering jobs, endan-
gering 
our 
economy, 
threatening 
Americans savings. 
What will happen? We will talk about 
this a little bit later. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the distinguished gentleman for 
his comments. He couldn’t be more 
right. 
He raises a real salient point, which 
is the hypocrisy of the minority leader 
in the United States Senate and the po-
sition that he is taking today in 
threatening the full faith and credit of 
the United States of America jux-
taposed against the position that he 
took a mere year ago. 
But it just so happens that we have 
several distinguished colleagues from 
the State of Pennsylvania who know a 
thing or two about the debt ceiling, 
and that includes our prestigious col-
league on the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
BRENDAN F. BOYLE). 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I thank my 
good friend and colleague, the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE), 
who does a wonderful job, as well as my 
friend, my fellow Pennsylvanian, Mr. 
CARTWRIGHT. 
I am glad to be here in this good 
fight with them, but I wish we didn’t 
have to be here fighting this fight. I 
mean, why do we do this to ourselves? 
Here is what I mean. Congress does a 
lot of dumb things, historically, year 
in, year out. I think most people would 
agree on that. 
But of all the dumb things Congress 
does, this repeated political food fight 
over the debt ceiling is without ques-
tion the dumbest, the most unneces-
sary, and the potentially most dan-
gerous. 
Now, I want to point out, for the 
record, almost no other country on 
Earth even has this concept of the debt 
ceiling. In the few that do, none of 
them—none of them—have this sort of 
political fight where a figurative sword 
of Damocles is hanging over the entire 
country and its economy. It makes no 
sense, and there is no benefit to it, 
none. 
Now, year in, year out, when we have 
this, again, dumb and unnecessary de-
bate over the debt ceiling, a lot of peo-
ple, especially people who have been in 
town for a while, will say, somewhat 
cynically: Well, you know, eventually, 
they are going to raise it. What is the 
fuss? Eventually, they are going to 
raise it. 
Sure enough, every single time, it 
has finally been raised. But that kind 
of fight over seeing which side will give 
in first, that sort of political game of 
chicken, has a real cost. 
I want to cite this figure. It was 10 
years ago, almost exactly 10 years ago, 
that we came the closest to not raising 
the debt ceiling. It was in the summer, 
late summer of 2011. The GAO found 
that that delay in raising the debt 
limit, that sort of uncertainty as we 
approached 
the 
deadline, 
that 
in-
creased the Treasury’s borrowing costs 
by $1.3 billion. 
Just imagine what we could do right 
now with $1.3 billion, what that would 
mean for my constituents in Pennsyl-
vania or constituents in Colorado or in 
any State or any district in the coun-
try. 
This has a real cost and, of course, if 
we were to ever go over the edge and 
fall off, the effects, not just for the 
United States but for the worldwide 
economy, would be devastating. 
On the Ways and Means Committee, I 
have had the opportunity to interro-
gate a number of Treasury Secretaries 
over the years. Whether it was Trump’s 
Treasury Secretary, Mr. Mnuchin, or 
President Biden’s Treasury Secretary, 
Ms. Yellen, both have given almost ver-
batim answers when I asked them 
about what the consequences would be 
if we actually did ultimately default. 
Here we are again at this point. 
Madam Speaker, what I want to do 
then is solve this problem, not just for 
this latest instance, but for all future 
ones. So I am introducing legislation 
this week, along with Budget Com-
mittee Chairman YARMUTH, the two of 
us. 
Our bill works like this. It would give 
to the Treasury Secretary, now and in 
the future, the ability to raise the debt 
ceiling. If Congress disagreed with that 
decision, Congress could always over-
rule it by passage in the House and the 
Senate. But the authority would rest 
where it should, with the Treasury Sec-
retary. This just makes sense. 
It would eliminate, once and for all, 
this dumb political food fight. It would 
also ensure that this is taken out of 
the political realm and put where, 
frankly, it should have rested back in 
the beginning, over at Treasury. 
Now, I have had a bill for years now, 
in many different sessions of Congress, 
to just scrap the debt ceiling alto-
gether. The way it is practiced today 
was in no way envisioned when it came 
into existence almost 80 years ago. 
But I understand the practical polit-
ical realities of that, so we are prag-
matically putting in this alternate ap-
proach, this different piece of legisla-
tion. 
I would urge those in the House and 
Senate for whom raising the debt ceil-
ing might be a politically difficult vote 
to consider this piece of legislation so 
that you, yourself, don’t have to vote 
to raise the debt ceiling, but that the 
appropriate official, the head of Treas-
ury, would have that authority, again, 
still reserving for Congress the ability 
to intervene if, for some reason in the 
future, we were to ever disagree with 
the decision of a future Treasury Sec-
retary. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD an op-ed that I wrote on this 
subject just about a month or two ago, 
and I would urge all colleagues of mine, 
in the House and the Senate, to stop 
playing politics with this issue. 
THE DEBT CEILING: A BROKEN MECHANISM 
Why do we keep doing this to ourselves? 
Congress finds itself in an all too familiar 
position: working against the clock to reach 
a deal on the debt ceiling. Failure to raise 
the debt ceiling would bring default on our 
nation’s debt, and likely worldwide economic 
collapse. 
I can’t help but feel a sense of de´ja` vu as 
I remember this scene unraveling two years 
ago, and too many times to count before 
that. 
The debt ceiling was created to put a cap 
on what the government can borrow—in 
order to pay its own bills. The government 
issues debt. Congress sets that debt limit. 
This explains why the debt ceiling needs to 
be raised or suspended continuously. Accord-
ing to the Congressional Budget Office, the 
government currently is $28.5 trillion in debt 
within this self-imposed limit. When the 
limit is reached, the Treasury Department 
can no longer pay its bills and risks default-
ing on its own debt obligations. 
Looking back at its own history, the debt 
ceiling has been raised over 100 times. What 
once may have been a helpful lever that 
could be used in a thoughtful way is no 
more. That noble function, if it ever existed, 
is but a thing of the past. 
Instead, it has become highly politicized, 
costly, and downright dangerous. 
Even if the debt ceiling is ultimately 
raised, just the uncertainty alone is costly. 
During the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations, in 
which a compromise was struck only two 
days before Treasury’s borrowing authority 
would be exhausted, the GAO found the delay 
in raising the debt limit led to an increase in 
Treasury’s borrowing costs of $1.3 billion. 
The debt ceiling does nothing but create 
pointless panic, harming workers and busi-
nesses that fuel our economy. Factoring in 
our current recovery from the pandemic 
economy only exacerbates this self-inflicted 
Crisis. 
Many people have lost jobs or seen house-
hold incomes drastically cut. The June 2021 
data from the Census Bureau revealed there 
are 25 million people who are unemployed, or 
who live with an unemployed family mem-
ber. There is a lot at stake out there. 
It’s clear we need to do everything we can 
to protect the integrity and fabric of our 
economy. Our current process of ‘‘governing 
by a deadline’’ does the opposite. The debt 
ceiling, and the recurring havoc it brings, is 
a completely broken mechanism. 
With Democrats in full control of the 
White House and Congress, we must seize the 
opportunity to finally fix this flawed pol-
icy—by simply getting rid of it. This is why 
I have introduced legislation, House Resolu-
tion 1041, to kill the debt ceiling once and for 
all. 
The time is now to make this common- 
sense change. We cannot wait a few more 
years. We need to work together to imple-
ment smart fiscal policies that grow our 
economy, and don’t threaten to destroy it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5501 
September 28, 2021 
It is long past time to permanently retire 
this sword of Damocles. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his remarks 
and for showing once again the innova-
tive and creative problem-solving that 
the good State of Pennsylvania is so 
well-known for, with respect to the leg-
islative solution that he has proposed. 
I certainly agree with his admonition 
that it is time for our political leaders 
to stop playing politics with respect to 
the debt ceiling. I hope our colleagues 
in the upper Chamber, including the 
minority leader, are listening. 
I do want to zero in on one particular 
thing that my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania referenced, which is the con-
sequences, right? What happens if, in 
fact, the United States Government de-
faults? 
I think a lot of folks watching at 
home are asking themselves that same 
question, so I would pose to my other 
colleague from Pennsylvania that same 
question. 
What happens, as a practical matter, 
if we, God forbid, were to default? 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Sure. That is 
really the big question here tonight. 
Before I get to that, I want to com-
mend my colleague from Pennsylvania 
for that excellent and well-thought-out 
legislation. If I can, I want to ask Con-
gressman BOYLE a question. 
Your legislation that would vest the 
decision on the debt limit in the Treas-
ury Secretary, would that apply to 
both 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
Treasury Secretaries? 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Yes, that is correct. It would 
apply to the Treasury Secretary, who 
currently is a Democrat, but also in 
the future, for years and years to come. 
So, inevitably, over the course of the 
decades and centuries, there would be 
plenty of Democratic and Republican 
Treasury Secretaries who would equal-
ly have that ability. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. When you asked 
her, Secretary Yellen, about what 
would happen if we turned our back on 
our national debt, defaulted on our 
promises, just went back on our prom-
ise to pay, when you asked her that, 
did she talk about what could happen 
to the stock market? 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. If you don’t mind, I want to an-
swer in a slightly different way your 
question. I will tell what you Secretary 
Mnuchin said because that answer is 
more memorable to me. 
This was a couple of years ago, obvi-
ously. It was at least a couple of years 
ago now, and he was testifying in front 
of the House Ways and Means Com-
mittee, on which I serve. 
b 1715 
He was testifying in front of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, on 
which I serve. And I asked him: What 
would 
the 
specific 
tangible 
con-
sequences be if we failed to raise our 
debt ceiling? 
For a couple of seconds, he just kind 
of paused, and he said: Congressman, 
the consequences would be so dire, just 
so unimaginable, that it is really hard 
to articulate just how bad it would be. 
So even he had difficulty going into 
the sort of ramifications that it would 
have. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I am not sur-
prised. Go ahead. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. I was going to remind every-
one—of 
course, 
as 
the 
gentleman 
knows—this was President Trump’s ap-
pointed Treasury Secretary who was 
saying this. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Sure. Well, it is 
pretty obvious that every economist 
that you talk to finds it unthinkable 
that our Nation would turn its back on 
our obligations. When you ask them, 
What happens if we do? The first thing 
they say is that the stock market 
crashes. 
In fact, it would be so bad that the 
stock market would crash more than 20 
percent. 20 percent is the level at 
which—if it comes down 20 percent, 
they have to halt trading in New York 
on the stock market. It is such a catas-
trophe. That would happen. 
Now, we have stock market crashes, 
and then there are other stock market 
crashes, but this is the kind of stock 
market crash that would be caused by 
an undermining of the confidence and 
the faith in the United States economy 
and the Government’s ability and will-
ingness to pay its debts. That rock 
solid promise that the world economy 
relies on would be gone. And so much 
of what drives an economy and makes 
it strong is confidence in governments 
and confidence that promises to pay 
will come true. 
If that happens, that would be the 
kind of stock market crash that would 
presage not only a recession but a 
great depression. The last time we had 
that kind of a stock market crash was 
in 1929, and it led to a great depression 
that led to unemployment rates of over 
15 and up to 20 percent of this country. 
It was unbelievable how bad the depres-
sion was. It lasted for over a decade. 
It would be a catastrophe in this 
country of a magnitude we can’t imag-
ine. Nobody in our generation has had 
to live through something like that. 
As a result, we have to talk about 
these things as if they would actually 
happen. If the country defaults on its 
debt, there will be a stock market 
crash, and it would be followed by a 
great depression, which is horrible, 
horrible damage that would be caused 
by nothing more than a political stunt 
by Senator MITCH MCCONNELL. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Well, I would just sim-
ply say what is so striking about the 
consequences that you described, Mr. 
CARTWRIGHT, and that Mr. BOYLE de-
scribed, in terms of the warning that 
was given by Secretary Mnuchin years 
ago, is that congressional Republicans 
back then did the right thing. They 
heard the same warnings that Rep-
resentative BOYLE described, and they 
voted to increase the debt limit. They 
did it not once, not twice, but three 
separate 
times 
during 
President 
Trump’s administration. 
What has changed? That is the ques-
tion that I wish the minority leader of 
the United States Senate would an-
swer. 
But I think we know the answer, that 
this is ultimately politics and games-
manship. I would hope that for the 
good of the country, he and his col-
leagues would reach the same conclu-
sion that they reached literally less 
than a year ago. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE), be-
cause his experience on the Ways and 
Means Committee, I think, is instruc-
tive with respect to how we dispose of 
this particular question and issue. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, one thing I 
want to make clear, as Mr. NEGUSE 
very eloquently did, is that the posi-
tion on this side of the aisle has been 
completely consistent, regardless of 
the political party of the occupant of 
the White House. 
I voted every single time to raise the 
debt ceiling while Donald Trump was 
President. I have served for 7 years, so 
4 of those years under a Republican 
President, 3 of those years under a 
Democratic President. In fact, the ma-
jority of the votes I have cast to raise 
the debt ceiling have been under a Re-
publican administration. For many of 
my colleagues on this side of the aisle, 
they can say the same thing. 
So I am being completely consistent; 
those of us on this side of the aisle are 
being completely consistent. It is the 
other side, especially in the Senate, 
that is playing this political game that 
is so dangerous and so unnecessary. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Well, I thank the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania. Again, he 
couldn’t be more right in terms of the 
hypocrisy of some on this particular 
issue and the adherence to, I think, the 
morally correct and economically cor-
rect position that so many on this side 
of the aisle have taken year after year 
after year. Our hope is that our col-
leagues in the upper Chamber will do 
the same. 
Don’t you agree, Mr. CARTWRIGHT? 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I would hope 
that, but my hopes have been dashed 
before. We have seen this story before 
in different aspects. 
In fact, we are approaching the 8- 
year anniversary now of what happened 
when I was a freshman Representative 
in 2013. It was October 1. The govern-
ment shut down. At that time, the de-
bate of the day was the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care Act, and there 
was the demand by the Republicans in 
the Senate that we repeal the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
and if we didn’t, they were going to 
shut the government down. 
Madam Speaker, they did shut the 
government down. They shut it down 
for 16 days in October. And I can tell 
you, when they do these things, they 
do damage the economy and they did 
damage the economy in 2013 in the fall.

In fact, in my own district, we actu-
ally measured how much damage was 
done to the economy in northeastern 
Pennsylvania. We have this marvelous 
asset, the Delaware Water Gap Na-
tional Recreation Area, that had to 
shut down because of that government 
shutdown. 
Now, this happened the first 16 days 
of October, which always is a very lu-
crative tourist season in northeastern 
Pennsylvania. The people are out to 
see the beautiful resplendent colors of 
the fall in northeastern Pennsylvania. 
Because the national park had to 
shut down for those 16 days, leaf peeper 
season went out the window. And all of 
the little businesses ringing that na-
tional park in Pike County and Monroe 
County, Pennsylvania, the restaurants 
and the motels and the gas stations 
and all of the little businesses that sur-
vive off the tourism every year, they 
got murdered during that shutdown. In 
fact, we measured that per day. That 
damaged our economy to the tune of 
$400,000 a day in my district alone. 
The question is: Would MITCH MCCON-
NELL go ahead and damage our econ-
omy purposely to make a political 
point? The answer is, yeah, he probably 
would. It looks like he is doing it, and 
they have done it before, and they 
don’t care. 
So it is a sad answer, I know. But the 
truth is, they would rather score a po-
litical point and do harm to our Na-
tion’s economy than stick up for the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, the 
gentleman couldn’t be more right. And 
certainly, the good news, for those that 
are watching, is that House Democrats 
are committed to doing everything 
that we need to do to ensure that the 
full faith and credit of the United 
States is not threatened or under-
mined. 
We have a colleague who has joined 
us who has spent her entire career en-
suring precisely that, and that is the 
distinguished gentlewoman from the 
State of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE) for her to address this Chamber 
on this subject. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I am most grateful for the opportunity 
to join the gentleman from Colorado, 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania. 
I have just finished with a conference 
call with the director of the CDC, but I 
just could not miss the opportunity, 
because I am almost in a deja vu, hav-
ing been here for—even shocking my-
self, because when you are enjoying 
serving, you don’t count the years—but 
more than two decades. I have seen the 
dastardly results of government shut-
down. So I want to thank the gen-
tleman for bringing this to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I believe that it is 
always important to know who governs 
and how we are governed and what doc-
ument do we yield to in terms of being 
governed. And I heard my friend from 
Colorado make the point that Demo-
crats are ensuring that this govern-
ment is governed. 
This morning I was on the floor, and 
I made the point that I don’t stand 
here as a Democrat or a Republican but 
as an American, an American that has 
the responsibility of government. And 
that means that all of the shenanigans 
in the other body should be imme-
diately dispensed with. 
One point of the Constitution that I 
always like reading is: We, the people 
of the United States, in order to create 
or to form a more perfect Union, estab-
lish justice, ensure domestic tran-
quility, provide for the common de-
fense, promote the general welfare. 
This was the very premise that the 
Founding 
Fathers—and 
everyone 
knows the Constitution missed some 
elements on those who were slaves, 
missed 
elements 
on 
women. 
They 
missed some elements; they missed 
some issues. But the premise was that 
we gather for the general welfare, 
uniquely grounded in some values of 
European 
principles 
but 
uniquely 
American. 
Why did we form this government? 
So having lived through government 
shutdowns, let me just, for a very brief 
moment, capture the horrors of a gov-
ernment shutdown, which is tied to ul-
timately the CR, but the effort that 
we, as Democrats, our leader, our 
Speaker, our leadership, rightly so, 
were acting not as Democrats but they 
were acting as leaders of this Nation, 
protecting those who are most vulner-
able. 
So the full faith and credit is not 
something to dismiss. Let me say, over 
and over again—I know it has been said 
on this floor—we are paying bills. As I 
said, if you had the light on for the last 
20 days, you have a bill. 
So to lift the debt ceiling—and I 
would like to characterize it some 
other way—to provide the mechanism 
to pay your bills. If you had the cable 
on for the last 20 days, you are paying 
your bill. So we are simply paying the 
bill. 
The lack of responding to paying 
bills creates inflation, puts a damper 
on the view of America as an inter-
national destination for businesses. It, 
in fact, crumbles the economy on the 
most vulnerable, the hardworking bus 
driver, union worker, teacher. Because 
what you have done is, you have not 
given their dollar substance. That is 
how they make a living; that is how 
they pay for their responsibilities of a 
quality of life. 
I always think of the persons who 
cannot speak for themselves who are 
doing great work. Teachers are doing 
great work; paramedics are doing great 
work; nurses are doing great work. I al-
ways think of bus drivers, because I 
think of school bus drivers. There is a 
shortage of school bus drivers. They 
are all doing great work. 
So let me say that I came on the 
floor because I clearly wanted to em-
phasize the eloquent and important 
points that you are making, that it is 
tomfoolery to make political points 
about the debt ceiling, which is a re-
sponsibility that cannot be gotten rid 
of. 
So it would be okay if I said: Well, we 
would want to say that. When I say 
that, if you are playing politics, you 
say we don’t want to do that either, 
meaning those of us who are governing. 
But it is an obligation of governing and 
governance, and it is constitutionally 
vested not only in the language of full 
faith and credit but in the opening 
statement of the Constitution. If we 
don’t take care of the general welfare, 
then who will? 
I am grateful, as I close, to say that 
I support the INVEST Act and one bill, 
the Build Back America Act. That is 
how I would proceed on the unifying of 
those. The reason why I connect that, 
again, is to make the point that, as I 
have read line by line of the Build 
Back—and I am on the Budget Com-
mittee, and we sat on a Saturday to 
bring this bill forward to you-all. And 
rightly so; we make no complaint 
about that. But to get this bill here. It 
is ready. We passed it out of the Budget 
Committee. 
b 1730 
But as I looked at it, I have not de-
flected the gentleman here, deflected 
families. But it is a justice for women 
act. It is finally penetrating where 
women are in America, in terms of the 
care economy, in terms of pre-K, in 
terms of child care, in terms of family 
responsibilities. It is a bill that gives 
justice to women. 
And so tie it to our responsibilities of 
governing, to lift the debt ceiling for 
payment of our bills, and also this 
book, the Constitution, doing our duty 
to create this Union that has been cre-
ated to ensure general tranquility and 
the general welfare of the American 
people. I thank the gentleman for 
yielding to me and his leadership. 
Mr. NEGUSE. I thank the gentle-
woman for her remarks. Those of us 
who have had the privilege to work 
with the gentlewoman from Texas 
know that her ability to speak truth to 
power really is second to none, and I 
think her argument is as compelling as 
it is straightforward. General welfare. 
Full faith and credit. Pay your bills. 
And so I say to my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle in this Chamber 
and in the upper Chamber, it is time 
for you to do your job. Let’s address 
the debt ceiling and let’s get on with 
the business of this Congress in pro-
moting and protecting the general wel-
fare of our wonderful country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5503 
September 28, 2021 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
we discussed last week some of the 
issues that are of significance, and I 
don’t think the press is paying enough 
attention to them. 
We just had a little bit more progress 
toward the development of fenofibrate, 
which is a generic drug, which some re-
searchers from Israel have had some 
success on in curing COVID. I want to 
talk about these successes and then 
talk what is going to be necessary to 
have happen to get this potentially 
lifesaving drug in the mainstream. 
Two researchers from Israel found 15 
people who were on oxygen and had 
pneumonia; and of the 15 people, after 
giving them fenofibrate, a generic drug 
available for very little, they got out of 
the hospital in 5 days. The other took, 
I think, it was 14 days. 
That is pretty incredible stuff. If it 
could be used routinely, it would dra-
matically have reduced the number of 
deaths in this country. 
Right now there are a variety of peo-
ple around the world trying to do re-
search on this topic, including the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and they are 
grateful they got some money from the 
U.S. Government. But given the prom-
ise of this drug, I think they should 
have gotten a lot more money to deal 
with it quickly. 
I have talked to the researchers, and 
they think they will be able to get to-
gether. I guess they need 700 patients 
before they can make a determination. 
They think they will be able to make a 
determination that this is a good drug 
by the end of March. That is not quick 
enough. 
If they had more money and more 
push, they would be able to get more 
potential patients, and I would like to 
think get a final determination by the 
end of December. 
So I am calling on my colleagues in 
Congress, as well as the NIH and the 
CDC, to highlight fenofibrate. It is also 
known as Tricor. It has been around a 
long time without dangerous side ef-
fects. Maybe there will be side effects 
with COVID, but there wasn’t dan-
gerous side effects otherwise. It has 
been used by millions of people. I am 
going to be circulating a letter, hoping 
that the administration wakes up and 
does something and does something 
quickly. 
And by the way, this doesn’t only 
cure it, but one of the underpublicized 
problems with COVID is that if you get 
it, it can result in long-lasting prob-
lems, problems to your lungs, problems 
to your organs. It appears, tentatively, 
that fenofibrate will clear up those 
problems quicker and not as many peo-
ple will have those problems. 
I am afraid from what I read that 
COVID is going to be around a long 
time. I know people who have gotten it 
after being vaccinated; not as bad, I 
guess, but they have gotten it. So 
again, I hope that this institution 
moves, and I hope the administration 
moves and hope we can move at warp 
speed and get a final determination on 
fenofibrate by the end of December. 
I would also like to address, given 
what has happened over the last week, 
what I believe is the biggest crisis fac-
ing the country today, and that is the 
problem at the southern border. 
The numbers are well known. Last 
July 8,000 people crossing the border, 
staying in the country. This year, 
105,000, and a lot of people think that is 
a low number. The increase, the per-
centage increase wasn’t quite as great 
in August. But, again, it was a substan-
tial increase at a time of year where it 
is very hot and normally people aren’t 
crossing the border. 
We know the effects. I also don’t 
think it has been as publicized as it 
should be. The huge number of people 
who are dying of illegal drugs, clearing 
90,000 in a year for the first time in this 
country. When I first got this job, 
45,000 a year was a lot. Every politician 
had to say we wanted to do something 
to fight illegal drug use. 
Now that we have fentanyl, an espe-
cially dangerous drug, we have more 
than doubled the number of people 
dying. Politicians barely talk about it. 
But obviously that situation has been 
exacerbated at the southern border. 
My local sheriffs are saying, ‘‘Glenn, 
why aren’t they doing anything to stop 
this coming across the southern bor-
der?’’ Think of all the families, the 
people who have died from illegal drug 
use. 
You think of all the humanitarian 
problems in addition to the huge finan-
cial impact this is going to have on 
America. 
I have been down at the border look-
ing at the little children in pens, under 
8 years old, unaccompanied by parents, 
staying there. What is going to become 
of these children? Apparently we don’t 
care. We continue to let the system go 
on. We continue to allow the word go 
out around the world, not just Central 
America, but South America, Asia, ev-
erywhere, Russia, Cuba, Haiti, more 
and more people coming in this coun-
try. And every day we don’t do some-
thing, the word gets out and the num-
ber continues to go up. 
But what I would like to address is 
how have some Members—I hope not 
that many. But currently the reconcili-
ation bill that is under consideration, 
you read about it in the paper, how do 
they respond? Do they respond with 
more Border Patrol agents? No, we are 
going to keep the Border Patrol under-
staffed. 
Do they respond with a wall? Which 
whenever anybody thinks about it, 
whenever I am on the border talking to 
local law enforcement, talking to the 
Border Patrol, all thought the wall was 
a good idea. No, we are not going to re-
spond that way. 
We are going to look at the crisis and 
change immigration law to dramati-
cally increase the number of people 
coming here, whether it is increasing 
the number of green cards, increasing 
chain migration. Right now, and some-
thing that I think would end the 
United States as we know it, if this 
reconciliation bill passes, it will result 
in a dramatic increase in immigration. 
So instead of doing what anybody 
with an ounce of common sense would 
say, and let’s hire more Border Patrol 
agents for the border, we go the other 
way and say we don’t have enough peo-
ple in this country. We are near record 
levels of the number of current Ameri-
cans who have been born abroad. Immi-
grants are fine. I think in 2018 we swore 
in, I believe, 830,000 new citizens. 
But to respond to the crisis at the 
border, all the Haitians being let in, all 
the people from around the world to 
say let’s change immigration law and 
let’s dramatically increase the number 
of people who are coming here legally, 
to boot, is just crazy. 
It is unfair to all the people who have 
done things right. And it is up to us to 
make sure that in the future, people 
who come here have their years in 
doing jobs, are appropriately vetted, 
and make sure they are good citizens. 
Not to slap dash say, as scandalous as 
things are at the border, let’s let in a 
lot of new people here as chain migra-
tion relatives or that many more green 
cards as well. 
So I beg this body to wake up. I beg 
the press corps to wake up as far as 
what is going on at the border, as well 
as what is going on in the reconcili-
ation bill, and let the American public 
know what is going on. 
I realize that the reconciliation bill 
is long and complicated. We can’t cover 
it all. But at least the American public 
ought to know what we are voting on 
before we destroy America. In addition 
to the generosity that is in the bill as 
well that further serves as a carrot to 
bring people here. 
We have a provision in there to give 
free Pell grants, free scholarships to 
people who are coming here illegally. 
Which, of course, will further encour-
age more people to come here. I still 
find that hard to believe. That if that 
bill passes as is, the average middle- 
class American will be expected to owe 
$20,000, $40,000, $50,000 in debt and may 
or may not get something available at 
the university. But if you show up at 
the southern border because you don’t 
have a lot of money and are considered 
poor, you will get free college. I mean, 
no wonder people are coming here when 
they see the type of bills that our Con-
gress propose. 
But above all, the other provisions 
are going to result in huge increases in 
immigration, and I beg the press corps 
to cover that. 
I would like to thank you for giving 
me this time to address these two prob-
lems, and I yield back the balance of 
my time.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, accept our praise and 
thanksgiving. You have been better to 
us than we deserve, for Your goodness

Your faithfulness. 
Lord, increase the faith of our law-
makers. Inspire them to believe that 
You can empower them to succeed in 
their striving to keep our Nation 
strong. Fill them with reverential awe

tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Karen Erika 
Donfried, of the District of Columbia, 
to be an Assistant Secretary of State 
(European Affairs and Eurasian Af-
fairs). 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, Senate Democrats blocked a 
vote on a clean government funding 
piece of legislation. Senator SHELBY 
and I put forward legislation that could 
pass the Senate easily and keep the 
government open. We were ready to 
avoid a shutdown, get urgent relief to 
Louisiana, help vetted Afghans who 
helped America, and continue sup-
porting Israel’s Iron Dome, which saves 
innocent lives. 
Senate Republicans were ready, and 
House Democratic leaders say they will 
act on whatever CR we send them. But 
Democrats blocked the Senate from 
even considering our legislation. In-
stead, the Democratic leader held a 
vote that he knew would fail on a bill 
he knew was a nonstarter—game-play-
ing instead of governing. 
So look, Mr. President, for more than 
2 months—2 months—Republicans have 
explained that the unified Democratic 
Party government will not get bipar-
tisan support for a debt limit hike 
while they write a partisan taxing-and- 
spending spree behind closed doors. It 
is as simple as that. 
Bipartisanship isn’t a light switch 
that Democrats can switch on when 
they need to borrow money and flip off 
when they want to spend money. If 
Democrats want to use fast-track, 
party-line procedures to ram through 
trillions more in inflationary social-
ism, they will have to use the same 
tools to handle the debt limit. They 
have known this for more than 2 
months. I made it perfectly clear 2 
months ago. 
The debt suspension that expired in 
August covered all the debt that had 
been actually accumulated by that 
date. Let me say that again. The debt 
suspension that expired in August cov-
ered all the debt that had been accu-
mulated by that date. This is an argu-
ment not about the past but about the 
future, a future that Democrats have 
willfully decided they want to own on a 
party-line basis. 
There is no constant tradition that 
says one-party governments get bipar-
tisan help with the debt limit. That 
has been said over and over by the 
press, by the Democrats. Let me make 
it clear. There is no constant tradition 
that says one-party governments get 
bipartisan help with the debt limit. 
Just between 2003 and 2010, there 
were five—five—occasions when the 
party in power had to get a debt limit 
hike through the Senate by them-
selves—five 
times. 
Interestingly 
enough, then-Senators Biden and SCHU-
MER voted no on raising the debt limit 
under President Bush 43 and made the 
united Republican government do it by 
themselves. 
So, look, it is time for our Demo-
cratic colleagues to stop dragging their 
heels and get moving. They have had 
more than 2 months to accept it. Sec-
retary Yellen just announced a new es-
timate that action on the debt limit 
may be necessary as early as October 
18. Democrats will need to handle the 
debt limit before then.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6712 
September 28, 2021 
But Democrats in Congress don’t 
seem to be acting with any urgency. 
The Senate spends day after day on 
midlevel nominations, and our col-
leagues spend all their time in back-
room talks over partisan plans while 
their basic duties sit here in limbo. So 
far, 
Democrats’ 
partisan 
ambitions 
have taken precedence over basic gov-
ernance. That needs to change. Accord-
ing to their own Treasury Secretary, 
they have a few weeks to finally get 
moving. 
BUDGET 
Mr. President, now, on a related mat-
ter, while Washington Democrats ne-
glect basic governance, they are still 
trying to write another reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree behind closed 
doors. Many details are still fuzzy, but 
one basic truth is very clear: Their far- 
left wish list will hurt families and 
help China—new pain and new burdens 
for American families, and new advan-
tages for competitors like China. 
Take, for example, the Democrats’ 
radical anti-energy agenda that is 
downstream from the Green New Deal. 
This sprawling plan for more Wash-
ington intrusion into families’ every-
day lives is set to upend the reliable 
and affordable domestic energy that 
literally drives our country. The Demo-
crats’ effort to enforce elite liberal 
fashions would directly target the jobs 
and the industries that support some of 
the hardest working blue-collar com-
munities in our country. 
Some families would lose their liveli-
hoods altogether. Many more would 
face higher heating bills, higher elec-
tric bills, and higher prices to put gas 
in their cars. Democrats want to tear a 
big hole in Americans’ wallets, right 
where they can least afford it. 
Right now, as we speak, many of our 
allies in Europe are preparing for 
major energy disruption this coming 
winter. Here are a few recent headlines: 
Europeans brace for hard winter as energy 
price surge hits households. 
Empty shelves, gasoline shortages and sky- 
high energy prices? Britain is facing a ‘dif-
ficult winter.’ 
Germans’ Green Energy Resolve Faces 
Pain in Post-Election Winter. 
And from just yesterday: 
Europe’s Energy Crisis Is Coming for the 
Rest of the World, Too. 
This is no time for America to de-
clare war on our own independence, on 
the affordable forms of energy that 
power our country. The rest of the 
world is battening down the hatches 
for a global natural gas crunch that 
could leave entire countries rationing 
winter heat, and President Biden wants 
to let radical progressives declare war 
on American fossil fuels? Really? Is 
this a joke? 
The latest taxing-and-spending spree 
would open multiple new fronts in the 
Big Government war on fossil fuels. It 
would make our electricity grid more 
like California’s: higher costs, less reli-
ability, and more blackouts. It would 
slap countless new costs and fees on do-
mestic production and ban important 
prospects for U.S. drilling. It would 
double down on the Obama administra-
tion’s ham-fisted effort to police emis-
sions that was so legally bizarre it 
couldn’t get past the Supreme Court. 
American 
families 
and 
American 
workers benefit from energy that is af-
fordable and abundant. Washington 
Democrats are pursuing far-left poli-
cies that would reduce supply and jack 
up prices. 
So Democrats’ plans would have 
American families hurting badly, but it 
is not even like all this sacrifice would 
buy us some big national advantage. It 
is just the opposite. Their proposals 
would be a huge gift—a huge gift—to 
adversaries like Russia and China. 
They would set the United States back 
on the global stage. 
To give just one example, the Demo-
crats are drafting blunt mandates for 
more solar panels. Somebody should 
tell our colleagues that China cur-
rently supplies about three-quarters of 
the world’s solar panels. They have 
also largely cornered the market on 
some of the necessary raw materials 
and critical minerals. 
So, look, we are going to borrow 
money from China to send a windfall 
right back to Chinese miners and man-
ufacturers? Is that the master plan? I 
am not sure any of these ideas have re-
ceived more than 5 minutes of thought, 
but in a matter of days they want to 
turn all these hair-brained schemes ac-
tually into law, and the Chinese solar 
bailout is just one example. 
Let’s look at the big picture. Coun-
tries that wish us harm will be thrilled 
to see America make ourselves less 
competitive and more reliant on im-
ports. They will go roaring by us, in-
creasing their prosperity and emis-
sions, no matter what we do. It hurts 
families. It helps China. 
A war on American energy just as the 
rest of the world is steeling for short-
ages—this is just one piece of the 
Democrats’ reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree, along with historic tax 
hikes, more intrusion into family lives, 
and new IRS snooping in every citizen 
transaction over a few hundred dol-
lars—hurting 
families 
and 
helping 
China. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
last night was a low point in the recent 
history of this Chamber. With the gov-
ernment shutdown only days away and 
a default crisis coming in a matter of 
weeks, the Senate was faced with a 
simple and urgent question: Shall the 
Members of this Chamber allow the 
Federal Government to pay its debt 
and stay open, or will its Members ac-
celerate our country toward a shut-
down and a first-ever default? 
Yesterday, we got our answer. Repub-
licans 
voted 
unanimously—unani-
mously—to block legislation to keep 
the government open and prevent an 
unnecessary default on our debt. 
Republicans are now the official 
party of default, the party that says 
America doesn’t pay its debts; the 
party that runs up the balance on the 
credit card, receives an invoice in the 
mail, and sends the bill straight to the 
shredder. 
No average family could get away 
with what the Republicans are trying 
to do; that is for sure. But Republicans 
here shrug their shoulders and say: We 
incurred the debt, but we don’t have to 
pay it. Republicans would let the coun-
try default for the first time in history, 
and it will be the American people who 
pay the price. 
Now, 
Republicans 
have 
said 
for 
weeks—for 
weeks—that 
the 
United 
States must never be allowed to de-
fault. They said the debt ceiling, of 
course, needed to be raised. They said 
to do so otherwise was to play with 
fire. But when given the chance to ac-
tually put the fire out, Republicans 
chose to spray it with gasoline instead. 
And now our country is staring down 
the barrel of two Republican-manufac-
tured crises: a government shutdown 
and a default on the national debt. 
But, fortunately, there is an easy 
way to stave off disaster. Last night, 
the Republican leader—I believe he did 
again this morning—last night and this 
morning, the Republican leader cited 
an example from the 2000s, during 
which Republicans held unified control 
of government and provided the votes 
to increase the debt limit. The Repub-
lican leader said that example was ‘‘ex-
actly the situation we are in now.’’ 
What Leader MCCONNELL
conven-
iently left out is that back then, there 
was a consent agreement, requested by 
the Republican majority leader, that 
cleared the path for the Senate to vote 
to increase the debt limit at a majority 
threshold—only 
one 
party—allowing 
the minority party to vote no but also 
preventing a catastrophic default. 
Let me be clear: I am still of the be-
lief that addressing the debt limit, 
which includes debts incurred by both 
parties, should be done in a bipartisan 
way. But let’s see if Leader MCCONNELL 
truly wants what he is asking for, truly 
wants what he favorably looked upon 
as happening in the early 2000s to allow 
to happen again. 
Later this afternoon, I will ask unan-
imous consent for the Senate to hold a 
vote to increase the debt limit at a ma-
jority threshold. In other words, we 
would get consent that you only need 
50 votes, not 60, on this vote to increase 
the debt limit. And that is what hap-
pened in the past. 
It would be very similar to the proc-
ess that Leader MCCONNELL cited yes-
terday, favorably, which allowed for

the debt limit to be increased without 
the minority party providing any of 
the votes needed to do so. 
So if Republicans want to abscond 
from their responsibilities, not vote to 
pay the debt they incurred, so be it. 
That is a bad thing. It is a bad prece-
dent. But this is the way out. It is a 
way out. It is a straightforward propo-
sition: If Republicans really want to 
see the debt ceiling raised without pro-
viding a single vote, I am prepared to 
hold that vote. I can’t imagine the Re-
publican leader would object to his own 
request—his own request. 
DEBT LIMIT 
Now, taking a step back, Mr. Presi-
dent, we need to remember we didn’t 
need to be in this position at all. We 
could have been well on our way to re-
solving these avoidable crises last 
night. The debt ceiling has been raised 
80 times over the past 60 years under 
both Democratic and Republican Presi-
dents, under both unified and divided 
government. 
Ten years ago, Republican opposition 
to extending the debt ceiling was con-
sidered a fringe, a radical idea. The Re-
publican Speaker at the time called 
the notion of holding the debt ceiling 
hostage to political ends ‘‘insanity.’’ 
The Republican leader himself 2 
years ago said we needed to raise the 
debt ceiling because ‘‘America can’t 
default,’’ otherwise that would be a dis-
aster. His words. 
Well, after last night, it is clear ‘‘in-
sanity’’ and ‘‘disaster’’ are now the Re-
publican Party line, and it is endan-
gering the very bedrock upon which 
both our economic viability and finan-
cial credibility stand. 
I hope that our Republican col-
leagues can walk us back from the 
ledge in a few hours, but it is a sad 
state of affairs to see one of America’s 
two major political parties so casually, 
so gleefully playing with the liveli-
hoods of tens of millions of Americans, 
all for basically a cheap political goal. 
Democrats, meanwhile, are not going 
to abscond from these core responsibil-
ities. Keeping the government open and 
preventing default is vital to our coun-
try’s future, and Democrats are going 
to make sure we do not lapse on either, 
in spite of the dangerous path Repub-
licans have chosen to take us on. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
BUDGET 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
glad that the Democratic leader came 
to the floor after the Republican lead-
er. He certainly clarified some of the 
statements that were made by Senator 
MCCONNELL and brought a dose of re-
ality into the picture. I listened care-
fully to Senator MCCONNELL’s speech, 
and I was waiting for one word. I knew 
he would say it at some point, and yet 
I don’t think he did. I might have 
missed it, but I don’t think he ever 
used 
the 
word 
‘‘filibuster’’—‘‘fili-
buster,’’ the requirement of 60 votes to 
proceed with the business of the Sen-
ate. 
The reason why that is essential is 
the Democrats are prepared to accept 
the responsibility of funding the gov-
ernment and dealing with our national 
debt, acknowledging our debt ceiling. 
And if the Republicans don’t care to be 
part of that conversation—or to engage 
in it, that is their wish—that is what 
they can have. But Senator MCCONNELL 
has put in a filibuster, a requirement of 
60 votes, which makes it literally im-
possible for the Democrats on their 
own to accept their responsibility. He 
didn’t mention that the entire time. 
I think we have reached a new low 
point in the U.S. Senate, where the Re-
publican leader and his followers, to a 
person, are prepared to jeopardize the 
economy of the United States for pure-
ly political reasons. We know that this 
filibuster means we need Republican 
votes to move this measure. And he has 
made it quite clear that he won’t give 
those votes, at least as of yesterday. I 
can only hope that Republican Sen-
ators going home, maybe this weekend, 
hearing from their constituents and 
businesses, will have second thoughts 
about this and accept that bipartisan 
responsibility that we all face. 
There is a second you had to listen 
very carefully to catch with Senator 
MCCONNELL’s opening statement. He 
went on to say at great length that the 
last time we passed a debt ceiling ex-
tension was in August. And, he said, in-
cidentally, all the spending leading up 
to August was covered by that debt 
ceiling. Well, that may have been true. 
What did he fail to tell us? There was 
another bill that he voted for, Trump 
supported, the Republicans supported, 
and the Democrats voted for, too, in 
December for $900 billion in spending. 
That wasn’t covered by the earlier Au-
gust debt ceiling. He knows that. So to 
say all the debt of the Trump adminis-
tration has been taken care of just 
isn’t the fact. And I am glad we have a 
chance to clarify that. 
He seems to think that we are going 
to ‘‘hurt families and help China’’ if we 
press forward with the reconciliation 
bill. Does it hurt families to find an af-
fordable way to have quality daycare 
for their kids? I don’t think so. Does it 
hurt families when children get a 
chance for pre-K education so they are 
ready for school when the day comes? 
Does it hurt families when we extend 
education from K–12 to K–14 and say to 
our community colleges, We are going 
to give you a mission: Prepare the 
workforce for the 21st century? Give 
these Americans the skills they need 
for a good paycheck and a home and a 
family and a future. 
According to the Senator from Ken-
tucky, that hurts American families. I 
think he is just flatout wrong. It helps 
them in critical ways. It really ad-
dresses expenses and challenges they 
face and need a helping hand to suc-
ceed. 
And in terms of helping China, a 
competitive American workforce, in-
vestment in research and innovation 
does not help China. If we invest in this 
country, in its people and its ideas, we 
have always succeeded and led the 
world. 
So I disagree with the Senator from 
Kentucky completely. His approach— 
tax breaks for the wealthiest Ameri-
cans, corporations that, frankly, can 
escape 
any 
tax 
liability—hasn’t 
worked. And it won’t work. It is fun-
damentally unfair, and it fails to in-
vest in the people that need it the 
most: working families, middle-income 
families, children and their future. 
(Mr. PADILLA assumed the Chair.) 
IMMIGRATION 
Mr. President, coincidentally, last 
Friday, you and I made a trip to Chi-
cago. 
Senator PADILLA, as chairman of the 
Immigration Subcommittee of Judici-
ary, joined me in visiting one of the 
most amazing neighborhoods in the 
city. We spent the day in Little Vil-
lage, a neighborhood in the southwest 
part of the city known as the ‘‘Mexican 
Capital of the Midwest. 
During our visit, we walked down 
26th Street, the commercial heart of 
Little Village. It is lined with more 
than 100 family-owned shops and res-
taurants. People travel from all over 
the country to try their homemade 
tamales, stop for their quincean˜ era 
dresses, and experience a little slice of 
Mexico right here in America. 
Families who own the businesses on 
26th Street are proof that the Amer-
ican dream is alive and well. 
Remember La Chiquita Grocery? I 
think that the founder—I guess it was 
almost 35 years ago—took the venture 
of opening a grocery store and now has 
seven or eight of them in the region. 
And they are so proud of their anchor 
store that we were guests in, to show 
us all the things available to folks in 
the neighborhood. 
Whether these folks arrived in our 
country a few years ago or a few gen-
erations ago, these families contribute 
to the economic vitality of the city of 
Chicago every day. Little Village, that 
we visited, is a major economic engine 
in Chicago. That 2-mile stretch of 26th 
Street is the second highest grossing 
shopping district in all of Chicago. And 
those family-run businesses generate 
nearly $1 billion in sales each year. 
Bilingual communities like Little 
Village 
make 
America 
richer 
and 
stronger, culturally and economically. 
They are living proof that immigrants 
are still an essential part of America’s 
future. And there are millions of people 
who have been contributing to our 
economy and our communities for 
years. But they have been left behind 
by our broken immigration system. 
That is exactly what the Presiding 
Officer and I, along with many of our 
colleagues in the Democratic caucus— 
that is exactly what we are trying to 
include as an immigration reform in 
the Build Back Better package that 
will come before the Senate in the 
coming days. 
Let me tell you about one of these 
immigrants that we are focused on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6714 
September 28, 2021 
Roughly 10 miles south of where Sen-
ator PADILLA and I toured Little Vil-
lage, there is a trauma center, Advo-
cate Christ Medical Center. It is one of 
the busiest in Chicago’s South Side. 
One of the doctors who recently com-
pleted his residency in that trauma 
center is Dr. Manuel Bernal Mejia. 
During this pandemic, Dr. Bernal has 
been saving lives every day in the 
emergency 
room. 
He 
cared 
for 
Chicagoans at all stages of life, from 
delivering babies to providing comfort 
to patients during their last moments. 
And he has cared for more COVID pa-
tients than he can count. 
It is in our country that Dr. Bernal 
works every day to take care of our 
friends and loved ones; it is in our 
country that Dr. Bernal graduated 
from college and medical school; and it 
is in our country that Dr. Bernal has 
lived since he was 2 years old. 
Despite that, Dr. Bernal, who is now 
an emergency room physician in near-
by Rockford, has still been left behind 
by our broken immigration system. 
And there are thousands more just like 
him. 
According to the definition estab-
lished by former President Trump, 
there are more than 200,000 DACA re-
cipients that have served as ‘‘essential 
critical infrastructure workers’’ during 
the pandemic. That includes more than 
40,000 
healthcare workers like Dr. 
Bernal. Some of them work in emer-
gency rooms like him and others as 
nurses, paramedics, respiratory thera-
pists. 
So let’s ask a basic question when it 
comes to immigration. Would America 
be better? Would Illinois be better? 
Would Chicago be better without Dr. 
Bernal? All of the Dreamers who are 
working every day to save American 
lives in our hospitals? I don’t think so. 
For Dreamers like Dr. Bernal, DACA 
has been a lifeline. It has given them a 
chance to give back to the only home 
they have ever known. But we all know 
DACA is not a permanent solution. The 
reality is, Dreamers have been stand-
ing on shaky ground for far too long. 
These young people are the best. 
They defend us as members of our mili-
tary, care for our parents and family 
members as home health aides, and 
they teach our children in school. But 
because Congress has failed to fix our 
broken immigration system, Dreamers 
with DACA can only plan their lives in 
2-year increments. And every day, they 
live in fear that the rug is going to be 
pulled out from under them at any mo-
ment. It happened under President 
Trump. He tried to eliminate the pro-
gram. It was finally saved at the high-
est Court in the land across the street, 
in the Supreme Court. 
Dreamers and immigrants like them, 
who give everything they can to our 
country, deserve a path to legal status. 
The fact is, their future is our future. 
As I mentioned, the budget reconcili-
ation package the Senate is expected 
to vote on soon contains President 
Biden’s Build Back Better Plan, a blue-
print for our Nation to mount an en-
during economic recovery. 
The proposals included in that plan 
would supercharge our economy by 
cutting taxes for working families; 
making 
childcare, 
healthcare, 
and 
transportation more affordable; pro-
viding a path to legal status for un-
documented immigrants. 
Let me say that another way. Immi-
gration reform would drive our Na-
tion’s economic recovery for years to 
come. A pathway to legal status for 
Dreamers, TPS recipients, and essen-
tial workers could boost our Nation’s 
GPD by $1.5 trillion over the next 10 
years—$1.5 trillion. 
Additionally, a path to legalization 
could create 400,000 new jobs and in-
crease every American’s annual wage 
by an estimated $600. How can that be? 
Putting these immigrants to work on 
the payroll, how could that help other 
people? Because we have a dynamic 
economy, and what we saw on 26th 
Street in Chicago can be replicated 
over and over again if these new immi-
grants are given a chance to work 
hard, as they all do, show their skills, 
and build the economy around them. 
Our Nation is leaving billions, if not 
trillions, of dollars on the table by fail-
ing to fix our broken immigration sys-
tem. 
Earlier this month, the White House 
published a report that found that pro-
viding a path to permanent legal status 
would ‘‘allow . . . currently unauthor-
ized immigrants to pursue and accept 
jobs for which their skills are well-suit-
ed.’’ Many of these immigrants are of 
prime working age, which means they 
could help grow our Nation’s tax base 
for the foreseeable future. That is 
money that can go towards shoring up 
Social Security, Medicare, and funding 
our Nation’s priorities. In fact, leading 
economists have argued that America 
needs immigrants to keep these pro-
grams solvent. 
In the words of Mark Zandi, Moody’s 
chief economist, the United States is 
‘‘not going to be able to address our fis-
cal problems . . . if we don’t change 
our policy with regard to immigra-
tion.’’ He is not alone. Other econo-
mists 
agree. 
Douglas 
Holtz-Eakin, 
president of the right-leaning Amer-
ican Action Forum, has argued that, in 
the absence of immigration, America 
will ‘‘shrink in population . . . become 
older, and . . . become less important 
on the world stage.’’ 
With the Build Back Better plan, this 
Senate is finally taking up the impor-
tant work investing in America’s fu-
ture. That means building railroads 
and transit networks that will connect 
communities and providing funding for 
high-quality childcare so every parent 
can have a safe place to leave their 
child during the workday. It also 
means providing immigrant families 
the stable footing they need to con-
tribute to our future. 
For these families, make no mistake, 
America is home. Every day, they help 
to make our communities better and 
our economy stronger. That is the case 
we plan on making to the Senate Par-
liamentarian once again. This is the 
first opportunity we have had in a 
long, long time to begin building an 
immigration system that works for 
America. And for our own sake, I hope 
we can get it done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, last 
night’s vote was an exercise in futility, 
as Democrats knew would be the case. 
For months now, Republicans have 
made it clear that we will not help 
Democrats raise our Nation’s debt 
limit to finance Democrats’ partisan 
tax-and-spending spree. If Democrats 
want to pass a massive, partisan tax- 
and-spending bill without Republican 
input, they can raise the debt limit 
without Republican input. 
Democrats, of course, have com-
plained they can’t raise the debt limit 
by themselves. The truth is that they 
don’t want to do it by themselves. 
Democrats want the credit for their so-
cial policies and the government hand-
outs they are planning, but they don’t 
want to own the pricetag. 
Democrats are talking about engag-
ing in a wild, reckless spending spree 
that will worsen our inflation problem, 
threaten economic growth, and sub-
stantially increase the government’s 
control over Americans’ lives. Repub-
licans can’t support that kind of legis-
lation, and we are not going to help 
Democrats increase the credit card 
limit to pay for it. If the Democrats 
want to raise the debt limit, they have 
to do it by themselves. 
I have come down to the floor more 
than once to talk about the reckless 
spending and the massive tax hikes the 
Democrats are planning. I could spend 
the rest of my time here on the floor 
today talking about the irresponsible 
amount of money Democrats want to 
spend and the tax hikes they are pro-
posing, but today, I want to look at 
things a little differently. 
Last week, House Speaker PELOSI 
had this to say in reference to the 
Democrats’ $3.5 trillion spending bill. 
She said: 
It’s not about a price tag. It’s about values. 
It’s not about a price tag. It’s about values. 
Mr. President, she is partially right 
because while the pricetag does matter, 
this is about more than just the 
pricetag. This is about values and vi-
sions—specifically, 
Republicans’ 
and 
Democrats’ different visions of govern-
ment. 
The Democrats’ bill isn’t just about 
spending money, even though it does 
spend money—a lot of it. It is about a

September 28, 2021 
specific vision of government, one 
where the government is intimately in-
volved in nearly every aspect of your 
life from, to quote the New York Times 
article on the Democrats’ bill, ‘‘cradle 
to grave.’’ 
Someone once said to me that the 
difference between Democrats and Re-
publicans is the Republicans believe in 
less government and more freedom; 
Democrats believe in less freedom and 
more government. I think that is a 
pretty accurate description of what we 
are seeing here. 
Republicans oppose Democrats’ tax- 
and-spending spree because it spends 
an irresponsible amount of money, but 
more than that—more than that—we 
oppose it because it moves us further 
and further away from the American 
idea of limiting government. 
Our Founders established a limited 
government for a reason—because they 
respected individual liberty, and they 
knew that the heavier the hand of gov-
ernment, the less liberty Americans 
would enjoy. That is why our Constitu-
tion is as much about what govern-
ment cannot do as what government 
can do. 
Democrats might protest that they 
are not restricting individual liberty, 
that they are just providing a helping 
hand or redistributing wealth, but 
when you expand the reach of govern-
ment, the diminishment of liberty is 
inevitable. When government gets in-
volved in a new area of life, it rarely, if 
ever, just comes with the benefits; it 
comes in with rules and regulations 
and mandates. 
Take Democrats’ childcare benefit. 
Democrats 
are 
preparing 
to 
offer 
childcare subsidies to parents around 
the country, but it is not as simple as 
just taking some money from the gov-
ernment and going out and purchasing 
childcare because it turns out the 
Democrats are changing decades-old 
childcare funding programs to favor 
secular childcare providers who provide 
care at daycare centers. If you prefer 
to choose a faith-based provider for 
your child, you may be out of luck. 
A 2020 Bipartisan Policy Center sur-
vey found that among parents who 
used center-based childcare, 53 percent 
used a faith-based center—53 percent. 
They reported that they chose these 
providers for a variety of reasons, from 
the quality of the caregivers, to the 
cleanliness of the facility, to the val-
ues of the provider. That number may 
change 
when 
Democrats’ 
tax-and- 
spending plan goes into effect, not be-
cause 
parents 
are 
changing 
their 
childcare preferences but simply be-
cause Democrats have set up their ben-
efit 
to 
favor 
secular 
center-based 
childcare providers. 
With government benefits come gov-
ernment control and government pick-
ing the winners and the losers. Secular 
childcare providers win under Demo-
crats’ massive government expansion; 
faith-based 
providers 
and 
parental 
choice, not so much. Electric vehicle 
manufacturers win; the natural gas and 
biofuels industries, not so much, de-
spite the fact that both have been key 
to producing cleaner American energy. 
Unions win under this bill; Americans 
making charitable donations, not so 
much. Democrats are allowing the 
charitable deduction to expire but add-
ing a new tax break to pay for union 
dues. When government is in charge, 
government dictates your choices and 
picks winners and losers. 
Government also gets a lot more in-
volved with overseeing the details of 
your personal life. Democrats are plan-
ning to add a provision that would 
force banks and credit unions to report 
the details of your financial activity to 
the IRS, including certain deposits, 
withdrawals, and other transactions. 
Democrats are apparently still dis-
cussing the amount that would trigger 
the new reporting requirement, which 
has been proposed at $600 or $10,000, but 
whichever number they settle on, a lot 
of ordinary Americans are going to end 
up having their bank or credit union 
forced to report their private informa-
tion to the IRS. Talk about Big Broth-
er. 
Probably the biggest reason that Re-
publicans believe in limited govern-
ment is because we believe in indi-
vidual liberty, and we know that the 
more government expands into your 
life, the more your choices and lib-
erties are curtailed. But there are 
other reasons that we believe in lim-
ited government. 
One big reason is that we know that 
the Federal Government simply isn’t 
the best way of delivering many serv-
ices. There are some things that the 
Federal Government is well-suited to 
do—handling our national defense, for 
example. If our country is invaded or 
attacked, it is a lot more effective for 
our national military to respond rather 
than for each State to respond on its 
own. But there are a lot of other things 
that are better handled at the State 
level or at a local level or in some 
cases not by government at all. 
Our State government in South Da-
kota is a lot more familiar with the 
needs of South Dakotans than the bu-
reaucrats at Washington Agencies. The 
city government in Sioux Falls or 
Rapid City or Pierre or Box Elder is 
even more familiar with or more able 
to respond to the needs of individual 
residents. That is why a lot of things 
are better handled at the State or local 
level or, as I said, at times not by gov-
ernment at all. 
Big Government is impersonal and 
inflexible. It is not familiar with and 
can’t take into account particular and 
sometimes opposing needs of each 
State or each community. Big Govern-
ment is one-size-fits-all. 
Big Government is also inefficient. 
Anyone who thinks the Federal Gov-
ernment would do a good job running 
Americans’ 
healthcare 
hasn’t 
dealt 
with a Federal Agency very recently. 
Big Government is unaccountable. 
Think about it. If you have a company 
that offers a bad product, what is going 
to happen? People are not going to buy 
your product, and you are probably 
going to go out of business quickly. It 
doesn’t work that way with the Federal 
Government. The Federal Government 
is not going to go out of business be-
cause it isn’t doing a good job deliv-
ering the services that are promised. 
If the government is in charge of 
your healthcare and it isn’t delivering 
quality healthcare, you have little re-
course. Sure, you can try to vote in 
new Members of Congress to reform 
things, but even then, change can take 
a very long time. Real reform of an ex-
isting government program is rare. 
Elimination of a bad government pro-
gram? Even rarer. As Ronald Reagan 
used to say, the nearest thing to eter-
nal life that we will ever see on this 
Earth is a government program. 
I could go on. I could talk about how 
Big Government tends to stifle the in-
novation 
that 
leads 
to 
economic 
growth or ask why Democrats think 
that a group of bureaucrats in Wash-
ington are the best decision makers for 
American families. But I want to touch 
on one other point before I close, and 
that is that Democrats believe in gov-
ernment dependence as the goal. They 
might dispute that characterization, 
but you only have to look at the tax- 
and-spending package that they are 
putting together to know that is their 
vision. 
They envision a future where Ameri-
cans rely on the government for every-
thing from childcare, to education, to 
healthcare, and on and on. That is a vi-
sion 
with 
which 
Republicans 
fun-
damentally disagree. Our vision is not 
a future of government dependence be-
cause government doesn’t bring pros-
perity. Government doesn’t bring the 
American dream. At best, government 
is going to help you survive. It is not 
going to help you thrive. 
Yes, government can be an important 
backstop in difficult situations or na-
tional emergencies, like the COVID cri-
sis, but the goal should always be to 
get people to a place where they don’t 
have to rely on government. Perma-
nent government dependence robs peo-
ple of the purpose and pride that comes 
with work and personal achievement, 
and, as I said, it denies them the oppor-
tunity for prosperity. No one ever be-
came prosperous on government bene-
fits. 
If you asked most Americans what 
the American dream means to them, I 
am pretty sure you would hear things 
like a ‘‘good job,’’ a ‘‘rewarding ca-
reer,’’ the ‘‘chance to pursue my ambi-
tions,’’ or the ‘‘chance to improve my 
circumstances and make life better for 
my children.’’ That is what Americans 
envision, not a future of government 
dependence and government subsidies. 
People are looking to achieve the 
kind of prosperity where they don’t 
need government involvement in every 
aspect of their lives and can choose 
their paths for themselves instead of 
having to follow the rules and regula-
tions that come with government bene-
fits.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6716 
September 28, 2021 
That is a vision that Republicans 
share, and it is what we are committed 
to fighting for on behalf of the Amer-
ican people. That is another reason we 
are committed to maintaining limited 
government, because the bigger gov-
ernment grows, the more that vision of 
opportunity and prosperity shrinks. 
And so Speaker PELOSI is partially 
right. She is wrong to dismiss the bill’s 
pricetag, because it is profoundly—pro-
foundly—irresponsible to mortgage our 
children’s and grandchildren’s futures 
with a massive government spending 
increase, but she is right in that it is 
about values. 
Now, Republicans aren’t opposing 
Democrats’ 
tax-and-spending 
spree 
simply because it spends a lot of 
money, but because it advances a vi-
sion of government with which we pro-
foundly disagree. We don’t believe that 
the American dream is government de-
pendence; we don’t believe in an ever- 
expanding role for the Federal Govern-
ment; and we don’t believe that bu-
reaucrats in Washington are a good 
substitute for the judgment of the 
American people. 
That is why every Republican in the 
Senate will be voting against the 
Democrats’ reckless spending legisla-
tion, not just because it spends too 
much money, but because it fundamen-
tally undermines the American tradi-
tion of liberty and limited government. 
It is about values, and it is about vi-
sions, and Republicans do not share the 
Democrats’ vision of a future of Big 
Government and Big Brother. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that I be able to con-
clude my remarks before the scheduled 
rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to continue the discussion that we 
have been having about the harms of 
Nord Stream 2. 
I will discuss in this speech one of 
the administration’s legal responsibil-
ities, in particular to impose sanctions 
in a way that they are now defying 
those legal responsibilities. 
I do want to note that every day 
brings new evidence of the incoherence 
of President Biden’s sellout and sur-
render to Vladimir Putin. Since we last 
discussed this, elections have occurred 
in Germany and the government of An-
gela Merkel, on whose behalf the Biden 
administration claims to be acting, 
will now be replaced. So the entire sur-
render to Russia by Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS was for nothing. I will 
discuss that further throughout the 
day and throughout the week. 
We have heard repeatedly from my 
Democratic colleagues that my actions 
to block some of President Biden’s 
nominees are unprecedented. That ac-
cusation doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. 
Senators routinely use their preroga-
tives, and, indeed, Democrats regularly 
engaged in massive obstruction over 
months and years of President Trump’s 
nominations. 
What 
isn’t 
unprece-
dented, however, is Joe Biden’s open 
defiance and literal lawlessness in not 
imposing the sanctions mandated by 
multiple laws passed overwhelmingly 
by Congress. 
Right now, I would like to talk about 
one of the laws that the President is 
violating: 
CAATSA—the 
Countering 
America’s Adversaries Through Sanc-
tions Act. Before getting into the de-
tails of Nord Stream 2, I would like to 
note a couple of things about CAATSA. 
First, CAATSA was explicitly de-
signed for the purpose of taking away 
the President’s discretion whether or 
not to impose sanctions on Russia in 
cases where Congress had deemed it 
necessary to mandate them. And sec-
ondly, on that basis, CAATSA passed 
Congress with nearly unanimous sup-
port: 419 to 3 in the House, and 98 to 2 
in the Senate. 
As for the purpose of CAATSA, I 
would like to quote some of my col-
leagues from the other side of the aisle 
who were both clear and celebratory 
about the bill. 
Senator MURPHY, who has been par-
ticularly loquacious in opposition to 
these holes, said about CAATSA: ‘‘It is 
not often that Congress takes away, 
from the president, discretionary pow-
ers on foreign policy.’’ 
Worth remembering. 
Senator SCHUMER, who has also had 
more than a little bit to say on these 
holes, said that CAATSA was necessary 
because of what he described as the 
President’s ‘‘seeming inability to deal 
with the many transgressions of Rus-
sia.’’ 
Gosh, Senator SCHUMER was right. 
We now have a President unwilling and 
unable to deal with, as he put it, the 
‘‘many transgressions of Russia.’’ 
What about Senator MENENDEZ? 
Senator MENENDEZ has stood on this 
floor, including at 4:00 and 5:00 and 6:00 
in the morning, railing about these 
blocks. 
Well, 
what 
did 
he 
say 
about 
CAATSA? 
He said that CAATSA sent ‘‘the most 
powerful message in the world, that 
the United States—Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents—stand to-
gether.’’ 
Those were really fine sentiments. I 
wish they held true when there was a 
Democratic President as much as Sen-
ator MENENDEZ
believed them when 
there was a Republican President. 
And how about Senator DURBIN? 
Senator DURBIN is never lacking an 
opinion on any topic. Here is what he 
said: ‘‘We had to tell them enough is 
enough, and when it came to the sanc-
tions and trusting the president, we ba-
sically said we want to make sure the 
president will not lift these sanctions.’’ 
Well, do you know what? Senator 
MURPHY was right. Senator SCHUMER 
was right. Senator MENENDEZ
was 
right. Senator DURBIN was right. That 
is why Congress came together to pass 
CAATSA, tough legislation to prevent 
a President from doing what Joe Biden 
is doing right now: surrendering to 
Putin, surrendering to Russia, ignoring 
U.S. law, and giving Putin a multibil-
lion-dollar gift. 
And, when my Democratic colleagues 
didn’t believe the Trump administra-
tion was implementing the full breadth 
of 
mandatory 
sanctions 
under 
CAATSA, they made the purpose of 
CAATSA even clearer. 
On January 30, 2018, Senator CARDIN 
led a letter about CAATSA to then- 
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, co-
signed by 21 other Democrats—almost 
half of the caucus. They said that the 
Trump administration’s failure to im-
pose mandatory sanctions ‘‘do not fully 
reflect the clear congressional intent 
described in the legislation . . . We ex-
pect the administration to provide a 
full explanation as to why it has not 
imposed mandatory sanctions’’ under 
several provisions of CAATSA. 
Then, on May 18, 2018, Senator 
MENENDEZ led a letter about CAATSA 
to several inspectors general, cosigned 
by two other Democrats. They said 
that ‘‘[s]everal mandatory provisions 
of the law have not been implemented 
. . . despite strong evidence that ac-
tions taken by or on behalf of the Rus-
sian government are in violation of the 
CAATSA sanctions law.’’ 
In fact, I would like to read more of 
that letter because it is so abundantly 
clear about the purpose of CAATSA: 
In light of the apparent violations and the 
lack of corresponding sanctions actions, we 
are concerned about whether the sanctions 
implementation process within the adminis-
tration is fulfilling CAATSA’s mandate and 
intent. In general, with respect to manda-
tory measures, the President is required to 
make determinations in the event he has es-
tablished that sanctions behavior has taken 
place, and then either impose sanctions or 
exercise a waiver. 
So a binary choice: One or the other. 
That is what of a President is required. 
And do you know what? Senator 
CARDIN and Senator MENENDEZ, well, 
they might have meant it, but they 
didn’t say it: Only Republican Presi-
dents are required to do this. 
They didn’t write that in their let-
ters 
because, 
of 
course, 
CAATSA 
doesn’t say that. What they said is a 
President is required to make that 
choice. The law requires the President 
to make that choice. 
Senator CARDIN was right. Senator 
MENENDEZ was right. And Joe Biden is 
telling them: Go jump in a lake. 
He is telling the U.S. Congress: Go 
jump in a lake. 
He is telling the American people: Go 
jump in a lake. 
He is cutting a deal with Putin, and 
don’t bring no stinkin’ laws to get in 
his way. 
That brings to us Nord Stream 2. One 
of the provisions that my Democratic 
colleagues cited in both of those letters 
was section 228: ‘‘Sanctions with re-
spect to certain transactions with for-
eign sanctions evaders and serious

human rights abusers in the Russian 
federation.’’ 
Section 228 mandates the imposition 
of sanctions on any company that con-
ducts any ‘‘significant transactions,’’ 
including ‘‘deceptive transactions,’’ for 
Russian companies that are already 
sanctioned. 
There is no doubt—zero—that the 
company Nord Stream 2 AG, which is 
the company responsible for the plan-
ning, the construction, and the even-
tual operation of Putin’s Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline, has committed acts that re-
quire the implementation and the im-
position of those mandated sanctions 
under CAATSA 228. 
Indeed, that is one of the many rea-
sons the pipeline was halted for a year, 
and Putin only began building it again 
on January 24 of this year—4 days after 
Joe Biden was sworn in. Because Joe 
Biden has been so weak on this issue, 
because the pipeline exists only as a 
gift from Biden to Putin, this pipeline 
is, in a very real sense, the Biden-Putin 
pipeline. 
We know that the Biden administra-
tion is defying the law, because the 
Biden administration told us so in 
May. The Biden administration sent a 
report to Congress describing how Nord 
Stream 2 AG had conducted deceptive 
transactions for sanctioned Russian 
companies. That is the explicit trigger 
in CAATSA for sanctions, and yet the 
Biden administration has refused to 
meet its obligations under CAATSA, 
and that leads to the reasonable com-
promise that I have offered. 
For several months, I have had in 
place a hold on all State Department 
nominees and on several Treasury De-
partment nominees as well. The reason 
for the hold has been simple—because 
Joe Biden is defying the law and is giv-
ing Vladimir Putin a multibillion-dol-
lar gift that constitutes a generational 
geopolitical blunder that puts billions 
of dollars into the Russian coffers 
every year that Putin will use for mili-
tary aggression against America and 
our allies. Biden’s surrender to Putin 
weakens Europe profoundly. It makes 
Europe dependent on Russia even more 
so for energy and subject to Russia’s 
energy blackmail. And it also, on top 
of that, destroys jobs here in the 
United States. 
For months, I have had in place the 
blanket hold that has caused increas-
ing cries of pain and dismay from our 
Democratic colleagues. Interestingly, 
these same Democratic colleagues all 
agree that what Biden is doing with 
the Biden-Putin pipeline is terrible. Al-
most to a person, the Democrats who 
are complaining about this have de-
nounced Joe Biden for giving Putin 
this multibillion-dollar gift, but they 
say they want to confirm his nominees 
anyway. 
So what I have said is: All right. 
Fine. 
If 
the 
Biden 
administration 
wants to defy the sanctions law that I 
drafted—the Cruz-Shaheen sanctions 
law, it is two different bills that I 
drafted with Senator SHAHEEN, Demo-
crat from New Hampshire. We passed 
into law, overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port from both Houses of Congress. If 
Joe Biden wants to ignore those laws, 
then there is another avenue to resolve 
much of this dispute, which is simply 
to follow the law under CAATSA. 
So I extended an offer to Secretary 
Blinken, to Secretary Yellen, to the 
White House that I would lift my holds 
on every career State nominee and on 
the Treasury nominees where I placed 
holds in exchange for one of two 
things: No. 1, the best outcome would 
be for the Biden administration to ac-
tually implement CAATSA and sanc-
tion Nord Stream 2 AG, to follow the 
law, to do what is mandatory. 
That would be the best outcome. If 
they did so, I would immediately lift 
my holds. 
But, secondly, I get that the White 
House politically has decided they 
want to surrender to Putin on this. My 
understanding is there is an inter-
agency process—the State Department 
argued to do the right thing. The State 
Department argued: Impose the sanc-
tions on Nord Stream 2 AG, stop this 
pipeline, which, by the way, is what 
Tony Blinken sat in my office and 
promised State would do. It is what 
just about every senior nominee to the 
State Department has promised they 
would do. 
State argued to do the right thing, 
but according to public reports, the po-
litical operatives at the White House 
overruled their own State Department. 
They said: Never mind the national se-
curity interests of the United States. 
Never mind protecting America. Never 
mind stopping Putin and Russia. Never 
mind protecting Europe’s energy secu-
rity. Never mind protecting Europe 
from blackmail by Putin. We want to 
surrender 
because 
Angela 
Merkel 
wants us to. 
I talked last week about how a friend 
of mine jokes that the White House po-
litical team sleeps with votive candles 
of Angela Merkel under their beds. 
There is a view in the White House 
that what Merkel wants, Merkel gets, 
even if it is bad for America, bad for 
Germany, bad for Europe, but good for 
Russia. 
Of course, Merkel is on her way out 
now, but they still want to do this sur-
render. And this surrender, by the way, 
if it is completed, will hurt America 
for generations to come—10 years, 20 
years, 30 years from now. 
The next Russian dictator will be en-
riched by Joe Biden’s surrender to 
Putin on the Biden-Putin pipeline. 
The two options: First, after impos-
ing sanctions, they could leave them in 
place. But, secondly, recognizing that 
they don’t want to do it, there is a sec-
ond option I gave them, which is that 
they could impose sanctions under 
CAATSA, but then they could delist 
Nord Stream 2 AG. 
In other words, they could exercise 
the political decision not to impose the 
sanctions. That gives them their pol-
icy—preferred policy outcome. 
What it also does under CAATSA is it 
triggers an automatic congressional 
override vote. 
So I told Secretary Blinken, I told 
Secretary Yellen: It is very easy. If you 
believe in this foolhardy policy of sur-
rendering to Putin, then put your 
money where your mouth is. Follow 
the law, which is clear, unequivocal, 
black letter law. Impose the sanctions. 
And you do have a vehicle. You can 
delist it. The President can make a de-
termination that even though the sanc-
tions are mandatory, he wants to delist 
it. 
But here is what Congress did. In 
CAATSA, it triggered an automatic 
congressional override vote. And what 
I have told the administration is: You 
know what. Whether I win or lose that 
override vote, if you actually follow 
the law in such a way that it triggers 
that vote, I will lift my holds—my 
holds on the career State nominees, my 
holds on the Treasury nominees. You 
have a path. Simply subject yourself to 
congressional oversight. 
Now, it is very clear why they 
haven’t taken this offer, which has 
been in writing for months now. Be-
cause Joe Biden thinks if we had a vote 
in this Senate, he would lose. He 
thinks if we had a vote in the House, he 
would lose. He knows that Republicans 
would vote against him. 
And if Democrats had a modicum of 
consistency, virtually every Democrat 
in this Chamber and the House has 
been unequivocal that the Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline is devastating to U.S. na-
tional security. And so the Biden White 
House doesn’t want to risk members of 
his own party voting against his sur-
render to Russia. So, instead, they defy 
the law. That is an irresponsible course 
of action. 
There is a very reasonable com-
promise on the table, and all of the per-
ils the Democrats are lamenting about 
these holds can be avoided if, if, if Joe 
Biden will simply follow the law, fol-
low CAATSA. The mandatory sanc-
tions that Democrats explained were 
designed to prevent a President from 
doing what Joe Biden is doing right 
now, which is surrendering to Russia. 
There is a reasonable compromise on 
the table. All that is required is for Joe 
Biden to take it. 
I yield the floor.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor to offer some brief remarks 
today in the wake of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee hearing today on the 
evacuation of Afghanistan and the end 
to U.S. troop presence there. I watched 
it with some interest. I watched it 
knowing that three out of four Ameri-
cans support President Biden’s decision 
to bring U.S. troops home from Af-
ghanistan. 
We learned some new things today in 
the hearing. Others were confirmed. 
First, we learned, once again, of the ex-
traordinary bravery and capability of 
our diplomats and our soldiers, who 
worked under incredibly difficult con-
ditions for a period of weeks to airlift 
almost 130,000 individuals out of Af-
ghanistan. That is absolutely remark-
able, especially given, as we heard 
today in testimony, that the goal at 
the outset, in the best case scenario, 
was to get 60 to 70 to 80,000 people out. 
In the end, the United States of Amer-
ica, our military and our diplomats, 
got 130,000 people out. 
We heard, also, about the impossible 
position that President Biden inher-
ited; that there was a commitment 
made to withdraw American troops by 
President Trump but no plan with 
which to do it safely. We heard about 
how the Doha agreement decreased the 
readiness of the Afghan forces, how it 
weakened their position internally. 
We heard about the choice that faced 
President Biden when he came into of-
fice. We heard about the fact that, had 
we chosen to stay, we would have had 
to surge troops; that the Taliban, hav-
ing gotten to the precipice of provin-
cial capitals, would have engaged in a 
level of urban warfare that would have 
required the United States to increase 
our troop presence there in order to be 
able to stand up an effective resistance 
to the Taliban. 
To the extent that Republicans view 
this as a political game and they were 
looking for points to be scored today, I 
guess the one point they feel they 
scored was an admission by the gen-
erals who testified that some of them 
had recommended staying in Afghani-
stan. 
Now, I have tremendous respect for 
our generals. I think they get it right 
more than they get it wrong. They pro-
vide very able advice to the Com-
mander in Chief. But for 20 years, in 
Afghanistan, 
our 
generals 
rec-
ommended staying, in the face of 
mounting evidence, year after year, 
that it was going to be impossible to be 
able to stand up an Afghan military 
that could protect the country and an 
Afghan Government that could govern 
the 
country. 
Our 
generals 
rec-
ommended staying—year after year 
after year, month after month after 
month—despite the fact that many an-
alysts told us that as soon as we left 
and the Taliban took over, the Afghan 
Government and the military would 
fall. 
Now, they did it because our military 
is bred to believe that anything is pos-
sible. It speaks, in some part, to the 
best of American military ethos, the 
idea that there is no obstacle that can-
not be surmounted, that cannot be 
climbed by U.S. forces. But the task 
they were given by President after 
President was one that could not be 
carried out. 
And to simply believe that because 
the general said ‘‘stay another year’’ or 
‘‘stay another 5 years,’’ this Com-
mander in Chief should have listened, 
despite the fact that it had been proven 
that the mission that we were given in 
that country was impossible, is to com-
pound a mistake—an unnecessary mis-
take—that the United States engaged 
in for far, far too long. 
And so my hope is that moving for-
ward, this Congress and this Senate are 
going to engage in real oversight. 
There is no doubt the evacuation could 
have been done better. There is no 
doubt that, in a mission this com-
plicated, the Biden team would have 
done things differently. But the real 
question is, Why did we stay in Afghan-
istan for 10 years too long? Why did we 
keep believing that we could train-up a 
military that would be capable of de-
fending the country? 
It is time that we have a deep inquiry 
in this Senate about the limits of 
American military power overseas and 
how badly misresourced we are when 
we spend 10 to 20 times as much money 
on military power as we do on other 
means of projecting American power. 
It is also important for us to under-
stand the cost of getting bogged down 
in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. It 
is not a coincidence that shortly after 
withdrawing 
from 
Afghanistan, 
we 
were able to announce this new part-
nership with Australia and Britain to 
better protect our mutual interests in 
the Pacific theater. 
It is because, when the entirety of 
the U.S. defense and foreign policy in-
frastructure 
is 
so 
trained 
on 
unwinnable contests in far off places 
like Afghanistan, it doesn’t allow us 
the capacity and the creativity to be 
able to design new systems and new 
structures with which to protect the 
country. 
China celebrated every single year 
that we remain bogged down in Af-
ghanistan. Russia celebrated every sin-
gle year that we doubled down on that 
mistake. Now we have the ability to 
turn our attention to fights that truly 
matter. 
We learned some things in the Armed 
Services Committee today. I think 
what we learned confirms that the de-
cision that President Biden made to 
pull our troops out was the right one. 
It is a decision supported by the Amer-
ican people because it allows this coun-
try, finally, to focus on fights that are 
winnable in reality, not just on paper. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER.

charged equally to both sides.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2868 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, last 
night, Senate Republicans voted unani-
mously to make a default and a shut-
down far more likely and in doing so, 
solidified themselves as the party of 
default, the party that says America 
does not pay its debts. 
Now, despite yesterday’s stunning 
display of obstruction, the fact remains

September 28, 2021 
that we need to raise the debt ceiling, 
and in a few moments, I will offer a 
way forward for us to avoid causing un-
necessary and catastrophic default on 
the debt. 
Over the last 2 days, the Republican 
leader has repeatedly cited an instance 
in the mid-2000s during which Repub-
licans held full control of the govern-
ment and voted by themselves to in-
crease the debt limit. Here is what he 
said: That is ‘‘exactly the same situa-
tion we’re in now.’’ That is ‘‘exactly 
the same situation we’re in now.’’ 
The Senate was able to raise the debt 
ceiling at that time because the then- 
Republican majority leader made a 
consent request to this body that 
cleared the way for the Senate to in-
crease the debt limit by a majority 
threshold instead of requiring 60 votes 
to break a filibuster. The minority 
party, under this agreement, was able 
to vote no, which is what they claim 
they want to do, and the majority 
party was able to approve a debt limit 
extension and prevent a catastrophe. 
So we are proposing the same thing 
today, the same thing the leader cited 
and said the situation is exactly the 
same. Simply allow for a simple major-
ity threshold to raise the debt ceiling 
and avoid this needless catastrophe 
that Republicans have steered us to-
ward. We are simply asking Senator 
MCCONNELL to live by his own example. 
We have given the Republicans what 
they want, and now the ball is in their 
court. Let’s see if Republicans truly 
want what they say they want. We are 
not asking them to vote yes. If Repub-
licans want to vote to not pay the 
debts they helped incur, they can all 
vote no. We are just asking Repub-
licans to get out of the way. Get out of 
the way when you are risking the full 
faith and credit of the United States to 
play a nasty political game. 
We can bring this to a resolution 
today. Using the drawn-out and con-
voluted reconciliation process is far 
too risky—far too risky. Too many 
American families are at stake. Far 
better for us to solve this problem 
right here and right now. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that, at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader following consultation with 
the Republican leader, the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of S. 2868, a 
bill to suspend the debt limit, which 
was introduced earlier today; that 
there be 2 hours for debate equally di-
vided and controlled between the two 
leaders or their designees; that upon 
the use or yielding back of time, the 
bill be considered read a third time and 
the Senate vote on the passage of the 
bill with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Reserving 
the 
right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, my 
colleague wants to discuss precedence 
from a decade ago, but he and his col-
leagues have spent all year boasting 
that what Democrats are doing to the 
country and the economy is completely 
without precedent. I agree. What they 
are trying to do is completely without 
precedent. There is nothing normal— 
nothing 
normal—about 
Democrats 
using reconciliation multiple times to 
blow a $5.5 trillion hole in the deficit 
without a single vote from our side. 
Debt limit increases like the one we 
saw in 2006 were not—I repeat, not— 
precursors to a massive blowout rec-
onciliation package that Republicans 
were just waiting to shove down Demo-
crats’ throats. 
My colleague is trying hard to make 
this complicated. It is actually simple. 
I have said for more than 2 months 
that we will not help this unified 
Democratic government raise the debt 
ceiling. Democrats will not get bipar-
tisan help borrowing money so they 
can immediately blow historic sums on 
a partisan taxing-and-spending spree. 
The Democratic leader knew this re-
quest would fail. There is no chance— 
no chance—the Republican conference 
will go out of our way to help Demo-
crats conserve their time and energy so 
they can resume ramming through par-
tisan socialism as fast as possible. This 
Democratic 
government 
has 
spent 
months boasting about the radical 
transformation 
they 
are 
ramming 
through. They are proud of it. They 
have no standing whatsoever to ask 50 
Republican Senators to make the proc-
ess more convenient. 
When the Democratic leader was re-
cently in the minority, he made us file 
cloture on matters that weren’t one- 
tenth this controversial. We had to in-
voke cloture on nominees who went on 
to be confirmed with literally zero 
votes in opposition. But now the Demo-
cratic leader wants us to skip that step 
on something this controversial? Of 
course, that is not going to happen. 
All year long, Democrats have want-
ed to control government spending all 
on their own. They wanted to be in the 
position they are in right now. They 
requested from the Parliamentarian 
and won extra flexibility to redo rec-
onciliation. So, if Democrats want to 
use fast-tracked, party-line processes 
to spend trillions of dollars and trans-
form the country, they will have to use 
the same tool to raise the debt ceiling. 
Now, here is what Republicans will 
do: For the sake of the full faith and 
credit of our country, I am about to 
propose a different consent, one that 
will allow Democrats to start the budg-
et process they will need to use to raise 
the debt ceiling. Our Democratic col-
leagues will need to do this alone, but 
I will propose an agreement to ensure 
the process can begin as soon as Demo-
crats accept that this is the path they 
need to take. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I ask the 
Senate to modify the request that has 
been made by the majority leader so 
that, in lieu of this proposal, if the 
Budget Committee reports out a 304 
budget resolution with instructions to 
raise the debt limit or is discharged 
from consideration of such resolution, 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the 
majority leader so modify his request? 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, the Repub-
lican leader has offered virtually noth-
ing. He keeps the same risky process in 
place. He is totally doing a 180-degree 
turn from what he has offered time and 
again. The Democrats vote yes without 
any Republican help, but he refuses to 
do that. He refuses to do that. Our pro-
posal is fair. Our proposal is not risky, 
the way the Republican leader’s is, and 
his doesn’t change a darned thing. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the original request? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
DEBT CEILING 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, Sen-
ate Democrats just gave Republicans 
yet another opportunity to do the right 
thing—to make sure the U.S. Govern-
ment pays its bills, like every working 
family in our country does. 
Now, Senate Republicans have ac-
knowledged that, even though default 
would be catastrophic for our economy, 
they would not vote to prevent it—no 
Republican votes or help to prevent an 
economic catastrophe. Now they have 
kicked their brinksmanship up another 
notch by blocking Democrats—Demo-
crats only—from voting to avoid de-
fault with a purely Democratic vote. 
This makes no sense if you truly care 
about our workers, about our families, 
about our hard-won economic recovery. 
It only makes sense if their goal is eco-
nomic sabotage—if they are so willing 
to put politics first that you put the 
American economy on the line. That is, 
apparently, what the Republican Party 
stands for today until proven other-
wise: economic sabotage and politics 
first, no matter who gets hurt. 
This is a disgrace. It is an embarrass-
ment. But it is not going to stop Demo-
crats from fighting to protect our econ-
omy 
from 
the 
devastating 
con-
sequences of default, because let me be 
clear: Republicans may think this is 
some obscure fight right now, but it 
will not be if it hits Americans’ bank 
accounts, and they are fooling them-
selves if they think people won’t know 
who is responsible. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
suspending the debt ceiling is not 
about generating new spending. It is 
about making sure the government can 
pay for our spending. Since 1960, Con-
gress has done this. It has raised the 
debt ceiling approximately 80 times. It 
is not unusual; it is not uncommon; it 
is not unacceptable. What is unaccept-
able is that our colleagues won’t even 
allow us to do it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6720 
September 28, 2021 
The 50 of us are united in this, and I 
say: Where are our Republican col-
leagues? 
They know the fact: A default will 
impact everyone. The government will 
need to decide between sending out So-
cial Security checks, ensuring we keep 
our promises to our vets, and pay-
checks to active military. It is disas-
trous for our economy and small busi-
ness. 
This year, Neil Bradley of the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce said that failing 
to act responsibly and provide an in-
crease in the debt limit would endanger 
our economy. It would cause global 
markets, of course, to lose confidence 
in the full faith and credit of the 
United States. 
The stakes are high. This should not 
be about scoring political points. Our 
families, our workers, our seniors de-
serve better. Democrats are united to 
stand by their side. 
And we say to our Republican col-
leagues: Where are you? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, Rube 
Goldberg was an American sculptor, 
cartoonist, and inventor best known 
for his cartoons that created very com-
plicated machines to do very simple 
tasks. 
Today, we have heard from MITCH 
MCCONNELL that he wants to emulate 
Rube Goldberg and put our entire na-
tional economy at risk by an extraor-
dinarily complicated method to do a 
simple task, and the simple task was 
laid out so clearly in 2006. The minor-
ity leader said we are in exactly the 
same position now as we were then. 
Well, yes. The Republicans asked the 
Democrats to not filibuster so that 
they could raise the debt limit. The ta-
bles are turned. The simple same cour-
tesy takes away the risk to our econ-
omy. 
The risk is great for disaster relief, 
for Medicaid, for payments to our vet-
erans, for payments to our currently 
serving forces; and there are broader 
risks, risks that Mark Zandi has laid 
out, in saying a recession could result 
in the loss of millions of jobs, that it 
could result in the loss of a half a bil-
lion dollars in family wealth, that it 
could be—or $15 trillion in household 
wealth—$15 trillion. 
There are moments when the polit-
ical games have to stop, when the par-
tisan warfare has to stop. The Demo-
crats did what the Republicans sug-
gested in 2006. We also took an alter-
native method that MITCH MCCONNELL 
suggested in the past, which was to let, 
in 2011, the President raise the debt 
ceiling subject to an override by Con-
gress. We have twice worked with the 
Republicans, at their request, for a 
simple method. This is not the moment 
for a Rube Goldberg disaster with the 
wealth and health of Americans at 
risk. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that, following my 
remarks, Senator LANKFORD and Sen-
ator SCOTT of South Carolina be recog-
nized to speak and to complete their 
remarks prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the de-
bate on President Biden’s massive plan 
to expand social programs has focused 
primarily on its enormous cost. Re-
markably, little attention has been 
paid to the content of those policy 
changes. Yet the expensive entitlement 
programs the administration is pro-
posing would have profound implica-
tions for people’s lives and for the val-
ues that are among the pillars of our 
society, for they would break the con-
nection between work and a brighter 
future. 
From antiquity to our time, great 
thinkers have observed that work is 
about more than just putting food on 
the table, important though that is; it 
has a profound value that enables peo-
ple to build lives of self-reliance and 
meaning. 
As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., once 
said: 
No work is insignificant. All labor that up-
lifts humanity has dignity. 
Under the President’s plan, assist-
ance checks sent from Washington 
would have no requirement that a re-
cipient work, or pursue education or 
training, or participate in programs to 
remove barriers that prevent him or 
her from working. These unconditioned 
checks would sever the link between 
government assistance and work, edu-
cation, or other requirements. No one 
would help a family identify obstacles 
to a better life. In essence, the Biden 
administration 
would 
reverse 
the 
pledge and reality of President Clin-
ton’s reforms when he promised to 
‘‘end welfare as we know it.’’ 
Robert Doar, who oversaw assistance 
programs both for New York Governor 
George Pataki and New York City 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, described 
what has long been a bipartisan con-
sensus. He said: 
. . . the way to help people escape poverty 
is through a combination of work and gov-
ernment aid—not work alone and not gov-
ernment aid alone. But the two together. 
Why is that combination so powerful 
and so successful? 
Government assistance provides a 
hand up and aids families who are 
struggling to overcome barriers to a 
better life. Work not only provides the 
economic pathway out of poverty, 
but—also equally important—imparts 
dignity, self-reliance, and confidence. 
It allows people to provide for their 
own families. It instills a sense of be-
longing and pride. It strengthens our 
communities. 
Let me give you two examples. 
I first met Adais when she was en-
rolled in the Federal Job Corps pro-
gram in Limestone, ME. As a teenager, 
she had been homeless and wanted to 
get as far away as possible from the 
terrible circumstances in her life—thus 
her choice of the Job Corps in northern 
Maine. After completing this program 
in Limestone, Adais earned her degree 
in nursing from Husson University in 
Bangor. Today, due to her own perse-
verance, hard work, and government 
support during a very difficult time, 
she has a good life working as a nurse 
and providing for her three sons. She 
can take much pride in the life that 
she has built for herself and her family. 
The second example involves women 
I met at the Aroostook County Com-
munity Action Program. They have 
benefited from a holistic approach to 
poverty, one that focuses on the needs 
of both the children and their parents— 
a two-generation-together approach— 
in order to end intergenerational pov-
erty. 
This two-generation approach identi-
fies obstacles to work and financial 
independence, and then provides the 
necessary coaching and supports to 
help parents succeed in their goals 
while also meeting the needs of their 
children. 
These mothers recounted to me with 
great pride their very moving stories of 
climbing the economic ladder out of 
poverty and into the workforce, pro-
viding a much better life for them-
selves and their children. 
What these stories have in common 
is the dignity of work. As Stephen 
Hawking observed, ‘‘Work gives you 
meaning and purpose.’’ Securing the 
skills and support to get good jobs 
changed the lives of these parents and 
the lives of their children. 
Now, let me be clear that I have sup-
ported providing additional help to as-
sist low-income working families. For 
example, I worked with Senator RUBIO 
to successfully double the child tax 
credit and expand its refundable por-
tion as part of the 2017 tax reform act, 
but this credit was tied to work until 
the Biden administration changed the 
rules of the American Rescue Plan ear-
lier this year. 
Given the pandemic, that may well 
have been justified as a temporary 
measure. But now, the administration 
wants to jettison the work requirement 
permanently, and the House Demo-
crats’ bill removes all means testing 
for a new childcare entitlement pro-
gram so even very wealthy families 
would qualify. 
Shouldn’t we look carefully at the 
consequences of sending checks from 
Washington untethered to any work or 
other requirements? Shouldn’t assist-
ance prioritize those with the greatest 
needs but in ways that position them 
to achieve self-reliance? 
There are certainly times when it is 
appropriate for government to step in, 
and no one is arguing that people who 
cannot work, who may have disabil-
ities, for example, should not receive 
government assistance—of course, they 
should. And in a time of crisis, cer-
tainly, we should do all we can to help

those who are in need, through no fault 
of their own, and that is what happened 
during the pandemic. 
There were many temporary pro-
grams that were instituted to help as 
our economy shut down and people 
were laid off. I, along with three of my 
colleagues, authored one of them—the 
Paycheck Protection Program. The ra-
tionale was to allow employers to re-
ceive funding so that they could con-
tinue to pay their employees and keep 
intact that bond between employers 
and employees so that the workers 
could return to the workplace once the 
economy reopened. That program was 
successful and temporary. 
But that is not what this administra-
tion is proposing. Rather, it is creating 
entitlement programs untethered to 
work that would fundamentally change 
incentives for our families, our com-
munities, our society, and our econ-
omy, depriving people of their dignity 
and eroding their ability to provide for 
themselves and their families. Absent a 
pandemic or other crisis, Washington 
should 
not 
simply 
write 
monthly 
checks, creating dependency among 
those who could have a better life. The 
Federal Government’s obligation is not 
fulfilled by simply sending a check, 
washing its hands of any responsibility 
to actually help people achieve self-suf-
ficiency. 
It appears that this administration is 
moving toward the left’s proposal for a 
guaranteed minimum income, regard-
less of one’s ability to work. Never for-
get that the first version of the Green 
New Deal included a guaranteed in-
come for those ‘‘unable or unwilling to 
work.’’ We must not go down that path. 
We will not build a more prosperous, 
just, and equitable society, character-
ized 
by 
opportunity, 
dignity, 
and 
meaning, just by issuing government 
checks. The time-tested way to achieve 
those goals for American families is by 
supporting and rewarding work. It is by 
recognizing the dignity of work. And 
that is the tradition that we must con-
tinue to embrace. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, it is 
one of the most basic questions that we 
get in almost any setting: What do you 
do? It is common conversation, back 
and forth between adults or teenagers 
or college students alike: What do you 
do? 
It is a philosophical issue, though, 
that really has to be addressed, and, in-
terestingly enough, it has become a 
greater divide between Republicans and 
Democrats of late. It didn’t used to be 
that way. 
The simple conversation about ‘‘what 
do you do’’ and encouraging people to 
be able to be engaged in productive 
work and what they do seemed to be 
something that was unified. 
Democrats and Republicans alike ral-
lied in the 1990s, as Bill Clinton de-
clared: We are ending welfare as we 
know it. A 60-year experiment of send-
ing out checks to individuals, saying 
we are going to help people escape pov-
erty by sending a check to individuals, 
and if we give them a check, they will 
rise out of poverty. 
Bill Clinton stood before the Nation 
and said: I campaigned to end that be-
cause that experiment didn’t work, and 
he focused in a whole different direc-
tion, encouraging, as he spoke often on 
deadbeat dads, individuals that should 
pay their child support, need to pay it, 
and he highlighted how many people 
weren’t doing that because those fami-
lies were left exposed. 
And he talked about the dignity of 
work, saying: To help people to be able 
to escape from poverty, we need to 
incentivize work and stop just sending 
a check to individuals but instead at-
tach that to work. 
The Nation stood and cheered and 
rallied around a moment to say: Let’s 
help people, but let’s help people actu-
ally rise. 
There is a statement that I heard 
often, even during that time period: 
Let’s not make welfare a hammock; 
let’s make it a trampoline, that they 
can get assistance for a moment and be 
lifted out and to be able to rise to 
other things. 
I thought that was a settled issue, 
until just last year. I suddenly started 
hearing President Biden on the cam-
paign trail, and now in office, with my 
Democratic colleagues in the House al-
ready passing something over there in 
their committees, saying: We want to 
actually go back to welfare as we knew 
it. We want to be able to go back to 
that failed experiment, when we used 
to just mail checks to people, and so 
people in government would feel good 
to say: We took care of childhood pov-
erty. 
I have already heard people—even 
today in this body—say: If we pass this 
$31⁄2 trillion proposal, we will cut child-
hood poverty in half. That was a state-
ment that was made pre-1990s, when 
government believed if I just mailed a 
check, suddenly children would rise out 
of poverty because the numbers are 
right. But, actually, what we discov-
ered was inflation would rise as checks 
were mailed out, and families were 
trapped in permanent levels of poverty 
because there was a disincentive to ac-
tually engage in work. 
Now, again, this used to not be a Re-
publican-Democrat thing. This was just 
a thing that we could look at the data. 
Brookings Institute, which is a left- 
leaning think tank—I think we could 
all commonly agree with that. The 
Brookings Institute has, year after 
year, gone back to be able to look at 
how people actually escape poverty. 
How does it happen? What are the fea-
tures that are there if people—if it is 
true in their life that they escaped pov-
erty. They have identified three areas; 
that if these three areas are true, you 
will escape poverty. 
No. 1, graduate high school. People 
that graduate high school, much lower 
level. No. 2, have a full-time job; have 
an income; if you actually are working 
full time. And, No. 3, if you wait until 
21 to be married and then have children 
after marriage. 
If those three things are true, the 
Brookings Institute said only 2 percent 
of the people actually are in poverty. 
Seventy-five percent of those folks in 
poverty that graduate high school, get 
a full-time job, have children after 
marriage—if those three things are 
true, 75 percent of them rise into the 
middle class. 
This is not rocket science in some 
ways; it is just human nature. But the 
bill that is being set in front of us that 
is $31⁄2
trillion in entitlements—and 
just to be able to put in perspective 
how large that is, if you combined the 
budgets of all 50 States, the total budg-
et of all 50 States, it is $2 trillion. This 
new entitlement bill is $31⁄2
trillion 
that is being proposed—$31⁄2 trillion of 
new entitlements that would go to in-
dividuals that removes things like an 
incentive to work. It says you can get 
childcare tax credits, even if you are 
not working; that no matter if you are 
working or not—and the current limit, 
by the way, don’t forget, is only $2,500 
of income in a year. If you will do at 
least $2,500 worth of income in a year, 
then you get additional assistance. It 
is the encouragement to say the State 
will come alongside of you, but we have 
got to help you to be able to rise out of 
this spot—even that is taken away. 
There is a marriage penalty that is 
included in this. Ironically, when I read 
from the Brookings Institute, and they 
say, ‘‘Do you want to help people rise 
out of poverty,’’ there is actually a 
marriage penalty in this where it actu-
ally punishes. 
So we seem to be punishing work and 
punishing marriage rather than en-
couraging people to be able to rise. 
Listen, this statement should be 
common for us: What do you do? It is 
not just meaningful for individuals and 
for communities, it is meaningful for 
children because, in school, children 
will be asked: What do your parents 
do? And if it is nothing, it matters to 
a child. A child has the example that is 
set in front of them, and it becomes a 
generational issue. We should encour-
age each generation to be able to rise 
and be a part of our society, not to be 
disconnected but to be engaged with all 
of our society. That develops commu-
nity between individuals. It helps our 
economy to grow. It is what made us 
the most powerful economy in the en-
tire world because we had what we 
called the American work ethic. 
The American work ethic was a very 
simple principle that everyone should 
have the opportunity to be able to do 
whatever job they choose to be able to 
do, to be able to have access to the 
economy. 
And if we find any individual or any 
group that is blocked out of the econ-
omy, government steps in and clears 
the path to make sure there is a level 
path to be able to be engaged so that 
everyone has that option to be able to 
engage in the economy; that everyone 
has the chance to be able to rise.

That does not get better by telling 
people: Oh, sit down. You don’t have to 
work. Oh, sit down right over there. We 
will take care of all your kids all the 
way through. You don’t have to en-
gage. 
It sounds nice unless you are living 
in it. And then it traps people in gener-
ational poverty—urban, rural, across 
the country. It traps people in genera-
tional poverty. That doesn’t help fami-
lies. That doesn’t help children. That 
doesn’t bless families and help them to 
be able to rise out of poverty. It keeps 
them trapped in it. 
We have a philosophical difference. 
How do we help people in poverty? I be-
lieve we help people in poverty by 
clearing out of every opportunity and 
making straight level paths, setting 
that in front of individuals and saying: 
You are an American. Go after the 
American dream. Apply the American 
work ethic: try, graduate high school, 
get a job, get married, stay engaged, 
bless your children. I believe that is 
the best way to be able to help our Na-
tion. 
Apparently, others believe that it is 
better just to be able to say: No. You 
can’t do it. Sit down. I will send you a 
check. 
I don’t think that casts a vision for 
their children, and I don’t think that 
helps our Nation. 
If you want to make it very straight-
forward and simple, the census said 
that we have 21 million children who 
have a parent that lived outside the 
household in 2018. Thirty percent of 
those children were in poverty—three 
times the rate of children in house-
holds where both parents were present. 
I could read the Brookings. I can read 
the census data. But I think we all 
know it in our gut; that we provide 
purpose and meaning to people when 
they can answer the question: What do 
you do, and it matters to our country 
and to them as a family. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The Senator from South 
Carolina. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
South 
Carolina. 
Madam President, I thank my col-
leagues, both Senator COLLINS and Sen-
ator LANKFORD, for their thoughts and 
their comments and their words today 
because what we are talking about 
today is not about simply a $31⁄2 tril-
lion spending bill. 
We are talking about something 
more fundamental to what it means to 
be an American. I am proud to be an 
American. I am proud to live in a coun-
try where upward mobility is a reality; 
that we can, by hard work and a strong 
education, change our fortunes in this 
country and not only change it for our-
selves but change it for the generations 
that follow us. 
As Senator LANKFORD talked about 
the three important ingredients of es-
caping poverty, I will say that, as a kid 
who stumbled in high school, who did 
not do well as a freshman, who did not 
see the opportunities that America had 
available, who did not believe always 
that there was a way that a poor kid in 
South Carolina could ever escape pov-
erty, I am thankful that I met a men-
tor and had a powerful mom who be-
lieved in me in a way that I could not 
believe in myself. 
I am thankful to live in a country 
where the American free enterprise 
system provided a pathway forward, 
and if I could just see it and believe it 
and work towards it, it was possible for 
me to achieve the outcomes that we 
are sitting here trying to defend. 
I am thankful that, as a kid who then 
finished high school, went on to col-
lege, and experienced the American 
dream, that we are here together to de-
fend the American dream for the next 
generation. The challenge, of course, is 
that when we look at the $3.5 trillion 
package, it makes it harder for a kid 
trapped in poverty, as I was, to find a 
path forward. 
I will simply say that while we dis-
cuss this $3.5 trillion package, the con-
tent of this package is more concerning 
than the cost of the package. I am cer-
tain that someone on the other side 
will figure out that taking 10 years of 
funding and making it 5 years of fund-
ing cuts it from $3.5 trillion down to 
$1.75 trillion. I am confident that that 
math is easy to do on either side. But 
I am not confident that we can pre-
serve the American dream in all of its 
glory if the content of this package be-
comes law. 
I think about how unfortunate it 
would be, in a nation that is narrowly 
divided, 50–50, that we would find our-
selves, because the Democrats control 
the White House—there is a 50–50 split 
in the Senate that requires the Vice 
President to break a tie and a five-seat 
majority the Democrats have in the 
House. With those slim majorities, 
they want to do something so fun-
damentally 
transformative 
that 
it 
scares me for the future of the kids 
trapped in poverty all over America. 
I don’t know how we will continue to 
be able to preach the good news of eco-
nomic opportunity and economic free-
dom when you are on the road to so-
cialism. The two are antithetical. They 
don’t go in the same direction. There is 
a fork in the road, and we as a nation 
have to choose one. Unfortunately, the 
Democrats, who have the slimmest of 
majorities, have the votes to fun-
damentally weaken the greatest eco-
nomic engine in world history through 
taxing and spending policies that bring 
us so much closer to socialism. 
The Democrats actually want you to 
believe what they say more than what 
you see with your own eyes. You see, 
the breadcrumbs of this $3.5 trillion 
package can be seen by the level of in-
flation. If you put too much money 
into the economy too quickly and the 
supply remains about the same, it 
leads to inflation. 
What inflation means to kids living 
in single-parent households and to peo-
ple living and working paycheck-to- 
paycheck, what inflation means is, it 
means a tax. It means that even with a 
small, marginal increase in your in-
come, with the rate of inflation being 
over 5.5 percent, your spending power 
goes down. 
So when you pull up to the gas sta-
tion, as I did and as so many Ameri-
cans do every single day to go to work, 
and you look at the price per gallon, it 
is over $3 a gallon, which represents 
over a 40-percent increase in the cost of 
gas. On a fixed income, as our Social 
Security recipients and our golden 
Americans are, on people working pay-
check to paycheck, a 40-plus percent 
increase in the cost of gas deprives 
them of some of the luxuries, the mar-
gins in their paychecks, and then stack 
on top of that a 20-percent increase in 
the cost of your utilities. 
It is impossible—impossible—to rec-
ognize the devastating impact that the 
Biden inflation is having already on 
middle-income 
Americans, 
on 
pay-
check-to-paycheck Americans, people 
living in poverty, and single-parent 
households. 
But worse than the inflationary ef-
fect, which, of course, is a precursor to 
the $3.5 trillion, is what the content 
does. Think about this: In America 
today, if you write a check for $10,000, 
the IRS wants to know who you are 
writing it to. Under this proposal, 
imagine, if you will, the IRS spying on 
your bank account for every trans-
action over $600. Imagine four tires— 
more than $600. So the IRS wants to 
know why you are spending $600 on 
tires. Imagine if your engine runs hot 
and you have to take your car in to get 
it checked—more than $600. Imagine 
trying to find the money, scraping the 
resources together just to be able to 
buy school clothes for your kids, and if 
you have a couple kids, a couple pairs 
of shoes, pants—dresses are up 18 per-
cent. Imagine that $600 expense being 
taken out of your account, and the IRS 
is looking into your account to see 
what you are spending the money on. 
The content of this legislation is 
more dangerous than the amount of 
the legislation. And I got to tell you, 
$3.5 trillion is pretty dangerous, but 
more dangerous than the $3.5 trillion is 
having the IRS empowered to take a 
look at every single transaction. Not 
only the $600, but imagine doubling the 
number of IRS agents with the $80 bil-
lion in this package—doubling the 
number of agents to come take a look 
at your family business, your family 
accounts. Destructive. 
Go beyond that. Think about the av-
erage farmer in South Carolina who 
spent their entire life farming and who 
has more land than money. Because of 
this package and its impact on family 
businesses and family farmers, because 
of the way they want to refigure the 
death tax or the estate tax, as we say 
it when we are being polite in mixed 
company, here is what it means: It 
means that you jeopardize the ability 
to pass your family farm to the next 
generation. 
This is not theoretical. You can talk 
to a farmer named Whit Player from

Lee County or Monty Rast in St. Mat-
thews, SC, who have been farming for 
decades. Ask them about the impact of 
not being able to pass the family farm 
or small business to the next genera-
tion. 
Think about punishing the farmers 
and still providing a check for $12,500 
for someone making $800,000 a year to 
buy a luxury vehicle, an electric vehi-
cle. You are going to give them a tax 
credit even though they make $800,000. 
Imagine a part of the bill where 
union workers at an auto factory are 
able to sell their cars with a $4,500 tax 
credit, but the Volvo workers in South 
Carolina, the BMW workers in South 
Carolina who don’t work at a union 
factory—their cars don’t get the $4,500 
tax credit, embedding a unique form of 
bias into this bill. It just doesn’t feel 
right. Restoring the tax credits for the 
State and local taxes for millionaires 
and billionaires across this country 
and putting that burden back on the 
backs of working people, middle-class 
working people. 
I won’t even go into raising the cor-
porate tax from 21 percent to 28 per-
cent or 26.5 percent. I won’t go into 
eliminating passthroughs for small 
businesses, mom-and-pop businesses; a 
20-percent increase because they elimi-
nate the 20-percent credit on their 
small businesses. I won’t get into that 
because we don’t have enough time. I 
won’t get into the raising taxes on in-
dividuals. I won’t get into the capital 
gains tax going from 23.8 to 43.8. I 
won’t get into all of that right now, 
but I will say this: If the Democrats’ 
plan succeeds, I fear for that American 
dream that I am able to live right now. 
I fear that kids stuck in poverty today 
will be stuck in a caste system of so-
cialism tomorrow. 
Madam President, thank you for 
your time, your patience. I am just 
concerned about the greatest Nation 
ever designed in the history of the 
world. Thank you.

NORD STREAM 2 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, over the 
last several weeks, I have talked at 
length about the damage that Presi-
dent Biden and his administration are 
doing to the national security of the 
United States and to the security of 
our allies in Europe by giving Vladimir 
Putin a multibillion-dollar gift in the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. 
Today, I am going to talk about the 
staggering diplomatic damage that the 
President is doing by allowing and, in-
deed, facilitating this project pro-
ceeding. It is well known that Nord 
Stream 2 is opposed across Europe as 
an enabler of and, indeed, an example 
of and a weapon of Russian expan-
sionism and aggression. 
Europeans have good reasons for 
their opposition. They know firsthand 
what the costs are. They know that 
completing Nord Stream 2 will leave 
the entire continent vulnerable to 
Putin’s blackmail and aggression, and 
that NATO’s ability to act will be se-
verely constrained while billions will 
flow into the Kremlin’s coffers. 
What is sometimes underappreciated, 
however, even by the people who are fa-
miliar with this issue, is the all-but- 
complete unanimity of the opposition 
in Europe. 
In 2018, the European Parliament 
voted by a vote of 403 to 105 to oppose 
the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. The pipe-
line proceeded, nonetheless, until it 
was halted by the bipartisan sanctions 
passed by this Congress in December of 
2019—sanctions that I authored along 
with Democrat JEANNE SHAHEEN. The 
pipeline was halted the very day those 
sanctions were signed into law. 
Then, in January of 2021, after Vladi-
mir Putin tried to murder Alexei 
Navalny, 
the 
European 
Parliament 
voted again to oppose Nord Stream 2, 
this time by a vote of 581 to 50. 
So I want you to pause for a second 
and reflect on the fact that Joe Biden 
looked at that vote and said the Presi-
dent of the United States is with the 
50—never mind the 581—in the Euro-
pean Parliament. The Biden adminis-
tration was going to side with Russia 
on a 90-percent issue, where the Biden 
White House is on the losing side. 
Throughout all this process, there 
were plenty of voices in Germany who 
were opposed, especially after this vi-
cious attempt on Navalny’s life. The 
Parliamentary leader of the Greens, 
Katrin Goering-Eckardt, said: 
The blatant assassination attempt by the 
mafia-like structures of the Kremlin can no 
longer leave us merely concerned, it must 
have real consequences. 
Stating, ‘‘We need a clear answer’’ 
that will ‘‘make clear, Nord Stream 2 
is no longer something we can com-
plete with Russia.’’ 
Mr. President, my request to Senate 
Democrats, my request to President 
Biden, my request to KAMALA HARRIS is 
listen to the Greens. That is not a sen-
tence I have uttered on the floor of the 
Senate before, nor is it one I anticipate 
saying frequently in the future. But 
the Greens in Germany are telling you 
this is a bad idea; yet today’s Demo-
cratic 
Party 
that 
exalts 
climate 
change as the greatest issue in the cos-
mos, when it comes to kissing up and 
surrendering to Putin, decided to tell 
the Greens to go jump in the lake. 
Former 
NATO 
Secretary 
General 
Anders Fogh Rasmussen issued a state-
ment that: 
Germany is asking for European and NATO 
solidarity in response to the despicable 
Navalny poisoning. They will get it, but an 
honest answer from Putin is unlikely. Time 
has come for Germany to halt Nord Stream 
2 construction, before it’s too late. 
If Senate Democrats mean what they 
have said for years on Nord Stream 2, 
then listen to the former Secretary 
General of NATO; listen to the Greens 
in Germany. 
But now, bizarrely, after Joe Biden 
has ignored the Greens, after Joe Biden 
has ignored NATO, after Joe Biden has 
ignored our Central European allies, all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6724 
September 28, 2021 
of this was done in the hopes of getting 
goodwill and support from Angela 
Merkel. 
The Biden White House—the political 
geniuses that presided over the sur-
render and failure in Afghanistan, the 
greatest foreign policy catastrophe in a 
generation—their plan was, let’s piss 
the whole rest of the world off so that 
we can make friends with Angela 
Merkel. By making friends with Angela 
Merkel, let’s let Putin complete his 
pipeline. 
Perversely, 
President 
Biden 
and 
Merkel issued their statement as a dec-
laration for support of our Eastern Eu-
ropean allies. 
Boy, with support like that, who 
needs enemies? 
I would like to read a joint statement 
from our Polish and Ukrainian allies in 
response to the laughable statement 
that Biden and Merkel put out. Here is 
what our Polish and Ukrainian allies 
said: 
The decision to build Nord Stream 2 made 
in 2015 mere months after Russia’s invasion 
and illegal annexation of Ukrainian terri-
tory, created security, credibility, and polit-
ical crisis in Europe. 
This crisis is significantly deepened 
by the resignation from attempts to 
stop the launch of the Nord Stream 2 
gas pipeline. 
By the way, as an aside, that resigna-
tion would be Joe Biden’s abandoning 
of U.S. law sanctioning Russia. 
The letter continued: 
This decision has created political, mili-
tary, and energy threat for Ukraine and Cen-
tral Europe, while increasing Russia’s poten-
tial to destabilize the security situation in 
Europe, perpetuating divisions among NATO 
and European Union member states. 
Let me read that again: 
This decision— 
Joe Biden’s political genius, surren-
dering to Russia— 
has created political, military, and energy 
threat for Ukraine and Central Europe— 
That sounds bad. It is bad— 
while increasing Russia’s potential to desta-
bilize the security situation in Europe, per-
petuating divisions among NATO and Euro-
pean Union member states. 
The letter continued: 
Ukraine and Poland will work together 
with their allies and partners to oppose Nord 
Stream 2 until solutions are developed to ad-
dress the security crisis created by Nord 
Stream 2, to provide support to countries as-
piring to membership in Western democratic 
institutions, and to reduce threats to peace 
and energy security. 
Mr. President, what do our friends in 
Ukraine and Poland tell us? 
That Joe Biden’s decision has created 
a ‘‘threat to peace and energy secu-
rity.’’ 
But even then, Biden-Harris officials 
insisted that they had worked out se-
curity arrangements; it was all per-
fectly taken care of. They would ensure 
that Russia would never, ever, ever use 
Nord Stream 2 for blackmail. 
Mr. President, that is their promise. 
That is Joe Biden’s promise. Fear not, 
they have it figured out and they have 
commitments that Russia will never 
use Nord Stream 2 for energy black-
mail. 
How long do you think those com-
mitments lasted? 
If you have a stopwatch, I am not 
sure the stopwatch could measure in-
crements of time that small because 
Russia didn’t even give a decent inter-
val, didn’t let the ink dry on the Biden 
White House press release before they 
immediately began doing the thing 
that Biden promised Russia would 
never do. Biden White House said: We 
have an agreement to make sure Rus-
sia never uses it for energy blackmail. 
What did Putin say? Excuse me, we 
are in the middle of energy blackmail. 
So we don’t even have to wait a year, 
2 years, 5 years. We don’t have to wait 
a month. We don’t have to wait a week. 
We don’t have to wait a day to know if 
the Biden promise was true or false 
that Russia would never engage in en-
ergy blackmail over Nord Stream 2. 
Why? Because they are doing it right 
now, this instant, as we stand here. 
Just one week ago, the Kremlin and 
its gas barons, the oligarchs—the cor-
rupt mafia oligarchs that run Russia— 
said that if Europe wants reliable gas 
as we approach winter—and, gosh, did 
we mention it gets cold in Europe, that 
having gas to heat your homes and pre-
vent your grandmother from freezing 
to death might be a nice thing? 
Well, 
the 
Kremlin 
and 
the 
gas 
oligarchs said it is very simple: If they 
want to have heat, all they need to do 
is rush through the activation of Nord 
Stream 2. 
They said: ‘‘Undoubtedly, the earliest 
possible commission of Nord Stream 2 
will help balance the natural gas crisis 
in Europe.’’ 
Undoubtedly. 
Russia is literally reducing the sup-
ply right now, today, exercising its 
blackmail in September. 
The Presiding Officer lives in the 
Northeast United States. September is 
a beautiful time of year. The autumn 
leaves are turning. The breeze is crisp. 
You are not right yet shivering to turn 
on the heat at night. The same is true 
in Europe. But fast forward to Novem-
ber, fast forward to December, to Janu-
ary, to February, when the bitter cold 
starts setting in, when having gas or 
not, and having heat or not, is the dif-
ference between living and dying. 
What are the Russian oligarchs say-
ing? 
They say, very simply: ‘‘Undoubt-
edly, the earliest possible commis-
sioning of Nord Stream 2 will help bal-
ance the natural gas crisis in Europe.’’ 
And, of course, the response from 
Biden and from Germany has been 
crickets. Remember, Biden and Merkel 
said, if they try that—those dastardly 
Russians—we will stand up boldly to 
them, we will hold them to account. 
Where is Joe Biden? No, I mean that 
seriously. Where is Joe Biden? 
Nowhere. Maybe in the White House 
basement. I don’t know. But he is not 
doing anything to stand up to the Rus-
sian energy blackmail happening right 
now. By the way, neither is Merkel. 
Their promises just weeks ago have al-
ready been demonstrated to be com-
pletely hollow and empty. The protec-
tions of their bogus deal were, on their 
face, a bluff; were, on their face, 
empty. 
But how often is it in politics that 
such an empty promise gets revealed as 
a lie minutes after it is made? 
In this case, Putin was only too 
happy to oblige. That is why we call 
the pipeline the Biden-Putin pipeline. 
But, of course, the punch line of all 
of this—so the Biden administration 
has managed to tick off Europe, to tick 
off the European Union. They managed 
to tick off Ukraine. They managed to 
tick off Poland. They managed to tick 
off the Eastern Europeans. They have 
also independently managed to tick off 
the French so much that they pulled 
their 
Ambassador 
home 
from 
the 
United States. 
But they did all of this, they said, in 
the deep gravelly tones of the Foggy 
Bottom establishment. They did all of 
this to build lasting relationships with 
Angela Merkel. And that would pay 
dividends. Never mind a generation of 
billions for Putin and Russia; never 
mind a generation of energy captivity 
for Europe; never mind thousands of 
high-paying jobs in America—union 
jobs, good union jobs—destroyed by 
Biden; never mind that. The benefit of 
making Angela Merkel is worth it. 
Mr. President, you know, there is an 
old saying that God has a sense of 
humor. That was illustrated this week-
end because, this weekend, there was 
an election in Germany. The people 
went to vote. 
And what happened? 
The German voters went to vote, and 
Merkel’s party didn’t win the election. 
Now the Social Democrats will be look-
ing to form a coalition with the 
Greens. 
Which Greens? 
Oh, the very same Greens that are 
passionately opposed to Nord Stream 2, 
that cried vociferously to kill the pipe-
line, and Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS said: Go jump in a lake. 
The new coalition. 
By the way, just about every elec-
toral scenario that comes out of this 
election will empower the Greens in 
Germany, and the political geniuses in 
the White House have just alienated 
and antagonized the Greens. 
Biden’s supine giveaway. Isn’t that a 
good word—supine? It describes the 
Biden foreign policy for every enemy of 
America: Be flat on your belly, and 
give our enemies what they want. 
Biden’s supine giveaway to Putin was 
all for nothing. It literally produced 
nothing for the United States. It alien-
ated our friends, and it emboldened our 
enemies. 
If you are Xi in China and you see 
Joe Biden rolling over and surren-
dering to Vladimir Putin, giving him 
everything he wants—giving him a 
pipeline that will enrich him for gen-
erations to come—what do you think

September 28, 2021 
Xi is thinking? I can tell you what Xi 
is thinking. Xi is thinking this is a 
President who is weak who will sur-
render to me too. We saw that dem-
onstrated just in recent days, where 
the Biden administration surrendered 
on a senior executive from Huawei in 
allowing her to go back to China, giv-
ing Communist China exactly what it 
wanted. And, once again, what does Xi 
take and what do the Chinese Com-
munist leaders take from that? That 
this President will roll over, will sur-
render. 
And, you know, there is a striking 
irony. These catastrophic decisions and 
failures are particularly jaw-dropping 
given that President Biden ran on a 
platform of restoring diplomacy. Do 
you remember the refrain ‘‘the adults 
are back’’? It was said with this moral 
superiority—that the Biden guys were 
going to come in, and no more of this 
American strength. Huh-uh. The adults 
know better. 
Here is what Joe Biden said on Feb-
ruary 4: 
I want the world to hear today: America is 
back. America is back. Diplomacy is back at 
the center of our foreign policy. . . . We will 
repair our alliances and engage with the 
world once again, not to meet yesterday’s 
challenges but today’s and tomorrow’s. 
Biden spoke specifically about Rus-
sia. He said: 
American leadership must meet this new 
moment of advancing authoritarianism, in-
cluding . . . the determination of Russia to 
damage and disrupt our democracy. 
Biden added that ‘‘we must start 
with diplomacy rooted in America’s 
most cherished democratic values: de-
fending freedom [and] championing op-
portunity.’’ 
You know, if irony had ever been 
alive, that speech killed irony. If irony 
were dead and buried, that speech made 
irony roll over in her grave. Literally 
every word of that speech, every syl-
lable of every word down to ‘‘and’’ and 
‘‘the,’’ has been proven false. 
‘‘America is back,’’ Biden told us. 
‘‘Diplomacy is back.’’ ‘‘We will repair 
our alliances.’’ Mr. President, how has 
that gone? Have we, in fact, repaired 
our alliances? With Nord Stream 2, 
Biden has pissed off the French, the 
Polish, the Ukrainians, the European 
Union. Has Biden repaired our alli-
ances? 
Has Biden engaged with the world 
once again? Well, if ‘‘engaged with the 
world’’ means to surrender to Putin 
and give him everything he wants, then 
I guess so. 
To meet not yesterday’s challenges 
but today’s and tomorrow’s—how is 
giving Putin a massive natural gas 
pipeline 
meeting 
tomorrow’s 
chal-
lenges unless the challenges are how to 
fund Russia’s military? If those are the 
challenges he is talking about, then 
congratulations, Joe Biden; you actu-
ally lived up to that. 
He spoke about Russia. ‘‘American 
leadership must meet this new moment 
of advancing authoritarianism.’’ How 
did Joe Biden and KAMALA
HARRIS 
meet this new moment of advancing 
authoritarianism? By funding it. Every 
year, Putin will cash a check of a cou-
ple billion dollars, courtesy of Joseph 
Biden. What should we use this couple 
of billion dollars for? How about for ad-
vancing authoritarianism. 
Biden said: 
We must start with diplomacy rooted in 
America’s most cherished democratic values: 
defending freedom. 
Mr. President, let me ask you some-
thing. Whose freedom did Joe Biden de-
fend with this pipeline? He certainly 
didn’t 
defend 
the 
freedom 
of 
the 
Ukrainians. He didn’t defend the free-
dom of the Poles. He didn’t defend the 
freedom of Europe. He didn’t defend the 
freedom of France. He didn’t defend 
even the freedom of Germany. Merkel 
wants this, but the voters in Germany 
have made clear that they don’t want 
it. He didn’t defend the freedom of the 
men and women of Georgia, of the Bal-
tics—of all the former Soviet Republics 
whose safety and security is now jeop-
ardized because Biden has decided to be 
a principal funder of the Russian mili-
tary. That is not defending freedom. 
He certainly didn’t defend America’s 
freedom. On his first day in office, Joe 
Biden shut down the Keystone Pipe-
line. He killed 11,000 jobs, including 
8,000 union jobs. John Kerry helpfully 
told those union members: Learn to 
code. You silly, dirty worker who 
wants to work on a pipeline, no, no, no. 
Sit down at a MacBook instead. 
How is it that the same President 
who kills American jobs on an Amer-
ican pipeline creates Russian jobs on a 
Russian pipeline? I don’t know what 
you call that, but you don’t call it de-
fending freedom. You don’t call it 
championing opportunity. 
You know, I have to say, some years 
ago, I traveled to Europe. I was in 
Ukraine. I was in Poland. I was in Esto-
nia. When I was there, I met with the 
leaders there, and I asked them about 
Russian aggression. This was years 
ago. I asked them about standing up to 
Russian aggression. To a person, when 
I asked them that, the blood drained 
out of their face, because, for the 
Poles, for the Ukrainians, for the Esto-
nians, Russian tanks in the streets is 
not a hypothetical. That is not a sce-
nario they are wondering what that 
would be like. Those of us old enough 
to remember it, as they sat at the table 
with me, they remembered. They re-
membered those Russian tanks. 
Vladimir Putin has said, in perhaps 
the most candid moment of his life, 
that he considers the greatest geo-
political disaster of the 20th century to 
be the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
The natural corollary of that is that 
his foreign policy objective is to recre-
ate the Soviet Union and to subjugate 
the former Soviet Republics. 
One of the most dangerous con-
sequences of this pipeline, of the Biden- 
Putin pipeline, is that if this pipeline is 
allowed to go online, I fear we will see 
Russian tanks again on the ground in 
Ukraine. 
Mr. President, you and I both serve 
on the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. If and when that happens—in 6 
months, in a year, in 2 years—I am 
going to ask you to remember these re-
marks, if and when we see Russian 
tanks on the streets in Ukraine, be-
cause Putin is no longer afraid that 
Ukraine is needed to transit energy. 
Putin now has his own pipeline—the 
Biden-Putin pipeline—to circumvent 
Ukraine. 
If we see that subjugation of our ally, 
if we see that subjugation of liberty, 
Mr. President, I hope you and I hope 
every Member of this body and I hope 
the American people remember right 
now that Joe Biden, in February, said: 
‘‘We must start with diplomacy rooted 
in America’s most cherished demo-
cratic values: defending freedom [and] 
championing opportunity.’’ He has an 
opportunity to do so. 
By the way, let me point out some-
thing. The Biden administration has a 
fantastic opportunity for a reset. Let’s 
assume somebody in the administra-
tion realizes they screwed up on this 
pipeline. When they are losing votes in 
the European Parliament by a vote of 
500 to 50, that ought to be a signal, par-
ticularly for people who pride them-
selves on their foreign policy prowess, 
on the adults being back. Losing a 10- 
to-1 vote in the European Parliament 
is not indicative of diplomacy being 
back. 
By the way, when they lose the vote 
in this body—in both the House and 
Senate—when we have addressed Nord 
Stream 2, every time we have done it, 
it has been virtually unanimous. The 
margins of the U.S. Congress have been 
bigger than 500 to 50. 
So let’s say somebody in the Biden 
White 
House 
is 
having 
second 
thoughts. I don’t know if they are. 
Maybe they are so committed to their 
policy that facts be damned; no second 
thoughts on that. But let’s say some-
one is. Then Joe Biden has been given 
a gift. He has been given a gift of the 
recent German election. 
There has been only one argument 
that the Biden White House has put 
forward for surrendering to Putin on 
this pipeline, and that is to make the 
German Government happy. It is a bad 
argument. It is an argument the Pre-
siding Officer has rejected, that I have 
rejected. Virtually every Senator in 
this body, Democrat and Republican, 
has rejected it as a bad argument that 
hurts America, that hurts Europe, that 
helps Putin. 
But, for sake of argument, let’s give 
the Biden White House the benefit of 
the doubt. Let’s assume they really be-
lieve that. Well, this weekend gave him 
a gift. If the lone benefit they achieved 
was this will make the German Gov-
ernment happy, what do we know now? 
This makes the German Government 
unhappy. 
As we stand here today, the ledger of 
cost and benefits is very simple: There 
is one winner on the Biden-Putin pipe-
line, and that is Vladimir Putin; that

is Russia; that is the Russian Army. 
Everybody else is a loser. So I would 
say to the Biden White House they 
have an easy gift: Reverse course. 
By the way, the Biden State Depart-
ment, Secretary Blinken, fought to im-
pose these sanctions, and political 
operatives in the Biden White House 
overruled the Secretary of State. 
Secretary Blinken, you have a fabu-
lous opportunity. 
The Secretary of State is unhappy 
that I have holds on nominees to the 
Department of State. The Presiding Of-
ficer is unhappy as he sends repeated 
tweets, expressing his dismay that I 
am using the leverage of a Senator to 
try to stop this pipeline. 
Well, I have good news: The German 
electorate has given you an answer to 
this problem. 
The Biden White House has an easy 
excuse. The German Government is 
changing. So their only benefit—to 
make the German Government happy— 
has disappeared. If all they care about 
is making the German Government 
happy—if they don’t care about the 
rest of Europe; if they don’t care about 
Ukraine; if they don’t care about the 
European Union; if they don’t care 
about American jobs; if they don’t care 
about Putin getting richer and strong-
er—if the only criterion is to make the 
German Government happy, do you 
know what they should do today? Sanc-
tion Nord Stream 2 AG. Follow the 
law. If they do that, I will lift the 
holds, and these nominations can pro-
ceed very, very quickly. 
The German voters have given Joe 
Biden a gift. The only question is if 
anyone in the White House is paying 
attention, if anyone wants to accept 
the gift, or are they too stubborn? 
They 
have 
picked 
their 
course, 
dammit, and they are going to go down 
with the ship even if it hurts America 
forever. 
There is still time to stop this pipe-
line. The question is, Does anyone in 
the White House care? I hope and pray 
that they do because if Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS persist in their deci-
sion to completely and totally sur-
render to Vladimir Putin, that will 
harm the United States not for a year, 
not for 10 years, but for 30, 40, 50 years 
going forward. 
Mr. President, the German voters 
have given you a gift. You should take 
it. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 2850 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise today 
to express my deep concern with Presi-
dent Biden’s disregard for American 
freedom. President Biden’s strong-arm 
push to force Americans to choose be-
tween their health and decisions affect-
ing their health, on the one hand, and 
providing for their families, on the 
other hand, is wrong. 
I simply do not believe the Federal 
Government has any business man-
dating the COVID–19 vaccination for 
all Americans. 
Now, let me be clear. I believe that 
vaccines, broadly speaking, have pro-
vided immense benefits to society, 
nearly 
eradicating 
measles, 
polio, 
smallpox, and more in the United 
States. 
I 
have 
personally 
received 
the 
COVID–19 vaccination, as has my en-
tire family, and I view the rapid devel-
opment of effective COVID–19 vaccines 
as a miracle; one that safeguards the 
vulnerable from severe illness and from 
hospitalization. 
I believe that the FDA’s expedited 
approval process is effective at effi-
ciently reviewing and producing gen-
erally safe drugs and devices for Ameri-
cans’ use. 
Additionally, I believe the emergency 
use authorization can make drugs 
available to Americans more quickly, 
which, in some cases, can mean the dif-
ference between life and death. 
So even with the speed by which 
COVID–19 vaccines were developed and 
made available, I very much believe 
that they are generally safe. However, 
receiving the vaccine is a decision that 
Americans should make with all the 
facts in front of them, in consultation 
with their doctors, and with full con-
sideration of their own current health 
circumstances. 
However, President Biden made his 
intentions clear when announcing his 
Federal mandate saying: ‘‘This is not 
about freedom or personal choice.’’ 
Look, we have got to remember that 
anytime someone, someone who is 
serving as the President of the United 
States, while issuing a sweeping Fed-
eral mandate, insists that this is not 
about freedom or personal choice, it is. 
It necessarily is. It unavoidably is. 
The fact that he made this statement 
is troubling. The statement highlights 
the fact that the President does not 
understand the key relationship be-
tween citizens and government under 
our Constitution. 
Every mandate, regulation, tax, or 
any 
other 
government 
imposition 
comes necessarily at the cost of free-
dom and personal choice of Americans. 
It is a tradeoff we make with govern-
ment. Use of overwhelming govern-
ment power, without even considering 
the implications on freedom, is pre-
cisely why our Founders thought the 
Declaration of Independence, a revolu-
tion, and our Constitution were nec-
essary. 
I have heard from many Utahans who 
are at risk of being unemployed if they 
choose not to get the vaccine. In fact, 
within the last week alone, my office 
has heard from no fewer than 144 
Utahns in distress for this very reason. 
Allow me to share just a few of their 
stories: 
A young woman in Utah has two 
autoimmune diseases. She was told by 
her doctor that she should not get vac-
cinated because of her existing health 
conditions. Yet her employer has in-
formed her that, contrary to her doc-
tor’s recommendations, she must get 
the vaccine or be fired. Get the vaccine 
or be fired, those are the only two op-
tions she is left with. 
A soon-to-be-mother, who has been 
advised not to get the vaccine because 
of her pregnancy, has been told by her 
employer that she must choose be-
tween receiving the vaccine and receiv-
ing a paycheck. Without her job, she 
will not have the means to care for her 
child. 
A disabled veteran, who now spends 
his time working for the VA because he 
loves helping his fellow veterans, has 
been informed that he must be fully 
vaccinated within the next 75 days or 
lose his employment. This ultimatum 
imposed by President Biden is making 
him choose between receiving an un-
wanted medical procedure, on the one 
hand, while, on the other hand, being 
unable to provide for his pregnant wife 
and their child. 
After businesses have weathered the 
economic impacts of COVID–19 and the 
corresponding shutdowns that have led 
to so many closures and bankruptcies, 
President Biden now wants to force 
employers to act as a sort of medical 
police force. They must impose a vac-
cine mandate on their workforce or be 
forced to pay a heavy fine. 
This mandate is constitutionally du-
bious—and that is putting it mildly— 
and it is not reasonable and it neglects 
the interests of business owners, fami-
lies, and individuals alike. 
Look, threatening the employment of 
millions of Americans and making em-
ployers become enforcers is not how 
our country will return to normal. It is 
not even how you will make more peo-
ple decide to get the vaccine. These 
steps will only erode meaningful rela-
tionships that Americans have with 
one another. 
The utility of such a sweeping man-
date is also in question. In fact, a re-
cent study from three hospitals in 
Israel shows that natural immunity 
was ‘‘27 times more effective than vac-
cinated immunity in preventing symp-
tomatic infections.’’ 
This mandate completely ignores ex-
isting 
evidence-based 
data 
lending 
credibility to the reality that millions 
of Americans may not need to be vac-
cinated because they have acquired 
natural 
immunity 
from 
previous 
COVID–19 illness. Further, the man-
date dismisses the reality that there 
are outstanding questions regarding 
the COVID–19 vaccine’s safe adminis-
tration 
to 
those 
who 
are 
immunocompromised or have certain 
other health-related concerns or how 
to accommodate any who may have ob-
jections rooted in religious or other 
sincerely held beliefs. 
The decision to engage in a medical 
procedure, you see, is personal. It is

deeply personal, and even the idea that 
it can be forced upon citizens by the 
Federal Government is offensive. If 
particular American citizens do not 
feel that the receipt of the COVID–19 
vaccine is the right decision for them 
or their children, then they are enti-
tled to that belief. 
A mandate by the Biden administra-
tion to be vaccinated against COVID–19 
under threat of unemployment will not 
quell Americans’ concerns; instead, it 
will likely further erode the little trust 
that may currently exist. 
Now, I don’t believe that the Federal 
Government has been as transparent as 
it must. In its effort to get as many 
people vaccinated as possible, it has 
neglected the responsibility to inform 
Americans of any adverse effects that 
some may have experienced. These un-
fortunate instances of harm following 
the administration of COVID–19 vac-
cines must be acknowledged even if 
they are rare. 
The fact that instances of adverse re-
actions to the COVID–19 vaccines are 
not being shared with the public or 
even, in many cases, the medical com-
munity, causes me grave, grave con-
cern. It has left those who have been 
adversely harmed with almost nowhere 
to turn. It has caused distrust in the 
unvaccinated that the government may 
have something to hide. 
When openly and transparently in-
formed, I believe that each and every 
American is able to handle the respon-
sibility of weighing the risks of getting 
vaccinated or not getting vaccinated. I 
honestly believe that most Americans, 
after speaking to their doctors, will 
make the decision that is best for 
themselves, for their families, and for 
our country. 
Finally, while I have not seen the 
final regulation for President Biden’s 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate, nor do I 
know definitively even what statute he 
is claiming provides him with this 
sweeping authority, I highly doubt 
that this unilateral action is constitu-
tional. But, frankly, I don’t think the 
President cares. President Biden knows 
the effects his announcement and even 
a temporary regulation will have, even 
if it is later ruled unconstitutional. 
Even if the mandate is never fully or 
ever implemented, it still could get 
him what he wants. 
Businesses across the Nation are 
yielding before the awesome might of 
the Federal Government in complying 
with this Executive mandate before it 
has even legally been drafted, let alone 
enforced. 
According to the vague outline that 
President Biden’s speech provided, a 
business would risk going under if even 
a small percentage of its workforce 
were unvaccinated at the time enforce-
ment begins. This is a scare tactic—a 
scare tactic of the absolute worst 
sort—and it is working. People are 
scared, and I am here to defend them. 
Today, in this bill, the Senate has 
the opportunity to protect those in the 
minority, those Americans who sin-
cerely believe, due to religious convic-
tion or otherwise, that they should not 
receive the COVID–19 vaccine. 
This bill would not prevent busi-
nesses from imposing their own man-
dates or establishing rules for their 
own workplaces. All this bill would do 
is to ensure that the Federal vaccine 
mandate provides an exemption for 
Americans whose sincere beliefs pre-
vent them from receiving the vaccine. 
Furthermore, nothing in Federal law 
provides President Biden the authority 
to institute the vaccine mandate on 
private-sector employers or on the pub-
lic at large, and today Congress has the 
opportunity to rectify this situation 
for the American people. 
Now, I want to be clear. This is not 
the end of my discussion here. I have 12 
of these bills. I will be back tomorrow 
and the next day, for as long as it 
takes to win the fight against this 
sweeping mandate. 
So, Mr. President, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 2850 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; I ask unanimous 
consent that the bill be considered read 
a third time and passed and that the 
motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). Is there objection? 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, this unnec-
essary bill will undermine our efforts 
to end a pandemic that has killed over 
685,000 people and counting. 
We are fighting a highly contagious 
virus. If people don’t get vaccinated, 
variants like Delta will continue to 
spread, undermine our economy, and 
take lives. Getting people vaccinated is 
one of the most important things we 
can do to stop COVID–19. 
And let’s be clear. Immunization re-
quirements are nothing new in this 
country. State and local governments 
and school districts have required vac-
cination against diseases like polio and 
measles for over a century. Taking 
similar steps against COVID is just 
commonsense. 
Tailored exemptions for legitimate 
religious and medical considerations 
already exist in current law and are in-
cluded in President Biden’s policy. 
This bill could undermine existing 
protections and create a massive loop-
hole that would lead to more unneces-
sary and preventable deaths. 
It is so frustrating to know how 
scared people are of this virus, to know 
how many people it has killed, to know 
how hard people are trying to do the 
right thing and how eager they are for 
this to end, only to have Republicans 
offer ideas that would create political 
division, prolong this crisis, and cost 
more lives, so I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I want to be 
very clear about something. There are 
no exemptions built into the mandate 
because the mandate doesn’t yet exist. 
As far as I can tell, this may be a fea-
ture and not a bug, you see, because he 
gave a speech—he gave a speech—talk-
ing about the fact that he was going to 
issue the mandate. He didn’t release 
any 
legally 
operative 
documents, 
didn’t even disclose his precise source 
of authority to do this—authority 
which I highly doubt even exists. So 
there is no document to challenge. No 
one can sue to challenge the document 
because the document doesn’t exist. 
But businesses everywhere fear and, 
indeed, know that it is coming, and so 
their general counsel’s offices, their 
human resources departments for em-
ployers with more than 99 employees in 
this country are scrambling to get 
ahead of it. Many are even adopting 
and some, I am told, are moving for-
ward with enforcing or preparing to en-
force those same policies. So what will 
happen is that those employees who 
have these sincerely held objections 
will be without recourse. 
Now, my friend and colleague from 
Washington makes the point that these 
exemptions are already there. That is a 
legal and factual impossibility because 
the mandate does not yet exist. The 
document isn’t in there, which begs the 
question: If it already exists, then what 
would be her objection or anyone’s ob-
jection to merely adopting a measure 
that says any such mandate, if and 
when it is issued, must contain such an 
exemption—an 
objection 
that 
my 
friend and colleague from Washington 
assures us already exists. It is difficult 
for me to understand how this would be 
objectionable. 
Without these protections, you see, 
President Biden is telling many reli-
gious minorities in the country that 
they need not apply for a job, and if 
they have got a job already, that that 
job is in jeopardy. 
Freedom to make one’s own medical 
decisions is fundamental to our system 
of liberty. The economic impact of the 
mandate is going to hamper our eco-
nomic recovery as workers are forced 
to make hard decisions. 
Here we are talking specifically 
about objections rooted in religious or 
other sincerely held personal beliefs. If, 
in fact, that exemption already exists, 
that protection is already there, which 
it isn’t because it can’t be because the 
document itself doesn’t exist, then why 
not embrace it? Why not accept it? 
Why not acknowledge it in law? 
I struggle to imagine what harm 
could come from protecting religious 
minorities in this country, and I find it 
very discouraging and very distressing 
that 
this 
body, 
the 
U.S. 
Senate, 
wouldn’t want to do everything we pos-
sibly could to make that happen. 
Another word about the fact that it 
doesn’t yet exist; the mandate isn’t 
there. Because it is not there, employ-
ers with more than 99 employees 
around the country are being forced to

guess as to what it might mean, and a 
whole lot of them are already pre-
paring their own policies—in some 
cases, already adopting them and en-
forcing them based on their own antici-
pation of what the mandate may be. 
What it means as a practical matter is, 
you can’t sue anyone. You can’t sue 
any administrator in the Biden admin-
istration or elsewhere in the Federal 
Government who is going to be enforc-
ing this because you don’t know what 
they are going to be enforcing. There 
isn’t a dispute ripe for adjudication in 
any court anywhere because we don’t 
know what that is. 
For many people, this entire exercise 
could be rendered moot in the mean-
time, not just moot in the sense that 
the court would lack article III juris-
diction to entertain the dispute in 
question, but moot in the sense that 
they might lose their job, moot in the 
sense that they are going to have to 
face this awful Hobson’s choice be-
tween maintaining their ability to pro-
vide for their family, on the one hand, 
and, on the other hand, receiving a 
medical procedure that they would 
deem harmful and objectionable based 
on their religious or other sincerely 
held beliefs. This is not America; this 
is not acceptable; and this is not and 
cannot possibly be constitutional. 
We should be able to do this. 
I am going to be back tomorrow, the 
next day, and as long as it takes to 
keep addressing this issue. Freedom 
matters, and the Constitution matters. 
President Biden has ignored them both. 
Thank you.

Service, Class of Career Minister, to be

national Narcotics and Law Enforce-
ment Affairs). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we 
heard over the course of many hours 
last week and, indeed, over the many 
months that Foreign Affairs nominees 
have been languishing on the Senate 
floor, the concerns of the junior Sen-
ator from Texas related to the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline. We also have heard 
at length from Members of this body 
about the humanitarian situation in 
Afghanistan—from the junior Senator 
from Missouri. 
As I have said publicly and repeat-
edly, I share my colleague’s concerns 
about the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. He 
put up a series of my quotes. They are 
all true. I am still of that view, but I 
am not of the view that you stop the 
national security apparatus in order to 
pursue a policy difference and create a 
whole host of other serious risks for 
the United States. 
I believe and have said that the evac-
uation from Afghanistan was fatally 
flawed. In fact, the Foreign Relations 
Committee held a hearing and heard 
from Secretary Blinken about the situ-
ation in Afghanistan. The Foreign Re-
lations Committee is holding a briefing 
tomorrow about the administration’s 
efforts to bolster European energy se-
curity to counter Russia’s efforts in 
this area. And I intend to continue 
oversight of the situation in Afghani-
stan and why, over the course of 20 
years, we have failed. 
What I fail to understand is the rela-
tionship between the foreign affairs 
nominees pending before this body and 
those topics. These individuals are crit-
ical to confronting numerous other 
global challenges, promoting American 
values, 
and 
advancing 
the 
safety, 
health, and economic well-being of 
America. We need them confirmed 
today—today. 
I therefore will rise to seek unani-
mous consent for the confirmation of 
10 nominees, including seven career 
diplomats. 
Each 
of 
them 
moved 
through the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee with bipartisan support. There 
is no reason for Republicans to block 
their confirmation. 
Let me speak to them for a minute or 
two. 
This is especially the case at the U.S. 
Agency for International Development. 
The 
Administrator 
of 
USAID, 
Samantha Power, is the only member 
of that Agency’s senior leadership that 
has been confirmed by this body. Am-
bassador Power needs her senior lead-
ership team in place. Yet her two depu-
ties are languishing on the floor be-
cause of Republican holds. 
This Agency is grappling with the 
impact of the COVID–19 pandemic and 
other humanitarian emergencies that 
are ravaging the globe. It simply can-
not function at its best without senior 
leadership. So why is it that Repub-
licans 
insist 
on 
blocking 
Paloma 
Adams-Allen and Isobel Coleman, two 
highly qualified nominees to serve as 
USAID Deputy Administrators? 
Let me take a moment to once again 
raise Haiti. We hear a lot about Haiti 
here on the floor, particularly from our 
Republican colleagues, and the chal-
lenge at the border. 
Well, in August, a massive earth-
quake in Haiti killed more than 2,200 
people, injured 12,000 more, and de-
stroyed tens of thousands of buildings. 
This comes after the assassination of 
Haiti’s President. But here, again, Re-
publicans are holding a senior member 
of Ambassador Powers’ team, Marcela 
Escobari, the nominee to be the Assist-
ant Administrator for Latin America 
and the Caribbean at USAID. Escobari, 
who will manage our response to the 
Haiti earthquake, once confirmed, al-
ready held this very job in the Obama 
administration. Guess what. She was 
confirmed by voice vote then. 
Now we want to deal with the chal-
lenge of Haitian refugees coming to the 
border and other refugees of the hemi-
sphere coming to the border. Let’s con-
firm the USAID Deputy Administrator 
who will deal with that issue so we can 
deal with the root causes. How do we 
create stability in Haiti? How do we 
provide relief for the Haitian people? 
How do we create feeding for the Hai-
tian people so they are not fleeing 
their country? But, no, we are going to 
stop this nominee who is going to be at 
the very heart of that. So when you see 
a new group of Haitian refugees, blame 
yourself. 
We spent many months in this body 
talking about the challenges posed by 
the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China. The U.S. Innovation and

September 28, 2021 
Competition Act, passed by this body 
in June, and the Strategic Competition 
Act, which passed almost unanimously 
out of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, 21 to 1, are proof of that. We 
have collectively come together on this 
much: to recognize China as the great-
est geopolitical and geoeconomic chal-
lenge for U.S. foreign policy. We have 
rightfully focused on effectively con-
fronting Chinese malign influence. Yet 
we are failing to ensure a fundamen-
tally critical element of that strategy; 
that is, empowered leadership in our 
diplomatic corps across the world. 
Our former colleague Senator Ken 
Salazar is the only—hear me—the only 
Biden administration nominee who has 
been confirmed to serve as a country 
Ambassador representing U.S. interests 
abroad, the only one in the 9 months of 
this administration. 
Let me be clear. Holding up dip-
lomats is effectively ceding influence 
to China and actively undermining 
U.S. national security interests. People 
come to the floor and talk about China. 
Well, they are empowering China by 
not having our people in position to 
counter their influence. 
It is a fact that Congo and Angola 
owe over 40 percent of their entire na-
tional debt—to whom? To China. So I 
ask my colleagues, why have we not 
yet confirmed Tulinabo Mushingi, a ca-
reer Foreign Service officer, as our 
Ambassador to Angola? Why have we 
not yet confirmed Eugene Young, an-
other career Foreign Service officer, as 
our Ambassador to the Congo? 
China and Somalia have recently en-
tered into a new fishing agreement, 
and Chinese vessels are increasingly 
accessing Somalia’s waters and stra-
tegic coastline adjacent to the Red 
Sea. Why have we not confirmed Larry 
Andre, Jr., a career Foreign Service of-
ficer, as our Ambassador to Somalia? 
China’s influence is spread across the 
continent of Africa, including its Belt 
and Road Initiative, which is branded 
as a development initiative but being 
used by China to advance its own inter-
ests. Why have we not yet confirmed 
Elizabeth Aubin and Maria Brewer, two 
career Foreign Service officers, as our 
Ambassadors to Algeria and Lesotho, 
respectively? 
I spoke on the Senate floor several 
months ago about Chinese influence in 
Cameroon. We have not had an Amer-
ican Ambassador in Cameroon in over a 
year. Why have we not yet confirmed 
Christopher John Lamora, a career 
Foreign Service officer, as our Ambas-
sador to Cameroon? 
Vietnam sits on the border of China. 
It is on the frontlines of Chinese coer-
cion in the South China Sea. Why have 
we not yet confirmed Mark Knapper, a 
career Foreign Service officer, as our 
Ambassador to Vietnam? 
Colleagues, each of these nominees I 
mentioned deserves to be confirmed 
today, and our national security inter-
ests demand it. 
In pursuit of what I hope will be a 
recognition of that—because at some 
point, something is going to happen 
here in the world, in one of these coun-
tries or one of these regions. When it 
happens and we don’t have our rep-
resentative there, I think a Member 
who is objecting is going to have to 
live with that reality. 
Let me ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to consider the fol-
lowing nomination: Executive Calendar 
No. 336, Paloma Adams-Allen to be a 
Deputy 
Administrator 
of 
the 
U.S. 
Agency for International Development; 
that the nomination be confirmed; that 
the motion to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate; that no 
further motions be in order in terms of 
the nomination; that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action and the Senate then resume leg-
islative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Reserving the right to 
object, I appreciate the earnestness on 
this issue from my friend and colleague 
the Senator from New Jersey. He men-
tions that something could happen in 
the world, that something will happen 
in the world. Something, I submit to 
you, has happened in the world, and 
today we have been learning about it. I 
am talking about the crisis in Afghani-
stan, the debacle in Afghanistan. 
All day, the Senate has been hearing 
testimony in the Armed Services Com-
mittee from Secretary Austin, from 
General 
Milley, 
and 
from 
General 
McKenzie about how it came to be that 
13 American servicemembers are dead, 
169 civilians killed, and hundreds of 
Americans left behind enemy lines 
there as we still speak—the greatest 
foreign policy crisis that this country 
has seen since Vietnam. And those 
aren’t my words; those are the words— 
the comparison of the Democratic 
members of the committee who repeat-
edly referenced today Vietnam, the fall 
of Saigon. That is the level of crisis 
that we are dealing with. 
What accountability has there been 
for this crisis, for this debacle? Because 
‘‘crisis’’ isn’t even quite the right 
word. That sounds like a natural dis-
aster, as if it accidentally happened. 
That is not the case. This is a debacle, 
a failure of leadership in the first 
order, and what accountability has 
there been for it? Who has resigned? 
Who has been fired? Who has been re-
lieved of command? Nobody. What ac-
tions have the administration taken? 
None. 
What does Secretary Austin say 
today? He says: Well, we will take a 
hard look at ourselves, and we will ask 
some tough questions. 
Mr. President, that is not nearly 
good enough. Americans are dead. 
Americans are stranded behind enemy 
lines. Our foreign policies are in a state 
of collapse. Our national security is in 
a state of collapse. Enemies around the 
world are watching what is happening 
in Afghanistan, are seeing an oppor-
tunity as the United States shows 
weakness 
and 
disarray 
and 
chaos. 
There must be accountability. 
Let me say something more about 
what we learned today because we did 
learn quite a lot, and all of it is fright-
ening. We learned that the President of 
the United States lied. He lied when he 
said to the American people in an 
interview on television just a few 
weeks ago that he was never told by 
any of his military advisers—never told 
that a drawdown on this timetable, his 
timetable, would result in catastrophe. 
He was asked by George Stephan-
opoulos: 
Your top military advisers warned against 
withdrawing on this [timetable]. They want-
ed you to keep about 2,500 troops. 
President Biden: 
No, they didn’t. 
Stephanopoulos: 
They didn’t tell you that they wanted 
troops to stay? 
President Biden: 
No. 
Stephanopoulos: 
So no one told—your military advisers did 
not tell you, ‘‘No, we should just keep 2,500 
troops.’’ 
President Biden: 
No. No one said that to me that I can re-
call. 
Today, 
we 
heard 
from 
General 
Milley, General McKenzie, and Sec-
retary Austin, who—each of them said 
that they advised the President—it was 
their considered military judgment 
that the President’s plans were mis-
taken. They advised against it. They 
advised him against it. Yet he said: No, 
no one ever told me. I am not respon-
sible. No one ever told me. 
We also learned this: We learned that 
the President lied when he said that he 
had no idea that the Taliban would 
take over the country in such a short 
time period. 
From the same interview, George 
Stephanopoulos 
said 
to 
President 
Biden: 
Back in July, you said a Taliban takeover 
was highly unlikely. Was the intelligence 
wrong, or did you downplay it? 
Biden said: No. I think that there was 
no consensus. If you go back and look, 
they said it is not going to happen. 
Stephanopoulos: 
[But] you didn’t put a timeline on it when 
you said it was highly unlikely. You just flat 
out [said], ‘‘It’s highly unlikely the Taliban 
would take over.’’ 
President Biden said: 
Yeah. 
We learned today, in fact, that his 
commander on the ground, General 
Miller, warned as early as March, 
March of this year, that the military 
situation in Afghanistan was deterio-
rating rapidly; that the Taliban was on 
the offensive; that the drawdown of 
American troops would likely result in 
the collapse of the Afghan Government 
and the Afghan security forces sooner 
rather than later. It was going to come 
fast is what General Miller said. Yet

September 28, 2021 
the President says no one ever told him 
that. He never knew about it. In fact, 
his own commanders on the ground 
warned him about it. 
What was the consequence of this? 
Well, the President is either forgetting 
or ignoring or just outright lying about 
what he was advised by his own com-
manders. 
His administration was failing to 
plan for the collapse of the Afghan se-
curity forces. We learned that today 
too. Secretary Austin said: We just 
didn’t plan for a scenario of an Afghan 
security forces collapse. We didn’t plan 
for it. 
Why didn’t they plan for it? Why 
isn’t somebody being held accountable 
for it? 
The Special Inspector General for Af-
ghanistan has been warning for years 
that the Afghan security forces were 
not ready, that they were not well 
equipped, that they were not well 
trained, and that they would not likely 
stand on their own. We know that the 
commander on the ground shared the 
same assessment. Yet the administra-
tion did not plan for—by their own ad-
mission did not plan for the collapse of 
the Afghan security forces or the col-
lapse of the Afghan Government, which 
also meant that they did not order the 
evacuation of American civilians in 
time. They dilly-dallied. They waited. 
They dithered. They did not order the 
evacuation in time. They waited until 
the middle of August to undertake an 
evacuation of civilians in earnest, after 
American troops had withdrawn from 
the country. No wonder there was 
chaos in Kabul. No wonder there was a 
total disaster. That is the administra-
tion’s fault. They waited because they 
hadn’t planned. They waited because 
apparently they were fighting among 
themselves—the State Department, De-
fense Department, the White House— 
all fighting because President Biden 
wasn’t leading. It was a total debacle, 
total chaos. 
My friend the Senator from New Jer-
sey quite reasonably wants to know, 
what is the connection? Why I am ob-
jecting to these nominees? Why do I 
want a vote? 
Here is the connection: It is about ac-
countability. No one has been held ac-
countable. I note the Senator wants to 
hear from Secretary Austin in his com-
mittee. He should hear from the Sec-
retary in his committee because what 
we learned today contradicts quite a 
lot of the testimony that the Secretary 
of State gave to the Senator from New 
Jersey and his committee earlier— 
quite a lot of contradictions. He is 
quite right to want to hear from Sec-
retary Austin. 
We need to do more than hear from 
him; we need to have accountability 
for what has happened. Until we get 
that accountability, until someone is 
held responsible, until there is some 
turn, some change, some shift in pol-
icy—and I have called for the resigna-
tions of General Milley, Secretary Aus-
tin, Secretary Blinken, and the na-
tional security advisers, all of whom 
planned and executed this operation. 
Until there is accountability, I think 
the least the Senate can do is actually 
vote, take at least a vote on this floor 
for nominees to leadership position at 
the State Department and the Depart-
ment of Defense.

career Foreign Service officers who had 
absolutely 
nothing—nothing—to 
do 
with whatever decisions were made in 
Afghanistan, that is where the ac-
countability is going to come from? 
These are people who have com-
mitted their lives to serving the United 
States of America. They have com-
mitted their lives either in Republican 
or 
Democratic 
administrations. 
It 
doesn’t matter. They carry out the 
mission of the United States and its 
foreign policy as dictated by the Presi-
dent and Congress. They had nothing— 
nothing—Sao Tome and Principe? The 
Congo? Somalia? Algeria? Lesotho? 
Cameroon? Vietnam?—to do with the 
decisions in Afghanistan. Yet they are 
the ones we are going to extract a 
pound of flesh of accountability from— 
on people who had absolutely nothing 
to do with the decisions on Afghani-
stan and who have committed their 
lives to the career Foreign Service. 
These aren’t political nominees. These 
are career Foreign Service officers. 
I heard my colleague talk about— 
that our enemies around the world are 
emboldened. Well, guess what. They 
are really going to be emboldened when 
we have no Ambassador to counter 
them in these countries, because they 
have gotten clear sailing. They can do 
whatever they want. They can talk to 
those heads of state. 
There is no American Ambassador to 
go in and talk to that head of state and 
say: Mr. President or Mr. Prime Min-
ister—whatever the title may be—don’t 
make that choice. It would be a bad 
choice. We offer you a different alter-
native. We offer you a different set of 
principles, a different set of values— 
ones that would inure to the benefit of 
your country. 
But no, there is no one from the 
United States of America who is going 
to be able to go into those countries 
and say any of that, because we are 
going to extract—when I say ‘‘we,’’ I 
should retract that. The Senator from 
Missouri wants to extract account-
ability on people who have done abso-
lutely nothing as it relates to making 
these decisions. 
When we have problems in this hemi-
sphere with migration, I want my col-
leagues to know, who are objecting, 
that they will bear a significant part of 
the responsibility, because if we can’t 
deal with the root causes to stop people 
from coming to our southern border, 
whether they be from Haiti or Central 
America or any other place, then we 
are going to continuously have a flow 
of people as they avoid disaster, civil 
conflict, authoritarian governments. 
But, if we had people in place to de-
velop the plans and the programs and 
implement them so we could stop the 
flow and so we could create stability in 
Haiti—guess what—we are less likely 
to have people come to the southern 
border. But, no, we are going to extract 
accountability on people who have ab-
solutely nothing to do with Afghani-
stan. 
Not only is this shortsighted, but for 
those who stand on the Senate floor 
and talk about the national security of 
the United States, this hurts the na-
tional security of the United States. It 
hurts the national interests of the 
United States. 
So I hope that there will be a reflec-
tion. Maybe there are better targets to 
pick than career Foreign Service offi-
cers in countries that have no decision, 
no policymaking on any of these issues 
that my colleague has a problem with. 
Maybe there are better ones to pursue. 
In the absence of that, I will tell you 
there is going to be a rude awakening. 
Mark my words. I have been doing for-
eign policy for 30 years between the 
House and the Senate. It will happen 
sooner than you think, and you will re-
member this moment and wish you 
hadn’t objected to some of these peo-
ple. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I have spo-
ken throughout these last several days 
about how the Nord Stream 2 pipe-
line—the 
Biden-Putin 
pipeline—runs 
counter to everything that the Biden 
administration professes to stand for, 
and, indeed, what much of the Demo-
cratic Party has been insisting for the 
last half decade are the most impor-
tant issues of the country. 
We, of course, spent 4 years, during 
the Trump Presidency, listening to 
Democrats say, ‘‘Russia, Russia, Rus-
sia,’’ over and over and over again. It 
was a newfound discovery. Some of us 
are old enough to remember Barack 
Obama turning to MITT ROMNEY in the 
2012 Presidential election when MITT 
ROMNEY was advocating for strength in 
dealing with Russia and for taking on 
Putin, and some of us remember 
Obama looking at MITT ROMNEY and 
saying: 
[Mitt], the 1980s called. They want their 
foreign policy back. 
That was in 2012, when the Demo-
crats thought it was passe to stand up 
to Russia. 
Then 2016 happened, and Donald 
Trump was elected President. Sud-
denly, the Democratic Party got reli-
gion. Suddenly, Russia was bad. Now, I 
thought Russia was bad before. I 
thought Russia was bad when Trump 
was President. And I think Russia is 
bad now. I don’t like dictatorial thugs 
like Vladimir Putin, who is a KGB 
thug. 
But, interestingly, for our friends on 
the Democratic side of the aisle, their 
outrage against Russia is situational. 
It applies only in the situation that a 
Republican is in the White House. 
When a Democrat is in the White 
House—when Joe Biden is there—sud-
denly, Putin is hunky-dory. Suddenly, 
Democrats don’t have much of a prob-
lem with Joe Biden defying Federal 
law, ignoring Federal law, and giving a 
multibillion-dollar gift to Putin. 
Suddenly, the Democrats have given 
all of these speeches on Russia, who 
passed CAATSA. I talked earlier about 
CAATSA, the legislation that imposes 
mandatory sanctions on Russia to stop 
a President who refuses to impose 
those sanctions. Well, Joe Biden is in 
defiance of CAATSA. Do you see a sin-
gle Democrat standing up, saying: Mr. 
President, obey CAATSA? No. They are 
whining that the deputy assistant 
under secretary of whatchamacallit 
has not been confirmed yesterday, and, 
clearly, the world is going to come to 
an end without a deputy assistant of 
whatchamacallit. 
If our Democratic colleagues believed 
their rhetoric of the last 4 years, we 
would see Democrats stand up with me 
and say, ‘‘Joe Biden’s multibillion-dol-
lar gift to Putin is a mistake,’’ but 
they are not. 
One of the ironies, in addition to the 
‘‘Russia, Russia, Russia’’ thing—and 
the truth of the matter—is most of the 
Democrats never believed Russia, Rus-
sia, Russia. If you go back to the So-
viet Union, if you go back to the 
Reagan administration, the Democrats 
had spent decades as apologists for So-
viet Communists, as apologists for 
Russian dictators. But for 4 years, I 
have got to say that our Democratic 
colleagues can give a good speech. 
They sure sounded genuine when they 
said, ‘‘Russia, Russia, Russia.’’ But if 
they believed those words, then they 
would look at Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS, and they would say, ‘‘Russia, 
Russia, Russia.’’ 
By the way, they didn’t like Donald 
Trump’s rhetoric on Russia, and by the 
way, I didn’t like a lot of the things 
President Trump said on Russia. I wish 
his rhetoric had been stronger, but it is 
worth noting that Trump had the cour-
age to call out Germany for Nord 
Stream 2. Trump had the courage to 
impose sanctions under the bipartisan 
sanctions legislation we passed into 
law. 
The 
Cruz-Shaheen 
legislation 
passed in 2019, and the second wave of 
the Cruz-Shaheen bipartisan legisla-
tion passed in 2020. President Trump 
imposed. What did Joe Biden do? 
Waived it. What did Joe Biden do? Ig-
nored the law. What did Joe Biden do? 
He gave a multibillion-dollar gift to 
Putin. 
So, if any Democrat meant a word 
they said about Russia, we have got to 
see them standing here. You will note 
the Democratic side of the floor is 
largely empty. 
But not only is Joe Biden’s rhetoric 
and the Democrats’ rhetoric on Russia 
not matched by their action, but we 
also know that Biden’s actions don’t 
meet the Democrats’ rhetoric on cli-
mate. 
ENVIRONMENTALISM AND CLIMATE 
Mr. President, what I want to address 
now is environmentalism and climate, 
which President Biden and the left 
tells us are existential issues. 
There is nothing mattering more, 
they say, than climate change; that if 
we don’t fight climate change, Ne-
braska is going to be underwater, they 
tell us. They say we need to follow the 
example of our European allies in

September 28, 2021 
agreements like the Paris accords, but 
the Nord Stream 2 pipeline will grind 
any European energy transition to a 
halt by making the Europeans even 
more dependent on Russian gas. 
Now, some proponents have argued 
that the natural gas delivered by Nord 
Stream 2 could be kind of a transition 
technology, but the German Institute 
for Economic Research’s senior energy 
expert described Nord Stream 2 on 
these issues as ‘‘unnecessary and ineffi-
cient.’’ 
More analysis, published again just 
last week, projected that the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline would emit over 100 
million metric tons of CO2 per year, 
plus fugitive methane. 
The gas that Nord Stream 2 would 
deliver compares very badly to the al-
ternative, and that is LNG, liquid nat-
ural gas. 
In 2019, the U.S. Department of Ener-
gy’s National Energy Technology Lab 
published a study showing that ‘‘U.S. 
LNG shipped to European markets has 
41 percent less lifecycle emissions than 
if those same countries were to receive 
natural gas from another predominant 
producer like Russia.’’ 
Listen to that again because our 
Democratic colleagues love to pound 
the table how carbon is the greatest 
threat on the planet. 
Well, Joe Biden is saddling Europe 
with an energy option that produces 
much more CO2 than American LNG. 
American LNG, 41 percent less carbon 
dioxide. 
If they believe their rhetoric, you 
would see Democrats standing up to 
Joe Biden. If Joe Biden believed his 
rhetoric, I guess you would see Joe 
Biden standing up to himself. 
If John Kerry believed his rhetoric, 
in between his flights on a private jet, 
where John Kerry has the carbon foot-
print of a small town, in between his 
pontificating and lecturing American 
workers they just need to learn to 
code, if John Kerry believed climate 
was this existential disaster, he would 
be 
standing 
up, 
saying: 
President 
Biden, why are you defying Congress, 
defying the European Union, and giv-
ing Putin a multibillion-dollar gift 
that produces more CO2? 
There is no argument from the left or 
the right under which Nord Stream 2 is 
a good idea, but especially on the basis 
of what the left tells us are their most 
important issues: Russia, Russia, Rus-
sia. It is a disaster on Russia, Russia, 
Russia. 
CO2? It is a disaster on CO2. 
You know, Twitter today has lit up 
with a certain European teenager who 
is fond of lecturing the world about in-
sufficient fealty to climate. And she re-
sponded to American leaders who, to 
use her words, say ‘‘blah, blah, blah’’ 
when it comes to climate. 
I got to say, our Democratic col-
leagues, this Democratic administra-
tion, when it comes to Nord Stream 2, 
their only answer is: Blah, blah, blah. 
They don’t have an answer that they 
are resulting in—what was the figure 
again? Let’s actually get that figure 
right—100 million metric tons of CO2 
per year. 
Congratulations. The next time you 
give a speech saying that you want to 
double Americans’ electricity bills, you 
want to bankrupt working families be-
cause of CO2, remember, you didn’t 
seem worried about it when it was the 
Russians producing the CO2 in a way 
that hurts Europe, hurts our allies, and 
hurts America. 
Look, I get party politics. People 
want to stand and support their party. 
I get it. When there is a Republican 
President, Republicans support them, 
generally. When there is a Democratic 
President, Democrats support them, 
generally. That is the way it works. 
That is not terribly shocking. 
But is it asking too much for even 
one of the Democrats to believe what 
they have said for the last 5 years? 
Throughout the course of these re-
marks, you know who I have quoted 
more than anyone else? 
Senate Democrats. I have quoted 
their own remarks. 
Senate Democrats understand Nord 
Stream 2 is a disaster. They under-
stand it is harmful. They understand it 
is bad for America. Where they just 
can’t screw up the courage is when it 
comes to standing up to a Democratic 
President. 
By the way, they are perfectly happy 
to yell at Donald Trump. I get that. 
And to be clear, when we had a Repub-
lican President in Donald Trump, I 
pressed the Trump administration hard 
on Nord Stream 2, even though we are 
the same party. I was not remotely shy 
about pressing the Trump administra-
tion. 
There are 50 Democrats in this Cham-
ber. Is there one who believed Russia, 
Russia, Russia? Or was that all empty 
politics? Is there one who believes their 
hyperbolic rhetoric on CO2
and cli-
mate? Or is that all just blah, blah, 
blah? 
It is real simple. The Biden adminis-
tration has a chance to fix this. Just 
this weekend, the German people voted 
out the Merkel government. The entire 
reason Joe Biden went down this fool-
hardy disastrous path was to kiss up to 
Angela Merkel. Well, you know what. 
She is gone. Her party is gone. They 
are out of power. And so Joe Biden and 
KAMALA
HARRIS
have been given a 
present—a present of the chance to pull 
victory out of the jaws of defeat. 
We had victory from 2019 to 2020, 
where we shut down the pipeline. Re-
publicans and Democrats together in 
Congress had come together and shut 
down the pipeline. Putin had lost; 
America had won. 
Joe Biden comes into office, and now 
Putin wins, America loses. That ain’t 
good. That ain’t good in Michigan. It 
ain’t good in Arizona. It ain’t good in 
any State in this country. And Joe 
Biden can fix it if he simply accepts 
the gifts the German voters have given 
him, reverse his course, and follow his 
U.S. law. 
Let’s stop the Biden-Putin pipeline. 
Let’s give an opportunity for President 
Biden to pull his name off the pipeline. 
By the way, if he were to do so, I will 
come to this floor and I will sing Joe 
Biden’s praises for doing the right 
thing, for following the law, for stand-
ing up for America, for standing up to 
Russia, for defending our European al-
lies. 
But, sadly, I am not holding my 
breath. I think the hubris of office, 
stubbornness, is likely to keep the 
Biden administration digging in. 
In the Senate, I am going to use 
every tool I have to try to press them 
to change their minds. And I would call 
on—is there even one Democrat with 
the courage to take on Russia? 
Time will tell. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to point out 
the failures of the Biden administra-
tion’s foreign policies, and specifically 
President Biden’s failures in addition 
to that of his administration, because 
President Biden ran for President 
based on basically two things: what he 
described as his competence and as his 
foreign policy expertise. 
He has failed miserably at both. It 
has been nearly a month since Presi-
dent Biden withdrew from Afghanistan. 
And what about the Taliban? 
Well, right now, they are more pow-
erful than ever. They have billions and 
billions of dollars’ worth of high-tech 
military equipment. It is beyond their 
wildest dreams. 
Where did they get their weapons? 
Well, they got them from the United 
States of America. 
As we hear on nightly news broad-
casts, and as we know from what we 
are hearing at home, there are hun-
dreds of Americans still stranded be-
hind enemy lines. The administration 
doesn’t want to admit a number, but 
there 
are 
hundreds 
of 
Americans 
stranded behind enemy lines, if not 
more. 
The detrimental consequences for 
America are only beginning. 
Our friends are furious. And our en-
emies? They are emboldened by what 
has happened in Afghanistan. 
Earlier this month, I visited with our 
NATO allies. Our allies are enraged. 
And a host of foreign policy mistakes 
by President Biden, in my opinion and 
in theirs, are irreversible. 
Here are just a few examples: 
Angela Merkel’s designated successor 
in Germany called our Afghanistan 
withdrawal ‘‘the biggest debacle’’ in 
the history of NATO.

S6733 
September 28, 2021 
President Biden didn’t mind offend-
ing our Canadian allies when he shut 
down 
the 
Keystone 
XL 
Pipeline. 
Months later, he gave Vladimir Putin 
the green light to build the Nord 
Stream 2 Pipeline, and we just heard 
Senator CRUZ talking about that. 
Remember, this pipeline is a geo-
political weapon that Putin is going to 
use to hold our European allies hos-
tage—hostage for money and hostage 
for energy. 
President Duda in Poland, he said re-
cently the Nord Stream 2 giveaway is 
‘‘grounds for reflection on relations 
with the United States.’’ 
France was so offended with Presi-
dent Biden, at one point they recalled 
their ambassador. Never happened in 
American history. Go back all the way 
to the 1700s. France is a nuclear power. 
It is one of our closest allies. 
This is Presidential incompetence on 
an unprecedented scale. Our allies see 
the incompetence. Our enemies not 
only see it, they can smell it. China 
has said so publicly that Afghanistan 
shows Americans cannot defend our al-
lies anymore. 
Now China is threatening Taiwan and 
building more than 200 missile silos. 
Iran has accelerated its nuclear pro-
gram. According to Israel, Iran is only 
a few weeks away from having enough 
material to build a nuclear weapon. 
And on the 20th anniversary of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, American troops in 
Iraq were attacked. 
Russia is preparing to test a nuclear 
cruise missile near the Arctic Circle. 
North Korea is expanding uranium 
enrichment; and just days after Amer-
ica withdrew from Afghanistan, North 
Korea tested two ballistic missiles. 
In every area and region of the world, 
our Nation—America’s interests are in 
retreat. Our enemies are on the march. 
America has grown weaker under Joe 
Biden; our enemies have grown strong-
er under Joe Biden. 
Because of President Biden’s incom-
petence, mismanagement, and weak-
ness, we are all, as citizens of this 
country, less safe. 
When I think of the last 8 months, I 
am reminded of something that former 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates 
said. And, remember, he was Secretary 
of Defense under President Obama. 
He said: ‘‘Joe Biden has been wrong 
on nearly every major foreign policy 
and national security issue of the past 
four decades.’’ 
Forty years of being wrong on nearly 
every major foreign policy and na-
tional security issue. At the time he 
said that, it had been four decades. 
Now Joe Biden is President of the 
United States, and it is five decades. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CHINA 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, last 
week, President Biden went to the 
United Nations and he announced his 
capitulation to the Chinese Communist 
Party. The message was clear from 
what he did—and did not—say. 
In Joe Biden’s 30-minute-long mono-
logue on the state of the world, he 
never once even said the name of the 
world’s greatest threat to peace, sta-
bility, and democracy: China. He never 
said it once. He refused to even say the 
word ‘‘China.’’ Nor did he mention 
Tibet, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or prac-
tically any of the victims of Chinese 
communist aggression. 
Now, President Biden did mention 
the ‘‘targeting and oppression’’ of mi-
norities in Xinjiang Province in Chi-
na’s northwest, yet he left mysteri-
ously vague who was responsible for all 
that 
targeting 
and 
oppression. 
He 
blithely lumped Xinjiang with other 
abuses around the world as if it was 
just one area of deep concern among 
many. 
But the concentration camps in 
Xinjiang are not just another problem. 
They are proof of the most systematic 
genocide and ethnic cleansing cam-
paign occurring in the world today, 
perpetrated by one of the most ad-
vanced and powerful regimes on Earth, 
personally approved by the Chinese 
Communist leader Xi Jinping. Leaked 
documents make it clear that Chair-
man Xi is responsible for this campaign 
of genocide and ethnic cleansing. 
Let me explain how brutal it is. The 
Chinese Communist Party are steri-
lizing women in Xinjiang Province so 
they cannot procreate and create more 
of their ethnic minority. If they can’t 
do that, then they are being brutally 
raped by Han Chinese men. That is 
what is happening in Xinjiang Prov-
ince, in addition to the internment of 
millions of religious and ethnic minori-
ties. It is not just your run-of-the-mill 
targeting and oppression. 
President Biden also referred to 
China implicitly—because he didn’t say 
the word—on another occasion in his 
speech when he said that the United 
States is ‘‘not seeking a new Cold 
War.’’ 
Of course, we are not seeking a war 
of any kind, cold or hot. That is the 
last thing that the United States would 
ever want. But, still, that is an aston-
ishing assertion, because whether we 
seek it or not, China has been waging a 
Cold War on America and our workers 
and our factories and our militaries 
and our way of life for decades. The 
only question is whether we will win or 
lose. Under President Biden, we are los-
ing. 
A strong leader—a competent lead-
er—would seek to win this Cold War 
thrust upon the United States in the 
manner of those who went before us 
facing enemies like Nazi Germany, Im-
perial Japan, and Soviet Russia. In-
stead, in the manner of appeasers the 
world over, President Biden hopes to 
make peace with China by indulging its 
aggression and refusing to even say his 
name. 
Now, if you think this is restoring 
some norm of longstanding providence, 
that you don’t go to the United Na-
tions General Assembly and speak the 
name of your adversaries who are com-
mitting acts of naked aggression and 
crimes against humanity, I would point 
out that Barack Obama repeatedly—re-
peatedly—called out Russia by name in 
2014 for its invasion of Ukraine, and 
let’s just say that President Obama 
was not exactly a Cold warrior. 
Now as a result, Chairman Xi is 
issuing imperious orders, and the Biden 
administration is rushing to fill them 
like a short-order cook at a diner on 
Saturday morning. Early in his admin-
istration, President Biden lifted re-
strictions 
on 
Confucius 
Institutes, 
which are little more than spy outposts 
on our universities. He gutted Trump- 
era rules protecting our electrical grid 
from Chinese influence, and he shut 
down a State Department investigation 
into 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
Wuhan 
coronavirus. 
Then, in July, China’s Foreign Min-
ister handed two lists of new demands 
to Deputy Secretary of State Wendy 
Sherman, 
stating 
that 
the 
United 
States must stop so-called wrongdoings 
in order to get back in Beijing’s good 
graces. 
Similarly, when the so-called climate 
czar, John Kerry, asked for China’s 
help, the Communist Party responded 
that it would consider polluting a little 
less if the United States would shut up 
about China’s campaign of genocide 
and other human rights abuses. 
Now any self-respecting administra-
tion 
that 
believes 
in 
American 
strength, pride, and honor would have 
told Chairman Xi that he is in no posi-
tion to be making such demands. In-
stead, this administration is going 
down the page, ticking off boxes like 
an obedient underling. 
When a reporter asked John Kerry if 
the administration would press China 
on its horrific human rights abuses, 
Kerry responded that, ‘‘life is always 
full of tough choices.’’ 
Pathetic. 
Around the same time, Biden’s Com-
merce Secretary called for ‘‘robust 
commercial engagement’’ and to ‘‘miti-
gate any potential tensions’’ between 
United States and China. She even 
promised to bring delegations of U.S. 
business leaders to China to pad the 
Communist bottom line even further. 
She calls to mind what is attributed 
to Lenin: that capitalists will sell Com-
munists the rope they will use to hang 
us all. 
Pathetic. 
Over the weekend, in his most recent 
act of pathetic weakness, the Biden De-
partment 
of 
Justice 
surrendered 
Huawei’s criminal CFO and princess, 
Meng Wanzhou, without punishing her 
for evading U.S. sanctions. She re-
ceived a hero’s welcome when her plane

touched down in China. And moments 
after her release, China released two 
innocent Canadians it had taken hos-
tage to secure Meng’s release. So Bei-
jing’s hostage-taking worked exactly 
as planned. Pathetic. 
All of this self-inflicted humiliation 
was avoidable. The fact is that China is 
in no position to deliver ultimatums to 
us. It is America that ought to be mak-
ing demands to China. 
Here’s a few things that would actu-
ally pave a path to true reconciliation: 
First and foremost, we ought to de-
mand that China finally admit what al-
most everyone knows is certainly true: 
that the coronavirus pandemic started 
in a lab in Wuhan. Xi Jinping should 
then give a groveling televised apology 
to the world, agree to end all gain-of- 
function research using deadly patho-
gens, and pay damages to his victims 
around the world who have died or suf-
fered because of his regime’s incom-
petence and malevolence. 
Second, we ought to demand that 
China rebid the 2022 Winter Olympics 
until the Chinese regime ends its eth-
nic cleansing, slave labor, mass mur-
der, mass sterilization, and systematic 
rape of ethnic and religious minorities. 
It is too morally tainted to host such a 
prestigious event. 
Third, we ought to demand that 
China end its spree of intellectual 
property theft. Today, China is respon-
sible for up to 80 percent—80 percent— 
of intellectual property theft com-
mitted against the United States, and 
is the subject of nearly half of all FBI 
counterintelligence cases for economic 
espionage. This theft has to stop. 
Fourth, 
we 
should 
demand 
that 
China renounce its imperial ambitions. 
It must agree to stop the Belt and 
Road Initiative, disclaim its ambition 
of conquering Taiwan, abide by its 
treaty 
obligations 
regarding 
Hong 
Kong, and end its sinister and provoca-
tive military buildup. 
If these conditions are met, China 
will be on the path of making amends 
for its many crimes. It is up to Amer-
ica to hold China accountable for these 
crimes. After all, we are the global 
leader, not China. We don’t require 
China’s forgiveness or favor. Our con-
science is clean. 
Our Nation is great. We are the Na-
tion that threw off the shackles of an 
empire, settled a continent, saved the 
world, and then saved it again and 
again. The United States has been the 
greatest enemy of tyranny the world 
over. We do not cower before tyrants. 
We look them in the eye and call them 
by their true name and tell them what 
they really are: evil. 
President Biden ought to remember 
that the next time he speaks to the 
world on behalf of the American peo-
ple. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO ANTHONY K. 
STAMPER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of 
the most ubiquitous technologies in 
the world today is the cell phone. Ac-
cording to Pew Research, a stunning 97 
percent of Americans own some sort of 
mobile device. These devices are crit-
ical to our everyday lives, keeping us 
connected to one another while also 
serving as a gateway to entire sectors 
of our economy. Most Americans prob-
ably do not realize that they are hold-
ing a piece of Vermont in their hands 
every time they use their phone, but 
thanks 
to 
engineers 
at 
GlobalFoundries in Essex Junction, 
every cell phone in the world contains 
a chip manufactured in my home 
State. 
Today, I would like to take a mo-
ment to acknowledge the efforts of one 
of those engineers, Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ 
Stamper of Burlington and thank him 
for his contributions to the global in-
novation ecosystem from his corner of 
Vermont. Tony retired this summer 
from GlobalFoundries after 30 years of 
semiconductor 
engineering 
at 
the 
Essex facility. During Tony’s cele-
brated career, he has been responsible 
for over 500 patented inventions, mak-
ing him one of the world’s top 100 most 
prolific inventors of all time. 
Tony’s leadership at GlobalFoundries 
has helped keep Vermont at the fore-
front of an ever-changing industry for 
over 70 years. In 2015, GlobalFoundries 
acquired IBM’s Essex plant and their 
talented workforce. Thanks to Tony 
and Essex innovators like him, the 
Vermont 
GlobalFoundries 
facility 
leads the industry in manufacturing 
radio frequency power semiconductors. 
While Tony has been a prolific inven-
tor, U.S. Patent No. 6,310,300 is one of 
his most notable inventions. It solved 
the significant problem that the space 
between an insulation layer and a 
metal wire in a chip would degrade 
over time. He and his team members 
created a barrier layer that prevented 
degradation and allowed for much 
smaller metal wires on the chip, hence 
much smaller chips. The invention has 
been used in every chip produced in the 
last 20 years. 
Tony is not only an accomplished in-
ventor but has repeatedly led teams of 
engineers to utilize these inventions to 
create leading edge products for high- 
speed computing and mobile commu-
nications. Tony has been a dedicated 
mentor and teacher to a new genera-
tion of inventors, which led him to be 
nominated for the GlobalFoundries Di-
versity 
and 
Inclusion 
Inventorship 
Champion Award. He knows that col-
laboration is the key ingredient to suc-
cessful innovation and has fostered 
that kind of environment in all of the 
invention teams he has led. 
Tony’s story shows that innovators 
can thrive anywhere in the country, 
not just in Silicon Valley. I know his 
fellow engineers, who have relied on his 
expertise over the years, will feel his 
absence and miss him dearly. As he em-
barks on this next exciting part of his 
life, I want to acknowledge Tony’s 
work and thank him for his decades of 
service to Vermont and the industry. 
Marcelle and I join his friends at 
GlobalFoundries and wish him the best 
of luck.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
FARM 
TO 
SCHOOL PROGRAM AT HARWOOD 
UNION HIGH SCHOOL 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would 
like to take a moment today to recog-
nize the incredible impact of Farm to 
School 
programs 
in 
Vermont 
and 
across the country and the great work 
of Vermont students, their schools, and 
their broader communities to improve 
access to healthy food options. 
Since 2000, Vermont Food Education 
Every Day—FEED—has facilitated col-
laboration between schools and farms 
in 
Vermont, 
helping 
cafeterias 
to 
source meals locally and working with 
schools to institute curricular and co-
curricular programming to educate 
students on local food systems. In 2010, 
I was proud to author the national 
Farm 
to 
School 
Program 
in 
the 
Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act. Since 
then, Vermont FEED and its Farm to 
School programs have become a na-
tional 
benchmark, 
with 
Farm 
to 
School programs now operating in all 
50 States and the District of Columbia. 
A few weeks ago, I had the chance to 
speak with students from Harwood 
Union High School about their Farm to 
School program. For the past 15 years, 
Harwood has sourced its food locally 
and worked with Vermont FEED to de-
velop opportunities for students, teach-
ers, and staff to connect with local 
farmers beyond the cafeteria. For 5 
years, Harwood’s student-led Farm to 
School 
Club 
has 
coordinated 
edu-
cational programming, farm visits, and 
recipe competitions to help students 
and staff to experience local agri-
culture and the Vermont food system. 
Even through the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the Harwood Farm to School Club 
adapted its programming by shifting to 
virtual tours of local farms and at- 
home recipe contests. 
As a truly Vermont-grown initiative, 
I have always been proud of the impres-
sive adoption of Farm to School pro-
grams in communities nationwide. In 
April, I reintroduced the Farm to 
School Act, a bipartisan piece of legis-
lation that would increase mandatory 
funding for the Farm to School Grant 
Program, ensuring that more schools, 
students, and farmers can take advan-
tage of the program. And every year in 
the annual appropriations process, I 
have worked to increase discretionary 
funding for this popular program. 
The Farm to School Club at Harwood 
serves as a testament to the impor-
tance of community engagement and 
the educational, economic, and nutri-
tional benefits of Farm to School pro-
grams. The club was recently featured 
in an article published by Seven Days, 
and I ask unanimous consent that the 
article, 
‘‘Vermont 
Leads 
National 
Farm-to-School Movement, and Har-
wood Union High School Demonstrates 
How’’ be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Seven Days, Sept. 7, 2021] 
VERMONT LEADS NATIONAL FARM-TO-SCHOOL 
MOVEMENT, 
AND
HARWOOD
UNION
HIGH 
SCHOOL DEMONSTRATES HOW 
(By Melissa Pasanen) 
On August 19 at Shelburne Farms, Sen. 
Patrick Leahy (D–Vt.) and U.S. Department 
of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack heard 
from 10 Vermonters involved with the state’s 
farm-to-school program. 
The group included school food service di-
rectors, nonprofit and government leaders in 
agriculture and child nutrition, a vegetable 
farmer, and Jeswin Antony, a 16-year-old 
Harwood Union High School student. 
When it was Antony’s turn to speak, he in-
troduced himself as a leader of Harwood’s 
farm-to-school club. The teen explained that 
he was 3 when his family moved from India 
to Waterbury. ‘‘My first experiences with 
American cuisine were in the lunchroom at 
school,’’ he said. 
The chicken was Vermont-raised, and the 
vegetables were grown in the school garden, 
Antony recounted. ‘‘From a young age, I was 
taught and I saw that this food is grown lo-
cally, and it tastes better and is more nutri-
tious,’’ he said.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6736 
September 28, 2021 
The Shelburne gathering followed Leahy’s 
early August announcement that he had se-
cured committee approval to include $5 mil-
lion in the federal budget to establish a Na-
tional 
Farm-to-School 
Institute 
at 
Shelburne Farms. 
The proposed national institute will ex-
pand the reach of the existing Vermont- 
based Northeast Farm to School Institute 
currently run by Vermont FEED (Food Edu-
cation Every Day), a nonprofit partnership 
managed by Shelburne Farms and the North-
east 
Organic 
Farming 
Association 
of 
Vermont. 
Founded in 2000, Vermont FEED has been 
instrumental in fostering connections be-
tween Vermont schools and farms—from the 
cafeteria to the classroom—in support of im-
proved childhood nutrition, local agriculture 
and lifelong wellness. 
The organization’s influence spread beyond 
the state’s borders until it was codified when 
Vermont FEED established the Northeast 
Farm to School Institute in 2010. The insti-
tute has helped share best practices via 
training and coaching in more than 100 
schools and districts in New England and 
New York. 
States from Massachusetts to Nebraska 
have also worked with the Northeast Farm 
to School Institute to build their own suc-
cessful statewide programs. 
Shortly after the Mississippi Farm to 
School Network was established in 2015, co- 
director Sunny Baker visited Vermont for a 
workshop. 
‘‘We knew right away Vermont was the 
model,’’ Baker said over the phone. ‘‘It’s not 
one-size-fits-all. It’s about putting power 
back into the communities while providing 
formal support to help them connect the 
three Cs,’’ she said, referring to cafeteria, 
classroom and community. ‘‘It’s less top- 
down, more roots-up.’’ 
Anna Mullen, spokesperson for the Na-
tional Farm to School Network, described 
Vermont as a national leader in creating and 
propagating effective farm-to-school models 
and in leveraging critical legislative support. 
In a phone interview, she noted that the 
state was the first to create a farm-to-school 
grant program in 2006 and that Leahy has 
long been ‘‘a huge champion’’ of the move-
ment at the federal level. 
The pending federal line item would fund 
expansion of ‘‘a really impactful . . . coach-
ing and support model that brings together 
teams to fit the needs of their school and 
achieve the vision of their own community,’’ 
Mullen said. The proposal to take it national 
‘‘is a testament to a model that’s really 
helping and working. 
At Shelburne Farms in August, Antony 
continued to share why he was drawn to 
farm-to-school. In middle school, he said, he 
took a sustainability course that taught him 
about the food system. Joining the farm-to- 
school club deepened his understanding of 
the ‘‘inner workings’’ of how schools source 
and prepare food, Antony explained. 
During the pandemic, he and his co leaders 
worked hard to keep fellow members con-
nected to the club and to one another 
through virtual farm tours and Harvest of 
the Month recipe contests, Antony said. 
They created recipes with beets, sweet pota-
toes and dairy at home, for example, and 
then took virtual tours of farms that pro-
duced those foods. 
‘‘Keeping the students engaged, telling 
them where their food comes from, making 
them informed about what they eat really 
creates a better environment and healthier 
kids,’’ Antony concluded. 
‘‘I wish I’d had you testify before the com-
mittees,’’ Leahy said, drawing an appre-
ciative chuckle from the group. 
A couple weeks after meeting the senator 
and agriculture secretary, Antony met with 
Seven Days in the Harwood cafeteria along 
with three other teens in the farm-to-school 
club. Joining the four were Paul Morris, co- 
director of food and nutrition services for 
the Harwood Unified Union School District; 
Paul Kramer, a teacher and club faculty ad-
viser; and Jen Dreimiller, a school counselor 
who is also on Harwood’s farm-to-school 
team. That team is composed of teachers, 
staff, students and community members 
working to deepen the high school’s farm-to- 
school efforts. 
Like Antony, Miranda Rayfield of Fayston 
and Macie Whalen of Northfield are 16 and 
just started 11th grade. The trio leads the 
club. The students look forward to getting 
back into the cafeteria kitchen with ‘‘chef 
Paul,’’ as they call Morris, to design, prepare 
and serve Harvest of the Month taste tests. 
While they enjoyed the monthly recipe con-
tests that Antony had described to Leahy 
and Vilsack, sharing the results of their ef-
forts remotely wasn’t the same. 
‘‘We provided the food, and [members of 
the school community] got to make some-
thing out of it and share it via a slideshow 
we’d show at an online school assembly,’’ 
Whalen explained. Photographs of beet rec-
ipes included a mouthwatering array of sev-
eral different beet-chocolate cakes; beet- 
tahini pasta; a beet and potato roesti; and a 
version of halwa, the traditional Indian 
sweet, made with beets. 
‘‘Some people think vegetable are ‘gross 
and disgusting,’ ’’ Whalen said. ‘‘But then 
when they cook with them and see or taste 
what others have made, they might change 
their mind.’’ 
‘‘When you share it with the whole school, 
it gets more attention,’’ Antony added. 
During the pandemic, the students drew 
other benefits from their shared cooking ex-
perience. ‘‘You were at home, locked down. 
It gave us a great way to connect,’’ Whalen 
said. ‘‘Like, Jeswin’s sweet potato and black 
bean curry—it looked so good! [We were ask-
ing each other,] ‘Did he send the recipe?’ It 
was really cool to be connected through 
food.’’ 
Haley MacDonald, 13, of Moretown, joined 
the club last year when she was in seventh 
grade. With the kale she received through 
the club, she made two kinds of kale chips at 
home: one salted and the other sweetened 
with a little maple syrup. 
‘‘It was my first time making them my-
self,’’ MacDonald said proudly in the cafe-
teria. Her family, including her 9-year-old 
twin brothers, inhaled them. ‘‘They were 
gone in a minute.’’ 
‘‘It also helped me realize there are lots of 
local farms,’’ MacDonald said. ‘‘Like, ‘Oh, I 
got kale from there.’ It’s really cool to be 
able to cook with what they grow and sup-
port them.’’ 
During a virtual farm visit to Butterworks 
Farm 
in 
Westfield, 
Whalen 
described 
excitedly, ‘‘They showed us their cows and 
their butter compared to store-bought but-
ter. You could literally see the difference in 
color.’’ 
‘‘And texture,’’ Rayfield said. ‘‘You could 
almost feel the love.’’ 
‘‘I’ve gotten a whole community out of it,’’ 
Whalen continued. In addition to the teach-
ers and chef Paul at school, she said, that in-
cludes the farmers. ‘‘It’s a community be-
yond Harwood Union High School.’’ 
The 5-year-old club is just one aspect of 
the district’s well-established farm-to-school 
program. 
Morris, the food and nutrition services co-
director, has been sourcing from local farms 
all 15 years he has worked at Harwood. But, 
while the cafeteria was lauded initially for 
its fresh, locally sourced menu, Morris said 
there was untapped opportunity. ‘‘It was not 
super connected to teachers and staff. It was 
us trying to push it out,’’ he said. 
Enter the Northeast Farm to School Insti-
tute. Six years ago, a team of Harwood 
school and community members started 
meeting 
regularly 
with 
a 
coach 
from 
Vermont FEED to build on efforts in the 
school kitchen. That was what ‘‘kind of got 
the ball rolling,’’ Morris said. 
‘‘The program really started to gain mo-
mentum when students had experience out-
side the cafeteria,’’ he said. ‘‘They didn’t 
want to talk about it; they wanted to do 
things.’’ 
This fall, Harwood students will return to 
a neighboring nonprofit farm, Living Tree 
Alliance in Moretown. There, they have 
moved mulch, planted hazelnuts, made sau-
erkraut and learned how the farmers rotate 
their small flock of sheep to graze different 
paddocks. The farm has sold Harwood cab-
bage and potatoes for use in its cafeteria. 
One Harwood civics and social studies 
teacher used grant money to build a hoop 
house behind the school in which students 
grow salad greens. These, too, become cafe-
teria fare. 
The farm-to-school team came up with a 
local food challenge offered to all home-
rooms: Students tasted something locally 
grown and learned about the concept of food 
miles and the benefits of buying closer to 
home. Farm-to-school club members even 
collaborated with students in a graphic de-
sign course to develop a logo emblazoned 
with a shovel and fork and the words ‘‘com-
munity, cafeteria, classroom.’’ 
Kramer, the club’s faculty adviser, said he 
was pleased when students asked how they 
could build advocacy skills and help others 
access local food. Last year, a group of club 
members partnered with a local gleaning or-
ganization to pick apples at a Randolph or-
chard to donate to area food shelves. Antony 
and a student who has now graduated worked 
with Vermont FEED to testify in front of the 
state legislature. 
‘‘We are very grateful to eat this healthy, 
local food, but not everyone gets to,’’ 
Antony said in the cafeteria. 
‘‘The students are seeing the larger pic-
ture,’’ Kramer said. ‘‘Farm-to-school is a 
great, tangible lens for kids to understand 
things like equity and social justice. They 
are understanding how things are connected 
and using that understanding to find lever-
age points to solve problems.’’ 
Being involved in farm-to-school, Antony 
said, has opened his eyes to the complexity 
of the food system and to his own ability to 
make a difference. 
‘‘It’s all intertwined: nutrition, the edu-
cation system, the legislative system, even 
waste,’’ he said. ‘‘There’s massive change we 
can do in all those spheres. I want to take 
some action.’’

CONGRATULATING THE VERMONT 
LAKE MONSTERS 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
would like to take a moment today to 
recognize the iconic Vermont Lake 
Monsters and their championship vic-
tory in the team’s first season as mem-
bers of the Futures Collegiate Baseball 
League. The Vermont Lake Monsters 
have seen various iterations over the 
years, and the determination, grit, and 
resilience of the team’s players, coach-
es, staff, and fans are clear to all 
Vermonters and fans of the team. 
The Lake Monsters began in 1994 
with establishment of the Vermont 
Expos, a minor league baseball team 
affiliated with the Montreal Expos. 
When the Montreal Expos moved to

Washington, DC, and became the Na-
tionals, the Vermont Expos changed 
their affiliation and their name, be-
coming the Lake Monsters in 2004 and 
affiliated with the Oakland Athletics. 
When Major League Baseball elected to 
shrink the minor league in 2019, the 
Lake Monsters sadly lost their affili-
ation. The loss of affiliation and the 
prospect of the closure of the Lake 
Monsters were devastating for the 
baseball community in Vermont. 
Luckily, the Lake Monsters seized 
the opportunity to join the Futures 
Collegiate Baseball League, bringing 
the team back to Centennial Field in 
Burlington 
after 
a 
2-year 
hiatus. 
Quickly, a new coaching staff was 
hired, and a roster filled. The Lake 
Monsters returned to Centennial Field 
on May 21, beginning a fantastic season 
run that brought them to a champion-
ship title on August 20. 
The Lake Monsters have garnered an 
immense following in Vermont and 
have become a mainstay of our com-
munity. The team, their games, and 
their fans have been an intrinsic aspect 
of the summertime fun for so many 
Vermonters. The resiliency of the Lake 
Monsters and their resounding victory 
in their return to the field, particu-
larly at a time of such turmoil and un-
certainty in our world, brings a wel-
come sense of joy, hope, and levity to 
our community. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
Vermont 
Lake Monsters for their championship 
victory; may your success continue for 
years to come. Vermonters will look 
forward to going to Centennial Field 
for a game next summer to enjoy some 
peanuts, Cracker Jacks, and a Lake 
Monsters win.

REMEMBERING CHRISTOPHER 
CARTWRIGHT 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life of Chris-
topher Cartwright, who passed away in 
May 2021, at age 52. Chris was a dedi-
cated civil servant with a brilliant 
mind, a vast well of patience, and 
boundless compassion. He spent most 
of his 30-year career with the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion and served most recently as the 
Director of NOAA’s Budget Office. 
Chris created an environment of 
trust and collegiality everywhere he 
went. He was unflappable in navigating 
the budget and appropriations process 
and 
always 
applied 
a 
calm 
and 
thoughtful 
approach 
to 
achieving 
NOAA’s mission. Through it all, Chris 
was unfailingly kind and humble. His 
gentle leadership inspired his team and 
those around him to be better people, 
leaders, and public servants. 
Chris was a proud graduate of Syra-
cuse University’s Maxwell School of 
Citizenship and Public Affairs, where 
last year he had the honor of leading 
the graduating class in recitation of 
the Athenian Oath. True to the oath he 
held so dear, Chris ‘‘strived unceas-
ingly to quicken the public sense of 
civic duty.’’ We are grateful for his 
service.

REMEMBERING SUSAN BAYH 
Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I rise 
today in honor of one of the most be-
loved women in Indiana. An attorney, a 
First Lady, a wife, and a mother, 
Susan Bayh will always be remembered 
throughout Indiana for her grace and 
strength. 
Susan Breshears was born in Los An-
geles, CA, in 1959. She received a bach-
elor’s degree from the University of 
California, Berkeley and a juris doc-
torate from the University of Southern 
California. In 1978, she was named Miss 
Southern California. While working on 
Capitol Hill in the early 1980s, she met 
Evan Bayh. The two married in 1985. 
She became Indiana’s First Lady in 
1989, when Evan was elected Governor. 
In 1995, she gave birth to twins Birch 
Evans Bayh IV and Nicholas Bayh, be-
coming the first First Lady to have 
children while in office. 
Susan was a talented attorney. She 
made a name for herself at some of the 
country’s top law firms before joining 
Eli Lilly and Company to manage regu-
latory affairs. Later, she taught at 
Butler University and Indiana Univer-
sity. She passed away in February 2021 
after a battle with brain cancer. 
In Indiana, the Bayh name is famous, 
but as President Biden said, ‘‘Susan 
stood out as a single treasure.’’ As Su-
san’s loved ones and friends gather to 
remember her life at Washington Na-
tional Cathedral this week, Hoosiers 
are grateful for the life she lived, the 
family she raised, and the legacy she 
has left behind.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ROB AND PAM 
STEPHENS 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I would like to honor the lives of 
Rob and Pam Stephens who were inte-
gral members of the Billings commu-
nity. Both Rob and Pam had a passion 
for sharing their love of aviation with 
others. Tragically, on Sunday, Sep-
tember 26th, the Stephens were in-
volved in a fatal plane crash with their 
son Riley. Riley was the only survivor. 
With over 40 years of flying experi-
ence and more than 30 years as a pro-
fessional airline pilot, Rob loved shar-
ing his knowledge and expertise with 
others who aspired to become pilots 
themselves. In 2018, Rob founded Mis-
sion Aviation flight school, located at 
Montana’s Laurel Municipal Airport, 
with the intentions of serving others in 
Yellowstone County who also wanted 
to pursue careers in aviation. 
Most notably, Rob shared his skills 
and passion for flying with his two 
sons, Riley and Steele, both of whom 
have pursued their own careers in avia-
tion and take pride in teaching the 
next generation of prospective pilots. 
Rob and Pam will be dearly missed 
by their children Steele, Riley, and 
Piper, their friends in the aviation 
community, and so many more in the 
Billings area whose lives they touched. 
Piper recently served Montana as an 
intern in my Washington, DC office. As 
Riley continues to receive medical 
care, our prayers are with him and the 
entire Stephens family during this very 
difficult time. May God continue to 
bless and look over them.∑

S. RES. 389 
Whereas the theme for National Alcohol 
and Drug Addiction Recovery Month in 2021 
is ‘‘Recovery is for Everyone: Every Person, 
Every Family, Every Community’’; 
Whereas more than 92,000 individuals in 
the United States suffered a fatal alcohol or 
drug overdose during 2020, an increase of ap-
proximately 30 percent as compared to 2019; 
Whereas during the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, increased isola-
tion and reduced or disrupted access to 
treatment programs have contributed to an 
increase in individuals reporting anxiety and 
depressive disorders when compared to the 
previous year, and 13 percent of Americans 
reported starting or increasing substance 
use; 
Whereas, in 2019, there were approximately 
21,000,000 individuals in the United States 
aged 18 or older in recovery from alcohol and 
drug addiction; 
Whereas the estimated total cost to the 
economy of prescription opioid misuse is 
$78,500,000,000 annually, including the costs 
of healthcare, lost productivity, and involve-
ment of the criminal justice system; 
Whereas individuals with substance use 
disorder may face stigma from health profes-
sionals, as well as friends and family; 
Whereas it has been demonstrated that 
stigma can be a barrier for individuals with 
substance use disorder to accessing treat-
ment and engaging in recovery; and 
Whereas peer-supported communities offer 
individuals with substance use disorder bet-
ter success in recovery by addressing the 
personal and emotional effects of addiction 
and easing reintegration: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of education 
for the prevention of substance use disorder; 
(2) supports efforts to explore the means by 
which integrated care, community, and sense 
of purpose can lead to effective and sustain-
able treatment of substance use disorder; 
and 
(3) shows appreciation and gratitude for 
family members, friends, and other individ-
uals who support individuals in recovery 
from substance use disorder.

Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mrs. 
BLACKBURN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations.: 
S. RES. 390 
Whereas thousands of United States citi-
zens, lawful permanent residents, vulnerable 
Afghans, and their families sought refuge 
following the Afghan Taliban’s takeover of 
the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan; 
Whereas the State of Qatar played a crit-
ical role in assisting the United States in 
evacuating thousands of people from the rule 
of the Afghan Taliban regime; 
Whereas Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar served 
as a central transportation hub for many 
evacuees desperately seeking to exit Afghan-
istan; and 
Whereas Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. 
Austin stated, ‘‘Qatar’s support for Oper-
ation Allies Refuge was indispensable to the 
safe transit of Americans and U.S. personnel, 
allies, partners and Afghans at special 
risk.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) thanks the State of Qatar for their piv-
otal role and support of Operation Allies Ref-
uge; and 
(2) appreciates the State of Qatar’s support 
to temporarily house thousands of evacuees 
until they are cleared for follow-on move-
ment.

SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
391—EX-
PRESSING CONCERN ABOUT THE 
RISE 
IN 
ILLICIT 
MINING 
AND 
TRAFFICKING OF GOLD IN LATIN 
AMERICA AND THE PERVASIVE 
PROBLEM 
THAT 
SUCH 
MINING 
POSES FOR THE SECURITY, STA-
BILITY, AND ENVIRONMENT OF 
THE REGION 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. CARDIN, and Mr. KAINE) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations.: 
S. RES 391 
Whereas during the 10-year period imme-
diately preceding the date of enactment of 
this Resolution, Latin America has wit-
nessed an alarming increase in the illicit 
mining and trafficking of gold and other val-
uable minerals; 
Whereas illicit gold mining is a significant 
challenge across Latin America, specifically 
in the Andean and Amazonian regions, 
where, according to the internationally rec-
ognized nongovernmental organization Glob-
al Initiative against Transnational Orga-
nized Crime— 
(1) Venezuela leads the region with ap-
proximately 90 percent of the gold extracted 
in that country being mined illicitly; 
(2) Colombia and Ecuador closely follow 
with approximately 80 percent of the gold ex-
tracted in those countries being mined illic-
itly; and 
(3) nearly 30 percent of the gold extracted 
in Bolivia and Peru is mined illicitly; 
Whereas illicit gold mining involves the 
extraction of gold in violation of the laws of 
the country in which the activity occurs and 
mostly takes place in remote geographic 
areas with limited government presence, 
leaving 
opportunities 
for 
transnational 
criminal organizations to exploit this prac-
tice to generate billions of dollars in illicit 
profits to bolster their strength and long- 
term viability; 
Whereas the profits derived from illicit 
gold mining have become a leading source of 
the illicit financial activities in the region, 
surpassing the profits generated by coca and 
cocaine production in recent years; 
Whereas transnational criminal organiza-
tions use illicit gold trafficking as a mecha-
nism to launder profits from other illicit ac-
tivities, which frequently threatens the na-
tional security of the United States and un-
dermines legal international trade by com-
promising the lawful gold supply chain and 
exploiting the United States financial sys-
tem for illegal gain; 
Whereas the presence of transnational 
criminal organizations in mining and trading 
chains of gold and other valuable minerals 
profoundly threatens the safety, security, 
and cultural integrity of indigenous commu-
nities across Latin America; 
Whereas illicit gold mining often dev-
astates the environment and is destructive 
to rural and indigenous communities since it 
violates legal standards and safety require-
ments and often involves the illegal use of 
mercury, a potent toxin that, when used im-
properly, contaminates water supplies in the 
areas surrounding illicit mining sites, and 
can result in acute and long-term poisoning 
in people; 
Whereas the recent activities associated 
with illicit gold mining include cutting down 
rainforests and creating pools of stagnant 
water, which contribute to the spread of 
mosquitoes and insect-borne disease, incit-
ing an epidemic of malaria in Venezuela at 
levels not seen in the past 75 years; 
Whereas in May 2016, former President of 
Peru, Ollanta Humala, declared a 60-day 
emergency in the Madre de Dios region near 
Peru’s southeastern border with Brazil in an 
attempt to curb high levels of mercury poi-
soning of residents due to the impacts of il-
licit gold mining; 
Whereas, on February 24, 2016, the authori-
tarian government of Nicola´s Maduro in 
Venezuela enacted a decree that announced a 
new legal framework for open mining under 
the name of ‘‘Orinoco Mining Arc’’ as a 
means to diversify the regime’s cash flow, an 
action done without the approval of the 
democratically elected National Assembly, 
as required by Venezuela’s Constitution; 
Whereas the Orinoco Mining Arc decree 
can impact the mercury content in waters in 
southern Venezuela and devastate the unique 
ecosystems of the Amazon, including World 
Heritage Site Canaima National Park, which 
is the ancestral land of the Pemo´n indige-
nous people and where at least 59 mining 
sites have been detected; 
Whereas corruption and the weak rule of 
law in Venezuela has allowed transnational 
criminal organizations, drug trafficking or-
ganizations, insurgent groups, and other 
armed groups to control and financially ben-
efit from illicit mining operations, many of 
which have exerted control over different 
parts of the Orinoco Mining Arc region and 
beyond, such as Yapacana National Park and 
the Alto Orinoco-Casiquiare Biosphere Re-
serve, home to indigenous communities of 17 
ethnic groups, including the Yanomami and 
Ye’kuana tribes; 
Whereas, according to the Center for Stra-
tegic and International Studies, more than 
500,000 workers are involved in mining oper-
ations in Venezuela, of whom— 
(1) approximately 45 percent are underage; 
and 
(2) the majority are from indigenous com-
munities who were coerced into working 
through threats of violence; 
Whereas the Organization for Economic 
Co-operation and Development, in a Sep-
tember 2021 report, expressed concern that 
the flow of all the gold produced within Ven-
ezuela, which is estimated to total as much 
as 75 tons per year, with a market value of 
more than $4,400,000,000, has a high risk of 
contributing to serious human rights abuses, 
direct or indirect support for non-state 
armed groups, corruption, money laundering, 
and tax evasion; 
Whereas Executive Order 13850, which was 
issued on November 1, 2018, sanctioned indi-
viduals involved in illicit gold operations 
that propped up the illegitimate regime of 
Nicola´s Maduro; 
Whereas the United States signed Memo-
randums of Understanding with the govern-
ments of Peru and Colombia in 2017 and 2018, 
respectively, in an effort to combat illicit 
mining and minimize its negative impacts: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) expresses deep concern about the threat 
that illicit gold mining in Latin America 
poses for the security, stability, and environ-
ment of the region; 
(2) recognizes the threat that illicit gold 
mining in Latin America poses for the na-
tional security of the United States; 
(3) supports the rights of the rural and in-
digenous populations that have been deeply 
affected by illicit gold mining practices in 
the region;

States Government to expand bilateral co-
operation with the governments of Colombia, 
Ecuador, and Peru to combat illicit gold 
mining; 
(5) condemns the Maduro regime for di-
rectly and indirectly facilitating illicit min-
ing of gold and other minerals in Venezuela; 
(6) denounces the Maduro regime’s involve-
ment in illicit mining practices in the Ama-
zonas and Bolı´var states, which have led to 
human rights abuses, destruction of indige-
nous social fabric, deforestation, habitat 
loss, environmental degradation, and a rise 
in cases of malaria and other related diseases 
in Venezuela; 
(7) calls for better regional and inter-

SENATE RESOLUTION 392—RECOG-
NIZING AND SUPPORTING THE

AND 
IDEALS 
OF 
NA-
TIONAL 
FORENSIC 
SCIENCE 
WEEK 
Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mrs. FEIN-
STEIN, Mr. RISCH, and Mr. WARNOCK) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 392 
Whereas the Senate is committed to the 
use of forensic science in the investigation of 
crimes, the prosecution and conviction of the 
correct perpetrators of crimes, and the exon-
eration of innocent individuals falsely ac-
cused of crimes in the United States; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
address critical questions in civil and crimi-
nal investigations and trials in the United 
States, including by providing scientific con-
clusions relating to forensic evidence; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
partner with— 
(1) Federal agencies to build and maintain 
criminal databases relating to latent prints, 
DNA, and other information relevant to 
criminal cases; and 
(2) Federal, State, and local agencies to en-
sure public safety; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
serve a vital role in the criminal justice sys-
tem by providing scientific information to 
investigators and officers of the court; and 
Whereas the fourth week in September 2021 
is recognized as ‘‘National Forensic Science 
Week’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Forensic Science Week; and 
(2) 
recognizes 
that 
National 
Forensic

SPINAL 
CORD 
IN-
JURY AWARENESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself and Ms. 
BALDWIN) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 393 
Whereas approximately 296,000 individuals 
in the United States live with spinal cord in-
juries, which cost society billions of dollars 
in health care costs and lost wages; 
Whereas there are approximately 17,900 
new spinal cord injuries in the United States 
each year; 
Whereas more than 42,000 individuals with 
spinal cord injuries are veterans; 
Whereas motor vehicle accidents are the 
leading cause of spinal cord injuries; 
Whereas nearly half of all spinal cord inju-
ries to individuals 30 years of age or younger 
occur as a result of a motor vehicle accident; 
Whereas the average remaining years of 
life for individuals living with spinal cord in-
juries has not improved significantly since 
the 1980s; 
Whereas there is an urgent need to develop 
new neuroprotection, pharmacological, and 
regeneration treatments to reduce, prevent, 
and reverse paralysis; and

it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates September 2021 as ‘‘National

the United States who are working to im-
prove the quality of life of individuals living 
with spinal cord injuries and their families.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
‘‘RICK’’ COSYNS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Richard ‘‘Rick’’ Cosyns. Rick 
passed away on September 7, 2021 on a 
hunting trip, doing what he loved. Rick was a 
husband, father, son, and friend. 
Rick was the son of Albert and Margaret 
Cosyns. He grew up on a family farm in 
Madera, California where he attended St. 
Joachim’s school and Madera High School. In 
his youth, he was involved in various 4-H 
projects and loved all kinds of physical activity 
including football, and continued to enjoy ski-
ing, competitive shooting, traveling, and hunt-
ing as much as he could throughout his life. 
For college, Rick studied at California State 
University, Fresno where he received a de-
gree in Plant Science. After graduating from 
Fresno State, he became very involved in the 
Plant Science industry and helped run his 
family farm with his brother, Allen. Rick has 
been a general partner in Cosyns Farms since 
1977 and has had involvement in pistachios, 
alfalfa, almonds, and 12 varieties of wine 
grapes. He also operated a honeybee polli-
nation service and consulted on farm manage-
ment services. 
In his spare time, he enjoyed spending time 
with his beloved wife Lynne and many friends. 
He enjoyed the outdoors and spending time in 
the orchards, vineyards and foothill ranch. He 
was the life of the party at any event he at-
tended. Rick and his adored family and friends 
spent much of their time outdoors while camp-
ing, hunting, and fishing, but he also found 
great enjoyment in the small comforts of life 
such as a good glass of wine. 
Not only was Rick a dedicated family man 
and husband for over 30 years, but he was al-
ways committed to the community of the Cen-
tral Valley. He served as a director on the 
Madera Irrigation District, as a member of the 
Madera Planning Commission, as well as var-
ious other community organizations. In addi-
tion to his civil contributions, he also served as 
a supportive parish member of St. Joaquim’s 
Catholic Church in Madera. Annually, Rick 
would help me at the fair, and he always 
made time to help his community. 
Rick is survived by his wife Lynne; son Will; 
daughter Maggie; his sister Linda, and her 
husband Carlos Reynoso; his brother Allen, 
and his wife Susan Cosyns, and his large ex-
tended family. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Richard ‘‘Rick’’ 
Cosyns. His service and contributions to the 
Central Valley and the State of California will 
be missed. I join his family and friends in cele-
brating Rick’s life.

HONORING THE 75TH SEASON OF 
THE 
GENESEE 
SYMPHONY 
OR-
CHESTRA 
HON. CHRIS JACOBS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the Genesee Sym-
phony Orchestra on its 75th consecutive sea-
son. 
One of the oldest civic orchestras in New 
York State, the Genesee Symphony Orchestra 
was founded in 1947 as the Batavia Civic Or-
chestra, with a mission to enrich the local 
community with high-quality performances, 
educational opportunities, and guest artists. 
Under the leadership of its three founders, Mr. 
Norman Hall, Mr. Hugh Lawing, and Dr. Biagio 
Mansuetto, the orchestra performed its first 
concert at the Dipson Theatre in Batavia, New 
York on November 6, 1947. Under the direc-
tion of conductor Jan Wolanek, the concert 
was played to a sell-out crowd of 1,400 peo-
ple. As the orchestra became more popular 
and its influence grew beyond the city of Bata-
via, in 1958 its management changed the or-
chestra’s name to the Genesee Symphony Or-
chestra. 
The Genesee Symphony Orchestra has 
been an important institution within the sur-
rounding community since its founding, includ-
ing in recent years. In addition to its annual 
concerts, the Genesee Symphony Orchestra 
holds an annual ‘‘Young Artists Competition,’’ 
allowing high school students to compete for 
the opportunity to perform with the orchestra. 
The orchestra also holds an annual ‘‘Meet the 
Orchestra’’ event and a ‘‘String Workshop.’’ 
The Genesee Symphony Orchestra is proud 
to have hosted a wide array of talented indi-
viduals during its 75-year history, including fif-
teen renowned conductors and hundreds of 
musicians. The orchestra has welcomed musi-
cal talent ranging from world-class artists and 
composers, to more locally known soloists. 
I thank all musicians, conductors, and mem-
bers of the Board of Directors for their unwav-
ering commitment to bringing arts, culture, and 
entertainment to Western New York, and I 
again congratulate the orchestra on its 75th 
anniversary.

COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNI-

OF 
THE 
PRESCOTT 
CHAPTER OF THE SONS OF THE 
AMERICAN REVOLUTION 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to express my appreciation to the Prescott 
Chapter of the Arizona Society of the Sons of 
the American Revolution and to commemorate 
the chapter’s 25th Anniversary. 
Originally founded in 1997, the Prescott 
Chapter of the Sons of the American Revolu-
tion have consistently honored the memory of 
our forefathers for over two decades. I deeply 
admire the chapter’s unwavering commitment 
to our constitutional republic, our nation’s rich 
history, and our deep-rooted founding prin-
ciples. 
On the 25th Anniversary of the chapter’s 
formation, we have gathered to celebrate and 
recognize the chapter’s civic-minded mission 
and achievements. I commend the previous 
and current members of the Prescott Chapter 
of the Sons of the American Revolution for 
their achievements and continued impact on 
the Prescott community.

HONORING JACK HAMLIN’S 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
wish Jack Hamlin, a lifetime resident of 
Springfield, MO, on his upcoming 100th Birth-
day. 
Born October 15, 1921, Jack has seen his 
fair share of excitement. He was recruited to 
play minor league baseball for the New York 
Yankees when WWII broke out in Europe. As 
many young American men did, Jack enlisted 
in the military. At first attempting to join the 
Naval Air Corps, Jack was disqualified for hav-
ing an enlarged heart, so he joined the Coast 
Guard. His service brought him to Normandy, 
France on June 6, 1944 as part of the D-Day 
invasion. Jack and his unit were tasked with 
rescuing survivors in the water during the in-
vasion. Amid the German counter assault, 
Jack and his unit saved 70 men from the

water and brought them to a hospital ship. 
Jack also took part in the rescue of crew-
members from the SS Leopoldville on Christ-
mas Eve 1944. On June 6, 1944 at Omaha 
Beach, Jack was the only one that shot down 
a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190. For his actions 
that day Jack was awarded the French Legion 
of Honor, their highest medal for Allied troops. 
After the war, Jack returned to Springfield 
and enrolled at the University of Missouri. He 
went on to run a successful insurance busi-
ness in Springfield, and even served one term 
in the Missouri House of Representatives from 
1951 to 1952. He continued to play baseball 
for the Springfield Generals, which led to him 
meeting his wife of nearly 60 years. Through-
out all of this, Jack has always supported and 
served his local community. 
Madam Speaker, Jack Hamlin has lived a 
life of service to his community and his coun-
try, I wish him a happy 100th Birthday, and 
many more to come.

SEPTEMBER VETERAN OF THE 
MONTH 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. HERN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
the First District of Oklahoma’s September 
Veteran of the Month, Michael Coon. 
Michael Coon served our country in the 
United States Army as a paratrooper. Coon 
comes from a family that takes pride in their 
Military service to the United States; both his 
father and his son faithfully served our coun-
try. This family’s heart to help and protect oth-
ers is commendable. Michael Coon continues 
to help and protect members of our veteran 
community. 
Michael goes above and beyond to advo-
cate for his fellow veterans. He is involved 
with Mission 22, a non-profit organization that 
support veterans suffering from PTSD, Trau-
matic Brain Injury, suicide risk, and other chal-
lenges. Michael lost his own son to suicide 
after his service. Michael continues to raise 
awareness of veteran suicide and help others 
struggling. A silhouette of Michael’s son will be 
included in ‘‘The War at Home Memorial’’ cur-
rently being built in Broken Arrow. This memo-
rial will help bring awareness to the 22 vet-
erans that are lost to suicide every day. 
Michael is a veteran, advocate, and a fa-
ther. He answered the call to defend freedom 
and continues to serve others in our commu-
nity. It is my honor to recognize Michael Coon 
as the 1st Congressional District of Okla-
homa’s September Veteran of the Month.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
WILLIAM OTIS FITCH 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. William 
Otis Fitch who passed away on September 
22, 2021. My thoughts and deepest condo-
lences are with his family, friends, and loved 
ones. 
Mr. Fitch was born on August 1, 1933. He 
was raised in Holly Springs, Mississippi and 
graduated from Holly Springs High School in 
1951. Bill was an avid outdoorsman and en-
joyed hunting and riding horses. After grad-
uating high school, he enlisted with the U.S. 
Navy and joined the flight team. With this 
team he made lifelong friendships and consid-
ered it an honor to serve his country. 
After his Naval service, Bill began his career 
in consumer finance and lending. He joined 
City Finance Corporation in Memphis as the 
Vice President. In 1974 Bill and his wife, 
Clydean, opened their own consumer lending 
company, First National Loans. He expanded 
the company throughout Tennessee. He sold 
the company and opened a new chain of con-
sumer finance companies, Fidelity Loan Com-
pany. Over the course of his career he served 
as President and board member of the Mis-
sissippi Consumer Finance Association and 
Memphis Consumer Credit. He was a lifetime 
member of the shriners. 
Preceding him in death are his wife, 
Clydean; mother, Lurline; father, Theodore; 
and brothers Robert, James, and Jerry. Left to 
cherish his memory are his wife, Aleita; 
daughters Lynn and Lisa; six loving grand-
children, and three great-grandsons. 
I am grateful for Mr. Fitch’s service and join 
countless others in mourning his loss.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHN R. 
LAWSON 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of John Robert Lawson. John 
passed away peacefully and surrounded by 
his friends and family on August 24, 2021. 
John was a father, son, grandfather, and 
friend. 
John was the son of Jess and Jane 
(Lawson) Smith. He went to school in Fresno, 
California at Heaton Elementary, St. Joseph 
Military Academy, and Fresno High School. 
He came from humble beginnings and left his 
home at 13 years old. John worked throughout 
school by mowing lawns, delivering news-
papers like the San Francisco Chronicle and 
Los Angeles Times, and worked at a gas sta-
tion 
After high school, John enlisted in the Army, 
and after returning from his discharge, he 
began growing his trucking company known 
as Lawson Rock & Oil. In order to start his 
business, he saved 30 percent of everything 
he made so that he could purchase a truck. 
From there, he was able to grow his company 
and it is now made up of hundreds of trucks 
and employees. His story is the perfect exam-
ple of a self-made businessman and an inspi-
ration to all who hear it. 
As a family man and business owner, John 
never failed to give back to his community. 
John would speak on the importance of a high 
school diploma. He received his 60 years later 
and would tell high school students to always 
take advantage of the opportunities around 
them. His efforts included serving on the Cali-
fornia Transportation Commission, appointed 
by Gov. Gray Davis. He also served on the 
Fresno County Planning Commission. In addi-
tion to these contributions, John helped spon-
sor The Lawson Beneto Classic golf tour-
nament that focused on benefitting children 
with Autism. Along with many other charitable 
community donations, he helped fundraiser for 
Terry’s House at Community Regional Medical 
Center. 
In his free time, John enjoyed racing, riding 
motorcycles, and collecting and restoring hot 
rods. He enjoyed restoring hot rods and re-
storing cars so much, he would share that 
passion with his friends. His love for cars took 
him all over the United States and Canada by 
attending different car shows. He collaborated 
with driver, Billy Boat in the 1990’s and they 
set records for main event victories like the 
1997 Chili Bowl nationals. Throughout this 
time, he had one of the largest collections of 
1932 Fords. 
John was survived by his loving wife Gina 
Lawson; his son JR and wife Suzanne, son 
Jonathan and wife Ashley, son Christopher 
Parrino; and daughter Patty Lawson. He had 
many grandchildren, his sister Terri Rea, and 
husband Scott, and friends missing him. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of John Robert 
Lawson. His service and contributions to the 
Central Valley and the State of California will 
be missed. I join his family and friends in cele-
brating John’s life.

dents can achieve to high levels.

students, teachers, parents, and faculty who 
have been an integral part of securing this fine

compete for government contracts. That is 
why I introduced the Department of Homeland 
Security Mentor-Prote´ge´ Program Act of 2021, 
which authorizes a business mentor-prote´ge´ 
program within the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS). This bill pursues two critical 
goals: strengthening and helping small busi-
nesses, the backbone of our economy, and 
bolstering DHS, which has the critical respon-
sibility to keep Americans safe. The legislation 
will give a hand up to minority-, woman-, and 
veteran-owned small businesses, making them 
more competitive for DHS contracts, and 
therefore, more likely to be successful, offering 
jobs and returning dollars to their commu-
nities. This pandemic has only reinforced the 
significant role that small businesses play. A 
broader, more diverse pool of DHS contractors 
saves taxpayer dollars, creates a stronger 
economy and most critically, helps keep our 
country safe. The Department of Homeland 
Security Mentor-Prote´ge´ Program Act of 2021 
has been included in the House version of the 
FY 2022 National Defense Authorization Act 
(NDAA) as an amendment and I look forward 
to working with my colleagues to ensure that 
this vital piece of legislation remains in the 
final NDAA.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
MAYOR HARVEY C. SKOOG 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the life of Prescott Valley Mayor 
Harvey C. Skoog. Harvey selflessly served his 
community as Prescott Valley Mayor for a total 
of 19 years, excluding the additional years he 
spent serving as a council member and vice 
mayor. Harvey maintained a consistent lead-
ing record in his local community through his 
involvement with the Arizona Society of Prac-
ticing Accountants, Arizona Association of En-
rolled Agents, Good Samaritan Nursing Home, 
Chamber of Commerce, League of Cities and 
Towns, Northern Arizona Council of Govern-
ments, and Central Arizona Senior Associa-
tion, to name a few. Harvey’s accomplish-
ments are widely recognized in the state as he 
was honored as a co-recipient of the 2015 
Prescott Area Leadership Man of the Year 
award. He was also passionate about expand-
ing home ownership, religious freedom, and 
educational opportunities for the youth. 
However, Harvey’s contributions reach fur-
ther than his professional, service, and leader-
ship roles. After marrying Edna in 1960, Har-
vey raised 9 successful children who have 
raised 59 grandchildren and 63 great grand-
children. Madam Speaker, I wish to offer my 
deepest condolences to Harvey’s entire family. 
His contributions will never be forgotten by the 
state of Arizona or the people of Prescott Val-
ley.

Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH. Madam Speaker, I

Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today along with my colleague, Congressman 
MIKE THOMPSON, in celebration of the life of 
Eric Jay Larson, who passed away at the age 
of 56 on August 17, 2021. Eric was a stalwart

estuary. As Environmental Program Manager 
for the State of California Natural Resources 
Agency, Department of Fish and Wildlife, Eric

ridors, marine preserves, coastlines and opens 
spaces. He also worked to acquire wildlife 
green belts and managed fisheries. He was 
nationally recognized by Vice President Al 
Gore for the best managed fishery in the 
United States. This expertise allowed him to 
advise Southeast Asian governments on river 
and wetland restoration efforts. 
Eric was a founding member of the Peace 
in Medicine cannabis dispensary—the first 
non-profit 
and 
permitted 
dispensary 
in

joyment for educating others. His dedication 
and passion has left the region, state and 
world with long lasting benefits and he will be 
sorely missed by his colleagues, friend and 
family. Madam Speaker, we respectfully ask 
that you join us in extending condolences to 
Eric’s family and many friends and in express-
ing our deep appreciation for his decades of

HON. CHRIS JACOBS

Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the State University 
of New York College at Geneseo on its 150th 
anniversary. 
Founded in 1871, SUNY Geneseo is a lib-
eral arts college located in the historic Village 
of Geneseo, New York. SUNY Geneseo has a 
rich history, and I am honored to represent it 
in Congress. 
On September 13, 1871, the Geneseo Nor-
mal and Training School opened its doors with 
71 certificate-seeking students. The following 
year, the first commencement was held with a 
graduating class of ten students. Later re-
named SUNY Geneseo, today the school has 
more than 4,000 students, fifty undergraduate 
degree programs, and twenty-six interdiscipli-
nary minors. SUNY Geneseo has grown expo-
nentially over its 150-year history, while main-
taining its strong commitment to quality edu-
cation. 
Despite the challenges of the past year, 
SUNY Geneseo has continued to deliver a 
high-quality education. This success is dem-
onstrated by SUNY Geneseo’ s designation as 
a ‘‘Top Producer of U.S. Student Fulbright 
Awards,’’ as well as the university’s U.S. News 
and World Report ranking of third for ‘‘Top 
Public Regional Universities’’ in the Northern 
United States. Each of these designations re-
flect the hard work of the students and faculty 
at SUNY Geneseo, who have grown the 
school into an outstanding institution over the 
past 150 years. 
SUNY Geneseo is known not only for its 
academics, but also for its history and tradi-
tions. An iconic feature of Geneseo is the 
Seuss Spruce found in the Sturges Quad. The 
tree’s shape resembles a Dr. Seuss illustra-
tion, likely developing its shape from an ice 
storm. The Sturges Quad also holds the 
‘‘Greek tree,’’ a tree painted by students from 
different Greek organizations during the night. 
This tradition began in the 1960s, yet thou-
sands of layers of paint later, the tree grows 
taller each year. Geneseo is also known for its 
remarkable sunsets, especially those that can 
be seen from the campus Gazebo overlooking 
the Genesee Valley. 
I thank SUNY Geneseo for its commitment 
to preserving and promoting 150 years of edu-
cation, and I again congratulate Geneseo on 
its 150th anniversary.

TRINIDAD ‘‘TRINI’’ GARZA EARLY 
COLLEGE HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. MARC A. VEASEY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor Trini Garza Early Col-
lege High School for becoming a 2021 Na-
tional Blue Ribbon Awardee. 
Trini Garza Early College High School is a 
public school located in the southwest quad-
rant of the Dallas Independent School District, 
the second largest urban school district in 
Texas. The school opened in 2006 and works 
in collaboration with Mountain View College to 
provide a partnership that ensures the goal of 
college success is attained. Garza ECHS stu-
dents attend both high school and on-site col-
lege classes in order to graduate with their 
high school diploma and associate degree. 
Most of the students are the first in their family 
to attend college in an area where about only 
10 percent of the population has a college de-
gree. 
The high school’s namesake is well-known 
Dallas civic leader and businessman, Trinidad 
‘‘Trini’’ Garza. Mr. Garza is known as an advo-
cate for progress for the Hispanic community 
as early as 1969 when he helped organize the 
city’s first Mexican American Leadership Con-
ference. Mr. Garza has also been a strong ad-
vocate and supporter of education. Elected as 
the first Hispanic member of the board of 
trustees in 1969, Mr. Garza was then ap-
pointed Deputy Regional Director of the U.S. 
Department of Education in President Clinton’s 
Administration. Throughout his life, Mr. Garza 
has served his community through involve-
ment in numerous civic organizations. In 2010, 
the Early College High School at Mountain 
View College was named after Mr. Garza. 
Every year, the U.S. Department of Edu-
cation recognizes hundreds of public and pri-
vate schools across the country for their com-
mitment to educational excellence and their 
ability to overcome outstanding odds to prop-
erly educate their students. These schools re-
ceive the National Blue Ribbon of Distinction, 
an award reserved for schools that boast stu-
dents who meet and maintain high educational 
goals. The Blue Ribbon Award celebrates the 
idea that all students, regardless of back-
ground, ability or location, deserve an excel-
lent education. 
The culture of Trini Garza Early College 
High School provides a place where students, 
parents, and faculty become life-long learners. 
There is no punishment for taking risks, no 
systemic anxiety about failure. Students are 
encouraged to advocate for their own learning, 
and teachers tailor student experiences based 
on individualized needs so that all are suc-
cessful in whatever endeavor they choose. 
Trini Garza Early College High School’s 
commitment to excellence has exceeded ex-
pectations on the state accountability systems 
attaining ALL seven distinctions listed in Aca-
demic Achievement: Reading/Language Arts; 
Mathematics; Science; Social Studies; Top 25 
percent Student Progress; Top 25 percent 
Closing Performance Gaps; and Post-sec-
ondary Readiness. The philosophy ‘‘All Chil-
dren Can Learn’’ is ingrained in every aspect 
of this school. It is an honor to celebrate them 
for this historic achievement and their lifelong 
impact on the Dallas community.

PASTOR TOMMY SMITH 
HON. PAT FALLON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. FALLON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Dr. Tommy Smith, the Pastor of the 
First Church of God in Christ in Mt. Pleasant, 
Texas. Pastor Smith has been in ministry at 
the same location for over fifty years. He 
began his ministry as a musician for the 
church before progressing to a Sunday school 
teacher and assistant pastor. Pastor Smith is 
now the District Superintendent of Congrega-
tion in Sulphur Springs, Bonham, Commerce, 
Talco, and Mt. Pleasant areas. He is also the 
Chief Financial Officer of the Texas Northeast 
3rd Jurisdiction of Churches of God in Christ. 
In 2020, Dr. Smith received his Doctor of 
Theology from Newburgh Theological Institute 
after battling with cancer. He also attended 
advanced courses from the Dallas Theological 
Seminary. In addition, Pastor Smith worked for 
the Marketplace Ministries in Mt. Pleasant as 
a chaplain, Titus Regional Medical Center as 
chaplain, and Mt. Pleasant Police Department 
as a ride along chaplain. He continues to set 
excellent examples to others in ministry as a 
Dean of Ordination for newly licensed min-
isters in the Great State of Texas. Pastor 
Smith loves the Lord and will continue this 
ministry until the Lord calls; ‘‘Well done thy 
good and faithful servant.’’ 
I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capitol to recognize 
Pastor Smith’s devotion to God, Country, and 
his congregation. Furthermore, Madam Speak-
er, I extend my personal commendations to 
Pastor Smith for all he has done in service of 
the 4th Congressional District of Texas.

HONORING MRS. SALLY TANNER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with Congressman MIKE THOMPSON to 
honor Mrs. Sally Tanner in celebration of her 
extraordinary life and commitment to serving 
her community. 
Marcella ‘‘Sally’’ Tanner was born in East 
Chicago, Indiana, the youngest of eight chil-
dren born to Anton and Mary Zinski. She 
spent her childhood in Indiana, where she be-
came politically engaged and active in her 
community. It was during this time that she 
planned her first political demonstration. After 
Sally graduated high school, she moved with 
her parents to Southern California, where she 
attended Pasadena Community College and 
the Art Center School of Design in Los Ange-
les. Shortly after finishing school, World War II 
began, and Sally decided to become a riveter 
to serve her country. After the war, Sally had 
her two sons, Christopher and Timothy, and 
began working as an administrative assistant 
for Assemblyman Harvey Johnson. Upon As-
semblyman Johnson’s retirement in 1979, she 
decided to run for his seat in the California 
State Assembly. She won the race and served 
as the Assemblywoman of CA–60 for 14 
years. 
It is evident through Sally’s impactful career 
that she truly touched the lives of all those 
who knew her. Some of her many achieve-
ments in the California Assembly include be-
coming the first Chair for the Clean Air Clean 
Water committee, the Toxic Waste committee, 
and establishing the California Consumers 
Board. She wrote many influential bills, includ-
ing the Lemon Law, which has helped thou-
sands of California consumers of failing vehi-
cles seek retribution. Sally was a fierce advo-
cate for women and marginalized communities

and was a founder of the California Legislative 
Women’s Caucus in 1985. That same year, 
she was appointed to Governor Deukmejian’s 
waste, energy, and technology task force, 
where she was instrumental in composing a 
state waste management plan. Later in her ca-
reer, Sally met Whittier’s Superior Court Judge 
Patricia Hofstetter, who became her life part-
ner. As a testament to her extensive service, 
Sally was named the First Assembly District’s 
Woman of the Year. In addition, she has had 
one park and two streets named in her honor. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that 
Sally Tanner is truly an exemplary civil serv-
ant. Therefore, it is fitting and proper that we 
honor her here today.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RANDY 
PARAGARY 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Randy Paragary. Randy 
passed away surrounded by his loving family 
on August 14, 2021 after a brief battle with 
pancreatic cancer. Randy was a husband, fa-
ther, son, and friend to many. 
After graduating from C.K. McClatchy High 
School, he attended California State Univer-
sity, Sacramento and the McGeorge School of 
Law. Randy received his degree in law, but he 
decided to put his dedication into his career to 
entrepreneurship. The risk paid off. At the 
young age of 23, he opened his first bar called 
the ParaPow Palace in 1969. He started his 
growth with food, nightlife, and restaurants. 
The Paragary Restaurant Group owned and 
operated establishments in Sacramento, Cali-
fornia such as Centro Cocina Mexicana, R15, 
Cafe´ Bernardo, and Paragary’s Midtown. One 
of his recent joys was the Fort Sutter Hotel in 
2020. 
Randy was a family man who dearly loved 
his children Lisa and Sam, but he was also a 
hardworking businessman. He worked along-
side his wonderful wife, Stacy for nearly the 
entire 28 years they were married. His person-
ality was witty yet collected. He never failed to 
make himself and others laugh in social set-
tings. A mentor to many, his leadership, deci-
sion-making skills, and creative mind was ad-
mired by many. A family man, he and his now 
93-year-old mother and daughter would have 
Sunday brunch together every week up until 
his passing. 
His delightful personality was part of what 
made him so successful in life, as he was al-
ways curious about others, and jumped at any 
opportunity to get to know a new guest at his 
restaurant. His business ventures were inspir-
ing to the entire community of Sacramento, 
and he truly left a mark on the restaurant 
scene there. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Randy Paragary. His 
service and contributions to the State of Cali-
fornia will not be forgotten and he will be 
missed. I join his family and friends in cele-
brating Randy’s life. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
ANDREW CARTER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
l rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mr. Andrew Carter who recently celebrated his 
100th birthday. He is a member of the great-
est generation, and I am very proud to have 
men like Mr. Carter representing the state of 
Mississippi. 
Mr. Carter is a native of Tippah county. He 
joined the U.S. Navy on May 17, 1944. He 
loves to tell stories of his time aboard the SS 
Felipe De Nerve, a French liner used to trans-
port troops and supplies during heavy fighting. 
He survived and returned home to Mississippi. 
In December of 1946, Mr. Carter married 
Naomi Street. The couple had six children to-
gether. 
Mr. Carter currently resides in Ripley. He 
enjoys trips to the local coffee shop to spend 
time with his friends, mowing the lawn, and 
exercising. He is a natural storyteller and has 
no shortage of experience. 
I am so thankful for Mr. Carter’s lifetime of 
service to this country and the state of Mis-
sissippi. I wish him many more years of good 
health and happiness.

George 
Kostylov, the Principal of Kiev School No. 155 
for his partnership with Phineas Anderson,

Tucson, Arizona. Mr. Kostylov and Mr. Ander-
son started the first exchange program of sixth 
through twelfth-grade students between Green 
Fields Country Day School and the Kiev 
School No. 155 in 1988. Through this ex-
change program, Mr. Kostylov helped to better 
relationships between the United States and 
the Soviet Union during the presidencies of 
Ronald 
Reagan 
and 
Mikhail 
Gorbachev. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in cele-
brating Mr. Kostylov’s leadership to further 
world peace between our two nations through 
an influential student exchange program.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
INTER-
NATIONAL PLASMA AWARENESS 
WEEK 
HON. DORIS O. MATSUI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of patients across the United States 
and around the world who rely upon medi-
cines made from donated plasma. October 4– 
8 is International Plasma Awareness Week 
(IPAW) and this year, 2021, has seen a con-
tinuation of the urgent need for more plasma 
donations during this difficult pandemic so that 
patients with rare diseases can be assured of 
receiving their treatments. This week, patients, 
plasma donors, and plasma collection centers 
will join together to observe IPAW via a range 
of events seeking to raise global awareness of 
the crucial need for plasma to create life-sav-
ing therapies, recognize that plasma donors 
contribute greatly in saving and improving 
lives, and increase understanding of the many 
rare diseases and plasma protein therapies 
that help to treat them. 
Plasma-derived therapies and recombinant 
blood clotting factors, collectively known as 
plasma protein therapies, are unique, biologic 
medicines that are either infused or injected to 
treat a variety of rare, life-threatening, chronic, 
and genetic diseases including bleeding dis-
orders, hereditary angioedema, immune defi-
ciencies, pulmonary disorders, neurological 
disorders, and infectious diseases such as tet-
anus, hepatitis, and rabies. Nearly 125,000 
people in the U.S. who live with these rare 
diseases, as well as countless others facing 
trauma and emergency medical needs every 
day, rely on plasma protein therapies that are 
only available because of the commitment of 
dedicated plasma donors. 
Plasma protein therapies have significantly 
improved the quality of life, markedly improved 
patient outcomes, and extended the life ex-
pectancy of men, women, and children in 
every community across the country. Healthy, 
committed donors provide the plasma essen-
tial to manufacture these lifesaving therapies, 
and there are now almost 1,000 plasma col-
lection centers in the U.S. that have dem-
onstrated their commitment to plasma donor 
and patient safety and quality by earning Inter-
national Quality Plasma Program (IQPP) cer-
tification. I ask that my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives join me and rise in 
commemoration 
of 
International 
Plasma 
Awareness Week, honoring those committed 
donors and collection centers who make and 
collect needed and lifesaving contributions.

RECOGNIZING GENERAL GARY L. 
THOMAS 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor General Gary L. Thomas, 
United States Marine Corps, for the life of 
service he and his family have performed to 
our great nation. The theme of his distin-
guished career is one of achievement with 
highest honors throughout his 37 years in 
service to the United States of America. 
General Thomas was commissioned as a 
Second Lieutenant in 1984 after graduating 
from the University of Texas-Austin. In his 37 
years as a Marine, General Thomas deployed 
in support of military operations in Bosnia, 
Iraq, and Afghanistan. Notably, his bravery 
and skillful command of Marine Fighter Attack 
Squadron 323 in the opening days of Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom ensured the success of 
follow-on combat operations in the skies and 
on the ground. Additionally, his masterful lead-
ership in combat while in command of Second 
Marine Aircraft Wing (Forward) in Afghanistan 
enabled coalition air forces to effectively pro-
vide fires, transport, and reconnaissance to

ground forces. In various higher headquarters 
staff positions, including his time as the Ma-
rine Corps’ Deputy Commandant for Programs 
and Resources, General Thomas had a lasting 
impact on the Nation’s military readiness, en-
hancing our preparedness to face challenges 
around the globe. We are all safer due to his 
diligence and faithful dedication to duty. 
General Thomas’ final tour in the Marine 
Corps is as the Assistant Commandant of the 
Marine Corps. During a tremendously chal-
lenging period for the Marine Corps, the De-
partment of Defense, and the Nation as a 
whole, General Thomas provided guidance 
and leadership with exceptional skill and drive. 
His broad knowledge base and expertise, his 
ability to foresee the impact of policy changes 
on the current readiness and future health of 
the Marine Corps, and his camaraderie and 
goodwill with senior leadership throughout the 
Department of Defense and U.S. Congress 
proved to be supremely valuable in his role as 
the Service Vice Chief. His sound judgment 
and recommendations reached the highest 
levels of leadership in the Legislative and Ex-
ecutive branches of the U.S. Government. 
General Thomas’ steady leadership during 
these challenging times is just one more ex-
ample of the type of Marine that he is—one of 
our very best. 
Over his years of faithful service, General 
Thomas has earned the Defense Superior 
Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the 
Bronze Star, among other awards. 
General Thomas has served our Nation for 
37 years and will retire on October 15, 2021. 
His extraordinary professionalism has had a 
profound and lasting influence on generations 
of Marines and our entire institution. His lead-
ership and mastery of the art and science of 
the profession of arms are in keeping with the 
highest traditions of the United States Marine 
Corps. I am delighted to have this opportunity 
to recognize not only General Thomas, but his 
entire family for their incredible service to the 
U.S. Marine Corps and our great Nation. Their 
sacrifice and dedication is truly remarkable, 
and a testament to the caliber of patriots our 
country produces. I wish him and his beloved 
wife, Catherine, all the best as they embark on 
a new chapter in their lives. God bless the 
Thomases, God bless the United States of 
America, and Semper Fidelis.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
HASSAN 
JABER’S 
OVER 
40 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
AS 
PRESIDENT 
AND 
CEO OF ACCESS 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 28, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Hassan Jaber on the occa-
sion of his retirement from The Arab Commu-
nity Center for Economic and Social Services 
(ACCESS) after over 40 years of service to 
the organization. His contributions to the Arab 
American community in Michigan and across 
the country are significant and deserve to be 
recognized. 
Mr. Jaber was born in Lebanon and immi-
grated to the United States in 1977. He at-
tended Wayne State University in Detroit, 
Michigan. He worked at ACCESS for several 
years in various roles before ultimately serving 
as CEO and President. Throughout his life-
time, Mr. Jaber has sought to address the 
challenges facing Arab Americans. He has 
done this through collaborating with national 
foundations, think tanks, policy, civil rights, 
and advocacy organizations. A testament to 
his devotion to his heritage despite his busy 
schedule, he still found time to teach Arabic 
Language & Culture to students at the Univer-
sity of Michigan—Dearborn. 
Based in Dearborn, Michigan—the heart of 
the Arab American community in the United 
States—ACCESS is a nonprofit that honors 
Arab American heritage through community- 
building and service. They provide medical, 
public health, mental health, and other support 
services through their Community Health and 
Research Center. ACCESS also aids with em-
ployment 
services, 
citizenship 
preparation 
courses, youth programs, and philanthropy re-
lated to Arab American culture and community 
giving. The programs that they provide help so 
many of our neighbors each day and truly 
change the lives of the people they serve. 
Under Mr. Jaber’s leadership ACCESS has 
grown from simple beginnings as a group of 
volunteers seeking to help the Arab immigrant 
population adapt to American life to a vast 
support system for Arab Americans from all 
walks of life. With Mr. Jaber at the helm, they 
opened the very first Arab American Museum 
in the nation. 
Those who know him know Mr. Jaber’s in-
tegrity, empathy, and his endless quest for eq-
uity and justice. From my days serving on the 
Board at ACCESS I have personally experi-
enced his compassion and wisdom and know 
how much he cares for the people of his com-
munity. He is a proud American, someone 
who is patriotic and is unafraid to show it. In 
his next role he will be as a consultant for AC-
CESS, focusing on national policy and advo-
cacy and cultivating the next generation of 
Arab American leaders. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Hassan Jaber for four decades 
of service with ACCESS. His outstanding com-
mitment to the Arab American community here 
in Dearborn and beyond has made all the dif-
ference. I join with Hassan’s family, friends, 
and colleagues in extending my best wishes to 
him in his next role. His positive impact will be 
felt for years to come and we are beyond 
grateful for his leadership.
