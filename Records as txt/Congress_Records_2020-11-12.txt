House of Representatives

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of the universe, we give You 
thanks for giving us another day. 
In the days following our national 
elections, we give You thanks that we 
live in a nation that has a system that 
allows for a change or readjustment of 
government peacefully, yet mindful 
that there are many who continue to 
obstruct that important transition. 
Bless with courage those of both par-
ties who know the importance of mov-
ing forward once the people have spo-
ken. In a world besieged by so many 
life-changing forces, from weather to 
disease to community disruption, call 
forth leaders of distinction in these dif-
ficult times. 
Bless the Members of this assembly 
as they begin to return, and in the days 
to come. Please give them the wisdom 
they need and the charity they must 
possess to work together. Help them to 
make wise decisions in a good manner, 
and to carry their responsibilities 
steadily with high hopes for a better 
future for all our great Nation. Deepen 
their faith, widen their sympathies, 
heighten their aspirations, and give 
them the strength to do what ought to 
be done for this country. 
May Your blessing, O God, be with 
them and with us all this day and every 
day to come, and may all we do be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2020 
No. 193 
Senate 
The Senate met at 11 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Master, we honor You for 
Your glory and strength. Your glory 
fills us with reverence, and Your 
strength inspires us with courage. 
Bless our lawmakers. Inspire them to 
find fulfillment in the splendor of holi-
ness. Lord, remind them that You ex-
pect people of faith to illuminate the 
darkness of this world with exemplary 
actions that prompt people to glorify 
You. May our Senators remember that 
their 
conduct, 
particularly 
during 
times of adversity, has long-term con-
sequences. 
Lord, we praise You that You con-
tinue to rule our universe. 
We pray in Your awesome Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
31ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
VELVET REVOLUTION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Iowa 
is home to a lot of people who have a 
heritage from the Czech Republic and 
the Slovak Republic. November 17 is 
coming up pretty soon, and it marks 
the 31st anniversary of the Velvet Rev-
olution in Czechoslovakia. 
In 1989, the Czech people stood up 
against Communist rule and, through 
nonviolent 
demonstrations, 
precip-
itated the nation’s transition to de-
mocracy. The Velvet Revolution lasted 
43 days and in the end ended 41 years of 
Communist control of Czechoslovakia. 
Jingling keys became a symbol of the 
revolution and of the new doors that 
democracy and freedom from com-
munism would unlock for those great 
people in Czechoslovakia. 
Now we have two countries—the 
Czech Republic and the Slovak Repub-
lic. We also have a National Czech and 
Slovak Museum in Cedar Rapids, IA. 
This museum helps to educate Ameri-
cans about these events I just talked 
about and, most importantly, to teach 
them about the importance of never 
giving up on fighting for freedom. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, last 
week, the country and the world re-
ceived some really great news that we 
have longed for quite a while to hear. A 
major American drug company, to-
gether with its German partner, an-
nounced that their candidate for a 
COVID–19 vaccine appears to be at 
least 90 percent effective in trials. That 
is 90 percent—nine zero. Dr. Fauci 
called these preliminary results ex-
traordinary. Another expert called the 
news ‘‘as good as you could hope for.’’ 
Of course, tests and trials are ongo-
ing. The FDA will perform its own 
thorough review, which will include 
analyzing months of safety data. The 
American people should rest assured 
there are appropriate and necessary 
measures to ensure the safety and effi-
cacy of any vaccine before it is rolled 
out to the American people, but this 
will proceed with the lifesaving ur-
gency that is called for. 
Right now, COVID–19 is continuing to 
spread across the country at rates that 
are not sustainable and which we must 
try to slow. Yesterday, my home State 
of Kentucky just logged its highest 
ever daily total—2,700 new cases. The 
positivity rate of our tests is the high-
est since early May. 
It is urgent that all Americans con-
tinue the smart steps that have gotten 
us this far: wearing masks, social 
distancing, adapting our plans and rou-
tines. This virus is not going to magi-
cally leave us alone if we decide we are 
fed up with taking precautions, but 
thank God and thanks to the brilliant 
scientists, we may look back on this 
hopeful announcement as the begin-
ning of the end of this terrible ordeal. 
I said back in March that our coun-
try was about to meet a whole lot of 
brandnew heroes. Many were going to 
be doctors and nurses. Others were 
going to be essential workers who kept 
society going. Some were going to be 
the men and women who worked like 
crazy in labs and research centers until 
we had this virus beaten. But every 
single American has a role. 
As cases continue to climb, the sim-
ple advice—wear a mask, practice so-
cial distancing, wash your hands—is 
now just as important as ever. So, of 
course, discovering the vaccine will 
only be a part of the battle. Once one 
or more candidates have been proven 
effective and safe, it will be a second 
Herculean undertaking to scale up pro-
duction and distribute doses of the vac-
cine throughout our country. This is 
why this Senate and the Trump admin-
istration have been on the case for 
months. 
As part of the historic CARES Act, 
we created Operation Warp Speed—a 
historic effort that combined inter-
agency government work with public-

private partnerships. This was a 21st- 
century 
Manhattan 
Project 
for 
a 
COVID vaccine. We helped fund re-
search and development for several 
firms. We committed billions of dollars 
in advance purchase agreements. We 
flattened regulatory barriers to speed 
the process. We provided backing so 
that companies could begin mass-pro-
ducing vaccine doses before clinical 
trials had fully concluded so we would 
have a head start on whichever ones 
wound up working. 
If things stay on track, we hope to 
have a safe and effective vaccine in a 
timeframe that will be absolutely his-
toric. President Trump’s administra-
tion and this Congress should take 
huge pride in the groundwork we laid. 
Now, strangely enough, some are 
finding it challenging to simply ap-
plaud this unambiguous good news. 
The Democratic Governor of New York 
opined a few days ago that it was ‘‘bad 
news’’ that a vaccine breakthrough 
may have been reached, because Presi-
dent Trump is still in office. 
Now, I understand Governor Cuomo 
has found the time during this pan-
demic to write and publish a self-con-
gratulatory book on leadership—this, 
notwithstanding that his own State 
has been absolutely pummeled by the 
disease and his own administration in-
tentionally sent thousands of COVID– 
19 positive patients into vulnerable 
nursing homes. 
The Governor has the temerity to say 
this vaccine breakthrough is partially 
‘‘bad news’’—partially ‘‘bad news’’?— 
because it occurred under the Trump 
administration. He gestured vaguely 
toward unspecified concerns about dis-
tribution. I guess he would have pre-
ferred the lifesaving breakthroughs to 
have been delayed longer, with more 
American deaths in the meantime. 
The irony, as our colleague the Sen-
ator from Tennessee has pointed out, is 
that the plans that are in place put 
States in the driver’s seat for arrang-
ing distribution and making sure the 
most vulnerable citizens receive ac-
cess. The Federal Government is there 
to provide guidance and support. As 
Senator ALEXANDER said, the Governor 
of New York might want to devote 
more time and attention to developing 
this crucial plan rather than under-
mining public confidence for the sake 
of politics. 
Sadly, this isn’t anything new. Just a 
few weeks ago, the Democratic Gov-
ernors of both New York and California 
both began openly second-guessing the 
Food and Drug Administration and 
doubting its ability to assess the safety 
of a vaccine. There were suggestions 
that blue States may set up their own 
State review boards and then withhold 
lifesaving vaccines from their own peo-
ple for who knows how long until this 
extra obstacle had been hurdled. This 
is where they are. Vaccines aren’t vac-
cines if a Republican is President until 
New York and California reinvent their 
own miniature FDAs. 
To be clear, Americans purchase 
nearly 4 billion prescriptions every sin-
gle year—4 billion prescriptions—trust-
ing the expertise and professionalism 
of the FDA. That is the trusted author-
ity. Nobody is crying out for liberal 
Governors to add their own Good 
Housekeeping seal of approval, let 
alone potentially delaying the end of 
COVID–19 to do so. 
If this vaccine proves to be the one, 
citizens in New York and California 
should not have it withheld from them 
because their Governors care more 
about performatively opposing Presi-
dent Trump than about hard science. 
This reminds me of when the junior 
Senator from California declared back 
in September, during her Vice Presi-
dential campaign, that she might hesi-
tate to trust a vaccine. 
The whole country understands that 
our Democratic friends are not charter 
members of the Donald Trump fan 
club. We know that. They do not need 
to dabble in the early stages of anti- 
vax conspiracy theories to prove it. In 
fact, for the sake of public health and 
public confidence and saving lives, 
they have a moral obligation to stop. 
If a vaccine has been found and dis-
tribution can begin soon, that is good 
news, not bad news. It would be a 
major victory for our country and the 
world, fueled by American innovation 
and aided by Operation Warp Speed, 
thanks to this Senate and the Trump 
administration. It would save thou-
sands and thousands of American lives, 
and public confidence will be essential. 
So this is where we are. Leaders on 
all sides have a duty to act accord-
ingly.

2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
yesterday, we came together as a coun-
try—not as Republicans, not as Demo-
crats or Independents, but as Ameri-
cans—to recognize the service and sac-
rifice of our veterans, men and women 
who served in uniform to protect our 
country and to defend our democracy. 
The ongoing attacks that President 
Trump has launched on our democracy 
are an insult to those who have sac-
rificed so much to defend, and so too is 
the complicity of so many Republican 
Senators right here in this body, who 
through their silence or active incite-
ment are spreading Donald Trump’s ab-
surd false narrative that he won the 
election. 
Each of us—each of us in this body— 
has sworn an oath to protect and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States, to stand up for our democracy, 
and to support the peaceful transfer of 
power established there. My colleagues, 
it is time for every Senator to do your 
sworn duty and stand up for the Con-
stitution and for our democracy. 
Make no mistake, on January 20, Joe 
Biden will be sworn in as the next 
President of the United States and 
KAMALA HARRIS will be sworn in as the 
next Vice President of the United 
States. But that does not mean that 
what Donald Trump is doing now is 
harmless. That does not mean that the 
silence or active complicity of so many 
Republican Senators is harmless. It is 
downright dangerous to the health of 
our democracy and to our national se-
curity interests. 
We have enough challenges pro-
tecting our democracy from foreign en-
emies and foreign adversaries who seek 
every day to undermine faith and con-
fidence in democratic institutions here 
in the United States and in other de-
mocracies around the world. The last 
thing we need is for people to attack 
that confidence from within the United 
States. This is doing harm in the short 
term and the long term to our national 
security, putting us at risk. 
In the short term, we are seeing a 
very dangerous purge of top national 
security officials at the Defense De-
partment and other places. These are 
officials with whom I have many policy 
differences, but they are competent 
managers and qualified individuals. 
And what you are seeing this President 
do in the death throes of his adminis-
tration is purging those qualified indi-
viduals and replacing them with people 
whose only credential is loyalty to 
President Trump, and replacing com-
petent, qualified individuals with polit-
ical lackeys. That is dangerous at any 
time. It is especially dangerous to mess 
around with the top leadership of our 
national security agencies during a 
transition to power. 
That is what the 9/11 Commission 
told us. Yet what you are seeing Presi-
dent Trump do is play with matches 
when it comes to our national security

November 12, 2020 
and to put personal political peeves 
above the national security interests of 
the United States. 
In addition to purging individuals 
from some of our top national security 
agencies, the President is prohibiting 
the government of the United States, 
which belongs to the people of the 
United States, from providing daily in-
telligence briefings and other intel-
ligence briefings to the incoming Presi-
dent, President-Elect Joe Biden. 
Now, we all know that President 
Trump has been notorious for not being 
interested in those intelligence brief-
ings, but I think that for all of us who 
know Joe Biden from the time he 
served as Senator and Vice President, 
we know he takes these things seri-
ously and he takes threats that might 
be learned through those intelligence 
briefings seriously. To deny the next 
President of the United States access 
to those briefings, which is part of the 
tradition and part of the rules that we 
developed to ensure steady transfer and 
making sure the next President has the 
information needed on day one, that is 
outright grossly negligent when it 
comes to our national security. It is 
time for our Senate Republican col-
leagues to be speaking out loudly 
about that. 
That, of course, is part of the con-
sequence of the fact that the General 
Services Administration has been un-
willing to provide the traditional funds 
to support the peaceful transfer of 
power. This is another gross abuse of 
the government, which belongs to the 
people of the United States, not to 
Donald Trump. 
In addition, you have the Secretary 
of State, Secretary Pompeo, instruct-
ing the Department of State not to 
pass along messages from foreign lead-
ers to the next President of the United 
States, President-Elect Joe Biden. This 
is, again, another gross abuse of power. 
And, of course, Secretary Pompeo un-
dermined this faith in our transition of 
democracy himself when he talked 
about 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
are 
transitioning to the second Trump 
term. 
This is the person—this is the indi-
vidual—who is supposed to represent 
the United States of America overseas, 
the person who is supposed to stand up 
for our democracy, and yet, here, at 
home he is undermining faith in that 
democracy. And who does that give any 
comfort to? Our adversaries and en-
emies abroad, people who want our de-
mocracy to fail. 
I don’t know if our Republican col-
leagues have noticed who has congratu-
lated the President-Elect Joe Biden 
and who has not among foreign leaders. 
Well, our democratic allies around the 
world have congratulated the next 
President of the United States, Joe 
Biden. The United Kingdom, France, 
Germany, 
Canada—the 
leaders 
of 
democratic governments and countries 
have all acknowledged that our democ-
racy is working and that they are rec-
ognizing the next President of the 
United States. 
Who has refused, so far, to congratu-
late the next President of the United 
States, Joe Biden? Vladimir Putin, 
President Xi, and the leader of North 
Korea. What President Trump is doing 
and what our Republican colleagues 
are doing by their silence is aiding and 
abetting these authoritarian leaders. 
These guys are smiling. If you are an 
authoritarian leader, you want nothing 
more than to see democracy fail—to 
see that model fail. These are leaders 
who often have their own sort of elec-
tion facades, where they pretend to 
have a free and fair election, and then 
it turns out to be 90 percent for them. 
They are smiling at what is happening 
here. 
So I hope our Republican Senate col-
leagues are looking at the company 
they are keeping among foreign leaders 
who are watching us, because the lead-
ers of our democratic friends and allied 
countries have all recognized the out-
come of this election, and it is the 
leaders of Russia, China, North Korea, 
and others who have not. That is the 
company that is being kept by so many 
Republican Senators today. And that is 
going to do ongoing damage to our 
ability around the world, as the world’s 
oldest democracy, to stand up for the 
interests of liberty, freedom, and de-
mocracy. 
I fear that that is not even the most 
damaging thing that has happened as a 
result of this fraud that is being per-
petrated on the American people. The 
biggest danger is undermining the con-
fidence of the American people them-
selves, or large numbers of the Amer-
ican people, in the outcome of this 
election, seeding this false narrative 
that somehow Donald Trump was actu-
ally the winner and that Joe Biden was 
somehow an illegitimate President-to- 
be. 
If you look at the recent polling in 
the last 48 hours, what you find is that 
70 percent of Republicans believe this 
was not a clear and fair election. That 
is two times as many as before the 
election, and that is when Donald 
Trump was telling everybody that, if 
he lost, it meant the election was 
rigged. 
Are we really, through our silence or 
sometimes encouragement, going to 
seed the idea that because Donald 
Trump lost the election it was rigged? 
All you have to look at is the frivolous 
claims being made in courts around the 
United States and the reaction to those 
claims by judges, appointed by Demo-
crats and Republicans alike, to realize 
what a charade this is. 
Joe Biden, as a candidate, has said he 
wants to bring the country together. 
He and KAMALA HARRIS want to find a 
way to bring us together to find com-
mon ground. And he is looking for the 
opportunity to work on both sides of 
the aisle here in the U.S. Senate and in 
the House of Representatives to ad-
dress urgent matters before our coun-
try. 
So I ask my Republican Senate col-
leagues: How are you going to take the 
extended hand of Joe Biden when you 
are telling so many of your constitu-
ents back at home that this is an ille-
gitimate election? How are you going 
to do that? 
What we have seen in the aftermath 
of this election is scary because we saw 
so many times over the last 4 years 
that our Republican Senate colleagues 
refused to stand up to the abuse of 
power of this administration, things 
that if the Obama administration ever 
thought of doing, they would be out 
there every day crying foul and abuse 
of power. But everybody enabled that 
conduct. And now, after the election, 
when Joe Biden was already 5 million 
votes ahead in the national vote and 
winning the electoral college, you 
would think this is a moment for ev-
erybody to come together to give the 
next President of the United States a 
chance. 
I think the scary thing of what this 
shows is that the Republican Party has 
become the party of Donald Trump. I 
just urge my colleagues to think about 
the consequences of feeding into this 
fraud that Donald Trump was actually 
the one who was elected, because what 
you will be saying there to the 72 mil-
lion Americans who voted for Donald 
Trump is that he is, in fact, the right-
ful President, and he will therefore also 
continue to call the shots within the 
Republican Party. He is doing that 
now, even after he has lost an election. 
So I just urge my colleagues to think 
about what they are doing each day 
that goes by that reinforces this false 
and fraudulent claim—how it is harm-
ing our democracy, how it is harming 
our national security, how it is going 
to impede Joe Biden’s ability to reach 
out to our Republican colleagues. It is 
not because he doesn’t want to—he 
does—but because you will have under-
mined your ability to do it by telling 
tens and millions of Americans that 
somehow this was an illegitimate elec-
tion. 
I ask, I implore my colleagues to 
think more about this as every hour 
goes by, because every hour that this 
lie continues and persists is another 
hour that you are harming the health 
of our democracy and our country. 
Thank you. 
I yield back.

IMPACT AID CORONAVIRUS 
RELIEF ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this sum-
mer, Senator SMITH and I introduced 
the Impact Aid Coronavirus Relief Act. 
If enacted, this bill would provide 
much needed relief to school districts

gram. And given the many other

strains they are feeling due to the on-
going pandemic, it can’t come soon 
enough. 
By way of background, public school 
districts 
on 
military 
installations, 
Tribal land, and other Federal public 
property, or with students living on 
these Federal properties, can partici-
pate in the Impact Aid Program, which 
includes nearly 40 school districts in 
the State of South Dakota. 
This program is of vital importance 
to the financial well-being of these 
schools, as it reimburses them for rev-
enue shortfalls due to the reduction or 
absence of a local tax base because of 
the presence of Federal property. 
In order to determine grant awards 
through this program, school districts 
must annually calculate the number of 
federally connected students that they 
have enrolled. While generally a pru-
dent exercise, during a pandemic, con-
ducting this type of count has pre-
sented a new set of challenges for ad-
ministrators. 
The Impact Aid Coronavirus Relief 
Act is a commonsense, bipartisan ap-
proach that would not cost a dime yet 
would provide financial stability to 
school districts by allowing them to 
use last year’s student headcounts on 
impact aid applications that they are 
completing this fall. Doing so would 
prevent the reporting of noticeable, but 
likely temporary, declines in student 
enrollment, which would lead to stu-
dent reduced impact aid payments next 
year. 
Distance learning has made col-
lecting student data more challenging 
as well. Districts are also experiencing 
declines in student headcount due to 
parents 
choosing 
to 
temporarily 
homeschool their children during the 
pandemic. 
Unless Congress allows these school 
districts to use last year’s student 
headcounts on this year’s impact aid 
applications, schools will have the 
undue burden of collecting this data 
during an otherwise challenging time 
and could very well experience a re-
duced impact aid payment next fall. 
Our legislation will ensure that they 
have certainty in the near term. 
A companion of our bill passed the 
House by unanimous consent on Octo-
ber 2, and impact aid school districts 
are eager for the Senate to do the 
same. I hope we can get that done 
today. 
I yield to the Senator from Min-
nesota for some comments. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise in 
support 
of 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
THUNE’s request to pass the Impact Aid 
Coronavirus Relief Act, H.R. 8472, by 
unanimous consent. 
As we continue to respond to the 
coronavirus pandemic, we need to sup-
port schools so that students can keep 
learning. In Congress, we have a special 
obligation 
to 
federally 
impacted 
schools. 
As 
my 
colleague 
Senator 
THUNE has said, these are schools that 
are located in districts with a signifi-
cant amount of nontaxable land, which 
puts them at a significant disadvan-
tage for raising education revenue. And 
we make this right by providing direct 
Federal payments which are crucial for 
their operation. 
What this bill does—what our bill 
does—is to provide a commonsense 
change. It allows school districts to use 
student counts from the previous aca-
demic year when they submit their im-
pact aid applications. In light of the 
challenges of doing a safe and active 
count in the midst of this coronavirus 
pandemic, this only makes sense. 
I thank my colleague from North Da-
kota, Senator THUNE. I have been so 
glad to work with him to support 
school districts that rely on Impact 
Aid Programs and to promote financial 
stability for these school districts dur-
ing the pandemic. 
I hope we can pass this bill today and 
get it signed into law. 
I yield. 
Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator 
from Minnesota. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the immediate con-
sideration of H.R. 8472, which was re-
ceived from the House.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 8472) to provide that, due to 
the disruptions caused by COVID–19, applica-
tions for impact aid funding for fiscal year 
2022 may use certain data submitted in the 
fiscal year 2021 application. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding? 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 8472) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time,

APPROPRIATIONS 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am 
pleased to be here today to talk about 
the 2021 appropriations bill that we 
filed this week for Labor, for Health 
and Human Services, and for Edu-
cation. 
Obviously, with what we have gone 
through this year, those three agencies 
have all experienced dramatic chal-
lenges—labor challenges, health chal-
lenges, 
education 
challenges. 
And 
while this bill would not specifically be 
a COVID relief bill, it is a bill that 
funds these agencies so they can move 
forward with their normal work rather 
than have to, in some piecemeal way, 
try to deal with their normal work 
while they are trying to work with us 
on the extraordinary circumstances of 
the COVID bill. 
This 
is 
the 
largest 
bill—Labor, 
Health, and Education is the largest 
nondefense bill on the discretionary 
side of the agenda. It is about 30 per-
cent of all the money left when the De-
fense appropriations is taken off the 
table. 
There are 11 bills left at that point, 
but this bill has about 30 percent of all 
the money. It has a lot of competing 
priorities, from apprenticeships to bio-
medical research, to public health and 
preparedness programs, to childcare 
and special education. National service 
and community service are all in this 
bill. 
We received 8,352 requests from Sen-
ators of things they would like to see 
in the bill. They are not all in there, 
but we did all we could to take the 
money we had and move forward with 
priorities that make sense. 
I am disappointed at this point that 
our Democratic colleagues on the Ap-
propriations Committee were unable to 
support the bill right now, but we have 
worked together in the past. I hope we 
can continue to work together to find a 
way forward. And, frankly, my view is 
if appropriations bills appear to have a 
path to the President’s desk, that is 
the thing that brings us together most 
quickly. 
This bill continues in our sixth year 
of commitment to robustly and con-
sistently funding medical research at 
the National Institutes of Health. We 
provided a $2 billion increase on that 
research. We target funding toward 
Alzheimer’s, toward precision medi-
cine, premature birth research, the 
BRAIN Initiative. In my time as chair-
man, we have actually increased NIH 
funding by 45 percent in budgets that 
often had virtually no increase at all. 
We truly had to work together to 
prioritize. We have done that. 
My time as chairman is about 6 
years, if you are wondering how long it 
took us to get that 45-percent increase. 
Six years ago, we hadn’t had any in-
crease for 12 years. NIH was about 22 
percent behind in buying power where 
they had been a decade earlier. We 
made up that 22 percent. And actually, 
now, we are putting real money on the 
table in an environment that has never 
been better and never been more prom-
ising in the NIH research area. 
We continue our focus of combating 
opioids. Between 1999 and 2018, nearly 
450,000 people in the United States died 
from opioid overdose. These drug over-
dose deaths in 2018 were four times 
higher than in 1999. The bill provides 
money to deal with this. With the ef-
fort we made in this area over the last 
several years, we saw a consistent de-
crease in opioid overdoses until 2020. 
Of course, the increase in 2020, in 
many ways, related to the pandemic 
and the isolation. The support struc-
ture that appeared to be working to 
move you from dependency was no 
longer there, and suddenly you are 
back where you were. 
The bill provides a $20 million in-
crease for apprenticeship programs. 
This week, I joined the Missouri Cham-
ber of Commerce in highlighting the 
importance of apprenticeships. Last 
year, Missouri was the second in the 
Nation in the number of new appren-
ticeships. First in the Nation is Cali-
fornia. We are not a small State, but 
we are not nearly as big as California, 
so I think the leadership in our State— 
the business community, the employ-
ers, the Governor, and others—has 
made a real difference there. We fund 
both registered apprenticeship pro-
grams, and it allows for industry-rec-
ognized programs as well. 
Fourth, the bill invests in education, 
from early childhood through college 
and career. It increases funding for 
high-quality early childcare and edu-
cation by more than $150 million. It in-
creases funding for elementary and sec-
ondary education programs that pro-
vide the most flexibility to school dis-
tricts to decide how to best use those 
limited resources. This also includes 
increased investments in title I; in 
IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act; the title IV student 
support 
and 
academic 
enrichment 
grants; charter schools; and Impact 
Aid. It increases the maximum Pell 
grant award by another $150, or a 2.4- 
percent increase, at a time when the 
mandatory money is gone. To find that 
2.4-percent increase, we have to find it 
in other programs, and some programs 
are just not able to fund it. If they are 
not working, we shouldn’t fund them, 
and we have seen several years of 
growth in areas in which we have a pri-
ority like Pell grants. To do that, we 
had to look carefully at programs that 
just, frankly, were not working. 
Fifth, we continue our focus on clos-
ing the care gap between mental health 
and physical health. Approximately 
one in five adults in America has a 
diagnosable and almost always treat-
able mental health problem. This bill 
provides an increase of almost $200 mil-
lion in the mental health area. 
I would mention again the excellence 
of the mental health pilot. We have in-
creased that pilot to eight States from 
two. We are seeing what happens in a 
positive way in people’s other health 
issues when you deal with their mental 
health issues like it was any health 
issue, and it is making a difference. 
This year, it was reinforced again by 
understanding the need to address dis-
parities in foster care, a greater diver-
sity in healthcare, education, and the 
workforce. 
Many populations across the coun-
try, whether defined by race, ethnicity, 
geography, experience higher rates of 
certain diseases and often lack the ac-
cess to health services. This bill tries 
to look at that in a way that analyzes 
where those gaps are, and it has pro-
grams that encourage filling those 
gaps. Furthermore, the bill continues 
our efforts to ensure that these dispari-
ties are addressed through a number of 
programs, including workforce develop-
ment programs, diverse medical com-
munity efforts, research initiatives 
that focus on underserved commu-
nities, programs that target health dis-
parities, and education-workforce pro-
grams that create opportunity. 
This bill prioritizes programs that 
provide the most benefit and greatest 
return for all Americans. The bill con-
tinues key program integrity activities 
that are aimed at reducing the waste, 
fraud, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. 
These initiatives have proven to be a 
worthwhile investment in their return-
ing billions of dollars to the Treasury 
and allowing us to look in other places 
as to how we could fund that money in 
programs that work better and work 
more transparently. 
This bill eliminates eight programs 
equaling nearly $115 million in spend-
ing reductions by focusing on programs 
that are the most efficient and cost-ef-
fective and with proven outcomes. We 
all know that budgets are tight, but 
making careful choices about health 
spending can be one of the most valu-
able investments we make in Congress. 
You don’t have to look any further 
than the recent announcements about 
the record progress we have made in 
finding 
a 
vaccine 
for 
COVID–19. 
Through the CARES Act and other leg-
islation, Congress provided $18 billion 
for research into therapeutics and vac-
cines, and $12.5 billion went to vac-
cines. It did it in a way that is going to 
allow us to set a record in having a safe 
vaccine available that meets the high-
est standards. The vaccine that appears 
to be the first in line for approval is 90 
percent effective.

November 12, 2020 
Now, I am not an expert in vaccines, 
so my first thought would be, well, I 
want a vaccine that is 100 percent ef-
fective. As it turns out, no vaccine is 
100 percent effective. The measles vac-
cine that schoolkids took for years and 
that most still take is 90 percent effec-
tive. 
It 
was 
9 
months 
ago 
that 
healthcare experts said, if we could 
have a vaccine that was 50 percent ef-
fective, we should approve that vaccine 
and every other one that was at least 
50 percent effective. 
We are looking at vaccines that are 
going to help us move beyond this as 
we look at tests that help us move be-
yond this, but the fundamental founda-
tion of all of that is in the healthcare 
framework that we maintain. You 
can’t look at a pandemic and say that 
now it is time to think about how we 
do important health research. You 
can’t look at a pandemic and say that 
now it is time to think about having 
care providers in underserved areas. 
You can’t look at a pandemic and say 
that now it is time to begin to think 
about how you connect childcare and 
work and school altogether. This bill 
does as much of that as we could figure 
out how to do in the best way we could 
figure out how to do it. 
I hope Congress can pass it. It would 
be a great gift to the next Congress and 
administration after January 20 to be 
able to start next year with next year’s 
work rather than having to start next 
year with this year’s work. Let’s get 
this year’s work done. Let’s get it done 
now. Let’s send the bill to the Presi-
dent that the House and Senate have 
agreed on, and let’s get back to looking 
at these bills in the right way at the 
right time. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

VETERANS DAY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, when most Americans think of 
the sacrifices that our veterans made 
in the name of defending freedom, they 
think of those brave men and women 
running toward the danger. We are 
grateful that, in their hearts, they 
have that desire, but as anyone who 
knows or has worked with veterans 
knows, they also make sacrifices that 
really never bubble to the surface or 
come to our attention. Not only do 
they sacrifice their own safety, they 
give up their personal independence, 
the comforts of home, their relation-
ships with friends and family, their 
spouses, and their children. 
Think about what an extraordinary 
decision they have made—that the 
safety and security of their fellow 
countrymen is worth more than losing 
those precious days. They have made 
that choice. They put that service and 
that sacrifice in front of their desires, 
in front of the desires of their family. 
They are, indeed, called to serve. 
These are the people whom we should 
be looking to for comfort and inspira-
tion during difficult times. They really 
do have experience in that category. 
They have made those sacrifices, and 
they have made those choices knowing 
that it wouldn’t be easy and knowing 
that they may not come home, but, 
when they do come home, that some-
times it is tough. It is tough to get 
back in that groove of where you were, 
to rekindle those relationships. 
Our younger veterans, in particular, 
were painfully aware of this when they 
put on the uniform. But do you know 
what? They still made that choice to 
serve. 
Here in the Senate, we have backed 
legislation that really has made things 
easier for so many of our veterans. 
When I was in the House, I was hon-
ored to help shepherd passage of the 
VA MISSION Act, and I was grateful to 
see that receive bipartisan support 
here in the Senate. It has, indeed, 
streamlined many of the processes in 
the VA healthcare system. 
Last month, I introduced a bill to 
provide doula services to improve ma-
ternal health outcomes for our female 
veterans, a population that every sin-
gle month continues to increase. 
Back in August, I introduced a bill 
that will allow our K2 veterans to ob-
tain the special health screenings they 
need to check for cancer and other ill-
nesses caused by exposure to toxic sub-
stances in Uzbekistan. 
In fact, this has been a great year for 
veteran support. We have passed—or 
are very close to passing—legislation 
that will improve and simplify doctor- 
patient relationships, recordkeeping, 
and mental health services, and will 
make those and other important bene-
fits more accessible to our veterans 
and their families. 
If you are not already supporting 
these efforts, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
As the week draws to a close, I would 
encourage everyone to seek out vet-
erans’ stories and to internalize the 
knowledge that the sacrifices they 
made were for us. There is so much we 
can learn from those who have served. 
There is so much that they have done 
to help preserve our way of life and our 
freedoms. It is so much that they have 
done for the values and the institu-
tions—things that really do transcend 
politics. 
I reached out to many of our vet-
erans this week and had great con-
versations and heard from veterans on-
line. 
I heard from William, a Tennessean 
who proudly served in the Air Force. 
He said his service was ‘‘the best deci-
sion of his entire life.’’ 
I also heard from Greg, who served as 
a C–130 crew chief in theatre during 
Desert Storm. He put off his college 
education when he was asked to serve. 
And I would be remiss if I did not rec-
ognize the veterans who are currently 
serving in our office: Dana Magneson, 
John Clement, Jay Strobino, Dr. Karen 
Summar, and Paris Cervantes. 
I thank each and every one of them 
for their service and for the continued 
work that they do on behalf of all Ten-
nesseans. 
These brave men and women rep-
resent the hope of a nation and our 
promise to the rest of the world that, 
no matter what, the United States 
stands ready and willing to answer the 
call. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SASSE). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I have 
come to the floor again today to talk 
about the need for us, as a Congress, to 
come 
together 
to 
address 
this 
coronavirus pandemic. We have an un-
precedented healthcare and economic 
crisis right now, and it is important for 
us to figure out what we can do, what 
we can agree on, and then move for-
ward. 
Since this pandemic began back in 
March, I am told I have come to the 
floor now 17 separate times to urge my 
colleagues to work together on a bipar-
tisan basis to try to put together legis-
lation that will enable us to respond ef-
fectively and in a focused way to the 
COVID–19 crisis. 
We had some early successes. Re-
member the CARES Act that was 
passed back in March. That was 8 
months ago—8 months ago. Really, for 
the last 6 months, we haven’t passed 
anything to address this crisis. Yet the 
crisis has ebbed and flowed, and, right 
now, unfortunately, it is at an all-time 
high in my State of Ohio. 
I have been frustrated that we can’t 
have that same sense of urgency and 
willingness to work together as we had 
during those first couple of months of 
the coronavirus pandemic. It seemed to 
have disappeared as we entered elec-
tion season; didn’t it? So, as we got 
closer and closer to the election, there 
was more and more divide and inability 
to come together. Now we need to get 
back to that sense of bipartisanship—I 
would even say nonpartisanship in so 
much of this—and cooperation for the 
good of our country. 
It is getting worse, as I said, in my 
State of Ohio and around the country, 
and I believe we can make a difference, 
and that is important. There are things 
we can do at the Federal level that 
would help. 
Right now, we are averaging in this 
country over 100,000 new cases per day. 
That is double the rate from just 1 
month ago—double the rate from 1 
month ago. It was predicted as it got 
colder and people were inside more. 
The third wave has arrived. 
In Ohio, the number of daily new 
cases has risen every day for the past 
month. Just last night, Ohio Governor 
Mike DeWine reported nearly 6,000 new 
cases in the last 24-hour period, com-
pared to 1,000 cases per day that the

State experienced just at the beginning 
of October. 
Unfortunately, it is not just about 
new cases. We are seeing increases in 
hospitalizations. We are seeing in-
creases in patients that are in the ICU 
units. We are seeing increases, sadly, in 
fatalities. We need to do more to help 
this economy, too, because the econ-
omy, as the pandemic has worsened, 
has begun to slow. 
Initially, we had impressive eco-
nomic growth—no question about it— 
but it has begun to slow at a time when 
the economy is still down 10 million 
jobs since February. Think about that. 
We are still 10 million jobs short from 
where we were in February. What we 
really don’t want is for those 10 million 
people to become long-term unem-
ployed, who may never reenter the 
workforce. That is why it is important 
to act and act now. 
Unemployment claims, which were 
going down, by the way, seem to have 
more or less flattened in most States, 
including Ohio. Ohio’s unemployment 
rate, we are told, for the most recent 
month we have data for, which is Sep-
tember, was still above 8 percent. I 
think it is better now, but it is still 
way too high. 
And, of course, certain sectors of the 
economy, like hospitality, travel, and 
entertainment, are really struggling 
badly, with no end in sight, as some 
States begin to reimplement these 
stricter social distancing measures, 
and some States are even putting back 
in place closures. So, if you are in the 
hospitality 
business, 
entertainment 
business, or travel business, you are 
concerned right now. To counter the 
spread of the virus, these closures are 
also going to have a terrible economic 
impact on businesses and on families. 
These dangerous trends are putting 
people’s lives and livelihoods at risk if 
we can’t start to reverse them. And, 
again, it has been 6 months since we 
came together in any kind of a package 
and 8 months since the CARES pack-
age. 
I believe there are some in Congress, 
including, I believe, the Speaker of the 
House, who were not interested in see-
ing a comprehensive package passed 
before the election. They thought it 
would be good politics, I guess, for 
President Trump. I don’t know. Look-
ing at the results of the election, I 
think it might have been just the oppo-
site. 
But the point is that the election is 
now behind us. So if that was the rea-
son, let’s forget that. Let’s get some-
thing done here. Let’s get this partisan 
gridlock off the docket on this issue, 
and let’s focus on what is good for the 
American people. This is what is called 
the lameduck session of Congress. So 
that is a good time to do it. We are 
past the election, and the new Congress 
hasn’t come on yet. Let’s work to-
gether in good faith toward a Federal 
response that is focused and targeted, 
and we can find some common ground 
here. 
I believe the best path forward is 
very close to what has been embodied 
in some of these more targeted pro-
posals, including ones that we have put 
on the floor repeatedly here since way 
back in August. These bills are inclu-
sive of some of the most important bi-
partisan priorities, like providing need-
ed funding for vaccine and therapy de-
velopment and like replenishing the 
successful PPP program for small busi-
nesses. It was included in the CARES 
Act, by the way, but it expired back in 
August. So, on August 9, the Paycheck 
Protection Program, or PPP, actually 
expired. So for these struggling small 
businesses, they have nowhere to turn. 
How about providing funding to the 
schools? That is bipartisan. How about 
making sure that we have folks who 
are able to come together to help en-
sure that we have adequate funding for 
this exciting new vaccine development 
that we are hearing about? Anyway, 
when we have tried to bring these to 
the floor, the other side has blocked 
even entering into a debate about it. 
Instead, Democrats have insisted on 
the House-passed Heroes Act, which 
passed in May, with almost no Repub-
lican support, which makes a bunch of 
controversial changes to policy unre-
lated to coronavirus—repealing State 
and local tax deductions to benefit 
mostly wealthy Americans and making 
unprecedented changes to immigration 
laws. What do these policies have to do 
with coronavirus? Nothing. 
At a time of unprecedented deficits 
and debt, it makes those changes with 
a pricetag of $3.5 trillion. And some 
say: Well, the Speaker is now down to 
$2.4 trillion. Folks, whatever that num-
ber is, it is going to be unprecedented. 
We never had anything that expensive 
pass the Congress. It is at a time, 
again, when we have the highest deficit 
we have ever had. And our debt, as a 
percent of our GDP, sadly, is now 100 
percent of our GDP, which it hasn’t 
been since World War II. 
We are past the contentious election 
season now. So let’s put aside the poli-
tics and let’s build a targeted, bipar-
tisan coronavirus bill based on what we 
all agree works and what we agree real-
ly is needed in the face of a rapidly 
spreading virus. 
Here are a few examples of what we 
can do. First, our next coronavirus re-
sponse 
package 
should 
have 
the 
Healthy Workplace Tax Credit, which 
basically says: We all want people to 
get back to work, back to school, and 
back to the hospitals. But let’s do it 
safely. This would really help the bars, 
the restaurants, the salons, the gyms, 
the bowling alleys, and other busi-
nesses to reopen safely and stay open 
by basically compensating them for the 
purchase of hand sanitizers, PPE like 
face shields and gloves, and for the re-
configuration of their workplaces with 
plexiglass, as we are seeing, and for 
other measures to allow for social 
distancing. 
As businesses prepare to winterize 
their outdoor spaces in order to pre-
vent the spread of COVID, this payroll 
tax credit that is in this legislation 
would help offset those costs and help 
businesses stay open. It is just what we 
need to help keep our economy afloat. 
This is, I think, the sweet spot. I 
think everyone agrees, I hope, that we 
should go back to work, go back to 
school, go back to the hospitals, and so 
on, but we need to do it safely. That is 
what this does. Shouldn’t that be bi-
partisan? Even nonpartisan? 
Second, we should invest heavily in 
testing and contact tracing so that 
States are better equipped to respond 
to the surge of outbreaks. Republicans 
and Democrats alike know that fast 
and accurate tests are critical to stop-
ping the spread of this disease and get-
ting people more comfortable going 
back to shopping, going back to work, 
going back to school, and going back to 
a more normal life. 
The targeted bill, again, that we in-
troduced last month that Democrats 
blocked had $16 billion set aside for 
testing and tracing. We could use those 
resources right now in Ohio. I spoke to 
Governor DeWine earlier this week. We 
want the money for testing. We need it. 
Let’s pass it now. 
Third, we also need help to continue 
the development of these treatments 
and these vaccines as quickly as pos-
sible. The recent news of a potential 
vaccine by Pfizer with a 90-percent effi-
cacy is really promising, but we can’t 
take our foot off the gas on this. If we 
cannot 
address 
the 
underlying 
healthcare 
challenge 
with 
the 
coronavirus, we are going to be stuck 
playing defense against this disease for 
a long time. 
The targeted bill from last month in-
cluded $37 billion for vaccine develop-
ment and distribution and $20 billion 
for therapies, which I think are really 
good starting points for us to at least 
debate what the final number should 
be. But let’s help right now to ensure 
we don’t slow down the vaccines and 
the therapies and be sure the distribu-
tion works. 
In the face of a virus that seems like 
it is getting more and more out of hand 
every day, these three proposals are ex-
amples—the tax credit for safely re-
opening businesses, money for im-
proved testing and tracing, and money 
for vaccine and therapy development. 
These all seem like commonsense 
ideas. I don’t see any reason why a ma-
jority in this Chamber can’t come to-
gether and build a bipartisan response 
based on these kind of simple policies. 
Whatever we do, we can’t afford to 
delay any longer. American lives are at 
stake, and we are in danger of losing 
ground where we gained it on the 
coronavirus, as this third wave threat-
ens my home State of Ohio and our 
country. Let’s not wait any longer. 
Let’s come together and once again get 
something done that helps the people 
whom we represent.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER

HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Penn-
sylvania.

November 12, 2020 
ROSIE 
THE 
RIVETER 
CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL ACT OF 
2019 
Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I rise 
today to urge this body to pass H.R. 
1773, the Rosie the Riveter Congres-
sional Gold Medal Act. This bill would 
honor the American women who joined 
the workforce in support of the war ef-
fort during World War II. 
Millions of women dedicated them-
selves to strengthening our Nation and 
answered the call to action by joining 
the workforce and learning new jobs. 
Many of these women built the vehi-
cles, the weaponry, and the ammuni-
tion that were critical to the war ef-
fort. Whether they worked on assembly 
lines, addressed the troops’ medical 
needs, or tended to ships and farms, 
Rosies ensured the country continued 
functioning during the war while often 
serving as the primary caretakers for 
their children. 
These Rosie the Riveters rose to the 
challenge and set a powerful example 
both to working women and for all 
Americans. Rosies not only faced gen-
der-based discrimination, but Rosies of 
color fought racial discrimination, all 
while 
manufacturing 
planes, 
ships, 
tanks, weapons, jeeps, and everything 
else that was needed to defeat the 
enemy in World War II. 
Today, their example continues to in-
spire generations to embody the ‘‘We 
can do it’’ spirit. The Rosies are among 
our Nation’s greatest living heroines. 
They deserve recognition and formal 
commendation for their service to our 
country while they are still with us. 
The Rosies who are still alive are in 
their nineties, and we need to honor 
them now. The House version of the 
Rosie the Riveter Gold Medal Act 
passed a year ago on November 13, 2019, 
by unanimous consent and with broad 
bipartisan cosponsorship. The Senate 
version, S. 892, which I introduced last 
year, has 76 cosponsors, including 36 
Republicans, as well as all 26 women 
serving in the Senate of both parties. 
This body has already made clear its 
overwhelming support for the bill. 
Each State contributed to the war ef-
fort, and each State has Rosies await-
ing this award. 
I would like to tell you about a Rosie 
the Riveter from my home State of 
Pennsylvania. I will just put up a post-
er of a picture of her. As I said, she is 
a Pennsylvanian. Her name is Mae 
Krier of Levittown, PA, Bucks County, 
Southeastern 
Pennsylvania. 
Mae 
worked in a Boeing factory where she 
helped make B–17 and B–29 warplanes 
as a teenager during World War II. Mae 
is now 94 years old and has been work-
ing to recognize and honor her fellow 
Rosies—not for years; she has been 
working on this for decades. 
Mae is a patriot. And Mae is now 
serving her country yet again during 
another crisis. She has spent the better 
part of this year making face masks for 
those who need them. These polka-dot 
masks are reminiscent of the bandanna 
worn by the woman in the famous ‘‘We 
Can Do It’’ poster. 
Mae is the embodiment of the ‘‘We 
Can Do It’’ spirit. For over 70 years, 
from the Boeing assembly line where 
she worked to her sewing machine 
today, Mae has devoted herself to the 
betterment of the Nation. 
She and her fellow Rosies have 
earned this Congressional Gold Medal. 
Many of Mae’s friends—her fellow 
Rosies—have passed away without the 
recognition that they are worthy of. 
Thousands more are eagerly awaiting 
the passage of this bill, in addition to 
the families of the Rosies who have 
died. 
This honor has already been delayed 
for far too long. I urge my colleagues 
to pass this important, time-sensitive 
legislation. 
So, Madam President, as if in legisla-
tive session, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Committee on Banking, Hous-
ing, and Urban Affairs be discharged, 
and the Senate proceed to the imme-
diate consideration of H.R. 1773. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 1773) to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal, collectively, to the women in 
the United States who joined the workforce 
during World War II, providing the aircraft, 
vehicles, weaponry, ammunition and other 
material to win the war, that were referred 
to as ‘‘Rosie the Riveter’’, in recognition of 
their contributions to the United States and 
the inspiration they have provided to ensu-
ing generations. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to proceeding? 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent 
that the bill be considered read a third 
time and passed and that the motion to 
reconsider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 1773) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
Mr. CASEY. Thank you. 
f 
NOMINATION OF AILEEN 
MERCEDES CANNON 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise today to support the con-
firmation of Aileen Mercedes Cannon 
to serve as a U.S. District Court Judge 
for the Southern District of Florida. 
Ms. Cannon has a distinguished record 
of public service, during which she has 
demonstrated a firm commitment to 
upholding the United States Constitu-
tion and respecting the rule of law. She 
began her legal career as a law clerk 
for Judge Steven Colloton on the 
Eighth Circuit United States Court of 
Appeals and has served with the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office for the Southern Dis-
trict of Florida since 2013. I am con-
fident that she will continue to serve 
the Southern District of Florida well 
once she is confirmed to the bench, and 
I am proud to support her confirmation 
today. 
Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

objection, it is so ordered.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
world is celebrating major develop-
ments in the global race for a vaccine. 
All year, since this pandemic hit, our 
greatest scientific minds have been 
working around the clock to develop a 
vaccine that will finally bring the pan-
demic and the crisis associated with it 
to an end. Researchers are testing doz-
ens of vaccines in the hope of finding at 
least one that can stop the spread of 
the virus, which has claimed more than 
1.2 million lives worldwide and nearly 
240,000 here in the United States alone. 
Early data from Pfizer’s vaccine trial 
gives us a lot of reasons to be hopeful 
when the company announced on Mon-
day that its vaccine was more than 90 
percent effective in preventing the dis-
ease. For reference, standard flu vac-
cines for the seasonal flu are typically 
40 to 60 percent effective, so 90 percent 
is a big deal. This breakthrough is a 
testament to the ingenuity and the 
near-universal commitment to trying 
to find a vaccine that will eliminate 
the threat of this pandemic, and it is a 
sign of hope for all people around the 
world. 
Later this month, once Pfizer has 
collected the recommended 2 months of 
safety data, the company plans to re-
quest emergency authorization for the 
vaccine from the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration. By the end of the year, it 
will have manufactured enough doses 
to immunize 15 to 20 million people. 
Congress has made tremendous invest-
ments in the development of thera-
peutics and of vaccines through the 
CARES Act, and I am incredibly proud 
of the men and women who have led 
this fight on the frontlines, including 
in my State of Texas. 
During preclinical trials over the 
summer, scientists at the Texas Bio-
medical Research Institute in San An-
tonio tested the Pfizer vaccine on mon-
keys, with impressive 
results. 
Dr. 
Deepak Kaushal, who oversaw the 
study, said they saw a 100-percent pro-
tection rate in the monkeys that were 
given the Pfizer vaccine. 
Once it was ready for human trials, 
hundreds of Texans volunteered to be 
vaccinated. Nearly 200 patients from 
Austin have participated in the study. 
The 
University 
of 
Texas 
Medical 
Branch at Galveston has enrolled more 
than 500 participants at its three sites 
in Galveston, League City, and Clear

Lake City, and hundreds more in the 
Dallas-Forth Worth area have volun-
teered to be part of the trial. 
One of those Texans is a woman 
named Andrea Lucia, who received her 
first dose of the vaccine from a clinic 
in Keller, TX, in late September and 
returned for the second dose 3 weeks 
later. Like other volunteers in a dou-
ble-blind study, where half gets a pla-
cebo and the other half gets the vac-
cine, Andrea doesn’t know if she re-
ceived the vaccine or not, but every 
week, she is asked if she has any symp-
toms. Andrea said she will have occa-
sional followup appointments over the 
next year and a half, and once the vac-
cine becomes publicly available, she 
will find out if she received it already 
through the clinical trials. 
I thank Andrea and the thousands of 
men and women like her who have vol-
unteered to test these vaccines in the 
ongoing clinical trials. They have 
risked their own health to ensure the 
world can access a safe and effective 
vaccine as quickly as possible and, of 
course, subject to the determination by 
the Food and Drug Administration 
that it is safe and effective. 
Of course, none of this would be pos-
sible without the brilliant researchers, 
scientists, doctors, and nurses who 
sprinted at full speed in the race for 
this vaccine for months on end. Amer-
ica is proud of their heroic work, and 
we will keep cheering them on and sup-
porting their work as the race for a 
vaccine continues. 
END-OF-YEAR PRIORITIES 
Madam President, finally, while the 
election updates have dominated head-
lines over the last week or so, the work 
of the 116th Congress is far from being 
finished. 
As I mentioned yesterday, my top 
priority is to pass another coronavirus 
relief package. We need to ensure that 
our researchers and scientists have the 
resources they need to continue to 
make progress on the therapeutics and 
eventual vaccine and the money and 
the logistical organization needed to 
deploy the vaccine once it is finally ap-
proved. I suspect that there will not 
just be one vaccine but, hopefully, mul-
tiple vaccines available. 
We also need to make sure that our 
ongoing 
economic 
recovery 
keeps 
trending in the right direction. 
While 
addressing 
this 
pandemic 
should be our top priority, we can’t 
take our eyes off of other threats. Over 
the last few months, I have been work-
ing with a bipartisan group of Senators 
and others in the House to advance leg-
islation to address our vulnerabilities 
in one of our most critical supply 
chains. This is one of the most signifi-
cant lessons this virus has taught us— 
the vulnerability of some critical sup-
ply chains. One of those is for semi-
conductors. 
Regardless of how much the average 
consumer knows about semiconduc-
tors, these chips, these integrated cir-
cuits, are everywhere. They are in the 
technology for everything, including 
our cell phones to the advanced weap-
ons systems that support our national 
security and defense. Yet, for all of the 
ways our dependence on products that 
use semiconductors has grown, so has 
our vulnerability, because the U.S. pro-
duction of these chips has declined over 
the last two decades. It will come as no 
surprise that other countries have 
stepped in to fill the void. 
China has gone from manufacturing 
zero semiconductors to manufacturing 
16 percent of the world’s supply. You 
can bet it doesn’t plan to stop there. 
China is preparing to invest another 
$1.4 trillion in semiconductor tech-
nologies. If you are looking for a rea-
son that this is so dangerous, just look 
at the personal protective equipment 
shortages we faced at the start of this 
pandemic. The need was so high that 
hospitals asked the public to help boost 
their supplies. They took donations 
from folks who had extra boxes of N95 
masks in their garages, and they took 
gloves from salons that had closed 
their doors to help in the mitigation ef-
forts. 
We didn’t reach that point because of 
there being a lack of preparation by 
hospitals but, rather, because of our re-
liance—our dependence, if you will—on 
other countries, notably China, to 
produce this medical gear. It has been 
a wake-up call and a reminder that we 
need to take action today to protect 
our most critical supply chains from 
similar vulnerabilities. If we are going 
to regain lost ground in semiconductor 
manufacturing, it is going to require a 
strategic investment by the Federal 
Government. 
That is where the legislation I intro-
duced with our colleague, the senior 
Senator from Virginia, Senator WAR-
NER, comes in, which is called the 
CHIPS for America Act. It creates a 
Federal incentive program, through 
the Department of Commerce, to en-
courage semiconductor manufacturing 
in the United States. This will, we 
hope, help to stimulate domestic ad-
vanced semiconductor manufacturing 
and boost both our national security 
and our global economic competitive-
ness. 
We worked hand in glove with Sen-
ator COTTON from Arkansas and with 
Senator 
SCHUMER, 
the 
Democratic 
leader, in drafting an amendment that 
was adopted by the whole Senate by a 
vote of 96 to 4 in the national defense 
authorization bill. So, as you can see, 
this is a priority for both the Repub-
licans and the Democrats in the House 
and in the Senate, and I am optimistic 
that it will head to the President’s 
desk with the full National Defense Au-
thorization Act in the coming weeks. 
Yet this just means we are halfway 
there. 
The next step is funding. I am work-
ing with colleagues on both sides to en-
sure we can provide the full funding for 
this legislation and finally restore 
American leadership in semiconductor 
manufacturing. This is key to our long- 
term national security and economic 
competitiveness, and it will be one of 
my top priorities in the coming weeks 
as the Senate prepares to consider ap-
propriations bills. 
It is no longer possible for us just to 
leave this sort of laissez-faire free mar-
ket economics. Our competitors—nota-
bly, Communist China—are investing 
billions of dollars in everything from 
5G to artificial intelligence, to quan-
tum computers. They don’t have to go 
through a democratic or constitutional 
process like we do in order to appro-
priate money for that purpose. 
I just think it is time for us to 
rethink and maybe reset the way we 
view our vulnerabilities and our need 
to be competitive and, indeed, to win 
that competition with countries like 
Communist China, which do not play 
by the same set of rules as we do. 
Before the end of the year, I also 
hope we can get another piece of legis-
lation across the finish line called the 
Jenna Quinn Law, which is the ulti-
mate example of noncontroversial, con-
sensus legislation. Senator HASSAN of 
New Hampshire is my partner on this 
particular bill. It is named for an in-
spiring Texan who is one of more than 
42 million adult survivors of child sex-
ual abuse nationwide. Sadly, these vic-
tims often stay silent for months, 
years, or some for even a lifetime, and 
as a result, they and countless other 
victims continue to be subjected to 
abuse. 
Jenna has devoted her life to inter-
rupting this cycle. She was the driving 
force behind a State law in Texas 
which requires training for teachers 
and caregivers and other adults who 
work with children on how to prevent, 
recognize, and report child sexual 
abuse. The signs of child sexual abuse 
are unique from other forms of child 
abuse, and correctly identifying these 
signs is integral to bringing children 
out of an abusive situation. 
After our State law passed in 2009, 
one study found educators reported 
child sexual abuse at a rate almost four 
times greater after training than they 
did before training. It was one of the 
first child sexual abuse prevention laws 
in the United States to mandate such 
training, and now more than half of the 
States have adopted some form of 
Jenna’s Law. 
Well, you might ask, if the States are 
passing these laws, why would we need 
to pass one here at the Federal level? 
Many States that have required train-
ing simply don’t have funding for these 
programs. The Jenna Quinn law, when 
we pass it out of the House and it is 
signed by the President, will change 
that. It will allow the Department of 
Health and Human Services to make 
grants to be used for specialized train-
ing for students, teachers, and care-
givers to learn how to identify, safely 
report, and hopefully prevent future 
child 
sexual 
abuse. 
It 
encourages 
States without similar laws to imple-
ment innovative programs to address 
child sexual abuse.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6668 
November 12, 2020 
The Jenna Quinn Law passed the 
Senate 
unanimously 
here 
in 
Sep-
tember, and common sense would lead 
you to think it would pass in the House 
quickly and land on the President’s 
desk without delay. Unfortunately, 
common sense doesn’t always prevail 
here in Washington. Some in the House 
have chosen to hold this lifesaving leg-
islation in an effort to advance a par-
tisan bill that has no chance of passing 
in the Senate. 
That is what many people hate about 
this place—holding hostage a con-
sensus, bipartisan, child sexual assault 
victim prevention bill to help advance 
another partisan bill that has no 
chance of passing. We all know that an 
all-or-nothing approach here in Wash-
ington and particularly in Congress 
leaves you in the end with nothing. 
And when it comes to something as 
grave and consequential as child sexual 
abuse, that should not be an option. 
As I have said before, this is a bipar-
tisan bill that received unanimous sup-
port here in the Senate. 
I have worked with several House 
Democrats on this legislation, includ-
ing Congresswoman SUSAN WILD, who 
is the lead sponsor, and Congress-
woman HALEY STEVENS, both of whom 
are members of the committee that has 
so far not even taken up the bill in the 
House. I have also been joined by two 
fellow Texans—Congressmen MICHAEL 
MCCAUL and RON WRIGHT—who have 
seen the incredible impact Jenna’s Law 
has had in our State. 
I hope our Democratic colleagues 
will push back on their leaders who are 
basically dragging their feet on this 
legislation and get it passed so we can 
save lives. 
As families have isolated at home 
during the pandemic, signs of abuse 
have been harder and harder to iden-
tify. Teachers, education professionals, 
and other support staff at schools, like 
busdrivers, are responsible for more 
than half of the child sexual abuse re-
ports, but obviously, if our children 
aren’t going to the classroom, those re-
ports are declining. 
With children at home during the 
pandemic—out of sight from their 
teachers and other adults who would 
otherwise see them on a routine basis— 
we have seen a 40-percent decrease in 
reports compared to the same time last 
year. Well, normally, that would be 
great news. Any reduction in reports of 
child sexual abuse would be great news. 
But based on everything we know 
about the stresses and circumstances 
created by this pandemic and the fact 
that the children have to be in school 
to get identified as being a victim, this 
reduction in reports is distressing for 
all the obvious reasons. It is just not 
being identified or reported like it 
should be. 
The need to pass this legislation to 
help our most vulnerable escape the 
cycle of abuse has never been greater. 
So I would urge all of our colleagues 
and particularly our House colleagues 
to pass the Jenna Quinn Law without 
delay so we can get it to the Presi-
dent’s desk so we can provide the help 
victims of child sexual abuse need as 
soon as possible.

ator from Virginia. 
2020 ELECTIONS 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, on No-
vember 9, 2016, I had one of the most 
memorable experiences of my life. 
I stood on a hotel stage in New York 
City and, as my party’s nominee for 
Vice President, introduced Secretary 
Hillary Clinton to address her sup-
porters and the Nation for a concession 
speech. The polls in the Western United 
States had just been closed for about 10 
hours, and it was a mere 8 hours after 
news organizations had called the 2016 
election for Donald Trump. 
Hillary Clinton had made history. 
She was the first woman nominee of a 
major party for President, and she had 
won the popular vote by millions of 
votes. 
She was also deeply concerned about 
the election itself. Candidate Donald 
Trump had openly solicited help from a 
foreign adversary to win the election. 
While the dimensions of the foreign 
misinformation campaign were not yet 
fully clear, the Nation’s intelligence 
community had publicly warned that a 
foreign country was active in efforts to 
undermine Secretary Clinton’s can-
didacy and create chaos and division in 
the American electorate. 
But Hillary Clinton was and is a pa-
triotic American. She knew that she 
was behind by nearly 77,000 votes in the 
key States of Pennsylvania, Michigan, 
and Wisconsin. She knew that it was 
highly unlikely that recounts would 
change any of those three deficits in 
any appreciable way. 
I watched Secretary Clinton struggle 
with the war between her personal feel-
ings and her earnest search for what 
was right for the country, and I strug-
gled with those same feelings. I was 
proud of Secretary Clinton when she 
walked to a microphone and said these 
words: 
Last night, I congratulated Donald Trump 
and offered to work with him on behalf of 
our country. I hope that he will be a success-
ful president for all Americans. This is not 
the outcome we wanted or we worked so hard 
for and I’m sorry that we did not win the 
election for the values we share and the vi-
sion we hold for our country. 
We have seen that our nation is more deep-
ly divided than we thought. But I still be-
lieve in America and I always will. And if 
you do, then we must accept this result and 
then look to the future. Donald Trump is 
going to be our next president. We owe him 
an open mind and the chance to lead. 
Our constitutional democracy enshrines 
the peaceful transfer of power and we don’t 
just respect that, we cherish it. 
It takes a strong moral compass to 
quickly set aside personal disappoint-
ment and choose country over your 
own personal feelings. Hillary Clinton 
demonstrated leadership that day. 
I take the floor today to ask why 
Donald Trump won’t put the country 
over his personal feelings, but I par-
ticularly want to ask my Republican 
Senate colleagues: Why won’t you ask 
the President of your party to do the 
right thing and put the interests of the 
country over personal or partisan pur-
suits? 
It is now 9 days after election day. It 
is 5 days since all major news organiza-
tions called the Presidential election 
for Joe Biden and KAMALA
HARRIS. 
Donald Trump is now behind in the 
popular vote by more than 5 million 
votes, and that number is rising. Some 
suggest that the ultimate margin will 
be closer to 7 million votes. Donald 
Trump is behind in the key States of 
Pennsylvania, 
Michigan, 
and 
Wis-
consin—not by the 77,000-vote margin 
of 4 years ago but by nearly 220,000 
votes, and that number is going up 
every day. Donald Trump has lost two 
other key States that he won in 2016— 
Georgia and Arizona. Yet how is Presi-
dent Trump acting? Like a spoiled 
child. 
But it is not just a childish refusal to 
concede a loss; in his weakness, he is 
willing to speak and act in ways de-
structive to our democracy. He has not 
reached out to President-Elect Biden. 
He has not conceded. He and his White 
House team are instructing Federal 
agencies not to cooperate with the 
Biden transition. He is not allowing 
congressionally appropriated moneys 
to be used by the Biden transition. He 
is spreading unfounded rumors about 
voter fraud or irregularities without 
meaningful evidence. He is trashing 
hard-working election officials—even 
Republican officials—with his baseless 
claims. As reported yesterday by Mili-
tary.com, his legal team is even brand-
ing as fraudulent ballots sent in by 
American service men and women and 
their families. 
Just as ominous, President Trump is 
starting a purge of officials at the Pen-
tagon, beginning with the firing of De-
fense Secretary Mark Esper. The offi-
cials the President is now jamming 
into short-term acting roles at the 
Pentagon include some who are un-
qualified and some who even Repub-
lican members of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee have previously 
determined are unfit to serve. These 
actions send a message of chaos and in-
stability to adversaries around the 
world at the very time when the United 
States should be trying to send a mes-
sage of calm and order. 
It is futile to ask President Trump to 
put country over his personal interests. 
He has not been willing to do that. But 
I do ask my Senate Republican col-
leagues: Won’t you concede that the 
country has elected a new President? 
Won’t you speak out against baseless 
claims of voter fraud that whip up dan-
gerous division at home, demean hard- 
working election officials, and paint an 
embarrassing picture of the United 
States around the world? Won’t you de-
mand that the Trump administration 
allow the Biden transition team the re-
sources that we in Congress have pro-
vided to assist in that important task?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6669 
November 12, 2020 
Won’t you ask the President to avoid 
massive firings or other personnel ac-
tions in the lameduck period that 
heighten the sense of American insta-
bility? Won’t you stand up for the 
proposition that peaceful transfers of 
power are a sacred part of our Amer-
ican heritage? 
I recently took a look at comments 
that I made on the floor at this very 
spot on February 4. I was worried then, 
but my comments read even more 
frightening now. I stood here to explain 
my vote for impeachment. I said then: 
‘‘Unchallenged evil spreads like a virus. We 
have allowed a toxic President to infect the 
Senate and warp its behavior. An acquittal 
will lead to worse behavior.’’ 
The acquittal of this President has 
led to worse behavior. He is willing to 
demean our democracy in the eyes of 
the world because he is too weak to ac-
knowledge that he lost an election. But 
there is still time for the Senate to be 
the adult leaders that this Nation so 
badly needs. Patriotic and mature lead-
ership will not come from the Presi-
dent or the administration. The Senate 
must provide it. 
And in the Senate, at this moment, 
strong Republican leadership to con-
demn President Trump’s foolishness is 
key. When we Democrats stand up 
against the President, it makes little 
difference. We just get discounted by 
the President and his supporters. They 
are quickly forming a dangerous ‘‘Lost 
Cause’’ mythology about a stolen elec-
tion. Every single Member of this 
Chamber knows that the myth that is 
being perpetrated is a lie. But some 
people will fall for the myth unless Re-
publicans are willing to stand up and 
call out the lie. 
The next 10 weeks are filled with 
peril. With COVID cases rising, hos-
pitalizations increasing, deaths trag-
ically multiplying, and people and 
businesses still suffering, we should be 
laser-focused on crushing this virus 
and rebuilding the American economy. 
The United States does not have the 
luxury to engage in conspiracy theories 
and multiple bogus election challenges. 
To my colleagues, especially my Re-
publican colleagues, the Nation needs 
the Senate right now to send a message 
of calm transition to a new administra-
tion. Please put our country first. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT 
Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to 
submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report for November 2020. 
This is my fourth scorekeeping report 
since I filed the deemed budget resolu-
tion for fiscal year 2021 on May 4, 2020, 
as required by the Bipartisan Budget 
Act of 2019, BBA19. The report com-
pares current-law levels of spending 
and revenues with the amounts agreed 
to in BBA19. In the Senate, this infor-
mation is used to determine whether 
budgetary points of order lie against 
pending legislation. The Republican 
staff of the Budget Committee and the 
Congressional Budget Office, CBO, pre-
pared this report pursuant to section 
308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act, 
CBA. The information included in this 
report is current through November 6, 
2020. 
Since I filed the last scorekeeping re-
port on September 10, 2020, two meas-
ures with significant enforceable budg-
etary effects have been enacted. The 
first measure, the Continuing Appro-
priations Act, 2021 and Other Exten-
sions Act, P.L. 116–159, continued fund-
ing for all 12 annual appropriations 
bills through December 11, 2020, and ex-
tended or modified numerous surface 
transportation, healthcare, nutrition 
and commodities, veterans’ health and 
benefits, and immigration programs 
and policies. The authorizing non- 
emergency provisions of the bill, which 
were scored to the Finance (Division 
C), Agriculture (Division D), and Vet-
erans’ Affairs (Division E) committees, 
would increase the deficit $97.6 billion 
in fiscal year 2021, $7.1 billion over fis-
cal year 2021–2025, and $8.4 billion over 
fiscal year 2021–2030. The bill passed the 
Senate by a vote of 84–10. 
The second measure, the Extension of 
the Caribbean Basin Economic Recov-
ery Act, P.L. 116–164, extended pref-
erential duty treatment for certain ap-
parel items produced in the Caribbean 
Basin through fiscal year 2030. It also 
extended the date through which cer-
tain customs user fees and merchandise 
processing fees may be collected from 
September 30, 2029, to October 21, 2029. 
CBO estimated the bill would decrease 
revenue by $299 million over the fiscal 
year 2021–2030 period, but the fee exten-
sions would reduce direct outlays by 
$435 million in fiscal year 2030. On net,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6670 
November 12, 2020 
the bill would reduce deficits by $136 
million over the fiscal year 2021–2030 
budget window. This bill cleared the 
Senate by unanimous consent and was 
charged to the Finance Committee. 
Budget Committee Republican staff 
prepared Tables A–D. 
Table A provides the amount by 
which each Senate authorizing com-
mittee exceeds or falls below its alloca-
tions for budget authority and outlays 
under the fiscal year 2021 deemed budg-
et resolutions. This information is used 
for enforcing committee allocations 
pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. As 
the table shows, five committees are 
currently out of compliance with their 
allocations. The Finance Committee’s 
fiscal year 2021 breach is the largest for 
this recording period and primarily 
stems from Division C, title V of P.L. 
116–159, which provided accelerated and 
advanced payments to Medicare pro-
viders. CBO estimated that these ad-
vanced payments would be recouped in 
future years. 
Table B provides the amount by 
which the Senate Committee on Appro-
priations is below or exceeds the statu-
tory spending limits. This information 
is used to determine points of order re-
lated to the spending caps found in sec-
tions 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropria-
tions for fiscal year 2021, displayed in 
this table, show that the Appropria-
tions Committee is currently compli-
ant with spending limits for fiscal year 
2021. As of this filing, no full-year an-
nual appropriations bills have been en-
acted and figures displayed represent 
advanced and permanent appropria-
tions previously provided as well as 
full-year anomalies from the most re-
cently enacted continuing resolution. 
Notably, P.L. 116–159 provided a full- 
year annual appropriation of $13 mil-
lion for costs associated with the up-
coming Presidential inauguration in 
January. This appropriation is cat-
egorized as nonsecurity and has been 
charged to the Financial Services and 
General Government subcommittee. 
Table C displays figures related to 
the limit on the use of changes in man-
datory programs, CHIMPs, in appro-
priations bills. This $15 billion CHIMP 
limitation for fiscal year 2021 is found 
in section 207 of BBA19. The Appropria-
tions Committee is currently in com-
pliance with this limit. 
Table D provides the amount of budg-
et authority enacted for fiscal year 2021 
that has been designated as either for 
an emergency or for overseas contin-
gency operations—OCO—pursuant to 
section 251 (b)(2)(A) of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985, as amended. Funding that 
receives either of these designations 
results in cap adjustments to enforce-
able 
discretionary 
spending 
limits. 
There are no limits on either emer-
gency or OCO spending; however, any 
Senator may challenge the designation 
with a point of order to strike the des-
ignation on the floor. No new budget 
authority with either of these designa-
tions has been enacted for fiscal year 
2021. 
In addition to the tables provided by 
Budget Committee Republican staff, I 
am submitting CBO tables which I will 
use to enforce budget totals approved 
by Congress. 
For fiscal year 2021, CBO annualizes 
the effects of the last continuing reso-
lution, which provides funding through 
December 11, 2020. For the enforcement 
of budgetary aggregates under section 
311 of the CBA, the Budget Committee 
historically excludes temporary fund-
ing. As such, the current law levels, 
which exclude the temporary effects of 
the continuing resolution, are $1,079.0 
billion and $569.6 billion in budget au-
thority 
and 
outlays, 
respectively, 
below allowable levels, Tables 1 and 2. 
This spending room will be spent down 
as regular appropriations bills are en-
acted for the budget year. Revenues ex-
ceed assumed levels by $267 million, 
$1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion over the fis-
cal year 2021, fiscal year 2021–2025, and 
fiscal year 2021–2030 periods, respec-
tively. Social Security levels are at the 
levels assumed by the fiscal year 2021 
deemed budget. 
CBO’s report also provides informa-
tion needed to enforce the Senate Pay- 
As-You-Go, PAYGO, rule, table 3. This 
rule is enforced under section 4106 of 
the 2018 budget resolution. The Senate 
PAYGO scorecard currently shows en-
acted deficit increases in every en-
forceable window. The largest debit on 
the scorecard is $17.1 billion over the 
fiscal year 2020–2030 period. The deficit 
increases caused by the authorizing 
provisions of the most recently enacted 
continuing resolution were excluded 
from the PAYGO scorecard pursuant to 
a direction in that law. 
This submission also includes a table 
tracking the Senate’s budget enforce-
ment activity on the floor since the en-
forcement filing on May 4, 2020. No 
points of order have been raised since 
my September report. 
All years in the accompanying tables 
are fiscal years. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
U.S. CONGRESS, 
Washington, DC, November 12, 2020. 
Hon. MIKE ENZI, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, 
U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on 
the fiscal year 2021 budget and is current 
through November 6, 2020. This report is sub-
mitted under section 308(b) and in aid of sec-
tion 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, as 
amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the 
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
May 4, 2020, pursuant to section 205 of the Bi-
partisan Budget Act of 2019 (Public Law 116– 
37). 
Since our last current level dated Sep-
tember 4, 2020, the Congress has cleared and 
the President has signed the following legis-
lation that has significant effects on budget 
authority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal year 
2021: 
Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and 
Other Extensions Act (Public Law 116–159); 
and 
Extension of the Caribbean Basin Eco-
nomic Recovery Act (Public Law 116–164). 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL. 
Enclosure.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $474 million in budget authority and $732 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020, by the Chairman of the Senate Com-
mittee on the Budget pursuant to section 205 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37) do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not in-
clude those items. 
c Current level excludes budgetary effects designated as an emergency pursuant to section 4112 of H. Con. Res. 71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018. As a result, this report excludes 
$68,534 million in budget authority, $72,977 million in outlays, and all revenue effects stemming from legislation enacted before the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget published aggregate spending and revenues for fiscal 
year 2021 in the Congressional Record on May 4, 2020. It also excludes the budgetary effects of other laws, enacted this session, which were designated as emergency requirements in accordance with section 4112 of H. Con. Res. 71.

WORLD DAY OF REMEMBERANCE 
FOR ROAD TRAFFIC VICTIMS 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
November 15, 2020, will mark the 25th 
World Day of Remembrance for Road 
Traffic Victims, commemorating the 
millions of people killed and injured on 
the world’s roads. It is also a day to 
thank emergency responders for their 
role in saving lives; to reflect on the 
impact of road traffic deaths and inju-
ries on families and communities; and 
to draw attention to the need for im-
proved legislation, awareness, infra-
structure, and technology to save more 
families from the tragedy of losing a 
loved one. 
More than 1 million people die from 
road crashes every year, and tens of 
millions are seriously injured. Road 
traffic crashes are the No. 1 killer of 
young people aged 15–29 and the eighth 
leading cause of death among all peo-
ple worldwide. Rochelle Sobel, Presi-
dent of the Association for Safe Inter-
national Road Travel, highlighted the 
gravity of this issue and the imperative 
to fix it: ‘‘Every 27 seconds, somewhere 
in the world, a person dies in a road 
crash.’’ 
On the 25th anniversary of World Day 
of Remembrance for Road Traffic Vic-
tims, it is important to remember the 
history and recommit to the goals of 
this day. It was initiated in 1995 as the 
European Day of Remembrance and 
quickly spread around the globe to 
countries in Africa, South America, 
and Asia. In 2005, the United Nations 
General Assembly adopted Resolution 
60/2, recognizing November 15 as the 
World Day of Remembrance for Road 
Traffic Victims. Since that time, the 
observance of this day has continued to 
spread to a growing number of coun-
tries on every continent. 
This year, the stated goals of World 
Day of Remembrance 2020 include re-
membering all people killed and seri-
ously injured on the roads, acknowl-
edging the crucial work of the emer-
gency services, advocating for better 
support to road traffic victims and 
their families, and promoting evidence- 
based actions to prevent and eventu-
ally stop further road traffic deaths 
and injuries. 
Indeed, the day has become an impor-
tant moment to focus international at-
tention on this preventable epidemic 
and as an advocacy tool in global ef-
forts to reduce road casualties. As a re-
sult of the growing awareness and glob-
al call to action that World Day of Re-
membrance for Road Traffic Victims 
has generated, in September 2020, the 
United Nations passed a resolution de-
claring the years 2021 to 2030 a new 
Decade of Action for Road Safety. The 
declaration affirms the UN’s commit-
ment to work vigorously to implement 
a new, ambitious agenda to halve road 
crash deaths by 2030. 
Additionally, 
the 
United 
Nations 
Sustainable Development Goal 3.6 calls 
on 
governments 
and 
their 
stake-
holders, including NGOs and private 
citizens, to address the personal, med-
ical, and financial burdens associated 
with road traffic deaths and injuries. 
The devastation of losing a child, 
parent, sibling, partner, friend, care-
giver, or caretaker; the struggle of hav-
ing to care for a permanently disabled 
loved one, these are incalculable. Road 
traffic crashes are preventable, and so 
we owe it to our communities to work 
together so that the hopes and dreams 
of our loved ones are not shattered on 
the roads of the United States and the

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SHERIE ALLEN 
∑ Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I offer 
my recognition of the service of Sherie 
Allen to Utah mothers and children. 
Adopted in Lancaster, CA, in 1965, 
around 3 months of age, Sherie was 
raised in a home that frequently and 
openly discussed her adoption. This ex-
perience instilled a passion to serve 
those in need of love and home. 
Sherie’s late husband also understood 
the goodwill in adoption, and together, 
they formed a family with eight chil-
dren, four biological and four adopted. 
Of her four adopted children, one now 
lives in assisted living, two have grad-
uated college with bachelor’s degrees 
in biology, and the other is a high 
school student. Sherie and her late 
husband were also foster parents, pro-
viding love and care for many children 
before those children were placed into 
their forever homes and families. 
In February of 2019, Sherie started 
Ohana 
Beginnings 
where 
she 
now 
serves as CEO and executive board 
chair. Ohana Beginnings offers support 
for expectant mothers facing an un-
planned 
pregnancy 
who 
choose 
to 
marry, place their baby for adoption, 
or single parent. The organization’s 
Taking Flight Initiative offers services 
that include housing, food, clothing, 
medical care, therapeutic services, and 
academic support. This initiative is in-
dividually designed to fit the unique 
circumstances of the expectant or par-
enting mother to set her up for future 
success. 
This September, the Congressional 
Coalition 
on 
Adoption 
Institute— 
CCAI—honored Sherie and other out-
standing individuals who have dem-
onstrated a commitment to improving 
the lives of children in need of perma-
nent, loving homes. Sherie’s work and 
dedication toward serving the needs of 
expectant mothers and children has 
earned her the Angels in Adoption Hon-
oree award. Sherie is a powerful advo-
cate for pro-family values and has com-
mitted her time, gifts, and resources to 
strengthening families, helping young 
mothers, and protecting babies through 
Ohana Beginnings.∑

RECOGNIZING IDAHO SEWING FOR 
SPORTS 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, as a mem-
ber and former chairman of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and En-
trepreneurship, each month I recognize 
and celebrate the American entrepre-
neurial spirit by highlighting the suc-
cess of a small business in my home 
State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to 
honor Idaho Sewing for Sports in 
Grangeville as the Idaho Small Busi-
ness of the month for November 2020. 
Idaho Sewing for Sports—ISS—is a 
manufacturer of custom padding and 
coverings for ski resorts and summer 
recreation destinations throughout the 
globe. In 1986, founders Gail and Will 
Williams returned from a business trip 
to Canada and found themselves in 
Grangeville, ID. It was during this stop 
they were captivated by its natural 
beauty, lifestyle, and community. As a 
result of this experience, the Williams 
decided to relocate their family and 
business to Grangeville, where it has 
operated for nearly 25 years. 
ISS has developed a reputation for 
producing high-quality custom cov-
erings for lift seats, wall and tower 
paddings, zip lines, and other resort in-
frastructure. Since its relocation to 
Idaho, ISS has grown to be one of the 
largest custom padding manufacturers 
in America. While the Williams have 
since retired from the business’ day-to- 
day operations, their son Gunther and 
his wife Joy now manage the business. 
In addition to operating a successful 
business, ISS has been integral to aid-
ing the community’s COVID–19 relief 
efforts. As a board member of the Sy-
ringa Hospital in Grangeville, Gunther 
Williams learned that the hospital was 
experiencing a shortage of gowns and 
masks. In response, Gunther jumped 
into action and directed his staff to co-
ordinate with the hospital to develop 
medical grade gowns and masks. Sy-
ringa Hospital supplied ISS with the 
patterns it needed to produce the 
gowns and provided surgical blankets 
to produce masks. Through their he-
roic collaboration, ISS produced thou-
sands of gowns and masks at cost that 
were distributed to hospitals and first 
responders throughout the country. 
Congratulations to Gunther, Joy, and 
all of the hard-working employees of 
Idaho Sewing for Sports on being se-
lected as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for November 2020. Your 
commitment to service and community 
is humbling, and you make our great 
State proud. I look forward to your 
continued growth and success.∑

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petition or memorial 
was laid before the Senate and was re-
ferred or ordered to lie on the table as 
indicated: 
POM–248. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan condemning Azerbaijan’s Coordi-
nated Offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh and 
denouncing Turkish interference in the con-
flict, and urging the United States Depart-
ment of State to work with the Co-Chairs of 
the Minsk Group and the Governments of Ar-
menia, Azerbaijan, and the Republic of 
Artsakh to achieve long-lasting and peaceful 
resolution to this conflict; to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 319 
Whereas, Nagorno-Karabakh, also known 
as Artsakh, is a territory located in the 
South Caucasus region that has historically 
been populated by ethnic Armenians and is 
governed by the Republic of Artsakh; and 
Whereas, The people of Artsakh over-
whelmingly voted to support independence. 
On December 10, 1991, despite continued vio-
lence against the people of Artsakh, a pop-
ular referendum proclaiming an independent 
republic took place during the disintegration 
of the Soviet Union. Under the watchful eye 
of more than 50 international observers, and 
in full compliance with international stand-
ards for a free and fair election, more than 80 
percent of eligible voters cast a ballot, and 
the measure passed with 98 percent in favor. 
On January 6, 1992, the democratically elect-
ed Parliament of Artsakh adopted the Dec-
laration of Independence of the Nagorno- 
Karabakh Republic; and 
Whereas, The State of Michigan supported 
the recognition of the independence of the 
Republic of Artsakh with the passage of Sen-
ate Resolution 99 of 2017; and 
Whereas, Since September 27, 2020, Azer-
baijan has engaged in the most significant 
military operation along the line of contact 
with Nagorno-Karabakh since the signing of 
the cease-fire agreement between Azerbaijan 
and Armenia in 1994. This attack follows in-
creasingly aggressive rhetoric and desta-
bilizing actions on the part of Azerbaijan 
President Ilham Aliyev’s government to-
wards Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia, in-
cluding a July 2020 Defense Ministry threat 
to bomb Armenia’s Metsamor Nuclear Power 
Plant; and 
Whereas, Azerbaijan’s ongoing military of-
fensive, which includes the shelling of 
Stepanakert, 
Nagorno-Karabakh’s 
most 
densely populated city with a population of 
55,200, has resulted in the deaths of dozens of 
civilians and wounded hundreds. The conflict 
has resulted in the deaths of at least 84 
Nagorno-Karabakh service members: and 
Whereas, Both Armenia and Azerbaijan 
have declared martial law, mobilized their 
armed forces, and called up reserve forces; 
and 
Whereas, According to multiple news re-
ports, 
Azerbaijan’s 
military 
actions 
in 
Nagorno-Karabakh may be part of a planned 
military operation. The conflict follows joint 
military exercises conducted by Turkey and 
Azerbaijan in August 2020. News accounts 
state that in weeks prior to Azerbaijan’s 
military operation, Turkey recruited merce-
naries from Syria and has facilitated their 
deployment to Azerbaijan. Additionally, the 
Armenian Foreign Ministry claims that Tur-
key is operating F–16 fighter jets in the re-
gion and shot down an Armenian Su–25 fight-
er jet in Armenian airspace, killing the 
pilot; and 
Whereas, The conflict has the potential to 
escalate into proxy warfare among regional 
powers, including Turkey, and to further en-
trench the conflict and threaten peace and 
stability in the region. The United States, 
France, and Russia serve as co-chairs of the 
Minsk Group tasked with finding a peaceful 
solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. 
The co-chairs have urged a cease-fire and ad-
vised the parties to return to substantive ne-
gotiations as soon as possible. The European 
Union and the United Nations support a 
peaceful resolution and immediate cease- 
fire: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we condemn Azerbaijan’s coordinated 
offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh and denounce 
Turkish interference in the conflict; and be 
it further 
Resolved, That we urge the United States 
Department of State to work with the co- 
chairs of the Minsk Group and the govern-
ments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the Re-
public of Artsakh to achieve a long-lasting 
and peaceful resolution to this conflict; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the United States Secretary of State, 
the President of the United States Senate, 
the Speaker of the United States House of 
Representatives, and members of the Michi-
gan congressional delegation. 
f

THE SENATE 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following letter 
from the Secretary of the Senate,

S. RES. 768 
Whereas the first Rail Safety Week was 
held from September 24 through September 
30, 2017, by the national education safety 
nonprofit Operation Lifesaver, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and other organiza-
tions; 
Whereas Rail Safety Week was launched to 
raise awareness about the need for increased 
education on how to be safe around highway- 
rail grade crossings and railroad tracks and

sions, injuries, and fatalities; 
Whereas highway-rail grade crossing and 
trespassing accidents constituted approxi-
mately 97 percent of all rail related fatalities 
during 2019; 
Whereas since 2005— 
(1) the number of public crossings has de-
creased by 8 percent; and 
(2) the number of gates at public crossings 
has increased by 36 percent; 
Whereas in 2019, 49 percent of all grade 
crossing collisions and 65 percent of all fatal 
grade crossing collisions occurred at gated

Whereas preliminary Federal statistics in-
dicate that 2,228 highway-grade crossing col-
lisions occurred in the United States in 2019, 
resulting in 299 deaths and the injury of an-
other 822 individuals; 
Whereas many collisions between trains 
and motor vehicles or pedestrians could have 
been prevented by increased education, engi-
neering, and enforcement; 
Whereas Operation Lifesaver, the foremost 
public information and education program 
on rail safety, administers a public edu-
cation program about grade-crossing safety 
and trespassing prevention; 
Whereas during Rail Safety Week, from 
September 20 through 26, and throughout the 
year, everyone is encouraged to take added 
caution as motorists or pedestrians approach 
tracks or trains; 
Whereas the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico will concurrently observe Rail Safety 
Week; and 
Whereas this important observance should 
lead to greater safety awareness and a reduc-
tion in highway-rail grade crossing crashes 
and pedestrian and railroad incidents: Now, 
therefore, be it

(1) supports the designation of Rail Safety 
Week;

Whereas, on January 3, 1981, Mark Andrews

Ms. SMITH (for herself, Mr. HOEVEN, 
Ms. 
BALDWIN, 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY, 
Ms. 
ERNST, and Mr. WYDEN) submitted the 
following resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 771 
Whereas, during the global COVID–19 pan-
demic, cooperatives have taken extraor-
dinary steps to serve their member-owners 
and communities; 
Whereas a cooperative— 
(1) is a business that is owned and governed 
by its members, who are the individuals who 
use the business, create the products of the 
business, or manage the operation of the 
business; and 
(2) operates under the 7 principles of— 
(A) voluntary open membership; 
(B) democratic control; 
(C) owner economic participation; 
(D) autonomy and independence; 
(E) education, training, and information; 
(F) cooperation among cooperatives; and 
(G) concern for community; 
Whereas cooperative entrepreneurs can be 
found in almost every economic sector of the 
United States, throughout all 50 States and 
territories, and in every congressional dis-
trict of the United States; 
Whereas cooperatives help farmers in-
crease incomes and become more resilient to 
economic business cycles by working to-
gether to plan and prepare for the future, 
while contributing significantly to the eco-
nomic activity in the agriculture and food 
markets of the United States; 
Whereas the roughly 1,800 agricultural co-
operatives in the United States operate more 
than 8,000 facilities, employ $96,000,000,000 
worth 
of 
assets, 
and 
generate 
nearly 
$204,000,000,000 in business annually; 
Whereas the majority of the 2,000,000 farm-
ers in the United States belong to an agricul-
tural cooperative; 
Whereas agricultural cooperatives offer 
members the opportunity to access com-
modity value-added profits throughout the 
handling, 
processing, 
and 
distribution 
chains; 
Whereas member-owners of agricultural 
cooperatives are dedicated to providing the 
highest quality product for consumers; 
Whereas agricultural cooperatives add sig-
nificant benefits to the economic well-being 
of rural areas of the United States by pro-
viding more than 250,000 jobs with annual 
wages totaling more than $8,000,000,000; 
Whereas agricultural cooperatives provide 
resources to their member-owners, such as 
low-cost supplies, effective marketing, and 
services; 
Whereas farmer members of agricultural 
cooperatives have the opportunity to pool re-
sources and reinvest profits into the commu-
nities of the farmer members; 
Whereas the principles of cooperation and 
the 
cooperative 
business 
model 
help 
smallholder farmers organize themselves and 
gain access to local and global markets, 
training, improved inputs, and aggregated 
sales and marketing; 
Whereas the cooperative business model 
provides farmers ownership over their eco-
nomic decisions, a focus on learning, and a 
broader understanding of environmental and 
social concerns; 
Whereas the cooperative business model 
has been used throughout the history of the 
United States to advance civil rights and to 
help ensure that all individuals have equal 
access to economic opportunity; 
Whereas the comprehensive global food se-
curity strategy established under section 5 of 
the Global Food Security Act of 2016 (22 
U.S.C. 9304) (commonly known as ‘‘Feed the 
Future’’) and the Cooperative Development 
Program of the United States Agency for 
International Development use cooperative 
principles 
and

model to advance international develop-
ment, nutrition, resilience, and economic se-
curity; 
Whereas the Interagency Working Group 
on Cooperative Development— 
(1) is an interagency group that is coordi-
nated and chaired by the Secretary of Agri-
culture to foster cooperative development 
and ensure coordination with Federal agen-
cies and national and local cooperative orga-
nizations that have cooperative programs 
and interests; and 
(2) as of the date of introduction of this 
resolution, had organized 4 meetings; 
Whereas the bipartisan Congressional Co-
operative Business Caucus unites Members of 
Congress to— 
(1) create a better-informed electorate and 
a more educated public on the important 
role that cooperatives play in the economy 
of the United States and the world; 
(2) 
promote 
the 
cooperative 
business 
model, because that model ensures that con-
sumers have access to high-quality goods 
and services at competitive prices and costs 
that improve the lives of individuals, fami-
lies, and their communities; and 
(3) address and correct awareness chal-
lenges among the public and within the Fed-
eral Government relating to what coopera-
tives look like, who participates in coopera-
tives, where cooperatives are located, and 
why individuals choose cooperatives; 
Whereas the Bureau of the Census, as part 
of the 2017 Economic Census, asked each 
business if the business was organized as a 
cooperative, and the responses of businesses 
yielded both quantitative and qualitative 
data on the effects and importance of co-
operatives across the economy of the United 
States; 
Whereas, throughout rural areas of the 
United States, many utility service pro-
viders operate as cooperatives and are tasked 
with the delivery of public services, such as 
electricity, water, telecommunications, and 
broadband, in areas where investor-owned 
utility companies typically do not operate; 
Whereas utility cooperatives have inno-
vated to meet the evolving needs of their 
member-owners and help rural individuals in 
the United States prosper; 
Whereas, in the financial services sector, 
cooperatives, including credit unions, farm 
credit banks, and other financing organiza-
tions that lend to cooperatives, provide nu-
merous benefits to the member-owners of 
those cooperatives; 
Whereas member-owners of cooperatives 
vote in board elections, and earned profits 
cycle back into cost-saving programs or re-
turn as dividend payments; 
Whereas purchasing and shared service co-
operatives allow independent and franchise 
businesses to thrive; 
Whereas food cooperatives range in size 
from small, local buying clubs to multi-store 
regional giants that compete with chain 
stores with locations across the United 
States; 
Whereas, in the housing sector, housing co-
operatives and resident-owned communities 
in which members own the building or land— 
(1) are an alternative to conventional rent-
al apartments, manufactured home parks, 
and condominiums; and 
(2) empower each resident with ownership 
and responsibility; 
Whereas housing cooperatives have roots 
dating to the late 1800s and are increasingly 
becoming a housing alternative for students 
at colleges throughout the United States; 
Whereas shared equity housing coopera-
tives are a critical option for preserving 
long-term, affordable housing; 
Whereas cooperatives allow residents of 
manufactured home communities to collec-
tively purchase the land on which they live, 
providing stability and the opportunity to 
self-govern; 
Whereas, as of 2019, not less than 1,000 
manufactured home communities were resi-
dent-owned, accounting for approximately 2 
percent of all manufactured home commu-
nities; 
Whereas the growth of worker cooperatives 
in the United States is allowing more work-
ers to own and have greater control over 
their businesses; 
Whereas many small businesses convert to 
cooperatives when faced with closure or a 
buyout, ensuring the business can continue 
to serve its community; and 
Whereas the cooperative business model al-
lows business owners to retire and transfer 
business ownership to employees or con-
sumers, protecting local ownership and sup-
porting local communities: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates October 2020 as ‘‘National 
Co-op Month’’; 
(2) commends the cooperative business 
model for— 
(A) its contributions to the economy; 
(B) the jobs it creates; and 
(C) its positive impacts on local commu-
nities; 
(3) expresses confidence in, and support for, 
cooperatives to continue their successes; and 
(4) will be mindful in crafting legislation 
that affects business models that are not the 
cooperative business model so that the legis-
lation does not adversely affect the coopera-
tive business model.

Whereas the entire Lakers organization, 
including owner Jeanie Buss, general man-

tinuing the excellence of the franchise; 
Whereas the Lakers overcame an unprece-
dented 
season 
stemming 
from 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, including a shutdown 
that lasted more than 3 months and 95 days 
inside the NBA ‘‘bubble’’; 
Whereas Lebron James was named Most 
Valuable Player of the NBA Finals for the 
fourth time, averaging 29.8 points, 11.8 re-
bounds, and 8.5 assists per game, while 
shooting 59.1 percent from the field per

Whereas the entire Lakers team and orga-
nization honored the legacy of Lakers legend 
Kobe Bryant by winning the 2020 NBA Cham-
pionship, 
showing 
‘‘Mamba 
Mentality’’ 
throughout the playoffs; and 
Whereas, although fans of the Lakers could 
not be in the arena to cheer on their team, 
Lakers Nation was vital in showing un-
matched support for the team on the way to 
an NBA Championship: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Los Angeles Lakers 
for winning the 2020 National Basketball As-
sociation Championship;

the entire Los Angeles Lakers organization,

dented 2020 pandemic season, playing a key 
role in motivating their team to victory: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the Los Angeles Dodgers 
for winning the 2020 Major League Baseball 
World Series; 
(2) recognizes the unprecedented nature of 
the 2020 baseball season and the commitment 
of the Los Angeles Dodgers to bringing the 
Commissioner’s Trophy to Los Angeles; and 
(3) respectfully directs the Secretary of the 
Senate to transmit an enrolled copy of this 
resolution to— 
(A) the chairman and controlling owner of 
the Los Angeles Dodgers, Mark Walter; 
(B) the president of the Los Angeles Dodg-
ers, Stan Kasten; and 
(C) the manager of the 2020 Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Dave Roberts.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1013 
November 12, 2020 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. ANTHONY G. BROWN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam Speaker, 
on October 2, 2020, I was absent from the 
House 
of 
Representatives. 
Had 
I 
been 
present, I would have voted ‘‘YEA’’ on Roll 
Call No. 217, on Agreeing to the Resolution 
Condemning unwanted, unnecessary medical 
procedures on individuals without their full, in-
formed consent. 
This resolution, which I am an original co-
sponsor of, rightfully condemns medical prac-
tices at the Irwin County Detention Center 
(ICDC), in Ocilla, Georgia, which may have re-
sulted in unwanted and unnecessary surgeries 
that, in some cases, are reported to have re-
sulted in life altering injuries to the reproduc-
tive health of immigrant women held at that fa-
cility. Reproductive health is an essential com-
ponent of women’s health and the rights of 
women to control medical decisions about 
their bodies is invaluable. This resolution 
states in no unwavering terms that any deci-
sions made regarding the health of immigrants 
held in ICE custody must include informed 
consent. These are violations of individuals’ 
human rights and must be investigated fully.

HONORING RODERICK BRADFORD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious man, Mr. Roderick Bradford. Rod-
erick has shown what can be done through 
hard work, dedication and a desire to serve 
others. 
Roderick is a graduate of Grambling State 
University, where he earned a Bachelor of 
Science degree in Management in 1999. 
He has more than 20 years of management 
experience and seven-plus years of special-
ized experience in the financial services indus-
try, after working for both Capital One and 
Chase Home Mortgage. 
Roderick serves in the Men’s Ministry at 
Calvary Baptist Church and is an active mem-
ber of the Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. Rod-
erick is a veteran of the United States Air 
Force, where he served his country from 1989 
to 1991. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mr. Roderick Bradford for 
his passion and dedication to serving Warren 
County and desire to make a difference in the 
community. 
IN HONOR OF CHARLES REED 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Charles Reed of Hun-
tingdon County for his service in the United 
States Army. He is an outstanding Pennsylva-
nian, and I am grateful for his service to our 
nation, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 
and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered 
the call to serve and fight for us—at a great 
cost. Truly, our veterans are the best of Amer-
ica. 
In Congress, it is my privilege—and my re-
sponsibility—to stand up for those who have 
served our country in uniform, as well as to 
recognize these brave Americans. As a nation, 
we are indebted to them. On behalf of the 
13th Congressional District, I thank Mr. Reed 
for his service to our nation and our commu-
nity. 
f 
PAT WALKER RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Pat Walker and her con-
tributions to bettering the Lowcountry, one 
meal at a time. For the past eight years, Pat 
has served as the President and CEO of the 
Lowcountry Food Bank and helped increase 
their efforts for food distribution of under-
served communities in our district. 
Pat’s entire life has been about service to 
others—from a 30-year career in education as 
a high school teacher and guidance counselor, 
followed by her 10 years at East Cooper 
Meals on Wheels as President and CEO prior 
to joining the Lowcountry Food Bank in 2012. 
As her friends and colleagues will tell you, 
Pat’s job is not as much an occupation as it 
is higher calling. Her legacy to the organiza-
tion includes exceeding all goals established 
by Feeding America and expanding into the 
10 coastal counties of South Carolina with 
three food distribution centers along the coast. 
Pat Walker will now get to enjoy a well-de-
served retirement and can rest assured that 
her tenure at the Lowcountry Food Bank 
leaves a blueprint for further growth. I thank 
Pat for her service to the Lowcountry. It is 
leaders like her that make our community a 
better place for everyone to live. 
HONORING CSU CHANCELLOR 
TIMOTHY P. WHITE 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize California State University (CSU) Chan-
cellor Timothy P. White and congratulate him 
on his retirement. 
Dr. White has left a lasting mark on Cali-
fornia public education. His story is an inspira-
tion to all, and I am grateful for the doors he 
has opened for students in my district and 
throughout the State of California. 
Born in Argentina, Dr. White immigrated as 
a child with his parents to Canada and later to 
California. The first in his family to seek higher 
education, he earned his bachelor’s degree 
from California State University, Fresno. 
Dr. White continued his pursuit of learning— 
earning his master’s at California State Univer-
sity, East Bay, and a doctorate in exercise 
physiology at the University of California, 
Berkeley. He then went on to serve as cam-
pus president of Oregon State University, the 
University of Idaho, and the University of Cali-
fornia, Riverside (UCR). 
While at UCR, I worked under Dr. White as 
a founding Senior Associate Dean of Commu-
nity Engagement and Partnerships for UCR 
School of Medicine. Under his leadership and 
tenure, we successfully launched the UCR 
School of Medicine. Thanks to his commit-
ment, the school has an impressive mission to 
improve health disparities, better the popu-
lation’s health in the region, and address the 
physician shortage crisis by recruiting under-
represented students from medically under-
served communities. 
Over his decades-long career, Dr. White 
carried with him his belief ‘‘in the profound 
possibility of potential.’’ As CSU Chancellor, 
he worked to close the equality gap between 
underserved students and their peers by 
launching the Graduation Initiative 2025. While 
he led the nation’s largest and most diverse 
four-year public education system, he also 
worked to ensure that students could see 
themselves represented in university leader-
ship. With his commitment, the CSU system 
achieved more than 50 percent representation 
for women for campus presidents. 
Dr. White is a man of great integrity and 
character. He is a leader who cares deeply for 
the people he serves and believes in the 
cause of education and health equity. I am 
honored to have worked with him at UCR and 
am thankful for his commitment to improving 
the lives of others through higher education. 
The State of California owes a tremendous 
amount of gratitude to Dr. White for his serv-
ice to our state. 
On behalf of the great people of California’s 
36th Congressional District, I thank Dr. White. 
I am thrilled to join his family and loved ones 
in celebrating his well-deserved retirement.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ALFRED 
LLEWELLYN HOBGOOD III 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Alfred Llewellyn Hobgood III. 
Hobgood spent his entire life in North Caro-
lina. He was a successful businessman, a fix-
ture in the community and above all, a loving 
husband and father of two. 
Alfred Hobgood was born on December 3, 
1946 in Kinston, North Carolina to Alfred 
Llewellyn Hobgood, Jr. and Suefan Gooding 
Hobgood. 
He was raised in Smithfield and attended 
Darlington High School before attending the 
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His 
time at UNC was formative to his life and the 
lessons he learned set him up for a successful 
career in the business world. 
After leaving UNC, he began his career 
under the arms of Jim Wheat of Wheat First 
Securities. 
Then he went to Scott and Stringfellow in 
Eastern North Carolina. After that, he went on 
to work for RBC Wealth Management, where 
he served as Senior Vice President. 
Alfred was a passionate UNC fan and an 
active alumnus, serving as an officer on sev-
eral boards, including as president of the Co- 
Founders Club and chairman of the Excel-
lence Fund. 
Alfred was also an avid golfer. He was a 
founding board member of Old Chatham Golf 
Club and a board member of The Rex Hos-
pital Open. And he passionately supported the 
First Tee of the Triangle as a past Director. 
His weight as a member of the community 
was felt all over North Carolina as he sup-
ported the Parrot Academy of Kinston, the 
LMH Foundation, the University of North Caro-
lina at Chapel Hill, St. Mary’s School in Ra-
leigh, Rex Hospital, and many other charitable 
causes. 
Sadly, Madam Speaker, Alfred Llewellyn 
Hobgood III passed away on October 6, 2019 
at the age of 72. He will be greatly missed by 
his family, friends, and the entire community.

HONORING AISHA ERMA LENORA 
SAFFOLD 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Aisha Erma 
Lenora Saffold, who is a pearl that begins as 
a particle of dust or dirt and finds its way in-
side an oyster. Then, the oyster coats the par-
ticle repeatedly over time—up to two to four 
years—until the finished product is a smooth, 
lustrous white pearl, which often has a value 
the same as a gemstone, ranging from hun-
dreds to even millions of dollars. 
They’re found at the bottom of the ocean. 
They take all the grime and the dust and the 
dirt from the sea, and they form this valuable 
gem. For bcnvhopes and dreams. 
Our P.E.A.R.L.S. members are led by young 
women who serve as mentors, and in tum, our 
mentors develop leadership skills that they will 
carry with them throughout life. We strive to 
help young teenage girls build self-esteem, 
develop leadership skills, and recognize com-
munity importance. 
She aspires to empower young women to 
believe in themselves and teach them that val-
idation comes from oneself. In a society where 
the media implants a false image of whom 
and what a young woman should resemble, 
she has vowed to take a stand to teach the 
contrary and impart knowledge and wisdom in 
PEARL’s lives. She wants every Mississippi 
girl to know that they are intelligent and beau-
tiful and can reach their goals and excel at all 
they put their hands towards. As long as they 
have someone in their corner backing and 
pushing them to pursue their dreams, they will 
attain them. 
She wants all of the world to know that 
good people and good things are happening in 
the Great State of Mississippi. 
Aisha knows that our Mississippi girls are 
future presidents, C.E.O.’s, ambassadors, pro-
ducers, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs, and 
by molding and shaping them, they can 
achieve so much more. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing and congratulating Mrs. 
Aisha Erma Lenora Saffold for being actively 
involved and making great accomplishments in 
Holmes County.

Huntingdon County for her service in the 
United States Navy. Louise is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for her serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
LEGACY 
OF 
ANTHONY 
‘‘TONY’’ VILLEGAS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with an aching but appreciative heart, 
on behalf of the Kansas City community and 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, to 
honor the memory of Anthony ‘‘Tony’’ Villegas. 
Kansas City has lost a kindred spirit and 
happy warrior, who dedicated his life to serv-
ing his community. 
Scripture tells us, in 1 Peter 4:10, to use 
whatever gifts we have received from God to 
serve others, faithfully administering God’s 
grace in its various forms. As a member of the 
Parish Council for the St. John Evangelist 
Church in Kansas City, Tony understood this 
call to service better than most. Tony was 
blessed with the gift of a loving family, a beau-
tiful marriage that would last sixty-one years, 
and an unrelentingly optimistic demeanor, and 
he turned those gifts into a lifetime of public 
service. He served on several boards and 
commissions working to strengthen our com-
munity throughout his life, including a quarter- 
century stint on the Board of Public Utilities. 
Believing that our city was at its best when ev-
eryone was given a fair shot, he worked tire-
lessly to promote inclusivity and unity. During 
his eight years on the Kansas Human Rights 
Commission, he worked to eliminate discrimi-
nation, segregation, and animus against peo-
ple of color trying to access public accom-
modations and affordable housing. And during 
his tenure as the Commissioner of the Kansas 
City, Kansas Housing Authority, he held fast to 
his belief that access to safe and affordable 
housing was a fundamental human right, and 
he rejoiced every time he helped a family se-
cure a place to call home. Today, families 
across Kansas City are safe and warm with 
roofs above their heads because of Tony’s un-
wavering support and enthusiastic advocacy. 
Tony’s work did not stop at promoting equal 
treatment under the law and investing in fami-
lies’ success through affordable housing; he 
also worked tirelessly to promote equal access 
to education. As a Board Member and Vice- 
President of El Centro for eight years, he 
worked to provide young Latino children with 
high-quality education. This education has pro-
vided the foundation for thousands of students 
to lead healthier lives, bolster their economic 
mobility, and advocate for the Latino commu-
nity through elections and policy initiatives. 
Through the Academy for Children and var-
ious after-school enrichment programs, El

Centro has created a nurturing environment 
for young Latino students to appreciate their 
culture and history while also preparing them 
to participate fully in Kindergarten and elemen-
tary school. Tony also served as a board 
member of the Hispanic Media Association 
Scholarship Fund and the University of Central 
Missouri’s Cesar E. Chavez Scholarship Com-
mittee. As a result of Tony’s impassioned 
fundraising, these scholarships have been 
able to award thousands of dollars to deserv-
ing Latino students pursuing higher education 
and working towards a brighter future for 
themselves and their families. 
Tony undoubtedly accomplished extraor-
dinary progress for his community during his 
life, and we in Kansas City celebrate him as 
a local hero. But when you talked with him, his 
work would never come up. When Tony would 
greet people with his infectious smile and at-
tentive ears, he wanted to hear about their 
lives, their families, and their struggles. If you 
needed to laugh, he was quick to deliver a 
joke. If you needed to cry, he would wrap his 
arm around you and make you remember that 
you were not going through dark times alone. 
Whether he was celebrating new life, working 
through life’s problems, or mourning the end 
of a life, Tony served as a bright light and 
beacon of hope wherever he was. As friends 
and family gather to remember how Tony 
helped them through their lives, that beacon of 
hope will continue to shine brightly in their 
memories. 
Today, Kansas City’s thoughts are with 
Tony’s wife, Mary, his two sons, Anthony Jr. 
and Aquilino, his daughter, Mary Kay Villegas- 
Alitz, and his many nieces, nephews, grand-
children, and great-grandchildren, as they cel-
ebrate Tony’s life and remember the moments 
of compassion and care he gave the world. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
Tony’s legacy and offering our deepest condo-
lences to his family. As we celebrate the ac-
complishments of a life well-lived, let us re-
member how Tony used his God-given gifts to 
serve others. We may never truly know the full 
impact he had on our community, but make no 
mistake: Tony’s legacy will live on through 
every young leader he inspired to continue 
that everlasting endeavor to promote equality, 
inclusivity, and opportunity. Put simply, Kan-
sas City is better off today, tomorrow, and for 
generations to come, because of the time 
Tony gave us.

RECOGNIZING ELAINE COUTURE 
HON. CATHY McMORRIS RODGERS 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Elaine Couture, 
who has served in the health care sector of 
this country for over 40 years. She has out-
standing 
professional 
accomplishments 
in 
nursing and has shown dedication to her staff, 
community, and people in need. 
Elaine Suzann Couture was born in Omaha, 
Nebraska on July 18, 1955, to parents Quen-
tin and Mildred Bohrer. At a young age, Elaine 
knew that she wanted to be a nurse. She vol-
unteered as a candy striper and went straight 
from high school to college at Montana State 
University-Bozeman in 1973. 
Upon graduation, she worked for 10 years 
at Saint Vincent Hospital in Billings, Montana 
from 1977 to 1987 first as a bedside nurse 
and a flight nurse. Her ability to lead others 
gave her the opportunity to move into man-
agement and eventually start a new occupa-
tional medicine department. In 1987, she start-
ed at Saint Mary Medical Center as the Em-
ployee Health Manager. She was quickly pro-
moted to the Director of Quality, and then 
Chief Nursing Officer. 
She left Saint Mary’s in 2002 for Sacred 
Heart, where she served faithfully for nearly a 
decade. In 2012, she was promoted to the Re-
gional Chief Executive for Providence Health 
& Services for nearly eight years before she 
was promoted to Executive Vice President, 
Chief Executive of Eastern Washington & 
Western Montana. She oversaw 13 hospitals 
and over 23,000 medical staff. 
Elaine has served the people of our state, 
region, and country with a strong sense of 
self, leadership, knowledge, and passion for 
her work. In addition to her responsibilities for 
Providence, she served on numerous national 
and community boards including the Federal 
Reserve Board, American Hospital Association 
Rural Task Force, Washington State Hospital 
Association Board of Directors, Greater Spo-
kane Incorporated Governing Board, Wash-
ington State University Advisory Board and 
Spokane’s University District Board. 
Anyone who has had the pleasure of know-
ing and working with Elaine, describes her as 
nothing but determined, energetic, approach-
able, and compassionate. In addition to all her 
professional successes, Elaine kept her prior-
ities in life as God, Family, Word. Throughout 
her career she has shown dedication and a 
genuine care for the medical profession and 
those in it. This is exemplified in her willing-
ness to give back to the next generation of 
medical professionals by serving as an adjunct 
professor as Washington State University 
School of Nursing following the completion of 
her own B.S. in 1977 and her M.B.A. in 1994 
from Liberty University. 
Most recently, during the Coronavirus out-
break Elaine has again led with distinction dur-
ing challenging and uncertain times. She 
made it a priority to continuously adapt hos-
pital and clinic operations to meet the emer-
gent and changing needs of patients, frontline 
workers, and the community. 
Madam Speaker, for her commitment to 
health care, her exceptional, engaging manner 
and for her lasting impact on the lives of peo-
ple around her, I recognize Elaine Couture.

RECOGNIZING ARMY VETERAN 
JOHN PAUL CURRAN 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize my constituent, John Paul Curran and 
congratulate him on his 105th birthday. A vet-
eran, family man, Beatles fan, and so much 
more, ‘‘Uncle John’’—as his family lovingly 
calls him—has led a remarkable life. 
John’s story begins on November 11, 1915, 
in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. He spent his 
childhood there, enjoying time with his family, 
attending church, and playing baseball. In 
1933, he graduated from Honesdale Catholic 
High School before he was drafted into the 
Army nine years later. 
On May 18, 1942, John began his service to 
our nation. It was then that he formed his 
fondest memories—serving alongside his fel-
low Americans to serve and protect our coun-
try in World War II. He spent three months in 
basic training in Gadsden, Alabama, before 
working as a Postal Clerk, Grade T/4 in the 
Judge Advocates office, and a Rifleman, 
Grade T/4. As a Postal Clerk, John handled 
and dispatched classified information and in-
spected critical Victory Mail. He served in the 
Rhineland Offensive in Central Europe and 
went on to receive the Good Conduct Medal 
and the American Theater Campaign Medal 
with two Bronze Stars. 
After he was honorably discharged on Janu-
ary 
10, 
1946, 
John 
returned 
home 
to 
Honesdale, where he worked for General 
Electric. John’s entrepreneurial spirit led him 
to San Francisco in the 1950s where he was 
a partner in a small business and managed 
apartment buildings. After falling ill and receiv-
ing lifesaving care at a VA hospital, he moved 
to Palm Desert in 2003, where he now enjoys 
spending time with his grandnephews, family, 
and friends; playing bingo at the Joslyn Cen-
ter; reading and doing crossword puzzles; and 
playing the occasional penny slot machine. 
It is fitting that John shares his birthday with 
Veterans Day, a day devoted to recognizing 
and honoring all those who have sacrificed for 
our nation. 
On behalf of California’s 36th Congressional 
District, Happy Birthday, John. And we thank 
him for his years of service to our nation. As 
he celebrates this momentous occasion, his 
story is now recorded in our nation’s history 
and will live on for generations to come.

REMEMBERING THE HONORABLE 
JAMES R. WILLIAMS 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of James R. Williams, the first 
African American to serve as a Summit Coun-
ty, Ohio Common Pleas judge and a longtime 
Akron civic and civil rights leader, who passed 
away on Friday, November 9, 2020, at the age 
of 88. 
Judge Williams was an Akron Municipal 
Court judge, a member of Akron City Council, 
and in 1978 was appointed by President 
Jimmy Carter as U.S. attorney for the North-
ern District of Ohio. He was appointed to 
Akron Municipal Court in 1983, and then in 
1989 became Summit County’s first Black 
Common Pleas Court judge, subsequently 
twice winning reelection to the bench. 
He was a civil rights leader who was an offi-
cer with the Akron and Ohio NAACP branches 
and other organizations. He was a University 
of Akron alumnus and a former president of 
Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity that, while he was 
a member, pioneered housing for low- to mod-
erate-income residents and seniors. 
Judge Williams was the principal founder 
and first chairman of Alpha Phi Alpha Homes 
Inc., a nonprofit housing, development and 
management corporation formed in 1966 in 
Akron by the Eta Tau Lambda chapter of 
Alpha Phi Alpha. 
James, a native of Columbus, Mississippi, 
moved to Ohio following active service with 
the U.S. Army. He also taught in Akron Public 
Schools and was a senior staff member for 
Akron’s Department of Planning and Urban 
Development. He retired as common pleas 
judge in January 2005, after 15 years on the 
bench. 
Judge Williams was preceded in death by 
his first wife, Catherine. He is survived by his 
wife, Jewell Cardwell-Williams; two children, 
Michael, a former Akron City Council member, 
and Jacqueline Walton; and four grand-
children. 
The Honorable James R. Williams was truly 
a revered figure in Summit County and North-
east Ohio. Anyone who knew Judge Williams 
saw him as a man of deep integrity and a man 
that carried a strong commitment to commu-
nity. I cannot thank James enough for his 
service to our country and his service to Akron 
and Summit County. My deepest condolences 
go out to the Williams family and to all whose 
lives were touched by James.

HONORING DR. EARNEST LEE 
RANKIN, SR. 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Earnest Lee 
Rankin, Sr. who was born in Simpson County, 
Mississippi on March 12, 1947, to Eliza Marie 
Rankin. He was the seventh of eight children. 
Dr. Rankin graduated from Harper High 
School in 1967, in Mendenhall, MS, before at-
tending Prentiss Institute and graduating in 
1969. While at Prentiss Institute, he married 
Dorothy 
Mikell, 
affectionately 
known 
as 
‘‘Doris,’’ on March 2, 1969. Dr. Rankin grad-
uated with a Bachelor’s degree in Biology from 
Tougaloo College in May 1971. 
After attaining the highest score on the 
Medical College Admission Test in the state of 
Mississippi, he was accepted into the third in-
tegrated class of Medicine at the University of 
Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, MS, in 
1971. Dr. Rankin completed a two-year resi-
dency in Family Practice at Texas Tech Uni-
versity in Amarillo, TX, and then decided to re-
turn home to begin practicing medicine, first in 
Madison, Leake & Yazoo Family Health Cen-
ter in Canton, MS, in 1976, and later opening 
a private practice in Family Medicine in Jack-
son, MS, circa 1979. 
An intelligent, compassionate man of hum-
ble beginnings, he believed that everyone 
should be treated like a human being and was 
entitled to receive adequate health care. Dr. 
Rankin provided health care services to count-
less family members, the poor, the underprivi-
leged, and the ‘‘have-nots.’’ finally retiring in 
2019, after 43 years of practice. 
At an early age, Dr. Rankin joined Mount 
Zion Hill Baptist Church in Mendenhall, MS. 
Later in life, under the influence of Bro. Eddie 
Gates, Sr., he accepted Jesus Christ as his 
Lord and Savior. Dr. Rankin was a member of 
Mount Wade Baptist Church under the leader-
ship of the late Rev. Clevie Snell. He was an 
active member of the church for 28 years, 
serving as Sunday school teacher, deacon, 
member of the finance board, and wherever 
else he was needed. 
Dr. Rankin lived a full life as a volunteer in 
the Parchman Penitentiary Prison ministry, an 
avid and competitive bowler, and a great 
huntsman who rarely missed deer hunting 
season (or any other season for that matter). 
Dr. Earnest Rankin, Sr. held a special place in 
his heart for his family. 
Dr. Rankin is survived by his wife, Mrs. 
Dorothy Rankin of Jackson, Mississippi; chil-
dren, Dr. Yolanda A. Rankin, Earnest Rankin, 
Jr., Demetira Rankin, Christa Pittman, and 
Patrick McKinney Rankin. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Dr. Earnest Lee Rankin, Sr.

HONORING THE LIFE OF LT. COL. 
(RET.) DANNY CURTIS 
HON. DAVID LOEBSACK 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. LOEBSACK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of Lt. Col. 
Danny Curtis of Hills, Iowa, who passed away 
on October 24, 2020. Lt Col. Curtis joined the 
Army in 1964, serving one tour in Korea and 
two tours in Vietnam. While in service, he led 
teams to build Blackhawk helicopters, taught 
military science at the University of Notre 
Dame, and received numerous commenda-
tions, including one Legion of Merit, two Dis-
tinguished Flying Crosses, and three Bronze 
Stars. Lt. Col. Curtis is survived by his son, 
Clayton (Laura) Curtis, and two grandchildren, 
Annmarie and Evelyn. He was preceded in 
death by his wife, Judy Slaughter Curtis, 
mother Ester Buline Curtis, father Lloyd Curtis, 
and sister Nina Jean Curtis. 
Danny Curtis did not tend to shine a light on 
his own accomplishments, though numerous 
they were. Instead, he highlighted experiences 
that demonstrated the best of man in com-
radeship. He led by this principle later in life, 
being a steady advocate and friend to fellow 
veterans, and a fixture in his community. 
Known by his friends and family for his wit and 
his ability to weave a story, he will be greatly 
missed. So, on this, the week of Veterans day, 
let us remember his sacrifice, and the sacrifice 
of all the men and women who have served 
in the United States Armed Forces.

TRIBUTE TO VETERANS OF THE 
ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED 
STATES 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to all the men and women 
who have served in the Armed Forces of the 
United States and risked their lives to defend 
our freedoms and way of life and took and 
lived the oath to ‘‘support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic’’ and bore true 
faith and allegiance to the same, an obligation 
they took freely, without any mental reserva-
tion or purpose of evasion. 
Veterans are truly heroes walking among 
us. 
I want to thank all of our armed serviceman 
and women for their selfless dedication to our 
protection every day. 
Veterans Day is a reminder to all of us who 
live in freedom that, as President Kennedy 
said, ‘The price of freedom is high, but Ameri-
cans have always paid it.’’ 
This Veterans Day is a welcome opportunity 
to remember that the fallen who gave the last 
full measure of devotion to their country on 
battlefields around the world—in places whose 
names may be unforgettable—or locations that 
have slipped into the pages of history. 
We will never forget: Revolutionary War— 
Valley Forge, YorkTown; Civil War—The Bat-
tle of Antietam, The Battle of Gettysburg; 
World War I—The Battle of Argonne, Flanders 
Field, Verdun; World War II—Pearl Harbor, 
Battle of Bataan, The Battle of Midway, D- 
Day, Battle of the Bulge, Battle of Anzio, Bat-
tle of Corregidor; Korean War—Inchon, Heart 
Break Ridge, Pork Chop Hill; Vietnam—Tet 
Offensive, Battle of Hue; Desert Storm—Sep-
tember 11, 2001, Pentagon Attack (125 killed); 
Operation 
Enduring 
Freedom—Battle 
of 
Kandahar; Operation Iraqi Freedom—Second 
Battle of Fallujah. 
The memory of the fallen are never forgot-
ten. 
Each Veterans Day, Americans come to-
gether to remember those who have served 
our country around the world in the name of 
freedom and democracy. 
The debt that we owe to them is immeas-
urable. 
Their sacrifices, and those of their families, 
are freedom’s foundation. 
Without the brave efforts of all the soldiers, 
sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guards-
men and women and their families, our coun-
try would not live so freely. 
I offer my deepest gratitude to our nation’s 
troops and reservists, their families, and the 
21.6 million veterans, including 29,126 here in 
the 18th Congressional District. 
21.6 million brave men and women are vet-
erans of our nation’s military service. 
This includes more than 2 million women, 
2.7 million African-American men and women, 
1.5 million Hispanic men and women, 342,000 
Asian-American Pacific Islanders, and 178,000 
American Indians. 
Nine in ten military families believe the pub-
lic does not understand or appreciate their 
sacrifices. 
We use Veterans Day to show our veterans 
and military families how important they are to 
us and how grateful we are for them each and 
everyday. 
November is National Caregivers Month to 
show our caregivers how grateful we are for 
them. 
It is only fitting that we thank those care-
givers who serve our military today. 
5.5 million spouses, parents, children, and 
other loved ones care for our wounded war-
riors and 15 percent of caregivers spend 40+ 
hours a week providing care for our military 
families. 
As a senior member of the House Commit-
tees on Judiciary and Homeland Security, I 
care deeply about our veterans. 
In Congress, I have sponsored many legis-
lative proposals and cosponsored more than 
50 pieces of legislation that will positively ben-
efit our veterans and their families.’’ 
This year, I introduced H.R. 2898, the 
Buddy Check Week, which has been en-
dorsed by the American Legion. 
The American Legion send email urging all 
congressional offices to support veterans by 
cosponsoring H.R. 2898, a bill to direct the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs to designate a 
week as ‘‘Buddy Check Week’’ for the purpose 
of outreach and education concerning peer 
wellness checks for veterans, and for other 
purposes. 
The American Legion was chartered and in-
corporated by Congress in 1919, and today it 
is the nation’s largest wartime veterans serv-
ice organization. 
As we continue to fight the COVID–19 pan-
demic on all fronts, we cannot forget about our 
duty to care for our veterans who have al-
ready sacrificed so much for this country. 
Throughout this epidemic, the feeling of iso-
lation among veterans has only been ampli-
fied, causing an increased risk of suicide with-
in the community. 
CBS News has reported a 20 percent in-
crease in military suicides when compared to 
the same period in 2019. 
A report conducted by the Meadows Mental 
Health Policy Institute found that for every 5 
percent increase in the unemployment rate, 
we could lose an additional 550 veterans to 
suicide annually and up to 20,000 more vet-
erans may be susceptible to substance abuse 
as a result of the crisis. 
Now more than ever, we need the Buddy 
Check Week Act. 
This bill would provide vital support and 
training to organize outreach events and edu-
cate veterans on how to conduct peer 
wellness checks and recognize signs of prob-
lems in fellow veterans that indicate suicide 
risks. 
This legislation is modeled after the Amer-
ican Legion’s ‘‘Buddy Check National Week of 
Calling,’’ held March 11 to 16, 2019, and will 
augment the organization’s efforts to conduct 
outreach to veterans across the nation. 
The Buddy Check Week Act directs the 
Secretary of Veterans Affairs in consultation 
with veterans, non-profits that serve veterans, 
mental health experts, and members of the 
Armed Forces, to develop and implement col-
laborative education opportunities for veterans 
to learn how to conduct wellness checks. 
The VA will provide online or in-person 
training to individuals, as well as provide op-
portunities for Veterans Service Organizations 
(VS0s) to learn how to: train individuals to 
conduct peer wellness checks, transfer phone 
calls to the Veterans Crisis Line, and be resil-
ient when handling a veteran in crisis. 
The Buddy Check Week Act is a fitting way 
to honor our veterans and I look forward to 
working with my colleagues to see that it be-
comes law. 
On the battlefield, the military pledges to 
leave no soldier behind. 
As a nation, let it be our pledge that when 
they return home, we leave no veteran behind. 
This day and every day let us honor their 
service with actions that fulfill our commitment 
to our troops, their families, and our vet-
erans—and that are worthy of our grateful na-
tion.

IN HONOR OF LESTER A. 
BURDETTE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Lester A. Burdette of 
Huntingdon County for his service in the 
United States Army. Lester is an outstanding 
Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for his serv-
ice to our nation, the Commonwealth of Penn-
sylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered 
the call to serve and fight for us—at a great 
cost. Truly, our veterans are the best of Amer-
ica. 
In Congress, it is my privilege—and my re-
sponsibility—to stand up for those who have

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
CONSTANTINE ‘‘BUZZ’’ BELER 
HON. GEORGE HOLDING 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. HOLDING. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life of Constantine ‘‘Buzz’’ Beler, 
who passed away last month at the age of 90. 
For more than half a century, Buzz was a tow-
ering figure in the restaurant industry and a 
beloved pillar of his community. 
The son of Peter and Cleo Hariklea ‘‘Hattie’’ 
Beler, Buzz learned the ropes of the res-
taurant industry at a young age working at his 
parents’ restaurant in Baltimore, Maryland. 
Buzz went on to attend the University of Vir-
ginia where he was a member of the Riding 
team and a standout in the classroom. Fol-
lowing graduation, Buzz returned home to pur-
sue a law degree at the University of Mary-
land. 
Buzz did a brief stint in the Army and then 
spent some time working at a local law firm. 
Ultimately, though, Buzz found himself yearn-
ing to return to the restaurant business. When 
the Horizon House—a little known eatery in 
Baltimore—went up for sale in 1965, Buzz and 
his brother seized the opportunity and opened 
up the ‘‘Prime Rib.’’ 
Their elegant, yet simplistic steakhouse did 
quite well. A decade later the brothers decided

to open a second location in Washington, D.C. 
in 1976. The venture was a smashing suc-
cess. Over the years, the Prime Rib became 
a renowned institution—racking up a long list 
of local and national accolades. 
All the while, Buzz could be found at the 
steakhouse nearly every night of the week— 
where he oversaw operations and spent his 
time chatting up customers. 
Several generations of locals came to ad-
mire Buzz for his strong character, impeccable 
work ethic, and vibrant spirit. Buzz will be re-
membered as a warmhearted, gracious gen-
tleman who rose to prominence and achieved 
success the right way. 
Buzz was a dear friend and I will always 
cherish the memories I have of him. His was 
truly a life well-lived.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF THE BILATERAL RELATION-
SHIP 
BETWEEN 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES AND KAZAKHSTAN 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the importance of the bilat-
eral relationship between the United States 
and Kazakhstan. This has been a key relation-
ship 
for 
the 
United 
States 
ever 
since 
Kazakhstan established its independence al-
most 
30 
years 
ago. 
The 
Republic 
of 
Kazakhstan’s 
first 
president, 
Nursultan 
Nazarbayev, oversaw Kazakhstan’s emer-
gence as the economic leader of Central Asia, 
and the United States’ key ally in the region, 
as evidenced in part by the fact that U.S. com-
panies are the largest source of direct foreign 
investment in Kazakhstan. This is in large part 
due to the fact Kazakhstan has implemented 
reform and liberalization policies that have 
strengthened the bond between our two coun-
tries. 
Similarly, Kazakhstan has embarked on a 
path of political reforms to match its success-
ful economic reforms and is taking an increas-
ingly visible role in global affairs. As Chairman 
of the Helsinki Commission, I must highlight 
the fact that Kazakhstan chaired the Organiza-
tion for Security and Cooperation in Europe in 
2010 and led the U.N. Security Council in 
20I7–2018. In 2018, President Nazarbayev 
visited Washington, D.C., in connection with 
the announcement of an Enhanced Strategic 
Partnership for the 21st Century between 
Kazakhstan and the United States. The coun-
tries agreed to heightened cooperation on po-
litical and security issues, including those re-
lated to Afghanistan and other defense initia-
tives, terrorism, extremism, the rule of law, 
and human rights. 
On November 30th, Kazakhstan’s Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs will be hosting a conference 
to review former President Nazarbayev’s long 
career and highlight his efforts and accom-
plishments in establishing Kazakhstan as a 
global leader in a number of important areas. 
Perhaps most notably is the former president’s 
unbending dedication to advancing the prin-
ciples of nuclear nonproliferation, a stance that 
has made the entire world a safer place for 
this and future generations. 
I also applaud current President Kassym- 
Jomart Tokayev’s efforts to prioritize additional 
political reforms that will increase transparency 
and make the government more responsive to 
all of Kazakhstan’s citizens. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
as 
former 
President 
Nazarbayev celebrates his 80th birthday and 
the people of Kazakhstan approach the cele-
bration of their country’s 30th anniversary, I 
wish all people of Kazakhstan nothing but 
peace, prosperity, and continued blessings.

IN HONOR OF MARGARET G. 
BURGESS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Margaret G. Burgess 
of Huntingdon County for her service in the 
United States Navy. Margaret is an out-
standing Pennsylvanian, and I am grateful for 
her service to our nation, the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, and our community. 
In Pennsylvania and across the country, our 
veterans have served and sacrificed for Ameri-
cans’ freedom and our values. They answered

RECOGNIZING THE CAREER OF 
MAYOR JACKIE A. MECK 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the distinguished career of Buck-
eye, Arizona’s Mayor, Jackie A. Meck, as he 
prepares for a much-deserved retirement. A 
native and lifelong resident of Buckeye, Mayor 
Meck has dedicated his life to public service. 
Buckeye and Maricopa County have been well 
served under his leadership. 
Mayor Meck’s retirement comes as he con-
cludes his third consecutive term as Mayor of 
the City of Buckeye. Three terms is a mere 
drop in the bucket of the lifetime of work he 
has given this great city, as he was previously 
Mayor in 1973 and a two-time member of the 
city council. 
His dedication to the advancement of his 
community runs not just through Buckeye, but 
also into West Valley and all of Arizona. A 
member of the Board of Directors of the 
Greater Phoenix Economic Council, Maricopa 
Association of Governments Regional Council, 
Gila River’s El Rio Restoration Project Execu-
tive Committee, Interstate-1 Coalition, and 
much, much more, Mayor Meck continues to 
be an active member of the governmental and 
non-governmental associations which work for 
the benefit of Buckeye and its surrounding 
areas. 
Mayor Meck exemplifies the fierce patriotism 
and unwavering commitment to country that 
exists in Arizona’s Fourth Congressional Dis-
trict. Under Mayor Meck’s tenure, Buckeye 
has grown stronger and more prosperous. We 
are grateful for his service to Buckeye, Mari-
copa County, and the great state of Arizona. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to 
join me in thanking Mayor Meck for his service 
to Buckeye and in wishing him a very happy 
retirement.

HONORING EDGAR SCULARK 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Edgar Sculark. 
Edgar is the third child to the late L.A. and 
Evie Sculark and was born and raised in 
Parchman, Mississippi. L.A. Sculark was one 
of the first African Americans to be employed 
at the Mississippi Department of Corrections. 
Edgar was the first African-American child 
born to an African-American couple while liv-
ing on the penitentiary property. Edgar was 
educated in the Drew Separate School District 
in Drew, MS, where he was very active in 
sports and band. After graduation, Edgar at-
tended Mississippi Delta Community College 
in Moorhead, Mississippi, where his major was 
Criminal Justice. 
Shortly after the start of his college edu-
cation, Edgar left the classroom to support a 
new family. Edgar married his high school 
sweetheart, Mashelia Kidd, and they now re-
side in Batesville, MS, with their three chil-
dren. His greatest regret was not completing 
his college degree. However, that milestone 
helped to transition his mindset into being a 
big advocate for Education and Living a Pur-
pose Driven Life. Edgar gave service to this 
country, as well as this state; he spent 10 
years in the Mississippi Army National Guard 
and worked 10 years with the Mississippi De-
partment of Corrections. Edgar also had the 
opportunity to cultivate his craft by being a 
master trainer with XPO Logistics. During his 
tenure with XPO Logistics, he started new 
companies and coordinated safety trainings. 
Although he had a flourishing corporate ca-
reer, Edgar felt that he was neglecting his pur-
pose. It was then that he knew something was 
missing and broken. 
Amidst the broken, Edgar always had a de-
sire to build. With those desires came visions 
of operation with his Non-Profit Organization 
(GEM) Greater Expectation Ministries and LLC 
Voice2Vision (2019). Outlined within his orga-
nizations, he ventured into different platforms 
that delegate the spirit of empowerment 
though: Mature Minded Males (MMM), Favor 
Filled Females (FFF), Character Chipped Chil-
dren (CCC), Book & Blazers, Scholars and 
Skirts and The Nehemiah Grind. Edgar’s ulti-
mate goal of servitude, through both organiza-
tions and each platform, is to continue the 
cycle of youth and people empowerment by 
way of Motivational Speaking, Mentoring, Re-
form Misguided Conduct, and Life and Char-
acter Coaching. Edgar’s areas of specialty 
are: Anti-Bullying, Personal Motivation and 
Self-Ownership. 
At this point, Edgar began transitioning into 
another level of building. He reached into the

surrounding communities to build partnerships. 
As an advocate for children and people, Edgar 
wanted to do all he could to assist with in-
creasing community involvement. To that ex-
perience he added training that equipped him 
to adequately assist in every arena of trauma. 
Edgar is a Trained Advocate of the ACES (Ad-
verse Childhood Experiences) Platform. 
Prepped and ready to train and assist, 
Quitman 
County 
became 
his 
stomping 
grounds. Edgar has partnered with The Re-
claim Project (The Village), where he also ac-
tively serves on the board. Being so familiar 
with the children of Quitman County, it was in 
his heart to build a partnership with the 
Quitman County School District, where he ac-
tively participates and trains to better serve 
the needs of the community. He didn’t stop 
there, he built another bridge that crossed into 
the Quitman County Fine Arts Program where 
he actively serves on the Board as well. 
Edgar often states, ‘‘If you get it in your 
head, God will bring it out through your 
hands.’’ So it’s no secret why he serves. His 
purpose, his passion and God’s plan are the 
driving forces behind his Healthy Heart to 
Hand dedication to children, people and com-
munity involvement. To that end, Edgar an-
swered his Pastoral Calling 26 years ago, at 
the age of 21. Still walking in God’s Purpose 
Placed Plan, he has been serving the Quitman 
County Community for 25 years as a Pastor. 
From that day to this, Edgar is the Pastor of 
the Great View Bible Church in Lambert, Mis-
sissippi where he operates in his greatest pas-
sion of Leadership and Servitude. It is with a 
grateful heart that he extends the same grace 
that he has experienced throughout the trials, 
transitions and triumphs of sacrifice. Trusting 
God, Trusting in the process and leaning in 
the way God leads has been the staple of Ed-
gar’s life just as it is stated in Proverbs 3:5– 
6—Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and 
lean not unto thine own understanding. [6] In 
all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall di-
rect thy paths. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Edgar Sculark for his dedi-
cation to serving his community and this great 
state.

RECOGNIZING DR. DAVID READY 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 12, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to recog-
nize my constituent, Palm Springs City Man-
ager Dr. David Ready and congratulate him on 
his retirement after 35 years of work in local 
government. 
For the last 20 years, Dr. Ready has worked 
tirelessly to rebuild Palm Springs’ reputation 
as a world-renowned tourism destination, lead-
ing the city into an unprecedented economic 
renaissance. During his tenure as city man-
ager, Palm Springs’ sales tax revenues have 
increased five times, the city has developed 
50 neighborhood organizations, and the down-
town area has been completely revitalized. 
Beyond managing a city budget of $291 mil-
lion, Dr. Ready has also ensured that Palm 
Springs can provide higher-quality services for 
its residents. Streets and parks are continually 
improving, historic sites are being preserved, 
and Palm Springs continues to house its own 
police department and animal shelter. Further, 
Dr. Ready’s crucial role in developing air serv-
ice has brought in tremendous revenue from 
the Palm Springs Airport. 
Dr. Ready’s leadership has guided Palm 
Springs through some of its toughest times, in-
cluding this year’s pandemic. When facing a 
forecasted decrease in tax revenue this year, 
Dr. Ready worked diligently with the city coun-
cil to turn a projected deficit of $15.5 million 
into a much smaller $1.2 million. The city is 
adapting to COVID–19, and we have Dr. 
Ready’s guidance to thank. 
Dr. Ready is the longest-serving city man-
ager in the Coachella Valley, and the only city 
manager in the United States with both a law 
and doctorate degree. His education has 
served him well and will continue to guide him 
as he pursues public administration academic 
research post-retirement. 
Dr. Ready’s work has truly been tireless, 
and he leaves behind a booming Palm 
Springs that has become revitalized in his 
hands. He says of his work, ‘‘We never lost 
our focus on how to provide the best services 
to our community, how to build our economy, 
how to provide what our community needs.’’ 
This focus has paid off, and Dr. Ready’s leg-
acy will last for generations to come. 
On behalf of California’s 36th Congressional 
District, I thank Dr. Ready for his incredible 
service. I am thrilled to join the City of Palm 
Springs in celebrating his well-deserved retire-
ment.
