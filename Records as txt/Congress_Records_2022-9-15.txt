Holy God, come alongside us this day

goodness and mercy in all we do, in all 
we say, in all our decisions, and in all

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7846 
September 15, 2022 
designated as prisoners of war or miss-
ing in action. On September 16, Na-
tional POW/MIA Recognition Day, we 
recognize their heroism. 
Some of these great Americans are 
honored at memorials like the North-
wood Gratitude and Honor Memorial in 
my home community of Irvine. I have 
proudly voted to invest in the Defense 
POW/MIA Accounting Agency, which 
helps fulfill our Nation’s promise to 
leave no servicemember behind. 
This key agency is responsible for re-
turning the remains of our troops to 
their loved ones and to a grateful Na-
tion. Supporting our Orange County 
veterans and their families is how we 
honor their service. We cannot and will 
not forget our troops’ sacrifices. 
Mr. Speaker, I will continue working 
to protect their legacy. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF LEON WALLACE 
(Ms. MALLIOTAKIS asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of my constituent, Leon Wallace, who 
recently passed away at the age of 85, 
and to share with the Nation his con-
tributions to our community and coun-
try. 
Leon was a native Staten Islander 
who grew up in West Brighton and 
Mariners Harbor, attended P.S. 18, and 
graduated from McKee High School in 
1956. 
Leon enlisted in the U.S. Air Force 
where he served as a jet mechanic 
while stationed in Guam and later re-
turned to service with the Army Na-
tional Guard’s 117th Calvary. He put 
his life on the line for our country at a 
time when our country did not afford 
him equal rights as an African Amer-
ican. That shows you how truly special 
he was. 
Not only was Leon a dedicated mem-
ber of our military but he was a stew-
ard of outstanding service to our com-
munity. After his time in the Air 
Force, Leon dedicated his time to help-
ing individuals with developmental dis-
abilities and their families. He was also 
a member of the NAACP, USIVO, and 
the 369th Veterans Association, as well 
as St. Philips Baptist Church, and re-
cently, even completed the New York 
State chaplains’ course to minister to 
other vets in need. 
To many across our community, he 
was referred to as Uncle Leon. He was 
well-known for his uplifting sayings 
and positive perspective. Whenever you 
asked him how he was doing, he would 
smile and say, ‘‘I am too blessed to be 
stressed.’’ 
I was proud to call Leon a friend. 
This is our last photo together from 
June. I know I speak for so many in 
our community when I say that his 
presence will be missed. 
A WOMAN’S RIGHT TO CHOOSE 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise. I rise today to defend a 
woman’s right to choose. I rise to say 
that I am totally, completely, and ab-
solutely opposed to Senator GRAHAM’s 
bill. 
I rise to say that Senator GRAHAM’s 
bill would deny a woman the right to 
choose, that it is a bill that is antithet-
ical to the best interests of women. 
I stand with the women. I support 
their right to choose. A woman ought 
to have the opportunity to consult 
with those who are closest to her, in-
cluding her physician, to make this 
medical 
decision. 
Senator 
GRAHAM 
would deny this. 
I stand with the women, and I stand 
for a woman’s right to choose. 
f 
THE 80TH ANNIVERSARY OF FORT 
HOOD 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Fort Hood 
on their 80th anniversary marked this 
week. 
Recognized as ‘‘The Great Place,’’ 
Fort Hood has a rich history and is 
composed of great patriots who self-
lessly and honorably serve this coun-
try. 
This largest Active-Duty armored 
post has answered the call to serve 
throughout our country’s military his-
tory and has been an invaluable instal-
lation for Army soldiers, advanced 
weaponry, and the local community. 
Whenever I am asked where the next 
generation of greatness is and leaders 
will be, I say: Go with me. Go to Fort 
Hood. That is where they are. 
Fort Hood is a special part of Texas’ 
25th District, and it is my distinct 
honor to represent them in Congress 
and fight on behalf of the brave sol-
diers and their families each and every 
single day in Washington. 
Congratulations to Fort Hood for 80 
years of exceptional service to the 
United States Army and dedication to 
defending our freedoms at home and 
abroad. 
In God We Trust. 
f 
SUPPORTING WOMEN’S 
REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS 
(Mrs. TRAHAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Mr. Speaker, 81 days. 
That is how long it took for Repub-
licans to change their position from 
abortion as a State issue to supporting 
a nationwide abortion ban; 81 days to 
put their hypocrisy on full display for 
every American—every woman—to see. 
Mr. Speaker, this is what it looks 
like when lawmakers show their true 
intention. Their intention is to go be-
yond the Supreme Court’s disastrous 
decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Their intention is to go beyond the 
horrific State laws that have already 
stripped millions of women and young 
girls of their reproductive rights. Re-
publicans backing this new proposal 
want to ban every woman in America 
from seeking abortion care—no excep-
tions. 
Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker. If Re-
publicans get their way, women’s lives 
will be at risk, and many will die from 
delayed or denied care. 
For our daughters, we cannot—we 
will not—let them win. 
f 
BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to speak to the human tragedy that is 
President Biden’s border crisis. 
From day one, the Biden administra-
tion has blatantly ignored U.S. immi-
gration laws and policies that are de-
signed to keep America safe. The con-
sequences from the human trafficking, 
the sex trafficking, and the drug traf-
ficking are devastating. 
Under the incompetent administra-
tion of Biden and his Border Czar, the 
Vice President, and DHS Secretary 
Mayorkas, savage drug cartels now 
control our U.S. border and are sending 
massive amounts of deadly fentanyl il-
legally into our communities, includ-
ing mine in the Shenandoah Valley of 
Virginia. Worse, they are now smug-
gling rainbow-colored and candy-fla-
vored drugs across our border in an ef-
fort to target our children. 
Biden’s disastrous open border and 
amnesty policies have made this crisis 
worse every single day, but he is blind 
to see the chaos at our border. Ameri-
cans are justifiably outraged by his 
failed leadership. 
Border Czar KAMALA HARRIS recently 
said that the border is secure. The only 
thing that is secure is the cash flow to 
the drug cartels so long as Biden’s bor-
der crisis continues. 
f 
LOWERING HEALTHCARE COSTS 
FOR AMERICANS 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
know the American people are feeling 
the effects of higher prices. That is 
why Congressional Democrats continue 
our work to provide relief to America’s 
working families who are struggling to 
make ends meet by putting people over 
politics and passing the Inflation Re-
duction Act. This historic life-changing 
legislation 
significantly 
lowers 
healthcare costs for America’s seniors 
by enabling Medicare to negotiate pre-
scription drug prices and by capping 
Medicare out-of-pocket expenses to 
$2,000 every year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7847 
September 15, 2022 
The Inflation Reduction Act tackles 
rising costs and inflation by ensuring 
big corporations pay their fair share of 
taxes which will, in turn, reduce the 
national debt. The legislation also 
makes the largest investment ever in 
fighting the climate crisis by investing 
in clean and secure energy production 
and 
manufacturing, 
while 
creating 
good-paying American jobs for the fu-
ture. 
Congressional Republicans are too 
busy trying to score political points 
rather than working with us to solve 
today’s challenges. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to join us in 
working for the people. 
f 
BIDENFLATION IS A TAX ON ALL 
AMERICANS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, inflation is at the highest in 
over 40 years. Yet, by passing the infla-
tion expansion act, Biden and the 
Democrats are further plunging Amer-
ican families into debt and destroying 
jobs. 
Signed into law by President Biden, 
the Congressional Budget Office re-
ports this bill will increase the deficit 
through 2026 and cost working families 
an additional $60 billion. 
Families are paying 14 percent more 
at the grocery store, according to the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics—the largest 
1-year jump since 1979. Eggs are up 40 
percent. Milk is up 17 percent. Bread is 
up 16 percent. 
Since Biden took office, inflation has 
surged 13 percent, while wages have 
only risen 8 percent over the same pe-
riod. The inflation crisis has cost the 
average American worker over $3,000 in 
annual income. 
Bidenflation is a tax on all Ameri-
cans. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
moves from a safe haven in Afghani-
stan to America. 
God bless victory for Ukraine.

RECOGNIZING FRANCES TIAFOE 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, there is al-
ways time to celebrate extraordinary 
Americans, which is why I rise today 
to recognize American tennis star and 
proud son of Maryland’s Fifth District, 
Frances Tiafoe. 
Last week, he became the first Amer-
ican man to reach the U.S. Open 
semifinals since 2006 and the first Afri-
can-American man to do so since Ar-
thur Ashe in 1972. 
Indeed, Tiafoe is one of the only 
three African-American men in the his-
tory of tennis to advance out of the 
rounds and into the finals of the U.S. 
Open. 
Of course, we have been very proud to 
cheer Serena Williams and Sloane Ste-
phens, who together won 4 out of the 
last 10 women’s titles in the U.S. Open, 
not to mention an extraordinary young 
woman, Coco Gauff, who made it to the 
U.S. Open quarterfinals. 
Tiafoe’s 
accomplishments 
in 
the 
men’s tournament are especially im-
pressive, Mr. Speaker, considering his 
extraordinary story. Born in Mary-
land’s Fifth District—mine—to immi-
grant parents who fled civil war in Si-
erra Leone, Frances grew up living in a 
spare office at the Junior Tennis 
Champions Center in College Park, 
Maryland, where his father worked as a 
custodian. Indeed, earlier, his father 
had been part of the construction crew 
that built that tennis center. 
Noticing young Frances’ upbeat atti-
tude and love of the game, the coaches 
and staff of the center took him under 
their wing and helped him train to be-
come one of the most promising Amer-
ican tennis players in recent memory. 
How proud they must be. 
We saw that training bear fruit last 
week when he made it to the semifinals 
by defeating one of the greatest tennis 
players in history, Rafael Nadal, from 
Spain. Although Frances ultimately 
didn’t win the title, he showed the 
world that the future of American ten-
nis is bright indeed. 
I had the opportunity of talking to 
Frances just a few minutes ago. I am 
inviting him down to the Capitol, and I 
want all the Maryland Members to 
meet him. But I am going to invite all 
of you to meet him, as well, Mr. Speak-
er. 
He is an extraordinary young man. I 
congratulate him, I congratulate his 
family, and I congratulate those coach-
es who saw a promising young man and 
took him under their wing not because 
he was paying them but because they 
saw great promise in Frances Tiafoe. 
Boy, were they right. 
f 
HONORING PATRICIA ZAJAC OF 
UTICA, NEW YORK 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Patricia Zajac of Utica, 
New York, who passed away earlier 
this year. 
Patricia was born on February 1, 
1947, and spent her entire life in Utica 
except for a brief period when she at-
tended Golden West Community Col-
lege in California. Upon her return to 
Utica, she worked as a nurse’s aide at 
Faxton Hospital in Utica. 
Affectionately known as the Mayor 
of Frances Street, Patricia was notably 
active in the Utica community. She 
was a graduate of the Utica Police De-
partment’s very first citizen’s police 
academy, was a strong supporter of 
block associations, and was also active 
in local politics and projects that advo-
cated for the betterment of her West 
Utica neighborhood. Patricia was also 
an active parishioner of Holy Trinity 
Church and a vital volunteer with the 
American Red Cross. 
Patricia was also known for her ef-
forts to care for homeless animals and 
pets and her strong support of our Na-
tion’s veterans. She was extremely 
proud of her daughter Mary’s service in 
the United States Air Force. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Patricia so 
much for her lifetime of compassionate 
service to our wonderful community. 
Her memory will live on forever. I ex-
tend 
my 
sincerest 
condolences 
to 
friends, neighbors, and, of course, her 
loving family, whom she left behind. 
f 
RECOGNIZING IMPORTANCE OF 
IAEA 
(Mr. FOSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the importance of 
the International Atomic Energy Agen-
cy, commonly known as the IAEA, and 
to urge Congress to continue its sup-
port so it can continue its mission to 
promote the peaceful use of nuclear en-
ergy. 
The primary task of the IAEA is to 
verify that countries comply with their 
commitments to the Nuclear Non-Pro-
liferation Treaty by monitoring and 
upholding standards for nuclear safety 
and security. 
But it is more than that. Earlier this 
month, we witnessed shelling and dam-
age to the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power 
Station in Ukraine, the largest nuclear 
power plant in Europe. The persistent 
fighting in the area and the occupation 
of the nuclear plant by Russian forces 
have raised concerns about the safety 
and the dangerous conditions that 
plant workers face. 
So, who are you going to call? The 
IAEA. Its response to the situation in 
Ukraine demonstrates the crucial im-
portance of its mission. 
The IAEA stands as a trusted and 
stabilizing influence and reduces the 
danger of potential nuclear disasters 
worldwide.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
DEPUTY JAMES LEE 
(Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend

Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to remember the life of one 
Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office Dep-
uty James Lee, who tragically passed 
away on July 9, leaving behind a legacy 
of service to Jefferson County. 
Deputy Lee was a former marine. 
Maybe I should say is a marine because

uty Lee was one who started with the

Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office in 1973 
and was 71 years old when he passed. 
He was known as someone who en-
joyed going to work to protect his com-
munity and who was tough but always 
showed compassion. He leaves behind a 
wife and a son, who will follow in his 
father’s footsteps at the sheriff’s office. 
Though he may be gone, I know that 
Deputy Lee is still watching over his 
beloved community and family. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing the extraordinary life and serv-
ice of one Deputy James Lee. 
He will be missed. 
f 
DEMOCRATS REIN IN INFLATION 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, for far 
too long, families in my district and 
across the country have struggled with 
rising healthcare and prescription drug 
costs. So, I am pleased to report that 
relief is on the way, thanks to Demo-
crats’ passage of the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act this summer. 
This 
act 
reins 
in 
out-of-control 
healthcare costs and will make a real 
difference in family budgets by extend-
ing tax credits for health insurance, 
capping prescription drug costs for sen-
iors at $2,000 a year, capping insulin 
costs for seniors at $35 a month, and al-
lowing Medicare to negotiate lower 
prices with drug companies. 
A family of four in Ridley Park could 
save more than $2,800 in annual health 
insurance premiums. A senior couple in 
Media could save more than $13,000 in 
yearly healthcare costs. 
If the Inflation Reduction Act’s $35 
insulin copay had been in effect in 2020, 
a 
Springfield 
resident 
who 
uses 
NovoLog could have saved $1,300 a 
year. 
Importantly, all these benefits are 
fully paid for by making the biggest 
corporations and billionaires pay their 
fair share.

REMEMBERING MARY FREEMAN 
KELLER ZERVIGON 
(Mr. CARTER of Louisiana asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
my friend, the dearly departed Mrs. 
Mary Freeman Keller Zervigon, an out-
standing, cherished public servant from 
my home State. 
A 
lifelong 
New 
Orleanian, 
Mrs. 
Zervigon was a policy advocate, philan-
thropist, and beloved civic leader who 
held posts in two mayoral administra-
tions and spent countless hours work-
ing to improve the city of New Orleans 
as a member of many boards and com-
missions. 
She lived her life doing what she be-
lieved in and in doing what was right. 
Raised with civic activism in her 
DNA—her mother played a key role in 
desegregating New Orleans’ public li-
braries—her ability to cut right to the 
chase made her an ideal lobbyist rep-
resenting the city of New Orleans dur-
ing rough legislative sessions. 
She was an incredible lady and an in-
credible leader, one who will be sorely 
missed. 
Rest in peace, my friend. God bless.

petitive service positions from the

the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form or their respective designees.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent that all Members have 5 legis-
lative days in which to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and insert extra-
neous materials on the bill before us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 302, the Preventing a Patronage 
System Act, introduced by Govern-
ment Operations Subcommittee Chair 
Gerry Connolly along with Representa-
tive BRIAN FITZPATRICK. 
This 
straightforward 
bill 
affirms 
Congress’ 
role 
in 
making 
major 
changes to the civil service system and 
ensures that no President can do so 
unilaterally. 
Now, that may sound simple, but this 
is critical to upholding the merit sys-
tem principles that have been in place 
for almost 140 years and fortify the 
civil service of America. 
Career Federal workers serve both 
Democratic and Republican adminis-
trations. They do their jobs guided by 
their expertise and best judgment, not 
by allegiance to any political agenda. 
In 2020, former President Trump 
issued an executive order creating a 
new Federal employee classification in 
the excepted service called schedule F. 
Employees transferred to schedule F 
would have been stripped of workplace 
protections and converted to at-will 
employees. If the order had been fully 
implemented, it could have harmed 
tens of thousands of Federal employ-
ees. 
Agencies were directed to identify 
civil service positions with a policy-
making function to convert to schedule 
F who would be more easily removed 
from their jobs for not rubberstamping 
the President’s political agenda. Pre-
sumably, those positions could then be 
filled with people who would be more 
loyal to the President. 
Fortunately, one of the first things 
that President Biden did upon taking 
office was to revoke the schedule F ex-
ecutive order. But the order still 
shocked the Federal workforce. 
Such an attack against the integrity 
of the civil service should shock us all, 
particularly as Members of Congress. 
We depend on the Federal workforce to 
serve impartially and in accordance 
with the law. Schedule F would have 
instead put immense pressure on Fed-
eral workers to bend to the political 
whims of the President, even if it 
meant violating the law or Federal reg-
ulations. 
But this bill is not just about the 
past. It applies the lessons we learned 
from schedule F to prevent similar ef-
forts to undermine the Federal work-
force in the future, whether from a Re-
publican or Democratic President. 
There are some who are ready and 
waiting to reinstitute a system like 
schedule F if given the opportunity. We 
must prevent that, and we can take a 
big step toward that today by passing 
the Preventing a Patronage System 
Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman 
CONNOLLY for his leadership on this bill 
and for making it a bipartisan bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support it, 
and I reserve the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7849 
September 15, 2022 
b 1230 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is apparently Ground-
hog Day in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Today, just like the last day we de-
bated a bill in the Oversight and Re-
form Committee’s jurisdiction, Ameri-
cans continue to face sky-high infla-
tion, painfully high gas prices, and sup-
ply chain shortages. 
Americans continue to face the con-
sequences of a broken border that 
allow fentanyl shipments to flood in 
and kill our teens, along with a host of 
other urgent problems. They continue 
to look to this Congress for help with 
these real and pressing crises. 
Yet, what are Democrats prioritizing 
instead of addressing these issues dur-
ing one of the last legislative weeks of 
this session? Another bill that insu-
lates Federal bureaucracy from ac-
countability. This time the bill is Rep-
resentative CONNOLLY’s Preventing a 
Patronage System Act. 
This is just another Democrat bill 
that has nothing to do with the Amer-
ican people’s priorities. What is the 
problem the bill tries to address? The 
Democrats’ bill seeks to prevent future 
Presidents making Federal employees 
more accountable to the American peo-
ple whom they serve. 
Our Founding Fathers never envi-
sioned a massive, unelected, unac-
countable Federal Government with 
the power to create policies that im-
pact Americans’ everyday lives. But 
that is currently the state of today’s 
Federal bureaucracy. 
President Trump sought to take on 
this bureaucracy and restore power to 
the people by draining the swamp. He 
issued an executive order in October 
2020 to help make Federal bureaucrats 
who have the ability to create and im-
plement policy more accountable for 
their actions. 
We should all be in favor of policies 
making it easier to remove civil serv-
ants who refuse to follow the will of 
the voters. That is what President 
Trump’s executive order did. 
Democrats are beholden to the Fed-
eral bureaucracy—a workforce who 
thinks they know better than the 
American people. They are wrong. 
Democrats have made every effort to 
preserve bureaucrats’ ability to thwart 
the policies of any President who tries 
to implement policies to reign in the 
expansive influence of the Federal Gov-
ernment over the daily lives of Ameri-
cans. 
This bill is contrary to the American 
way of government—of the people, by 
the people, and for the people. 
The bill’s sponsors allege it is a bill 
that prevents a return to the patronage 
system instituted in the 19th century. 
That is simply not true. President 
Trump never attempted to return to a 
patronage system. Just the opposite. 
Instead of instituting a new patron-
age system, President Trump simply 
made it easier to discipline or remove 
civil service officials in our govern-
ment’s policymaking roles. 
These influential Federal employees 
should not be allowed to chronically 
underperform or actively undermine 
the work of their politically account-
able superiors. 
If you support an efficient and effec-
tive executive branch that is account-
able to the American voters, then you 
must oppose H.R. 302. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume to respond to 
my colleagues who mentioned a prob-
lem with poor performers in the Fed-
eral workforce. Federal managers have 
tools now to remove poor performers 
when appropriate. In fact, over 10,000 
Federal employees were removed last 
year from their jobs for poor perform-
ance. 
This bill does not change the removal 
process for employees who are not per-
forming their jobs well, and schedule F 
was never about removing employees 
who are performing poorly. That policy 
was designed to intimidate and remove 
career employees who dared to provide 
impartial advice that may be perceived 
as contrary to an administration’s po-
litical agenda. Civil servants are sup-
posed to help administrations follow 
the law. 
So let’s set the record straight about 
schedule F. It was intended to punish 
Federal employees doing their jobs 
ethically and legally. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), the chairman of 
the 
Government 
Operations 
Sub-
committee, and the author and sponsor 
of this bill. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my good friend, the chairwoman 
of the full committee, for yielding. 
I have to say, when he cites that our 
Founders never envisioned a large gov-
ernment, that is true—there were 13 
colonies that became 13 States. 
I will remind my friend from Ken-
tucky, neither did they ever envision 
the State of Kentucky. As a matter of 
fact, 
what 
is 
now 
Kentucky 
was 
claimed and owned by my home State, 
Virginia. So there are a lot of things 
that weren’t envisioned back in the 
1780s that we have to deal with in the 
21st century. That is what we are doing 
here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the op-
portunity to discuss and advocate for 
the Preventing Patronage System Act, 
H.R. 302. 
Our Federal workforce—the crown 
jewel of our Federal Government, espe-
cially during a pandemic—is comprised 
of roughly 2 million Federal employees 
hired on the basis of their acumen, 
their skill, and their dedication. They 
work each day for the American peo-
ple—serving in myriad capacities to 
improve the Nation and America’s pos-
ture abroad. 
These impartial civil servants deliver 
mail; provide medical care to veterans; 
help families in the wake of hurricanes 
and deadly fires; design websites that 
facilitate access to lifesaving payments 
like Social Security, unemployment 
insurance, and tax returns; and they 
build telescopes that make us rethink 
what is possible and what kind of uni-
verse there is to be explored. 
This bill, H.R. 302, would ensure that 
Congress controls when and how to 
change the very nature of our invalu-
able civil service. It simply returns 
power to the legislative branch. 
The Preventing Patronage System 
Act would protect merit-system prin-
ciples in our civil service by limiting 
Federal employee reclassifications to 
the five excepted service schedules in 
use prior to fiscal year 2021. It doesn’t 
preclude a President from requesting 
authorization from Congress to create 
a new one, but it requires it. It restores 
the balance. 
Since the creation of the civil service 
in 1883, administrations have estab-
lished an excepted service schedule 
only five times. These excepted service 
categories are created for positions 
that require unique hiring or operating 
rules, such as positions of a short-term 
political nature or positions in remote 
areas, or in instances in which there is 
a critical hiring need. 
On October 21, 2020, then-President 
Trump signed Executive Order No. 
13957 unilaterally attempting to create 
a new one, schedule F, in the excepted 
service. This executive order, accord-
ing to a coalition of good government 
groups—I have got 34 of them endors-
ing this bill—could expose Federal em-
ployees to politically partisan moti-
vated hiring and firing. 
As drafted by that former President, 
schedule F would require agency heads 
to reclassify policy-determining, pol-
icymaking, or policy-advocating posi-
tions to a newly created schedule F. 
This action removes the due process 
rights and civil service protections of 
employees moved into that schedule. 
Despite President Biden’s rescinding 
of the schedule F, Axios recently re-
ported that former President Trump 
continues to develop a unilateral plan 
to seize the reins of Federal Govern-
ment and reclassify up to 50,000 Federal 
civil servants, who are now part of the 
civil service, and they would lose their 
protection and their merit-based pro-
motion. 
Blind loyalty and ideological purity 
tests should never determine who we 
trust with securing our Nation’s bor-
ders, fortifying Federal IT systems, 
caring for seniors and veterans, fight-
ing public health threats, or respond-
ing to natural disasters. 
As one former Federal human re-
source expert said: Do we really think 
a government of political hacks and 
sycophants is in the best interests of 
the American people? Do we think 
making government more partisan will 
make it more trusted by the people?

non-partisan

government . . . would harm the deliv-
ery of crucial services to the American 
people.’’ 
Schedule F is a national security 
issue—and an issue that affects deliv-
ery of essential services and resources 
to every family and every business in 
this country. 
H.R. 302 reinforces the legislative 
prerogative. It requires any attempt to 
create a new excepted service to have 
explicit congressional authorization. 
It is bipartisan and it has 16 cospon-
sors, including three of my friends on 
the other side of the aisle. 
Changing the nature and operations 
of the civil service is rare, important, 
and should require express congres-
sional participation through legisla-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield an addi-
tional 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, Presi-
dent Trump’s schedule F would send 
our Nation back to 1881 when President 
Garfield was shot by a man who be-
lieved the support of the President 
should have earned him a political par-
tisan position in the Federal Govern-
ment. Congress passed the Pendleton 
Act in 1883, 2 years later, to a move 
away from that patronage system, and 
it has been in place ever since. 
As 
President 
Theodore 
Roosevelt 
said, ‘‘The worst enemies of the Repub-
lic 
are 
the 
demagogue 
and 
corruptionist. The spoils-monger and 
spoils-seeker 
invariably 
breed 
the 
bribe-taker and the bribes-giver, the 
embezzler of public funds and the 
corrupter of voters.’’ A good Repub-
lican President. 
Acumen, not political fealty, must 
define our civil service. 
Mr. Speaker, I have so many groups

many Members that have, as well.

Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD two articles: an 
editorial in the Washington Post en-
dorsing this bill and delineating the 
issue, and an article in Newsweek 
doing the same. 
[From the Washington Post, Aug. 29, 2022] 
OPINION: CONGRESS MUST PREVENT ANOTHER 
TRUMPIAN ATTEMPT TO PURGE THE GOVERN-
MENT 
(By the Editorial Board) 
It might sound like an innocuous change 
to the structure of the federal workforce: 
creating a category of employee, known as 
‘‘Schedule F,’’ for positions related to ‘‘pol-
icy-determining, policy-making, or policy- 
advocating.’’ Yet, this change threatens to 
politicize the underappreciated ranks of 
those who keep the country’s government 
running—the nation’s professional civil serv-
ice. 
President 
Donald 
Trump 
created 
the 
Schedule F designation by executive order 
near the end of his term, just ahead of the 
2020 election. The order would have removed 
long-held protections from tens of thousands 
of career bureaucrats, making them easier to 
dismiss. That would give the president vast 
powers to reshape the federal government at 
will—and could politicize positions long 
treated as nonpartisan and merit-based. 
The Trump administration attempted un-
successfully to rush through the change be-
fore the end of its term, and, upon taking of-
fice, President Biden immediately rescinded 
the order. But, according to a troubling re-
cent report from Axios’s Jonathan Swan, Mr. 
Trump and his associates plan to quickly re-
instate Schedule F if he is elected in 2024, 
using it to fire career employees and replace 
them with loyalists. Other potential GOP 
presidential hopefuls have also indicated 
they would consider targeting the federal 
workforce. 
The federal bureaucracy is a behemoth 
that includes approximately 2 million em-
ployees in myriad roles, working to keep the 
government operating. In 2020, the Trump 
administration justified its Schedule F exec-
utive order by suggesting that it would make 
it easier for supervisors to remove poor per-
formers. No doubt there are ways to reform 
evaluation and dismissal processes so they 
are more nimble and responsive. 
But much of our government’s expertise 
rests with civil servants. A system that sees 
more people enter and leave federal agencies 
with the political churn would be less knowl-
edgeable and efficient. It would also elimi-
nate one of the major appeals of federal jobs: 
the understanding that there will be some 
measure of stability even when there are 
changes in administrations. If potential em-
ployees feel like they could be fired with lit-
tle cause or recourse, fewer capable people 
will seek out these positions. That would 
only harm the wide range of government 
services on which Americans rely. 
Democrats 
have 
introduced 
legislation 
that would forestall such a possibility. The 
Preventing a Patronage System Act, spon-
sored by Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D–Va.), 
would block positions from being classified 
outside the existing system unless Congress 
consents to it. Mr. Connolly subsequently 
sponsored this as an amendment to the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act, and it 
passed the House last month. Six Democratic 
senators, led by Sen. Tim Kaine (Va.), have 
introduced companion legislation that would 
do the same thing. These measures would up-
hold protections for federal workers and re-
duce opportunities for patronage-based hir-
ing in the future. 
Populist politicians point to the ‘‘deep 
state’’ as the root of America’s ills. In fact, 
what they cast as a threat—a professional, 
merit-based, experienced civil service—is one 
of the country’s greatest assets.

[From Newsweek, Sept. 13, 2022] 
HOUSE BILL WOULD BLOCK TRUMP PLAN TO 
MAKE IT EASIER TO FIRE FEDERAL WORKERS 
(By Alex J. Rouhandeh) 
The House will vote on a measure this 
week that would ensure the job security of 
thousands of federal employees who pre-
viously faced uncertainty around their em-
ployment security following an executive 
order issued by former President Donald 
Trump. 
Trump issued an order in October 2020, the 
month 
before 
the 
presidential 
election, 
which established a new employment cat-
egory for federal workers called ‘‘Schedule 
F.’’ Under this category, individuals working 
in jobs tied to ‘‘policy-determining, policy- 
making, or policy-advocating’’ would lose 
protections, including due process rights, 
which prevent them from being easily fired 
when a new administration takes office. 
That order effectively eliminated civil 
service employment protection for federal 
employees that had been in place for more 
than 135 years. 
While President Joe Biden revoked the 
order not long after entering the White 
House, there is no law in place preventing a 
future president from executing such an 
order again. 
And Trump has made it clear that if he is 
reelected in 2024, he plans to do just that. 
During a March rally, Trump told sup-
porters that if he were again to serve as 
president he would introduce ‘‘reforms mak-
ing 
every 
executive 
branch 
employee 
fireable,’’ subsequently justifying this action 
by saying, ‘‘the deep state must and will be 
brought to heel.’’ 
‘‘(This would) allow a Trump to put polit-
ical people in those jobs,’’ Democratic Con-
gressman Gerry Connolly of Virginia, who 
has introduced a bill to prevent this execu-
tive order from being reintroduced, told 
Newsweek. 
Axios’ Jonathan Swan reported in July 
that if Trump were to retake office, he plans 
to reintroduce the effort, putting an esti-
mated 50,000 jobs at risk. 
Connolly explained the effect on decision- 
making in the federal government that 
Schedule F would have. 
‘‘All of a sudden now, because the people 
making decisions are avowedly political, 
owing their allegiance not to the Constitu-
tion but to the president who appointed 
them, and they serve at his pleasure or her 
pleasure.’’ he said. ‘‘They can also now look 
at everything through a partisan political 
lens, and that can affect services provided by 
the federal government.’’ 
Connolly represents Virginia’s 11th Con-
gressional District, an area near the Wash-
ington metro area, which houses a large 
number of federal employees. He said he 
interacts with these people regularly, and 
sees them largely as civil servants rather 
than members of a ‘‘deep state’’ that must be 
dismantled. 
‘‘This right-wing mythology that they’ve 
created that there’s this deep state that is 
attempting to thwart the political will of 
our elected political leadership is completely 
false—there is zero evidence of that,’’ Con-
nolly said. ‘‘It’s all a myth created in order 
to expand their partisan political power over 
the civil service.’’ 
Under the Pendleton Civil Service Reform 
Act of 1883, i became unlawful to fire or de-
mote employees for political reasons, ush-
ering in today’s standard, in which positions 
in the federal government are awarded based 
on merit rather than their political affili-
ation. Today, the National Archives writes 
that the act ‘‘applies to most of the 2.9 mil-
lion’’ federal jobs. 
Connelly’s proposed Preventing a Patron-
age System Act, which he first introduced in 
January of 2021, would prevent a president 
from placing employees under a new sched-
ule without the approval of Congress. 
In addition to Connolly, the bill has 16 co- 
sponsors. Three are Republicans, including 
Representative Brian Fitzpatrick of Penn-
sylvania, who served as Connelly’s original 
partner on the effort. 
The passage of this bill could represent a 
significant victory for Connolly, as he looks 
to make a case for why he should fill the 
Democratic party’s top spot on the Oversight 
and Reform Committee once current chair 
Carolyn Maloney leaves Congress at the end 
of this year. 
If Republicans take control of the House, 
the Oversight Committee could become an 
avenue through which the party launches in-
vestigations into President Biden and his ad-
ministration’s top officials, as Minority 
Leader Kevin McCarthy has expressed inter-
est in doing. Connolly would stand at the 
frontlines in opposing this agenda. 
The Virginia Democrat has been a staunch 
critic of the Trump agenda and the former 
president’s role in altering the functioning of 
federal institutions. Connolly served as a 
prominent voice during the 2020 election 
when Democrats raised concerns regarding 
Trump’s choice for Postmaster General 
Louis Dejoy’s running of the United States 
Postal Service. 
In wake of a federal judge calling DeJoy’s 
actions a potential ‘‘politically motivated 
attack on the efficiency of the Postal Serv-
ice,’’ Connolly worked as an original cospon-
sor to help pass the bipartisan Postal Service 
Reform Act of 2022. In the time since, Con-
nolly has continued to go after DeJoy, intro-
ducing legislation to stop him from replac-
ing the postal fleet with gas-powered trucks 
instead of electric ones. 
He likens his work on the DeJoy appoint-
ment to his current work on Schedule F. He 
said both were issues that had not drawn 
public attention. And, as with Schedule F, 
the DeJoy appointment sparked questions 
regarding the politicization of federal gov-
ernment positions long viewed as apolitical. 
‘‘A career civil servant, (former Post-
master General) Meghan Brennan retires, 
and she is replaced by a Republican political 
donor.’’ Connolly said. 
‘‘What we learned during the Trump years 
was that so much of our democracy is based 
on respecting the norms and precedent,’’ 
Connolly added. ‘‘When you get an individual 
like Trump, who couldn’t care less about any 
of that and is not going to respect it, you 
now have to look at codifying into law be-
havior that previously was assumed, and 
Schedule F, this patronage bill, is a good ex-
ample of that.’’ 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume to re-
spond to what my friend, Mr. CON-
NOLLY, just said. This schedule F has 
been grossly mischaracterized by my 
friends on the other side of the aisle. 
I want to relay a scenario. Let’s say, 
Mr. Speaker, that this year were a 
Presidential election year. Let’s say 
that gas prices were an issue in the 
election. One Presidential candidate 
campaigns on: We are going to lower 
the price of gasoline at the pump sig-
nificantly. We are going to lower it to 
the price it was when President Trump 
was in office. The other Presidential 
candidate campaigns, and says: No, we 
are going to convert everything to 
electric vehicles, and everything is 
going to be fine. 
I would say in that scenario the can-
didate who says they are going to 
lower gas prices is going to win over-
whelmingly because this is one of the 
biggest issues in America right now. 
Fast-forward to the administration. 
The President comes in, and he says: 
We are going to lower gas prices be-
cause we are going to issue more per-
mits and we are going to reduce the 
barriers and roadblocks that the pre-
vious administration put in to block 
the American energy companies. He or-
ders that. He has got a mandate from 
the people on that issue. 
The bureaucrats then say: No. No. We 
are not going to issue more permits. 
No. We are going to make it even hard-
er. You can’t frack and you can’t drill. 
I don’t care what the American people 
said at the voting box. I am Mr. Bu-
reaucrat, and no, we are not going to 
do it. 
That is why we need schedule F em-
ployees because the unelected bureau-
crats are not accountable to the Amer-
ican people. We have got a scenario 
here in Washington, D.C. where the 
unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats 
are calling the shots, regardless of the 
will of the American people. That is 
why we support President Trump’s pro-
posal for the schedule F employees. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader of the House of Representatives. 
b 1245 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of this and 
the other two bills that we will vote 
on, the Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee bills that we are considering 
this week. Not only will they make 
government more accountable to the 
people it serves, they are also a testa-
ment to the extraordinary work and 
dedication to service of the commit-
tee’s chairwoman, my friend, CAROLYN 
MALONEY. 
She leaves Congress at the end of this 
year after an accomplishment of three 
decades in office. During that time, she 
has been a champion, not only for New 
York, but for all those across the coun-
try who cherish good government and 
the causes of justice, opportunity, and 
equality for which she has worked so 
very, very hard. 
Few in the history of the Congress 
have worked on behalf of the con-
sumers in a more dedicated and effec-
tive fashion than Chairwoman CAROLYN 
MALONEY. 
Today, she continues that service by 
offering, on behalf of her committee, 
these three bills. I make particular 
mention of the bill authored by Chair-
man GERRY CONNOLLY of the Govern-
ment Operations Subcommittee, which 
has been strongly supported by Chair-
woman MALONEY and their colleagues 
and the committee’s majority. 
I, too, strongly support this effort, 
which would protect the nonpartisan

September 15, 2022 
nature of our civil service by ensuring 
that Presidents cannot simply fire Fed-
eral workers by reclassifying them as 
‘‘schedule F’’ employees. That is what 
the previous President suggested. That 
is what his supporters are suggesting 
now. 
And they are suggesting, not only 
that, but they are going to put people 
in place who want to follow their polit-
ical edicts, legal or not. They made it 
quite clear they want to eliminate 
what they call the deep state. 
The deep state is a cadre of profes-
sionals dedicated to honoring the Con-
stitution, the laws of this country, and 
carrying out the policies of the Con-
gress and the President. 
By the way, it is the Congress that 
makes policy, under the Constitution, 
under Article I. It is the executive that 
carries out policies. Now, Presidents of 
both parties want to be policymakers 
also. I get that. It is a nonpartisan de-
sire of Presidents. 
But our Founders but, more impor-
tantly, those who adopted the Civil 
Service Reform Act and have made 
amendments subsequent to that, and a 
majority of the Congress of the United 
States, both parties, thought that it 
was in the interest of citizens to have 
a professional cadre of employees, not 
subject to political pressure, or whim, 
or edict, but subject to following the 
law and carrying out the policies of 
this country. 
We must guard against a future 
President taking that dangerous step 
of making them employees at will. 
Frankly, we have had a very stark ex-
ample of a President whose will was in-
consistent with American principles. 
We must not return to the kind of pa-
tronage system that fueled corruption 
and partisanship before the civil serv-
ice reforms of the late 19th century. 
The other two bills authored by 
Chairwoman MALONEY are equally nec-
essary and beneficial to the American 
people. The first would further protect 
whistleblowers against retaliation; and 
the second would protect the non-
partisan nature of the U.S. Census, pre-
scribed by our Constitution, and so 
vital to equal representation. 
When we passed whistleblower legis-
lation and protections, we did so be-
cause we wanted people to be able to 
come forward and say the emperor has 
no clothes. The policies being pursued 
are being done inefficiently. The poli-
cies being pursued are wasting money. 
The policies being pursued are illegal. 
That is why we protect whistle-
blowers, because it is in the interest of 
our citizens, of our country, and our 
laws and, by the way, in the interest of 
Congress, so that people can come for-
ward to those of us who make policy, 
who appropriate money, to be told the 
policies that you passed are not being 
followed, or the money you dedicated is 
not being spent in the way you 
purposed it. So these bills are criti-
cally important. 
And by the way, the Constitution 
says, count everybody. That is what 
the Constitution says. The Supreme 
Court said that is what it said. Not just 
my friends; not just the people who 
like me; count everybody. 
And by the way, if you are going to 
change the rules, tell the Congress, and 
tell us before it is too late for us to do 
anything about it. That is all this bill 
says. This bill ought to be overwhelm-
ingly supported by both sides of the 
aisle. 
Very frankly, if you have a deep 
state, you would think you would want 
to make sure that the Congress is the 
one that sets the policies of who is 
counted and not counted and how it is 
counted. 
President Lincoln famously described 
ours as a ‘‘government of the people, 
by the people, and for the people.’’ 
These bills, like the work of Chair-
woman MALONEY, throughout her ca-
reer in public service, will help us keep 
it that way. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to support these bills. 
And in closing, once again, I con-
gratulate CAROLYN
MALONEY
of New 
York for her dedicated, extraordinarily 
effective service to the people of New 
York, people of her city, the people of 
this country. She has been an extraor-
dinary Member of this institution and 
has made us better. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the distinguished majority leader 
quoting the Constitution’s constitu-
tional role of Congress in making pol-
icy. 
I will remind my friend, the majority 
leader, that it is Congress’ role to ap-
propriate money, not the President. 
And that is why we should have over-
sight hearings on the $300 billion stu-
dent loan bailout proposal that the 
President unconstitutionally proposed. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition of H.R. 302, Pre-
venting a Patronage System Act. And 
the reason why I do so is that the 
executive branch needs to function in a 
way that helps the administration, the 
current President of the United States. 
President Trump had an executive 
order to make a section called schedule 
F, where employees could be termi-
nated. This is very important, and the 
reason why I say so is I am also a 
businessowner. And it is very impor-
tant for any businessowner, any CEO, 
anyone running a company, to be able 
to terminate people working under 
them. 
This is an important function of the 
executive branch. Preventing a Patron-
age System Act takes that away. It 
makes it to where they can put people 
into positions where you cannot fire 
them. That is wrong. This is not how 
the government should be working. It 
shouldn’t be putting people in places, 
unelected bureaucrats, into positions 
and jobs where they cannot be termi-
nated. Anyone should be fired. 
You see, there is a reason why the 
American people call Washington D.C. 
the swamp, and it is not just because it 
is built on a swamp. It is called the 
swamp for a reason; because the Amer-
ican people see the government as a 
place where they call swamp creatures; 
they think they never leave. 
In doing so, the Preventing a Patron-
age System Act, this bill will formally 
make it a Federal law in order to just 
make that happen. 
You see, we really need a system in 
place. We need to make sure that we 
don’t pass Federal laws where people 
cannot be fired. It should never be the 
case. 
People should be fired if they are not 
doing a good job. People should be fired 
if they are not doing things effectively 
for the administration they work for. 
The President of the United States 
should be able to fire whoever he or she 
wants. 
The Democrats want to pass this bill 
to empower Democrat operatives; peo-
ple that they have hired; people that 
they have put in their administration; 
they want to make sure those Demo-
crat operatives are there to be able to 
undermine the next Republican Presi-
dent of the United States. That should 
not be a Federal law. 
And as a businessowner, I am telling 
you, it is so important to be able to 
fire people in your company that aren’t 
doing a good job. And it should be no 
different for any President. The execu-
tive branch must be able to have people 
working there that can be terminated. 
Everyone knows the movie ‘‘Pirates 
of the Caribbean.’’ And on the ‘‘Black 
Pearl’’—that is the second one—it has 
pirates on the ship that become part of 
the ship walls. Effectively, that is what 
H.R. 302 is doing. 
The Preventing a Patronage System 
Act will make employees in the execu-
tive branch just that, part of the build-
ing walls, making it impossible to get 
rid of them. 
So, for this reason, I oppose this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to vote 
against it. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
I would like to respond to the gentle-
woman who may not have been here 
when I made my previous remarks, be-
cause I point out that this is not about 
making it hard to remove poor per-
formers. The Federal Government can 
and does remove poor performers where 
appropriate. And there is a process for 
that. 
According to data from the Office of 
Personnel Management, the Federal 
Government removed 10,687 employees 
in Fiscal Year 2021. 
It is in the public’s best interest to 
ensure that the President cannot take 
action that would politicize the civil 
service and threaten the integrity of 
the work that we depend on civil serv-
ants to perform every day. 
One expert on Federal human re-
sources, Jeff Neal, has explained that 
the tension that can exist between ca-
reer employees and political appointees

usually reflects the ‘‘need to ensure 
that proposals are legal’’ and that 
‘‘statutory 
and 
regulatory 
require-
ments, such as the Administrative Pro-
cedure Act, are met.’’ 
In other words, this tension is actu-
ally a sign that the system is working, 
and procedures are being properly fol-
lowed. That is certainly not poor per-
formance or cause for removal. 
Schedule F would have improperly 
targeted those who ensure legality, eq-
uity, and appropriate stewardship of 
taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia (Ms. NORTON), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform and a champion for work-
ers. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend for yielding to me. And 
I appreciate her correction of the prior 
speaker on the other side who repeat-
edly said that Federal employees could 
not be fired, ignoring the figures that 
the Chair had given of 10,000 employees 
fired last year. 
This is a civil service system. It is 
not a private system. It rules under the 
Constitution and under the rule of law. 
That is the difference between working 
for the Federal Government and work-
ing for a private employer. 
I speak in strong support of the Pre-
venting a Patronage System Act—note 
that word—Patronage System Act, of 
which I am a cosponsor. 
This bill would prevent a future 
President from reimposing the sched-
ule F scheme that would move tens of 
thousands of career employees into po-
sitions that would essentially be a new 
form of political appointment. The 
nonpartisan, apolitical civil service 
system is critically important to how 
our government functions. 
President 
Trump 
attempted 
to— 
former President Trump attempted to 
illegally create this new class of Fed-
eral employees, in contravention of the 
Constitution and, more specifically, 
these employees’ rights. 
b 1300 
We need to encourage the best to join 
the Federal Government, and this type 
of ploy by the prior administration 
would hinder that effort; instead, al-
lowing an administration to engage in 
a patronage system. The government 
needs experts, not political cronies. 
I appreciate Congressman CONNOLLY 
for introducing this important bill, and 
I am pleased to be able to speak in sup-
port of it. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. HICE), the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Government Oper-
ations. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. COMER for yielding time. 
The numbers that were just shared 
are out of 2.1 million Federal employ-
ees, and the figure is accurate. Some 
10,000 were terminated in 2021, but this 
is a fraction. People in the private sec-
tor are three times more likely to be 
terminated for poor performance than 
are people in the Federal Government. 
That is because it is so restrictive and 
so difficult to go through the process. 
In fact, when the discussion deals 
with Federal employees that have been 
on the job past the probationary pe-
riod, the number of terminations drops 
to half of what was just spoken of. 
These are skewed numbers that are 
being shared, but also a fraction of the 
over 2 million Federal employees and a 
fraction in comparison to those who 
were terminated in the private sector. 
We must be able to deal with poor 
performers in the Federal Government, 
and our Democrat friends want to pro-
tect them and make Federal bureau-
crats a protected class. That is abso-
lute insanity. It is bad for America. It 
is bad for the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank the gen-
tleman for yielding to me. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume to respond to 
the gentleman’s statement. 
Schedule F was never about remov-
ing employees who were performing 
poorly. That was not the purpose. 
There is already a procedure in place 
for that. 
It aimed to strip workplace protec-
tions away from Federal employees so 
that anyone who didn’t adhere to an 
ideology aligned with the President, 
the former President, could be easily 
replaced with someone who did. 
That is a violation of the impar-
tiality with which the civil service is 
meant to operate. It is supposed to be 
an independent, merit-based system 
not tied to ideology. 
If changes that consequential are to 
be made to the civil service, they 
shouldn’t happen without the approval 
of Congress. That is what this bill does. 
This bill preserves Congress’ authority 
in civil service policy. People can’t 
come in willy-nilly and change the sys-
tem and make it a partisan system 
overnight. 
If implemented, schedule F would 
have placed Federal employees’ careers 
in the hands of political appointees 
who could fire them for presenting 
data, evidence, or views that con-
tradict the political whims of an ad-
ministration. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from the great State of Vir-
ginia (Mr. BEYER), the distinguished 
chairman of the Joint Economic Com-
mittee. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 302, sponsored 
by my friend and colleague from Vir-
ginia. 
Three out of four of my grandparents 
were career Federal servants. I rep-
resent more Federal employees than 
any Member of Congress. I have a deep 
appreciation for the vital work our 
civil service does to keep our Federal 
Government functioning. 
Our Federal employees have endured 
attack after attack from our former 
President and his allies. The most sig-
nificant threat to our Federal workers 
came when the former President tried 
to use executive action to strip Federal 
workers of their most basic protections 
and replace our career civil servants 
with political loyalists. 
This rule would have made a huge 
number of Federal employees fireable 
by any future President, overturning a 
century-old system put in place by 
Congress to prevent this politicization. 
Congress passed the Pendleton Act 
139 years ago, through Democrats and 
Republican Presidents all those years, 
to require civil servants to be politi-
cally independent. We insist our public 
servants be loyal to our country, not to 
our political leaders. We demand integ-
rity, competence, and experience, not 
partisanship and ideology. 
Should schedule F ever be enacted, 
any future President could unilaterally 
transform a whole government over-
night in wildly destructive ways. 
The bill we are about to vote on will 
prevent something like schedule F 
from ever becoming law. It would block 
any reclassifications of Federal em-
ployees to schedule F and prevent any 
position in the competitive service 
from being reclassified to an excepted 
service position. 
This bill is essential to keep Federal 
employees from being used as political 
bargaining chips and protects the ca-
reers of thousands of civil servants and 
their families, along with the legit-
imacy of the institutions under which 
they serve. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
my 
colleagues 
talking 
about 
the 
politicization of how we deal with Fed-
eral employees. The fact is, the bu-
reaucracy has never been more politi-
cized than it is today. 
This bill is the Federal bureaucrat 
protection act. That is what this is. 
Let’s be a hundred percent clear. This 
is about leftists in this body wanting 
to protect the entrenched leftists in 
the bureaucracy, undermining the will 
of the American people every single 
day. That is what it is about. 
We don’t want to allow the people 
who are running the agencies to go in 
and fire people who are either not 
doing their job, completely violating 
their ethics at the desk, or, frankly, 
are going right against the law or the 
will of the American people. 
Look no further than the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, which is 
turning a blind eye to our border. Look 
no further than an FBI that is tar-
geting parents for daring to challenge 
school boards. That is what your Fed-
eral bureaucracy is doing. 
All of these charges being levied, say-
ing, oh, this is about hate, going after 
Federal employees—I am a former Fed-
eral prosecutor and worked with the 
Department of Justice. My father 
worked in the Federal Government for 
20 years right here. But I know why the

September 15, 2022 
gentleman, my friend, Mr. BEYER, was 
here: Because the richest counties in 
America are right here in Fairfax, 
Loudoun County, Montgomery County, 
feeding right off of the back of the 
beast that is the Federal Government, 
the bureaucrats that are stepping over 
the will of the American people. 
If we dare put forward legislation, 
like I have, to say that those bureau-
crats should be able to be fired at 
will—for example, how about the HUD 
employee caught using his work email 
for private business deals, the postal 
employee arrested for bringing cocaine 
into the workplace, and the EPA em-
ployee who spent years viewing pornog-
raphy for 2 to 6 hours a workday? 
The fact is, only 25 percent of Federal 
supervisors felt they could successfully 
remove an employee, while 78 percent 
reported that previous efforts to re-
move an employee had no effect. Only 
3 percent of whistleblower complaints 
are substantiated. Mr. Speaker, 175 of 
16,000 discrimination complaints were 
substantiated in 2019. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle want to preserve an en-
trenched bureaucracy to step over the 
will of the people so that this town can 
decide the well-being of the American 
people. That is what it is about. 
It is about power. It is about the en-
trenchment of power among bureau-
crats. My colleagues know it, and that 
is why they are trying to advance this 
legislation. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I refer to my prior 
statements and reiterate that schedule 
F was never about removing employees 
who are performing poorly. There is a 
whole process to do that. 
This is about protecting the integrity 
of a merit-based system, so people are 
not retaliated against and fired be-
cause they are not doing what some-
body is dictating them to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), the 
distinguished 
Representative 
and 
chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations of the Fi-
nancial Services Committee. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding 
time, and I say to the gentlewoman 
that it has been a preeminent privilege 
to serve with her for lo these many 
years; indeed, superlative pleasure. I 
miss you already. Thank you for what 
you are doing. 
I am grateful to my colleague, Chair-
man CONNOLLY. I see this as another 
example of his legislative brilliance: to 
make a decision that will allow people 
to succeed on their merits or fail on 
their demerits, to take the political pa-
tronage out of the civil service system. 
The civil service system functions ef-
ficaciously 
across 
the 
length 
and 
breadth of this country. Police depart-
ments and fire departments across the 
country that have civil servants pro-
vide the institutional knowledge. They 
have the expertise. Mr. Speaker, you 
don’t want to just throw out all the 
best of the best that have been working 
there and understand what the system 
is all about. 
Every new person who comes in 
would like to bring in people to support 
his or her political philosophy. I sup-
port your having people to work with 
you, but I don’t support destroying a 
system that allows us to have the in-
stitutional knowledge to keep the gov-
ernment functioning efficaciously. 
This patronage system that has de-
veloped under F has been a failure, and 
it is little more than fatuous folly that 
will prove to be harmful to this coun-
try. 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 302, and I 
beg that my colleagues would do so, as 
well. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
The U.S. House of Representatives 
needs to concentrate its energy on 
helping Americans survive economic 
turmoil and defending our borders and 
national security. 
I once again urge House Democrats 
to get back to what the American peo-
ple elected us to do: conduct oversight 
over the Federal Government and the 
Biden administration, which is on a 
path to destroy America. 
We need to hold hearings, conduct 
oversight, and pass legislation affect-
ing the crises that every American is 
facing today. That is our constitu-
tional 
responsibility. 
But 
instead, 
today, we are once again spending val-
uable resources and time on divisive 
political messaging legislation. 
I think if any American was watch-
ing this committee hearing today, they 
would share the frustration of those of 
us on this side of the aisle who are try-
ing to drain the swamp, who are trying 
to 
hold 
unelectable, 
unaccountable 
Federal bureaucrats who refuse to do 
their jobs accountable. That is part of 
the job of Congress. 
This bureaucracy gets bigger every 
Congress. I have noticed, with the ex-
ception of one speaker, all the speakers 
on the other side of the aisle who spoke 
in favor of this bill represent the Wash-
ington, D.C. Federal bureaucracy work-
force. 
The majority of Congress, we rep-
resent America, and America wants to 
hold poor-performing government em-
ployees, bureaucrats, who are paid with 
their hard-earned tax dollars, account-
able. That is why the Republicans op-
pose this legislation, and I urge all of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle to do the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the 
balance of my time, and I will respond 
to my very good friend, who I have tre-
mendous respect for. 
I do not represent the Washington 
workforce. I represent New York City. 
I represent the private sector, the pri-
vate-sector capital of the world, New 
York City, Manhattan. That is who I 
represent. 
I also represent taxpayers, a lot of 
them, and they want their money to be 
spent for good government. They want 
the people working in the government 
to be impartial and dedicated to doing 
the best job possible without political 
influence. That is exactly what this 
bill we are talking about today is 
about. 
Schedule F, as I repeat, was never 
about removing employees who were 
performing poorly. We have a whole 
system to do that. We removed over 
10,000 last year. This is about pro-
tecting employees who are doing a 
good job from political influence. 
I reiterate the crucial role of the peo-
ple who make up the professional and 
nonpolitical civil service in delivering 
government services to our constitu-
ents, protecting our democracy, and 
carrying out agency missions across 
the Federal Government. 
Injecting undue political influence 
into that system, as schedule F would 
have done, would be disastrous for the 
merit system we have in place. 
b 1315 
When we pass this bill today, we are 
making sure that no President of ei-
ther party, Democrat or Republican, 
can ever unilaterally take such de-
structive action in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support a 
merit system, to support the civil serv-
ice system that has served us so well, 
to vote to keep politics out of the civil 
service system, and to support the im-
portant underlying bill. 
I congratulate my colleague and very 
good friend, Mr. CONNOLLY, on his ex-
cellent work on this bill. It is bipar-
tisan. We have three Republicans. But 
I hope that we will pick up more, be-
cause this is about voting for freedom, 
democracy, independence, good govern-
ment, you name it. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support this 
important bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). All time for debate has ex-
pired. 
The further amendment printed in 
part A of House Report 117–464 may be

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1339, the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Georgia. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Let me begin by stating clearly that 
I oppose the underlying bill here. Some 
of my Democratic colleagues claim 
that there is no such thing as a deep 
state, that there are no problems that 
we have within our Federal employee 
system. But there are genuine, valid 
concerns. 
Take, for example, a Washington 
Post story titled: ‘‘Resistance from 
within: Federal workers push back 
against Trump.’’ In that article: ‘‘Fed-
eral workers are in regular consulta-
tion with recently departed Obama-era 
political appointees about what they 
can do to push back against the new 
President’s initiatives.’’ 
We have a problem, and it is a prob-
lem that bureaucrats do not do their 
jobs in fulfilling the will of a duly- 
elected President and the will of the 
American people. Instead, over and 
over, as time has shown it, they resist 
the will of the President. 
This whole title here of H.R. 302, 
‘‘Preventing a Patronage System Act,’’ 
a patronage system is designed to get 
people in the front door. That is not 
even what we are talking about. We are 
talking about people who are already 
in the door who are not doing their job. 
For crying out loud, it is the back door 
that needs to be dealt with, when you 
have poor performers, people who are 
not doing their job. 
President Trump dealt with this by 
instituting schedule F, giving him the 
authority to do away with policy-
makers who refused to do their job. 
That is something that is desperately 
needed, and that is what is at stake. It 
is that issue that my amendment ad-
dresses. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the amendment offered by my good 
friend, Representative HICE. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 302 preserves 
congressional authority to make sure 
that no President can establish a de-
structive policy like schedule F in the 
future without the approval of Con-
gress. 
The amendment would do the exact 
opposite. It opens the door for an ad-
ministration to implement the revoked 
schedule F executive order and dan-
gerously politicize the Federal work-
force. 
For all the reasons this was bad pol-
icy in 2020, it remains bad policy today. 
Schedule 
F 
evaded 
congressional 
oversight in an attempt to make the 
civil service an instrument of partisan 
politics rather than the nonpartisan 
professional, 
independent 
workforce 
that Congress intended it to be. 
Schedule F would replace a profes-
sional system with a patronage system, 
discouraging civil service employees 
from providing impartial advice based 
on the facts or reporting waste, fraud, 
and abuse. 
Reviving this attack on Federal em-
ployees also makes it harder to retain 
and hire qualified employees, which 
further erodes the ability of the agen-
cies to carry out their mission. 
I strongly oppose this amendment, 
and I urge Members on both sides of 
the aisle to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER), the ranking 
member of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this 
commonsense amendment offered by 
my friend, Representative HICE. 
President Trump took needed steps 
to ensure civil servants serve the 
American people, not their own inter-
ests. One of President Biden’s first ac-
tions was to undo these needed re-
forms. 
Representative CONNOLLY introduced 
this bill, even before President Biden 
was sworn in, to overturn President 
Trump’s action and to prevent any fu-
ture President from reinstating them. 
Obviously, the Biden administration 
has a radically different view of the 
Federal 
workforce 
than 
President 
Trump did, one that House Republicans 
strongly disagree with. 
This amendment would simply en-
sure that a future President could rein-
state a policy similar to schedule F to 
allow for more accountability within 
the career civil service. We should not 
tie the hands of a future duly-elected 
President to implement the clear man-
dates of the American people. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), the chairman of the Sub-
committee on Government Operations, 
and the sponsor and author of this bill, 
H.R. 302. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, the chairwoman of 
the committee, for yielding. 
I must say, the innuendos, the nega-
tive characterization, the smears, if 
not slanders, launched against Federal 
employees in general on the floor today 
would come as news, unwelcome news, 
to the almost quarter of a million Fed-
eral employees in Kentucky, Georgia, 
and Texas. Almost 10 percent of the en-
tire Federal workforce live in those 
three States. 
The amendment just offered is a di-
rect assault on our Federal workforce 
and would completely gut the bill in 
front of us. It grew from the Trump ad-
ministration’s efforts to turn our ex-
pert civil service into a collection of 
cronies. This amendment invites the 
crony clown car into the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
My concern is not hypothetical. In 
September 
of 
2019, 
then-President 
Trump circled areas of Alabama with a 
Sharpie that he claimed were dan-
gerously in the path of a hurricane, 
Hurricane Dorian. That prognostica-
tion was contrary to what expert civil 
servants, not swamp creatures, at the 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad-
ministration found. Luckily, the civil 
servants in NOAA’s Birmingham, Ala-
bama, office tweeted out Mr. Trump’s 
error. 
While ‘‘#Sharpiegate’’ made a funny 
hashtag on Twitter, the aftermath 
could have been catastrophic and cost 
lives. 
What if FEMA deployed in the wrong 
region? What if millions of taxpayer 
dollars had been wasted, sending Fed-
eral help where it was not needed? 
What if families in the storm’s path 
were left stranded because our Federal 
workforce kowtowed to the permanent 
marker whims of the then-President. 
I am not the only one sounding this 
alarm. Thirty-four professional asso-
ciations, good government organiza-
tions, think tanks, and nonprofits, 
have endorsed this bill. 
From the International Federation of 
Professional and Technical Engineers, 
hardly a politicized group: 
The impact of schedule F and any similar 
effort to inject political patronage, cro-
nyism, and corruption into the Federal Gov-
ernment would not only be felt by Federal 
employees; it would harm working people, 
our economy, the public interest, and the le-
gitimacy of our democracy. 
From the National Association of 
United States Attorneys: 
If a President can unilaterally reclassify 
employees and strip them of their protec-
tions, there is no longer a safeguard against 
political interference. This is not the system 
of justice our Nation should support. 
From the National Federation of 
Federal Employees: 
Political operatives or ordinary criminals 
will be able to threaten the careers of Fed-
eral workers with impunity, jeopardizing the 
collective mission of the United States. This 
includes employees in Federal law enforce-
ment, national security, and national de-
fense, among others. 
Hardly swamp creatures. 
From the Nonpartisan Partnership 
for Public Service: 
Endangering the skilled employees at the 
core of our government would not only fur-
ther erode the critically low levels of trust

in government but would harm the delivery 
of crucial services to the American people, 
especially in a pandemic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman from New 
York has expired. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I respect greatly the gentleman from 
Virginia and enjoy working with him, 
but his characterization that we are at-
tacking Federal employees is just not 
true. 
There are millions of great Federal 
employees, and those who are doing 
their job have absolutely nothing to 
worry about. That is not what we are 
addressing here. We are addressing 
those who refuse to do their job. 
There needs to be a means of dealing 
with those—especially in this schedule 
F that President Trump put in place— 
those who are responsible for policy-
making, to do the will of the elected 
President of the United States. My 
Democrat colleagues are trying to pro-
tect those individuals and enable them, 
give them the right to continue to 
force their will upon the American peo-
ple rather than the will of the Amer-
ican people as expressed through the 
duly-elected President, whomever that 
may be. This is absolutely wrong and 
beyond my comprehension. 
Even Federal employees themselves, 
year after year after year, talk about 
how difficult it is to get rid of poor per-
formers in the Federal workforce. Here 
we are trying to protect them rather 
than have the ability to deal with and 
terminate poor performers and, specifi-
cally with schedule F, those who are 
responsible, regardless of the adminis-
tration, to perform the will of that ad-
ministration. 
My 
amendment 
addresses 
these 
issues. I strongly urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to support 
this amendment, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1339, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on

The yeas and nays were ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 15- 
minute vote on the amendment offered

Motion to recommit, if offered; and

CELEBRATING 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
WOMEN’S 
SOFTBALL 
TEAM VICTORY 
(Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, it is my great pleas-
ure to announce to our colleagues in 
the United States House of Representa-
tives that the Congressional Women’s 
Softball Team last night snapped a 7- 
year dry spell and beat the press team, 
the Bad News Babes, 6–5. I am surprised 
that they are not here to participate in 
this exuberance. 
It has been 7 long years in the wilder-
ness, and we are so proud to stand be-
fore you and tell you a couple of impor-
tant things. One is that our greatest 
source of pride is that this team is bi-
partisan. 
Madam Speaker, the greatest source 
of pride for us as a team is that this 
team is bipartisan. Ever since our in-
ception 
in 
2009, 
the 
Congressional 
Women’s Softball Team has played 
across the aisle, in both Houses, and 
really tried to set an example every 
day of how we can come together, leave 
our differences off the field, and make 
sure that we can come together for a 
common purpose, and that is fighting 
breast cancer and making sure that we 
can raise awareness about breast can-
cer in young women; and, also, to make 
sure that we can demonstrate that 
coming together can help build rela-
tionships and foster collaboration once 
we leave the field and the game is over. 
Most importantly, I am so proud to 
tell you that our charity, the Young 
Survival Coalition, which is a young 
women’s breast cancer organization 
that helps young women deal with the 
unique challenges that we face when 
diagnosed with breast cancer, we have 
raised, in the last 14 years, $2.6 million 
for the Young Survival Coalition and, 
last night, raised a record, more than 
$530,000 for YSC. 
Very briefly, because I know we are 
all in a hurry, without the leadership 
and dedication of our board of direc-
tors, led by Atalie Ebersole, who is our 
intrepid committee chair, year in year 
and out, she just does an amazing job 
with the whole organizing committee, 
and also—I am annoying. I am going to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7858 
September 15, 2022 
embarrass 
you—Natalie 
Buchanan 
Joyce, please join us. Coach Nat, you 
have got to come up here. Tori Barnes, 
Coach Natalie, Coach ED, they are— 
and Jim Kiley—they are the glue that 
help make sure that we know what we 
are doing and that we can come to-
gether as a team every single year. So 
thank you. 
And then lastly, I acknowledge both 
ED PERLMUTTER and CHERI BUSTOS. We 
occasionally have retirements amongst 
our colleagues. This year, we are losing 
two of our really dear colleagues who 
have been with us since the beginning 
of their time in Congress, and we ap-
preciate their efforts so much. 
And really, lastly, before I turn it 
over to Congresswoman BICE, for those 
of you that have not met me or have 
not heard my story, I won’t make it 
lengthy, but I was diagnosed with 
breast cancer almost 15 years ago, 
when I was 41 years old. 
One day I was the picture of health. 
The next day, after doing a self-exam 
in the shower, I found a lump and, a 
few days later, realized it was breast 
cancer; and that I had the genetic mu-
tation, BRCA2, which made me five 
times more likely of getting breast 
cancer. 
I didn’t know I was at that kind of 
risk as an Ashkenazi Jewish woman. 
And if I didn’t know, as involved as I 
had been in the fight against breast 
cancer, then I realized, my gosh, how 
many women don’t know. 
So thank you to these incredible 
women who help us raise awareness 
about our Capitol Hill family. Think 
about all the young woman that work 
in this process; and that we can make 
sure, pay attention to their breast 
health; know what is normal for them 
so they know when something feels dif-
ferent. And when you catch breast can-
cer early, you are so much more likely 
to survive it. 
So thank you to my colleagues. Go 
Congress. We beat the press. We are 
beating cancer. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, last night I had the honor of 
being one of the co-captains for the 
Congressional Women’s Softball Game 
which, for the first time since 2015, we 
beat the press. 
As was mentioned, this game is vital 
in raising awareness for the Young 
Survival Coalition, and for women who 
face the challenges of breast cancer. 
I again thank Natalie, Tori, Jim, and 
Atalie, and everyone else on the orga-
nizing committee, as well as the spon-
sors that made the game possible. 
But lastly, I especially thank Coach 
PERLMUTTER. This team—where is ED? 
There you are. This team would not 
have gotten the win without you, and 
you, my friend, will be missed. 
It is always a good day when the 
Members of Congress get a victory over 
the press. And if they say they won, it 
is fake news. 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, go Congress. Beat the 
press again next year.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 8824 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask that Representative FITZPATRICK 
be removed as cosponsor from H.R. 
8824. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CARTER of Louisiana). 
There was no objection. 
b 1545 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise for 
the purpose of inquiring of the major-
ity leader the schedule for next week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), who is my 
friend and the majority leader of the 
House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House 
will meet at 12 p.m. for morning hour 
and 2 p.m. for legislative business, and 
votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning 
hour and 12 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for legislative business. 
Next week, Mr. Speaker, the House 
will consider S. 1098, the Joint Consoli-
dation Loan Separation Act, bipartisan 
legislation sponsored by Representa-
tive DAVID PRICE and Senator MARK 
WARNER to provide relief to borrowers 
who need to separate their joint con-
solidation student loans. This legisla-
tion would greatly benefit the indi-
vidual borrowers who are most in need 
of relief, including victims of abuse. 
The House may also consider a con-
tinuing resolution. As all of us know, 
on September 30, at midnight, the gov-
ernment’s ability to fund and operate 
goes out of authorization; therefore, it 
is necessary for us to take action be-
fore September 30, and we may do that 
next week. 
The House may also consider legisla-
tion to reform the Electoral Count Act 
from Representatives ZOE LOFGREN and 
LIZ CHENEY. 
The House will consider bills under 
suspension of the rules. The complete 
list of suspension bills will be an-
nounced by the close of business to-
morrow. 
As is usual, as we come very close to 
ending and then have a substantial pe-
riod of time, October and the first and 
second week in November for the elec-
tion, it is common that we may have 
other pieces of legislation, Mr. Speak-
er, available and necessary to pass. We 
will notify Members as soon as we have 
that information. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Mr. SCALISE. As it relates to the 
continuing resolution that I know the 
gentleman said may come up, we 
haven’t had any details that have been 
shown to us on what that might look 
like in terms of other items in addition 
to some kind of short-term or even 
what the duration of a short term 
would be. 
If there are any dates that the major-
ity has already started thinking about 
that would be included in a continuing

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7863 
September 15, 2022 
resolution, 
any 
extraneous 
items— 
there is some other funding that has 
been thrown about. There has been 
talk about Senator MANCHIN, that 
there may be some agreement that 
Senator MANCHIN
would have some 
kind of permitting reform. I am not 
sure if that would be a part of a con-
tinuing resolution or a stand-alone bill. 
If the gentleman could provide any 
clarification on any of those items that 
we haven’t been privy to in conversa-
tions, I yield to my friend. 
Mr. HOYER. Obviously, that is a 
good question and a good thing to 
have. 
The 
appropriators 
are 
working 
through the administration’s list of 
anomalies, which I know there are 
three or four items dealing with health 
and also dealing with Ukraine and a 
couple of other matters. I don’t have 
that list in front of me, but the answer 
to my friend’s question is that they are 
trying to get that together. 
I think they are pretty close. I will 
talk to Chair DELAURO. I presume she 
is in conversation with and discussions 
with the ranking member, as well, but 
I am sure that that is the case. 
There is also, I believe, money also 
being asked for for disaster relief that 
may well be in the CR. 
The gentleman referred to the discus-
sions that occurred in the Senate be-
tween Senator MANCHIN and Majority 
Leader SCHUMER. Obviously, we are 
going to see what the Senate does. I 
don’t know what the Senate is going to 
do. It is one of the reasons there has 
been a discussion about the Senate 
moving first on that and discussions 
with the Senator about when they were 
going to move. I think that is under 
discussion. 
Mr. SCALISE. Obviously, we will be 
staying in touch on that. Hopefully, 
Ms. LOFGREN will have some conversa-
tions with Ms. GRANGER about details 
because we haven’t seen those yet. We 
surely would like to be more involved 
in those discussions. 
Mr. HOYER. If I might add, I want to 
make the gentleman aware—and I 
know he is—but I want to make the 
Members aware that we will need to be 
here for such time as it takes us to 
pass the continuing resolution so that 
government will continue to operate. It 
is essential for the economy, essential 
for our national security, and essential 
for the employees, but it is also essen-
tial for all those whom they serve on a 
daily basis. 
I have told my Members in some dis-
cussions about what we are going to do 
the last week in September. I have told 
my Members, and we also would make 
clear to all of our Members, including 
the Members on my friend’s side of the 
aisle, that they ought to be making 
sure that the last 3 weekdays of No-
vember and that Saturday they ought 
to keep clear so that if, in fact, we need 
to work during those periods of times— 
and my expectation is we are going to 
have to—that they not be canceling 
events that they scheduled. So, being 
on notice, I think, will be fair to them 
and fair to anybody that we are sched-
uling with. 
Mr. SCALISE. As we are more in the 
first half of September, obviously, this 
would all be at the very end of Sep-
tember. Hopefully, we wouldn’t wait 
until the midnight hour. We are all 
aware of the deadline. 
Hopefully, we can get something 
brought, ideally agreed upon by both 
sides, which we are nowhere near right 
now, but at least to have more direct 
conversations well in advance of the 
deadline, so we are not here watching 
the clock strike midnight wondering. 
Mr. HOYER. I could not agree with 
the gentleman more. I think I am prob-
ably just as frustrated. 
I know the members of the Appro-
priations Committee are as frustrated 
as anybody in this institution. As 
someone who served on the Appropria-
tions Committee for 23 years, we ought 
to be passing bills in a timely fashion. 
We ought to be passing them one at a 
time. We ought not to have these gi-
gantic omnibuses that nobody knows 
about. 
Both sides have had to prepare two 
omnibuses at the end of the year to 
fund government because we haven’t 
passed individual appropriation bills in 
a timely fashion either through the 
House or the Senate or through the 
House and the Senate to the President. 
So, I agree with the gentleman en-
tirely. 
I agree also that we ought to give ev-
erybody as much notice as we possibly 
can. I will tell the gentleman, frankly, 
I was hopeful that we would have 
passed the CR this week. For reasons 
that are, I think, obvious to everybody, 
we haven’t done that. But I am hopeful 
that we can do it sooner rather than 
later and don’t have some September 30 
crisis that we seem to always create. 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. SCALISE. Hopefully, we can 
start seeing actual language next week 
so we can either get to a place where 
we are in agreement or try to resolve 
those areas of disagreement. 
As the gentleman was talking about 
the calendar and other items that may 
be coming up, I noticed there were no 
conversations about any of the legisla-
tion that we have been talking about 
bringing to the floor to address infla-
tion. 
We just saw Tuesday, as the Presi-
dent was holding a party at the White 
House to celebrate inflation, we saw, 
yet again, more devastating news on 
the inflation front, to the point where 
the markets tanked during that party 
at the White House. 
We have a package of bills that would 
help bring down inflation, bring down 
energy costs, and help those families 
who are struggling as we get ready to 
face another cold winter. There are ex-
pectations right now by all the experts 
that energy costs will go up again be-
cause we have limited supply here in 
the country. 
As we identify those bills and yet not 
see any of them being listed for debate 
on the House floor, can we try to get 
some kind of direction on whether this 
majority will work with us to bring 
bills to the floor to address these real 
problems that are hurting families all 
across the country? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I, obviously, anticipated that ques-
tion. I thought about it, and I want to 
say to the Members my thoughts that 
I, frankly, talk about all over the coun-
try. 
We passed a number of bills. Inflation 
is hurting our people. Inflation was not 
caused by President Biden or this Con-
gress. Inflation was caused by the pan-
demic. 
Inflation hurt businesses severely 
and hurt employees severely. In a bi-
partisan way, we voted as that pan-
demic started. As we saw the broad im-
pacts of that, we, in a bipartisan fash-
ion, stepped in to help. It made a very 
big difference. 
I start that way because the rep-
resentation of some is that somehow 
we, by passing legislation, have caused 
this inflation. The OECD nations, the 
economically developed countries of 
the world, have all had inflation. As a 
matter of fact, the average OECD na-
tion has a 10.2 percent inflation rate. 
As the gentleman knows, ours is 8.3 
percent. 
Mexico didn’t have any of the bills 
that we passed and had an 8.7 inflation 
rate. The Netherlands that didn’t have 
an American Rescue Plan has a 13.6 
percent rate of inflation. Sweden, a 
small and very successful country, 
didn’t have an American Rescue Plan 
and has an inflation rate of 9.8 percent; 
Austria, 
another 
strong 
economic 
country, 9.3 percent; Denmark, the 
country of my father’s birth, 8.9 per-
cent. 
And you say: So what? The ‘‘so 
what’’ is that we have seen a global in-
flation. I haven’t mentioned some of 
the other countries in Asia who have 
inflation rates, as well. I simply say 
that so both parties and all Members 
understand the consequences and pain 
of inflation at the pump. 
The gentleman in some of the discus-
sions we have had has pointed out that 
prices have gone up. I have not heard 
him say that the President has taken 
certain action, and it has come down 
about 35-plus percent over the last 6, 7 
weeks from $5.02 as an average down to 
somewhere around $3.60. 
Is that low enough? It is not. It has 
been much higher. It was higher in 2008 
under George Bush. But it needs to 
come down further. We will continue to 
work on that. 
We passed a number of pieces of leg-
islation. I mentioned the American 
Rescue Plan took 48 percent of Amer-
ica’s children out of poverty who were 
in poverty; not 48 percent of America’s 
children, but 48 percent of America’s 
children who were in poverty were 
taken out by the American Rescue 
Plan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7864 
September 15, 2022 
None of us are wearing masks on this 
floor or around the country when we 
gather together and get in rooms close 
to one another. Why? Because we got 
250 million shots in arms. 
We also have people struggling for a 
variety of economic reasons primarily 
brought upon them by the pandemic, so 
we put money in their pockets. 
We have one of the fastest growing 
economies. We have one of the lowest 
unemployment rates in the world. We 
have a country that is doing well. 
The gentleman mentions the stock 
market declining. It did. Why did it de-
cline? Because we had the pandemic. 
Inflation resulted from that, and the 
Federal Reserve—as was true under 
Ronald Reagan when unemployment 
went to 10.5, 6, 7, 8 percent because 
Paul Volcker was slowing down the 
economy to defeat inflation. 
Inflation is harmful, particularly to 
people who are elderly and on fixed in-
comes. So, I want the gentleman to 
know that we empathize with that, 
and, therefore, we are distressed. 
When we passed a bill, the Inflation 
Reduction Act, not a single Republican 
voted for it. 
b 1600 
And there is absolutely no denial on 
the reality that is going to bring Amer-
icans’ costs down. Not only that, it 
kept 13 million people who were going 
to fall off insurance on the Affordable 
Care Act—which I know the gentle-
man’s party does not support—but 13 
million Americans who had healthcare 
insurance as a result of the American 
Rescue Plan, it was going to stop on 
December 31, and we continued that. 
We put on legislation that would 
bring down prescription drug costs and 
allow companies to sell drugs to Medi-
care in a negotiated way. We negotiate, 
as the gentleman knows, and I don’t 
know whether the gentleman thinks 
that policy ought to be stopped, but we 
negotiated for prices with veterans’ 
healthcare. Now we are going to do it 
with Medicare. We wanted to do it for 
everybody, but the Senate Republicans 
would not agree to that. 
We believe that the infrastructure 
bill is going to really help bring down 
inflation, create jobs, and expand our 
economy. We believe the CHIPS and 
Science bill is going to do the same. 
Only 13 on the Republican side voted 
for the infrastructure bill, which was, I 
think, a bill that would have helped in-
flation by making supplies better. The 
energy portion of the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act is going to bring down the 
cost of energy. It is going to create 
competition on energy, and fight cli-
mate change. I lament the fact that 
not a single Republican voted for the 
Inflation Reduction Act. 
Even if you reject the fact that it is 
going to reduce inflation—as I think 
you probably do, I don’t want to antici-
pate what you do, but that is my guess. 
There are literally scores of econo-
mists who believe it is going to bring 
down inflation. 
As importantly, the committee who 
looks closely at this—scores of econo-
mists say it is going to bring it down. 
The Committee for a Responsible Fed-
eral Budget say they believe it is going 
to bring down inflation. I don’t want to 
project that it is going to bring it down 
a half a point, a point, 2 points, 3 
points, 4 points—I hope it does. I think 
it was certainly worth a try. 
None of your colleagues either in this 
House or in the Senate—down the 
aisle—gave it a chance. We passed it 
anyway under a process, obviously, 
that allows just Democrats in the Sen-
ate to pass something under a process 
called reconciliation. 
I want to tell the gentleman that I 
have apprised the committee chairmen 
of the bills that you have talked to me 
about. I have asked them to look at 
them. Frankly, I cannot tell you I have 
gotten a response from each one of 
them, but we are giving them atten-
tion. 
Obviously, we want to know what our 
committees think about not only your 
legislation, our legislation—our legis-
lation, that is, bipartisan legislation. 
We lament the fact, I will tell you, 
very frankly, Mr. Speaker—we lament 
the fact that our Republican colleagues 
in all four of the bills I have just men-
tioned, which are designed to grow the 
economy—the CHIPS bill, the bipar-
tisan infrastructure—19 Senators voted 
for the infrastructure bill and helped 
put it together with President Biden 
and Senate Democrats. Lamentably, 
only 13 of your colleagues chose to vote 
for it. I am glad they did, but it was 
over the advice and counsel of their 
leadership. That bill clearly was em-
braced by the American people and in-
corporated policies, essentially, that 
President Trump said in 2016 he was 
going to recommend and have the Con-
gress adopt. It didn’t happen in 2017. It 
didn’t happen in 2018. It didn’t happen 
in 2019, and it didn’t happen in 2020. 
I say to my friend, we think all four 
of those bills are going to have a very 
positive impact on our economy, on 
growing our economy, ensuring sup-
plies of basic goods, and bringing down 
inflation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, there are 
a lot of different bills the gentleman 
mentioned. Each one of them, by the 
way, when you rack them up, adds up 
to trillions of dollars in new spending. 
If trillions in Washington spending 
were going to solve the problem, then 
we would have no inflation. 
Obviously, it has gone the opposite 
direction, and it is going the opposite 
direction because of the trillions of 
dollars in new spending if you go down 
the line. Obviously, the gentleman 
went through all of those things, and I 
would like to respond to a number of 
them because it just doesn’t mesh with 
the realities of where our economy is 
today. 
If you look at the numbers—and we 
can talk about other countries—other 
countries have passed bad policies that 
have wrecked their economies. You can 
see Europe right now finally having a 
renewed debate on energy policy be-
cause they passed some really foolish 
energy policies that are destroying 
their energy economies and making 
them more dependent on Russia, for ex-
ample, to get their oil and to get their 
natural gas. They are finally waking 
up. 
A lot of them shut their nuclear 
plants down, which is safe, sound nu-
clear 
energy. 
They 
wrecked 
their 
economies. They are starting to re-
verse that. I am glad they are finally 
waking up and reversing course. 
It seems like right here in Wash-
ington the failed policies that Presi-
dent Biden has put in place, they want 
to double down on. When you look at 
the results of it, that is why we get 
where we are which is double digit in-
creases in food costs that our families 
are facing. Electricity costs over 15 
percent higher just over the last year, 
and it is about to get worse because the 
bill that the President was celebrating 
at the White House had another in-
crease in taxes on natural gas, which 
will raise those costs even higher. 
Mr. Speaker, I will yield to the gen-
tleman in a moment. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I can’t see 
the chart. Could you tell me what it 
says so I know what the gentleman is 
talking about? 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, elec-
tricity rates are 15.8 percent higher 
than last year. 
Mr. HOYER. Here? 
Mr. SCALISE. In America. This is all 
in America. Families that we represent 
are facing the burden of all of these 
policies that started in Washington 
that are ultimately ending up taking 
money out of their pockets. 
When you go to the grocery store—if 
you can afford to get there—if you find 
the food on the shelves, it is 131⁄2 per-
cent higher. We have seen the list, 
whether it is eggs, dairy products, 
bacon, some of them are 30 percent 
higher individually, but it adds up to 
about 131⁄2 percent more that you are 
paying at the grocery store. 
Mortgage rates. If somebody is trying 
to become a first-time home buyer, 
which is part of the American dream, 
today it is 110 percent higher to get a 
mortgage than it was a year ago. Most 
economists, including many Democrat 
economists, point to the trillions in 
spending in Washington as the reason 
for that. Families have figured this out 
and said: Stop the madness. 
Yet, again, at the White House in the 
most tone-deaf thing I have seen in a 
while, the President is having a party 
celebrating a $730 billion increase in 
taxes and spending at the exact same 
time that the market is tanking be-
cause of the inflation created by all 
this spending. 
To finish it up, transportation costs 
are 11.3 percent higher. That is what is 
happening in America. 
Again, Europe did a lot of these same 
bad policies. They figured it out, and

September 15, 2022 
they are starting to reverse course. 
They just got rid of their Prime Min-
ister in England because of what they 
did to wreck their energy economy. 
We brought bills—as I shared with 
the gentleman over months—we have 
brought a number of bills forward that 
would solve these problems, and not 
one of them has been scheduled for a 
vote on the House floor. We want to ad-
dress this problem. We don’t just sit 
back and go: Well, it is happening in 
other countries, so let it stay racking 
up in America. It doesn’t need to. 
These are all unforced errors that are 
the result of failed policies, and instead 
of stopping the failed policies and 
working with Republicans to turn it 
around and lower these costs, it seems 
like there is a desire to just double 
down and talk about trillions more to 
spend. 
If spending was solving the problems, 
then we would have none of these prob-
lems. The problems have gotten worse 
with each multi-trillion or multi-hun-
dred-billion-dollar package of legisla-
tion that has come out of this body. 
At some point, I would hope that the 
other side would look and recognize 
and say, okay, forget about Europe and 
Asia. They need to look in the mirror 
and say, why did they create some of 
their problems? 
We can do something about these 
problems. We brought those ideas for-
ward, and every single time we have 
been told no, which must mean that 
this is okay. Because this is not okay 
to us, and there is a way to reverse it. 
If just spending more money and hav-
ing parties at the White House to cele-
brate that spending while Rome is 
burning is where we are going to be, I 
think there is going to be a day of 
reckoning on that. I don’t think the 
country is comfortable where we are. 
And when the idea is to just keep 
spending more money and act like— 
maybe it is another $5 trillion—what is 
the number that is going to finally get 
us out of this mess? If it was trillions, 
we would be there already. 
Maybe, just maybe, we need to look 
at going the other way. Stop paying 
people not to work, for example, when 
everybody is looking for workers. Un-
fortunately, the IRS is looking for 
87,000 more people. And as CBO just 
confirmed, a lot of that is going to be 
going after hardworking families, fami-
lies making under $400,000 a year, even 
though we were promised on this floor 
that wouldn’t happen. 
We brought an amendment to ensure 
that President Biden’s promise would 
be upheld. We brought an amendment 
that would say and ensure no American 
making under $400,000 would see their 
taxes go up with these 87,000 new IRS 
agents. The majority rejected that 
amendment. Literally, the day of the 
vote, the Congressional Budget Office 
came out and confirmed that it is over 
$20 billion in new taxes. 
That bill is going to cost families 
making less than $400,000. Those fami-
lies are already struggling. They would 
love to save up and buy a new house. 
They can’t even afford to get to the 
grocery store to pay 131⁄2 percent more. 
If they try to go get a mortgage today, 
they are going to be paying more than 
double for that mortgage than they 
were a year ago. 
At some point we have got to stop 
these failed policies that are causing 
these problems. Go look at what some 
of these other countries are doing to fi-
nally reverse course because they are, 
and they need to, but so do we. I would 
hope that we would bring some of those 
bills to the House floor because we 
could start reversing these horrible 
trends now. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
First, let me say, the gentleman dis-
misses what other countries are doing 
or he says they are doing bad things 
and therefore they have inflation. 
Every country has inflation. Why? 
Because the pandemic shut down the 
world. It shut down the markets. It 
shut down the production of supplies. 
That is why. People had to stay home 
and they weren’t out producing and 
making things. 
We kept a lot of people employed. We 
spent trillions of dollars doing it, 
which were bipartisan bills signed by 
Donald Trump. Trillions. As soon as 
Donald Trump left, all of a sudden the 
other party—his party, the Trump 
party, decided it is over. It wasn’t over 
for the American people. 
Kids were not in schools. People 
hadn’t been given shots in arms yet. 
People were really hurting. Those 48 
percent of the children in poverty were 
still in poverty, but it was over. No 
more bipartisanship. It is another 
President, so we are going to blame 
him. 
That is politics over people. What we 
did is people over politics because we 
knew people were hurting. We passed 
legislation to give them help. Every 
Republican, Mr. Speaker, voted no. 
We voted to help them gets shots in 
arms. Every Republican voted no. 
We voted to get their kids back in 
school to make their schools safe and 
healthy. Every Republican voted no be-
cause they wanted to bleat about infla-
tion. 
The reason they don’t like these fig-
ures is because these are the economi-
cally successful nations of the world, 
many of whom have inflation higher 
than we. 
The gentleman is absolutely right. 
We need to get inflation down. There 
are 126 economists that say that the In-
flation Reduction Act will reduce infla-
tion, reduce healthcare costs, and re-
duce energy costs. 
Now, the gentleman and I have had 
this discussion about his energy bills, 
which they think will be the salvation. 
They always think: Drill more, life will 
be better. I get it. Louisiana is a State 
that wants to drill. I get that. We use 
that product. It is an important prod-
uct, and we are going to continue to 
use it. That is why I have no criticism 
of that. 
In the last bill that we passed, which 
is really going to fight the climate 
challenge that we face—there were four 
1,000-year floods in four different com-
munities in America within 30 days of 
one another. 
b 1615 
The West is on fire, literally and 
figuratively. Climate challenge is real. 
Every Republican voted ‘‘no’’ to invest 
in meeting that challenge head-on; 
every Republican, House and Senate, 
Mr. Speaker. 
I can’t read the chart, but 13 percent 
inflation is too high. I go to the gro-
cery store almost every weekend. I live 
alone. I don’t buy a lot of food at any 
one time because I am traveling a lot 
and here a lot; don’t want it to go bad. 
So I get it on the prices. I get it on 
gasoline prices. They are tough. That 
is why we passed a food and fuel bill. 
The gentleman from Louisiana voted 
‘‘no.’’ The leader of the Republican 
Party, Mr. MCCARTHY, in the House, 
voted ‘‘no’’, and the overwhelming ma-
jority of Republicans voted ‘‘no.’’ 
They wanted to make sure that we 
had competition. That is the free mar-
ket system. That is what brings prices 
down. If you have a monopoly, you can 
charge anything you want if people 
need the product. 
Now, I won’t go through the statis-
tics because the statistics are we are 
producing more energy today than we 
produced 2 years ago. I read those sta-
tistics. I am not going to bore the gen-
tleman, Mr. Speaker, with them again. 
They don’t bore me because it shows 
that—when the argument is the reason 
we have inflation is because we are not 
producing energy, the reason we don’t 
have as much energy is because compa-
nies made a rational decision. What 
was that rational decision? 
In March and April of 2020, people 
started staying in their homes. They 
stopped buying gas and other products, 
petroleum products, and, as a result, 
corporations made a reasonable judg-
ment. We are not going to produce 
more capacity. 
So, when we got out of the inflation, 
we are still not doing that. But we are 
doing more than we did some years 
ago, as those statistics that I read to 
the gentleman three or four times, so I 
won’t read them again. 
But the industry, as I have also told 
the gentleman, owns 9,000 unused per-
mits to drill onshore; 37 million acres 
offshore; which can be permitted, ready 
to go. 
So when you simply ignore and pre-
tend that somehow Joe Biden, the 
President of the United States, is re-
sponsible for worldwide inflation, and 
dismiss the pandemic—I don’t think I 
have heard one time, Mr. Speaker, the 
Republican whip mention the pandemic 
as a cause of the inflation. It is all 
about energy. 
I beg to differ with the gentleman, 
Mr. Speaker. I think, honestly, the 
American people need to know that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7866 
September 15, 2022 
Yes, the stock market had a rough 
tumble. Why did it have a rough tum-
ble? Because the Federal Reserve, the 
chairman of which was appointed by 
President Trump, responsibly, along 
with his board of governors, responded 
to try to get this inflation under con-
trol and bring it down. 
I don’t know whether the gentleman 
supports that action or not. Ronald 
Reagan 
supported that action; al-
though he did not appoint the chair-
man of the Federal Reserve that did it. 
So, Mr. Speaker, we are going to con-
tinue to fight for the people and put 
them above our politics, or even our 
own personal economic interests, by 
passing the American Rescue Plan; by 
passing the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill; by making sure that America can 
be seen as a country that makes it in 
America; chips, investing in science for 
the future, for the people and, yes, the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which the 
gentleman and his party has misrepre-
sented over and over and over again 
with something they know is not the 
truth. 
They project 80,000 new people going 
after average Americans. They know 
that is not true, Mr. Speaker. 
After years of trying to defund the 
people who collect the revenues from 
our people so everybody pays their fair 
share, and those of us—and I say of 
us—who are doing well, pay our fair 
share, and the people who make bil-
lions, who pay less of a percentage, in 
many respects, as Warren Buffett said, 
than those who work for them. 
Yes, we want taxes fairly enforced, 
Mr. Speaker. We don’t want anybody 
paying an unfair share because some-
body is not paying at all. 
The IRS will, after those 10 years of 
accretion of employees, have as many 
employees as it had back in the 1990s; 
trying to make sure it can, in fact, en-
force a fair system that provides the 
revenues that the Federal Government 
needs to protect, preserve our people’s 
welfare, economy, and national secu-
rity. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, first, to 
clarify, it wasn’t me who said that the 
IRS agents, this new army of 87,000 IRS 
agents, would be going after people to 
collect $20 billion more in taxes who 
were making less than $400,000. 
It was the Congressional Budget Of-
fice who put in their report the day of 
the vote that that is exactly what 
would happen, is that those IRS agents 
would, in fact, be going after people 
making less than $400,000, to the tune 
of $20 billion in new taxes. 
We brought an amendment to stop 
that from happening, to say they can’t 
go after those people making less than 
$400,000, which is what the President 
promised. The Congressional Budget 
Office report was right there, saying 
$20 billion is what they would pay in 
new taxes. The majority rejected the 
amendment. So clearly, the intention 
was to have those IRS agents go after 
them. 
Again, those weren’t my numbers. 
That was the Congressional Budget Of-
fice. If there is a dispute the gentleman 
has, take it up with them. But they 
were the ones who came out with that 
report the day of the vote. Maybe that 
was why the bill was rushed through. 
But we pointed that out, and no one 
disputed that the Congressional Budget 
Office put those numbers out there. 
But the President still kept saying, 
don’t worry. They are not going to go 
after them, not a dime. But CBO said 
$20 billion in new taxes those low- and 
middle-income families will pay. We 
tried to stop it. The majority rejected 
it. 
Now, to go to the oil and gas com-
ments 
the 
gentleman 
made 
about 
President Biden, you would think, lis-
tening to your comments, that Joe 
Biden was John D. Rockefeller, and he 
is 
drilling 
everywhere. 
Well, 
let’s 
first—— 
Mr. HOYER. I don’t think I made 
that comment. 
Mr. SCALISE. And I won’t say the 
gentleman did, but as the gentleman 
talked about all this production and 
drilling that is going on and all this oil 
that is coming out, it was Joe Biden 
who said, as a candidate, ‘‘no more 
drilling on Federal lands. No more 
drilling, including offshore. No ability 
for the oil industry to continue to drill, 
period.’’ 
Then he carried out policies to back 
that up and stop drilling. 
We have pointed out many times, 
major companies in America that want 
to increase production, as the gen-
tleman did say, that they are not in-
creasing production. They tried, and 
they have been rejected on the permits 
they would need. 
You can’t just go drill a new hole to-
morrow. Every well ultimately de-
pletes. We all know that. That has been 
going on since man invented the abil-
ity to drill for oil in the world. So as 
oil depletes, you need to get new per-
mits to go into these areas. The Biden 
administration, over and over again, 
rejected those new permits. 
So there are leases out there. Again, 
a lease might be like you have a car. 
You have got a car in your driveway. 
Well, if you don’t have an engine in the 
car, the car is not functional. 
If you have a lease, the lease doesn’t 
do you any good if you can’t get the 
permits to build pipelines. We have 
talked about the pipeline problems as 
this administration, over and over 
again, has blocked new pipelines. 
How do you move the oil? How do you 
get the permit to go and explore for 
more? 
So what the President did—again, if 
we were just maxed out on drilling 
here, why did the President get on Air 
Force One and fly 5,700 miles to Saudi 
Arabia to beg them to produce more 
oil? They said no because they don’t 
have the ability over there. 
The President called Vladimir Putin 
and asked him to drill for more oil. 
Putin said no. 
You don’t need to ask those coun-
tries to produce more oil because we 
have it here, but there is documented 
evidence, over and over, where this ad-
ministration has said no to permits, no 
to the ability for us to produce more of 
our own energy. 
So what happens? The price goes up. 
They are talking about, during this 
winter, the inability for people to have 
home heating oil. So they are import-
ing it from countries like Russia be-
cause they are not allowing more pro-
duction here, where companies are try-
ing to produce more and being turned 
down by this administration. 
The Secretary—I think it was the 
Secretary 
of 
Energy—when 
asked, 
what is your plan to produce more in 
America, she started laughing. It is not 
a laughing matter, but that has been 
the attitude of this administration. 
To finish up on the point where the 
gentleman started talking about all 
these bills that we voted against, start-
ing with the $1.9 trillion spending bill 
that this administration came right 
out of the box with. As the economy 
was starting to turn around, and people 
were starting to bring workers back, 
trying to get workers back, a $1.9 tril-
lion package of bills came forward to 
pay people, in part, not to work, to 
stay at home; made it harder for people 
to get workers back. 
But what it also did—and this is 
something we brought up during the 
debate—checks were being sent to peo-
ple. 
Well, we pointed out that checks 
were going to end up going to people in 
prisons, and we were told that wasn’t 
going to happen. Just like with the 
87,000 IRS agents, when CBO debunked 
that. Don’t worry; nobody in prison is 
going to get checks. Turned out later, 
the Boston bomber got a check. 
Who knows how many billions of dol-
lars went to prisoners to be paid—tax-
payers are already paying for them to 
be housed, to be fed, to get healthcare. 
But then they also got checks, actual 
checks in stimulus money. We had an 
amendment to stop that from hap-
pening. 
But ultimately, yes, we voted against 
those things because we wanted to see 
our economy back open. 
When there was this idea that every-
body had to stay home, that wasn’t the 
case when we started last year. In fact, 
many States started to open again. 
There were some States that stayed 
shut down. 
By the way, you can see a massive 
movement around the country, where 
New York State alone lost about a mil-
lion people who moved to States like 
Florida because they didn’t want to be 
shut down anymore when there was a 
State that was open, following safety 
protocols, protecting their people, but 
allowing people to live in freedom 
again and live their lives. 
So people moved out of States, the 
shut down States like California and 
New York and moved to States that 
were open. You can see the numbers, 
and they are dramatic numbers. 
So not every State handled it the 
same. But the States that opened were

having a lot more success in protecting 
their people at the same time, but the 
States that stayed closed had dev-
astating consequences. 
Not to mention what we saw with 
children being shut out of school, the 
learning that wasn’t happening. Those 
are devastating numbers we are seeing 
today 
because 
this 
administration 
changed the science—and that is docu-
mented—changed the science over at 
CDC to cater to the unions who wanted 
to keep schools shut down. So millions 
of kids didn’t learn at the levels they 
should have, and those numbers are 
still showing up today, that those kids 
were left behind; lost a year or 2 years 
they will never get back because other 
kids were in school learning, when the 
unions wanted to work with the Biden 
administration to keep schools shut 
down. 
So those are the things that we tried 
to address. None of those bills were al-
lowed to come to the floor. But that is 
where we are. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
First of all, to your last statement, 
the unions. What were the unions try-
ing to do? They were trying to keep 
teachers healthy. They were trying to 
keep kids healthy. Because we were 
telling people, don’t congregate. Don’t 
get all together. 
They were trying to keep kids out of 
school whose HVAC systems, heating, 
ventilating systems were not up to 
date and couldn’t transfer the air in a 
clean, healthy way. 
So we gave them billions of dollars. 
Yes, we spent a lot of money to make 
our people safe, to get people back to 
work, to get kids back in school, and it 
worked. They are back in school. 
None of us are wearing a mask. We 
congregate now. We all get together. 
Hardly anybody, if anybody, some peo-
ple who have particular vulnerabilities 
are wearing masks. God bless them. It 
worked, and the Republicans voted 
‘‘no.’’ 
b 1630 
Now, I want to go to this energy 
issue because they are Johnny-one- 
note. Inflation is caused by administra-
tion policy on inflation, gas prices, and 
energy production. But the fact of the 
matter is he ignores that inflation is 
happening in a lot of places. 
Mr. Speaker, in Denmark, they are 
pretty energy independent with renew-
able energies and not relying on supply 
chains per se. Their inflation is higher 
than ours because it was a global phe-
nomenon. Their economies were as-
saulted. Ours came back faster and bet-
ter. 
Why? Because we invested in our peo-
ple. 
Now, let me go to a simple fact. Ac-
cording to the U.S. Energy Information 
Administration, average production— 
that means over 4 years for Trump—for 
Donald Trump was 10,968,000 barrels per 
day; for Joe Biden it was 11,185,000 bar-
rels a day. That is more, not less, than 
the average under Donald Trump. But 
it serves their political interest, Mr. 
Speaker, to somehow project to the 
American people that Biden has shut 
down the energy industry which is why 
you are paying more. 
I explained that the energy compa-
nies did, in fact, cut production. It was 
a rational business judgment. People 
were driving less and buying less petro-
leum. 
There is still concern. Most of them 
are seeing that there is going to be an 
alternative energy that is going to be 
required if we are going to make sure 
that this globe does not burn up with 
the people with it. 
He also says—I don’t have the report 
in front of me, so I am going to wing 
it—that no one earning under $400,000 
per year got a tax increase as a result 
of the bill the gentleman alludes to. 
If CBO says—and I will read the re-
port—that $20 billion is going to be re-
ceived from that category, it will be 
because somebody, whether they are 
making $100,000, $200,000, $300,000, or 
$400,000, is not paying their fair share 
pursuant to laws that we adopt—not 
because we put new taxes on them but 
because they are not paying the taxes 
that are due. 
I don’t have the CBO report in front 
of me, so I am opining because it cer-
tainly wasn’t because we have new en-
forcement officers, unless those en-
forcement officers find that the people 
to which the gentleman refers are not 
paying their fair share. 
By the way, it will also apply to the 
people who are making billions and not 
paying any taxes, much less their fair 
share. 
Let me repeat that energy figure 
again because I think he will probably 
go back to energy because that is what 
we do almost every colloquy. More en-
ergy is being produced under Joe Biden 
than 
was 
produced 
under 
Donald 
Trump. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, if Joe 
Biden wants to keep producing more 
energy, we are giving him opportuni-
ties, but he says no. He said ‘‘no’’ many 
times, and he campaigned on that. We 
will continue to push to bring those 
bills to the floor. 
We are going to continue to push to 
bring bills to the floor to solve a lot of 
these problems that we have identified, 
and we have bills to address them. If 
the majority doesn’t want to bring 
them up, I understand. That is the pre-
rogative of the majority, but we are 
going to still keep talking about them. 
We are going to still keep pushing 
every opportunity we can to bring 
down inflation, to lower energy costs, 
and to address so many of these other 
problems that people are still facing 
today. 
If that single mom who is working as 
a waitress two shifts is going to be au-
dited by some new IRS agent who is 
tasked, under the terms that we saw, 
with going out and generating that 
money, if the result of that is that she 
has to pay more money, it doesn’t 
mean she is cheating on her taxes. If 
all of a sudden an auditor is coming 
after you, who knows what kind of 
pressure they are putting? 
But it is 87,000 more IRS agents 
tasked with going and generating not 
$20 billion. The $20 billion is just for 
the people making under $400,000. It is 
over $250 billion that some of the num-
bers show that they have to generate, 
meaning they are going to have to go 
out and find that from taxpayers. 
That doesn’t mean every one of those 
people they audit is a tax cheat. It just 
means that person is going to now face 
an audit who otherwise is working two 
or three shifts to meet the demands of 
these higher costs that they are facing 
because of inflation. 
We are going to continue fighting for 
those hardworking families and fight-
ing to lower the burden on this govern-
ment, take some of that heat off so 
they can spend more time at home 
with their family, not working two or 
three shifts or worrying about the next 
audit they are going to face from a new 
IRS agent who is told to go generate 
more money. Hopefully, we can address 
that. We will continue to push for that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I think we 
are probably pretty close to closing. 
I would say this, Mr. Speaker. I think 
the American people are in the process 
of making a judgment. On our side, we 
see things as pretty positive in terms 
of the response to the policies that we 
have been adopting without any sig-
nificant help from our Republican col-
leagues, but they will have a chance to 
vote and decide. 
We have passed legislation, as we 
said we would do, for the people—not 
for the sake of politics but for the sake 
of children, families, the young and 
old, and, yes, even the rich and poor. 
I want to comment because I urge my 
Republican friends to be precise in 
their conversations with the American 
public. There are not 80,000 revenue 
auditors or agents included in this bill 
that we talked about on bringing infla-
tion down and which economists say 
will bring inflation down. 
Our Republican friends say they want 
to do that, but they vote against bills 
that will bring down demonstrably, and 
without possibility of denial, costs for 
people, health costs for people, pre-
scription drug costs for people, insulin, 
which costs about—it is single figures, 
and we capped it at $35. That is about 
400 percent profit, but they are now 
paying $300 or $400 or $500. 
Now, luckily, because we could pass 
it with Democrats, seniors won’t be 
paying that. They will be capped at $35. 
But millions of other Americans, be-
cause the Republicans would not sup-
port it in the United States Senate—we 
passed it here—will not get the benefit 
of that cap. They will be paying far 
above justifiable prices for insulin.

September 15, 2022 
We are producing energy. The argu-
ment is specious that somehow this in-
flation is caused by our cutting back 
on energy supply when I just read a fig-
ure, subject to dispute. Maybe next 
week I will hear, no, that figure is 
wrong. Maybe. We are producing more 
energy than Trump did—not Trump 
himself, 
but 
the 
country—during 
Trump’s Presidency. 
I urge, Mr. Speaker, my Republican 
friends to tell the American people the 
truth. Yes, there are some more agents 
because there are people not paying 
their fair share. If you have an audit, 
and they say you are not paying your 
fair share, and you pay more, isn’t that 
what we expect when we pass tax bills, 
that people will pay pursuant to what 
the law says, whether they make 
$100,000 or $100 million or $100 billion? I 
don’t guess anybody makes $100 billion 
in a year. 
We ought to be honest with the 
American people. Give them the facts, 
and then they will make a decision, but 
tell them the truth. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, we will 
continue to be honest with the Amer-
ican people. It was the administration 
that used the 87,000 number. If that 
number should be lower, I would love 
to hear what that number would be. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. SCALISE. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. If the gen-
tleman has a number, please tell me 
because that is what we heard from the 
administration. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, there are 
80,000-plus additional, which will get 
back to the 20 years ago level of em-
ployment in the IRS. The IRS has been 
reduced in personnel in all categories, 
not just enforcement agents, but in all 
categories, which will undermine their 
ability to serve the public and collect 
taxes so that we all pay our fair share 
and so people who don’t have account-
ants and who don’t have ways and 
means to avoid taxes are treated fairly 
themselves. 
Everybody ought to be treated fairly. 
If we don’t think they are being treat-
ed fairly because of the law then we 
ought to change the law, but we ought 
to tell the American people the truth. 
There are not that many enforce-
ment agents. They are in so many dif-
ferent categories in the IRS to make 
sure that the IRS can successfully do 
its job and answer people’s questions 
about what, when, where, and why they 
have to do things pursuant to law. 
That is what I meant, not that the 
80,000 people are enforcement agents. 
They are not. They are not. It is a far 
lower number than that. 
But we know that there is over $100 
billion—I think it is a much larger fig-
ure than that—in taxes that are owed 
under the law that are not being paid, 
which means that the tax rates need to 
be higher on others than they ought to 
be. 
That is what this bill gets at. In 
other words, this bill, the inflation re-
duction bill, is more than reducing in-
flation. I am sorry that my Republican 
friends made a determination it was 
not a bill they could support to help 
bring down inflation, but that was the 
judgment they made. 
I think they want to bring down in-
flation. We want to bring down infla-
tion, but when we present a bill to the 
floor which does it, we would hope we 
would get support on a bipartisan 
basis. 
Mr. SCALISE. We will continue to 
tell the truth about these policies. 
Clearly, there is a disagreement on 
many of them, but that is why we have 
this debate. I look forward to con-
tinuing it with the gentleman. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING RETIRED NEW JERSEY 
STATE SENATOR RONALD L. RICE 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor New Jersey State Sen-
ator Ronald L. Rice after his retire-
ment on August 31 of this year. 
Senator Rice served the people of 
New Jersey’s 28th District for 36 years. 
He was the longest serving Black legis-
lator in our State’s history. 
Senator Rice was first elected to the 
Newark City Council in 1981. Then, he 
was elected to the State Senate in 1986 
and won reelection 11 times before he 
retired. 
His service extended beyond politics. 
Senator Rice was a sergeant in the Ma-
rine Corps and a decorated Vietnam 
veteran. He spent 8 years as a police 
detective in the city of Newark and 4 
years as its deputy mayor. 
He was known for his strong support 
and advocacy for social justice and 
civil rights. Recently, Newark renamed 
a street in his neighborhood in his 
honor for his commitment and service 
to the city of Newark. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate State 
Senator Ronald L. Rice on his tremen-
dous career as a public servant. His 
work for Newark and the people of New 
Jersey will be missed. But I am sure 
this will not be the last we hear from 
our hero and our fighter, Senator Ron-
ald L. Rice.

RECOGNIZING ALAN DEWART 
(Mr. JACOBS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JACOBS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to recognize and cele-
brate the 80th birthday of Alan Dewart, 
a business and civic leader in our com-
munity. 
Alan has been an entrepreneur and 
real estate developer for his entire pro-
fessional life. Alan’s impact on the re-
vitalization of the city of Buffalo is un-
paralleled. 
During the dark economic times of 
the 1980s when the city was experi-
encing a mass exodus of people, busi-
nesses, and hope, Alan was a pioneer 
who reinvested and revitalized a sec-
tion of downtown Buffalo, taking va-
cant and derelict buildings in Buffalo’s 
theater district and transforming it 
into a vibrant city center consisting of 
apartments, restaurants, and music/en-
tertainment venues, infusing life and 
vibrancy back into a historically sig-
nificant section of our city. 
Alan’s pioneering work sowed the 
seeds of future developers and future 
projects to bring downtown Buffalo 
back to life. 
I interned for Alan Dewart as a col-
lege student and through him devel-
oped a passion for urban revitalization. 
He is a friend and a mentor, and I 
thank him for all he has done for me 
and all he has done for our city.

WE MUST ENSHRINE THE FREE-
DOMS ROE V. WADE PROTECTED 
(Mr. MALINOWSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
when the Supreme Court overturned 
Roe v. Wade, Republicans swore up and 
down that all they wanted was for the 
States to decide. 
But this week, in this Congress, they 
introduced a national criminal ban on 
abortion, saying this is what we stand 
for, this is what we will do if our party 
takes the House and Senate. 
Their bill is designed for one purpose 
and will have one effect: to shred pro-
tections women still enjoy in States 
like New Jersey, where we codified Roe 
v. Wade this year. 
Let me tell you where the over-
whelming majority of folks in New Jer-
sey stand. We know abortion is a pain-
ful and personal issue for many fami-
lies. That is precisely why we want and 
trust women to decide, not the govern-
ment. The issue is complicated. Who 
decides is not. 
That is why I will do everything in 
my power to prevent Congress from im-
posing on New Jersey laws that treat 
women and doctors as criminals and 
why we must enshrine the freedoms 
Roe v. Wade protected in the law of our 
land once and for all.

tonight to acknowledge the loss of a 
pillar of our community in northern

September 15, 2022 
He was born in 1938 in Nangal Khurd, 
Hoshiarpur District of Punjab, India, 
to a farming family. As a young man, 
he immigrated in 1958 to Sutter Coun-
ty, settling in Yuba City, because of 
the potential he saw in the land, soil, 
weather, and its likeness to Punjab, 
India. 
Indeed, it worked out very well. 
Through his hard work and determina-
tion, he became the largest inde-
pendent peach grower in the world, 
earning him the title of ‘‘the Peach 
King.’’ 
He was a deeply religious man, a 
leader in the Yuba-Sutter area, philan-
thropist, and active member of the 
Sikh Temple of Yuba City. 
He played a critical role in founding 
Sikh institutions and festivals in the 
Yuba City area, as well as around the 
world. 
In 1980, he started the Yuba Nagar 
Kirtan, called the Yuba Sikh Parade, 
which has now become an annual event 
and a staple to the area where people 
travel from all over the State, even all 
over North America, tens of thousands, 
to take part. I have had a chance to 
take part myself. It is indeed incred-
ible. 
When Sikhs faced hate crimes after 
the September 11 terrorist attacks due 
to misunderstanding, it was Didar who 
led a delegation of Sikhs to meet the 
U.S. President, George W. Bush, at the 
time. 
He was a pillar of our community. 
His loss will be felt by Yuba City and 
indeed internationally.

HONORING MS. WHEELCHAIR 
AMERICA ALI INGERSOLL 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to highlight Raleigh’s own Ali Inger-
soll, who won the title of Ms. Wheel-
chair America last month. 
Ms. Wheelchair America is not your 
typical beauty pageant. Contestants 
are evaluated on their community ad-
vocacy and achievements, and the win-
ner carries the responsibility of being a 
champion for the 61 million Americans 
living with disabilities. 
Ali Ingersoll has embodied that mis-
sion since an incident left her para-
lyzed 12 years ago. She has dedicated 
much of her adult life to advocating for 
affordable healthcare for individuals 
with disabilities. 
As Ali personally experienced in 2020, 
insurance companies often deny cov-
erage of important equipment to help 
these Americans lead fulfilling lives. 
Now, Ali is fighting for full coverage of 
medically necessary equipment. 
I am honored to represent Ms. Wheel-
chair America and look forward to ev-
erything she will accomplish in the fu-
ture. 
HONORING EDITH K. KENAO 
KANAKA’OLE 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize September as Ha-
waiian History Month in my home 
State of Hawaii. It is a time of celebra-
tion, recognition, and reflection. 
Throughout this month, we honor in-
dividuals who have made a significant 
impact on the lives of Native Hawai-
ians everywhere. 
Today, 
we 
recognize 
Edith 
Ke’kuhikuhiipu’uoneonaali’iokohala 
Kenao Kanaka’ole, a revered Native 
Hawaiian 
dancer, 
chanter, 
teacher, 
kuma hula and founder of Halau o 
Kekuhi. 
Edith was one of only five women in 
the country honored this year in the 
2023 American Women Quarters Pro-
gram. 
‘‘Grant us knowledge.’’ ‘‘E ho mai 
ka’ike,’’ is inscribed on the commemo-
rative coin for Edith Kanaka’ole. It is 
a reminder of her lasting legacy and a 
guiding principle for Hawaiians. That 
is, to look to those who came before us 
so that we may find success in the 
present and prosperity in our future.

(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
first want to indicate my appreciation 
to 
President 
Biden 
and 
Secretary 
Walsh, for, yes, diving in and stopping 
a union worker/freight industry colli-
sion and understanding the importance 
of providing benefits to our hard work-
ers. 
Yesterday, at the Teamsters, I indi-
cated how important it is that workers 
have benefits, and the ability to go to 
the doctor. That is the fight that we 
must continue. I am glad it has been 
derailed, but we need to continue to 
fight to get a permanent solution for 
our workers. 
I rise today as well, Mr. Speaker, to 
introduce 
and 
acknowledge 
the 
SHIELD Act, to shield doctors and 
nurses 
and 
other 
reproductive 
healthcare providers from harassment, 
litigation, and draconian laws. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
this legislation that would protect 
pregnant people and the medical per-
sonnel 
who 
provide 
reproductive 
healthcare services to them and will 
prevent interference, restriction, and 
retaliation against doctors, nurses, 
nurse midwives, nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants, and others who 
evaluate, diagnose, advise, treat, or 
provide other services in order to pro-
tect them, to give healthcare, and to 
stop women from standing outside the 
door of doctors’ offices and not getting 
care. I ask my colleagues to support 
the SHIELD Act. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, these 
are the times that try men’s souls. 
We have heard so much in recent 
days about the raid by the FBI in Mar- 
a-Lago. I have continued to hear from 
FBI agents and former FBI agents. Re-
publicans on the Judiciary Committee 
have, as my friend JIM JORDAN has 
pointed out, received, I think, 14 com-
plaints from people within the FBI 
about very serious problems. I have 
had several that I have received per-
sonally that were not included in those 
14. I understand Senator GRASSLEY has 
also gotten some. 
There is a systemic problem at the 
FBI. Christopher Wray was appointed 
to clean up the FBI. As I told President 
Trump later on: You have asked me 
about a few of your appointments; I 
wish you would have asked me about 
that one, because I could have told you 
a great deal, going back to the days of 
Mueller as director of the FBI. Director 
Christopher Wray learned some of 
those techniques. 
Director Mueller, even going back as 
far as Boston, tried to keep two people 
who were innocent of the murder of 
which they were convicted—they were 
set up by FBI agents—and Director 
Mueller continued, even after it was 
clear they were innocent, to try to 
keep them from being released from 
prison. 
Then along came Comey. He has had 
serious issues with truthfulness and 
yet does a great job of trying to play 
the victim. 
I had one FBI agent, who had been 
around a long time, say: You remember 
back to the 1980s, 1990s, at the FBI? We 
were completely professional. If some-
one had a nonviolent background, we 
were just about doing our job. We 
would notify the—especially if we knew 
the person had a lawyer, we would no-
tify the lawyer that your client needs 
to appear, is being indicted or has been 
indicted, needs to appear at this or 
that jail at a certain time. And, of 
course, if the person didn’t arrive, they 
knew they would be picked up. But 
they were given a chance to volun-
tarily surrender. Normally, that went 
very well, quite professionally. 
But what we have seen arise with the 
Department of Justice and the FBI is 
absolutely disgusting. I mean, I was a 
law-and-order felony judge. I have sen-
tenced people for felonies, everything 
from probation to the death penalty. I 
know what it is to wrestle over the 
issue, presentence reports, evidence at 
sentencing, and what appropriate sen-
tences are.

We expected local, State, and Federal 
law enforcement that came before me 
to be professional, and they better not 
lie or there would be consequences and 
there were. 
But this FBI, this DOJ is so far out of 
control, and Christopher Wray took his 
appointment as Director—at a time we 
needed the FBI cleaned up—as a direc-
tive to sweep everything he could 
under the rug. 
FBI agents have told me, from dif-
ferent places in the country that I have 
talked to, you know: What Director 
Christopher Wray keeps telling us con-
stantly is nothing about being honest. 
Be truthful about everything you say 
and do. But his big line, they tell me, 
is ‘‘protect the FBI brand.’’ 
And they make clear, they say he 
makes clear, and they follow up by 
their actions making it clear, that if 
there is somebody in the FBI doing 
something wrong, you better not re-
port it to anyone but your supervisor. 
I am not going to get into some of 
these because I haven’t had an oppor-
tunity to properly go through them to 
exclude identifying information, but 
those that complained to their super-
visors that I have seen the complaints, 
they are retaliated against. 
So it becomes very clear to honest, 
honorable 
law 
enforcement 
people 
working at the FBI, at least many of 
them, that when Christopher Wray 
says, ‘‘protect the FBI brand,’’ he 
means don’t you dare report anybody 
anywhere except to your supervisor, 
and that way we can get rid of you, we 
can make your life miserable, we can 
get you out of the FBI, so it is only 
people who won’t complain about lies, 
dishonesty, corruption, because the 
message seems pretty clear: We want 
people that will help us convict the 
people we want convicted, whether 
they are guilty or not. 
I am not going to get into all of the 
complaints that have been provided to 
me, the information; but I want to con-
centrate on one issue since Mar-a- 
Lago, the raid there by the FBI, again, 
they jumped the gun. Never, ever be-
fore has a former President had their 
residence raided. And it is very clear 
that with Director Christopher Wray 
and Attorney General Merrick Gar-
land, here is the deal: If it is a sup-
porter of President Trump, let’s go 
after them, make their lives a living 
hell. Let’s send the message out far and 
wide, you better back off supporting 
that guy, that former President Donald 
Trump or we will come after you. We 
will come after your friends. 
Instead of doing what was done with 
people working with Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, who were given immu-
nity agreements that would even in-
clude stuff like, we just want to see 
your laptop, and here is the deal we 
will make with you. Instead of getting 
a search warrant, grabbing the laptop 
of Hillary Clinton’s assistants, they 
made a deal. We just want to look at 
your laptop, and here is our deal: We 
will not use anything we find in the 
laptop 
against 
Secretary 
Clinton, 
against you, against anybody. We just 
need to see what is there. That is all 
we are going to do. We are not going to 
copy it or anything, and we promise we 
won’t prosecute you. 
I have never, ever seen a deal like 
that. Who would make that kind of 
deal except corrupt people in the De-
partment of Justice and the FBI? 
Because what you do if you are law 
enforcement, you get the warrant, you 
seize the laptop, and if there is evi-
dence of crime on there, as you believe 
there is, then that can be used to pros-
ecute the people instead of giving them 
an immunity agreement that you will 
not come after them at all. 
There were incredible deals made to 
protect Secretary Clinton and the peo-
ple who worked for her and to make 
sure they had no reason to testify 
against their boss. Because typically 
law enforcement all over the country, 
all over the world, knows if you are 
going to make a case against somebody 
at the top, whether it is the mob, 
whether it is the State Department, 
wherever, you make a case against the 
people below, and you say: Okay. Here 
are 20 violations; you are looking at 5 
years, you are looking at 100 years. But 
we will make a deal, we will only pur-
sue this charge that carries a 2-year 
sentence if you will help us on the peo-
ple above you. And you work your way 
up the food chain. 
That is the way great prosecutions 
have occurred against mob organiza-
tions, and it works the same way with 
any organization, except that the DOJ 
and the FBI chose to treat conserv-
atives, chose to treat all of Donald 
Trump’s friends, people that might 
have information against him, they 
were all treated very differently be-
cause there are two types of justice. 
Justice is no longer wearing a blindfold 
in Washington, D.C. 
From some of the complaints I have 
seen, I used to think the problem was 
here at the national headquarters, but 
apparently it is not just the field office 
or the headquarters here because there 
has been so much corruption, it spread 
all over the country. 
So there is all the indignation from 
the FBI and the DOJ about documents 
that were held in Mar-a-Lago. Now, I 
haven’t talked to anybody with Presi-
dent Trump’s team, with President 
Trump. It has been months. And the 
last time I talked to him, he was just 
calling, surprised that I was running 
for Attorney General in Texas, and it 
was a very short conversation. So we 
hadn’t talked about any of this. But I 
understand his frustration because I 
have seen the way evidence was created 
to pursue two impeachments of Donald 
Trump. 
I have seen the evidence, at least 
some of it, of the way the FBI and the 
DOJ falsely convicted Senator Ted Ste-
vens immediately before his election. I 
think they tried him 2 weeks before his 
election, and he lost just by very little. 
Then he was exonerated when one FBI 
agent who believed in truth signed an 
affidavit establishing that there was 
exonerating evidence, exculpatory evi-
dence that they did not provide to Sen-
ator Stevens and that they forced a 
witness to say what he had made clear 
was not true, and they convicted him. 
That seems to be a pattern. These 
kinds of things appear to be going on in 
different places. Oh, yeah, they are 
convicting some guilty people, but it 
makes it very difficult to know which 
is which when you have an organiza-
tion that plays fast and loose with the 
rules and plays fast and loose with the 
truth. 
So you have got people who have 
made complaints, and just like the FBI 
agent who had a conscience and re-
ported the fraud in the prosecution of 
Ted Stevens by the Department of Jus-
tice and the FBI, he was run out of the 
FBI, and the one that was engaged in 
the fraud, according to the FBI, was re-
assigned and then promoted. 
How do you have a national law en-
forcement entity that keeps integrity 
when integrity is no longer the key 
word? Oh, yeah, I have heard Comey 
and others talk about integrity, that 
the FBI, the ‘‘I’’ stands for integrity. 
Not anymore. 
No. It is all about preserving the 
brand, which means you can’t allow 
any 
information 
about 
corruption 
within the FBI to get outside, or we 
will use our ability to be corrupt to 
come after you for filing or making a 
complaint or reporting dishonesty. 
Every American has a constitutional 
right to communicate with his or her, 
or whatever your pronoun is, your 
Member of Congress. It is a right. 
And not only that, it is a constitu-
tional right that those communica-
tions can be privileged and protected, 
which is why when William Jefferson, 
Congressman William Jefferson, who 
did have $90,000 of cold, hard cash in his 
freezer—and I read the affidavit that 
was used to get a warrant to search his 
congressional office—and there were 
people that were on TV saying, gee, 
there are people like GOHMERT that are 
saying they had no right to raid that 
office. 
Well, those individuals are just igno-
rant of the Constitution. But the D.C. 
Circuit Court of Appeals was not. And 
they made clear, look, even though the 
Department of Justice in that case— 
and I had no problem with him being 
convicted. It appeared to me from the 
affidavit, holy cow, if this is accurate, 
they didn’t need to raid his office. In 
fact, by raiding the office and violating 
the privilege, they put their case that 
was rock solid in jeopardy. 
I remember being an assistant dis-
trict attorney, right out of law school, 
ready to go pursue justice, and let’s get 
the bad guys. And it always helps to 
have somebody that has been around a 
while, say wait a minute, think about 
this. What you are proposing to do to 
get evidence, it may violate the Con-
stitution. It may not. But you have got

a rock solid case here. Why risk it 
being thrown out trying to make some 
point and get some little piece of evi-
dence you don’t need? You have got 
enough to convict. So don’t create a 
possible error pursuing evidence you 
don’t need. Just get the conviction. 
Don’t get into the murky areas that 
may reverse your case. You will get the 
conviction, and you will keep the con-
viction. It won’t be reversed on appeal. 
But they put that case at risk be-
cause all those years before—and I did 
happen to be in the room. It was the 
conference room of the Speaker. His 
legal 
team, 
House 
counsel, 
White 
House counsel came over, DOJ counsel 
came over, and there was a lot of fury 
because of what the FBI under Mueller 
did, raiding that office, because in the 
past if someone had a warrant, like to 
search a congressional office, well, the 
DOJ knew, FBI knew there is privi-
leged material in there. In fact, I am 
sure I am not the only one who has had 
FBI agents provide information about 
wrongdoing within the FBI. 
b 1715 
Well, when the Founders set up these 
three branches of government, as Jus-
tice Scalia once explained to some 
friends from my old town, the reason 
we have more freedom than any coun-
try ever in history—at least we used to 
have it—was because the Founders did 
not trust government. So they made it 
hard for any one of the three branches 
to abuse people and abuse their power. 
And the only way the Department of 
Justice—that was created and financed 
by Congress—the only way to keep 
them accountable—or the intel com-
munity—is to make sure Congress does 
proper oversight. And you can’t do 
proper oversight unless you are allowed 
to have people come to you privately 
and say, Here is the problem, and know 
that they are not going to have repris-
als. 
That is why we have the whistle-
blower laws that many are apparently 
using now. So the way it was done be-
forehand is you come to House counsel. 
We have a warrant. House counsel, who 
is familiar with the privilege of Con-
gress to keep certain things private 
and other things not, would then go 
through everything that was specified, 
because you have to have in the war-
rant, you have to state with particu-
larity the place to be searched, the 
things to be seized. 
They would go through those, and 
they would put aside anything that was 
privileged and then give the things 
that were not privileged that matched 
what was in the warrant, give that to 
DOJ. But Mueller wanted to send a 
message to everybody in Congress, 
Democrats and Republicans. I don’t 
care about your constitutional rights 
or privileges. We are going to go heavy- 
handed, and I am going to send a mes-
sage to every single Member of Con-
gress: You don’t mess with me, or I will 
come search your office. And I will 
send a message to every FBI agent: 
You better not complain to Members of 
Congress because I can go raid their of-
fice, and I can find out who you are, 
and I can destroy your lives as well. 
That was a message very clear. And 
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said, 
Wait a minute. So the DOJ says, okay, 
we will take the stuff from the Con-
gress Members’ office, and we will have 
some people that won’t be involved in 
the prosecution that work in our office. 
They will go through it and anything 
that is not privileged, they will go 
ahead and give that to the prosecutors. 
And the Circuit Court is going: You 
can’t do that in the same office. Come 
on. That has to be somebody different 
that makes sure that it is secure. 
And we saw the FBI, all these years 
later from that, basically doing the 
same thing with Mar-a-Lago. You have 
Presidential executive privilege. You 
have attorney-client privilege. Appar-
ently, that doesn’t mean much any-
more at the DOJ, but it still means 
something to those of us that care 
about the Constitution. 
And yet, they set up their own de-
partment to go through—we will decide 
what you can claim as privilege and 
what—no, you don’t get that right. 
So what do they do? They hurry 
through it. So they have already been 
through everything before the Court 
could appoint a special master. And 
from what we saw in Ted Stevens’ case 
and other cases, you can’t be sure stuff 
won’t disappear. 
Look at what we just found out. All 
these years later, going back 6 years, 
that the FBI has covered up for 6 years 
that they employed the Russian. The 
FBI was colluding with Russia. The 
DNC, the Hillary Clinton campaign, 
they were all colluding with Russia to 
try to destroy Donald Trump. That is 
why the FBI hired Danchenko. That is 
why the DNC and the Clinton campaign 
hired Christopher Steele. 
And what we are hearing on the news 
the last day or two is that at the time 
they went before a judge and swore an 
oath to keep getting the warrant to spy 
on the Trump campaign and on Presi-
dent Trump, they knew their basis was 
a lie. They committed fraud upon the 
FISA court. 
And apparently, there are people in 
the DOJ that don’t understand the F in 
FISA—that F word that is the first 
word in FISA is not what they appar-
ently think it is. It stands for foreign. 
And they committed a fraud upon the 
Court and got a warrant for the first 
time in the history of the country. 
They helped their political campaign 
by spying on a political opponent. Even 
the DOD, the Department of Defense 
got involved. They hired the professor. 
And, in fact, we had someone who was 
a whistleblower. He went and said, 
Look, there are hundreds of thousands 
of dollars being paid to this professor 
in London, and we got nothing in re-
turn for it. This is a problem. 
So what happened? They fired him 
because he found where the DOD was 
helping go after, at that time, can-
didate Trump. They fired him. He is 
still trying to get his job back. He 
hasn’t gotten justice yet. 
But how can people in America have 
any confidence in the Department of 
Justice when they think—when there 
are so many people, apparently, who 
think it is okay to go commit a fraud 
on the court even at the highest level 
of the DOJ and the FBI. It is not okay. 
Yes, every organization is composed 
of people who are human and make 
mistakes, but for goodness sakes, when 
you have top people who flaunt the law 
and think they are above the law, and 
that if they want to go after somebody, 
then they are Almighty God, and their 
judgment is tantamount. And if you 
ever report them, they are coming 
after you because they are God-like in 
their own minds. 
Look, the FISA court is being abused 
so badly, we know now—and I’ve men-
tioned before—but that Verizon order 
that was leaked, I couldn’t believe it. A 
judge signed that. Had the judge not 
read the Fourth Amendment? You have 
to describe particularly the place to be 
searched and what’s to be seized. 
And what the government, the FBI, 
the DOJ said is, you know what? FISA 
court, we need every bit of information 
this cell phone company has on every-
body. 
American, 
foreign—we 
don’t 
care. We need every bit of information 
they have on every single customer. 
And the judge looked at it and went, 
Oh, okay. They need every bit of infor-
mation that Verizon has on every sin-
gle customer. Sure, I will sign that. 
Where is the particularity? Where is 
the evidence that any of these people 
have committed a crime—or ‘‘prob-
ably’’ committed a crime? You have 
got to have probable cause. Where was 
that? 
And where is the indication that 
there was evidence in what was being 
seized to prosecute those people for 
committing—there 
wasn’t 
any. 
No, 
they just wanted everything on every-
body, and they used the FISA court to 
get it. 
When I saw that, I am going, oh, my 
gosh. I mean, I have signed so many 
warrants over the years as a judge—I 
have turned many down. Wait, you 
don’t have probable cause in here. You 
can’t just plead conclusions. You have 
to assert specific facts in your affidavit 
that supports the application for a war-
rant so that, as the judge, I can find 
there is probable cause a crime was 
committed and probable cause to be-
lieve there is evidence that I am going 
to specify they can be found at this 
specific location. Being abused like 
crazy. 
So here is a letter from—and this is 
from the attorney, Kurt Siuzdak. It is 
my understanding he is a former FBI 
agent. He sets out to Director Wray: 
Under 28 CFR Part 27, you are advised that 
an anonymous employee of the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation is making a protected 
disclosure to the United States Congress and 
House of Representatives.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7872 
September 15, 2022 
The anonymous employee is reporting to 
you and Congress that executives in the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation have been vio-
lating FBI security protocols that have been 
implemented to ensure the security of classi-
fied information. Since you have been Direc-
tor of the FBI, many Senior Executive Serv-
ice (SES) officials have been wearing their 
cell phones into SCIFs. 
That is the secure compartmen-
talized facilities. It is like a room that 
they can ensure is totally free. It can’t 
be bugged. It has not been bugged. 
There is nobody with any electronic de-
vices that could be hacked so that peo-
ple can listen. 
I asked one of our intelligence people 
one time about a show that I saw, a 
movie, where a cell phone company re-
quired everybody at meetings to take 
their battery out of the phone: Does 
that keep a phone from being com-
promised during a meeting? He said, 
no, because even if you take the bat-
tery out—which I don’t know how you 
do that with an Apple phone—but even 
if you take the battery out, there is an-
other residual power so that your in-
formation is there when you put it 
back in, that we could still get in and 
we can listen to you. We can access the 
camera. We can watch. 
That certainly didn’t make me feel 
very secure about things as long as 
there are phones around. And he said 
other countries are really good at 
hacking. There are some that are great 
at it. 
So if somebody has a phone in a 
meeting, we can listen, we can watch. 
So that is why you have a SCIF. And 
we have a couple of SCIFs here on Cap-
itol Hill. You can’t go in there—you 
can’t even get near being in the SCIF 
with a cell phone. No Member of Con-
gress is allowed. They are very strict. 
No Member is allowed to have a cell 
phone, a smartwatch—those kind of 
things. 
The letter goes on and points out 
that: 
These violations have occurred at the 
SCIFs (special compartmentalized informa-
tion facilities) in field offices and at a facil-
ity known as LX. 
The anonymous employee worked at LX 
and several field offices. The anonymous em-
ployee had visibility of counterterrorism, 
counterintelligence, and field office execu-
tives. Although all FBI personnel are prohib-
ited from bringing electronic devices into 
SCIFs, FBI Senior Executive Service per-
sonnel openly and notoriously wore phones 
into SCIFs in ways that have made it appar-
ent they were demonstrating their power and 
authority to subordinates. 
These executives would walk into and out 
of the SCIFs multiple times wearing their 
cell phones on their belts and never stop to 
secure the cell phone prior to entering the 
SCIFs. When the phone rang, some execu-
tives would exit the SCIF and answer the 
phone, but others would start talking on the 
phone prior to exiting the SCIFs. 
Depending on a particular cell phone’s set-
tings, 
apps, 
and 
vulnerabilities, 
eaves-
dropping using a cell phone’s microphones 
may be considered a trivial cyber hacking 
exploit for advanced persistent threat or hos-
tile nation-state actors. Some executives 
wore multiple holders which would indicate 
they were also wearing their personal cell 
phones in the SCIFs. 
As a result, FBI executives have willfully 
compromised the security of FBI SCIFs since 
your time you became Director and poten-
tially many years prior. 
Additionally, the anonymous individual is 
reporting that FBI executives who are in-
volved in preparing daily briefing materials 
for you or participating in FBI headquarters 
daily briefings have brought classified mate-
rials to their homes to ensure that they are 
prepared to answer questions for the next 
day’s briefings. 
b 1730 
Why, that is worse than what they 
are accusing President Trump of. 
Although certain executives may have cou-
rier cards that allow them to transport clas-
sified materials, the classified materials in 
question were certainly not properly pack-
aged, and the courier cards do not allow FBI 
executives to store classified material in 
their homes. 
The anonymous employee advised that al-
though the FBI is investigating individuals 
not currently employed by the FBI for mis-
handling of classified materials, the anony-
mous employees cannot recall a single FBI 
Senior Executive Service official who was 
even reprimanded for these violations unless 
it involved incidents in which the classified 
material was found in public. In contrast, 
DOJ has prosecuted non-SES FBI employees 
for mishandling classified information. 
One reason for the failure to hold FBI ex-
ecutives accountable is that field office secu-
rity officers generally report to the special 
agents in charge or assistant special agents 
in charge in the office. FBI special agents 
and employees do not stop these notorious 
security violations because reporting the 
misconduct of these executives would cer-
tainly result in retaliation and would be pro-
fessional suicide. 
Please note the DOJ OARM has determined 
that anonymous reports of serious mis-
conduct can be protected disclosures. Al-
though the Department of Justice Office of 
Attorney Recruitment Management has in 
section 5, subsection C of its procedures for 
FBI whistleblower reprisal claims brought 
pursuant to 28 C.F.R. of part 27 stated that it 
is not bound by any ‘‘case law of the U.S. 
Merit Systems Protection Board, the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and 
any other Federal court of appeals deciding a 
whistleblower appeal from the MSPB.’’ 
They have made clear they are above 
the courts and above Congress. They 
are above everything. They will do 
what they please. 
Wow. And they are in charge of jus-
tice. 
You should also be aware that one of your 
Office of General Counsel attorneys advised 
me that she would not accept 28 C.F.R. part 
27 disclosures because it wasn’t part of her 
current caseload. Under that standard, OGC 
has completely insulated you from receiving 
protected disclosures from outside attorneys 
and thwarted Federal whistleblower laws and 
regulations. 
Well, that is apparently because he is 
head of the FBI, and as head of the 
FBI, he is above the courts, and he is 
above Congress. He can do what he 
pleases. 
We saw that Merrick Garland, our 
Attorney General, issued an order to 
the FBI that they are not to contact 
any Member of Congress. So much for 
the Constitution and your constitu-
tional rights. I am the Attorney Gen-
eral, he is saying, and I can override 
the Constitution, the Supreme Court, 
court of appeals, and the President. I 
am God when it comes to you, is the 
message. We Americans have a serious 
problem with a Director and an AG 
who are acting like that. 
Because after that came out about 
saying there were phones especially in 
the Director’s and Deputy Director’s 
SCIF, the Director sent out their 
media person to say it is a lie, that 
there have not been any cell phones al-
lowed in or around the SCIF. Then that 
triggered a number of complaints and 
people coming forward to set out that 
the Deputy Director’s denial was a lie. 
Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much 
time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 21 minutes remaining. 
Mr. GOHMERT. I needed to know the 
time because I have to play by the 
rules. I can’t act like I am the Attor-
ney General or FBI Director and just 
ignore the rules and law. 
So here is this letter again: 
Pursuant to 28 C.F.R. part 27 and the FBI’s 
Dodson rule, you are advised that an anony-
mous individual from the FBI is making a 
protected disclosure. 
It goes on. This individual was an ex-
ecutive who recently worked at FBI 
headquarters. The person had work-re-
lated reasons for being in the Direc-
tor’s and Deputy Director’s office areas 
on the 7th floor of the Hoover Building. 
While working in the 7th floor SCIF 
areas, the individual observed numer-
ous security violations involving the 
presence of personal electronic devices 
such as cell phones, smartwatches, and 
wireless sports bands. The individual 
recently read that the FBI publicly de-
nied the security violations at FBI 
SCIFs and specific violations by Dep-
uty Director Abbate. 
The individual is reporting this issue 
because the FBI’s denial casts doubt 
upon the credibility of the FBI employ-
ees who made the initial disclosure re-
lated to Mr. Abbate. This individual 
advised that the SCIFed areas where 
Director Wray and Deputy Director 
Abbate currently worked had multiple 
people wearing or displaying elec-
tronics that are prohibited in the SCIF. 
In fact, the FBI has explicitly limited 
the smart bands and watches in non- 
SCIF areas because the devices pose 
such a serious security threat. 
There is a little more. But then there 
is another to Mr. Abbate: 
Last week, the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation issued a ‘‘categorical de-
nial’’ about your failure to follow prop-
er SCIF protocols to protect national 
security. 
Keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, these are the 
people who are condemning former President 
Donald Trump because they weren’t sure the 
padlock they said they had to add on top of 
the locks he had already was good enough. 
Frankly, if I were President Trump 
and I had seen and heard about wrong-
doing at the top of the FBI, and I had 
seen the gestapo tactics they have used 
to go after nonviolent people who used 
to have their lawyer get a call saying

that he needs to report at a certain 
time in a certain place and they would 
do it, he had seen on the news how they 
would leak information whether it is 
CNN or some other liberal media so 
that people could be there when they 
knock down the door or drug people 
out of bed in their underwear and took 
them outside—the FBI didn’t used to 
do that. Now, the gestapo used to do 
that. That is what they would do be-
cause they were about intimidation, 
threats, and torture if necessary. 
But when somebody is nonviolent, no 
criminal history, and they are obvi-
ously not a threat, you are going to 
bring a full SWAT team so you can 
drag them out of bed? 
One family reported that her 18-year- 
old daughter was grabbed by the hair 
and drug upstairs to show where some-
thing was. 
For heaven’s sake, what happened to 
the professionalism at the FBI and the 
Department of Justice? 
Anyway, this letter says: 
You also seem to have decided that ‘‘good 
of the Bureau’’ equates to the good of Paul 
Abbate. It does not. The FBI lied to the 
American people to protect you, which is 
shameful. 
By issuing an absolute denial of your mis-
conduct, you also implicitly claimed that 
the two individuals who reported the mis-
conduct made false statements. This asser-
tion is also false. Thinking back, you are 
certainly aware that many of your subordi-
nates saw you wearing the phone in the 
SCIF. Now, your subordinates are coming 
forward, and their reports are far more 
damning to you and Mr. Wray. 
You, Mr. Wray, and the employees on the 
7th floor violated national security because 
you were all too lazy to secure the devices. 
He put our most precious and most 
confidential secrets at risk because of 
his arrogance. 
When SSA Schoffstall—he is a special 
agent in charge out West—emailed you re-
questing that you rescind the reprisals by 
Salt Lake City’s SAC Dennis Rice—special 
agent in charge. Wray’s and your replies to 
Schoffstall were ‘‘deleted, not read.’’ 
They didn’t want to know about re-
prisals for doing his job and protecting 
the brand. 
This supervisor refused to allow his subor-
dinates to be pressured to lie, and you re-
fused to help him. 
That was what he did wrong. His sub-
ordinates were being pressured to sign 
a lie under oath that they knew was a 
lie, and they wouldn’t sign, which 
would be a crime to swear under oath 
to something you know is not true. 
They were being demanded to sign a lie 
under oath. They wouldn’t do it. When 
their 
Special 
Agent 
in 
Charge 
Schoffstall defended them and said: No, 
you can’t make my agents sign a state-
ment that they are telling you is a lie. 
Sure, we understand you want those 
things in there because you need them 
to have probable cause, but we are tell-
ing you they are not true. 
So, the supervisor was punished for 
protecting the honesty and integrity of 
his field agents. 
What do Director Wray and Deputy 
Director Abbate do about it? We don’t 
want to hear about it. We would delete 
it, and we didn’t read it because we 
don’t want to know about the pressure 
on agents in the field to lie on affida-
vits. 
Who is going to investigate that? Oh, 
the DOJ. The DOJ has a little group of 
lawyers. They will look into it. 
What a ridiculous system. They need 
oversight, and this Congress sure isn’t 
going to have oversight because they 
want them to keep coming up with 
stuff to go after Donald Trump. 
The letter goes on: 
This supervisor refused to allow his subor-
dinates to be pressured to lie, and you re-
fused to help. If you want to understand how 
that feels, just ask the media representative 
who issued the denials about your personal 
violations in the SCIF. 
Because somebody told that media 
rep to go out and lie and deny every-
thing. 
The employees of the FBI joined because 
they believe in its core values. They are held 
to the standard that every employee must be 
truthful and accountable. You have failed on 
both counts. You have mistaken your em-
ployees’ loyalty to the FBI as some mis-
guided loyalty to you. 
In the last week, many of your agents and 
employees have advised me that I will be 
‘‘killed’’ or, as one of your employees said, 
the FBI would issue me a one-way travel 
voucher off the 4th floor of a hotel balcony. 
How pathetic it is that your employees have 
so little faith that you can do the right thing 
that they would believe dissent against you 
is a life-threatening proposition. 
Before you issue any claim to mock the 
statement, be assured that the employees 
who suffered death threats from within the 
FBI in 2020 have filed protected disclosures 
with the U.S. Congress. They begged you for 
help, but you and Mr. Wray ignored their 
pleas. Their SAC refused to notify the in-
sider threat unit of the issue. Instead, the 
SAC opened a threat investigation at the 
field office level, but refused to assign an in-
vestigator to conduct the investigation. 
Your employees have abandoned you be-
cause you abandoned them. There is nothing 
more that you can do for the FBI, you have 
demonstrated your lack of honesty and ac-
countability. Please find a job that does not 
require either of those traits. 
b 1755 
Another letter that came after the 
denial, according to these people is 
that is an outright lie from the top 
floor of the FBI. 
The individuals have advised that they 
were associated with an FBI unit called De-
fensive Electronic Countermeasure Group, 
which is responsible for conducting elec-
tronic countermeasure sweeps in various FBI 
facilities. This individual or individuals was/ 
were involved in a sweep of the Director’s of-
fice and Deputy Director’s office, including 
the conference areas inside the Hoover 
Building’s 7th floor SCIFs. 
It is their job to check for the secu-
rity of these places. 
During the sweep, dozens of electronic sig-
nals, including WiFi and Bluetooth signals, 
were emanating from within the ‘‘SCIFed’’ 
area. FBI cell phones, personal cell phones, 
and 
high-technology 
smartwatches 
were 
present in the FBI SCIFs. 
According to the people who offi-
cially surveyed the SCIFs. 
There were phones on desks. It did not 
even appear that the director’s office em-
ployees were trying to hide the devices. The 
devices in the SCIF were the type that had 
cameras included within them. 
Meaning, they can be hacked, and if 
people know what they are doing, they 
can take pictures, they can see what is 
going on through the phone that was 
left in the secured location. So much 
for protecting things. At least that 
wasn’t the situation at Mar-a-Lago. 
The SCIFs on the 7th floor of the FBI Hoo-
ver Building in Washington, D.C., are, for all 
intents and purposes, compromised. This in-
cludes the whole Director’s and Deputy Di-
rector’s areas. 
They are the ones that are going to 
protect us from situations like a 
former President having documents. 
These areas are where the most significant 
threats and most important top secret infor-
mation in the United States are discussed. 
You and your executives have created one of 
the critical security threats to the United 
States. Because Director Wray and you work 
in this office area, there is no doubt that you 
both are aware of the violations. Please do 
not accuse your employees of lying because 
you cannot admit the truth. 
It appears that you, the executives, and 
the staff of the 7th floor of the FBI building 
have formed a conspiracy to violate security 
practices to protect national security simply 
because you are not disciplined enough to 
properly store your electronic devices. 
As time concludes, let me finish part 
of a disclosure regarding the Defensive 
Electronic Group that surveys these se-
curity SCIFs. This person said: 
I was responsible for Technical Surveil-
lance Countermeasures worldwide. Recently, 
I participated in an exam of the J. Edgar 
Hoover Building, specifically the conference 
room for the Deputy Director of the FBI. 
During the exam I observed dozens of strong 
Bluetooth signals. 
That is in the SCIF that is protected 
from Bluetooth signals or any WiFi. 
As I began looking for possible sources, I 
observed cell phones on desks and in use in-
side the SCIF. I had just begun looking for 
them when the chief security officer respon-
sible for that area shut me down. 
He was doing his job. He/she—what-
ever the pronouns are—was doing the 
job they were hired to do. Yet, they 
were shut down for doing it so that the 
Director or the Deputy Director’s area 
could remain completely unsecured be-
cause they didn’t want him to be re-
ported. 
He specifically directed me not to pursue it 
or take any action. As you know, cell phones 
are not permitted inside a SCIF. Based on 
the readings I observed, I believe every em-
ployee there was violating the cell phone 
policy. 
That is at the top of the FBI. The 
DOJ doesn’t appear to be concerned 
about security. If they were, they 
wouldn’t have hired a Putin-lackey to 
provide false information so they could 
get 
a 
fraudulent 
warrant—six 
of 
them—to pursue and spy on the Trump 
campaign. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

September 15, 2022 
DEVASTATION IN PAKISTAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
majority leader. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this is a devastating time for the peo-
ple of Pakistan. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to share this with 
my colleagues and to ensure that their 
story is in the public eye because it is 
a story that addresses devastation like 
you have never seen before. I guess the 
story that is so devastating is the 
600,000 women who are on the verge of 
giving birth in conditions that are so 
devastating. 
The week of September 2, members of 
the Congressional Pakistan Caucus 
made their way as quickly as they 
could to the rain-torn, flood-torn re-
gion of Pakistan. We arrived on Sun-
day morning and immediately were 
able to secure a transport into the 
flooded areas. 
As the government indicated, this is 
not overflowing rivers, this is sheer 
rain that generated into flooding. In 
the Sindh region, Balochistan, the 
southwestern region—sheer rain turned 
into floods that were unspeakable. 
The water was unspeakable, it was of 
biblical proportion. The size and the 
width and the depth was unspeakable. 
It was a monstrosity. We took an aer-
ial survey. You could not see land. It 
was only water as far as the eye could 
see. 
In fact, tragically and unfortunately, 
we could imagine that whole commu-
nities were covered with water, that 
bodies are yet unfound. Even though 
the death toll is upwards of 1200 to 1300, 
with one-third or more of those being 
children. Can you imagine seeing the 
video of the currents rushing and tear-
ing children away from desperate par-
ents’ hands or families being caught in 
the current and children being pulled 
away by the rushing waters? 
We saw, as was displayed by the gov-
ernment, whole buildings and hotels 
coming down to the ground. There were 
200 bridges destroyed and water going 
through those bridges. We could, of 
course, see that it was irreparable 
harm. Even as we were surveying we 
saw a bridge that was breached, which 
divided people that were on that one 
little line of bridge as their safety net 
because 
they 
were 
surrounded 
by 
water, and then they were separated 
because the bridge broke in half be-
cause the water was so powerful. 
In the midst of that, we got a report 
that military forces had to flood towns 
of 250,000 people. They had to flood 
towns so that a city of 1.1 million peo-
ple could survive. We landed in the city 
of Dadu, and there are now 400,000 
homeless 
people 
in 
Dadu. 
Over-
whelmed. There are 600,000-plus home-
less people in Pakistan. 
I know that America is a Nation that 
has always extended its generous arm. 
If there is ever a moment—as we have 
done 
around 
the 
world 
in 
earth-
quakes—Pakistan’s earthquake of 2005 
and floods of 2010—as we have done 
around the world when the nations 
around the world have fallen upon dis-
astrous times. 
As a Member of Congress, I went into 
that horrific tsunami that impacted 
Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, 
you could not recognize those nations. 
The tsunami had come and taken out 
all of the coastal land. People were 
drawn into the sea, and you never saw 
them again. Houses were destroyed. 
The United States joined with the 
United Nations and was there to help. 
The United States has helped when 
there have been issues of national 
health crisis, we have been there. We 
became the leading guardians of fight-
ing HIV/AIDS, particularly on the con-
tinent of Africa. 
I do want to applaud the Biden ad-
ministration on being the first donor of 
the United Nation’s call for help for 
Pakistan, $30 million. Just as we were 
leaving—after we had petitioned the 
Federal Government—they came with 
an extra $20 million. 
More importantly, as I left to go to 
Pakistan, 
writing 
President 
Biden 
about the issue of shelter and tents, 
the United States military dropped or 
delivered 300,000 tents on Wednesday or 
Thursday of last week to be delivered 
to homeless and helpless persons. 
The Pakistani-American community 
have been outstanding, working with 
consul generals across America and the 
Ambassador. They are now raising 
funds, upwards of millions of dollars. 
But it is not enough. 
First, Pakistan probably has $10 bil-
lion in damages and destruction, but 
that number has been characterized as 
low because the water has not been 
able to drain because there is no drain-
age. That means that that water not 
being able to drain that damage will be 
caused and go on and on and on. I am 
afraid of dengue fever, waterborne dis-
eases, hepatitis, malaria, with no medi-
cations. 
While we were there we met a family 
that had just been plucked out of the 
waters. Their dad had a kidney trans-
plant, who had not yet received his 
medicine—everything lost. We were 
able to press upon the military’s gen-
erosity and good heart to get him his 
medicine and get it to where he is—out 
in an area where I saw no medical fa-
cilities. 
I want the RECORD to know that even 
though this country is many miles 
away, we are connected by its demo-
cratic beginnings. This is the 75th an-
niversary of its independence. It has by 
and large had peaceful transfers of gov-
ernment, a frequent government, but a 
democratic government. The founding 
father, Dr. Jinnah, established this 
country—as India was established by 
Gandhi in its independence—that it 
should have as its form of government 
democracy. 
I am fearful of the loss of life and 
children and disease will set this coun-
try back for many, many, many years. 
Let me share with you this story. 
The hospital has nothing. Pakistani 
floods put pregnant women in danger. 
Just 2 days ago this article from the 
Guardian came out. A third of the 
country is under water, and a U.N. fund 
says almost 650,000 women in affected 
areas need maternity services. That 
should give you an amazing level of 
fear—650,000. 
b 1800 
I visit hospitals because I am an ad-
vocate for hospitals, particularly in 
rural areas. And they tell me, well, we 
have delivered 3,000 births in a month, 
and I applaud that. That is a high num-
ber here in the United States. 
But I want to say this again. The 
U.N. says almost 650,000 women in af-
fected areas need maternity services to 
have healthy babies. 
Crying, vomiting, and 8 months preg-
nant—I know that wives and Members 
of Congress, women Members of Con-
gress, women across America, can un-
derstand the fragility of a woman dur-
ing her pregnancy. The young woman 
walked in labor pains for an hour in 
search of an ambulance. She wasn’t 
driven. She wasn’t on a bicycle. She 
wasn’t on a cart. She wasn’t on any 
form of scooter, any form of transpor-
tation. 
When Naseeba, 23, eventually found 
one, she had to beg the driver to take 
her. Pakistan floods had left the roads 
damaged and gridlocked, making what 
is usually a 2-hour journey to the pro-
vincial capital of Quetta a punishing 
12-hour drive; 2 hours to 12 hours. 
She left her flood-ravaged home in 
Nasirabad district in Balochistan prov-
ince in the morning and reached 
Quetta at night. 
During this time, I didn’t know what 
has happening around me; struggling 
to speak. When I finally reached the 
hospital, the doctors said I would not 
survive if they didn’t operate imme-
diately. Complications with labor, in-
cluding severe high blood pressure, 
meant doctors had to rush to deliver 
the baby. 
I would venture to say that this was 
a circumstance of life and death. 
Complications with the labor contin-
ued. And Naseeba said she gave birth to 
a baby boy 2 days ago, but the doctors 
told her that the baby requires to be 
incubated, but there were no incuba-
tors available, so we had to take her 
baby to my mother’s place, she said. I 
haven’t seen my baby yet. 
We can only hope that that baby sur-
vived, and that the help at home might 
have helped that baby breathe. 
Naseeba is one of the thousands of 
pregnant women, according to the 
United Nations Population Fund, who 
will bear the brunt of the worst floods 
in Pakistan and are in desperate need 
of maternal health services. 
And so I will be asking USAID and 
the head of that agency, who I am very 
gratified, was visiting Pakistan as we 
were visiting—as we were leaving, 
USAID was coming on the ground. As

September 15, 2022 
we were there, we received a briefing 
from USAID, and the very schools that 
USAID, our humanitarian arm of the 
State Department, built in that region, 
became the shelters for people. But 
that means the children are not in 
school. 
More than a dozen women who were 
interviewed in this story, were preg-
nant, or had already given birth in the 
worst 
flood-affected 
provinces 
of 
Balochistan and Sindh, women who 
said they have been abandoned without 
healthcare, food, and clean drinking 
water to meet their nutritional needs. 
We should be very clear. A third of 
Pakistan is under water, with 1,400 
dead, most children, and 33 million 
people affected, as the country has 
been ravaged by monsoon-triggered 
floods, coming at a totally unique 
time. In our briefings, they said, we 
have dealt with monsoons. These are 
like we have never seen. 
The impact on climate change should 
not be lost. This is clear evidence of 
how stark it is. UNFPA said 73,000 
women were expected to give birth this 
month—that is this month of Sep-
tember—who need skilled birth attend-
ants, newborn care, and support. It es-
timates, as I said, that 650,000 pregnant 
women in flood-affected areas require 
maternal health. 
Again, people living in plastic tents 
or camps on roadsides, near flood 
waters, and the homes of millions of 
people have been swept away. 
It is well-known that the health fa-
cilities across Pakistan are affected; 
432 are fully damaged; 1,228 are par-
tially damaged. 
Another woman, Rubina, who is 8 
months pregnant, in this Guardian 
story, and currently lives in a tent on 
a roadside, said she had pregnancy-re-
lated complications that included body 
aches and anemia. She said medica-
tions prescribed by doctors were not 
available, and she could not afford to 
buy them from a private hospital. They 
did whatever they could for her, her 
husband and brother. 
They have lost their source of earn-
ings and cannot provide us with any-
thing else; and the government hos-
pital has nothing. 
This is the story of thousands. This is 
not a story that is going to end. It is a 
story that is going to continue. 
Another woman had delivered on her 
way as she was walking to the hospital, 
and the infant was brought into the 
hospital via ambulance, but the woman 
couldn’t come because of the high level 
of water. 
Many women could not even come to 
the hospital, and midwives had to be 
called. 
We are doing all that we can. 
And this is a call out to our Amer-
ican humanitarian agencies, as I indi-
cated. Healthcare is the most crucial, 
along with food, and it is clearly an ur-
gent emergency condition. 
One young woman left her home after 
it was submerged in flood water in the 
Sindh province. And as I said, many 
people are living in schools built by the 
United States. This young woman gave 
birth to a baby girl named Shamma, 
which means light. We get food some-
times, but not at other times. I am un-
able to feed my infant because I am so 
weak. And so, baby formula is needed 
because 
women 
are 
not 
able 
to 
breastfeed. 
Roshan, another displaced woman 
who had given birth a month ago: Ev-
eryone is falling sick here. I feel faint. 
I have constant headaches. Our chil-
dren do not have clothes. There is only 
one piece of cloth for my newborn that 
I wash every day to use again. 
And UNFPA has warned that many 
women and girls are at increased risk 
of gender-based violence as almost one 
million houses were damaged in the 
catastrophic floods. I am convinced 
that that is another crisis. 
As Samina, who took refuge, along 
with 
thousands 
of 
other 
pregnant 
women, in Larkana said, there can be 
no greater pain than having to leave 
your home. I cannot tell you how dif-
ficult it was to leave. I am expecting a 
baby soon, but in a state of homeless-
ness. 
The government is working very hard 
to try and reach these persons but, in 
the midst, they face a financial crisis 
which they are working very hard to 
try to cure with work with the World 
Bank and, of course, with the Inter-
national Monetary Fund. But it is not 
going to be enough. 
And so, our visit, we are grateful, 
highlighted the crisis which is being 
faced. It was a visit covered with a de-
sire to be as quick on humanitarian aid 
as we could, and to bring the story for-
ward as to what is transpiring. 
In addition, we wanted to make sure 
that those who could not get back to 
their province and are here in the 
United States could secure a tem-
porary protected status because of the 
devastation of their country. We hope, 
joined with Congresswoman YVETTE 
CLARKE, that our request will be given 
reasonable consideration. 
As I indicated, as I started, we are 
dealing 
with 
an 
extreme 
climate 
change, horrible exhibition of the dev-
astation that could come about. It is 
extreme. The reasons for the flooding 
are linked to climate change and the 
resulting extreme weather. 
It is important to note that Pakistan 
produces only about 1 percent of the 
pollution, the carbon footprint linked 
to global warming; while we, in the 
United States, produce 11 percent; 
China, 27 percent; India produces 6.6 
percent, and the EU, 6.4 percent. 
But researchers say the catastrophe 
probably started with unprecedented 
heat waves because, in April and May, 
temperatures reached above 104 degrees 
in Pakistan for sustained periods in 
many places in the region. 
In fact, when we were briefed by the 
head of the climate agency, they said 
that temperatures went up as high as 
127 degrees Fahrenheit. Those are kill-
ing temperatures. On one sweltering 
day in May, the city, Jacobabad, 
topped 123.8 degrees. This is not nor-
mal. This area is not accustomed to 
heat like this. And recorded as the hot-
test place on Earth was in Pakistan. 
The intense heat also melted glaciers 
in the northern mountainous regions. 
And now many would wonder, glaciers? 
Yes. 
One of the other places in the world 
where glaciers are are the mountains 
in Pakistan. And so when those gla-
ciers, those northern mountainous re-
gions, increasing the amount of water 
flowing into tributaries that eventu-
ally made their way into the Indus 
River, compounded by the rain—the 
Indus is Pakistan’s largest river and 
runs the country’s length, from north 
to south, feeding towns, cities, and 
large swatches of agricultural land 
along the way. 
But let me add something else be-
cause Pakistan is an agricultural coun-
try, and the largest percentage of work 
in Pakistan is agriculture. The region 
where the flooding took place was 
where they grew one of their most 
bountiful products, and that is wheat. 
The farmers managed to gather their 
wheat and to store them in their 
homes, preparing for the market, or 
preparing for next year. But the floods 
came and wiped away their homes and 
their food source and the moneys that 
they would get from selling. But even 
more devastating, this may go on for 
years because they lost their seeds. 
So imagine that: Mighty waters flow-
ing down from the glaciers, melting be-
cause of this unusual heat, this out-of- 
the-world heat; then rivers overflow, 
but then add to the monsoon or mon-
soons, and then, of course, the flooding 
that has taken away millions of homes, 
impacted 33 million people, and taken 
away their food. 
We, as Americans, have faced our lev-
els of disaster. Our heart goes out to 
the people in Eastern Illinois; St. 
Louis, Missouri; Eastern Kentucky; 
Central 
Mississippi; 
Dallas, 
Texas; 
Death Valley, California; and this does 
not include the thousand-year flood 
events that impacted, in recent years, 
New York and New Jersey. 
We should be well-aware of the im-
pact of climate change. And I am very 
gratified that I have seen my constitu-
ents in the energy industry face up to 
this and realize that the carbon foot-
print must come down, down, down. I 
want to continue to work with them as 
they recognize that it will be a disaster 
if we do not work, both nationally and 
internationally, on stopping the carbon 
footprint and addressing the question 
internationally and nationally of the 
question of climate change. 
The rains in Pakistan have resulted 
in unimaginable changes in the land-
scape. Reports are backed up by new 
images taken by NASA’s MODIS. Sat-
ellite sensors show the result of heavy 
rain and an overflowing Indus River 
that has formed a 62-mile lake in the 
Sindh province where there was farm-
land. In this region, the monsoon rain-
fall has been 500 percent over average.

Let me try to lay this out for you. I 
indicated the Indus River is the nat-
ural river. But the leaders of govern-
ment explained, it was not the Indus 
River that overflowed its banks and 
caused the damage miles away from its 
banks; though there are many Paki-
stanis who live on the bank because it 
is the source of their food, source of 
their income, source of their liveli-
hood. 
But what the NASA’s MODIS showed 
us is that an unnatural lake was cre-
ated by the huge monsoons, the gla-
ciers melting, and created an unnatu-
ral lake that formed a 62-mile lake in 
the Sindh province where there was 
farmland, so where there had not been 
any water before. 
b 1815 
They also told us that the area that 
we were in, the Sindh province, did not 
receive a lot of rain, which speaks to 
the reason why they had no drainage. 
They did not have a lot of rain. 
The issues of the day caused the 
Indus River to be an ocean. You could 
see no start and stop. Then, it caused a 
man-made lake to occur that would, in 
fact, be there enough of a time to, in 
fact, continue to be devastating. 
Let me give you some facts that have 
not been gone over. This began in mid- 
June 2022, at the beginning of the mon-
soon season, which, as I said, there 
have been monsoons, but these were a 
monstrosity, unbelievable proportions. 
Heavy rains began flooding areas of 
Pakistan. Estimates range from double 
to several times the normal monsoon 
rain. They were just sitting and wait-
ing. Is it going to end? Is it going to 
end? Mr. Speaker, 6.4 million estimated 
people requiring humanitarian assist-
ance—again, 33 million people affected: 
44 percent Sindh province, 28 percent 
Balochistan, 13 percent in Khyber, 50 
percent in Punjab. 
As of September 13, just shortly after 
we came and left, 1,396 people have 
been killed, and, of course, 12,278 people 
have been injured as a result of the 
flooding. We don’t know if people will 
die of their injuries. 
More than 900,000 livestock have been 
killed, and there are people today, 
right as we stand here, who are refus-
ing to leave because they have their 
livestock, and there is no place for 
them to go. 
Mr. Speaker, 3.1 million people have 
been displaced. I have already indi-
cated that there are hundreds of thou-
sands that are homeless—650,000 peo-
ple, women needing maternal services, 
on the verge of giving birth, but 70,000 
are giving birth this month. This is, 
without question, a challenge that far 
surpasses the capacity of the Pakistan 
Government, although willing, to be 
able to do this on their own. 
The climate minister told a public 
radio interview that an area the size of 
Colorado is now submerged, that 66 dis-
tricts, equivalent to a county, are un-
derwater. According to satellite im-
agery, the flooding has created, as I in-
dicated already, this huge lake. 
Pakistan is equipped with water 
pumps to respond to monsoons and hel-
icopters for rescue purposes, but there 
is no place to send the resources. 
Again, I do want to note that the 
Pakistani Government has been work-
ing with the resources they have—147 
camps for populations displaced by the 
floods. Cash assistance was being orga-
nized to give to the families. 
The Pakistani Government has allo-
cated $173 million to aid flood-affected 
people. On August 30, the United Na-
tions and the Government of Pakistan 
launched a joint flood response plan, 
and the United States, as I said, was 
the first to give the funding from all 
other countries. 
They gathered $160 million for food 
security assistance, agriculture, live-
stock, shelter, nonfood items, non-nu-
trition programs, primary health serv-
ices, water and sanitation, and shelter 
for displaced persons. It is not enough, 
and there are people that cannot be 
reached. 
Money is also coming from the var-
ious elected officials, like the Prime 
Minister, the Central Emergency Re-
sponse Fund, the World Bank, the 
Asian Development Bank, the Euro-
pean Commission’s department for Eu-
ropean Civil Protection, and UNICEF. 
Governments from around the world 
have made an effort to help, but I be-
lieve it is going to be important for the 
United States to raise its voice again. 
As I said, the United States has al-
ways been there, and I am very glad to 
say that 1.4 million pounds of USAID 
relief commodities were airlifted to 
Pakistan by CENTCOM, $4 million in 
dedicated aid from the U.S. Bureau for 
Humanitarian Assistance. 
As I indicated, 300,000 tents—30 mil-
lion had already been given on the very 
day, August 30, that the United Na-
tions asked for. CENTCOM has oper-
ated nine flights transporting USAID 
items, including approximately 30,000 
kitchen sets, 10,000 plastic tarps, 1,400 
rolls of plastic sheeting from USAID’s 
warehouse. 
Again, 300,000 tents after the Paki-
stan Caucus had engaged and worked 
with the administration that I am very 
glad to say came forward. Then an ad-
ditional $20 million in humanitarian 
assistance in response to the flooding 
was announced on September 9. 
I do thank, again, USAID Adminis-
trator 
Samantha 
Power, 
who 
an-
nounced this effort, and we hope that 
this will continue. 
As noted in The Washington Post, 
the ‘‘U.S. ramps up aid for Pakistan 
floods with military airlift.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the Washington Post article of Sep-
tember 9, 2022, and the article from the 
Guardian dealing with the plight of a 
pregnant woman. 
[FROM THE WASHINGTON POST, SEPT. 9, 2022] 
U.S. RAMPS UP AID FOR PAKISTAN FLOODS 
WITH MILITARY AIRLIFT 
DADU, PAKISTAN.—The United States is 
ramping up support for Pakistan and begin-
ning a days-long military airlift into the 
country as it struggles to battle devastating 
floods that are expected to take years to re-
cover from. 
The military began airlifting supplies into 
Pakistan this week as part of the additional 
$20 million the Biden administration is pro-
viding for humanitarian aid here, Samantha 
Power, the head of the U.S. Agency for Inter-
national Development, announced on Friday. 
The announcement comes as it is increas-
ingly clear that Pakistan is incapable of pro-
viding even the most basic relief to the more 
than 33 million people affected by the crisis. 
The majority of those who have fled their 
homes are living in makeshift shelters, and 
many report they are not receiving food, 
clean drinking water or medical attention. 
The airlift will establish a ‘‘beachhead’’ in-
side Pakistan’s flood zone, Power said during 
a visit to affected areas Thursday. She said 
the plan is to begin staging operations closer 
to those in need so humanitarian supplies 
can be distributed more efficiently. 
‘‘It may go beyond this, but for now we are 
looking at shelter supplies to accommodate 
300,000 people,’’ she said. She admitted the 
number is a small fraction of those affected, 
but hoped other countries would follow suit 
and move operations inside Sindh province, 
one of the worst hit areas. 
The airlift is expected to last just over a 
week with two to three U.S. C–17s—massive 
cargo planes—landing daily in Sukkur, a 
town in Sindh province nearly encircled by 
floodwaters. The planes will bring tens of 
thousands of pounds of tents, field rations 
and kitchen sets into the country. 
While a number of countries have pledged 
millions of dollars in humanitarian aid 
money to Pakistan, aid groups on the ground 
are struggling to source the materials they 
need and reach the worst-affected parts of 
the country. 
Floodwaters moving south are cutting off 
key roads and highways, turning towns into 
islands and blocking the delivery of aid. 
Power said she hopes the assistance will 
also help reset perceptions of the United 
States in Pakistan. 
‘‘I think during the war in Afghanistan, 
there was an impression among some Paki-
stanis that the U.S. saw Pakistan only 
through the prism of Afghanistan,’’ she said. 
‘‘Hopefully this is a chance through this co-
operation [with the Pakistani government] 
to strengthen the relationship between the 
two countries.’’ 
U.S.-Pakistan relations have gone through 
periods of intense strain, despite decades- 
long humanitarian and military ties that 
predate the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. 
The enmity that many Pakistanis feel to-
ward the United States was clearly visible 
earlier this year when former Pakistani lead-
er Imran Khan began to strengthen his base 
of support by claiming his ouster was part of 
a U.S.-backed conspiracy. 
Although anti-Americanism remains a pop-
ular rallying cry in Pakistan, the govern-
ment led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, 
who replaced Khan, has moved to improve 
relations with the United States. 
The U.S. military’s top commander, Army 
Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla, visited Pakistan 
in August and acknowledged the country’s 
‘‘commendable efforts in fight against ter-
rorism’’ and its ‘‘efforts [to promote] re-
gional peace and stability,’’ according to a 
Pakistani military statement. 
The visit came shortly after the killing of 
Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of alQaeda, in 
a U.S. drone attack on his Kabul residence. 
The Taliban condemned the attack and ac-
cused Pakistan of allowing the United States 
to use its airspace to fly drones over Afghan-
istan. Pakistani authorities refuted the 
Taliban’s allegations. 
‘‘The partnership that we continue to deep-
en builds on years of cooperation between

our two peoples and between our two coun-
tries,’’ Power said at a news conference in 
Islamabad Friday. 
During Power’s visit to the heart of Paki-
stan’s flood zone, she asked local officials 
and families affected by the floods to esti-
mate the disaster’s long-term economic ef-
fects, in particular those linked to the loss of 
crops, livestock and infrastructure. 
It is clear that recovery from these his-
toric floods will require a concerted effort by 
the donor community and international fi-
nancial institutions for the coming years,’’ 
Power said. The support announced Friday, 
she continued, ‘‘is another mark of our long- 
standing commitment to the Pakistani peo-
ple.’’ 
[From the Guardian, Sept. 13, 2022] 
‘THE HOSPITAL HAS NOTHING’: PAKISTAN’S 
FLOODS PUT PREGNANT WOMEN IN DANGER 
A third of the country is under water and 
a UN fund says almost 650,000 women in af-
fected areas need maternity services. 
Crying, vomiting and eight months preg-
nant, the young woman walked in labour 
pains for an hour in search of an ambulance. 
When Naseeba Ameerullah, 23, eventually 
found one, she had to beg the driver to take 
her. Pakistan’s floods had left the roads 
damaged and gridlocked, making what is 
usually a two-hour journey to the provincial 
capital of Quetta a punishing, 12-hour drive. 
She left her flood-ravaged home in the 
Naseerabad district in Balochistan province 
in the morning and reached Quetta at night. 
‘‘During this time, I didn’t know what was 
happening around me,’’ said Ameerullah, 
struggling to speak. ‘‘When I finally reached 
the hospital, the doctors said I would not 
survive if they didn’t operate immediately.’’ 
Complications with the labour, including 
severe high blood pressure, meant doctors 
had to rush to deliver the baby. 
‘‘I gave birth to a baby boy two days ago 
but the doctors told us that the baby re-
quires to be incubated but there were no in-
cubators available so we had to take my 
baby to my mother’s place. I haven’t seen 
my baby yet,’’ she said. 
Ameerullah is one of the thousands of 
pregnant women, according to the United 
Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), who will 
bear the brunt of the worst floods in Paki-
stan and are in desperate need of maternal 
health services. 
The Guardian interviewed more than a 
dozen women who were either pregnant or 
had already given birth in the worst flood-af-
fected provinces of Balochistan and Sindh; 
women who said they have been abandoned 
without healthcare, food and clean drinking 
water to meet their nutritional needs. 
A third of Pakistan is under water, with at 
least 1,400 dead and more than 33 million 
people affected, as the country has been rav-
aged by monsoon-triggered floods washing 
away bridges, roads, livestock and people. 
UNFPA said 73,000 women were expected to 
give birth this month who would need skilled 
birth attendants, newborn care, and support. 
It estimates that almost 650,000 pregnant 
women in flood-affected areas require mater-
nal health services to ensure a safe preg-
nancy and childbirth. 
The floods have brought other health dan-
gers as well, such as a rise in diseases that 
affect young children. 
On a drive from Larkana to Dadu districts 
in 
Sindh 
province 
to 
Jaffarabad 
and 
Naseerabad districts in Balochistan, people 
could be seen living in plastic tents or camps 
on roadsides near the flood waters because 
the homes of millions of people had been 
swept away. 
Across Pakistan, more than 1,460 health fa-
cilities are affected, of which 432 are fully 
damaged and 1,028 are partially damaged and 
access to health facilities, healthcare work-
ers, and essential medicines and medical sup-
plies is limited, according to the World 
Health Organization. 
Rubina, a woman who is eight months 
pregnant and currently lives in a tent on a 
roadside in Jaffarabad, said she had preg-
nancy-related complications that included 
body aches and anaemia. 
She said medications prescribed by doctors 
were not available and she could not afford 
to buy them from a private hospital. 
‘‘My husband and brother did whatever was 
possible in their capacity. They have lost 
their source of earnings and cannot provide 
us with anything else and the government 
hospital in Jaffarabad has nothing,’’ said 
Rubina. 
Dr Sultan Ahmed Lehri, the medical super-
intendent of Bolan medical complex hospital 
in Quetta, said there had always been nutri-
tional deficiencies in pregnant women in 
many districts in Balochistan, and the exist-
ing situation would get worse because of the 
floods. 
‘‘If steps are not taken by the government 
this can turn into a huge crisis. The govern-
ment needs to work on this issue on a war 
footing and reach out to women and the 
broader population,’’ said Lehri 
He added: ‘‘We are witnessing heavy men-
tal toll and trauma of the floods on women 
as well. We need to treat that as well.’’ 
Haseena, another pregnant woman who 
lives in a tent close to Rubina, said she re-
quired blood because she was anaemic and 
that there were many others like her. 
‘‘We don’t get any medicine here and food 
so how can we expect to get blood trans-
fusions? We drink water from the rivers 
where animals are dead,’’ she said. 
And while thousands of men and women 
live in tents on the roadside, there are no 
toilets. 
‘‘This a tragedy which we can’t even talk 
about,’’ Haseena said. 
Dr Imran Baloch, a medical superintendent 
in Jaffarabad, said a lot of women gave birth 
in cars and on roads, and some on the way to 
the hospital because the roads were broken, 
making the journey much longer. There were 
also cases of premature deliveries. 
‘‘A woman had delivered on the way as she 
was walking to the hospital and the infant 
was brought to the hospital via ambulance 
but the woman couldn’t come because of the 
high level of water. Many women could not 
even come to the hospital and midwives had 
to be called. We are doing what we can.’’ 
An official in Balochistan, requesting ano-
nymity, said: ‘‘We have seen a shortage of 
medicines in many flood-affected regions, 
but I fear it may get worse if not tackled 
soon and it will affect women, children and 
the entire population.’’ 
The situation is almost the same in Sindh 
as in Balochistan. Durnaz Soz Ali, 22, left her 
house after it was submerged in floodwater 
in Qambar Shahdadkot in Sindh province. 
Ali, who now lives in Larkana in a school 
with hundreds of displaced people, said: ‘‘I 
was nine months pregnant and even in my 
pregnant state, I carried some of the belong-
ings and walked for hours.’’ 
Ali gave birth to a baby girl and named her 
Shamma, which means light. ‘‘We get food 
sometimes but not at other times. I am un-
able to feed my infant because I am weak.’’ 
Roshan, another displaced woman from 
Qambar Shahdadkot who had given birth a 
month ago in Larkana, said: ‘‘Everyone is 
falling sick here. I feel faint and have con-
stant headaches. Our children do not have 
clothes. There is only one piece of cloth for 
my newborn that I wash every day to use 
again.’’ 
UNFP A has warned that many women and 
girls are at increased risk of gender-based vi-
olence as almost 1 million houses were dam-
aged in the catastrophic floods. 
Samina, in Sindh province, who took ref-
uge along with thousands of other pregnant 
women in Larkana, said: ‘‘There can be no 
greater pain than having to leave your home. 
I can not tell you how difficult it was to 
leave. I am expecting a baby soon but in a 
state of homelessness.’’ 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me show you 
what people are facing and how people 
are struggling, and this is, as someone 
would say, with your own eyes. 
These little, small pieces here, those 
are human beings. This was their ref-
uge. This is water. This is water as far 
as the eye can see. They were making 
a life, barely, on a bridge. That was the 
only dry land. 
I can see they were on both sides, but 
they were able to get notice to run on 
this side so that they could be to-
gether, but they are stranded as this 
water breaks the bridge. It breaks the 
bridge. Water as far as the eye can see. 
This is what we saw. These are not 
little bushes in a lake. These are the 
tops of trees, the green that you see. 
Most of the land is covered. Some peo-
ple are stranded on these little patches 
of land. It looks like a beautiful, blue 
ocean, no land, and the fear of what is 
under this massive ocean. 
As I said earlier, there are pumps in 
normal times because there is no nor-
mal draining, but there is absolutely 
no ability to deal with something as 
massive as this. It is speculated that it 
will not come down for another 6 
months—stagnant water, disease, rag-
ing across Pakistan. 
This is just to let us look at a little 
bit of dry land in Dadu, working with 
the military, giving out food items to 
an elderly woman without food re-
sources and a little child looking up, 
babies in hands who are obviously in 
need of resources. 
It was an emotional time for the 
Pakistan Caucus and the Members who 
were there showing our love and affec-
tion because we want people to see the 
leadership that has worked to establish 
dry land and to try and work without 
resources for their community. 
The face of this little one tells it all. 
There are no schools. There is not 
much food, and there is not much hous-
ing. You could not have a dry eye in 
watching the conditions of our fellow 
human beings. 
We gave out food, but we gave out 
little lollipops to the children. I will 
tell you, they were clamoring for that 
more than anything else. But that is 
what I think is our biggest concern, be-
tween mothers having provisions for 
giving birth and feeding these little 
ones. 
I asked one little boy, does he want 
to go to school. There are no schools in 
that region. The schools that, as I said, 
were built by USAID were, in fact, used 
to ensure that there is shelter. We need 
more tents. We need more healthcare. 
It was interesting. The heat was exten-
sive and intensive while we were there. 
In my conversations, it was so good 
to be able to maybe not speak with lan-
guage that we both understood but

with the gesture of welcoming and ap-
preciating their plight as we were giv-
ing out food gifts to people who had 
nothing. 
It is a moment in history that I did 
not want our colleagues to miss, and it 
is a recognition that we have work to 
do. I wanted our colleagues to help me 
and to help us find a way to be con-
structive, so I used a number of $10 bil-
lion. 
We have gone way beyond that, as I 
indicated. The economic impact of the 
floods is now estimated to be at least 
$30 billion as of September 13, 2022— 
just the difference from when we went 
at the beginning of September of $10 
billion and even as we were in meet-
ings, all the government officials were 
surmising that it had to be more. You 
can’t displace 33 million and it is only 
$10 billion. An estimated 2 billion of 
crops and livestock could be lost due to 
flooding. 
b 1830 
Remember what I said. The region is 
a lifeline for Pakistan and for their 
product that they might be able to pro-
vide to other destinations. They lost 30 
percent of their rice crop and 70 per-
cent of their cotton crop, the country’s 
third largest export, making up 11.8 
percent of the country’s total export. 
That is income; that is opportunity. 
Ten percent of the sugarcane, lost. Es-
timates show that 800 million in textile 
exports would be lost, 3.6 million acres 
of crops have been affected, according 
to Pakistan authorities, and 735,000 
livestock have perished. These are 
numbers coming from Pakistan. 
Food is still needed. This is going to 
be a long, long journey. It is difficult 
to see this, but let me try and bring 
this to the attention of my colleagues. 
The red area says 4 million children 
are under 5 years old, and this red that 
you can see shows that these are se-
verely impacted areas. This takes up a 
very large part of the country. Seven 
hundred thousand people 65 and older 
are impacted. Five hundred thousand 
women are currently pregnant. Those 
numbers have gone up, I know. 
Mr. Speaker, I also include in the 
RECORD
the Pakistan Floods Report 
from September 2022. 
[From SKT Welfare, Sept. 2022] 
PAKISTAN FLOODS REPORT 
According to the government of Pakistan, 
a third of the country—equivalent to an area 
the size of the UK—is under water, in what 
the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres 
has called a ‘‘climate catastrophe’’. Whole 
villages have been cut off, with rescuers 
struggling to reach them. At least 1,300 peo-
ple have been killed and 12,703 injured. 
The people of Pakistan are in dire need of 
food, clean water, makeshift shelter and non- 
food items such as hygiene kits. SKT Welfare 
is on the ground, trying its best to reach 
those affected by the floods. 
More than half a million more houses in 
Pakistan were reported damaged or de-
stroyed in the past week, with the National 
Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) re-
porting more than 1.17 million damaged 
houses and nearly 566,000 destroyed houses as 
of 8 September. By nearly all available 
metrics, Sindh has been most affected by the 
heavy rains and flooding that have swept the 
country this monsoon season—particularly 
notable given that Sindh and Balochistan 
are historically drought prone areas. Nearly 
88 per cent of all damaged or destroyed 
houses—over 1.52 million houses—are in 
Sindh, and the province has also recorded 
the highest number of human casualties: 577 
people killed and 8,321 people injured, out of 
a total of nearly 1,400 deaths and more than 
12,700 injuries, including at least 496 children 
killed and nearly 4,000 children injured 
across 
Pakistan. 
Gender-based 
violence 
(GBV) as well as child protection and other 
protection concerns have reportedly more 
than doubled since the pre-monsoon period, 
according to the Protection Sector. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let 
me draw upon these final efforts and 
words so that you can know that now, 
after we have come back, the clarion 
call of crisis is out. 
‘‘U.N. chief calls for massive help as 
Pakistan puts flood losses at $30 bil-
lion.’’ 
The U.N. Secretary General called for 
massive help as he visited the country 
last Friday. RECORD monsoon rains and 
glacier melt created this catastrophe. 
He is now calling on the international 
community, and we do need it. The 
country is enormously dependent on 
our help. It has been, in many in-
stances, helpful during the Afghan 
evacuation of recent time, and most 
people are unaware of the military 
lives lost of the Pakistani military in 
fighting terrorism. 
The very fact that this dam has been 
seen by NASA, this lake, shows that 
this damage is going to be far reaching. 
Pakistan must reach out to the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, the World 
Bank, to be able to address this trag-
edy. 
My friends, this is not normal. If I 
can leave you with anything here, it is 
that we are, in fact, our brothers’ and 
sisters’ keeper and that as we see the 
clear evidence of a climate catas-
trophe, a mountain of horror, unspeak-
able devastation, it brings your mind 
back to the floods of the Biblical 
times. 
As we stand here today, children are 
not rescued, and 33 million people are 
in the eye of the disaster. Again, we 
are waiting, tragically, for the poten-
tial of massive disease that will shut 
Pakistan down. 
I cannot conclude without acknowl-
edging my great appreciation to the 
Pakistani-American community dias-
pora, some of whom traveled to Paki-
stan. The doctors, businesspersons, and 
people preparing now to take huge 
amounts of goods or dollars to be able 
to help. 
But as I speak about that, let me tell 
you what UNICEF has said. With 1.1 
million houses washed away and vital 
infrastructure 
destroyed, 
such 
as 
schools, UNICEF’s representative in 
Pakistan, Mr. Fadil, explained that 
18,000 schools have been destroyed and 
thousands of schools are now fully 
shuttered. That means children who 
have lost education for 2 years are also 
losing learning opportunities. 
These are the things that cannot be 
fixed immediately, nor can they be 
fixed with only emergency help. 
That is why I ask for the following: 
One, a major focus and research on dis-
secting the climate catastrophe that 
occurred that would generate the kinds 
of monsoons that caused 33 million 
people to be displaced. The State of 
Texas is about 29 million. That would 
mean the wiping out of an entire State, 
33 million displaced. There are towns 
that are not as large as 650,000. Equal 
that to the women that are pregnant 
without medical care. 
We can all imagine and know what 
1,300 dead are and more possibly being 
found. And we can also understand 
when the Army Chief of Staff reminds 
us in his story of the mother who came 
holding the infant that was hungry and 
said: ‘‘Here, I cannot feed my baby.’’ 
The government is fearful of a food 
security crisis. I have already said to 
you that cotton is gone, wheat is gone, 
income is gone, and therefore what is 
next. 
This is what we need. International 
funding that will be complemented by 
Pakistani funding from the Pakistani 
diaspora. I believe we need a massive 
infusion of tents, the quality of which 
the United States has begun to bring 
and drop into Karachi. More need to 
come. I also believe that food goods are 
going to have to be airlifted into hard- 
to-reach areas and into the camps that 
have been established. 
Then, of course, I am begging for the 
international medical community, the 
World Health Organization, to airlift 
medical facilities into the region. They 
have got to set them up on levels of dry 
land, with the ability to treat water-
borne diseases and the separate abili-
ties to help deliver babies and take 
care of the elderly. 
My friends, I have tried to provide a 
reason for us to come together. Paki-
stan is still in danger. Flooding may 
take up to 6 months, and we were even 
told that there may be more rains com-
ing. 
We know what happened to the peo-
ple of Kentucky. We watched the dev-
astation of their story. We don’t take 
lightly what can happen in difficult 
times. We realize that people have suf-
fered all over the world. 
With my own eyes and those of my 
colleagues, I documented that Paki-
stan is suffering. Oh, it is a country far 
away, but I know the capacity and the 
heart of the American people. I know 
the effectiveness of the United States 
military and the effectiveness of our 
own humanitarian aid and the State 
Department, USAID, and I know the 
compassion of President Biden and the 
administration. Let us work together 
with the United States Congress. 
I thank the chair of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and the chair of the 
Committee on Homeland Security for 
their 
contributing 
efforts, 
and, 
of 
course, the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs as we look at collaborative ways 
to be of help.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7879 
September 15, 2022 
I thank my colleagues, the bipartisan 
Pakistan Caucus and the Members of 
the Senate who likewise have been ad-
vocates for the region. This is South-
east Asia, a very important region. 
Pakistan has to be able to be stood up. 
The death toll cannot increase, and the 
agony of the people just cannot con-
tinue. 
Join me in my efforts to provide 
more resources, healthcare, food, hous-
ing, tents, and the care of yet-born ba-
bies and the restoration of the land. 
That is being a good neighbor, a good 
Samaritan. As a Nation, the United 
States has always been a problem-solv-
er. 
I thank my colleagues for listening, 
and I thank the Pakistani diaspora for 
their heart. Yes, we went because our 
hearts were torn with grief. 
With everything we gave to the peo-
ple, we also wanted to give them hope 
that America was there to be a friend. 
As I spoke and my words were inter-
preted, I said: We are here from the 
United States Congress, but we are 
Americans. When the word ‘‘America’’ 
was said, the people applauded and 
smiled. Maybe the only words that 
they grasped was: America was here to 
help. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for lis-
tening, and I know and feel that we 
will gather together and provide the 
comfort and resources needed by the 
people of Pakistan. 
Mr. Speaker, on September 6, 2022, I re-
turned from a congressional fact finding mis-
sion to the areas most impacted by the dev-
astating floods in Pakistan. 
I have seen the devastation and human suf-
fering firsthand, and I want to clarify that Con-
gress must act and be proactive in matters re-
lated to climate change, including both in the 
United States and abroad. 
The Jackson Lee CODEL conducted a sur-
vey of the impacted area by air and visited 
food aid stations and victims. 
The support provided by the United States 
will be essential to the recovery effort, which 
will likely take many years. An important form 
of assistance to Pakistan today is the award-
ing of Temporary Protected Status to Paki-
stanis in the United States, which is a tem-
porary immigration status provided to nationals 
of specifically designated countries that are 
confronting an ongoing armed conflict, envi-
ronmental disaster, or extraordinary and tem-
porary conditions. 
This is why I lead a letter to the Secretary 
of Homeland Security requesting Temporary 
Protected Status (TPS) for Pakistanis in the 
United States, allowing them to remain while 
the nation and the region recover from this 
tragedy. 
Congress created Temporary Protected Sta-
tus (TPS) in the Immigration Act of 1990. It is 
a temporary immigration status provided to na-
tionals of specifically designated countries that 
are confronting an ongoing armed conflict, en-
vironmental disaster, or extraordinary and tem-
porary conditions. 
The events in Pakistan are the very defini-
tion of why TPS was created. As the world 
finds its footing to learn to adapt to the rapid 
and extreme changes in climate, we must not 
look abroad and say that would not happen in 
the United States—we should never forget 
Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Harvey, or Maria. 
The reasons for the flooding are linked to 
climate change and the resulting extreme 
weather. It is important to note that Pakistan 
produces only about one percent of the pollu-
tion linked to global warming, while the United 
States produces 11 percent, China 27 percent, 
India produces 6.6 percent, and the EU 6.4 
percent of total emissions. 
Researchers say the catastrophe probably 
started with unprecedented heatwaves. In 
April and May, temperatures reached above 
104 degrees for sustained periods in many 
places in the region. On one sweltering day in 
May, the city of Jacobabad topped 123.8 de-
grees. This is not normal. This area is not ac-
customed to heat like this, and the recorded 
as the hottest place on Earth was in Pakistan. 
The intense heat also melted glaciers in the 
northern mountainous regions, increasing the 
amount of water flowing into tributaries that 
eventually make their way into the Indus 
River. The Indus is Pakistan’s largest river and 
runs the country’s length from north to south, 
feeding towns, cities, and large swathes of ag-
ricultural land along the way. 
It is not clear exactly how much excess gla-
cial melt has flowed into rivers this year, but 
scientists visited some high-altitude glaciated 
regions in July and noticed high flows and 
muddy water in the Hunza River, which feeds 
into the Indus. 
People across the United States are deeply 
saddened by the devastating loss of life, liveli-
hoods, and homes throughout Pakistan. In the 
United States, over the last five weeks, we 
have experienced five 1,000-year flood events 
impacting communities in every region of the 
nation. 
Unfortunately, many Americans can relate to 
the pain and loss the people of Pakistan are 
experiencing. There have been six 1,000-year 
occurrences in the United States over five 
weeks, causing flood events in Eastern Illinois, 
St. Louis, Missouri, Eastern Kentucky, Central 
Mississippi, Dallas, Texas, and Death Valley, 
California, and this does not include the 1,000- 
year flood events that impacted New York and 
New Jersey last year. 
The United States responded that the Paki-
stani government’s request for assistance was 
the right thing to do and for the right reasons. 
Climate change is not a one-nation issue—it is 
a global threat that will touch every life with 
pain if we do not remain steadfast to change 
and adapt to the new normal of extreme 
weather. 
The consistency of extreme weather dem-
onstrates these changes over the last several 
years should not be seen as temporary. 
Weather is not just what happens right in front 
of you; it is also about what is happening hun-
dreds and sometimes thousands of miles 
away from where we are standing. 
The rains in Pakistan have resulted in un-
imaginable changes in the landscape. Reports 
backup by new images taken by NASA’s 
MODIS satellite sensor shows the results of 
heavy rain and an overflowing Indus River that 
has formed a 62-mile lake in the Sindh Prov-
ince where there was farmland. In this region, 
the monsoon rainfall has been five hundred 
percent above average amounts. 
The United States remains steadfast in its 
support for affected communities throughout 
Pakistan. In addition to the $30 million in ur-
gently needed humanitarian assistance an-
nounced today, the United States also pro-
vided over $1.1 million in grants and project 
support earlier this month to ensure direct 
service reaches those communities most im-
pacted and to help mitigate and prevent the 
effects of future floods. The massive loss of 
crops and displacement of people puts the re-
gion at risk of famine if we do not act. 
My trip to Pakistan was an opportunity to 
convey our nation’s resolve to stand by the 
people of Pakistan as they recover from the 
flooding and to gather knowledge that will in-
form the Committee on Homeland Security on 
the factors related to this extreme weather 
event that is most relevant to the flooding 
events we are seeing occurring across the na-
tion with greater frequency. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my 
time.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who harmonized the 
world with seasons and kindness, sow-
ing and reaping, color and fragrance, 
we praise Your loving Name. 
Lord, strengthen our Senators to do 
their part in fulfilling Your purposes 
for this land we love. Be for our law-
makers a refuge and a shelter from 
life’s storms. Give them the wisdom to 
find in Your word a lamp for their feet 
and a light for their path. Provide 
them also with the resolve to walk in 
that light and follow Your guidance. In 
Your compassion, free them from the 
cares that deplete their trust in You. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Sarah A. L. 
Merriam, of Connecticut, to be United 
States Circuit Judge for the Second 
Circuit. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader. 
RAILWAY LABOR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last night, as most Americans were in 
bed asleep, freight rail companies and 
unions representing tens of thousands 
of workers secured a tentative agree-
ment that will keep the trains running 
on time and keep our economy moving. 
And the best part is that union leader-
ship representing tens of thousands of 
railway workers, who have worked 
themselves to the bone over the course 
of the pandemic, seem to have secured 
the higher pay and better working con-
ditions for their members. Railway 
workers have earned that pay and 
those benefits through blood, sweat, 
and tears, and I hope it will make it 
easier for other workers in future nego-
tiations to secure stronger benefits. 
This is exactly the sort of outcome 
that will keep our economy going, our 
supply chains running, and, most im-
portantly, our workers well-taken care 
of. The episode is a reminder of an ev-
ergreen truth that people underappre-
ciate even now: Workers are what 
make the wheels of our economy turn— 
in this case, literally. 
I want to thank President Biden and 
Secretary Walsh, who was steadfast 
and dedicated, and in a word that we 
have used for our Senate caucus, he 
persisted and persisted and persisted. I 
want to thank every single union rep-
resentative and railworker who nego-
tiated in good faith to reach this out-
come. 
RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
Madam President, now I have a few 
short remarks to say on marriage 
equality. 
Negotiators have been meeting prac-
tically every single day. Senate nego-
tiators, 
Democrat 
and 
Republican, 
have been meeting practically every 
single day this week to find a path for-
ward. There will be a meeting later 
today between both sides, and I look 
forward to seeing what progress Repub-
licans make to reach the magic number 
of 10. The onus is right now on our Re-
publican colleagues to demonstrate 
they are serious about passing mar-
riage equality into law. Every single 
Democrat is for it, but, of course, we 
need 60 votes. 
Let me be clear. My No. 1 priority is 
to pass legislation. It is an issue that 
will have profound consequences for 
millions of Americans in same-sex 
marriages and who identify as LGBTQ. 
To downplay this issue, to let it pass 
by or to act as if we can put it off for 
another time is not the right thing to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4628 
September 15, 2022 
do. We should do it now. That is why 
we are so eager to get 10 Republicans 
to support the bill. 
And across the street from here, we 
have all heard Justice Clarence Thom-
as and his fellow MAGA Republican 
Justices are surely waiting for the 
chance to one day follow through on 
his threat—Justice Thomas’s threat to 
drag same-sex marriage rights back 
under the spotlight of the Supreme 
Court. That thought should send a 
shiver down all of our spines. 
So I want to thank my colleagues, 
from Senators BALDWIN to SINEMA to 
COLLINS
and others, for continuing 
their talks. I am glad to give them the 
space to lead these negotiations be-
cause this needs to be done and done 
right. But for the sake of tens of mil-
lions of Americans, we need to get this 
done, and I hope we have 10 Repub-
licans who are willing to raise their 
hands and push this process forward. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, finally on judges, 
it was another productive week here on 
the Senate floor when it comes to con-
firming more judicial nominees. On 
Monday, we completed the confirma-
tion process for Salvador Mendoza to 
sit on the Ninth Circuit. Then we con-
firmed Lara Montecalvo to sit on the 
First Circuit. And later this morning, 
we will vote to confirm Sarah Merriam 
to be on the Second Circuit. 
We also will return to the nomina-
tion of Arianna Freeman to the Third 
Circuit as soon as possible. 
That brings our total for the month 
of September to five circuit court 
judges, and we now have confirmed 
more than 80 judicial nominees to the 
Federal bench. On numerous occasions, 
it has been with bipartisan votes, and I 
want to thank my Republican col-
league who joined us in voting for 
these fine nominees. 
To the Committee on the Judiciary, 
Senator DURBIN, and all of my col-
leagues, I say great work. Let’s keep 
going. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. This week’s infla-
tion report confirmed what working 
people across this country know all too 
well: The costs of feeding a family and 
keeping the lights on have skyrocketed 
more quickly this past year than at 
any time since the wake of the Carter 
administration. 
A year and a half of crippling run-
away inflation is the most important 
story to the American people every sin-
gle day. The media have grown some-
what numb to month after month of 8 
and 9 percent inflation, but working 
Americans have not had the luxury of 
growing numb. The pain gets worse 
every single time they have to fill a 
shopping cart or pay their credit card 
bill. 
One mother of young sons in my 
hometown of Louisville put it this way: 
My grocery bill has [gone] up a lot. It’s ter-
rible right now. I have to be really strategic 
on how I plan out the whole month to make 
sure we have enough money. 
Of course, Kentuckians aren’t the 
only ones in this predicament. In Ne-
vada, an office worker recently told re-
porters: 
I’ve not been buying a lot of things because 
I can’t afford it. I’m like, ‘‘The kids don’t 
need juice for school anymore. We’ll just do 
water.’’ 
In Arizona, so many families are hav-
ing to make tough choices at the gro-
cery store, many are accepting charity 
to keep food on the table. 
According to an employee of one food 
bank in Phoenix: 
The impact we are seeing day in and day 
out continues to go up. The families are 
stressed. 
And who can blame them? Food infla-
tion in America is at more than a four- 
decade high. Bread is 16.2 percent more 
expensive than it was a year ago. Milk 
is up 17 percent. Flour is up 23.3 per-
cent, and eggs are going for nearly 40 
percent more. 
Week after week, feeding a family 
has become a stressful proposition for 
millions of Americans, and every extra 
dollar spent on groceries is one fewer 
to spare for soaring electricity bills. 
In the suburbs of Las Vegas, resi-
dents have commiserated over the as-
tronomical cost of keeping their homes 
cool in the summer. One neighborhood 
message board reads like this: 
My bill for this month will be $574 . . . it’s 
insane. 
Yes, ours was $800 for June. 
In Arizona, a restaurant worker 
didn’t mince words about scraping to-
gether enough to keep the lights and 
air-conditioning on: 
If I didn’t have roommates, I wouldn’t be 
able to make it on the salary that I have. 
Overall, inflation in Phoenix and At-
lanta is way, way higher than even the 
sky-high national average. The coun-
try as a whole is still grappling with 
inflation over 8 percent, but Phoenix 
has seen a staggering 13 percent infla-
tion in just the last year, and Atlanta 
has seen nearly 12 percent. 
Of course, for working Americans in 
some other States, the most acute 
emergency is not the cost of summer 
cooling but, rather, the cost of winter 
heating. 
In places like New Hampshire and 
Vermont where many homes burn heat-
ing oil, this important price is up more 
than 91 percent since President Biden 
took office. 
And in every corner of the country, 
one of the biggest collective headaches 
facing working families with young 
kids is the rising cost of back-to-school 
shopping lists. 
According to one working mother in 
Pennsylvania, she had to take items 
like a backpack for her preschooler out 
of her shopping cart in the checkout 
line: 
It’s been at least 20 years since I have had 
to pull back to this extent. This is a new and 
humbling experience for me as an adult. 
American families are facing math 
problems that just don’t add up. 
Meanwhile, the same Washington 
Democrats who got them into this 
mess spent Tuesday celebrating having 
rammed through, on a party-line vote, 
a bill that does nothing to help them 
solve it: hundreds of billions of dollars 
in new spending, just as working fami-
lies are having the hardest time in dec-
ades making ends meet at home; hun-
dreds of billions of taxpayer dollars 
that wouldn’t even accomplish Demo-
crats’ own underlying radical climate 
goals, let alone the false claims of ‘‘in-
flation reduction’’ on the cover. 
So our economy continues to hand 
working families a raw deal. But the 
same day this latest awful inflation re-
port was published, Washington Demo-
crats went to a concert at the White 
House 
and 
celebrated—celebrated— 
their economic policies. 
How much more out of touch can you 
get? 
The Democrats’ giant inflationary 
spiral is costing the average American 
household 460 extra dollars every single 
month just to buy the same things 
they bought last year. President Biden 
and his government have imposed a si-
lent Democratic inflation tax of $460 
every single month. 
In Kentucky, the average household 
has to pay $608 more a month—well 
over $7,000 more a year—just to stay 
where they were when President Biden 
was sworn in. 
Americans’ real wages—their pur-
chasing power—has plummeted since 
this all-Democratic government was 
sworn in. 
And the Democrats response? Print 
and spend hundreds of billions more, 
make Americans without bachelor’s de-
grees pay off the graduate school debt 
of doctors and lawyers, and throw 
themselves a party on the White House 
lawn. 
Our colleagues across the aisle cre-
ated this human catastrophe. This run-
away inflation was a policy choice by 
Democrats, and they aren’t even trying 
to stop it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

September 15, 2022 
this week, and they weren’t good. In-
flation was even higher than expected. 
It was very clear that soaring prices 
are likely to continue for quite a while, 
but as usual, it doesn’t seem to concern 
the Democrats one bit. 
The President was asked Tuesday if 
he was concerned about August’s even- 
worse-than-expected inflation report. 
His answer? ‘‘No, I’m not.’’ 
It was just one more tone-deaf mo-
ment for the President and the Demo-
crats. 
On Tuesday, the President and the 
Democrats 
gathered 
at 
the 
White 
House to congratulate themselves for 
having passed their so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act, a bill that will do noth-
ing—nothing—to reduce inflation. That 
is not just my opinion. That was the 
conclusion of the nonpartisan Penn 
Wharton Budget Model and of the Dem-
ocrat chairman of the Senate Budget 
Committee, who referred to the bill as 
the 
‘‘so-called 
Inflation 
Reduction 
Act’’ on the Senate floor while admit-
ting it would do nothing to solve our 
Nation’s inflation crisis. 
But that didn’t stop the Democrats 
from celebrating yesterday. For most 
of us, of course, it is difficult to under-
stand what there was to celebrate. 
Leaving aside the issue of the 40-year- 
high inflation, we already know that 
the bill will also fall short in another 
respect—on deficit reduction. 
The Democrats’ claims that the bill 
would provide meaningful deficit re-
duction were always somewhat dubi-
ous, but even granting the Democrats’ 
rosiest assumptions, President Biden 
wiped out any deficit reduction when 
he announced his massive student loan 
giveaway 8 days—8 days—after the In-
flation Reduction Act was signed into 
law. 
So no inflation reduction, no deficit 
reduction. Oh, one other thing: The In-
flation Reduction Act will drive up en-
ergy bills for Americans. 
So the question is: What was there to 
celebrate? 
Well, for the Democrats, the Infla-
tion Reduction Act marked a chance to 
finally push through some of their far- 
left, Green New Deal fantasies, things 
like electric vehicle tax credits to help 
wealthy Americans buy electric cars, 
more than $60 billion—$60 billion—for 
‘‘environmental justice priorities,’’ in-
cluding $1.9 billion for things like iden-
tifying gaps in tree canopy coverage, 
and the list goes on. So I think the 
Democrats are pretty satisfied with 
themselves 
over 
finally 
jamming 
through elements of their Green New 
Deal agenda. 
Then, of course, they succeeded in ex-
tending increased ObamaCare subsidies 
that will push Americans off of private 
healthcare plans and into government- 
run care. 
Then—then—there are the tax hikes. 
The current Democratic leader once 
said, ‘‘You don’t want to take money 
out of the economy when the economy 
is shrinking,’’ like it has in the pre-
vious two quarters. But those days are 
gone. For the Democrats, raising taxes 
has become an article of faith. 
And it goes far beyond raising money 
to help pay for their Big Government 
spending. The Democrats believe rais-
ing taxes on corporations and well-off 
Americans is good in and of itself, even 
if those tax hikes have a negative ef-
fect on less well-off Americans and the 
economy. The tax hikes that the 
Democrats have included in their so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act will, in-
deed, have a negative effect on our 
economy and on the hard-working 
Americans who help support it. The 
Democrats’ tax hikes on businesses 
will result in slower growth, lower 
wages, and thousands of fewer jobs, and 
the Democrats’ tax hikes on conven-
tional energy will result in higher en-
ergy prices for working families. 
In addition to raising taxes, the 
other main way the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act raises revenue is by increasing 
IRS audits and placing new burdens on 
taxpayers. 
The Democrats’ bill contains a whop-
ping $80 billion in increased funding for 
the IRS. That is an increase in funding 
which represents six times the annual 
budget of the IRS today. More than 
half of those funds, or $46 billion, are 
earmarked for increased IRS enforce-
ment. Just 4 percent is for improving 
customer service, which should tell you 
all you need to know about where the 
Democrats’ real priorities lie. 
The bill would provide for the hiring 
of as many as 87,000 new employees, 
which would more than double the cur-
rent size of the Agency and make the 
IRS—make the IRS, if you can believe 
this—larger than Customs and Border 
Protection and the U.S. Coast Guard 
put together, combined. 
In the lead-up to the passage of the 
Democrats’ bill, the Biden administra-
tion put out a statement declaring that 
the money for IRS enforcement would 
not go to the increased audits of house-
holds making less than $400,000. Be-
cause we had reason to doubt that that 
would be the case, the Republicans put 
forward an amendment to the bill to 
prevent the IRS from using its new 
money 
to 
audit 
those 
Americans. 
Every Democrat—every single Demo-
crat—voted against the amendment. 
So, I guess, the Democrats are happy 
to oppose more IRS audits of middle- 
class Americans in theory, but they 
don’t want to cut off the possibility of 
those audits in practice if they end up 
needing them to help fund their Green 
New Deal spending. 
I don’t need to tell anyone that the 
IRS is notorious for mishandling sen-
sitive taxpayer data. As recently as 
this month, we learned that the IRS 
had inadvertently posted confidential 
taxpayer data of around 120,000 individ-
uals on its website—private taxpayer 
information that was available to the 
general public. 
Then, of course, there was last year’s 
leak, or hack, of confidential taxpayer 
information that was shared with the 
left-leaning ProPublica and was used 
to advance a partisan agenda for 
which, I might add, neither the IRS nor 
the Biden administration has provided 
any accountability. 
Then there was the infamous tar-
geting of conservative groups for extra 
scrutiny under the Obama IRS, and the 
list goes on. 
I haven’t even discussed the IRS’s 
record of grossly underperforming— 
some would say nonexistent—customer 
service. During the 2022 tax season, 
just 10 percent of taxpayers’ calls—10 
percent of taxpayers’ calls—to the IRS 
were answered by an IRS employee. 
What we need to be doing is holding 
the IRS accountable, not setting tens 
of thousands of new IRS agents loose 
on taxpayers’ accounts. 
Earlier this week, I joined my Repub-
lican colleagues on the Senate Finance 
Committee to introduce legislation to 
prevent the IRS from using its new 
funding to audit American workers or 
small business owners earning less 
than $400,000 per year. 
I also introduced a bill this week, 
along with Senator COLLINS, to im-
prove taxpayer service at the IRS. Our 
legislation, called the Increase Reliable 
Services Now Act, would prevent the 
IRS from hiring new employees for en-
forcement until customer service at 
the IRS had reached a more acceptable 
level. It is unacceptable—unaccept-
able—that taxpayers have a 1 in 10 
chance of receiving assistance when 
calling the IRS, and the Agency should 
not be allowed to increase enforcement 
hires until it has achieved at least a 
basic level of customer service. 
So we have 87,000 new employees, 
which is double—double—the size of 
the current IRS workforce, and we 
have $80 billion, which is six times the 
current annual budget of the IRS, with 
a specific focus: going after taxpayers 
in this country to try and get, raise— 
whatever—more revenue to fund the 
Democrats’ Big Government fantasies. 
At the same time, 1 in 10 taxpayers is 
getting his calls returned at the IRS. 
I will continue to work to increase 
IRS accountability and prevent hard- 
working 
Americans 
from 
being 
squeezed to fund Democrats’ Green 
New Deal spending. 
Like the $1.9 trillion American Res-
cue Plan spending spree that came be-
fore it—which, I would add, helped 
plunge our country into our current in-
flation crisis—the Inflation Reduction 
Act is a bad deal for the American peo-
ple, and all of the self-congratulatory 
White House parties in the world aren’t 
going to change that basic funda-
mental fact. 
Americans are experiencing serious 
economic hardship, and Democrats are 
doing nothing to help. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4630 
September 15, 2022 
we have a bit of a reprieve, but we still 
have a threat. 
Since 2019, railroads and unions have 
been negotiating a new contract. Two 
months ago, President Biden appro-
priately appointed members of what is 
called 
the 
Presidential 
Emergency 
Board. This Board recommended the 
largest pay increase in industry his-
tory at 24 percent, in addition to an an-
nual bonus and healthcare changes. 
President Biden promised to be the 
‘‘most pro-union president’’ in history, 
but 
even 
President 
Biden’s 
rec-
ommendations 
weren’t 
enough 
for 
these unions. A few unions continued 
to hold out and, in fact, took us to the 
verge of a nationwide strike. 
A railroad strike would really plunge 
us back into the supply chain issues 
that have just now started to some-
what improve. These trains that would 
be stopped actually carry the food we 
eat, the gas for our tanks, and the en-
ergy that heats our homes. 
Already, I am hearing from grain ele-
vator operators in my State that they 
are having trouble transporting their 
grain. Hazardous cargo, like the chlo-
rine cities need to purify drinking 
water, stopped moving earlier this 
week. Amtrak has canceled long-dis-
tance routes. Maybe they are going to 
be up and running now, but at least 
they were getting ready to stop. 
But what I just described is the tip of 
the iceberg unless these unions agree 
to a long-term deal. The last thing we 
need is for grain shipments to grind to 
a halt right as farmers are going to the 
fields to harvest their grain. Iowa corn 
and soybeans can’t feed the world if 
they are stuck on the farm or in the 
local elevator. 
That is why I cosponsored Senator 
BURR’s joint resolution to prevent all 
of this. The resolution would mandate 
that both sides adopt the recommenda-
tions of President Biden’s emergency 
Board. Then, of course, if we pass that, 
the trains would keep running. 
We are just learning about a ten-
tative deal that would let unions back 
away from the cliff. If they don’t, then 
Congress must step in and pass the 
joint resolution to keep our economy 
going. The alternative is unacceptable. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

E-CIGARETTES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Sep-
tember 9, 2021, over a year ago, was 
supposed to be a historic day in Amer-
ica’s efforts to stop the purveyors of 
candy- and fruit-flavored e-cigarettes 
from preying on America’s kids. Sep-
tember 9, 2021, was the deadline, and it 
was set by a Federal judge for the U.S. 
Food and Drug Administration to fi-
nally—finally—clear 
its 
enormous 
backlog of applications from e-ciga-
rette companies seeking to sell their 
products in America. 
Companies that can prove that their 
vaping products are, in fact, ‘‘appro-
priate for the protection of public 
health,’’ they can go ahead and sell 
their products legally, but e-cigarette 
products can’t meet that standard. 
They can’t demonstrate a benefit to 
public health. Vaping, as we know, is 
dangerous and addictive, and these 
companies, like the tobacco companies 
of years gone by, are preying on our 
children. 
FDA had a legal mandate to ban 
these products from U.S. markets on 
September 9, 2021, but the Food and 
Drug Administration failed to meet the 
deadline—not by 1 day, not by 1 week, 
not even by 1 month. Last Friday 
marked the 1-year anniversary of the 
FDA’s failure to meet this Federal 
court order. 
As of today, the FDA has completed 
reviews of about half of these e-ciga-
rette products that represent a large 
share of the market. As a result of 
FDA’s inaction, dangerous, kid-friend-
ly e-cigarettes remain available on 
store shelves without FDA review or 
authorization. The cops are not on the 
beat. 
There are consequences to this ac-
tion. The Truth Initiative is a non-
profit consortium of health groups that 
aims to protect young people from 
using tobacco. It estimates that, in the 
year since the FDA missed the court- 
ordered 
deadline 
to 
approve 
or 
reject e-cigarette applications, nearly 
21⁄2
million kids in America started 
using vaping products. Many of these 
young people will go on to develop nic-
otine addictions, with serious harm to 
their health. That is the human cost of 
this FDA failure. 
Now the FDA says: Well, we might be 
able to finish this by 2023, 2 years after 
the Federal court-ordered date. And 
that is not the only deadline the FDA 
has blown when it comes to protecting 
kids from nicotine. After parents and 
public health groups demanded the 
FDA take action against candy-fla-
vored, nicotine-spiked e-cigarettes, the 
vaping industry came out with a 
brandnew miracle product designed to 
evade FDA jurisdiction: synthetic nico-
tine. Products like Puff Bar are incred-
ibly popular with middle and high 
school students. These new synthetic 
nicotine products include all the health 
dangers 
of 
traditional 
e-cigarettes, 
none of the regulation. When Congress 
learned 
about 
this 
loophole, 
we 
changed the law to say that the FDA 
had jurisdiction over synthetic nico-
tine products. 
To make matters worse, even when 
the FDA does review a product and 
issues a denial, many e-cigarette com-
panies just ignore them. It has reached 
a point that they are not viewed seri-
ously. The No. 1 regulator of food and 
drugs in America, when it comes to 
protecting our kids from these deadly, 
addictive products, isn’t viewed seri-
ously. 
The FDA has the legal right and the 
legal authority to do so. They can pull 
these products off the shelves tomor-
row. Yet, with respect to illegal e-ciga-
rettes, they do nothing—nothing. 
Look, I understand they are under-
staffed. 
I 
understand 
they 
are 
underresourced. FDA is not currently 
authorized to collect user fees for 
e-cigarettes, as it does for so many 
other products. And Congress fails to 
appropriate the funds many times that 
they need. 
These are real problems, but they do 
not absolve the FDA of its repeated 
failure to effectively regulate e-ciga-
rettes. I am at my wits’ end when FDA 
continues to miss these court-ordered 
deadlines, fails to enforce orders, and 
shows a lack of urgency when it comes 
to vaping products. 
Last week, I asked Health and 
Human Services Secretary Becerra to 
step in. If FDA cannot or will not do its 
job, then it is time for the lead Agency, 
Health and Human Services, to take a 
more active role. The FDA cannot con-
tinue to let unscrupulous e-cigarette 
companies flout the law and put their 
own profits ahead of the health of our 
kids. This has to stop. 
DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 
Mr. President, on a related matter, 
Congress has a big decision to make in 
the next few weeks. Every 5 years, Con-
gress must reauthorize FDA user fee 
programs. These programs authorize 
FDA to collect user fees from compa-
nies they oversee: prescription drug 
companies, medical device companies. 
These fees help provide the funding 
that FDA needs for staff. 
In fact, almost half of their funding 
comes from user fees. But we shouldn’t 
settle for a clean authorization of FDA 
user fees. We should give FDA the au-
thority to collect user fees from e-ciga-
rette companies, and we should provide 
FDA with new authority to protect 
America’s health by better regulating 
the dietary supplement industry. 
I want to thank the members of the 
Senate HELP Committee, especially 
its chairman, Senator PATTY MURRAY, 
for including my proposal for better 
regulation of dietary supplements in 
the committee-passed bill. 
But I fear this commonsense proposal 
may be lost in the sauce in the closing 
days of this fiscal year. 
Many people are surprised to learn 
that today dietary supplement compa-
nies are not even required to register 
their products with the FDA. They 
aren’t required to tell the FDA even 
the ingredients of their products. 
If you are going to put a product on 
the shelf in America, most Americans 
walking into that drugstore or that vi-
tamin shop believe that there has been

some government review of the prod-
uct, some inspection, some standards. 
Not the case. When it comes to pre-
scription drugs, they have to be proven 
to be safe and effective. Not so for die-
tary supplements. These products can 
hit the shelves and make outrageous 
claims and not be regulated in any 
way, like prescription drugs. 
What our bill says is that each of the 
companies selling these products has to 
register with the FDA the name of the 
product and the ingredients in the 
product. So if something goes wrong 
and people start getting sick, we at 
least have the most basic information 
to protect Americans. 
The FDA is one of the most impor-
tant Agencies in the Federal Govern-
ment. It has fallen on hard times. It is 
there to protect the health of families 
across the country, especially our chil-
dren. Whether it is dietary supple-
ments or tobacco or e-cigarettes, we 
need to make sure the FDA not only 
has the tools for the job but uses them. 
CONFIRMATION OF SARAH A.L. MERRIAM 
Mr. President, today, the Senate will 
vote to confirm Judge Sarah Merriam 
to serve on the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals. 
Judge Merriam was confirmed last 
year as a U.S. District Court Judge for 
the District of Connecticut. She re-
ceived a bipartisan vote on the Senate 
floor, which reflects not only her quali-
fications, but her impartiality as well. 
Prior to her appointment to the dis-
trict court, Judge Merriam served as a 
U.S. magistrate judge for the District 
of Connecticut from 2015 to 2021. 
Throughout her time on the Federal 
bench, Judge Merriam has presided 
over hundreds of matters, including 
five trials that proceeded to final judg-
ment. 
This significant judicial experience 
has 
undoubtedly 
prepared 
Judge 
Merriam to serve on the Second Cir-
cuit. 
Judge Merriam also has extensive ex-
perience in Federal court as an advo-
cate. For the bulk of her career as a 
practicing attorney, she served as an 
assistant 
Federal 
defender, 
rep-
resenting clients who could not other-
wise afford adequate legal representa-
tion. 
Notably, 24 former Federal prosecu-
tors in Connecticut—including three 
former U.S. attorneys appointed by 
Presidents of both political parties— 
support Judge Merriam’s nomination 
to the Second Circuit. 
This broad, bipartisan support is a 
testament 
to 
her 
fairness 
and 
evenhandedness, both as a jurist and as 
an advocate. 
The American Bar Association unani-
mously rated Judge Merriam ‘‘well 
qualified’’ to serve on the Second Cir-
cuit, and she has the strong support of 
Senators BLUMENTHAL and MURPHY. 
Judge Merriam has shown that she 
has the qualifications, experience, and 
fidelity to the rule of law needed to ad-
minister justice on the Second Circuit. 
I will be supporting her confirmation 
and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO VANESSA VALDIVIA 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
today because today is a bittersweet 
day for me. I rise to recognize and ex-
press my gratitude for the outstanding 
work of Vanessa Valdivia, who has 
served as my communications director 
since my first day here in the Senate. 
I speak for everybody in my office 
when I say we are going to miss her. 
But I am also proud. Next week, she 
will begin work at the White House as 
Special Assistant to the President and 
as Press Secretary to the First Lady. I 
have no doubt that she will do great 
things in her new role. 
Since our first days in the Russell 
basement, in an office I had when I was 
transitioning, Vanessa has brought her 
incredible experience, her unique per-
sonality, and her tremendous passion 
to the job in helping me communicate 
our work to the people of California. 
From my maiden speech here on the 
Senate floor, during the depths of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, to crisscrossing 
the State on an infrastructure listen-
ing tour as we were negotiating the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
here in Washington, to ensuring that 
Californians 
were 
consistently 
in-
formed of the historic progress that we 
have made in this Congress, Vanessa 
has been a key leader in my office and 
an adviser to me. 
She is a California native and is the 
proud daughter of Mexican-Nicaraguan 
immigrants. Now, some of you may re-
member some of my remarks during 
the confirmation hearings of now-Jus-
tice Ketanji Brown Jackson when I 
said that, often, Americans of color 
needed to work twice as hard to garner 
half the respect. Well, it comes as no 
surprise that Vanessa has gained the 
utmost respect from her former bosses 
and colleagues on the various Presi-
dential and Senate campaigns that she 
has been a part of and from the Senate 
offices that she has worked in, includ-
ing those of Senators BOOKER, HEIN-
RICH, and PETERS in addition to mine, 
and I have no doubt that she will bring 
the same work ethic and savvy to serv-
ing the First Lady and the Biden ad-
ministration. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to deliver the next part of my re-
marks in Spanish. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PADILLA. (English translation 
of statement made in Spanish is as fol-
lows:) 
Vanessa, I wish you all the luck in your 
next chapter. Don’t forget your friends here 
in the Senate. I have no doubt that you will 
continue to do great things working for the 
First Lady and the Biden administration. 
Thank you for your work for all of Cali-
fornia. 
Mr. President, let the record reflect 
that Vanessa Valdivia will be deeply 
missed and that the State of California 
and the U.S. Senate thank her for her 
service. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Texas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4632 
September 15, 2022 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
117th Congress is drawing to a close, 
and there is a lot we need to do before 
the end of the year when the 117th Con-
gress is no more. 
At the top of that list, of course, are 
must-pass bills. In the next couple of 
weeks, the Senate is expected to pass a 
short-term funding bill to avert a gov-
ernment shutdown. Later this year, we 
will either have to pass another short- 
term extension or a full government 
funding 
package, 
otherwise 
known 
around here as an omnibus. 
On top of that, Congress needs to 
pass the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, which it has done 61 years in 
a row. The majority leader has, so far, 
declined to put that bill on the floor. 
This is a piece of legislation that pro-
vides our men and women in uniform 
the training they need and the equip-
ment they need to fight and win Amer-
ica’s wars and, hopefully, to prevent a 
war. It also supports our military fami-
lies, and with an all-volunteer military 
like we have, it is critical that Con-
gress step up and not only provide for 
those who wear the uniform but for 
those who also serve as members of 
that military member’s family. 
Even though these major pieces of 
legislation garner most of the atten-
tion, there are countless other bills 
that need to reach the President’s desk 
before the end of this Congress. As the 
Presiding Officer knows, if a bill passes 
one Chamber but doesn’t pass both and 
isn’t signed into law, it literally ex-
pires. Many of these bills pass the Sen-
ate with overwhelming bipartisan sup-
port but continue to collect dust on the 
House calendar. 
One of those bills is the Jenna Quinn 
Law, which I have spoken about many 
times here on the Senate floor. 
This legislation carries the name of a 
brave young woman from Texas who 
was a survivor of child sexual assault. 
Jenna, as a result of her own terrible 
experience, has made it her mission to 
end the cycle of abuse that harms chil-
dren and communities across the coun-
try. Her work is having a big impact. 
She was the inspiration behind the 2009 
Texas law that requires training for 
teachers, caregivers, and other adults 
who work with children on how to pre-
vent, recognize, and report child sexual 
abuse. Since then, a number of other 
States have passed similar laws, but 
this training lacks a source of funding 
in many instances, and that is where 
the Jenna Quinn Law comes into play. 
I introduced this bill with Senator 
HASSAN of New Hampshire to finally 
back those training sessions with Fed-
eral funding through grants from the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services. We initially introduced the 
bill last Congress, and it passed the 
Senate unanimously. Unfortunately, it 
became a political hostage and was 
used to try to exert leverage to ad-
vance a partisan bill that stood no 
chance of passage. So here we are, 2 
years later, and the bill is, once again, 
stuck in House purgatory. It has now 
passed the Senate twice—both times 
with unanimous support—but for some 
inexplicable reason, the House refuses 
to even hold a vote. 
This is an issue that is way too im-
portant for politics. The children who 
suffer as a result of child abuse and ne-
glect continue to suffer. As for the 
caregivers who might be able, as a re-
sult of the training they receive, to 
identify a child who is suffering from 
the abuse, that training is not occur-
ring as a result of the intransigence of 
the House of Representatives. 
So I would implore of Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Leader 
HOYER, 
and 
other 
Democratic leaders in the House who 
control the majority to please pass this 
critical legislation. 
Here is another great example of a 
bill that passed the Senate but which is 
stuck in the House. 
Last year, the Senate passed a bipar-
tisan bill I introduced with Senator 
WHITEHOUSE of Rhode Island, called the 
Residential Substance Use Disorder 
Treatment Act, to help incarcerated 
individuals who are struggling with 
drug abuse. 
There is a well-established link be-
tween drug abuse and crime. In order 
for these individuals who have the req-
uisite desire to try to turn their lives 
around to have the best shot at living 
healthy and productive lives, they need 
to break the cycle of addiction. The 
Residential Substance Use Disorder 
Treatment Act provides incarcerated 
individuals with access to treatment 
for their substance use disorders. This 
treatment is coupled with programs to 
prepare these men and women to reen-
ter society, and it provides them with 
community-based treatment once they 
are released. 
We 
learned, 
from 
experience 
in 
Texas, that it is not enough just to 
give people who commit nonviolent 
crimes an opportunity to improve 
themselves while they are in prison. 
There also needs to be follow-on serv-
ices to support them, particularly if 
they are trying to recover from their 
addictions. 
Our bill updates the program and ex-
pands access to treatment in jails and 
prisons around the country so we can 
reduce recidivism and build safer and 
healthier communities. More than two 
dozen organizations have endorsed this 
bill, including law enforcement, crimi-
nal justice, and behavioral health 
groups. It passed the Senate with unan-
imous support last year, but for some 
unknown reason, it still is lingering on 
the House calendar. 
This is a commonsense, nonpolitical 
bill that will help get folks the critical 
assistance they need in order to break 
the cycle of addiction and to live 
healthier, productive lives. So why 
won’t the House pass a bill that will 
help fund law enforcement and bolster 
our fight against drug abuse? Well, we 
are not receiving any sort of answers. 
The third bill I would like to mention 
is one I introduced with Senator 
PADILLA, the Senator from California, 
to support infrastructure projects and 
disaster relief across the country. 
Last year, State and local govern-
ments received huge sums of money for 
COVID–19 relief, but as more people 
have gotten vaccinated and we have 
learned, somehow, to live with this 
virus, many of these governments at 
the State and local levels have found 
themselves with huge amounts of cash 
that they can’t use for the agreed-upon 
purpose and that they don’t need any-
more for that purpose. 
So the idea behind the bill is pretty 
simple: Give the State and local lead-
ers the flexibility they need to invest 
in the most critical projects in their 
communities. In some places, that may 
mean pandemic relief-related expenses 
still, 
eliminating 
hospital 
staffing 
shortages, and supporting more vac-
cinations. But in places where the need 
is simply not there, our bill gives these 
leaders the option to invest in things 
that are actually needed and that will 
have a lasting impact. That includes 
infrastructure 
projects 
like 
con-
structing bridges, extending railways, 
modernizing ports, and expanding ac-
cess to broadband. It also includes dis-
aster relief, which is a major need in 
many States across the country. 
Both Texas and Kentucky, for exam-
ple, 
have 
experienced 
devastating 
flooding in the last couple of months. 
Jackson, MS, is in the midst of a water 
crisis that has dragged on for weeks, 
with no end in sight. The Speaker’s 
home State of California continues to 
battle destructive wildfires. 
If this bill becomes law—again, it 
passed the Senate 100 to 0—State and 
local leaders will be able to put a por-
tion of the COVID–19 relief dollars to-
ward disaster relief. This is voluntary 
on their part. There is no requirement 
that they do so, but if they need it and 
they don’t need it for COVID–19 pur-
poses, then, we ought to give them the 
authority to use it. Again, these funds 
are already appropriated. So there is 
no worry about an inflationary appro-
priation of additional funds. Local 
leaders know their communities best, 
and they should be able to use this 
funding in a way that makes the most 
sense for them. 
Senator PADILLA and I worked with 
our Senate colleagues and the White 
House to craft language that everyone 
could live with. We built broad bipar-
tisan support for the bill, and it passed 
the Senate, as I said, 100 to 0. Once 
again, 8 months later, the House has 
done nothing. Speaker PELOSI, so far, 
has declined to let this bill pass even 
though it would support disaster relief 
in her own State and even though it 
passed by huge bipartisan majorities. 
Those are just three of the bills that 
are stuck in the House that have 
passed the Senate. 
The Senate has unanimously ad-
vanced legislation to support programs 
for those experiencing mental health 
crises, to provide tax relief to survivors 
of human trafficking, to equip law en-
forcement officials with the tools they

need to help people in mental health 
crises, to increase cross-border trade 
with Canada and Mexico, and to beef up 
security for cargo at ports of entry. 
There are bills to cut redtape, to in-
crease payments to the child support 
program, and to ensure noncustodial 
parents have the opportunity to spend 
more time with their children. 
Our colleagues have even refused to 
pass a bill naming the post office in Ar-
lington, TX, after their late colleague 
and 
my 
friend 
Congressman 
Ron 
Wright. There is no particular reason 
for it. They just haven’t done it, with 
no explanation. 
All of these bills I have named are 
just a handful of the ones I have intro-
duced that are waiting in House purga-
tory. Add in the long list of bills led by 
our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, and you have got a major legisla-
tive pileup in the House. 
Unlike the Senate, the House has not 
been in continuous session, and the 
House is only scheduled to be in for 6 
more weeks this year. Unless Speaker 
PELOSI allows movement on these com-
monsense bipartisan bills, we are going 
to have to start all over again come 
January. It is time to get these bills 
moving. 
I know our colleagues in the House 
don’t necessarily embrace all the legis-
lation that is passed by the Senate, but 
when commonsense legislation passes 
with unanimity or broad bipartisan 
support, there just doesn’t seem to be 
any excuse for not acting. 
These aren’t controversial bills. We 
are talking about preventing child sex-
ual abuse, breaking the cycle of drug 
abuse, strengthening disaster relief, 
supporting people in crisis, and so 
much more. 
As I said, these bills are just one step 
away from heading to the President’s 
desk for his signature. So I implore 
Speaker PELOSI to please take up these 
Senate-passed 
bills 
and 
allow 
the 
House to vote on them, pass them, and 
send them to the President for his sig-
nature. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask

NOMINATION OF DAVID P. PEKOSKE 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to ask my col-
leagues to vote on the nomination of 
Admiral David Pekoske to serve a sec-
ond term as Administrator of the 
Transportation Security Administra-
tion. 
We recently commemorated the anni-
versary of the 9/11 attacks and the 3,000 
lives lost here in the United States 
when tragically the Pentagon was 
struck, 
downtown 
Manhattan, 
and 
Shanksville, PA. In response to that, 
Congress created the TSA—Transpor-
tation 
Security 
Administration—to 
strengthen the Nation’s security and 
our transportation system. 
And every day that TSA works the 
frontlines to protect the traveling pub-
lic, it is working to also prevent future 
attacks. It is safeguarding our Nation’s 
infrastructure and certainly working 
every day to make sure that the flying 
public continues to move through a 
successful process. 
TSA’s mission lies in the commit-
ment 
of 
professionals 
and 
highly 
skilled individuals. Admiral Pekoske’s 
confirmation and continued leadership 
of this team will enable the TSA to fur-
ther its ongoing and important mis-
sion. 
Over the past two decades, the TSA 
has had to deal with many challenges: 
facing the continued threats of con-
cealing weapons in shoes and under-
wear and even in soft drinks. And in 
2010, the TSA began detecting explo-
sives in electronics and countering at-
tacks on the public side of airports. 
Today, the landscape is even more so-
phisticated with state and nonstate ac-
tors and cyber attacks. Unique chal-
lenges posed to us during the COVID 
pandemic have made these challenges 
to the aviation security landscape even 
greater. 
We know that we need to have con-
tinued experienced leadership. And Ad-
mirable Pekoske is well qualified for 
this position. He will continue to make 
transportation security and its mod-
ernization the Nation’s No. 1 priority 
as it relates to the sector. 
Each day, at over 430 airports across 
the country, TSA screens over 2 mil-
lion passengers and 1.4 million checked 
bags for explosives and other dangerous 
items. This helps ensure the security 
for over 24,000 domestic flights and 
nearly 3,300 outbound international 
flights per day. 
Security demands for the Agency are 
returning and every day are continuing 
to grow. Over the Labor Day weekend, 
TSA screened nearly 11 million people, 
or 3 percent more, over the cor-
responding period in 2019. In fact, TSA 
screened more people on 4 of the 5 days, 
from September 1 to 5, marking the 
first sustained period of checkpoint 
throughput during a holiday weekend 
above prepandemic levels. 
So the traveling public is back, and, 
obviously, we need dedicated TSA offi-
cers and individuals to continue to 
work. We are not saying that there 
aren’t improvements to that process— 
there certainly are—but TSA has been 
charged with a critical, obviously, re-
sponsibility to make sure that we con-
tinue to work to ensure the safety of 
our air transportation system. 
Last year’s ransomware attack on 
Colonial Pipeline threatened nearly 50 
percent of the east coast’s fuel supply. 
So we must harden all of our targets 
and make sure the TSA has leadership 
to make sure that they, too, are help-
ing us address these emerging threats. 
Admiral 
Pekoske’s 
experience 
in 
leading TSA in these critical missions 
deserves support for renomination to 
this position again. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the harmful economic 
consequences Americans are seeing 
from President Biden’s reckless tax- 
and-spend agenda. Earlier this week, 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics released 
the latest Consumer Price Index fig-
ures for the month of August, showing 
that inflation increased 8.3 percent 
compared to August 2021. Inflation has 
now exceeded 8 percent for 6 straight 
months. This persistent high inflation 
is causing price increases for American 
families at the grocery store, the gas 
pump, and for basic housing needs, 
leaving many Americans struggling to 
make ends meet. 
Rather than getting government out 
of the way, increasing domestic energy 
production, securing our border, and 
taking meaningful action to reduce in-
flation, the Biden administration is in-
stead doubling down on its failed eco-
nomic policies. Gas prices are $1.34 per 
gallon higher than when President 
Biden took office, and diesel fuel prices 
are even higher, at nearly $2.40 per gal-
lon more than January 2021. A gallon of 
diesel now costs more than $5 a gallon. 
Yet, last month, as followup to the 
massive $2 trillion spending package 
from March 2021 that fueled the infla-
tionary fire we are now dealing with, 
Democrats jammed through another 
package on a party-line vote, a tax- 
and-spend bill that imposes new energy 
taxes and Green New Deal-style sub-
sidies that will only worsen our energy 
crisis and weaken our Nation’s eco-
nomic and national security. 
Ironically, the so-called Inflation Re-
duction Act does nothing to reduce in-
flation. Analysis by economists at 
Penn Wharton School at the University 
of Pennsylvania, the Federal Reserve, 
Moody’s Analytics, the Congressional 
Budget Office, and others, all agree 
that this bill will do nothing to help re-
duce inflation. 
Meanwhile, the cost of food at the 
grocery store has increased 13.5 percent 
over the last 12 months—the largest 12- 
month increase since March 1979. Yet 
the Biden administration has done 
nothing to help alleviate these infla-
tionary price increases on Americans. 
This week, we neared the brink of an-
other inflationary supply chain dis-
aster as railroad unions threatened to 
go on strike. Obviously, shutting down 
freight rail movement throughout the 
country would be a huge disruption to

our economy. It cannot be overstated 
how significant a rail strike would be 
to our national supply chain. With fall 
harvest, particularly for my State, 
that is a huge concern, and it is vitally 
important that we avoid a rail strike. 
On the energy front, North Dakota is 
a huge provider of energy for this Na-
tion. So it is very important. Whether 
it is our energy producers or energy 
producers across this country, we need 
to empower our domestic energy pro-
duction. We also need to get our debt 
and deficit under control. We need to 
help our farmers and ranchers produce 
the highest quality, lowest cost food 
supply in the world. We need to address 
the supply chain issues that continue 
to be disruptive to our economy and 
create more inflation. 
The Biden administration needs to 
stop with the tax-and-spend agenda if 
we are to get this inflation under con-
trol.

clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
thank my colleagues from Oklahoma 
and Nebraska for letting us go forward. 
In a few moments, I will file cloture 
on a measure that will get the Senate 
to approve the Kigali Amendment to 
the Montreal Protocol. 
This important amendment, which 
already has been agreed to by 120 coun-
tries, will affirm our Nation’s commit-
ment to curb the use of dangerous 
hydrofluorocarbons, 
HFCs. 
These 
hypertoxic 
chemicals 
are 
regularly 
found, unfortunately, in everyday ap-
pliances from air conditioners to re-
frigerators. 
In December of 2020, we passed the 
AIM Act, which took a drastic step to 
limit HFCs and was one of the most 
significant climate accomplishments 
ever, of course, until we passed the In-
flation Reduction Act a month ago. 
HFCs need to be dealt with as soon as 
possible because they are thousands— 
thousands—of times more damaging to 
our atmosphere than carbon dioxide. 
So this is a very important oppor-
tunity for the Senate to make official 
America’s intention to phase these 
dangerous chemicals out of use. 
Approving this amendment will re-
quire two-thirds of the Senate. Reduc-
ing our country’s use of HFCs has been 
a bipartisan priority in the past, so 
both parties should work together to 
accelerate passage of this measure. 
Also, I will file on the nomination of 
Judge Florence Pan to serve as a cir-
cuit court judge for the D.C. Circuit, 
one of the most important judicial ap-
pointments we can make. After the Su-
preme Court, the D.C. Circuit Court of 
Appeals is the most important Federal 
court in the country with jurisdiction 
over cases involving Congress and the 
entire executive branch. The judges 
who preside on the D.C. Circuit must 
be individuals of high character, unas-
sailable qualifications. 
A few months ago, we elevated some-
one who meets these standards when 
confirming Michelle Childs to the 
bench, and we intend to do it again 
with Judge Pan’s nomination. 
Looking 
ahead, 
confirming 
even 
more of the President’s judicial nomi-
nees will be a priority for the Senate.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to legisla-
tive session and be in a period of morn-
ing business with senators permitted to 
speak therein for up to 10 minutes 
each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SHIREEN ABU AKLEH 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on 
May 19, I echoed Secretary of State 
Blinken’s call for an ‘‘independent, 
credible investigation’’ of the violent 
death of widely respected Palestinian- 
American 
journalist 
Shireen 
Abu 
Akleh. At that time, several Members 
of Congress called for the FBI to be in-
volved, as did I. That would be cus-
tomary and appropriate after a tragedy 
like this involving a prominent Amer-
ican killed overseas under questionable 
circumstances. 
Secretary Blinken later said, and I 
agree, that ‘‘[w]hen that investigation 
happens, we will follow the facts, wher-
ever they lead. It’s as straightforward 
as that.’’ 
Unfortunately, there has been no 
independent, 
credible 
investigation. 
Two weeks ago, without providing any 
details, the Israeli Government, after 
first blaming the Palestinians for Ms. 
Abu Akleh’s death, stated that she was 
likely 
shot, 
by 
mistake, 
by 
an 
unnamed Israeli soldier. The State De-
partment has concluded that gunfire 
from Israeli Defense Force—IDF—posi-
tions was likely responsible, but that 
there was ‘‘no evidence to indicate her 
killing was intentional.’’ The Depart-
ment acknowledges that conclusion 
was not the result of an investigation, 
but rather a review of information pro-
vided by the IDF and the Palestinian 
Authority—PA. We are told that ‘‘the 
Administration continues to believe 
that cooperation among Israel, the Pal-
estinian Authority, and the U.S. Secu-
rity Coordinator (USSC) is the best 
path to support a thorough, trans-
parent, and impartial investigation.’’ 
No one can credibly think that the 
PA, which does not have access to the 
IDF soldier who likely fired the bullet 
that killed Ms. Abu Akleh or to other 
IDF personnel who may have informa-
tion about it, or Israel which has a his-
tory of investigations of shootings by 
IDF soldiers that rarely result in ac-
countability, can be completely relied 
on to determine and make public all 
the facts of what happened in this case. 
The USSC, echoing the conclusion of 
the IDF, apparently did not interview 
any of the IDF soldiers or any other 
witnesses. To say that fatally shooting 
an unarmed person, and in this case 
one with ‘‘PRESS’’ written in bold let-
ters on her clothing, was not inten-
tional, without providing any evidence 
to support that conclusion, calls into 
question the State Department’s com-
mitment to an independent, credible 
investigation and to ‘‘follow the facts.’’ 
More than 3 months later, key ques-
tions remain unanswered. 
Other than reviewing the investiga-
tions conducted by the IDF and the PA, 
did the USSC review any of the evi-
dence collected from other investiga-
tions, including those conducted by the 
New York Times, the Washington Post, 
CNN, the Associated Press, or the Of-
fice of the United Nations High Com-
missioner for Human Rights? If so, 
which of those other investigations did

the USSC review and what conclusions, 
if any, did the USSC reach with respect 
to those investigations? 
What specific evidence led to the 
USSC’s conclusion ‘‘that there is no 
reason to believe that this was inten-
tional but rather the result of tragic 
circumstances’’? 
What 
were 
the 
‘‘tragic 
cir-
cumstances’’ the USSC was referring 
to? 
If the soldier who fired the fatal shot 
did not intend to kill Ms. Abu Akleh, 
what did he intend? 
If, as the Israeli authorities appear to 
be saying, the soldier missed who he 
was aiming at and hit Ms. Abu Akleh 
by mistake, who was he aiming at? 
What evidence is there, if any, that 
anyone in the immediate vicinity of 
where Ms. Abu Akleh was shot was fir-
ing at the IDF soldier who killed her? 
What steps will the State Depart-
ment take to ensure the independent, 
credible investigation the Secretary, 
and many others, have called for? 
What steps has the State Department 
taken to determine whether the Leahy 
Law applies in this case? 
On July 5, the Department spokes-
person said ‘‘we would want to see ac-
countability in any case of a wrongful 
death. That would especially—and is 
especially the case in the wrongful 
death of an American citizen, as was 
Shireen Abu Akleh.’’ What steps does 
the Department plan to take to ensure 
such accountability? 
I have also urged Israeli authorities 
to discipline those who were respon-
sible for, and participated in, the chaos 
that erupted during Ms. Abu Akleh’s 
funeral procession, when Israeli police 
needlessly beat mourners with batons, 
including 
the 
pallbearers, 
causing 
them to momentarily drop one end of 
the casket. Has anything been done? 
There is an increasing foreboding 
that, as in so many other cases and 
like the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, 
there will never be the independent, 
credible investigation and account-
ability that Ms. Abu Akleh’s family, 
the Secretary of State, I, and others 
have called for. That would further 
jeopardize the safety of journalists ev-
erywhere who courageously risk their 
lives to inform the public. An inde-
pendent, credible investigation—mean-
ing not by the IDF and not by the PA— 
but with their full cooperation, must 
be conducted and the findings made 
public. Whether her killing was inten-
tional, reckless, or a tragic mistake, 
there must be accountability. And if it 
was intentional, and if no one is held 
accountable, then the Leahy Law must 
be applied.

REMEMBERING JODIE FINGLAND 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize and honor the 
life of Jodie Fingland, a dedicated pub-
lic servant who passed away on Sep-
tember 4 after battling a long illness. 
Jodie devoted her life’s work to ex-
panding educational opportunities for 
students across the country, and she 
will be remembered for her wonderful, 
caring personality. I join my staff and 
so many others who had the privilege 
of knowing and working with Jodie 
through her tireless work at the De-
partment of Education in mourning her 
passing and remembering her life. 
Over the years, Jodie held many dif-
ferent positions at the Department of 
Education in the Obama administra-
tion. She served as chief of staff, dep-
uty assistant secretary, and principal 
adviser for legislative affairs all in the 
Office for Legislation and Congres-
sional Affairs, and worked closely with 
the Senate and House in these roles. 
Whether briefing Members of Con-
gress, preparing the Secretary for a 
committee hearing, or providing stra-
tegic advice to senior managers at the 
Department, Jodie was known for 
being 
kind, 
calm, 
and 
extremely 
knowledgeable. She was particularly 
known for her skill in higher education 
policy. 
Jodie dedicated her career to the ad-
vancement and improvement of edu-
cation for all, and her work impacted 
so many students, educators, and fami-
lies across the country. She will be re-
membered fondly.

REMEMBERING 
MARGARET 
‘‘MEGAN’’ MICHAEL DEBRANSKI 
KELHART 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor the life of Margaret 
‘‘Megan’’ Michael Debranski Kelhart. 
Megan passed away on August 19, 2022, 
after a heroic battle with cancer. 
Megan spent her career as a dedi-
cated public servant. Megan most re-
cently worked as head of congressional 
and legislative affairs for the Bureau of 
Reclamation. Prior to that, she worked 
for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the U.S. Senate. In these roles, she 
worked with nearly every congres-
sional office. 
Megan was born on December 2, 1975, 
in Norfolk, VA. In 1994, Megan grad-
uated from Lakeland High School 
where she excelled as a student and 
was a standout tennis player on a State 
champion tennis team. She was also a 
cheerleader, school band member, and 
prom queen. Megan later studied polit-
ical science at Virginia Tech, where 
she was an active member of the Alpha 
Chi Omega sorority and later received 
her master of science degree in natural 
resources. 
In 2001, Megan met her husband Mat-
thew, while playing in the Senate sum-
mer softball league. The couple mar-
ried in October of 2003. Together, they 
enjoyed college football and travelling 
the world together. In 2009, Megan and 
her 
husband 
welcomed 
their 
son, 
Matteson Michael Donnan Kelhart. 
Megan is survived by her husband 
Matthew and their son Matteson of Al-
exandria, 
VA; 
father 
Dr. 
Michael 
Debranski 
and 
mother 
Margaret 
Debranski of Suffolk, VA; grandmother

many other loved ones. 
I ask our colleagues to join us in hon-
oring the life of Margaret ‘‘Megan’’ Mi-
chael Debranski Kelhart.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING HEARTLAND CHIA 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, each week I recognize an 
outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize Heartland Chia 
of Franklin, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Chris Kummer’s small business was 
founded on an idea that virtually no 
one thought possible: successful chia 
crops planted and harvested in the 
United States. But as a fifth-genera-
tion farmer, Mr. Kummer is no strang-
er to the challenges posed by mother 
nature. Thus, with decades of farming 
experience under his belt and a tireless 
dedication to his crops, Mr. Kummer 
has turned this once crazy idea into a 
thriving business. Founded in 2012, 
Heartland Chia develops and markets 
locally grown chia to buyers across the 
country. Chris’s wife, Jill Kummer, 
joins her husband at the helm of their 
business, handling most of the mar-
keting and administrative duties while 
her husband works with the crop di-
rectly in the field. Together, the 
Kummers are proud to be the only chia 
seed growers in the U.S.A., a tremen-
dous feat that adds to the biodiversity 
of Kentucky’s burgeoning agricultural 
industry. 
Mr. Kummer will be the first to tell 
you that his business would not be pos-
sible had it not been for the visionary 
researchers at the University of Ken-
tucky College of Food, Agriculture, 
and Environment. Since his great- 
grandfather planted his first crop on 
their family farm in 1889, the Kummers 
have grown crops traditional to the 
Midwestern U.S., such as soy, wheat, 
and corn. It never occurred to them to 
plant chia as the plant requires a very

September 15, 2022 
long summer in order to grow and 
produce seed, meaning that most of the 
world’s chia plants are grown in re-
gions near the equator, such as Central 
America. Farmers everywhere took it 
for granted that this plant could not be 
grown north of the U.S.-Mexico border, 
but the breeding program over at the 
University Kentucky sought to change 
that. Over a period spanning 6 to 8 
years, 
researchers 
Dr. 
David 
Hildebrand and Dr. Tim Phillips, both 
plant and soil scientists, used decades 
old breeding methods to create a new 
strain of chia that would flower earlier 
in the year, allowing the crop to sur-
vive in less temperate climates than 
those near the equator. Once the sci-
entists created a product they were 
confident in, they were careful in se-
lecting a steward for their new ‘‘Early 
Flowering’’ chia seed. Dr. Hildebrand 
knew Chris Kummer from his days as a 
student at UK and knew of his farming 
background; therefore he immediately 
came to mind. 
In 
2011, 
Dr. 
Phillips 
and 
Dr. 
Hildebrand gave Mr. Kummer half the 
world’s seed supply of this new strain 
of chia. In the first year of planting, 
the Kummers lost most of their chia 
crops, as they and the researchers over 
at University of Kentucky were still 
learning best practices for growing this 
new crop. But through the persistence 
instilled in him from his farmer fore-
bears, Chris and his wife absorbed as 
much knowledge as they could from 
this first planting season and put it to 
the test the next year. By the end of 
their 
second 
planting 
season, 
the 
Kummers had already entered into 
commercial production. The success of 
this second season led UK to purchase 
a patent for the seed, ensuring that it 
only be used for benefit of American 
farmers, domestic food manufacturers, 
and domestic consumers. 
Today, Heartland Chia works with 
several farmers across four different 
States that all use the Kummer’s chia 
for manufacturing processes. By pro-
ducing 
this 
previously 
ungrowable 
plant in the U.S., the Kummers have 
not only added to the biodiversity of 
the State, they have created a reliable 
source of what is now widely consid-
ered ‘‘a superfood.’’ In a recent publica-
tion, the Mayo Clinic listed chia as one 
of the few foods truly deserving the dis-
tinction of ‘‘superfood’’ due its long 
list of health and nutritional benefits. 
Given this growth in consumer de-
mand, it was only natural that Mr. 
Kummer would embark on this experi-
mental journey with the support of his 
family, University of Kentucky sci-
entists, as well as food manufacturers 
seeking top-quality chia. 
Chris has been celebrated for his in-
novative spirit as several food compa-
nies encouraged him to pursue this un-
likely feat of growing chia on Amer-
ican soil. Chris has fulfilled a need 
within the U.S. market as many food 
suppliers lacked a reliable source for 
top quality chia seeds. After over-
coming the odds, the Kummers con-
tinue to grow and produce their own 
chia and market their products direct 
to consumers and to food suppliers 
alike. Not only are they doing a great 
service to the economy and ecology of 
Kentucky, they are spreading the good 
word about an unlikely food that 
greatly bolsters our body’s health. 
Through persistence and dedication, 
the Kummers have made their dream a 
reality, to the great benefit of Ken-
tucky and beyond. Congratulations to 
Chris and Jill Kummer, along with the 
entire team at Heartland Chia. I thank 
you for your innovative outlook and 
entrepreneurial spirit, and I look for-
ward to seeing your continued growth 
and success in Kentucky.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
CORTEZ MASTO, and Ms. WAR-
REN): 
S. 4857. A bill to amend the Securi-
ties Exchange Act of 1934 to require 
companies to file public reports after 
meeting certain quantitative thresh-
olds, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I 
am joined by Senator CORTEZ MASTO in 
introducing 
the 
Private 
Markets 
Transparency and Accountability Act, 
a bill that will address a disturbing 
trend in our capital markets. Increas-
ingly, some of America’s largest and 
most important companies are exploit-
ing weaknesses in our securities laws 
to stay or go dark; that is, they are 
avoiding requirements to enter the 
public markets, where disclosure and 
transparency are required under law. 
Instead, they are remaining indefi-
nitely in the private markets, where 
there is less visibility into the health 
and activities of the company. 
Why should average Americans care? 
First, they are invested in these com-
panies through pension plans and mu-
tual funds. Second, transparency is the 
lifeblood of fair and efficient markets. 
And third, these companies have in-
credible influence over our society and 
way of life. 
This legislation will address this dis-
turbing trend by requiring the Nation’s 
largest and most important private 
companies to register with the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission, SEC. 
Requiring registration would put these 
companies on par with publicly traded 
corporations with regard to ongoing 
public disclosure about their business 
practices and financial condition. 
The most significant development in 
the capital markets over the last dec-
ade has been the explosive growth of 
the private markets. According to con-
sulting firm McKinsey, annual private 
market fundraising reached a record of 
almost $1.2 trillion worldwide in 2021 
up from $380 billion in 2011. More 
money has been raised in the private 
markets than in the public markets 
each year over the past 10 years. Many 
large companies find the allure of vir-
tually no public transparency or over-
sight that is available in the private 
markets irresistible. Under current 
law, they find that it is all too easy to 
stay private forever. 
Under the Securities Exchange Act of 
1934, Exchange Act, a private company

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4641 
September 15, 2022 
must register with the SEC after 
reaching 2,000 shareholders ‘‘of record.’’ 
But this requirement is easily cir-
cumvented 
because 
a 
single 
Wall 
Street broker or bank, which holds se-
curities on behalf of thousands of un-
derlying investors, is counted as one 
recordholder. The SEC estimates that 
under this threshold, 89 percent of pub-
lic companies could choose to transi-
tion to the private markets and go 
dark tomorrow. 
This threshold desperately needs re-
form. Former SEC Chairman Mary 
Schapiro has testified before the Bank-
ing Committee that ‘‘since the defini-
tion of ‘held of record’ was put into 
place, a fundamental shift has occurred 
in how securities are held in the United 
States.’’ And Harvard Law Professor 
John Coates recently testified before 
the committee that ‘‘there is much to 
be said for revisiting the thresholds 
that are built into the [Exchange] Act, 
thinking about them in a different 
way, [and] not simply counting num-
bers.’’ 
It should be alarming when private 
companies can become extremely large 
and influential in our economy and 
raise unlimited amounts of capital 
from an unlimited number of investors, 
while circumventing the basic disclo-
sure and governance requirements that 
Congress sought to apply. That is what 
is happening today. A central feature 
of the Exchange Act has effectively 
been gutted. 
Again, these are not small or incon-
sequential 
companies. 
Former 
SEC 
Commissioner Allison Herren Lee has 
observed that very large private com-
panies are ‘‘notable not just for their 
size, but for their transformational im-
pacts on our way of life. They have, for 
example, changed the transportation 
and travel habits of millions across the 
globe, spawned billions of dollars in 
litigation, 
changed 
the 
legal 
underpinnings of entire markets, and 
launched civilians into space. Yet, de-
spite their outsize impact, there is lit-
tle public information available about 
their activities. They are not required 
to file periodic reports or make the dis-
closures required in proxy statements. 
They are not even required to obtain, 
much less distribute, audited financial 
statements. This has consequences for 
investors 
and 
policymakers 
alike, 
which in turn may have consequences 
for the broader economy.’’ 
The Private Markets Transparency 
and Accountability Act would restore 
the Exchange Act in order to provide 
the public with the essential insight it 
needs to make informed decisions. 
Under our legislation, private compa-
nies would be required to register with 
the SEC if they either reach a valu-
ation of $700 million, excluding shares 
held by affiliates, or have at least 5,000 
employees and $5 billion in revenues. 
These companies would enter the pub-
lic disclosure system that Congress es-
tablished in the Exchange Act and 
would have powerful incentives to con-
duct public stock offerings and list 
their shares on stock exchanges. 
Our legislation would provide mom- 
and-pop investors in the private mar-
kets with nearly all of the same protec-
tions that they are entitled to in the 
public markets. Pension plans that in-
vest in companies through private eq-
uity funds would finally be able to ob-
tain basic information about those 
companies, such as their audited finan-
cial statements, and employees who 
get compensated with company stock 
and options would be able to determine 
the true value of their shares. They 
would no longer need to fly blind when 
deciding whether to take another job 
and face the potentially enormous fi-
nancial consequences of relinquishing 
their stock or options. 
By mandating that very highly val-
ued or large companies register with 
the SEC, our legislation would raise 
the bar on governance for companies 
that control huge swaths of our econ-
omy. The ability to stay private for-
ever has directly led to the dramatic 
rise of ‘‘unicorns,’’ or private compa-
nies with at least a $1 billion valu-
ation. At the start of December 2021, 
the United States had nearly 473 uni-
corns. Some of these unicorns have 
been plagued by scandals and toxic cul-
tures, without needing to comply with 
governance requirements for public 
companies designed to curb waste and 
force management accountability. Still 
others have been exposed as outright 
frauds. In these situations, investors 
suffer losses while fund managers keep 
their fees and company executives keep 
their bonuses. Arguably, greater trans-
parency would have protected investors 
from unnecessary losses. Indeed, some 
unicorns that received sky-high valu-
ations in the opaque private markets 
saw those valuations tumble when they 
faced the discipline and scrutiny that 
comes 
with 
public 
market 
trans-
parency. 
Finally, our legislation helps mar-
kets allocate capital more efficiently. 
When risks are obscured in dark cor-
ners of our markets, then capital may 
not be directed towards the most de-
serving companies. When similar com-
panies in similar industries of similar 
size are subject to wildly different dis-
closure requirements, market partici-
pants have less information to value 
those 
companies. 
That 
means 
the 
shares of many public companies may 
not be accurately priced. Without accu-
rate prices, retail investors cannot 
have confidence that they are getting 
reasonable 
returns 
on 
their 
hard- 
earned savings. 
Our capital markets depend on dis-
closure and transparency. As more 
companies remain private indefinitely 
or go dark, we lose those features and 
weaken the foundational strengths of 
our economy. We need to restore these 
bedrock requirements and ensure that 
they apply to all major companies 
whether they are in the private or the 
public markets. 
I thank the bill’s supporters, includ-
ing the AFL–CIO, the Consumer Fed-
eration of America, the North Amer-
ican Securities Administrators Asso-
ciation, the Healthy Markets Associa-
tion, Public Citizen, former SEC Com-
missioner Robert J. Jackson, Columbia 
Law Professor John Coffee, and Har-
vard Law Professor John Coates. 
I would like to thank Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO for working with me on this leg-
islation, and I urge our colleagues to 
join us in supporting the Private Mar-
kets Transparency and Accountability 
Act. 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. WARNER): 
S. 4864. A bill to amend the Natural 
Gas Act to bolster fairness and trans-
parency in the consideration of inter-
state natural gas pipeline permits, to 
provide for greater public input oppor-
tunities in the natural gas pipeline per-
mitting process, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today I 
am introducing a bill to make the proc-
ess of siting natural gas pipelines fair-
er, more transparent, and more respon-
sive to landowner concerns. 
For some time now, I have been lis-
tening to Virginians with passionate 
views on the process involved in per-
mitting the Mountain Valley Pipeline, 
as well as the previous proposal for the 
Atlantic Coast Pipeline. For various 
reasons, many oppose one or both of 
these projects, while others support 
these projects. The Federal Energy 
Regulatory 
Commission, 
FERC, 
is 
tasked with analyzing all the issues— 
purpose and need for a project, impacts 
on people living on the route, potential 
risks to the environment or property— 
and deciding what course best serves 
the public interest. 
From listening to all sides, I have 
concluded that while reasonable people 
may 
reach 
different 
conclusions, 
FERC’s public input process is flawed 
and could be better. Accordingly, this 
legislation proposes several steps to ad-
dress 
several 
shortcomings, 
all 
of 
which were originally brought to my 
attention by Virginia constituents. For 
instance, 
this 
bill 
requires 
pro-
grammatic analysis of pipelines pro-
posed around the same time and in the 
same geographic vicinity so that the 
full impacts of multiple projects can be 
analyzed. It requires a greater number 
of public comment meetings so that 
citizens are not required to commute 
long distances to meetings at which 
they must speed through just a few 
minutes of remarks on these complex 
topics. It ensures that affected land-
owners are given proper notice and 
compensation. It guarantees that land-
owner complaints will be heard before 
construction commences, and it clari-
fies the circumstances under which 
eminent domain should and should not 
be used. 
I am pleased to be joined by my col-
league Senator MARK WARNER on this 
bill, which is an update to a version we 
introduced in the 116th Congress. The 
public deserves reasonable opportunity

to weigh in on energy infrastructure 
projects, and we are heeding calls by 
our constituents to make this process 
fairer and more transparent without 
mandating a particular outcome. 
I encourage the Senate to consider 
this legislation, not to pave the way 
for pipelines nor to throw up insur-
mountable roadblocks to them but to 
give the public greater certainty that 
the Federal Government’s infrastruc-
ture decisions are fair and transparent. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN): 
S. 4870. A bill to approve the settle-
ment of the water right claims of the 
Tule River Tribe, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Indian Af-
fairs. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the Tule River Tribe Re-
served Water Rights Settlement Act of 
2022. This legislation would finalize 
this multidecade effort by the Tule 
River Tribe to provide clean drinking 
water to their people and uphold the 
Federal Government’s trust and treaty 
responsibilities. 
The Tule River people are descend-
ants of the Yokuts Indians, a large 
group of Native Americans who occu-
pied what is now known as the San 
Joaquin Valley in California for thou-
sands of years prior to contact with 
settlers. 
In 1856, the Federal Government es-
tablished their reservation in Tulare 
County, with the specific goal of pro-
viding the Tribe with arable farmland 
and the water resources necessary to 
establish 
self-sufficiency. 
However, 
their land was fraudulently stolen from 
them, and in 1873, President Grant 
issued an Executive order to create a 
new reservation for the tribe. This 
land, which is the Tribe’s current res-
ervation, is comprised of mostly moun-
tainous lands that do not provide suffi-
cient irrigation opportunities or water 
storage facilities. Today, the Tule 
River Tribe struggles to provide clean 
drinking water to their people, and 
Tule Tribal citizens suffer from a low 
standard of living as a result. 
Since 1971, the Tribe has worked to 
establish its federally reserved water 
rights to create the viable homeland 
they were promised and to ensure that 
their citizens have enough water to 
meet their current and future water 
needs. For decades, the Tribe has 
worked with the Departments of the 
Interior and Justice as well as down-
stream water users to advance a settle-
ment 
agreement, 
thereby 
avoiding 
costly litigation for both the Tribe and 
the U.S. Government. 
I am proud to introduce this legisla-
tion to quantify the Tribe’s water right 
of 5,828 acre-feet per year of surface 
water and fund $568 million towards 
the construction of a water storage 
project. Our legislation would also cod-
ify what is known as the 2007 Agree-
ment with downstream water users, 
who support this legislation. Finally, 
the legislation would transfer approxi-
mately 9,000 acres of Federal land cur-
rently in the Sequoia National Monu-
ment to allow the Tribe to protect the 
watershed headwaters and 800 acres of 
grazing land to the north and south of 
the reservation boundary. 
It is long past time for the Federal 
Government to live up to its trust and 
treaty responsibilities to the Tule 
River Tribe. We must codify this water 
settlement and settle the Tule River 
Tribe’s 
claims 
against 
the 
United 
States. Access to clean drinking water 
now and in the future is essential to 
the continued strength of Tribal na-
tions and to ensuring the sustain-
ability and viability of future genera-
tions. 
Water is a sacred and necessary re-
source for Tribal nations and for all 
people. As California and the West con-
tinue 
to 
experience 
a 
historic 
megadrought, enactment of our legisla-
tion would provide water security to 
Tule River citizens now and into the 
future. 
I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for intro-
ducing this legislation with me in the 
Senate. I would also like to thank the 
Tule River Tribe for their decades of 
hard work to finalize this settlement 
and the downstream water users, in-
cluding the Tule River Association and 
the South Tule Independent Ditch 
Company, for working with the Tribe 
to settle this issue and avoid litigation. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to enact the Tule River 
Tribe Reserved Water Rights Settle-
ment Act of 2022 as quickly as possible.

SENATE RESOLUTION 765—DESIG-
NATING OCTOBER 8, 2022, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL HYDROGEN AND FUEL 
CELL DAY’’ 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL (for himself, Mr. 
GRAHAM, Mr. MURPHY, Mr. COONS, and 
Mr. PORTMAN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 765 
Whereas hydrogen, which has an atomic 
mass of 1.008, is the most abundant element 
in the universe; 
Whereas the United States is a world lead-
er in the development and deployment of 
fuel cell and hydrogen technologies; 
Whereas hydrogen fuel cells played an in-
strumental role in the United States space 
program, helping the United States achieve 
the mission of landing a man on the Moon; 
Whereas private industry, Federal and 
State governments, national laboratories, 
and institutions of higher education con-
tinue to improve fuel cell and hydrogen tech-
nologies to address the most pressing energy, 
environmental, and economic issues of the 
United States; 
Whereas fuel cells utilizing hydrogen and 
hydrogen-rich fuels to generate electricity 
are clean, efficient, safe, and resilient tech-
nologies being used for— 
(1) stationary and backup power genera-
tion; and 
(2) zero-emission transportation for light- 
duty vehicles, industrial vehicles, delivery 
vans, buses, trucks, trains, military vehicles, 
marine applications, and aerial vehicles; 
Whereas stationary fuel cells are being 
placed in service for continuous and backup 
power to provide businesses and other energy 
consumers with reliable power in the event 
of grid outages; 
Whereas stationary fuel cells can help re-
duce water use, as compared to traditional 
power generation technologies; 
Whereas fuel cell electric vehicles that uti-
lize hydrogen can completely replicate the 
experience of internal combustion vehicles, 
including comparable range and refueling 
times; 
Whereas hydrogen fuel cell industrial vehi-
cles are deployed at logistical hubs and ware-
houses across the United States and exported 
to facilities in Europe and Asia; 
Whereas hydrogen is a nontoxic gas that 
can be derived from a variety of domesti-
cally available traditional and renewable re-
sources, including solar, wind, biogas, and 
the abundant supply of natural gas in the 
United States; 
Whereas hydrogen and fuel cells can store 
energy to help enhance the grid and maxi-
mize opportunities to deploy renewable en-
ergy; 
Whereas the United States produces and 
uses approximately 10,000,000 metric tons of 
hydrogen per year; 
Whereas engineers and safety code and 
standard professionals have developed con-
sensus-based protocols for safe delivery, han-
dling, and use of hydrogen; and 
Whereas the ingenuity of the people of the 
United States is essential to paving the way 
for the future use of hydrogen technologies: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate designates Octo-
ber 8, 2022, as ‘‘National Hydrogen and Fuel 
Cell Day’’.

(4) an estimated 283,000 children seek care 
in United States emergency departments 
each year for a sports- or recreation-related 
traumatic brain injury, with traumatic brain 
injuries sustained in contact sports account-
ing for approximately 45 percent of these vis-
its; 
(5) research suggests that many children 
with a traumatic brain injury do not seek 
care in emergency departments or do not 
seek care at all, resulting in a significant un-

VAN HOLLEN, and Ms. WARREN) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 767 
Whereas direct care workers, including di-
rect support professionals, personal assist-
ants, personal attendants, in-home support 
workers, and paraprofessionals, are key to 
providing publicly funded, long-term support 
and services for millions of individuals with 
disabilities; 
Whereas direct support professionals pro-
vide essential services that ensure all indi-
viduals with disabilities are— 
(1) included as a valued part of the commu-
nities in which those individuals live; 
(2) supported at home, at work, and in the 
communities of the United States; and 
(3) empowered to live with the dignity that 
all people of the United States deserve; 
Whereas, by fostering connections between 
individuals with disabilities and their fami-
lies, friends, and communities, direct sup-
port professionals ensure that individuals 
with disabilities thrive, thereby avoiding 
more costly institutional care; 
Whereas direct support professionals build 
close, respectful, and trusting relationships 
with individuals with disabilities and pro-
vide a broad range of personalized support to 
those individuals, including— 
(1) helping individuals make person-cen-
tered choices; 
(2) assisting with personal care, meal prep-
aration, medication management, and other 
aspects of daily living; 
(3) assisting individuals in accessing the 
community and securing competitive, inte-
grated employment; 
(4) providing transportation to school, 
work, religious, and recreational activities; 
(5) helping with general daily affairs, such 
as assisting with financial matters, medical 
appointments, and personal interests; 
(6) assisting individuals in the transition 
from isolated or congregate settings or serv-
ices to living in the communities of their 
choice; and 
(7) helping to keep individuals with disabil-
ities safe and healthy during the COVID–19 
pandemic; 
Whereas there is a critical and increasing 
shortage of direct support professionals 
throughout the United States, a crisis which 
has been exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, bringing uncertainty and risk to indi-
viduals with disabilities; 
Whereas direct support professionals do 
not have their own Standard Occupational 
Classification for the purposes of federal 
data collection, which includes data pro-
duced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of 
the Department of Labor; 
Whereas the direct care workforce, includ-
ing direct support professionals, is expected 
to grow more than any other occupation in 
the United States; 
Whereas 
many 
direct 
support 
profes-
sionals— 
(1) are the primary financial providers for 
their families; 
(2) are hardworking, taxpaying citizens 
who provide a critical service in the United 
States; and 
(3) continue to earn low wages, receive in-
adequate benefits, and have limited opportu-
nities for advancement, resulting in high 
turnover and vacancy rates that adversely 
affect the quality of support, safety, and 
health of individuals with disabilities; and 
Whereas the Supreme Court of the United 
States, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 
(1999)— 
(1) recognized the importance of the dein-
stitutionalization of, and community-based 
services for, individuals with disabilities; 
and 
(2) held that, under the Americans with 
Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S. 12101 et seq.), 
a State must provide person-centered, com-
munity-based service options to individuals 
with intellectual and developmental disabil-
ities: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates the week beginning Sep-
tember 11, 2022, as ‘‘National Direct Support 
Professionals Recognition Week’’; 
(2) recognizes the dedication and vital role 
of direct support professionals in enhancing 
the lives of individuals with disabilities; 
(3) appreciates the contribution of direct 
support professionals in supporting individ-
uals with disabilities and their families in 
the United States; 
(4) commends direct support professionals 
for being integral to the provision of long- 
term support and services for individuals 
with disabilities; 
(5) encourages the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics of the Department of Labor to collect 
data specific to direct support professionals; 
and 
(6) finds that the successful implementa-
tion of public policies affecting individuals 
with disabilities in the United States can de-
pend on the dedication of direct support pro-
fessionals.

Whereas the Senate is committed to the 
use of forensic science in the investigation of 
crimes, the prosecution and conviction of the 
correct perpetrators of crimes, and the exon-
eration of innocent individuals falsely ac-
cused of crimes in the United States; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
address critical questions in civil and crimi-
nal investigations and trials in the United 
States, including by providing scientific con-
clusions relating to forensic evidence; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
partner with— 
(1) Federal agencies to build and maintain 
criminal databases relating to latent prints, 
DNA, and other information relevant to 
criminal cases; and 
(2) Federal, State, and local agencies to en-
sure public safety; 
Whereas forensic science service providers 
serve a vital role in the criminal justice sys-
tem by providing scientific information to 
investigators and officers of the court; and

free baseball clinics for underprivileged chil-
dren in numerous communities; 
Whereas, on September 30, 1972, for the 
3,000th and final regular season hit of his il-
lustrious career, Clemente hit a 4th-inning 
double against the New York Mets at the 
Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh, Penn-

DAY’’ 
AND CELEBRATING THE SIGNING 
OF THE CONSTITUTION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 770 
Whereas the Constitution of the United 
States (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Constitution’’) is the supreme law of the 
United States; 
Whereas the Constitution enshrines the 
freedom of the people of the United States; 
Whereas the Constitution forms a more

Constitution are limited government, sepa-
ration of powers, individual liberty, and rule 
of law; 
Whereas the Constitution establishes jus-
tice, ensures domestic tranquility, provides

of the civil authority; 
Whereas the Constitution affirms that the 
Government of the United States exists to 
serve its citizens; 
Whereas the Constitution grants power to 
a national, Federal Government while pre-
serving fundamental, individual rights; 
Whereas the Constitution separates the 
power of the Federal government into 3 
branches: executive, judicial, and legislative; 
Whereas the powers of each branch of the 
Federal Government are delegated in the 
Constitution, with powers not assigned to 
the branches reserved to the States; 
Whereas the Constitution grants the exec-
utive power to the President; 
Whereas the Constitution does not allow 
the President to enact national policies in 
areas that are reserved solely to Congress 
under the Constitution; 
Whereas the Constitution grants judicial 
power to the Supreme Court and inferior 
courts that Congress may ordain and estab-
lish; 
Whereas justices and judges have constitu-
tional limits on their power; 
Whereas an activist judiciary that usurps 
powers reserved to the people through other 
branches of government is a threat to the 
United States; 
Whereas the judiciary should interpret 
laws as written by Congress rather than al-
lowing executive agencies to rewrite those 
laws to suit a political agenda; 
Whereas the Constitution grants all legis-
lative powers to Congress, which consists of 
a Senate and a House of Representatives; 
Whereas the Constitution assigns to Con-
gress the responsibility for organizing the 
executive and judicial branches, raising rev-
enue, declaring war, and making all laws 
necessary for executing these powers; 
Whereas it is a breach of trust for Congress 
to delegate excessive legislative authority to 
executive departments, agencies, and com-
missions, thus empowering the administra-
tive state instead of the elected representa-
tives of the people of the United States; 
Whereas the Constitution protects the de-
mocracy of the United States; 
Whereas elections are a vital component of 
democracy; 
Whereas the Constitution states that the 
times, places, and manner of holding elec-
tions for Senators and Representatives shall 
be prescribed in each State by the legislature

dural rules, including the length of debate; 
Whereas no one may unilaterally rewrite 
or otherwise impugn the validity of the text 
of the Constitution; 
Whereas the Constitution can only be 
changed by amendment; 
Whereas an amendment to the Constitu-
tion may be proposed by a 2⁄3 vote of both 
Houses of Congress, or, if 2⁄3 of the States re-
quest an amendment, by a convention called 
for that purpose; 
Whereas an amendment to the Constitu-
tion must be ratified by 3⁄4 of the State legis-
latures or 3⁄4 of conventions called in each 
State for ratification; 
Whereas, according to the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution— 
(1) Congress shall make no law respecting 
an establishment of religion or prohibiting 
free exercise of religion; and

September 15, 2022 
Whereas, according to the Second Amend-
ment to the Constitution, the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms shall not be in-
fringed; 
Whereas Congress may not pass laws that 
deny or abridge any constitutional rights; 
Whereas it is unconstitutional for the Fed-
eral Government to wield its authority be-
yond the scope of power delegated to it or to 
use that authority as a political weapon 
against the rights of States to pass voter 
identification laws, oversee the health care 
of their citizens, draft curricula, and craft 
other laws and policies consistent with the 
Constitution; 
Whereas constitutional rights are not ne-
gotiable; 
Whereas all legislation, regulations, and 
official actions should conform to the origi-
nal meaning of the Constitution as under-

Whereas the Constitution was written dur-
ing the Philadelphia Convention, now known

vened from May 25 to September 17, 1787; and

SEC. 153. TREATMENT OF NUCLEAR MODERNIZA-
TION 
AND 
HYPERSONIC 
MISSILE 
PROGRAMS WITHIN DEFENSE PRI-
ORITIES AND ALLOCATIONS SYSTEM. 
(a) SENSE OF SENATE.—It is the sense of the 
Senate that— 
(1) the United States is entering into an 
unprecedented period of strategic competi-
tion with two potential adversaries, each of 
which now possesses, or will acquire, nuclear 
and missile forces equal to or greater than 
such forces possessed by the United States; 
(2) ensuring the continued deterrence of 
the growing threat of the nuclear capabili-
ties of such adversaries requires— 
(A) safe, secure, effective, and credible nu-
clear forces, with a range of flexible employ-
ment options, available to the President; and 
(B) robust missile forces capable of over-
coming current and future missile defenses; 
(3) such forces can only be achieved 
through the rapid and complete moderniza-
tion of legacy nuclear capabilities of the 
United States and the timely development of 
a range of ballistic, cruise, and hypersonic 
boost-glide missiles; 
(4) ongoing Department of Defense and Na-
tional Nuclear Security Administration pro-
grams and projects to achieve the mod-
ernization of United States nuclear forces 
enjoy virtually no scheduled margin for de-
livery prior to the expected retirement or de-
commissioning of legacy systems and facili-
ties, even as the People’s Republic of China, 
the Russian Federation, and North Korea 
work to rapidly modernize and expand their 
nuclear arsenals; 
(5) the People’s Republic of China, the Rus-
sian Federation, and North Korea are— 
(A) engaged in a variety of missile pro-
grams intended to defeat the missile defense 
capabilities of the United States and its al-
lies; and 
(B) expected to field such capabilities in 
greater volumes than the United States; 
(6) imbalances in such capabilities are in-
herently destabilizing and represent pro-
found risks to the security of the United

case of any capability that, as determined in 
writing by the Secretary of Defense, is ur-
gently needed to eliminate a documented de-
ficiency that has resulted in combat casual-

ties, the Secretary may use the procedures

the Secretary of Defense shall seek to enter 
into a contract with one or more federally 
funded research and development centers to 
conduct a study on the proposed reorganiza-
tion of the Space Force and the establish-
ment of the Space Component. 
(b) ELEMENTS.—The study referred to in 
subsection (a) shall include a comprehensive 
review and assessment of— 
(1) the feasibility and advisability of— 
(A) exempting the proposed Space Compo-
nent from the existing ‘‘up or out’’ system of 
officer career advancement first established 
by the amendments to title 10, United States 
Code, made by the Defense Officer Personnel 
Management Act (Public Law 96–513; 94 Stat. 
2835); 
(B) combining active and reserve compo-
nents in a new, single Space Component and 
whether a similar outcome could be achieved 
using the existing active and reserve compo-
nent frameworks with modest statutory 
changes to allow reserve officers to serve on 
sustained active duty; 
(C) creating career flexibility for reserve 
members of the Space Component, including 
in shifting retirement points earned from 
one year to the next and allowing members 
of the Space Component to move back and 
forth between active and reserve status for 
prolonged periods of time across a career; 
(2) the implications of the proposed reorga-
nization of the Space Force on the develop-
ment of space as a warfighting domain in the 
profession of arms, particularly with respect 
to officer leadership, development, and stew-
ardship of the profession; 
(3) whether existing government ethics 
regulations are adequate to address potential 
conflicts of interest for Space Component of-
ficers who seek to move back and forth be-
tween sustained active duty and working for 
private sector organizations in the space in-
dustry as reserve officers in the Space Com-
ponent; 
(4) whether the proposed Space Component 
framework is consistent with the joint serv-
ice requirements of chapter 38 of title 10, 
United States Code; 
(5) budgetary implications of the establish-
ment of the Space Component; 
(6) the nature of the relationship with pri-
vate industry and civilian employers that 
would be required and consistent with pro-
fessional ethics to successfully implement 
the Space Component; and 
(7) any other issues the Secretary or the 
federally funded research and development 
center considers relevant. 
(c) DIVERSITY
AND INCLUSION.—The study 
referred to in subsection (a) shall include an 
assessment of the proposed reorganization of 
the Space Force and the establishment of the 
Space Component on advancing diversity and 
inclusion in the Space Component.

(4) since the Secretary of the Air Force 
says the Air Force cannot afford to allocate 
advanced capabilities across all ranges, the

bility to conduct advanced F–35 training.

sionalism during the conduct of effective, ef-
ficient, and decisive military operations 
around the world in defense of the people of 
the United States; and 
(B) go to great lengths to minimize civil-
ian harm during the conduct of military op-
erations; and 
(2) the Russian Federation has dem-
onstrated a complete disregard for the safety 
of 
civilians 
during 
its 
unlawful 
and 
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, which has 
involved indiscriminate bombing of civilian 
areas and executions of noncombatants. 
(b) REPORT.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the

SEC. 1237. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE NORTH 
ATLANTIC TREATY ORGANIZATION. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the success of the North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization (NATO) is critical to ad-
vancing United States national security ob-
jectives in Europe and around the world; 
(2) NATO remains the strongest and most 
successful military alliance in the world, 
founded on a commitment by its members to 
uphold the principles of democracy, indi-
vidual liberty, and the rule of law; 
(3) the contributions of NATO to the col-
lective defense are indispensable to the secu-
rity, prosperity, and freedom of its members; 
(4) the United States reaffirms its ironclad 
commitment— 
(A) to NATO as the foundation of trans-
atlantic security; and 
(B) to upholding the obligations of the 
United States under the North Atlantic 
Treaty, done at Washington, DC, April 4, 
1949, including Article 5 of the Treaty; 
(5) the 2022 National Defense Strategy cor-
rectly highlights the criticality of alliances 
and partnerships, stating that ‘‘[m]utually- 
beneficial alliances and partnerships are an 
enduring strength for the United States, and 
are critical to achieving our objectives, as 
the unified response to Russia’s further inva-
sion of Ukraine has demonstrated’’; 
(6) the Russian Federation’s premeditated 
and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine poses 
the most direct threat to security and sta-
bility in Europe since the end of World War 
II and requires the full attention of the 
NATO alliance; 
(7) the unprovoked and illegal war con-
ducted by the Russian Federation against 
Ukraine has fundamentally altered the con-
cept of transatlantic security and requires— 
(A) a reinvigorated commitment to the 
shared principles of the NATO alliance; and 
(B) a commensurate response to deter fur-
ther revanchism by the Russian Federation 
in the Euro-Atlantic region; 
(8) as NATO refocuses its deterrence and 
defense posture to respond to the Russian 
Federation’s escalatory actions, allies must 
simultaneously address threats posed across 
all domains and all areas of the Euro-Atlan-
tic region, including— 
(A) threats posed by predatory investments 
and influence operations carried out by the 
People’s Republic of China; 
(B) border disruptions emanating from 
Belarus; and 
(C) the persistent threat of violent extrem-
ist organizations; 
(9) to respond to aggression by the Russian 
Federation and address other threats, the 
NATO alliance should— 
(A) assess opportunities to further bolster 
the NATO enhanced Forward Presence and 
enhanced Vigilance Activity battlegroups; 
(B) focus efforts on burden sharing agree-
ments made in the Wales Pledge, capability 
targets, contributions to NATO missions and 
operations, and resilience commitments; 
(C) consider force posture adjustments to 
address emerging security concerns high-
lighted by the Russian Federation’s invasion 
of Ukraine; 
(D) explore additional opportunities to 
strengthen 
cooperation 
with 
non-NATO 
countries to counter malign activities car-
ried out by the Russian Federation; 
(E) continue efforts to identify, coordinate, 
and deliver humanitarian aid and security 
assistance to Ukraine; 
(F) intensify efforts to work with NATO al-
lies to establish and enhance rapid and as-
sured movement of military forces through-
out the North Atlantic region and across the 
continent of Europe on land, on and under 
the sea, and in the air, including through in-
creased investment, coordination, and stand-
ardization intended to identify and reduce 
obstacles to the movement of United States 
and allied military forces in a time of crisis 
or conflict; 
(G) reaffirm the open-door policy of NATO 
to allow any European country to apply for 
membership and be considered on its merits 
for admission, including— 
(i) aspirants such as Ukraine, Georgia, and 
Bosnia and Herzegovina; and 
(ii) Finland and Sweden, which in the wake 
of the Russian Federation’s invasion of 
Ukraine, have sought NATO membership to 
further bolster their own security and the se-
curity of the Euro-Atlantic region; and 
(H) continue efforts to evaluate whether 
the NATO alliance is sufficiently funded and 
resourced to carry out its objectives; 
(10) the United States and fellow NATO al-
lies should continue long-term efforts—

vilians and members of the military forces of

PORTING PRIORITIZATION OF THE 
PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE

It is the sense of the Senate that the Sen-
ate— 
(1) supports the designations by the De-
partment of Defense, as reflected in the 2022 
National Defense Strategy and statements 
by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and 
other senior Department officials, of— 
(A) the People’s Republic of China as the 
Department’s pacing challenge; 
(B) the Indo-Pacific as the Department’s 
priority theater; and 
(C) a Taiwan contingency as the Depart-
ment’s pacing scenario; 
(2) underscores the importance of the De-
partment continuing to prioritize the deter-
rence of aggression by the People’s Republic 
of China, particularly in the form of an inva-
sion of Taiwan by the People’s Republic of 
China, as the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China expands and modernizes the 
People’s Liberation Army; and 
(3) strongly urges the Department to man-
age force allocations across theaters to en-
sure, consistent with the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), 
that the United States Armed Forces main-
tain the ability to deny a fait accompli 
against Taiwan by the People’s Republic of 
China in order to deter the People’s Republic 
of China from using force to unilaterally 
change the status quo with Taiwan. 
SEC. 1252. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON DEFENSE AL-
LIANCES 
AND 
PARTNERSHIPS 
IN 
THE INDO-PACIFIC REGION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The United States Indo-Pacific strategy 
states, ‘‘we will prioritize our single greatest 
asymmetric strength: our network of secu-
rity alliances and partnerships. Across the 
region, the United States will work with al-
lies and partners to deepen our interoper-
ability and develop and deploy advanced 
warfighting capabilities as we support them 
in defending their citizens and their sov-
ereign interests.’’. 
(2) The fact sheet accompanying the Na-
tional Defense Strategy states, ‘‘[m]utually- 
beneficial Alliances and partnerships are an 
enduring strength for the United States, and 
are critical to achieving our objectives . . . 
the Department [of Defense] will incorporate 
ally and partner perspectives, competencies,

and advantages at every stage of defense 
planning.’’. 
(3) Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
General Milley testified on April 7, 2022, that 
‘‘our alliances and partnerships are our most 
significant asymmetric advantages and are 
key to maintaining the international rules- 
based order that offers the best opportunities 
for peace and prosperity for America and the 
globe.’’. 
(4) Commander of the United States Indo- 
Pacific Command Admiral Aquilino testified 
on March 10, 2022, that ‘‘a key U.S. asym-
metric advantage that our security chal-
lengers do not possess is our network of 
strong alliances and partnerships. Because 
these relationships are based on shared val-
ues and people-to-people ties, they provide 
significant advantages such as long-term 
mutual trust, understanding, respect, inter-
operability, and a common commitment to a 
free and open Indo-Pacific.’’. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the Secretary of Defense 
should continue efforts that strengthen 
United States defense alliances and partner-
ships in the Indo-Pacific region so as to fur-
ther the comparative advantage of the 
United States in strategic competition with 
the People’s Republic of China, including 
by— 
(1) enhancing cooperation with Japan, con-
sistent with the Treaty of Mutual Coopera-
tion and Security Between the United States 
of America and Japan, signed at Washington, 
January 19, 1960, including by developing ad-
vanced military capabilities, fostering inter-
operability across all domains, and improv-
ing sharing of information and intelligence; 
(2) reinforcing the United States alliance 
with the Republic of Korea, including by 
maintaining the presence of approximately 
28,500 members of the United States Armed 
Forces deployed to the country and affirm-
ing the United States commitment to ex-
tended deterrence using the full range of 
United States defense capabilities, con-
sistent with the Mutual Defense Treaty Be-
tween the United States and the Republic of 
Korea, signed at Washington, October 1, 1953, 
in support of the shared objective of a peace-
ful and stable Korean Peninsula; 
(3) fostering bilateral and multilateral co-
operation with Australia, consistent with 
the Security Treaty Between Australia, New 
Zealand, and the United States of America, 
signed at San Francisco, September 1, 1951, 
and through the partnership among Aus-
tralia, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States (commonly known as ‘‘AUKUS’’)— 
(A) to advance shared security objectives; 
(B) to accelerate the fielding of advanced 
military capabilities; and 
(C) to build the capacity of emerging part-
ners; 
(4) advancing United States alliances with 
the Philippines and Thailand and United 
States partnerships with other partners in 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
to enhance maritime domain awareness, pro-
mote sovereignty and territorial integrity, 
leverage technology and promote innova-
tion, and support an open, inclusive, and 
rules-based regional architecture; 
(5) broadening United States engagement 
with India, including through the Quadrilat-
eral Security Dialogue— 
(A) to advance the shared objective of a 
free and open Indo-Pacific region through bi-
lateral and multilateral engagements and 
participation in military exercises, expanded 
defense trade, and collaboration on humani-
tarian aid and disaster response; and 
(B) to enable greater cooperation on mari-
time security and the threat of global 
pandemics, including COVID–19; 
(6) strengthening the United States part-
nership with Taiwan, consistent with the 
Three Communiques, the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.), 
and the Six Assurances, with the goal of im-
proving Taiwan’s asymmetric defensive ca-
pabilities and promoting peaceful cross- 
strait relations; 
(7) reinforcing the status of the Republic of 
Singapore as a Major Security Cooperation 
Partner of the United States and continuing 
to strengthen defense and security coopera-
tion between the military forces of the Re-
public of Singapore and the Armed Forces of 
the United States, including through partici-
pation in combined exercises and training; 
(8) engaging with the Federated States of 
Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Is-
lands, the Republic of Palau, and other Pa-
cific Island countries, with the goal of 
strengthening regional security and address-
ing issues of mutual concern, including pro-
tecting fisheries from illegal, unreported, 
and unregulated fishing; 
(9) collaborating with Canada, the United 
Kingdom, France, and other members of the 
European Union and the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization to build connectivity 
and advance a shared vision for the region 
that is principled, long-term, and anchored 
in democratic resilience; and 
(10) investing in enhanced military posture 
and capabilities in the area of responsibility 
of the United States Indo-Pacific Command 
and strengthening cooperation in bilateral 
relationships, multilateral partnerships, and 
other international fora to uphold global se-
curity and shared principles, with the goal of 
ensuring the maintenance of a free and open 
Indo-Pacific region.

ON 
NUCLEAR 
COOPERATION 
BE-

(a) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) the United States strategic nuclear de-
terrent, and the independent strategic nu-
clear deterrents of the United Kingdom and 
the French Republic, are the supreme guar-
antee of the security of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘NATO’’) and continue to underwrite 
peace and security for all members of the 
NATO alliance; 
(2) the security of the NATO alliance also 
relies upon nuclear sharing arrangements 
that predate, and are fully consistent with, 
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nu-
clear Weapons, done at Washington, London, 
and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into 
force March 5, 1960 (commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty’’); 
(3) such arrangements provide for the for-
ward deployment of United States nuclear 
weapons in Europe, along with the sup-
porting 
capabilities, 
infrastructure, 
and 
dual-capable aircraft dedicated to the deliv-
ery of United States nuclear weapons, pro-
vided by European NATO allies;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4720 
September 15, 2022 
(4) in parallel to the independent commit-
ments of the United States and the United 
Kingdom to the enduring security of NATO, 
the nuclear programs of the United States 
and the United Kingdom have enjoyed sig-
nificant collaborative benefits as a result of 
the cooperative relationship formalized in 
the Agreement for Cooperation on the Uses 
of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Pur-
poses, signed at Washington July 3, 1958, and 
entered into force August 4, 1958, between 
the United States and the United Kingdom 
(commonly referred to as the ‘‘Mutual De-
fense Agreement’’); 
(5) the unique partnership between the 
United States and the United Kingdom has 
enhanced sovereign military and scientific 
capabilities, strengthened bilateral ties, and 
resulted in the sharing of costs; 
(6) as the international security environ-
ment deteriorates and potential adversaries 
expand and enhance their nuclear forces, the 
extended deterrence commitments of the 
United Kingdom play an increasingly impor-
tant role in supporting the security interests 
of the United States and allies of the United 
States and the United Kingdom; 
(7) additionally, the extension of the nu-
clear deterrence commitments of the United 
Kingdom to members of the NATO alliance 
strengthens collective security while reduc-
ing the burden placed on United States nu-
clear forces to deter potential adversaries 
and assure allies of the United States; 
(8) it is in the national security interest of 
the United States to support the United 
Kingdom with respect to the decision of the 
Government of the United Kingdom to main-
tain its nuclear forces to deter countries 
that are ‘‘significantly increasing and diver-
sifying their nuclear arsenals’’ and ‘‘invest-
ing in novel nuclear technologies and devel-
oping new ‘warfighting’ nuclear systems’’ 
that could threaten NATO allies, as outlined 
in the March 2021 report of the Government 
of the United Kingdom entitled, ‘‘Global 
Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated 
Review of Security, Defence, Development 
and Foreign Policy’’; 
(9) as the United States continues to mod-
ernize its aging nuclear forces to ensure its 
ability to continue to field a nuclear deter-
rent that is safe, secure, and effective, the 
United Kingdom faces a similar challenge; 
(10) bilateral cooperation on such programs 
as the Trident II D5 weapons system, the 
common missile compartment for the future 
Dreadnought and Columbia classes of sub-
marines, and the parallel development of the 
W93/Mk7 warhead of the United States and 
the replacement warhead of the United King-
dom, will allow the United States and the 
United Kingdom to responsibly address chal-
lenges within their legacy nuclear forces in a 
cost-effective manner that— 
(A) preserves independent, sovereign con-
trol; 
(B) is consistent with each country’s obli-
gations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty; and 
(C) supports nonproliferation objectives; 
and 
(11) continued cooperation between the nu-
clear programs of United States and the 
United Kingdom is essential to ensuring that 
the NATO alliance continues to be supported 
by credible nuclear forces capable of pre-
serving peace, preventing coercion, and de-
terring aggression. 
(b) BRIEFING.—Not later than March 4, 2023, 
the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisi-
tion and Sustainment shall brief the Com-
mittees on Armed Services of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives on opportuni-
ties to further enhance and strengthen the 
bilateral partnership between the nuclear en-
terprises of the United States and the United 
Kingdom, including potential cooperation in 
areas 
such 
as 
advanced 
manufacturing, 
microelectronics, supercomputing, and pro-
duction modernization.

Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Secretary of the Senate 
be authorized to request the House of 
Representatives to return the papers 
on S. 1198; further, upon receipt of the 
bill from the House, the Senate’s ac-

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I

further consideration, and the Senate 
now proceed to S. Res. 755. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 755) recognizing Sep-
tember 11, 2022, as a ‘‘National Day of Serv-
ice and Remembrance’’. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent the resolution be agreed to, the 
preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 755) was

(The resolution, with its preamble, is

f 
NATIONAL DIRECT SUPPORT PRO-
FESSIONALS RECOGNITION WEEK 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed immediately to consider-
ation of S. Res. 767, which was sub-
mitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 767) designating the 
week beginning September 11, 2022, as ‘‘Na-
tional Direct Support Professionals Recogni-
tion Week’’. 
There being no objection, the Senate

on September 11, 2022, as National Di-
rect Support Professionals Recognition 
Week. Direct support professionals as-
sist millions of individuals living with 
disabilities to perform a wide range of

September 15, 2022 
essential daily tasks such as meal prep-
aration, transportation, and medica-
tion management. Direct support pro-
fessionals provide critical home- and 
community-based 
services—HCBS— 
that allow individuals to stay con-
nected with their communities. 
As 
direct 
support 
professionals 
stepped up during the pandemic and 
provided care while facing increased 
personal risks as frontline workers, 
many faced long-standing difficulties 
such as inadequate wages and benefits. 
These challenges disproportionately af-
fect racial and ethnic minorities, who 
comprise 62 percent of the home care 
workforce, which includes direct sup-
port professionals. These issues have 
led to high turnover and vacancy rates, 
contributing to a growing shortage of 
direct support professionals. 
Even as this shortage persists and 
millions of jobs in the field remain 
open, demand for direct support profes-
sionals is expected to increase by at 
least 1.4 million new direct care jobs by 
2026, according to PHI. An insufficient 
number of direct support professionals 
will likely mean longer wait lists for 
individuals seeking assistance, force 
providers to turn away new referrals, 
or discontinue programs and services. 
These circumstances hurt quality of 
care and put further stress on family 
caregivers. 
Under President Biden’s leadership, 
we have taken steps to invest in home- 
and 
community-based 
services 
by 
building up the home care workforce 
and expanding access to care. I am 
proud to have voted for the American 
Rescue Plan Act, which—among many 
critical provisions—included $12.7 bil-
lion for HCBS. I am also a cosponsor of 
the Better Care Better Jobs Act, which 
would build on the funding from Amer-
ican Rescue Plan Act by continuing en-
hanced Medicaid funding for HCBS for 
States that expand access to these 
services and invest in the workforce, 
such as the direct support profes-
sionals. 
It is more important than ever that 
we take the time to recognize the work 
of those who choose to be direct sup-
port professionals. I would like to con-
gratulate two Marylanders who were 
recognized this year for their work as 
direct 
support 
professionals: 
Maria 
Swift of Penn-Mar Humans Services re-
ceived the American Network of Com-
munity Options and Resources’ Na-
tional Direct Support Professional of 
the Year Award and Tammy Wright of 
Consumer Direct Care Network re-
ceived the Maryland State award. 
Maria and Tammy are making an enor-
mous difference and I appreciate their 
service to others. I would also like to 
thank Senators Collins, Blumenthal, 
Brown, Casey, Kaine, King, Klobuchar, 
Menendez, Smith, Van Hollen, and 
Warren for joining me in showing our 
appreciation for direct support profes-
sionals across the Nation and recog-
nizing the essential role they play in 
our healthcare system. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I further ask that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble 
be agreed to, and the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 767) was 
agreed to. 
The preamble was agreed to. 
(The resolution, with its preamble, is 
printed in today’s RECORD under ‘‘Sub-
mitted Resolutions.’’)

RECOGNIZING 
AND 
SUPPORTING 
THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NA-

FORENSIC

WEEK 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of S. Res. 768, 
submitted earlier today. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the resolution 
by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 768) recognizing and 
supporting the goals and ideals of National 
Forensic Science Week. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent the resolution be agreed to, the 
preamble be agreed to, and that the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table with no 
intervening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The resolution (S. Res. 768) was

f 
ORDERS FOR MONDAY, 
SEPTEMBER 19, 2022 
Mr. SCHUMER. And, finally—I thank 
again my colleagues from Oklahoma 
and Nebraska—I ask unanimous con-
sent that when the Senate completes 
its business today, it adjourn until 3 
p.m. on Monday, September 19, and 
that following the prayer and the 
pledge, the morning hour be deemed 
expired, the Journal of proceedings be 
approved to date, the time for the two 
leaders be reserved for their use later 
in the day, and morning business be 
closed; that upon the conclusion of 
morning business, the Senate proceed 
to executive session to resume consid-
eration of the Pan nomination; further, 
that the cloture motions filed during 
today’s session ripen at 5:30 p.m.; fi-
nally, that if any nominations are con-
firmed during Monday’s session, the 
motions to reconsider be considered 
made and laid upon the table and the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. If there is no further 
business to come before the Senate, I 
ask that it stand adjourned under the 
previous order, following the remarks

ABRAHAM ACCORDS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 2 
years ago, almost to the exact mo-
ment, I was sitting on the south lawn 
of the White House in the blazing Sun, 
where a redhead should never sit, get-
ting a sunburn, on a hot September day 
in DC, watching leadership of the UAE, 
Bahrain, Israel, and the United States 
all shake hands and sign an agreement 
called the Abraham Accords. It was a 
remarkable moment in American his-
tory. 
We have become so accustomed in 
the last 2 years to this conversation 
about the Abraham Accords, we lose 
track that it was just 2 years ago that 
we had one of the greatest break-
throughs in Middle East peace that we 
have had in decades. 
In 1979, Egypt and Israel came to-
gether for a peace agreement under 
President Jimmy Carter and the Camp 
David Accords. In 1994, Jordan and 
Israel normalized relationships under 
President Clinton. But for 26 years, 
there were no additional peace agree-
ments and, quite frankly, very few con-
versations even. It stopped. All the 
conversation among foreign affairs was 
that you had to resolve the Palestinian 
conflict before anything else could be 
resolved in the Middle East, and for 26 
years, all the focus was on that. 
The Trump administration came in 
and put the whole thing on its head and 
said: What if? What if we work towards 
peace agreements outside of the Pales-
tinian conversation? If we set that 
aside, could we still normalize agree-
ments? 
Again, most people said: No, that is 
not possible—until 2 years ago today. 
Two years ago today, when the leaders 
of UAE, Bahrain, Israel, and the United 
States met together and signed an 
agreement, they started not just a 
process, they started a conversation 
and a dialogue. They shook hands and 
signed an agreement that had remark-
able statements in it about religious 
liberty that we look at and think: The 
Arab world would not sign that, but 
they did, quite frankly, because people 
hadn’t asked them to. 
There were conversations and agree-
ments made about energy policy, about 
economic development in a region of 
the world that many would say that no 
one will ever meet and this will never 
get better. 
President Reagan once said: 
Our involvement in the search for Middle 
East peace is not a matter of preference; it is 
a moral imperative.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4806 
September 15, 2022 
We are a people of peace. We are a 
people, as a nation, passionate about 
religious liberty. We are a people who 
want to see a nation joining other na-
tions in economic development. It is 
who we are. It is who we have been 
from the beginning, and we are at our 
best when we are expanding that. 
Since the signing of that document, 
several things have happened in that 2- 
year time period. 
The first thing that happened, really, 
was that in October of 2020, Sudan 
raised their hand and said: I want to 
join that agreement. Then, in Decem-
ber of 2020, Morocco raised their hand 
and said: I want to be in that agree-
ment. It quickly went from four na-
tions to five, to six, all in this ongoing 
dialogue about peace in the region. 
The countries have exchanged Am-
bassadors since then. Again, that may 
not sound revolutionary, but it is in 
that region. The UAE, Morocco, and 
Bahrain all opened up Embassies in 
Israel—again, 
revolutionary. 
Israel 
opened up its Embassy—the first ever 
in the Gulf nations—in Abu Dhabi in 
January of 2021. It opens up its next 
Embassy in Bahrain in September of 
2021. 
The UAE and Israel have signed com-
prehensive 
free-trade 
agreements. 
There is now $10 billion worth of trade 
in the next 5 years that has been set up 
between 
those 
nations. 
Trade 
has 
begun between Israel and Morocco. In 
fact, it has increased 94 percent in a 
year. Trade between the UAE and 
Israel has increased 88 percent in 1 
year. Trade between Israel and Egypt, 
even, has increased 41 percent in the 
last year and between Israel and Jor-
dan, with a longstanding agreement, 
has increased 55 percent. 
The UAE and Morocco now have uni-
versity students who are studying in 
Israeli 
universities—something 
we 
thought we would never see. The UAE 
has overhauled its school curriculum 
to 
increase 
tolerance 
and 
under-
standing of other faiths and other reli-
gious groups. 
Dozens of daily flights are now mov-
ing in those Abraham Accord coun-
tries, bringing business and tourism. 
There are even real conversations 
about water, about energy sharing and 
development and large economic infra-
structure projects. 
There are other countries, even, in 
the region that have started to take 
notice of this. Countries like Saudi 
Arabia are now allowing Israeli-bound 
flights to fly through Saudi airspace. 
Now, again, that may not seem revolu-
tionary to some, that planes get to fly 
over them, but, you understand, 2 years 
ago, that didn’t happen. The Saudis 
made every Israeli-bound flight go 
around their airspace. Israel and Saudi 
Arabia have also participated in multi-
lateral naval and air drills, alongside 
UAE, Bahrain, and other countries. It 
is an enormous shift. 
If I can even say this in the region, 
Israel and Lebanon are very close right 
now to forming an agreement on what 
they call the Blue Line, the border be-
tween Israel and Lebanon, including 
the maritime areas. What does that 
matter? It is a tremendous develop-
ment for Lebanon, for their economic 
development, because there is a large 
natural gas field just off of Lebanon’s 
coast, but the border has been unre-
solved for years. 
In the conflict between nations and 
the trust that has collapsed, the Abra-
ham Accords have provided an oppor-
tunity and a moment for the nations in 
the region to say: If peace can begin 
with UAE and Bahrain and Sudan and 
Morocco and Israel and recognition and 
economic 
development 
and 
Ambas-
sadors can be exchanged, who else can 
engage in economic development? 
Let’s start with their neighbor Leb-
anon. To build trust is to also build 
clear borders. This is real progress in 2 
years. 
My challenge to the administration 
and to our State Department is, fan 
the flame. Keep going on this. We have 
seen nations begin to do economic de-
velopment, 
families 
meeting 
other 
families, school curriculum changing 
to taking out anti-Semitic tropes, basi-
cally, out of their curriculum. We have 
seen real progress in this area. Keep 
going. Other nations should be wel-
comed to be able to join in the Abra-
ham Accords. It is not closed. Other 
nations can join in that economic de-
velopment. 
There are four of us who began the 
Abraham Accords Caucus: myself, Sen-
ator ROSEN, Senator ERNST, and Sen-
ator BOOKER. We launched out the four 
of us and invited all of our colleagues 
to be able to join into it. Our focus is 
to be able to work with the Ambas-
sadors of those nations to say: How can 
we partner together to bless what has 
already occurred, and how can we ex-
pand into other nations? How can we 
encourage increased economic develop-
ment? 
Now, there are still very real chal-
lenges. The work is not done by any 
means, but it has at least begun, and 
progress is taking off—this simple prin-
ciple of economic engagement, going 
past all of the government noise and 
saying: What if we allowed infrastruc-
ture to be able to work together? What 
if we allowed tourism to be able to hap-
pen? What if we allowed businesses to 
work with other businesses in other na-
tions that used to be hostile? How can 
we engage in such a way that would 
help? 
The four of us in the Abraham Ac-
cords Caucus brought to the floor 
today a resolution to recognize this 2- 
year anniversary. It sat before all 100 
Senators, and I don’t know a single 
Senator who is opposed to that because 
we all want to see peace in the Middle 
East. We all want to see that kind of 
progress, and we all want to see this in-
crease. 
So, to our State Department, keep 
the work going. Keep the conversation 
going. To nations around the world 
that used to be hostile to Israel and the 
region, why don’t we set down the past 
and prepare our families for the future? 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
f 
INFLATION 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, first, I 
would like to associate myself with the 
comments of the Senator from Okla-
homa and thank him for all of the 
work he has done on this. 
The Abraham Accords are really 
something to celebrate, something that 
we should be building on. And there is 
not a lot of good news right now on a 
whole bunch of scores, and this is 
worth celebrating. So commendations 
on your resolution. 
Something we shouldn’t be cele-
brating is inflation, and I wasn’t in-
vited, but it looks like there was one 
heck of a party this week at the White 
House. 
In case folks missed it, President 
Biden, 
Majority 
Leader 
SCHUMER, 
Speaker PELOSI, and others gathered 
on the south lawn of the White House 
on Tuesday afternoon to clink cham-
pagne glasses and celebrate the so- 
called Inflation Reduction Act, passed 
along straight party lines last month. 
James Taylor even flew in for the fes-
tivities. 
But at the same time that Wash-
ington politicians were patting them-
selves on the back, here is actual re-
ality—not Orwellian rhetoric, not sort 
of made-up names for legislation to 
spend hundreds and hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars—here is actual reality: 
Americans are getting slapped in the 
face with yet another month of bad 
news. Core inflation grew another six- 
tenths of a percent just in the month of 
August, defying even the most pessi-
mistic estimations and analyses head-
ing into those reporting numbers. 
Both the Dow and the S&P had their 
worst day since the very arrival of 
COVID. 
Consumer prices are now up 8.3 per-
cent for the year, but it is worse than 
that for median-income households in 
America. Grocery prices are 13 percent 
more expensive this middle of Sep-
tember than they were the last middle 
of September. 
How do you think about what 13 per-
cent inflation looks like? Here is the 
way I explained it to my kids: You 
know, if a year ago today, you went to 
the grocery store checkout line and 
you had $100 in your pocket and you 
had a cart full of groceries and you 
paid your $100 for the $100 of groceries, 
if you showed up today at the checkout 
line at the grocery store with the exact 
same cart and the exact same hundred 
bucks, you would then have to awk-
wardly and in an embarrassed way, in 
front of the people behind you in line, 
say: I have to figure out how to take 
$13 of stuff off this checkout line be-
cause the $100 that I had last year that 
bought $100 of food only buys $87 of 
food right now. That is what 13 percent 
inflation means.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4807 
September 15, 2022 
Even CNN had to admit that the 
White House’s timing was awkward, 
calling the event ‘‘a bizarre split- 
screen moment,’’ with President Biden 
taking a victory lap with a so-called 
Inflation Reduction Act while in the 
real world, inflation was tanking mar-
kets. That was actually what was hap-
pening on Tuesday. On air, the CNN an-
chor suggested it ‘‘feels a little hard to 
be celebratory.’’ That is a kind of awk-
ward, timid way to tell the truth. 
Lots of Americans have become used 
to this split-screen reality where Wash-
ington says one thing, but reality is 
completely different. It often feels like 
officials in Washington are living alter-
nate realities and then trying to con-
vince the American people: You don’t 
know what you are talking about. 
What you are actually experiencing at 
the checkout line when you had to put 
back $13 of groceries—it is not really 
true. The great news is, we have wine 
glasses in our hands; let’s clink them 
together. 
Washington, DC, is obviously in a 
bubble—and not for the first time. The 
same folks who threw that party are 
the types who order lots of their food 
from DoorDash and therefore might ac-
tually not know what the price of eggs, 
milk, and meat is. They are the kind of 
folks who see inflation as something 
that happens on paper, but seeing it on 
paper is different than feeling it. 
DC sees many problems on paper but 
doesn’t really connect with what the 
American people are living. DC saw the 
housing crisis of 2008, 2009 as something 
on paper, not as reality. Why? Well, be-
cause five of the seven richest counties 
in America are the five suburban coun-
ties of Northern Virginia and Maryland 
that ring Washington, DC. Think about 
that. Of 3,000 counties in America, 5 of 
the 7 richest ones are the places that 
surround the city. 
So in 2008, 2009, when housing was 
collapsing everywhere, when lots of 
people were going bankrupt in the 
country, people in this city said: I 
don’t know what the heck you are 
talking about. We have massive de-
mand. Houses sell with escalation 
clauses. 
There are way more buyers than 
there are sellers, so housing prices in 
Washington, DC, in Northern Virginia, 
and in suburban Maryland went up 
even as the country was living that 
collapse. 
Opioids are a crisis that a lot of peo-
ple in Washington, DC, know only on 
paper because they don’t see it around 
the yuppified neighborhoods of Wash-
ington, DC. 
Inflation is now that kind of crisis. It 
is a very real thing, and yet people in 
this city host white wine parties to 
talk about how great it is passing leg-
islation that spent hundreds of billions 
of dollars more, accelerating inflation, 
and they decided they would name it 
the ‘‘Inflation Reduction Act.’’ 
Let’s review a little bit of history 
about what we have learned about in-
flation over the last 15 months. 
More than a year ago, last summer, 
when Americans were already feeling 
their prices creep higher, the President 
dismissed long-term worries about in-
flation with this quote: 
There’s nobody suggesting there’s any un-
checked inflation on the way—no serious 
economist. 
What? 
That was an incredibly bizarre, dis-
honest statement, and everyone knew. 
When 
it 
was 
spoken 
and 
when 
speechwriters wrote it, they knew that 
that wasn’t true. 
Why did they know? Well, because in-
flation had gone from 1.4 to 5.5 percent 
in the 3 months before that statement 
was uttered. 
Larry Summers, a longtime Demo-
cratic economist across multiple ad-
ministrations and who is well respected 
by folks in academia and in govern-
ment and in both parties, was scream-
ing at the White House not just in pri-
vate but in public that this was non-
sense, that they were delusional about 
what was happening with inflation 
numbers. Yet our President said that 
there was nobody suggesting that un-
checked inflation was on the way—no 
serious economist. 
Here is what was actually happening 
in White House meeting rooms at that 
time. Half of the Obama economic 
team was coming in and telling the 
Biden economic team: Hey, you guys 
are going to get caught with your 
pants down. That isn’t true. That spin 
isn’t reality. Inflation is big, it is bad, 
and it is growing. 
Yet the speechwriters said: Let’s 
have the President go out to the po-
dium and say there is no serious econo-
mist who believes inflation is coming. 
That was in July of 2021. 
In February of this year, when infla-
tion had hit 7.8 percent, our President 
predicted that ‘‘inflation ought to be 
able to start to taper off as we go 
through this year.’’ He had predicted in 
December that inflation had already 
peaked. Every one of these comments 
was detached from reality, and the peo-
ple writing the speeches knew they 
were detached from reality. 
The President is obviously not the 
only offender. Last October, with high 
prices already eating away at families’ 
savings accounts, White House Chief of 
Staff Ron Klain applauded a tweet de-
scribing inflation and supply chain 
snarls as ‘‘high-class problems.’’ That 
is some white wine-drunk commentary 
for you. This is a middle-class Amer-
ican problem that families in all 50 
States are suffering. 
A week later, the White House Press 
Secretary shrugged off the same prob-
lem when asked about inflation as 
being ‘‘the tragedy of the treadmill 
that’s delayed.’’ ‘‘The tragedy of the 
treadmill that’s delayed’’—ouch. 
Do these people know anyone in 
America who has ever had to put stuff 
back at the checkout line at the gro-
cery store? Because that is what I have 
experienced and see at Walmart and 
Hy-Vee right now in Fremont, NE. 
Have they ever sat down with people 
to compare their receipts week over 
week or month over month—those peo-
ple who are looking at their receipts, 
knowing that they have to put stuff 
back? They are not wrong, and they are 
not talking about a 3-month delay on a 
Peloton delivery. 
Just 2 months later, another White 
House Press Secretary declared that 
the United States is ‘‘stronger eco-
nomically than we have ever been in 
our history.’’ That is what was said at 
the White House podium: ‘‘stronger 
economically than we have ever been 
in our history’’—totally drunk stuff. 
According to a Gallup poll, 56 percent 
of Americans now say price increases 
are causing financial hardships for 
their families. That is up from 49 per-
cent a couple of months ago and 45 per-
cent the previous fall. 
According to a Monmouth poll, near-
ly 9 out of 10 Americans say the coun-
try is on the wrong track, but the 
White House is throwing wine and 
cheese parties to celebrate the Infla-
tion Reduction Act. 
Americans have watched the Presi-
dent announce that he plans to force 
noncollege graduates in Scottsbluff, 
NE, and Beckley, WV, to pay for the 
debt burden of people with masters and 
Ph.D.s who live in Berkeley and Be-
thesda. Let’s be clear. Fifty-six percent 
of all of the student loan debt in Amer-
ica is held by people with graduate de-
grees. The majority of college loan 
debt in America is held by people with 
graduate degrees, and about a third of 
Americans go to college. But what we 
should do, Washington says, is take 
money from noncollege graduates and 
give it to folks with graduate degrees. 
Then let’s claim it is somehow going to 
reduce the deficit. Drunk stuff. 
Americans have watched as every 
basic household necessity has become 
more expensive, from groceries to gas. 
Then they hear politicians change the 
name of their bill to the Inflation Re-
duction Act and applaud themselves for 
spending hundreds of billions of infla-
tionary dollars. This was on the steps 
of the White House on Tuesday after-
noon. 
Folks, this isn’t just offensive; it is 
the kind of behavior and the kind of 
dishonesty that poisons democracy. 
Politicians are saying things here that 
are 180 degrees reversed from reality, 
and that cuts to the issue of public 
trust. It doesn’t just matter economi-
cally; it matters civically. 
The relationship between the Amer-
ican people and their leaders is a rela-
tionship built on trust—a trust that, 
when elected officials are at their 
desks in Washington, takes seriously 
the needs and desires of their constitu-
ents. We have a bunch of people in 
Washington, DC, who mistake the 
Washington, 
DC, 
elite 
experience, 
where the income of folks who work for 
the Federal Government is substan-
tially higher than that of the median 
American. It attacks public trust. 
Elected officials are not special. Elect-
ed officials, quite frankly, are often

not that impressive. Elected officials 
are not demagogues. Public servants 
are supposed to be serving the public. 
It is in our job description to trust 
that the people we represent actually 
know something about their struggles 
and their challenges and their day-to- 
day difficulties of making ends meet. It 
is in our job description to listen to 
them, to look at their experiences, and 
to take them to heart. It is in our job 
description to think carefully about 
the challenges they face and the ways 
we can address those challenges, al-
ways with a mindful eye to the direc-
tion established by our constitutional 
order and the best of our democratic 
traditions. 
That relationship is destroyed when 
Washington, DC, breaks faith with the 
American people, when it declares: You 
don’t know what you are talking 
about. You don’t know what your expe-
rience is at the grocery store checkout 
line. There is no serious inflation, and 
no serious economist thinks inflation 
is coming. 
The actual numbers are 13 percent 
grocery and 81⁄2 percent overall. These 
are late 1970s kinds of numbers. 
Politicians know best. 
No, we don’t. 
The relationship is destroyed when 
self-satisfied appointees and smug bu-
reaucrats in Washington bustle up and 
down Pennsylvania Avenue and decide 
that division is more efficient politics 
than competent governance. Lectures 
about the soul of America ring pretty 
hollow from practitioners of this cra-
ven kind of politics of contempt. 
Americans deserve better. Starting 
with honesty is a pretty good start. 
Here is honesty: We have an infla-
tionary crisis on our hands, and the re-
ality is that inflation is making life a 
lot more difficult and a lot more pre-
carious for millions and millions of our 
neighbors. Our families and friends are 
feeling pain at the pump and at the 
checkout lines. They are watching 
their savings accounts and pensions be 
nibbled away. They haven’t imagined a 
hardship. This is reality—experiential 
and economic reality. 
The only thing that is misaligned is 
the rhetoric of this place, and Ameri-
cans won’t be bludgeoned into believ-
ing that they are actually thriving 
when they are experiencing 13 percent 
grocery inflation. Things are hard, and 
the barest minimum this White House 
could do is to admit it, to tell the 
truth, and to put away the party hats. 
The American people are resilient. 
We are tough. We are not ready to ac-
cept this as the new normal. We are 
going to work our way through this, 
but we need less condescension and less 
spin. We need a lot more truth-telling 
from those in power. We need fewer 
tone-deaf, wine-glass-clinking parties 
from folks who have escalated inflation 
with 
reckless 
spending 
and 
then 
claimed that the American people are 
wrong and that this new spending will 
somehow reduce inflation. Nobody real-
ly believes that. 
The folks who are writing those press 
releases and those speeches and invit-
ing people to parties at the White 
House should reconsider. They should 
tell the truth. It is hogwash, and they 
know it. More importantly, the Amer-
ican people know it, and we should tell 
them the truth.

IN RECOGNITION OF LT. COL. 
JASON CULLINANE 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. KEATING. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of Lt. Col. Jason Cullinane as 
he retires from the U.S. Army after three dec-
ades of service. 
Raised in Falmouth, Massachusetts, Jason 
Cullinane had a passion for running from a 
young age. One of the seven ‘‘Running 
Cullinanes,’’ Lt. Col. Cullinane ran in multiple 
Falmouth Road Races, served as captain of 
the Falmouth High School cross country team, 
and was named a Boston Globe All Scholastic 
and Cape Cod Times All Star athlete. 
After 
graduating 
from 
Falmouth 
High 
School, Lt. Col. Cullinane went on to receive 
his Bachelor of Science in communications 
media from Fitchburg State University, where 
he was also a four-time NCAA All American in 
track and field. At Fitchburg State University, 
Lt. Col. Cullinane began what would be an ex-
tensive career with the U.S. Army, joining his 
school’s Army Reserve Officers Training 
Corps program in 1989. 
Following graduation, Lt. Col. Cullinane 
served his country and continued his passion 
for running, competing as an athlete for the 
U.S. Army multiple times at the International 
Military Sports Council (CISM). Lt. Col. 
Cullinane also ran in the 1996 Olympic trials 
in steeplechase and came in ninth at the 1998 
U.S. Track and Field Championship. He then 
went on to run professionally for Reebok Bos-
ton and the Nike Farm Team, and wrote 
LogbookONE, a running training manual. 
Following the attacks on September 11, 
2001, Lt. Col. Cullinane returned to the U.S. 
Army and has been on active duty since. Dur-
ing his many years of service, Lt. Col. 
Cullinane was deployed to Bosnia, Afghani-
stan, and Iraq, managed training operations at 
several military bases, served as a policy ana-
lyst at the Pentagon, and received a master’s 
degree in strategic studies from the United 
States Army War College. 
After officially retiring from the U.S. Army 
this September, Lt. Col. Cullinane plans to 
spend ample time with his daughters, Niamh 
and Mayumi, and coach Falmouth Youth Run-
ning and the Falmouth Academy cross country 
team. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Lt. 
Col. Jason Cullinane. I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing his career and commit-
ment to serving his community and country. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA HOME RULE EX-
PANSION ACT OF 2022 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Home Rule 
Expansion Act of 2022, which would expand 
D.C.’s authority to govern its local affairs. Spe-
cifically, the bill would give D.C. the authority 
to prosecute and grant clemency for all D.C. 
crimes and eliminate the congressional review 
period for D.C. legislation. 
D.C. should—and will—be a state. However, 
until Congress grants D.C. statehood, there is 
no constitutional or policy reason Congress 
should not pass this bill. This bill is about local 
control over local affairs. It does nothing more 
than give D.C. the same authorities states and 
territories have over certain local govern-
mental functions. Under the Constitution, Con-
gress has plenary authority over both D.C. 
and the territories. It has already used its ple-
nary authority to give the territories the self- 
governing authorities this bill would give D.C. 
First, this bill would give D.C. the authority 
to prosecute all crimes committed under its 
laws. Congress already lets D.C. write D.C. 
criminal laws, and lets D.C. enforce them 
against some violators. Congress should let 
D.C. enforce them against all violators. This 
provision would effectuate a 2002 advisory ref-
erendum, approved by 82 percent of D.C. vot-
ers, to create a local prosecutor’s office. 
Currently, the U.S. Attorney for D.C. has the 
authority to prosecute most D.C. crimes com-
mitted by adults and some by juveniles, while 
the D.C. Attorney General has the authority to 
prosecute most D.C. crimes committed by ju-
veniles and some by adults. Giving D.C. the 
authority to prosecute all D.C. crimes would 
not only give D.C. residents a say in the en-
forcement of all their laws, it also would save 
the federal government tens of millions of dol-
lars a year by reducing the number of assist-
ant U.S. attorneys in the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for D.C. 
Second, this bill would give D.C. the author-
ity to grant clemency for crimes committed 
under D.C. laws, as Congress previously has 
done. Currently, the President exercises the 
authority to grant clemency for D.C. crimes, 
though almost never grants it. D.C. residents 
deserve a say in whether their fellow residents 
deserve mercy. 
Finally, this bill would eliminate the congres-
sional review period for D.C. legislation. D.C. 
legislation takes effect after a congressional 
review period, unless a joint resolution of dis-
approval is enacted into law during the review 
period. The review process imposes significant 
costs on both D.C. and Congress, but only 
three D.C. disapproval resolutions have been 
enacted since passage of the D.C. Home Rule 
Act, and none since 1991, more than 30 years 
ago. Yet, the D.C. Council has had to develop 
a Kafkaesque legislative process to comply 
with the review period, often having to pass 
the same bill multiple times. Congress loses 
nothing by eliminating the abandoned con-
gressional review period. Congress can legis-
late on any D.C. matter at any time, and has 
done so many times outside of the review pe-
riod, such as through the appropriations proc-
ess. 
The congressional review period (30 days 
for civil bills and 60 days for criminal bills) in-
cludes those days when either house of Con-
gress is in session, delaying D.C. bills from 
becoming law, often for many months. The 
delay forces the D.C. Council to pass most 
bills several times, using a cumbersome and 
complicated process to ensure that the oper-
ations of this large city continue uninterrupted. 
The congressional calendar means that a 30- 
day period usually lasts a couple of months 
and often much longer because of congres-
sional recesses. 
Placing a congressional hold on D.C. bills 
has not only proven unnecessary, but has im-
posed costs on the D.C. government, resi-
dents and businesses. District residents and 
businesses are also placed on hold because 
they have no certainty when D.C. bills, from 
taxes to regulations, will take effect, making it 
difficult to plan. It is particularly unfair to re-
quire the D.C. Council to engage in this un-
necessary, labor-intensive and costly process 
to no effect. 
I urge my colleagues to support this impor-
tant bill.

RECOGNIZING THE RIVERTON 
PEACE POLE COALITION 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the Riverton Peace 
Pole Coalition as they celebrate the United 
Nations’ International Day of Peace. 
Since 
1981, 
people 
and 
organizations 
across the world commemorate this day in the 
hope of strengthening the prospect of peace. 
For New Jersey’s 3rd District and beyond, this 
day of non-violence and cease-fire serves as 
a reminder for us to continuously strive for 
equality and justice. Now more than ever, our 
role on the world stage is magnified and our 
leadership in promoting international peace 
will be a positive influence in countries and 
cultures across the globe. 
This year’s International Day of Peace 
theme, ‘‘End Racism. Build Peace,’’ is a re-
minder for us of how dismantling racism both 
in our own homes and overseas can positively 
impact people of color and other minority com-
munities. We are at a pivotal point in history 
where internal divisions resulting from discrimi-
nation and racism have become more com-
mon and violent than in recent years. Fol-

of numerous social movements fighting for 
change, we have seen how conflicts around 
the world can affect some racial minorities 
harder than others. In keeping with the United 
Nations’ values on this day, we recognize 
each of us can contribute to a future built on 
the premises and promises of human rights, 
everywhere. 
I am incredibly humbled by what the coali-
tion members in New Jersey’s 3rd District are 
doing today to honor our commitment to build 
stronger communities and extend hope for 
empathy internationally. As they prepare to 
honor the United Nation’s call for peace, I ex-
tend my best wishes to everyone in this dis-
trict for doing their part to spread positivity and 
peace.

HONORING AND CELEBRATING 
EDWIN J. ‘DICK’ MORRIS, JR. 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Edwin J. ‘Dick’ Morris, 
Jr. of Peculiar, Missouri, in celebration of his 
100th birthday on September 16, 2022. 
Mr. Morris still lives at his home in Peculiar 
and continues to live life to the fullest. He 
makes weekly trips to visit his wife, Maxine, at 
her nursing home in nearby Harrisonville, and 
stays independent, still doing his own cooking, 
cleaning, and even mowing his own lawn. 
Although his independence and drive today 
is inspiring, Edwin Morris is nothing short of 
an American Hero. Drafted in 1942, Morris 
served his country with the Forest Rangers, 
Coast Guard, Air Force and 442nd Signal Bat-
talion. Joining the Armed Services at the same 
time as his brother, Morris first spent time on 
the West Coast as part of the Forest Rangers 
and Coast Guard and was then shipped out to 
New Guinea at the beginning of 1943 when 
they declared independence. He then spent 
the latter half of the war in Japan. Morris’s 
service didn’t stop after WWII; after returning 
home to his farm in Missouri for a few years, 
he reenlisted in the spring of 1951 to serve in 
the Korean War, where he worked with the 
only B–36 bomber in the area. After his serv-
ice in the Korean War, Morris became a farm-
er and tractor salesman, and now spends his 
time visiting with friends and family at the 
Belton Senior Center. 
Today, there are very few WWII Veterans 
like Edwin still with us, making the celebration 
of his service and this milestone in his life 
even 
more 
admirable. 
Mr. 
Morris 
is 
undoubtably an American Hero and Treasure, 
and this country is better for people like him. 
Please join me in recognizing Edwin and wish-
ing him a very happy 100th birthday.

Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, my first vote 
on September 13, 2022, was not cast because 
of a proxy vote communications error. Further, 
my letter sent to the Clerk of the U S. House 
of Representatives on September 13, 2022, 
altered my proxy designation before Role Call 
No. 421, which was received and verified pur-
suant to H. Res. 8. Had I been present, I

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
MEMORY 
OF 
OFFICER 
BLAIZE MADRID-EVANS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with an aching in my heart as Missouri’s 
Fifth Congressional District marks a somber 
occasion. I rise to honor and celebrate the life 
of Officer Blaize Alyxander Madrid-Evans, a 
22-year-old member of the Independence Po-
lice Department who was killed one year ago 
today while responding to a call. Independ-
ence lost an incredible young man who 
wished to dedicate his life to protecting and 
serving everyday people as a police officer. 
Today, on this painful anniversary, we reflect 
on the selflessness and courage that Officer 
Madrid-Evans displayed throughout his 22 
years of life. 
Blaize Madrid-Evans was born on June 2, 
1999 in North Kansas City, Missouri. Blaize 
grew up in Kansas City up until his senior year 
of high school. In 2018, he graduated from 
Smithville High School. He then began work-
ing for the American Medical Response (AMR) 
as an Emergency Responder, where he re-
mained for nearly two years. In July 2021, 
Blaize graduated from the Police Academy 
and started his tour with the Independence 
Police Department. Sadly, Officer Madrid- 
Evans’ tour would last only two months. 
Officer Madrid-Evans is remembered as 
being a sharp-dressed coffee connoisseur who 
loved going out to eat, playing computer 
games, and putting Sriracha on all sorts of 
foods. Blaize was an organ donor, and in the 
year since his passing, he has saved seven 
lives and enhanced another thirty-seven. 
Through the donation of his corneas, skin, 
muscles, tendons, bones, and other tissues, 
the Midwest Transplant Team estimates that 
Blaize will impact the lives of up to seventy- 
five people. In one instance, Blaize’s kidney 
was donated to a fellow police officer in 
Springfield, Missouri who was critically injured 
in the line of duty. Even after ending his 
watch, Blaize has continued to make his chari-
table presence felt through acts of service and 
sacrifice. Blaize’s life came to an end far too 
soon, but in his death, he has bestowed the 
gift of life upon others. He would not want it 
any other way. He was a beloved son, broth-
er, fiance´, friend, and police officer. According 
to his family, Blaize was loving, kind, respect-
ful, and brought joy to all those who had the 
privilege of knowing him. He was a bright light 
in his loved ones’ lives and has been missed 
terribly this past year. 
On September 15, 2021, a tragedy oc-
curred, and Blaize’s life was cut short by an 
act of senseless, indescribable violence. When 
news broke that Officer Madrid-Evans had 
passed away, all of the Greater Kansas City 
Area grieved alongside his family, friends, and 
fellow officers. As we spend this day in loving 
remembrance, I keep all those who had the 
privilege of knowing Blaize Madrid-Evans in 
my thoughts and prayers. As I have been told, 
to know Blaize was to love him, and I am 
deeply saddened to have never met this fine 
young man. I mourn with Blaize’s long list of 
family and friends. No parent or grandparent 
should have to outlive their child or grandchild. 
I truly hope that the love and support that 
Independence and the surrounding areas have 
offered has brought some comfort into their 
lives. Blaize was so loved. 
Officer Madrid-Evans was awarded the high-
est form of recognition from the Independence 
Police Department, the Medal of Valor on 
March 25, 2022. The medal is a profound 
honor given only to officers that display ex-
traordinary acts of heroism and courage that 
go above and beyond the call of duty. Addi-
tionally, Officer Madrid-Evans was added to 
the Smithville Education Foundation’s Wall of 
Fame in February of 2022. These tributes can-
not heal the loss of Blaize, but they are sym-
bols of gratitude for his distinguished service 
and boundless bravery. 
When tragedies like this occur, it is difficult 
to comprehend the loss we all feel. In times 
like these, I am called to Scripture. Matthew 
5:1–3 says, ‘‘Blessed are the poor in spirit, for 
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Let us find 
solace in the word of God and remember that 
we will be reunited, once more, in the King-
dom of Heaven.’’ 
Today, my thoughts—and the thoughts of 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District—are 
with Officer Madrid-Evans’ family. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in honoring the life 
and everlasting legacy of Blaize Alyxander 
Madrid-Evans. Let us admire the fearlessness 
of Officer Blaize Madrid-Evans while never for-
getting the sacrifice he made in the name of 
protecting others.

NEW FEDERAL COURT OPENS IN 
THE MARIANAS 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, on Sep-
tember 16, the United States District Court for 
the Northern Mariana Islands will be officially 
moved into its new courtroom and offices in 
Gualo Rai on the island of Saipan. The U.S. 
Pretrial and Probation Office, the U.S. Mar-
shals Service, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and 
the Federal Protective Service are also now 
housed in this new building, leased by the 
General Services Administration from Mari-
anas Management Corporation for the next 
twenty years. 
To commemorate this move I want to add to 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD a history of the 
federal court in the Marianas, which is part of 
the ongoing story of how the people I rep-
resent have become members of the Amer-
ican political family and have been included in 
the institutions of the United States govern-
ment. 
I am indebted to the research of Ms. Lallane 
Guiao-Seng, MPA, who formerly interned with 
the Marianas congressional office and is now 
Generalist Clerk for the U.S. District Court.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E939 
September 15, 2022 
with 
extensive 
captioning 
recounting 
the 
court’s history for the ceremonial opening of 
the new courthouse this month. I am also in-
debted to Chief Judge Ramona V. Manglona, 
who agreed to allow Ms. Guiao-Seng to share 
her research with the congressional office. 
That work is extensively excerpted here. 
Section 401 of the Covenant to Establish a 
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Is-
lands in Political Union with the United States 
of America, which the people of the Mariana 
approved in a plebiscite in 1975 and Congress 
agreed in Public Law 94–241 in 1976, pro-
vides that the United States will establish a 
District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. 
The United States fulfilled this commitment in 
1977 with enactment of Public Law 95–157 
establishing the District Court under Article IV 
of the U.S. Constitution. 
According to the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee report that accompanied this legislation, 
establishment of the court was a legislative 
priority during the 95th Congress (1977–78). 
The Committee noted, in part, that 
After the Constitution [of the Northern 
Mariana Islands] becomes effective, it will 
take 
the 
legislature 
an 
undetermined 
amount of time to create the local court au-
thorized by the Constitution and to establish 
it as a functioning branch of the local gov-
ernment. Transitional provisions of the con-
stitution will enable the current, local 
courts to hear and determine cases that will 
be within the limited jurisdiction of the 
Commonwealth trial court. However, unless 
the District Court for the Northern Mariana 
Islands is established by S. 2149 in this ses-
sion of Congress, there will be no court in 
the Northern Mariana Islands to hear serious 
criminal and important civil cases, arising 
under local law. Moreover, there would be no 
court to hear cases involving Federal ques-
tions or Federal crimes, and there would be 
no appellate tribunal. 
Consequently, the committee recognized 
‘‘the urgent need for enactment of S. 2149 in 
this session of the Congress and, therefore, 
the committee reports the bill favorably with a 
recommendation that it do pass.’’ The legisla-
tion did pass the Senate on October 13, 1977, 
and the House on October 25. President Car-
ter signed the bill on November 8 of that year. 
In addition to establishing a judgeship for 
the court and assigning it to the same judicial 
circuit as Guam (which, at present, is the 
Ninth Circuit), the legislation also authorized 
the President to appoint a U.S. attorney and a 
marshal for the Northern Mariana Islands. The 
legislation also granted the court the same ju-
risdiction as a U.S. district court (i.e., district 
courts authorized under Article III of the Con-
stitution). The Chief Judge of the Ninth Judi-
cial Circuit was empowered to assign certain 
persons ‘‘to serve temporarily as a judge in 
the District Court for the Northern Mariana Is-
lands whenever such an assignment is nec-
essary for the proper dispatch of the business 
of the court.’’ 
Quickly, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Judi-
cial Circuit did assign three senior federal 
judges and the new Northern Mariana Islands 
District Court received its first case filings on 
January 9, 1978. Quickly, too, President 
Jimmy Carter nominated Alfred Laureta, who 
hailed from Hawaii, to be the district judge. He 
was confirmed by the Senate on May 17, 
1978. 
The new courthouse and federal office 
building we are celebrating today is a far cry 
from quarters that Judge Laureta confronted, 
when he arrived on the island of Saipan in the 
Marianas in August of 1978. ‘‘The Court con-
vened in a poolside suite at the Saipan Beach 
Intercontinental Inn in the village of Garapan. 
The district judge’s law clerk’s office was ten 
yards from the Intercontinental swimming pool 
and thirty yards from the beach. The court-
room itself was set up at the end of the ban-
quet room, which could be closed off from the 
rest of the room and then opened for jury 
trials,’’ according to the research of Ms. 
Guiao-Seng. 
Mr. Howard K.K. Luke, Judge Laureta’s law 
clerk, recalled this scene when he and the 
judge first arrived: 
Saipan had just had the heaviest rainfall in 
recent recorded history. The first thing we 
saw upon arriving at the Saipan Interconti-
nental Inn was a car that was mostly under-
water. The District Court was in a small 
room that had been hastily repaired, as it 
was heavily damaged from a fire from the 
kitchen area next to it not long before our 
arrival. We found a metal desk that served as 
the federal bench for the next several 
months. 
Despite these less than imposing cir-
cumstances, the court got to work. And for the 
next eight years, the District Court heard both 
federal cases and the most serious local 
cases, including criminal cases with penalties 
of five years imprisonment or more and civil 
cases dealing with amounts in controversy of 
over $5,000. All jury trials also fell under the 
jurisdiction of the District Court. 
As Ms. Guaio-Seng recounts, the Federal 
District Court also served as the appellate 
court for the Commonwealth Trial Court. 
‘‘Cases appealed from [the Trial Court] were 
heard by a panel of three judges on the ‘Ap-
pellate Division’ of the District Court. The 
panel included the U.S. district judge for the 
NMI, a judge of the Commonwealth Trial 
Court, and another federal district judge as-
signed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit. The opinions rendered by this 
appellate arm of the District Court for the 
[Northern Mariana Islands] were appealable to 
the Ninth Circuit.’’ 
The federal government also had begun ne-
gotiations for a more appropriate setting in 
which the District Court could convene. In 
1981, after three makeshift years at the hotel, 
space was rented at the newly opened Nauru 
Building, a seven-story commercial venture of 
the Republic of Nauru, to accommodate the 
needs of the federal court, including a small 
courtroom, library, judge’s chambers, and staff 
offices. 
Judge Laureta’s 10-year term ended in 1988 
at which time President Ronald Reagan nomi-
nated Alex R. Munson to be District Court 
judge for the Northern Mariana Islands. Judge 
Munson was familiar with the region having 
served as the Chief Judge for the High Court 
of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, 
which encompassed the Marianas as well as 
Palau, Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae, and the 
Marshall Islands. Munson also initiated a relo-
cation of the court to more spacious accom-
modations in the Horiguchi Building. The 
courtroom was located on the ground floor, 
the Clerk’s Office and Judge’s Chambers on 
the second floor, and a grand jury room on the 
third floor. 
Within ten years, however, this space, too, 
proved inadequate. ‘‘In the wake of the 1998 
Oklahoma City federal courthouse bombing, a 
Federal Assessment Board determined that 
the courtroom in the Horiguchi Building was 
the least safe courthouse in the nation,’’ Ms. 
Guaio-Seng reports. As a result, the General 
Services Administration decided to build a new 
federal building in Saipan, but Congress 
balked at the cost. 
Not until 2010, when a drunk driver veered 
off the road and crashed a 16-passenger van 
into the Horiguchi Building courtroom, did the 
federal government agree that a more secure 
facility was required. Yet seven more years 
passed before the General Services Adminis-
tration finally contracted with the Marianas 
Management Corporation on a construct/lease 
arrangement for a new federal court building. 
Construction dragged out in the aftermath of 
Super Typhoon Yutu in 2018 and during the 
COVID–19 pandemic; but in early 2020 the 
District Court began its move to the new court-
house. The first judicial proceeding there took 
place on July 14, 2020. And this week we cel-
ebrate the official grand opening. 
Throughout the last four decades, the U.S. 
District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands 
and the U.S. judicial system have played a 
pivotal role in the life of our community. The 
case of Commonwealth v. Atalig established 
the right to a jury trial for defendants facing a 
substantial period of incarceration. Wabol v. 
Villacrusis let stand the land alienation restric-
tions in the Commonwealth Constitution. And 
the court presided over the conviction of a Lt. 
Governor on charges of corruption. 
The court is also the venue for the swearing 
in of new U.S. citizens, a regular and inspira-
tional event I have many times attended. 
The federal court is a focal point of local 
pride, too. Though the first two judges were 
off-islanders, in 2011 President Barack Obama 
nominated Ramona V. Manglona, a person of 
Northern Marianas descent, to the bench; and 
the U.S. Senate confirmed her that year. It is 
my sincere hope that President Biden will ac-
knowledge the exceptional work of Chief 
Judge Manglona and nominate her for a sec-
ond, 10-year term. 
In the meantime, I join Judge Manglona, her 
staff, and the members of the U.S. Pretrial 
and Probation Office, the U.S. Marshals Serv-
ice, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Federal 
Protective Service in celebrating their new 
workspace. 
As so many Americans individually did and 
our governmental and civil institutions, as well, 
the U.S. District Court made substantial ad-
justments in practice to continue functioning 
during the pandemic. In-person proceedings 
were discontinued, trials and grand jury ses-
sions were held remotely. Eventually, how-
ever, and with the cautions we have become 
accustomed to—N95 masks and other per-
sonal protective equipment—the court was 
able to hold an in-person jury trial last year, In 
part, the 35,696 square-feet of space provided 
by the new Gualo Rai courthouse made the 
necessary social distancing feasible. The de-
sign is also forward-looking in its incorporation 
of innovative lighting and landscaping; and en-
ergy efficient fixtures and wastewater tech-
nologies are projected to realize future cost 
savings and conserve resources. 
So, the grand opening celebration this week 
is more than just a ribbon cutting. It has the 
feel of a return to normalcy. It is a new nor-
mal, however, enhanced by a fine new facility 
ready to serve the cause of justice in the 
Northern Mariana Islands.

HONORING LES CLARK II ON HIS 
SELECTION 
AS 
KERN 
COUNTY 
FAIR PERSON OF THE YEAR FOR 
2022 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with my colleague, Congressman 
DAVID VALADAO, to honor Les Clark on his se-
lection as the 2022 Kern County Fair Person 
of the Year. This significant achievement 
builds upon Les’ incredible legacy of 50 years 
of community service, which has been recog-
nized by the City of Taft, the Kern County 
Board of Supervisors, and the State of Cali-
fornia. 
Nearly five years ago, Congressman DAVID 
VALADAO and I rose to recognize and pay trib-
ute to Les on his retirement as Executive Vice 
President of the Independent Oil Producers’ 
Agency after 37 years of dedicated service to 
hardworking local oil producers. In that state-
ment, we spoke to Les’ character, drive, 
knowledge of the Kern oil patch, and vision for 
our community. And most importantly, we at-
tested to his life of service, which has never 
stopped, even after his official retirement. That 
is why Congressman VALADAO and I are proud 
to see Les being honored at this year’s Kern 
County Fair. 
Dating back to 1916, the Kern County Fair 
has a rich history that cuts across generations 
and brings Californians together to celebrate 
all Kern County has to offer. During the 12 
days of festivities, community members have 
the opportunity to play carnival games, eat 
barbeque, and listen to lively music, including 
the famous ‘‘Bakersfield Sound.’’ It is also 
where our next generation of agricultural pro-
ducers exhibit a variety of their livestock 
showings, 
demonstrating 
their 
husbandry 
skills. With Les being recognized as Person of 
the Year at this year’s fair, his name will for-
ever be tied to the Kern County Fair’s rich his-
tory and all that it represents in our community 
and across the Central Valley. 
On behalf of the 23rd and 21st Congres-
sional Districts of California, Congressman 
VALADAO and I would like to thank Les for the 
impact he has made and continues to make 
on countless individuals, both professionally 
and privately, and congratulate him on receiv-
ing this special recognition. We wish him and 
his family, including his wife, June, two daugh-
ters, Tessa and Kerrie, son ‘‘Little Les,’’ ten 
grandchildren, Arizona, Ayana, Cash, Darius, 
Easton, Keylan, Logun, Sierra, Tanisha, and 
Willow, and six great grandchildren, Zaria, Ivy, 
Koast, River, Luka, and Kaisley the very best 
as they celebrate at this year’s fair.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE RITZ 
THEATER’S 115TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, today 
I honor the Ritz Theater on its 115th anniver-
sary. The occasion was marked with a ribbon 
cutting, birthday cake, and historic tour on 
September 2, 2022. 
In 1906, Italian immigrant and talented wax 
modeler S.Z. Poli built the Ritz Theater—then 
called the Poli—for $250,000. The grand the-
ater could seat more than 2,000 theatergoers 
in its orchestra, balcony, and second story bal-
cony. On Labor Day 1907, the theater opened 
its doors as Scranton’s premier vaudeville the-
ater and attracted some of the biggest names 
in the industry including Harry Houdini, W.C. 
Fields, and Will Rogers. News stories from the 
time reported a young Buster Keaton tended 
bar across the street in between perform-
ances. The reputation of the theater and the 
superstars who performed on its stage 
sparked the popular saying ‘‘if you can play 
Scranton, you can play anywhere.’’ 
On October 6, 1930, the theater began 
screening films and was rebranded as the Ritz 
Theater. In 1937, the theater was remodeled 
in the Art Deco style; the second story balcony 
was removed; and it was again renamed and 
became the Comerford Theater. By 1941, the 
theater was managed by the legendary Para-
mount Pictures, Inc. through their subsidiary, 
Frank Walker. The theater was once again re-
modeled, and on May 5, 1950, the theater re-
opened with a screening of Paid in Full which 
starred Scranton’s own Lizabeth Scott. 
Over the next several decades, the theater 
thrived, drawing crowds of moviegoers down-
town, but when the theater began to struggle 
financially, the main floor was converted into a 
mini mall in 1978 with the theater operations 
relocating to the former balcony. As competi-
tion from two multiplexes continued to mount, 
the Ritz shifted to showing short-run movies, 
and in July 2000, ‘‘U–571’’ was the last film 
shown before the theater closed. 
In the early 2000s, the building was pur-
chased, and the buyer found many of the 
treasures of the theater’s heyday still intact. In 
2016, the Creative and Performing Arts Acad-
emy of NEPA, an arts program for kids, teens, 
and adults, took up residence in the Ritz. 
Today, more than 300 students attend classes 
in music, theater, and dance and participate in 
more than 24 annual productions. The Ritz 
also houses the Ritz Mainstage Players, a 
semi-professional, 
audition-based 
company 
that performs musicals and plays. 
Through triumphs and challenges, the Ritz 
Theater has been a beacon for the arts in 
downtown Scranton for more than a century, 
and I admire the ingenuity and determination 
it took to preserve its legacy. I am honored to 
join with everyone at the Ritz Theater to cele-
brate their 115th anniversary. May they con-
tinue to find great success and welcome audi-
ences through their doors for many years to 
come.

CELEBRATING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
SOJOURNER 
TRUTH 
HOUSE 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure and admiration that I recognize 
Sojourner Truth House as the organization 
celebrates its 25th anniversary. In honor of 
this momentous occasion, Sojourner Truth 
House will celebrate with a special event tak-
ing place on Sunday, September 18, 2022, at 
Avalon Manor in Merrillville, Indiana. 
Sojourner Truth House, located in Gary, In-
diana, is a ministry organization sponsored by 
Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ which pro-
vides shelter, support, and hope for homeless 
and at-risk women and children. The compas-
sionate employees and volunteers at So-
journer Truth House assist and encourage 
their clients to regain their dignity and sense 
of purpose for themselves, their children, and 
their communities. The organization is dedi-
cated to its mission which includes an empha-
sis on dignity and respect for all, strength in 
diversity and inclusion, and fostering a safe 
environment for its clients to identify and over-
come the barriers in their lives. In addition, the 
organization is proud to provide numerous 
programs that have been immensely success-
ful and provide clients with access to re-
sources, classes, counseling, and various ac-
tivities aimed at healing the mind, body, and 
spirit. For its noteworthy and lifelong positive 
impact on the community of Gary and the en-
tirety of Northwest Indiana, Sojourner Truth 
House is worthy of the highest praise. 
I would be remiss if I did not recognize 
some of the inspiring leaders in Northwest In-
diana who have worked with Sojourner Truth 
House to bring about impactful change and to 
inspire the community. They include Sister 
Joan Fisher, PHJC, Sister Peg Spindler, CSA, 
Executive Director Angela Paul, Chairperson 
Scott 
Yahne, 
Vice-Chairperson 
Michael 
Gluszewski, Treasurer Sharon Morales, Sec-
retary Greg Lee and other current members of 
the Board of Directors: Tai Adkins, Jodi Allen, 
Leo 
Barron, 
LaToya 
DuBose, 
Sister 
Annemarie Kampwerth, PHJC, Rozanne Mor-
ton, Margaret Tarchala, and Candace Wil-
liams. 
I am also grateful for the sponsorship of 
Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, and for the 
grant partnerships, organizations, friends, and 
community groups who work tirelessly to sup-
port this incredible organization. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my 
other distinguished colleagues join me in hon-
oring and congratulating Sojourner Truth 
House on its 25th anniversary. For the past 25 
years, the staff and leadership have touched 
the lives of countless individuals through their 
unwavering commitment to those in need. The 
ministry is a beacon of hope for so many and 
serves as an inspiration to us all.

IN HONOR OF THE 150TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF SINCLAIR LODGE 
HON. JOE WILSON

Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today I recognize the 150th Anniver-
sary of the Sinclair Lodge No. 154 of Ancient 
Free Masons in West Columbia, South Caro-

rality, and perseverance. 
The Sinclair Lodge exemplifies greatness, 
taking good men and teaching them to be bet-
ter men. The organization also demonstrates 
outstanding generosity through their support of 
various charities. Among these include aca-
demic scholarships to local high schools and 
even the Special Olympics of South Carolina.

HONORING THE 55TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF PROTEUS, INC. 
HON. CONNIE CONWAY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Ms. CONWAY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Proteus, Inc. for its 55 
years of service in California’s San Joaquin 
Valley. 
Proteus was established in 1967 through 
the Tulare County Community Action Agency. 
It began as an adult basic education class for 
low-income residents held in a basement in 
Visalia, California. Within a year, over 2,000 
students were enrolled in its classes, allowing 
Proteus to incorporate in 1972. Expanding 
rapidly, Proteus created numerous employ-
ment and vocational programs while moving 
into Kings, Fresno, Kern, and Los Angeles 
Counties. It opened skilled training centers in 
all 5 counties, which helped farmworkers tran-
sition into vocational careers. 
In the 1980s and 1990s, Proteus adapted its 
services to the diversifying needs of the San 
Joaquin Valley. It provided job training to refu-
gees, high school dropouts, and women out-
side the workforce. Family services were em-
phasized with the building of community cen-
ters. Proteus also led relief efforts for farm-
workers and communities affected by environ-
mental disasters. The agency celebrated the 
onset of the 21st Century with a milestone ac-
complishment: becoming an accredited edu-
cational training institution. 
Today, Proteus continues to address the 
most pressing contemporary challenges. For 
example, responding to the energy crisis, Pro-
teus created energy-saving programs for com-
munities in need while building strong partner-
ships with local utility companies. After 55 
years of operation, Proteus has earned its rep-
utation as a nationally recognized full-service 
agency. In recognition of its outstanding work, 
the agency has won numerous awards includ-
ing from the California Awards for Perform-
ance Excellence program. 
Today, Proteus operates approximately 50 
programs for people of all ages and back-
grounds. Its work includes emergency sup-
portive services, energy conservation, foster 
family services, prevention services, pesticide 
safety training, and career and technical edu-
cation classes. Even with the diversification of 
its services, however, Proteus remains firmly 
rooted in its core mission: ‘‘to provide edu-
cation, workplace training, job placement, and 
other support services to farm working families 
and diverse program participants to empower 
them to achieve self-sufficiency’’. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
United States House of Representatives to 
join me in commending Proteus, Inc. for 55 
years of service in the San Joaquin Valley and 
for many more decades of growth and suc-
cess to come. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROV-
ING ACCESS TO ADVANCE CARE 
PLANNING ACT 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I am pleased to introduce legislation to re-
move barriers to increase access to advance 
care planning in the Medicare program. 
As we look for ways to lower health care 
spending, how we approach end of life care 
must be part of the conversation. When more 
than 90 percent of health care expenditures 
are spent on treating chronic conditions, it’s 
clear that we shouldn’t spend money on un-
wanted care and instead empower patients 
and families to think about these decisions be-
fore it is too late. 
Improving Medicare coverage of voluntary 
discussions with providers about living wills, 
power of attorney, and other end-of-life treat-
ment preferences can allow for these delicate 
and complex conversations to happen in a 
thoughtful manner. 
Since 2009, I have introduced multiple 
pieces of legislation and built bipartisan sup-
port to improve Medicare coverage of these 
services to ensure that patients’ wishes are re-
spected and families are well prepared for this 
emotionally demanding time. In 2015, the 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
(CMS) put forward a proposal, based on my 
Personalize Your Care Act, to allow physicians 
to bill for advance care planning. In the first 
year alone, these codes were used by more 
than 22,000 providers on behalf of more than 
570,000 beneficiaries. 
In the last two and a half years, we’ve seen 
tremendous loss and we must meet this mo-
ment. This legislation does just that by making 
this service free for beneficiaries and letting 
clinical social workers offer the service, allow-
ing more patients to access this benefit. 
I urge support for this legislation.

RECOGNIZING MRS. CHRISTIE 
JORDAN 
HON. ERIC A. ‘‘RICK’’ CRAWFORD 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Christie Jordan for her 
25 years of dedicated service to the Food 
Bank of Northeast Arkansas as Chief Execu-
tive Officer. 
Since becoming CEO in 1997, Mrs. Jordan 
has overseen the rapid growth of the Food 
Bank of Northeast Arkansas which today dis-
tributes millions of pounds of food to over 100 
partnering organizations including food pan-
tries, soup kitchens, and shelters across 12 
counties serving thousands of people. In her 
role, Mrs. Jordan works with state and federal 
agencies, the Food Bank’s partner organiza-
tions, local businesses, and oversees grant 
writing and fundraising to secure the re-
sources the Food Bank needs each year. Ad-
ditionally, through her leadership, the Food 
Bank continued operating and serving the 
community during the challenges of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Her biggest achievement as CEO came in 
2012 when she moved the Food Bank from a 
13,000-square-foot facility to a custom-de-
signed 56,000-square-foot facility. This facility 
upgrade became possible after she led a fund-
raising effort to raise $1.6 million in matching 
funds to receive a grant from the Donald W. 
Reynolds Foundation. 
For her work at the Food Bank, she re-
ceived the 2010 Public Citizen of the Year 
from the Arkansas chapter of the National As-
sociation of Social Workers and the 2011 Non-
profit Executive of the Year in the inaugural 
Northeast Arkansas Business of the Year 
awards. 
Throughout her career, Mrs. Jordan has 
given back to her community in other ways, in-
cluding serving as a Founding Member in 
2004 and currently as a Board Member for the 
Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, serving as 
the Jonesboro Regional Chamber of Com-
merce Governmental Affairs Committee Chair-
man, and serving as the Community Director 
for the March of Dimes from 1996 to 1997. 
The City of Jonesboro and the entire North-
east Arkansas region are blessed to have Mrs. 
Jordan in our community, which includes the 
thousands of families who have been directly 
touched by her work. In her own words in an 
August 2021 interview, Mrs. Jordan said, ‘‘I 
feel passionate about people investing their 
time and talents into the community to make 
it a better place.’’ Over her decades-long ca-
reer of investing her time and talents, Mrs. 
Jordan has certainly made Northeast Arkan-
sas a better place. 
With heartfelt thanks, I congratulate Mrs. 
Jordan on 25 years as the CEO of the Food 
Bank of Northeast Arkansas and look forward 
to seeing her impact on our community for the 
years and decades to come.

HONORING THE CAREER OF SER-
GEANT 
FIRST 
CLASS 
TREVOR 
BRITTELL 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished military ca-
reer of Sergeant First Class Trevor Brittell in 
the Connecticut Army National Guard which 
recently ended after 25 years of valorous serv-
ice. Sergeant Brittell officially discharged on 
September 8, 2021, which is being publicly 
celebrated post-COVID on its one-year anni-
versary this month. Throughout his years of 
distinguished service, Trevor has been a shin-
ing pillar of duty, compassion, and profes-
sionalism. His retirement has been well-de-
served. 
Trevor’s Connecticut roots have taken hold 
since a young age, when he and his family 
moved to Simsbury, Connecticut from their 
home state of California at age six. Upon his 
graduation from Simsbury High School, Trevor 
followed in the steps of his late grandfather 
and voluntarily enlisted in the Army National 
Guard in 1997, where he was assigned to the 
102nd Infantry. During this time, Trevor en-
rolled at Western Connecticut State University 
where he studied Justice and Law Administra-
tion, a curriculum he later applied to his work 
at the guard and local law enforcement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E942 
September 15, 2022 
Madam Speaker, Trevor’s enlistment in the 
Army National Guard altered his life’s trajec-
tory forever, particularly with the 9–11 terrorist 
attack on U.S. soil. As every guard member 
and reservist knows, the demands on the re-
serve forces changed dramatically in the wake 
of 9–11. Every mission overseas by the U.S. 
military, whether in the Middle East or other 
hot spots required the robust and highly skilled 
men and women of our Nation’s reserve 
forces. Sergeant Brittell’s deployments after 9– 
11 are a perfect example of that pattern. A 
week after 9–11, he was deployed as an in-
fantryman to Bosnia under Operation Joint 
Forge. Upon his return to the States, he was 
stationed at West Point under Operation Noble 
Eagle, supporting security efforts on U.S. mili-
tary installations which were dramatically hard-
ened after 9–11, requiring more personnel. 
That assignment rekindled a strong interest in 
a career as a Military Policeman. He also 
made another positive life decision during this 
point in his life, meeting and marrying his wife, 
Kateri. 
Like all military families, the call to duty re-
sulted in inevitable separations, which he and 
his wife steadfastly endured. In 2006, with the 
rank of Corporal, he successfully completed 
an 18-month deployment to Afghanistan under 
Operation Enduring Freedom. Upon return he 
made the decision to commit his skill and 
training to military policing. Almost immediately 
upon his graduation as a Military Policeman, 
then-promoted Sergeant Brittell was deployed 
in 2009 on a second, 12-month tour in the 
Middle East under Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
Upon his return to Connecticut, Trevor was 
promoted to Staff Sergeant and transferred to 
the Regional Training Center in Camp Niantic, 
passing on the most impactful lessons and 
training which he had experienced over the 
years to new trainees. In 2014, he transferred 
closer to home with an eye set on continued 
operational leadership, serving as squad lead-
er of the 143rd Military Police Company in 
West Hartford, Connecticut. Though Brittell 
transferred again and was promoted to Ser-
geant First Class in the interim, he ultimately 
returned to the 143rd, serving with the Com-
pany through to retirement, even being de-
ployed once more to support safety proce-
dures during the 2021 presidential inaugura-
tion and further operating as Team Com-
mander of the 143rd Military Police team for 
the 2021 SWAT Challenge. 
Despite Trevor’s demanding schedule within 
the Connecticut National Guard, he found time 
to serve through many additional roles, includ-
ing his most important as a father to his two 
children, Cara and Jack. In 2014, Trevor also 
began a second career with the Simsbury Po-
lice Department, purposing his valuable skills 
as a Military Policeman toward the safety of 
his hometown. During 2013 and 2014, Trevor 
also served in the Honor Guard for the Hart-
ford Judicial Marshalls and is currently in the 
Honor Guard for the Simsbury Police Depart-
ment. He is also, of note, the School Re-
source Officer for Simsbury High School. In 
that challenging job, he is entrusted with the 
safety and health of our state’s most precious 
treasure, our children. With his commitment to 
creating bonds of trust in law enforcement with 
young people, Trevor volunteered to act as 
the director of the Simsbury Police Cadets. 
Madam Speaker, it is hard to capture the 
entirety of SFC Brittell’s passion for his com-
munity and nation which has been present 
throughout his life and career. He has and 
continues to live a life that is defined by patri-
otism and compassion. Although his career 
with the military has come to a conclusion, we 
will forever appreciate his sharp sense of dedi-
cation, which has undoubtedly been further in-
stilled within the countless trainees under his 
watch. I hope that his example of selfless 
dedication to his fellow citizens is carried on, 
and that he is able to enjoy a fruitful retire-
ment with his family, while still serving the 
town of Simsbury. To that end, I ask my col-
leagues in the House to join me in honoring 
and congratulating Trevor Brittell for his dedi-
cation to our Nation through the Army National 
Guard.

Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to extend my congratulations to a tire-
less advocate in my state who is retiring after 
over four decades of working to improve the 
lives of her fellow Mainers. 
Barbara Crider first came to Maine in 1981 
with a career in public service in mind. She 
spent ten years working for local Community 
Action Agencies in Bangor and Sanford as an 
Intake Specialist and Director of Community 
Services before pursuing a law degree at 
American University. 
In 1994, Barbara returned to Maine perma-
nently to found the Penquis Law Project. Bar-
bara focused her practice on public interest 
family law, primarily providing invaluable rep-
resentation to victims of domestic violence and 
sexual assault. 
After founding a second law practice in Ban-
gor, Barbara returned to the York County 
Community Action Corporation, serving first as 
its Deputy Director and later as its Executive 
Director, helping the organization to grow and 
diversify its program offerings. Most recently 
under her leadership, thousands of Mainers 
were able to get the assistance they needed 
during the height of the COVID–19 pandemic. 
In Maine, we pride ourselves on having a 
‘can do’ attitude and encouraging others to do 
the same. Perhaps that’s why the term dirigo 
or ‘I lead’ was selected for our State seal in 
1820. Barbara has spent her life embodying 
the dirigo spirit and I am proud to extend my 
sincere congratulations to her as she begins 
her next chapter.

RECOGNIZING LUIS QUINTANA 
HON. ALBIO SIRES 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize my good friend Luis Quintana, the 
Councilman at Large in the City of Newark, 
New Jersey. Councilman Quintana is being 
honored as the Grand Marshall of this year’s 
Puerto Rican Day Parade on September 18, 
2022. Luis is a dedicated public servant and 
inspiring role model for the Puerto Rican com-
munity and the people of Newark who has 
served on the City Council for 28 years. Born 
in An˜asco, Puerto Rico, Luis moved to New-
ark, NJ when he was seven years old. He 
faced challenges as he found himself in a new 
city where his classmates spoke a different 
language, but he overcame them and went on 
to graduate from Barringer High School before 
attending Seton Hall University. Luis became 
an advocate for Newark’s youth, believing that 
all students deserved access to the same 
quality education regardless of background. At 
the same time, he was actively involved in the 
community, becoming a member of the Demo-
cratic County Committee in 1981 before serv-
ing as Deputy Mayor from 1986 to 1994. In 
2013, Luis broke boundaries when he became 
the first Hispanic Mayor of Newark, NJ. I could 
continue to list his many accomplishments, but 
I think the most important one is a goal he set 
himself during his time as Mayor. Luis said in 
an interview that his ‘‘only mission is to make 
Newark a better place’’ and he has undoubt-
edly done just that. His work has benefitted 
the many New Jerseyans who call Newark 
home, and he is a role model for the Puerto 
Rican community. I am proud to call Council-
man Luis Quintana a colleague and friend.

CELEBRATING B. BRAUN MEDICAL 
INC. GRAND OPENING IN DAY-
TONA BEACH, FLORIDA 
HON. MICHAEL WALTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the grand opening of B. Braun Med-
ical Inc.’s new pharmaceutical manufacturing 
plant in Daytona Beach, Florida. 
B. Braun has long been a leader in manu-
facturing medical devices and IV solutions. 
The company has been able to emerge as a 
leader while also maintaining its staunch com-
mitment to protecting patients from exposure 
to harmful chemicals—ensuring their devices 
and products are made with the highest qual-
ity materials. Their new facility in Daytona 
Beach is no different as it will manufacture So-
dium Chloride for Injection in B. Braun’s Excel 
Plus IV Bags, which are free from PVC, 
DEHP, and natural rubber latex. 
As our healthcare providers know, Sodium 
Chloride for injection is a solution used to ad-
minister lifesaving and life-sustaining thera-
pies. These IV solutions are often used for 
adult and pediatric patients as sources of elec-
trolytes and water for hydration—commonly 
used to treat COVID–19 and Flu patients. Not 
only is Sodium Chloride included on the FDA’s 
list of Essential Medicines, but there have also 
been several shortages of Sodium Chloride in 
the last 5 years. 
With an investment of more than 300 million 
dollars, B. Braun’s impressive 218,000 square 
foot facility will play a critical role in alleviating 
IV fluid shortages across the country. We 
learned the hard way during the COVID–19 
pandemic that we can no longer rely on im-
porting medical products from overseas and 
that reliance can be a matter of life and death. 
This new Daytona Beach facility will bring 
healthcare manufacturing back to where it be-
longs—right here in the United States. 
This past August, I had the privilege of at-
tending the ribbon cutting ceremony of B.

Braun’s new facility in Daytona Beach. During 
this ceremony, I was excited to learn about 
the economic and educational impact B. Braun 
will have on our local community. In addition 
to their plans to expand beyond the 500 em-
ployees currently on site, B. Braun has also 
collaborated with local educational institutions, 
including Daytona State College and Embry- 
Riddle Aeronautical University, to establish a 
workforce development initiative to train em-
ployees for high-skilled jobs. 
There is no doubt that B. Braun’s new phar-
maceutical manufacturing site in Daytona 
Beach will provide much needed relief to our 
healthcare industry and bring us one step 
closer to a self-sustaining medical manufac-
turing industry here in the United States. As 
the Representative of Florida’s 6th Congres-
sional District, I am proud to have this B. 
Braun facility in our community and I look for-
ward to the positive impacts it will have on my 
constituents, Floridians, and every American.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
CHARLES LAMAR ADAMS 
HON. BARRY MOORE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise to recognize the life of Charles 
Lamar Adams, who sadly passed away on 
Wednesday, August 10, 2022, at the age of 
96. 
Mr. Adams was a graduate of Graceville 
High School and he later attended Auburn 
University in 1943 for a few weeks before put-
ting his education on hold to bravely enlist in 
the Navy and serve his country in the Second 
World War. 
When he returned from his time in the serv-
ice, Charles met and married Ms. Nelma 
Grace from Hartford, Alabama. Together, they 
were blessed with 3 lovely daughters, 8 beau-
tiful grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren, 
who now carry on the family legacy. 
After resuming his education, Charles went 
on to receive his Associate of Arts degree, a 
Bachelor’s degree, and a Master’s degree. 
Later, Charles continued serving his com-
munity by pursuing a career in education—be-
coming a high school teacher, a high school 
principal, a college professor, and the Super-
intendent of Education in Washington County, 
Florida. 
Charles continued to teach and remained 
active in the education system well into his 
seventies. In total, Charles’ career in edu-
cation spanned 54 years. 
Charles dedicated his life to serving his 
community and his country. He was an Amer-
ican hero that touched many of the lives 
around him as an educator, a son, a brother, 
a husband, a father, a grandfather, and a 
great-grandfather. 
Charles Lamar Adams left a lifelong impres-
sion on every student and member of the 
community that crossed his path. I join his 
many friends, family members, and the entire 
Second Congressional District of Alabama in 
honoring and preserving his legacy of service. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LEE 
DANKER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Lee Walter Danker, a friend 
to many and advocate for animals. He fought 
pancreatic cancer for almost 4 years and 
passed surrounded by his family on Friday, 
July 22, 2022. Lee was an important compo-
nent to the community and always cared for 
those around him. 
Lee Walter Danker was born on November 
18, 1961 in Barcelona, Spain. He graduated 
from Campolindo High School, and then in 
1984, he earned his degree in Communica-
tions from California State University, Fresno. 
After college, Lee worked in television for 
channel 30 and 47. In 1987, he decided that 
Macy’s would be a great transition in career, 
and in 2003, he became a personal shopper. 
During those years, Lee made many friends 
and accumulated customers. During his time 
of working at Macy’s, I met Lee and cherished 
our friendship. After years as a personal shop-
per, he retired in 2021. For a total of 35 years, 
Lee was part of Macy’s and enjoyed every 
part of it. 
Lee loved animals and was a proud sup-
porter of donating your time to help them. He 
was a board member for the HOPE Animal 
Foundation for 16 years and was a fundraising 
volunteer for Valley Animal Center. For 36 
years he spent his time helping that organiza-
tion, and in 2019, Lee received the Animal Ad-
vocate Award from Valley Animal Shelter. On 
top of his volunteer work, he would give to nu-
merous animal organizations whether it was 
local or not whenever an opportunity was pro-
vided to him. 
His time was spent giving back to others, 
and that included for the homeless and chil-
dren. He could be seen handing out water 
and/or goodie bags to the homeless and 
would contribute to the Big Brother/Big Sister 
Annual Coat Drive. He would advocate for 
children during those winters and encouraged 
people to purchase coats for the organization. 
When he was not caring for those in need, 
Lee loved to travel, watch movies and TV, 
spending time in his garden, eating good food, 
and taking cat naps. As long as he was sur-
rounded by people, Lee was his happiest. 
Lee is survived by his father, Willard T. 
Danker of Superior, CO; his sister, Stephanie 
(Kerry) Kirby of Superior, CO; his nieces, Jen-
nifer (Casey) Jaeger of Sheridan, WY and Ni-
cole Kirby of Temple, TX; his great-niece and 
nephew, Madison, and Connor Jaeger; and 
many dear friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Lee Walter Danker. 
His selfless love for animals and people, and 
contributions to the community will forever be 
remembered. 
REMEMBERING DINDAR SINGH 
BAINS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and lasting contribu-
tions of Dindar Singh Bains. Passing away at 
the age of 84, Mr. Bains leaves behind an in-
delible legacy in the farming and business 
community in the Yuba-Sutter area. 
In 1958, Mr. Bains came to the United 
States from India with eight dollars and the 
hope of achieving his American Dream. Farm-
ing became Mr. Bains’ passion when he ar-
rived in Yuba City as he appreciated the 
land’s likeness to Punjab, India. Through his 
tireless efforts as a farmer, Mr. Bains, other-
wise known as the ‘Peach King,’ became the 
largest independent peach grower in the world 
and the second largest cranberry grower for 
Ocean Spray. As a board member of the Cali-
fornia Canning Peach Association, Mr. Bains 
benefitted Californian growers and farmers 
through his tireless efforts and advocacy. 
Mr. Bains was an integral part of the Yuba- 
Sutter community. Through his passion for 
farming, his advocacy for the city, and his in-
strumental efforts as a founding member of 
the Sikh Temple Gurdwara, Mr. Bains left a 
lasting impact on the community. His signifi-
cant legacy will be commemorated with the 
construction of ‘‘Dindar S. Bains Park’’ in Yuba 
City on land Mr. Bains once farmed himself. 
This new public area will serve as a gathering 
place in honor of the community that Mr. 
Bains forged across the Yuba-Sutter area. 
Mr. Bains is survived by his wife, three chil-
dren, several grandchildren and great-grand-
children, and a community that will miss his 
tenacious spirit. I would like to extend my 
deepest sympathies to Mr. Bains’ loved ones. 
I know that they, along with the entire Yuba- 
Sutter community, join me in celebrating his 
life and legacy.

IN MEMORY OF QUEEN ELIZABETH 
II 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, as co-chair of the U.K. Caucus of 
the U.S. Congress, I am grateful to recognize 
Queen Elizabeth II for her dedication and dec-
ades-long era of service to the people of the 
United Kingdom, the Commonwealth, and the 
Realms. 
On September 8, 2022, after 70 years of 
service to the United Kingdom and the Com-
monwealth realms, the beloved Queen Eliza-
beth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, the 
home she cherished. Queen Elizabeth reigned 
with dignity and elegance, leading unparalleled 
human progress, and winning over the hearts 
of many around the world. During her reign, 
she endured as a symbol of stability and 
strength as the monarchy faced constant polit-
ical, cultural, and social change. The spirit of 
her steadfast leadership and devotion to the 
cause of freedom will remain with us all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E944 
September 15, 2022 
During Queen Elizabeth’s seven decades of 
service, she worked with 15 prime ministers, 
from Churchill to Truss, and 14 American 
presidents, from Truman to Biden. She wel-
comed her responsibility to not just represent 
her country with grace and poise, but to also 
play a constitutional role in government deci-
sions, meeting with prime ministers weekly in 
private audiences. She also valued maintain-
ing a connection with her people. This in-
cluded making radio broadcasts, establishing 
a social media presence, introducing the Com-
monwealth games, sponsoring 3,000 charities 
across the globe, and hosting her much 
adored Jubilees. 
The civilized have benefitted incredibly with 
British cultural and government influences. I 
have experienced firsthand from an apprecia-
tion in America, to Ghana, to Hong Kong, to 
the Caribbean islands of St. Vincent, Bar-
bados, British Virgin Islands, to Bermuda, free-
dom and democracy have been enhanced. 
I especially appreciate that I grew up in the 
most British city of North America—Charles-
ton, South Carolina. Founded in 1670, sur-
viving the American Revolution and Civil War, 
until unintended mothballing by poverty for a 
century to be revived in the 1960’s with res-
toration of the elegant homes of the 1700’s. 
Shortly after the Queen’s passing, a double 
rainbow appeared over Buckingham Palace as 
thousands of members of the public gathered 
around to pay their respects. Not long after, a 
rainbow also appeared above Windsor Castle 
and Balmoral. This was a wonderous occur-
rence, as thousands of people, looking up at 
the sky, reflected on the Queen who served 
them so wonderfully for most of their lives. As 
Winston Churchill once stated, ‘‘All the film 
people in the world, if they had scoured the 
globe, could not have found anyone so suited 
to the part.’’ I offer my sincerest condolences 
to friends in the United Kingdom, the Com-
monwealth, and across the world, on the 
passing of Queen Elizabeth II.

HONORING KATHERIN ELAM 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Katherin Elam of Salem, Virginia, 
who over the years has been a consistent 
positive influence in Salem and the Roanoke 
region, on her upcoming retirement from the 
presidency of Junior Achievement of South-
west Virginia. During a 24-year career at the 
organization, Ms. Elam has been a tremen-
dous positive presence for young people in 
the Roanoke Valley. 
Junior Achievement seeks to prepare stu-
dents for their futures by offering lessons in fi-
nancial literacy, work and career readiness, 
and entrepreneurship. Since 1998, Ms. Elam 
led this volunteer organization’s efforts in the 
Roanoke Valley. In cooperation with local 
teachers, Junior Achievement reaches into 
classrooms to offer guidance and support as 
students set goals and plan to attain them. 
Ms. Elam has grown and maintained a volun-
teer corps and networks that connect students 
to the knowledge and skills they need to 
thrive. 
Over Ms. Elam’s time as president of Junior 
Achievement of Southwest Virginia, it worked 
with 220,000 local students. That number is 
incredible, but for the students who have 
made progress toward their dreams over the 
course of her long and fruitful career, Ms. 
Elam’s true impact is beyond measure. I wish 
her all the best as she concludes her service 
at Junior Achievement of Southwest Virginia 
and pursues her own goals in the future.

FAREWELL TO MAJOR EDWARD C. 
GARCIA, JR. 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a superb Soldier and 
Army legislative liaison for his tireless commit-
ment to the United States Army, serving our 
Nation for 22 years, concluding in the Army 
Legislative Liaison Office. As Major Edward C. 
Garcia, Jr. retires from the United States 
Army, I believe it is fitting to recognize his 
service and dedication to fostering the rela-
tionship between the United States Army and 
this Chamber. 
Major Garcia’s commitment to service en-
abled him to excel in numerous leadership po-
sitions throughout his Army career. Major Gar-
cia began his career by enlisting in the U.S. 
Army Reserves in 1999. He transitioned to ac-
tive duty in 2001 and completed Officer Can-
didate School in 2008, commissioning into the 
Signal Corp, where he would serve for the re-
mainder of his career. Throughout his career 
he distinguished himself as a tactical and 
technical expert, serving in the most demand-
ing conventional and special operations units 
in the Army, to include serving as the commu-
nications officer-in-charge for the Commanding 
General of United States Central Command. 
Major Garcia’s relentless commitment to the 
Army proved invaluable in providing support to 
the House of Representatives and our con-
stituents. He spent countless hours ensuring 
our Members were educated on Army combat 
systems, modernization programs and policy 
initiatives. He also managed and led multiple 
Congressional Delegations to various locations 
around the globe. Major Garcia has become a 
trusted adviser and friend to many of us, dis-
tinguishing himself by continuously going 
above and beyond the call of duty to serve the 
needs of Congress. 
Major Garcia had a profound impact on this 
Chamber while supporting the House of Rep-
resentatives. I join many past and present 
Members of Congress in my gratitude and ap-
preciation to Major Garcia for his outstanding 
leadership and unwavering support. This na-
tion is grateful for his commitment and the 
personal sacrifices he has made during his 
time in the Army Legislative Liaison Office and 
United States Army. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives and the United States of 
America, I commend Major Garcia for his tire-
less dedication in support of our Army, our 
Soldiers and this Nation. I congratulate him on 
an extremely successful career, dedicated to 
service, and wish him the best in all his future 
endeavors.

IN RECOGNITION OF SENATOR C.B. 
EMBRY, JR. 
HON. BRETT GUTHRIE 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the retirement of Senator C.B. 
Embry, Jr. from the Kentucky General Assem-
bly after over 50 years of service to the Com-
monwealth of Kentucky. 
From the youngest elected Mayor of Beaver 
Dam in 1970 to the oldest member of the Ken-
tucky State Senate in 2022, Senator Embry 
has earned the trust of his constituents to hold 
numerous offices, including Kentucky State 
Representative for District 17 and Ohio County 
Judge-Executive. A testament to his skills as 
a legislator, Senator Embry has the distinction 
of five Kentucky Governors signing his spon-
sored legislation into law. This includes a bill 
he proudly championed to give hope to termi-
nally ill patients, who had exhausted all other 
options, by allowing them to try experimental 
forms of medication with at least one round of 
clinical studies. 
Being renowned for his tireless work, Sen-
ator Embry was recognized with several acco-
lades, including AARP Kentucky’s ‘‘Champion 
of the 50+’’ lifetime legislative leadership 
award, the National Guard Association of the 
United States’ Patrick Henry Award, and the 
Kentucky Education Association’s Friend of 
Education Award. Earlier in his career, he was 
awarded the Outstanding Young Republican in 
the Nation award by George H.W. Bush in 
1975. 
C.B. Embry and his wife Wanda celebrated 
60 years of marriage this year and together 
they have 3 children, 4 grandchildren, and 2 
great-grandchildren. Congratulations to Sen-
ator Embry on his retirement and I thank him 
for his decades of service to the Common-
wealth of Kentucky.

IN MEMORIAM, VINCENT UNGRO 
HON. MATT GAETZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, September 15, 2022 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize the life and accomplishments of Vin-
cent Ungro. With his passing on September 5, 
2022, America lost a true patriot. Vincent, also 
known as Vinny to friends and family, was a 
proud American from Staten Island. He had a 
heart of gold and a head for politics. 
Vinny was never afraid to voice his opinions 
and beliefs, regardless of what others might 
think. He ran the popular ‘Conservative Dad’ 
Facebook page, where he advocated for con-
servatism and capitalism.

Family and friends will remember Vinny for 
fighting for what he believed in. His passion 
for politics is only matched by his love for the 
New York Islanders and Metallica. 
In addition to being a 2020 National Pulse 
Writing Fellow, Vinny was a member and sup-
porter of the New York Young Republican 
Club. 
He also cared deeply for animals and loved 
working for the American Society for the Pre-
vention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA). 
As much as Vinny loved politics, family 
mattered most to him. He cherished his par-
ents, Stephen and Jean; his wife, Judith; his 
children, Steve, Nicholas, Gabriella, and Mia; 
and grandkids, Madison, Gabriella, Natalie, 
and Oliver. 
Vinny was an extraordinary individual, and 
he will be missed by all. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the United 
States Congress, I recognize the remarkable 
life lived by Vincent Ungro today. I thank him 
for all he did for his community and country.
