NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
let me begin this afternoon with the 
following quote: 
[F]ew men in . . . society . . . will have 
sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them 
for the stations of judges. And . . . the num-
ber must still be still smaller of those who 
unite the requisite integrity with the req-
uisite knowledge. 
That was Alexander Hamilton in Fed-
eralist 78. 
The Framers knew the independent 
judiciary would be a crucial part of 
this new experiment in self-govern-
ment. If the separation of powers were 
to endure and the people’s rights were 
to be safe, we would need individuals of 
the highest quality on the courts. So 
how fortunate for our country that the 
Senate just advanced one of the most 
qualified nominees to judicial service 
that we have seen in our lifetimes. 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett of the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Cir-
cuit is a stellar nominee in every single 
respect. Her intellectual brilliance is 
unquestioned. Her command of the law 
is remarkable. Her integrity is above 
reproach. 
First, as an award-winning academic 
and then as a circuit judge, she has 
worked her way up to the pinnacle of 
the law. 
But just as importantly, Judge Bar-
rett has displayed zero willingness to 
impose personal views or clumsily 
craft new policy with her gavel. She 
has demonstrated the judicial humil-
ity, the neutrality, and the commit-
ment to our written Constitution that 
are essential for this office. 
By now, as tends to happen by the 
end of these processes, the Senate 
knows Judge Barrett very well. Sen-
ators saw the Judiciary Committee put 
the nominee through her paces with 
days of exhaustive questioning. We 
have been able to study nearly 100 
opinions she has issued in 3 years on 
the Federal bench. We have had an-
other opportunity to examine the 15 
years of scholarly writings that most 
of us reviewed 3 years ago when Judge 
Barrett won bipartisan confirmation to 
her current job. And we have been del-
uged by personal testimonies from 
every corner of Judge Barrett’s career 
and life to confirm just what a remark-
able person this nominee is. 
One of Judge Barrett’s former col-
leagues at Notre Dame is a leading ex-
pert in comparative constitutional law. 
That means he studies the courts and 
constitutions of countries all around 
the world. He meets judges from across 
the planet. 
Here is what this expert says about 
his colleague: ‘‘I have had very many 
occasions to meet, observe, and work 
with high court judges from all over 
the world, from Argentina to Austria, 
from South Africa to South Korea . . . 
[and] I can say with great certainty 
that Judge Barrett stands out, on a par 
in her abilities with the most distin-
guished’’ of them all. He goes on to say 
her legal work is ‘‘as erudite as it [is] 
clear and accessible,’’ and ‘‘as honest 
and fair-minded . . . as anyone could 
aspire to, with not a hint of personal 
bias.’’ 
Now, most of us would be thrilled to 
receive such praise once or twice in an 
entire career—in an entire career—but 
Judge Barrett seems to provoke this 
reaction in absolutely everyone. The 
highest professional compliments seem 
to be the default reaction of anybody 
who crosses her path, anybody who 
comes into contact with her. 
Eighty-one of her law school class-
mates from ‘‘diverse backgrounds, po-
litical affiliations, and philosophies’’ 
say the nominee embodies ‘‘the highest 
caliber of intellect . . . fair-minded-
ness, empathy, integrity, humility, 
good humor, and commitment to jus-
tice.’’ They also said: ‘‘As fellow stu-
dents, we often learned more from Amy 
than the professor.’’ 
Three years ago, more than 70 fellow 
scholars wrote the Senate, calling her 
scholarship ‘‘careful,’’ ‘‘rigorous [and] 
fair-minded.’’ They said her ‘‘personal 
integrity’’ earns wide respect. 
Listen to this. Every one of the Su-
preme 
Court 
alumni 
who 
clerked 
alongside Judge Barrett wrote us to 
share their ‘‘unanimous’’ view that she 
is a ‘‘woman of remarkable intellect 
and 
character.’’ 
That 
means, 
col-
leagues, those were the clerks to Gins-
burg and the clerks to Breyer as well— 
all of them, without exception. 
How did that clerkship come about? 
It came about, by the way, after one of 
her professors, who is now a university 
president, wrote Justice Scalia with 
one sentence: ‘‘Amy Coney Barrett is 
the best student I ever had.’’ 
But before she clerked for the Su-
preme Court, she clerked for Laurence 
Silberman over on the DC Circuit, who, 
by his own admission, is an Ivy League 
snob. He got a call one day from a pro-
fessor at Notre Dame, and he said: ‘‘I 
know you only take clerks from mostly 
Harvard and Yale, but this is the best 
student I ever had at Notre Dame.’’ So 
this Ivy League snob decided to take a 
chance on somebody who didn’t go to 
Harvard or Yale. That was Amy Coney 
Barrett. And then he called his good 
friend Nino Scalia and said: ‘‘Goodness, 
gracious, you don’t want to miss this 
opportunity to have this clerk.’’ 
So we have here a uniquely qualified 
person, and the best evidence of it is 
you don’t hear anything over there 
about her qualifications; not a peep 
about her talent, her intellect. We 
have, colleagues, the perfect nominee 
for the Supreme Court. 
A few weeks ago, Harvard Law Pro-
fessor Noah Feldman, who leans left, 
wrote that Judge Barrett is ‘‘a bril-
liant and conscientious lawyer who 
will analyze and decide cases in good 
faith.’’ He said she ‘‘meets and ex-
ceeds’’ the ‘‘basic criteria for being a 
good Justice.’’ 
So, as I was saying, no matter all the 
acrimony that has swirled around the 
process, nobody has attempted to dis-
pute Judge Barrett’s qualifications. To 
the contrary, no one can help being im-
pressed. 
At one point during Judge Barrett’s 
hearing, she was asked about an arcane 
legal doctrine. Her answer was so clear 
and so accessible that one of our Demo-
cratic colleagues—I won’t name him; I 
don’t want to get him in trouble—had 
to remark: ‘‘That’s quite a definition. 
I’m really impressed.’’ Well, so are the 
American people. 
Some opponents of this nomination 
come right out and say ‘‘It is not about 
qualifications.’’ They deserve some 
credit for being honest about it. They 
say they aren’t interested in whether 
Judge Barrett will smartly and faith-
fully apply our laws and our Constitu-
tion. They aren’t interested in that. In-
stead, they want to make apocalyptic 
predictions about policy. 
Well, there are a few problems with 
that. One is that their political side

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6451 
October 25, 2020 
has been shopping the same horror sto-
ries for 50 years. They have been saying 
the same thing for half a century about 
every Supreme Court nominee by a Re-
publican President, without exception. 
Many of those judges—not to the de-
light of some people on this side of the 
aisle—went on to not disappoint the 
other side, which shows you how hard 
it is to predict what someone will be 
for life. Many have been surprised, 
some unpleasantly. 
It is almost as if jurists are not poli-
ticians with policy platforms. It is al-
most as though that is the wrong way 
to look at it. That is a deeper mis-
understanding of what is at play here. 
Let me quote an expert: ‘‘A judge 
must apply the law as written, not as 
she wishes it were.’’ 
Scalia used to put it this way. He 
would say: If you want to make policy, 
why don’t you run for office? That is 
not what we do here. That is not our 
job. 
It takes a good deal of discipline to 
squeeze your personal opinion out of 
your decision-making. Those are the 
kinds of judges we have been con-
firming here for the last 4 years—peo-
ple who are sworn to uphold the law 
and take it seriously. 
President Obama once said he wanted 
to appoint judges who had empathy. 
Think about it for a minute. If you are 
the litigant for whom the judge has 
empathy, you are probably in pretty 
good shape. But what if you aren’t? 
That is not what we have been doing 
here for the last 4 years with the judi-
ciary. The reason that frightens these 
guys on the other side so much is be-
cause that is exactly what they want— 
another branch of legislators seeking 
outcomes that may or may not be re-
flected in the law or the Constitution 
that is before them. That is exactly 
what they want. 
Courts have a vital responsibility to 
enforce the rule of law, which is crit-
ical to a free society, but the policy de-
cisions and value judgments of the gov-
ernment must be made by the political 
branches elected by and accountable to 
the people. The public should not ex-
pect courts to do so, and courts should 
not try—shouldn’t try. 
Now, who said that? That was Amy 
Barrett who said that. She understands 
the separation of powers far more 
keenly than her critics. She under-
stands the job of a judge. 
Our Democratic colleagues should 
not have tried to filibuster this excep-
tional nominee. They should have lis-
tened and actually learned. 
I loved during the hearing when Sen-
ator CORNYN said: What do you have on 
your notepad? She held it up. Nothing. 
Nothing. No notes at all. 
We have a few former Supreme Court 
clerks on that committee: Senator 
CRUZ, Senator HAWLEY. I have heard 
them say over and over—oh, three. 
Mike. Sorry. Three. So they have been 
around the best, at the highest level. 
Nobody has seen anything better than 
this. This is something to really be 
proud of and feel good about. We made 
an important contribution to the fu-
ture of this country. 
A lot of what we have done over the 
last 4 years will be undone sooner or 
later by the next election. They won’t 
be able to do much about this for a 
long time to come. 
Fortunately for Judge Barrett and 
for our Nation, history will remember 
what is already clear: The deficiency is 
with their judgment, not hers—their 
judgment, not hers. The Senate is 
doing the right thing. 
We are moving this nomination for-
ward, and, colleagues, by tomorrow 
night we will have a new member of 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
want to start today by talking about 
some breaking news that may, at first 
glance, not seem relevant to today’s 
proceedings but, in fact, is a perfect il-
lustration of how broken this process 
is. 
We find ourselves in the middle of a 
pandemic that the Republican Party 
has never taken seriously enough, and 
it is a pandemic that is worsening by 
the day. 
According to Dr. Fauci, the nomina-
tion ceremony for Judge Barrett was a 
superspreader event. 
Today, the White House Chief of 
Staff conceded the White House is ‘‘not 
going to control the pandemic.’’ Yet 
last night we learned that several aides 
close to Vice President PENCE
have 
tested recently positive for COVID. 
We wish them and their families well. 
We wish the Vice President and his 
family continued health. But a normal 
response after being close to several 
people with COVID–19 would be to fol-
low CDC guidelines and quarantine for 
everyone’s safety, but this is not the 
case. In the same breath with which 
they announced that Vice President 
PENCE was exposed, the White House 
said that he would keep on cam-
paigning, comparing campaigning work 
to the work that doctors, nurses, fire-
fighters, and police officers do. It is a 
puzzling claim, especially since the 
Vice President failed at the most im-
portant official duty in his portfolio— 
the White House Coronavirus Task 
Force. Not only has the White House 
Coronavirus Task Force failed to keep 
the American people safe; it has even 
failed to keep the White House safe. 
Even worse, the Vice President re-
portedly intends to come to this Cham-
ber tomorrow to preside over Judge 
Barrett’s confirmation vote. The Vice 
President, who has been exposed to five 
people with COVID–19, will ignore CDC 
guidelines to be here tomorrow, put-
ting the health of everyone who works 
in this building at risk. It sets a ter-
rible, terrible example for the Amer-
ican people, and nothing could be a 
more apt metaphor for what is going 
on here. 
The Republican Party is willing to 
ignore the pandemic to rush this Su-
preme Court nomination forward, and 
the Vice President, after being poten-
tially exposed to COVID, will preside. 
The Senate Republicans are willing 
to ignore the need for economic relief. 
They are willing to ignore the Nation’s 
testing needs. They are willing to ig-
nore election interference—all so they 
can put someone on the highest Court 
who could take healthcare away from 
millions of Americans in the middle of 
a pandemic. God save us. 
Now, only a few hours after Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, 
Leader MCCONNELL announced that the 
Republican 
majority 
would 
move 
quickly to confirm her replacement. At 
the time, we didn’t know exactly when, 
but now we do. Republicans are rushing 
to hold a confirmation vote tomorrow 
night, 8 days—8 days—before the elec-
tion, after more than 50 million Ameri-
cans have voted for a President—quite 
possibly, a different President—to pick 
Justices on their behalf; after more 
than 50 million Americans have voted 
for Senators—quite possibly, different 
Senators than some who are here 
today—to advise and consent. 
Confirming a lifetime appointment 
this late into a Presidential election 
season is outrageous. It is even more 
galling, of course, because nearly every 
Republican in this Chamber, led by the 
majority leader 4 years ago, refused to 
even consider the Supreme Court nomi-
nation of a Democratic President on 
the grounds of the principle—the prin-
ciple—that we should wait until after 
the Presidential election because the 
American people deserved a voice in 
the selection of their next Justice. 
My colleagues, there is no escaping 
this glaring hypocrisy. As I said before, 
no tit for tat, convoluted, distorted 
version of history will wipe away the 
stain that will exist forever with this 
Republican majority and with this Re-
publican leader. No escaping the hypoc-
risy, but, oh my, how the Republican 
leader has almost desperately tried. 
Over the past few days and weeks, 
the majority leader has subjected the 
Senate to a long and tortured defense 
of this cynical power grab. The Repub-
lican leader claims the majority’s posi-
tion all along has been that it is ac-
ceptable to deny Justices in Presi-
dential election years when there is di-
vided government. 
But here is what Leader MCCONNELL 
said after Justice Scalia died: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new President. 
He didn’t say: The American people 
should have a voice, but only when 
there’s a divided government. 
He didn’t say: The American people 
deserve a voice, but only when it serves 
the political interests of one party, 
otherwise, we don’t mean it. 
No, Republicans all swore this was a 
‘‘principle’’—their word—not a mere 
incident of who controls the Senate

October 25, 2020 
and the Presidency. And the trans-
parency of this new excuse does not 
cover up the hypocrisy. It does not 
change it one bit, and everyone knows 
it—everyone. 
And, by the way, if this were about 
divided government, the senior Senator 
from Florida would not have said he 
would ‘‘say the same thing if a Repub-
lican President were in office.’’ 
The junior Senator from Iowa would 
not have said: 
Precedent set, precedent set. I’m sure come 
2020, you’ll remind me of that. 
Chairman GRAHAM would not have 
said: 
Hold the tape! Use my words against me! 
You can say LINDSEY GRAHAM said the next 
president, whoever it might be— 
Whoever it might be, not whatever 
party it is in— 
should make the nomination. 
So the flimsiness, the transparency, 
the dishonesty of the excuse that they 
have come up with ex post facto 
doesn’t work. It doesn’t work. 
No, this has never been about the ori-
entation of the Senate and the Presi-
dency. 
Republicans 
promised 
they 
would follow their own standard if the 
situation were reversed—guess not. 
Now, the Republican leader claims 
that the majority’s actions today are 
rooted in some convoluted precedent. 
The truth is, the precedent is clear and 
similar. The Senate has never—never— 
confirmed a Supreme Court Justice so 
close to a Presidential election. The 
Senate has never even confirmed a Jus-
tice between July and election day in a 
Presidential year. I asked the Pre-
siding Officer to confirm these two 
facts, and both were confirmed by the 
records of the Senate. There is no 
precedent—none—for what is going on 
here. 
The Republican leader has claimed 
that the majority’s actions are justi-
fied by all sorts of bad things Demo-
crats did in the past and may hypo-
thetically do in the future. He said 
that every escalation of significance in 
judicial debates was made by Demo-
crats. Convenient, I guess. I guess ‘‘sig-
nificance’’ is in the eye of the beholder, 
because the Republican leader’s history 
conveniently, 
and 
mandatorily 
to 
make his case—his false case—left out 
a whole lot of chapters—ignored. 
He conveniently omitted that Repub-
licans bottled up more than 60 judicial 
nominees from President Clinton, re-
fusing to give them a hearing in the 
1990s. He made no reference to the deci-
sion by Republican Senators to hold 
open 14 appellate court seats under 
President Clinton so that a Republican 
President could fill them instead—a 
tactic Republicans would revisit under 
President Obama, when Republicans 
used partisan filibusters to block his 
nominees to the DC Circuit. 
At the time, the Republican leader 
and Senators from Iowa and Utah said 
that President Obama was—get this— 
trying to ‘‘pack the court.’’ Amazing. 
Pack the court? They held up the nom-
ination so President Obama couldn’t 
have his rightful appointees to the sec-
ond highest court in the land. And they 
kept a number of seats—I believe it 
was four—vacant for such a long time. 
Well, we have heard all of this before. 
It seems whenever the Republicans 
need to scare up some votes, they ac-
cuse Democrats of trying to pack the 
courts, even when it is a Democratic 
President invoking his constitutional 
authority to appoint judges and the 
Republicans are blocking it. 
Republicans tried to nullify Presi-
dent Obama’s authority to nominate 
judges to the circuit court, and then, 
as soon as Republicans had a majority, 
they succeeded in nullifying his prerog-
ative to have a Supreme Court nomina-
tion considered by the Senate. And 
what did Leader MCCONNELL say about 
it? This remark will go down in in-
famy. He called it ‘‘one of his proudest 
moments.’’ 
Apparently, the blame game that 
Leader MCCONNELL wants us to play 
goes all the way back to 1987. That is 
the reason we are so hypocritical— 
what happened back in 1987, says the 
Republican leader. It all began with 
Robert Bork, he says, after Senator 
KENNEDY gave a 3-minute speech that 
Republicans considered intemperate. 
Seriously, that is, according to our Re-
publican friends, the original sin, ac-
cording 
to 
the 
leader—a 
3-minute 
speech. 
While we are on the subject of Robert 
Bork, I would remind my colleagues 
that Robert Bork received a hearing 
and a vote in the Democratic Senate. 
His nomination was defeated by a bi-
partisan majority of Republicans and 
Democrats. Republicans helped defeat 
Bork—left out conveniently by the 
leader’s recantation of history. His 
nomination was defeated and President 
Reagan’s eventual replacement, An-
thony Kennedy, was confirmed unani-
mously. 
For those keeping score, Merrick 
Garland never even got a hearing. 
But because one Democrat gave a 
speech Republicans didn’t like, the 
fight was on, according to the Repub-
lican leader. According to the Repub-
lican leader, because of that 3-minute 
speech in 1987, Republicans can steam-
roll the minority to confirm a Supreme 
Court Justice in the middle of an elec-
tion. 
Imagine trying to explain to some-
one: Sorry, I have to burn down your 
house because of something one of your 
friends said about one of my friends 33 
years ago. Yes, burn down the house 
because of a comment 33 years ago— 
that is what they are doing. 
The leader’s speech—the Republican 
leader’s speech—was schoolyard stuff. 
Here in the U.S. Senate, in order to 
justify an outrageous power grab that 
even some Members of his party don’t 
agree with, the leader’s argument boils 
down to ‘‘But you started it.’’ Any par-
ent with young children would recog-
nize that argument. It is when you 
know you have done something wrong 
but you don’t want the blame. That is 
exactly what the leader’s speech sound-
ed like to so many Americans. 
Let’s get serious here. This isn’t 
about the long history of judicial esca-
lation or a 33-year-old speech. This is 
about raw political power. This is 
about a Senate majority deciding to 
break faith with the American people 
and make a mockery—a mockery—of 
its own principle to secure a seat on 
the Supreme Court. 
Let me dispense with one more fic-
tion. The leader keeps claiming that 
Supreme Court seats have nothing to 
do with power or ideology. Judges and 
justices only apply the law, they claim. 
They only call balls and strikes. My 
Republican friends have told us over 
and over again that if someone is quali-
fied—has 
good, 
topnotch 
qualifica-
tions—they should be confirmed be-
cause judges merely apply the law. 
Well, if that were true, if Leader 
MCCONNELL
truly believed the only 
thing that matters about a judicial 
candidate is his qualifications, then 
Merrick Garland would be sitting on 
the Court right now. His qualifications 
were every bit as good as Amy Coney 
Barrett’s—every bit as good. 
So, all of a sudden, we should only 
judge by qualifications. I get it. I get 
it. If it were true—once again, I will re-
peat it. If any of my Republican friends 
believe that the only thing that mat-
ters is the qualifications of a judicial 
candidate, Merrick Garland would be 
Justice Merrick Garland now. 
No one—and I mean no one—said that 
Judge Garland wasn’t qualified. But 
Republicans subjected his nomination 
to an unprecedented partisan blockade. 
If qualifications are the only thing 
that matter, why did President Trump 
vow to pick only Justices who would 
terminate our healthcare law? Why did 
he say that his judicial appointments 
would 
‘‘do 
the 
right 
thing’’ 
on 
healthcare, ‘‘unlike Justice Roberts’’? 
Why did President Trump say that if 
he gets to appoint two or three Jus-
tices to the Supreme Court, Roe v. 
Wade would be overturned automati-
cally? That is not qualifications. 
President Trump doesn’t have a prob-
lem talking about how judicial ap-
pointments might rule when he is try-
ing to win an election, but, apparently, 
Democrats are, in the words of the 
leader, ‘‘hysterical’’ for even ques-
tioning how Judge Barrett looks at 
hugely consequential issues. 
I want the American people to know: 
The far right is lining up, right now, to 
get the Supreme Court to review your 
fundamental rights because they think 
Judge Barrett might provide a certain 
outcome. President Trump and Repub-
lican attorneys general are suing to 
eliminate the Affordable Care Act in a 
case that will be heard one week after 
the election. 
Three days ago, the President of the 
United States said on tape: ‘‘I hope 
that they will end it. It’ll be so good if 
they’’ did.

current Supreme Court that prevented 
an early cutoff to counting ballots. 
Just one vote on the Court could 
change the outcome. 
The attorney general of Mississippi, 
this week, filed a brief asking the Su-
preme Court to review a Mississippi 
law banning abortions after 15 weeks— 
an invitation for a new configuration 
on the Court to revisit Roe v. Wade. 
So don’t tell me the issues don’t mat-
ter, only qualifications. We are talking 
about the lives and freedoms of the 
American people: the right to afford-
able healthcare, to make their own pri-
vate medical decisions, to join a union, 
to vote without impediments, to marry 
whom they love. And Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett will play a part in decid-
ing whether those rights will be sus-
tained or curtailed for the next genera-
tion of Americans. 
I want to be very clear with the 
American people about what is going 
on here. The Republican Senate major-
ity, America, is breaking faith with 
you—doing the exact opposite of what 
it promised just 4 years ago—to cement 
a majority on the Supreme Court that 
threatens your fundamental rights. 
Don’t forget it, America. Don’t forget 
what is happening here because it is a 
travesty—a travesty. It is a travesty 
for the Senate, a travesty for the coun-
try, and it will be an unerasable stain 
on this Republican majority forever 
more. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
Democratic leader seems to think that 
this had something to do with a 3- 
minute speech 30 years ago. I don’t 
know where that comes from. 
I can tell you that he has been in-
volved in a systematic reversal of the 
longstanding precedent when it comes 
to the consideration of judges to the 
Federal bench by the U.S. Senate. I am 
a beneficiary, I suppose you could say, 
in some strange way of that. That was 
a major issue in my campaign in 2004. 
We made it about the blockade that 
the Democrats in the Senate at the 
time, led by the current Democratic 
leader, had started against a whole 
long list of nominees put forward by 
then-President George W. Bush. 
I remind you of a few names: Janice 
Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen, Miguel 
Estrada, 
Judge 
Charles 
Pickering. 
There was a long list of judges who 
were blocked at the time by the cur-
rent Democratic leader. In fact, as 
Leader MCCONNELL has pointed out, it 
wasn’t even sort of a random thing. It 
was a planned strategy to start playing 
politics with the Federal Judiciary in-
stigated by the architect, the current 
Democratic leader, who, at the time, 
was holding workshops and seminars 
about how they could politicize the 
Federal judiciary and figure out new 
ways to block consideration of judges 
put forward to the Federal bench by 
then-President George W. Bush. That 
was a major issue in that campaign 
season, and, I would argue, one of the 
principle reasons that I am here in the 
U.S. Senate. 
Then, of course, when the chickens 
came home to roost and the same tac-
tics were used by the other side in the 
previous administration, as was point-
ed out again yesterday by Leader 
MCCONNELL, the Democrats decided to 
break the rules to change the rules in 
2013 to go to a simple majority to basi-
cally get and confirm judges on the 
Federal Judiciary. 
We are where we are today, notwith-
standing all the bluster that you just 
heard, because of a long, systematic 
strategy by the Democratic leader to 
block judges put forward by Republican 
Presidents. 
Despite all of what you just heard, 
tomorrow we are going to get to vote 
to confirm one of the most outstanding 
judicial nominees whom I have had the 
pleasure of considering during my time 
in the Senate. Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett is eminently qualified for the Su-
preme Court. 
By now, her accomplishments are 
well known: first in her class at Notre 
Dame Law School, Supreme Court 
clerk, beloved Notre Dame law pro-
fessor, 
outstanding 
scholar, 
circuit 
court judge. 
Americans, of course, got to see 
Judge 
Barrett’s 
qualifications 
for 
themselves a couple of weeks ago dur-
ing her Judiciary Committee hearing. 
For 2 days, she answered tough and 
probing questions from Democrats and 
Republicans, displaying a consummate 
command of the law and a calm and 
thoughtfulness that shows she has the 
kind of judicial temperament you want 
in a Supreme Court Justice. 
Since Judge Barrett’s nomination, 
the tributes have poured in from across 
the political spectrum: ‘‘Barrett is 
highly qualified to serve on the Su-
preme Court,’’ said Harvard Law Pro-
fessor Noah Feldman, one of the House 
Democrat’s 
star 
impeachment 
wit-
nesses. 
Patricia 
O’Hara, 
former 
dean 
of 
Notre Dame Law School, sent a glow-
ing letter to Judiciary Committee 
Chairman LINDSEY GRAHAM and Rank-
ing Member DIANNE FEINSTEIN. The let-
ter says: 
I was the dean of Notre Dame Law School 
at the time that Judge Barrett first joined 
our faculty. In that capacity I was respon-
sible for providing an environment in which 
she could flourish as a young faculty mem-
ber, but also for evaluating objectively 
whether she met the University’s high stand-
ards for scholarship and teaching required 
for advancement. This proved to be the easi-
est task of my ten years as a dean. Judge 
Barrett was (and remains) a stellar teacher 
beloved by students, a brilliant and nation-
ally-recognized scholar, and generous col-
league. 
She went on to say: 
I am confident that if she is confirmed by 
the United States Senate, she will be an out-
standing justice—brilliant, fair, impartial, 
and empathetic—and will serve to strength-
en an independent judiciary committed to 
the rule of law. 
Professor O’Hara also took care to 
note in her letter that she doesn’t 
write glowing reviews for Federal judi-
ciary nominees on a regular basis. In 
fact, she said the only similar letter 
she has ever written was in support of 
Democratic nominee Elena Kagan’s 
nomination to the Supreme Court. 
She went on: 
I feel every bit as strongly about Judge 
Barrett’s qualifications for a position as As-
sociate Justice as I felt about Justice Kagan. 
While I may not always agree with 
the American Bar Association’s judi-
cial rankings, they certainly got it 
right with Judge Barrett. That is I 
talking, not the professor. I am still 
struck by the testimony that the head 
of the ABA Standing Committee on the 
Federal Judiciary submitted to the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee. 
The 
ABA’s Standing Committee on the Fed-
eral Judiciary is the body that provides 
the ABA’s evaluations of Federal judi-
cial nominees. 
In his testimony detailing the ‘‘well- 
qualified’’ rating that the ABA gave to 
Judge Barrett, the head of the ABA 
committee noted: 
Lawyers and judges uniformly praised the 
nominee’s integrity. Most remarkably, in 
interviews with individuals in the legal pro-
fession and community who know Judge Bar-
rett, whether for a few years or decades, not 
one person uttered a negative word about her 
character. Accordingly, the Standing Com-
mittee was not required to consider any neg-
ative criticisms of Judge Barrett. 
That is quite a tribute. 
But, of course, ratings of ‘‘well-quali-
fied’’ do not just depend on character; 
they also depend on professional com-
petence. Here is what the ABA’s rep-
resentative had to say about that: 
Given the breadth, diversity, and strength 
of the positive feedback we received from 
judges and lawyers of all political persua-
sions and from so many parts of the profes-
sion, the Standing Committee would have 
been hard-pressed to come to any conclusion 
other than that Judge Barrett has dem-
onstrated professional competence that is 
exceptional. 
Along 
with 
her 
character, 
com-
petence, and command of the law, 
Judge Barrett brings a clear under-
standing of the proper role of a judge. 
She understands that the job of a judge 
is to interpret the law, not make the 
law; to call balls and strikes, not to re-
write the rules of the game; or, as 
Judge Barrett said in an answer to a 
Senator’s question, ‘‘I apply the law. I 
follow the law. You make the policy.’’ 
As Judge Barrett made clear in her 
hearing, she will be the kind of Justice 
who leaves her personal beliefs and po-
litical opinions at the courtroom door. 
She will look at the facts of each case 
and judge accordingly to the law and 
the Constitution and nothing else. 
When I came to the Senate, I hoped 
to have the opportunity to put judges 
like Amy Coney Barrett on the bench. 
I was proud to vote to confirm her to 
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in 
2017, and I look forward to voting to 
confirm her to the Supreme Court to-
morrow. 
I yield the floor.

OFFICER

BOOZMAN). The Senator from Cali-
fornia.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6454 
October 25, 2020 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in opposition to the nomina-
tion of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Just over a month ago, our country 
lost Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a 
leading voice for equality and funda-
mental rights. 
Judge Ginsburg’s nomination was the 
first that I participated in when I came 
to the Senate 28 years ago. At her hear-
ing, I had the opportunity to thank her 
for all she had done and for all she had 
yet to do. Before she was confirmed to 
the Bench, Justice Ginsburg played a 
critical role in breaking down barriers 
for women. 
During her confirmation hearing, she 
staunchly and forthrightly defended 
her positions as an advocate for equal-
ity, including her own support for a 
woman’s fundamental right to control 
her own body, the core holding of Roe 
v. Wade. 
Once confirmed to the Court, Justice 
Ginsburg worked tirelessly to ensure 
that the opening words of our Constitu-
tion, ‘‘We the People of the United 
States,’’ included all people, not just 
the elite few. 
The stakes are extraordinarily high 
in confirming a replacement for Jus-
tice Ginsburg in the best of cir-
cumstances, but for Republicans to 
proceed now, just 8 days before an elec-
tion, undermines, I think, the integrity 
and independence of the vote. 
Senate 
Republicans 
are 
breaking 
their own statements and promises by 
proceeding. In February of 2016, Repub-
licans refused to consider a replace-
ment for Justice Antonin Scalia be-
cause it was an election year. They 
blocked all consideration of President 
Obama’s nominee, Judge Merrick Gar-
land, claiming that the American peo-
ple should have the opportunity to 
weigh in on a Supreme Court vacancy. 
Leader MCCONNELL, at the time, clear-
ly stated the Republicans’ position: 
‘‘My view, and I can now confidently 
say, the view shared by virtually ev-
eryone in my conference, is that the 
nomination should be made by the 
President that the people elect in the 
election that is now underway.’’ 
Well, that is clearly not going to hap-
pen. 
Chairman GRAHAM, in 2018, reiterated 
this standard, promising that ‘‘if an 
opening comes up in the last year of 
President Trump’s term and the pri-
mary process has started, we’ll wait 
till the next election.’’ 
But when Justice Ginsburg passed 
away just 46 days before election day, 
Senate Republicans did not hesitate to 
go back on their word. On the night of 
Justice 
Ginsburg’s 
death, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL announced that President 
Trump’s 
nominee 
for 
the 
vacancy 
would receive a vote on the Senate 
floor. Chairman GRAHAM immediately 
set committee hearings for October 12, 
giving the committee just 2 weeks to 
review Judge Amy Coney Barrett’s 
record. This proved to be insufficient, 
as evidenced by Judge Barrett’s failure 
to identify and disclose significant 
amounts of material. 
Then, before Judge Barrett’s hearing 
had even concluded, Chairman GRAHAM 
held a markup on her nomination, and 
more rules were broken by setting a 
committee vote on her nomination for 
1 p.m. the following week. I, along with 
the Democratic side, refused to take 
part in that committee vote. This was 
not a decision that we made lightly. 
We were not willing to participate any 
further in a process that was used to 
rush this nominee forward in the mid-
dle of this election. 
Despite our objections to proceeding, 
Democrats demonstrated through the 
course of Judge Barrett’s nomination 
hearings what is at stake with her 
nomination, starting with Republican 
statements to use the Supreme Court 
to dismantle the Affordable Care Act 
and strip away healthcare coverage for 
millions of Americans. 
On November 10, the Supreme Court 
will actually hear oral arguments in a 
case titled ‘‘California v. Texas.’’ That 
is a case challenging the validity of the 
Affordable Care Act. President Trump 
promised to appoint Justices who will 
vote to dismantle this landmark law. 
In 2015, he stated: ‘‘If I win the Presi-
dency, my judicial appointments will 
do the right thing, unlike Bush’s ap-
pointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.’’ 
When he nominated Judge Barrett to 
fill Justice Ginsburg’s seat, President 
Trump stated that eliminating the 
ACA would be a ‘‘big win in the USA.’’ 
Even more recently, in an interview 
with 60 minutes, President Trump said 
he ‘‘hopes’’ the Supreme Court will 
strike down the ACA, and he believes 
‘‘it’ll be so good if they end it.’’ 
Let us not forget, after all, that Jus-
tice Ginsburg joined a 5-to-4 majority 
when the Supreme Court upheld the 
ACA against Republican-led challenges 
in NFIB v. Sebelius and King v. 
Burwell. 
Like President Trump, Judge Barrett 
has criticized the upholding of the Af-
fordable Care Act. In NFIB v. Sebelius, 
she stated that Chief Justice Roberts 
‘‘pushed the Affordable Care Act be-
yond its plausible meaning to save the 
statute.’’ 
She also cast doubt on the Chief Jus-
tice’s opinion in King v. Burwell and 
said that he departed from the ‘‘clear 
text’’ of the statute to avoid gutting it. 
She likewise claimed that the dissent 
had the ‘‘better of the legal argument.’’ 
At her confirmation hearing, Judge 
Barrett did not answer questions about 
her view on the ACA and did not mean-
ingfully walk back her criticism of 
these two 5-to-4 Supreme Court deci-
sions upholding the law. 
She also implied that coverage of 
preexisting conditions is not at issue in 
California 
v. 
Texas. 
However, 
the 
Trump administration is directly ask-
ing the Court to strike down the entire 
Affordable Care Act, including its pro-
tections for patients with preexisting 
conditions. 
Let me be perfectly clear. I believe, if 
Judge Barrett is confirmed, Americans 
could well lose the significant benefits 
that the Affordable Care Act provides. 
More than 130 million Americans have 
preexisting conditions, like cancer, 
asthma, or even COVID–19, and they 
could then be denied coverage. 
At Judge Barrett’s hearing, we heard 
the stories of real Americans who will 
be harmed and who illustrate what is 
at stake. This included a constituent of 
mine, Krystyna Munro Garcia, who, be-
cause of the Affordable Care Act, re-
ceived cataract surgery that saved her 
eyesight. 
It included North Carolina mom 
Stacy Staggs, who testified that the 
Affordable Care Act had ensured her 
twin girls received the lifesaving treat-
ments they needed. 
It also included Dr. Farhan Bhatti, a 
family physician, working with low-in-
come patients in Lansing, MI, who told 
the committee that opposition to the 
ACA ‘‘endangers a lifeline that [his] pa-
tients count on to stay healthy, and in 
many cases, to stay alive.’’ 
I deeply believe that Senate Repub-
licans should not be moving forward on 
a Justice who will likely help strip 
healthcare from millions of Americans, 
particularly in the middle of a global 
pandemic that has already taken more 
than 225,000 American lives. 
Judge 
Barrett 
also 
represents 
a 
threat to women’s reproductive rights. 
President Trump told us so when he 
promised to appoint Justices who will 
‘‘automatically’’ overturn Roe v. Wade. 
Judge Barrett has made clear that 
she would likely be the Court’s most 
extreme 
member 
on 
reproductive 
rights. At her hearing, she refused to 
state whether she agreed with the land-
mark case Griswold v. Connecticut, 
which established the right to use con-
traceptives. In addition, she would not 
affirm whether Planned Parenthood v. 
Casey, which upheld the constitutional 
right to abortion established in Roe, 
was settled law. She stated outright 
that Roe is not a superprecedent, indi-
cating time and again that continued 
efforts by anti-abortion activists would 
provide the Supreme Court ample fu-
ture opportunity to further limit or 
overturn Roe entirely. 
Now, this was a surprising departure 
from the last four Republican nomi-
nees, who acknowledged at their hear-
ings that Griswold was, in fact, settled 
law and that Roe and Casey were, in 
fact, 
important 
precedents 
of 
the 
Court. 
Beyond 
these 
specific 
examples, 
Judge Barrett’s view of precedent itself 
poses a continued threat to countless 
rights that Americans rely on and 
cherish. 
As an academic, she wrote that it is 
‘‘more legitimate’’ for a Justice to ‘‘en-
force her best understanding of the 
Constitution rather than a precedent 
she thinks clearly in conflict with it.’’ 
Essentially, what that states is that 
she will feel free to overrule precedent 
that she believes conflicts with her in-
terpretation of the Constitution. 
Judge Barrett’s record also raises 
grave concern about how she would

rule on cases involving voting rights 
and core democratic norms. 
In her dissent in the Seventh Circuit 
case Kanter v. Barr, Judge Barrett sug-
gested that voting rights were entitled 
to less protection under the Constitu-
tion than the right to own a gun. She 
distinguished between the ‘‘individual 
right’’ to own a gun and the ‘‘civic 
right’’ to vote. She argued that a fel-
ony conviction should not necessarily 
result in the loss of the right to own a 
gun but emphasized that it may result 
in the loss of the right to vote. 
She even refused to say whether vot-
ing discrimination exists even after 
being informed that Chief Justice Rob-
erts 
wrote, 
‘‘Voting 
discrimination 
still exists; no one doubts that.’’ 
Despite President Trump’s statement 
that he plans to challenge the results 
of the election in the courts if he 
loses—and that he wants his Justice 
seated in time to hear those chal-
lenges—Judge Barrett would not com-
mit to recuse from cases related to the 
upcoming election. 
In addition, Judge Barrett’s evasive-
ness at her hearing was deeply con-
cerning. She refused to answer over 100 
questions—not 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 but 
100 questions—including basic legal and 
factual questions. Let me give you an 
example. 
Judge Barrett refused to confirm 
that the Constitution prevents a Presi-
dent from delaying an election. That is 
a hint. She declined to answer whether 
Federal law prohibits voter intimida-
tion. She would not affirm that Medi-
care is constitutional. She even hedged 
on whether Presidents should commit 
to peaceful transfers of power, and she 
would not acknowledge the existence of 
climate change. 
Judge Barrett’s silence on these 
major questions really speaks volumes. 
It demonstrates that a Justice Barrett 
will not be willing to stand up for core 
American values and rights, and it 
raises additional concerns about her 
willingness to act independently of 
President Trump. 
In closing, it is my belief that Judge 
Barrett represents a threat to the very 
rights—including reproductive rights, 
the rights of LGBT individuals, and 
voting rights—that Justice Ginsburg 
worked so hard to protect, and for 
those reasons, I oppose her nomination 
and urge my colleagues to do the same. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you 
went across America and just picked a 
random person and said ‘‘Did you know 
the Senate is in session this weekend?’’ 
they, of course, wouldn’t know. You 
would say to them ‘‘Well, why do you 
think the Senate is in this rare 5-day 
session?’’ and they would say, I am 
sure, ‘‘Well, of course they are in a rare 
5-day session. We are in the midst of a 
deadly pandemic.’’ You would guess 
that would be the answer of most 
Americans. 
Why would they say that? Well, I 
know why they would say it in Illi-
nois—because the coronavirus in Illi-
nois has spiked to a newly confirmed 
daily COVID–19 State record as of yes-
terday, and 63 more deaths have been 
reported. Our positivity rate is over 6 
percent now, and the Governor and 
mayor are taking steps that they 
didn’t want to take but have no choice. 
They are closing restaurants and bars 
and imposing a curfew on the city of 
Chicago. 
You can imagine how they feel as 
more and more infections come rolling 
in and more and more people are dying. 
We have had almost 9,600 deaths so far 
in Illinois and, as we know, nationwide, 
over 225,000 deaths. 
But don’t believe for a second that 
this is a big-city problem because the 
New York Times reports this morning 
in its edition the names of the 50 coun-
ties across America with the worst per 
capita outbreaks of COVID virus with 
fewer than 10,000 people in the county. 
Senator THUNE was here earlier. His 
State of South Dakota has really been 
devastated when it comes to small 
counties, these counties—Bon Homme, 
Faulk, Harding, Miner, Buffalo, Oglala 
Lakota, Sully, Campbell, Brule, Tur-
ner, Jackson, Todd. Small counties. 
Rural areas. Smalltown America that 
used to say: It is a big-city problem. 
But now, sadly, it is a smalltown prob-
lem too. 
I am sure the Presiding Officer knows 
that on this list of 50 is Izard County— 
I hope I am pronouncing it correctly— 
in Arkansas and Lincoln County as 
well. 
Following me speaking will be a Sen-
ator from Colorado, and unfortunately 
Sedgwick County is included on this 
list. 
The point I am trying to make is 
this: This is a pandemic that is the 
worst we have seen in a century. More 
people are getting sick and more peo-
ple are dying than we ever imagined. 
We face this not just in big cities like 
Chicago but in small towns and small 
counties in my State of Illinois and ev-
erywhere. 
I pointed out the Senators who have 
been recently on the floor, but, trust 
me, this list includes a lot of other 
States even with Democratic Senators. 
It makes no difference. The virus could 
care less. 
With facing this at this moment in 
time, the American people would right-
ly think that we would be doing every-
thing imaginable, everything within 
our power to address this pandemic in 
this rare 5-day session leading up to a 
national election, but they would be 
wrong. They would be wrong because 
that is not our priority in the Senate. 
The priority in the Republican-con-
trolled Senate is the filling of a va-
cancy on the Supreme Court, and the 
nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, comes 
before us for a vote on confirmation to-
morrow after 5 days. 
The reason it is controversial, the 
reason it has to be rushed from the Re-
publican point of view, the reason they 
are hell-bent to get this done before 
the election is directly related to the 
pandemic. It seems like an odd cou-
pling. How did that happen? Well, it 
came down to this: The filling of this 
vacancy in an extraordinary way, since 
we have never—underline the word 
‘‘never’’—in the history of the United 
States filled a Supreme Court vacancy 
this close to an election—actually, in 
the midst of an election—it has never 
been done—the reason they are break-
ing all the rules, including the sacred 
McConnell rule, which was announced 4 
years ago, that lameduck Presidents— 
by his definition, Presidents in their 
last year—should have no authority to 
fill a Supreme Court vacancy—the rea-
son they have decided to ignore that 
sacred McConnell rule and go forward 
with this is because of one day that is 
coming up: November 10. 
You see, on November 10, the Su-
preme Court of the United States con-
siders the case of California v. Texas. It 
is a big deal on the Republican side. 
The purpose of that case is for attor-
neys general in Republican States and 
the Attorney General of the United 
States to strike down the Affordable 
Care Act. They want to make sure that 
Amy Coney Barrett has black robes on 
and is sitting in the Supreme Court 
when it is argued so she can be there 
when the critical vote to eliminate the 
Affordable Care Act occurs just a few 
weeks from now. If they don’t get this 
done by November 3, they are afraid of 
what might happen. Something might 
get complicated and they couldn’t get 
her on the Bench on time. 
If you think I am making this up, we 
have as a source for that information 
none other than the President of the 
United States of America—a President 
who 
never 
suffered 
an 
unuttered 
thought; a President who generates 
dozens of tweets every day and tells us 
exactly what is on his mind every wak-
ing moment. He made it clear to us 
that when it came to Amy Coney Bar-
rett, she was a priority. He promised 
long ago: I won’t put a Supreme Court 
Justice on the Court unless they will 
join me in eliminating the Affordable 
Care Act. 
So we knew that as a starter, and 
then he added as a grace note: And I 
want to make sure this Justice is on 
the Court so if there are any election 
contests, I will have nine Justices 
there. 
Not subtle, is it? 
That is why I said in the hearing and 
since that there is an orange cloud over 
this nomination—an orange cloud that 
emanates from the White House. And 
that is why we come here today, just 
hours before the final vote, under-
standing what is at stake if the Presi-
dent has his way, if the Republicans 
have their way.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6456 
October 25, 2020 
If Amy Coney Barrett is on the 
Bench by November 10, then she will be 
in a position to strike down a law 
which provides health insurance for 23 
million Americans. There is the link-
age I mentioned earlier. 
In the midst of a pandemic, with 8 
million Americans having been in-
fected; in the midst of a pandemic with 
over 225,000 American lives lost; in the 
midst of a pandemic setting new 
records as this COVID–19 virus invades 
our towns and cities and counties and 
States again; in the midst of this, the 
Republican leader, MITCH MCCONNELL, 
says we have no time to discuss 
COVID–19—no, but we have all the time 
we need to make sure we have our Su-
preme Court Justice on the Bench 
when the future of the Affordable Care 
Act is decided. 
There have been a lot of questions as 
to whether Amy Coney Barrett is 
qualified. She is impressive in her an-
swers to questions, if she gets around 
to answering them. I am sure that she 
has a head full of law. You can tell it 
when she answers, which is rare. You 
can tell why she was a law school pro-
fessor and now a circuit judge. 
But the purpose of our hearing was 
not just to figure out if she was smart, 
properly educated, licensed to practice 
law. All of that aside, the purpose of 
the hearing, from my point of view, 
was to try to determine not what was 
in her head but what is in her heart 
when it comes down to basic questions, 
because, you see, at the bottom of all 
this is the Affordable Care Act and its 
fate and the fact that she has published 
on more than one occasion her opinion 
of that law, and, not surprisingly, it is 
negative. 
I want to tell you in a moment—I 
want to get personal for a moment 
about this Affordable Care Act before I 
talk about Amy Coney Barrett and her 
philosophy. 
I want to introduce you to a young 
man from the State of Illinois. His 
name is Alex Echols. He is from Chi-
cago. I met with him recently. Big 
smile, right? Well, when he was 9 years 
old, two of his mother’s best friends 
were diagnosed with breast cancer and 
passed away before they reached the 
age of 50. As Alex moved into high 
school, his mother was diagnosed with 
breast cancer. Thankfully, she got 
treatment, and today, 20 years later, 
she is still in remission. Later, in high 
school, Alex lost his young cousin to 
leukemia. Shortly after that, his aunt 
passed away from lung cancer. 
Alex emphasized that all of these 
Black relatives and friends had their 
cancer discovered at a late stage, dem-
onstrating 
a 
discrepancy 
in 
early 
screening for communities of color. 
The Affordable Care Act helped to ad-
dress this disparity by ensuring free 
preventive screenings, including in pri-
vate insurance. 
Hear that. Ten years ago, when we 
passed this law, we ensured that people 
could get private screenings—early pri-
vate screenings for the detection of a 
cancer in its earliest stage when it 
could still be treated. 
As fate would have it, when Alex 
turned 29, he was diagnosed with non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He was unin-
sured at the time, but thanks to the 
Affordable Care Act, he was able to get 
enrolled and access the care he needed. 
He received treatment at several hos-
pitals in Chicago and ultimately chem-
otherapy and a lifesaving bone-marrow 
transplant at the University of Chicago 
Hospital. Today he is in complete re-
mission. How about that. He lives in 
Chicago with his wife and is active in 
leadership training programs and advo-
cacy. 
He wrote me a note and he said: Sen-
ator, ‘‘if it were not for the Affordable 
Care Act and being able to gain access 
to healthcare at that time, then I am 
not sure I would be alive right now to 
share my story.’’ 
Why do I tell you that story? Because 
the future of his healthcare depends on 
filling this nomination to the Supreme 
Court and whether the person who fills 
it is going to eliminate this law and 
protection or protect it. 
Here is another fellow I met. His 
name is Paul Marshilonus. I remember 
meeting Paul because, like me, he has 
Lithuanian heritage. We talked about 
it. I met him during an immigration 
event. 
Due to complications of a knee con-
dition, Paul Marshilonus was no longer 
able to work at the Sears store, and he 
lost his employer-based insurance when 
he was in his early sixties. 
Paul’s wife used to worry about rel-
atives who had cancer, and she said to 
him: ‘‘I hope that doesn’t happen to 
me, because we can’t get insurance and 
we have nowhere to go.’’ 
Then Paul received a prostate cancer 
diagnosis when he was 63—unfortu-
nately, 2 years too young for Medicaid. 
Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, he 
got enrolled in the Cook County 
CountyCare Medicaid expansion cov-
erage. 
I am happy to say that because I 
joined with Toni Preckwinkle, the 
president of the Cook County Board, to 
ask then-President Obama to give us a 
waiver so we could extend Medicare 
coverage early on under the Affordable 
Care Act. He gave us the waiver. We 
covered 120,000 people with Medicaid 
protection, and one of them was Paul. 
He was able to access the care he need-
ed, including 45 radiation treatments, 
totaling an insurance cost of $175,000. 
Today, Paul is cancer-free. He still 
depends on the Affordable Care Act for 
preventive screenings under Medicare. 
He currently takes seven medications— 
blood thinners, allergies, blood pres-
sure, metformin. If the ACA were to be 
eliminated, he would be charged more 
for those prescription drugs. 
That is another thing we did with the 
Affordable Care Act. We reduced the 
cost of prescription drugs for people 
under Medicare. When it is eliminated, 
that reduction will disappear. 
If Republicans succeed in termi-
nating the Affordable Care Act at the 
Supreme Court, Americans like Paul 
will pay the price. 
So you wonder why we are coming to 
the floor with these speeches late on a 
Sunday afternoon. Because these peo-
ple asked us to. They asked us to come 
up and stand up for them and say what 
they can’t say on the floor of the Sen-
ate. That is why we are here in the 
midst of a pandemic. That is why we 
are 
here—a 
nation 
that 
values 
healthcare as much as anything else we 
have as American citizens. 
That is why, when we asked Amy 
Coney Barrett some basic questions, we 
expected to at least get some indica-
tion of an answer. She wouldn’t answer 
basic questions. Senator LEAHY
was 
there; he was following it. What we saw 
was practiced avoidance of ever telling 
us the basics. 
You know, she styles herself as an 
originalist, and I will talk about that 
in a moment. An originalist supposedly 
values the Constitution—in fact, de-
pends on it; finds guidance in it that 
other people can’t see in the words, 
they find in the words; really delves 
into the Constitution; honors it; swears 
by it. Yet when we asked about basic 
constitutional principles—basics, writ-
ten in the words of the document 
itself—time and again, she would say: I 
really wish I could answer, but, you 
know, a case may come before the Su-
preme Court someday on that, and I 
am just going to have to duck that 
question. She wouldn’t tell us whether 
the President of the United States 
could unilaterally—unilaterally—delay 
the Presidential election. How about 
that? 
There are only three separate ref-
erences in the Constitution to that 
deadline and date for a Presidential 
election, and she couldn’t answer that 
question: Can the President unilater-
ally delay an election? 
She couldn’t tell us whether there 
should be a peaceful transfer of power 
from one President to the next. 
Please, Professor, Judge, you know 
in your heart of hearts that without a 
peaceful transfer of power, you don’t 
have democracy. 
When it came to the issue of voter in-
timidation—why did we raise that? Be-
cause there was a call to arms from 
some of the militia groups and others 
in this country to harass voters. 
She wouldn’t tell us whether she 
thought voter intimidation was unlaw-
ful. She wouldn’t even answer a ques-
tion I asked her in writing as to wheth-
er President Trump was legally accu-
rate in saying: ‘‘I have an Article II, 
where I have the right to do whatever 
I want as president.’’ 
‘‘Whatever I want as president.’’ 
Three separate branches, balance of 
power—I thought that was in the Con-
stitution the originalists venerate. It 
was not enough for Amy Coney Barrett 
to answer the question. She just said: 
It wouldn’t be appropriate. You know, 
a case may come before us someday— 
you never know. 
That is troubling. It is not a question 
of respecting her prerogatives as a fu-
ture Justice; it is a question of dodging

October 25, 2020 
a question over and over and over 
again. 
At one point, Senator KENNEDY, who 
will be speaking here shortly, asked 
her about climate change. She said: I 
really don’t have a view on that. You 
know, I hadn’t really thought about 
climate change. 
She is 48 years old, a lawyer, a law 
school professor, a circuit judge, a 
mother of seven, and it never crossed 
her mind about climate change, as to 
even whether it exists? 
Judge Barrett refused to comment on 
the landmark Supreme Court decision 
in Griswold v. Connecticut. That is the 
case in which the Supreme Court con-
firmed that there is a right to marital 
privacy and that criminalizing contra-
ception violated that right. It was a 
fundamental decision that led ulti-
mately to Roe v. Wade. She wouldn’t 
even opine as to whether or not that 
was properly decided. 
She 
wouldn’t 
commit 
herself—to 
recuse herself from election disputes 
involving 
President 
Trump 
even 
though his comments at a minimum 
have created an appearance of parti-
ality that warrants her recusal under 
the judicial recusal statute. 
I asked her in the 30 minutes ini-
tially that we were given to explain a 
37-page dissent in Kanter v. Barr. This 
was a case where a fellow named Rick-
ey Kanter ended up defrauding the Fed-
eral Government of millions of dollars. 
He was convicted of mail fraud. He 
ended up advertising that the cushions 
he had for shoes had been approved by 
Medicare. They had not. He then start-
ed selling them in volume across the 
United States, and he was caught at it 
red-handed. He ended up with a mas-
sive, multimillion-dollar civil settle-
ment, with a substantial fine and pen-
alty and 1 year in Federal prison. 
He came out after his year in Federal 
prison and said: I will tell you what is 
unfair. After all I have been through, I 
can’t buy an AK–47. What is wrong 
with my Second Amendment rights? 
That was the case—Rickey Kanter’s 
Second Amendment rights to buy a 
gun. 
So he brought this case before a 
three-judge panel on the Seventh Cir-
cuit, where Amy Coney Barrett was 
presiding with two other judges, and 
said: I want to assert my Second 
Amendment rights. It is just not fair, 
after what I have been convicted of, to 
say that I should be denied the right to 
buy a gun. 
Amy Coney Barrett spent 37 pages 
explaining why he was right, and the 
other two judges on the case went the 
other way in a hurry—both Republican 
appointees, I might add. But she stuck 
to her guns, so to speak, and said that 
as far as Rickey Kanter was concerned, 
it was just fundamentally unfair, you 
see, because he was just convicted of a 
felony, not a violent felony. Really? 
Then she went a step further in the 
issue of voting rights. She really got 
down to the basic question: Could you 
be denied to buy a gun if you ‘‘just 
committed a felony,’’ or could you be 
denied the right to vote if you just 
committed a felony—not a violent fel-
ony in either case. 
Well, she reached the conclusion that 
the right to bear arms and the right to 
vote were two different kinds of rights; 
that the right to bear arms was indi-
vidual, so Rickey Kanter, even if he 
committed a felony, could not be de-
nied a gun. But she went on to say that 
when it came to the right to vote, that 
was a ‘‘civic’’ right and that as a con-
sequence of it, if you committed a fel-
ony—not even a violent felony—you 
could lose your right to vote. What an 
amazing 
conclusion. 
That 
is 
the 
originalist’s mind at work. 
I had to remind her that she lives in 
the State of Indiana. Guns flow across 
the border from Indiana into Illinois 
and the city of Chicago. We have a vio-
lence problem in that city that is seri-
ous and deadly every single darn week-
end. Many of those guns—they trace 
them, incidentally, the Federal agen-
cies do—20 percent of those guns come 
from her State of Indiana and why 
many of them—criminals go to Indi-
ana, and many come from gun shows 
where there are no background checks. 
So you know what happens. The gang 
bangers and thugs drive over to Indi-
ana to a gun show, fill up the trunk of 
a car with guns, and head to the streets 
of Chicago. 
I said to her, she had to know this, 
living in South Bend, IN, with her kids 
growing up there. If she knew that, 
how could she be on the side of making 
it easier for anybody to buy a gun who 
has been convicted of a felony? But she 
did. Her originalism was at work. 
I 
want 
to 
say 
a 
word 
about 
originalism. Originalism is not just 
some foreign language you pick up on 
Babbel. It is a mindset. It is a mission 
statement. It is the belief that original 
text in the Constitution reveals all the 
answers to today’s challenges. 
Now, all of us here have taken an 
oath to support and defend the Con-
stitution. I don’t take an oath lightly, 
and I am sure none of my colleagues do 
either. But the question is about that 
document itself. Does it have in its en-
tirety what we need to know about our 
rights today in dealing with the con-
stitutional issues that come before us? 
Let me mention to you what the 
mayor of Chicago said a week ago when 
she was asked about originalism. 
Lori Lightfoot said: ‘‘Since the Con-
stitution didn’t consider me a person in 
any way, shape or form because I’m a 
woman, because I’m Black, because I’m 
gay, I am not an originalist.’’ Light-
foot said, ‘‘I believe in the Constitu-
tion. I believe that it’s a document 
that the founders intended to evolve, 
and what they did was set the frame-
work for how our country was going to 
be different than any other, and what-
ever was there in the original lan-
guage. But originalists say that, ‘Let’s 
go back to 1776 and whatever was there 
in the original language, that’s it.’ 
That language excluded, now, over 50 
percent of the country. So, no I’m not 
an originalist.’’ 
So let’s be very honest about that 
Constitution. Women could not vote in 
that original Constitution. African- 
Americans were not even counted as 
whole people; they were three-fifths of 
a citizen. And the list goes on. 
I still venerate it for creating the de-
mocracy we enjoy today, but I don’t 
believe that the Founding Fathers 
could possibly intuit where we are in 
America at this moment. What is at 
stake with originalism is this battle 
with judicial activism. What is behind 
this battle with judicial activism goes 
back to this moment. 
Here are the words of historian 
Heather Cox Richardson: ‘‘After World 
War II, under Chief Justice Earl War-
ren, a Republican appointed by Presi-
dent Dwight Eisenhower, and Chief 
Justice Warren Burger, a Republican 
appointed by Richard Nixon, the Su-
preme Court set out to make all Amer-
icans equal before the law. 1950s, they 
tried to end segregation through Brown 
v. Board of Education, prohibiting ra-
cial segregation in public schools. In 
1965, they protected the rights of mar-
ried couples to use contraception. In 
1967, they legalized interracial mar-
riage. In 1973, with the Roe v. Wade de-
cision, they tried to give women con-
trol over their own reproduction by le-
galizing abortion. 
‘‘The Justices based their decisions 
on the due process clause of the 14th 
Amendment, passed by Congress in 1866 
and ratified in 1868 in the wake of the 
Civil War. Congress developed this 
after the legislatures in former Confed-
erate States passed ‘Black Codes’ se-
verely limiting the rights and protec-
tions for formerly enslaved people. 
Congress intended for the 14th Amend-
ment to enable the Federal Govern-
ment to guarantee that African Ameri-
cans had the same rights as White 
Americans, even in States where legis-
latures want to keep them in some 
form of quasi-slavery. Justices in the 
Warren and Burger Courts used that 
same 
amendment 
to 
protect 
civil 
rights a century later. They argued 
that the 14th Amendment required that 
the bill of rights apply to state govern-
ments as well as the federal govern-
ment. This is known as the incorpora-
tion doctrine, but the name matters 
less than the concept: states cannot 
abridge the individual rights any more 
than the federal government. This doc-
trine 
dramatically 
expanded 
civil 
rights. 
‘‘But from the beginning, there was a 
backlash against New Deal government 
by businesses who objected to the idea 
of federal regulation and the bureauc-
racy it would require. As early as 1937, 
they were demanding to end the active 
government—active 
government—and 
return to the world of the 1920s where 
businessmen could do as they wished, 
family and churches managed social 
welfare and private interests profited 
from 
infrastructure 
projects. 
They 
gained little traction; the vast major-
ity of Americans liked the new system.

October 25, 2020 
But the expansion of civil rights under 
the Warren and Burger Courts was a 
whole new kettle of fish.’’ 
What I am sharing with you here is 
an amazing summary of Heather Cox 
Richardson. ‘‘Opponents of the new de-
cisions insisted the court was engaging 
in’’—hold on tight—‘‘’judicial activ-
ism’’’ in trying to strike down dis-
crimination 
and 
bigotry—‘‘taking 
away from voters the right to make 
the decisions about how society should 
work.’’ They said Justices were ‘‘legis-
lating from the bench.’’ 
Heard that before? 
‘‘They insisted the Constitution is 
limited by the views of its framers, 
that the government can do nothing 
not explicitly written in that 1787 doc-
ument. Faced with confusion over the 
exact meaning of the Constitution, 
some revised their position in a few 
ways. One was to rely on textualism or 
originalism, the idea that a law says 
exactly what it says and nothing else. 
This is the foundation for today’s 
‘originalists’ like [Amy Coney] Bar-
rett.’’ 
When you hear this debate, ‘‘I am 
just following the Constitution. I am 
just following the text. I want to go to 
the original document. I don’t want to 
see judges who are activists,’’ it had its 
origin in the 1950s when two Justices 
on the Supreme Court appointed by Re-
publicans stepped up and said: It is 
time for us to be serious about civil 
rights in America. Some politicians 
and those who support them have never 
gotten over it, and we are still debat-
ing it today. 
Let me conclude. I see my colleagues 
waiting patiently. I am sorry it took a 
long time, but this is as serious as it 
gets, as far as I am concerned. 
Let me conclude by saying this: 
There are so many issues of critical im-
portance at risk in what we are about 
to do. The 6-to-3 conservative majority 
in the Supreme Court will challenge 
not only the future of the Affordable 
Care Act but voting rights and the out-
come of an election, the right of pri-
vacy and choice, civil rights, environ-
mental protections, marriage equality, 
worker protections, the fate of Dream-
ers, gun safety laws, and so much 
more. 
We asked Amy Coney Barrett repeat-
edly, many of us did: Because the 
President has said he put you on the 
Court with a mission, and you are de-
nying that took place, will you at least 
promise us that you will recuse your-
self from cases directly relating to 
these issues? And she said she might, 
she might not; there was a process she 
might follow. 
There is something else she could do. 
You see, if this Senate goes forward 
and approves the nomination of Amy 
Coney Barrett, she has one last deci-
sion before she becomes a Supreme 
Court Justice. She gets to choose the 
day when she is sworn in. I would like 
to suggest to her, for the integrity of 
the Court and to remove any possible 
cloud over her nomination created by 
the President’s tweets and promises, I 
would like to ask her to pledge to the 
American people that whatever the 
Senate does, she will not take the oath 
of office until a new President is sworn 
in. If it is a reelection of President 
Trump, so be it. If it is Joe Biden, so be 
it. But if she will wait and absent her-
self from any election contest or de-
bate on the Affordable Care Act, it will 
start to remove this cloud of doubt, 
this orange cloud of doubt which is 
over her nomination. 
I am going to stand up for the con-
stituents I have talked about today 
and so many others whose futures hang 
in the balance, and I will vote no on 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
COLORADO WILDFIRES 
Mr. GARDNER. Mr. President, I look 
forward to coming to the floor and 
speaking about the nomination that is 
currently before the U.S. Senate, the 
nomination of Judge Barrett to be 
placed on the U.S. Supreme Court, but 
at this point, I think it is important 
that we talk about what is happening 
in Colorado as we speak because of the 
heroic men and women who continue to 
fight our Nation’s fires and certainly 
the devastating and catastrophic fires 
that we are seeing right now in Colo-
rado. 
This year we have already seen two 
of the largest fires in Colorado history 
burning over 200,000 acres—wildfires 
that started out at 20,000 acres, 25,000 
acres, and then within hours grew 80-, 
90-, 100,000 acres in a day. It is unheard 
of growth for wildfires. 
The picture that I am showing you 
here is Estes Park, CO. Most people 
may be familiar with Estes Park. It is 
the gateway to Rocky Mountain Na-
tional Park. You can see Lake Estes 
here and the town here. The town has 
been evacuated. A town of thousands of 
people has been evacuated because of 
two fires that are now threatening the 
area. 
One fire is the Cameron Peak Fire, 
which became the largest fire in the 
State’s history, only to be challenged 
by another fire coming through Rocky 
Mountain National Park called the 
East Troublesome Fire. Both are im-
pacting 
Rocky 
Mountain 
National 
Park. The city of Estes Park, the city 
of Grand Lake, and the city of Granby, 
overnight, they did receive a winter 
storm. It is snowing now, and it is re-
ducing the fire activity. It will not put 
the fire out. But my prayers and 
thoughts continue with the men and 
women who are fighting this fire so 
valiantly and the people in these com-
munities who are in harm’s way. 
We know that homes have been lost. 
We don’t know how many, but we know 
that homes have been lost, and we cer-
tainly acknowledge the loss of life that 
has already occurred. A couple in 
Grand Lake, who stayed in their home 
when the fire came through—they were 
together, but we pray for them and 
their families, and we mourn their loss. 
The East Troublesome Fire, which is 
the Medicine Bow-Routt National For-
est and Thunder Basin National Grass-
land, has a Type 1 management team 
already assigned. It is the No. 1 pri-
ority of the U.S. Forest Service in the 
country right now because of the ag-
gressive fire behavior, with spotting 
that has threatened places like Estes 
Park. There are evacuations, road clo-
sures, trail closures, and has over 500 
people, right now, assigned to this fire. 
The Cameron Peak Fire has about 
1,100 personnel working on the fire 
right now. We know about 470 struc-
tures have been lost. It is over 208,000 
acres. 
The Calwood Fire in Boulder County 
has a Type 2 management team fight-
ing the fire right now. Their evacu-
ation is in effect. There are nearly 400 
people fighting this fire. There were 28 
structures lost. 
The Ice Fire—an ironic name—in the 
San 
Juan 
National 
Forest, 
near 
Silverton, CO, we know that it is about 
600 acres right now. 
There is the Williams Fork Fire, 
which has been burning for months in 
Colorado 
and 
Grand 
County. 
In 
Arapahoe and Roosevelt National For-
ests, we know that there have been sev-
eral communities and energy infra-
structure threatened by all these fires. 
If you think about this entire town 
being evacuated, in the Colorado-Big 
Thompson Project, which provides a 
great deal of water to the Front Range 
of Colorado and through the South 
Platte River Valley, diversions were 
stopped, energy production impacted, 
and major utility transmission lines 
have been lost. 
And, of course, there is the loss to 
some of the most magnificent areas of 
Rocky Mountain National Park, per-
haps an untold story that we will learn 
about in the coming days. 
This Congress and past Congresses 
have not been idle in the work that we 
have done to protect our resources. In 
fact, in this last Congress, we put an 
end to a practice that was known as 
‘‘fire borrowing,’’ which involved raid-
ing accounts that were not meant to go 
to suppression of wildfires to pay for 
increasingly expensive firefighter sea-
sons. 
The fix for fire borrowing was in-
cluded in the 2018 spending package. 
What that means is we will no longer 
be cannibalizing funding for fuel reduc-
tion for mitigation that could have 
prevented a fire like this. Instead, we 
will be fully funding the firefighting ef-
fort and allowing those mitigation dol-
lars and those fuel reduction dollars to 
be continued to be used so we can pre-
vent this kind of fire from occurring. 
We have also passed legislation for 
water resilience projects and categor-
ical exclusions to help with forest man-
agement. We passed Healthy Forest 
Restoration Act language that includes 
fire and fuel breaks. We have worked 
on 20-year stewardship contracts with 
cottonwood reform. We have proceeded 
with reforms to fire hazard mapping

initiatives and to fuels management 
for protection of electric transmission 
lines and Good Neighbor Authority to 
help make sure we continue to give 
tools to our land managers. 
The 2018 farm bill built upon many of 
the reforms that we passed in the 2014 
farm bill changes. We have worked to 
expand the Collaborative Forest Res-
toration Program. We doubled its fund-
ing to help expand Good Neighbor Au-
thorities to Tribes and to counties. All 
of these tools will help us deal with the 
wildfires, but, certainly, they are not 
going to put this fire out today. 
So I come to the floor just to thank 
the men and women who are fighting 
these fires. To the leaders in these 
communities, 
the 
county 
commis-
sioners, the sheriffs, the law enforce-
ment personnel, first responders who 
have done a magnificent job in pro-
tecting structures, protecting their 
communities, protecting their people, I 
commend you, and know that you have 
the support of everybody here in our ef-
forts to give you the tools you need to 
do your jobs, to be safe, and to protect 
our greatest resources and commu-
nities. 
So, again, I look forward to coming 
to the floor to speak about Judge Bar-
rett and her nomination, but, for now, 
I think it is important that we take 
this time to recognize the challenge 
that Colorado faces and the need for 
continued work in this Chamber to ad-
dress forest management and Healthy 
Forest Initiatives to make sure that we 
can prevent these fires. 
These are some of the original beetle 
kill areas that came in 30, 40 years ago. 
It was an insect that deadened and 
downed trees that we knew at some 
point could be a major challenge if 
there was a fire, and that is exactly 
what we are seeing. 
I hope that all of my colleagues will 
join me in prayers for our State and 
States across the country that have 
been affected by wildfires and know 
that we have more work to do to pre-
vent the loss of some of our greatest 
natural resources. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
would like to spend a few minutes talk-
ing about the nomination of Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett to be an Associate 
Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. It is 
horribly newsworthy to say that Judge 
Barrett’s confirmation vote will not be 
unanimous. It should be. It won’t be. 
If you judged Judge Barrett solely on 
her intellect and her academic achieve-
ments, 
certainly 
her 
nomination 
should be unanimous. Any fairminded 
person would have to be impressed. She 
is an honors graduate of St. Mary’s Do-
minican High School in New Orleans, 
one of the finest schools in this coun-
try. She is an honors graduate of 
Rhodes College in Memphis, an ex-
traordinary liberal arts school. She is 
an honors graduate of Notre Dame Law 
School. She finished first in her class. 
She clerked for two of the most distin-
guished jurists in this country—the 
late Justice Scalia and Judge Silber-
man. She was a chaired professor at 
Notre Dame Law School. She is now a 
member of the Seventh Circuit Court 
of Appeals. Any fairminded person who 
reads her legal writings and her opin-
ions would come away impressed. 
If you judged Judge Barrett solely on 
her integrity, her confirmation vote 
should be unanimous. We all watched 
her almost 30 hours of testimony. We 
all know now about her beautiful fam-
ily. She has seven beautiful children, 
two of whom are adopted and two of 
whom happen to be children of color. 
She is a devout Christian. 
If you talk to her former students, to 
her colleagues, and to her critics, who 
know her well, they will all tell you 
that she is a person of integrity. And if 
you don’t want to believe any of those 
people—I wish you could, and I know 
the Presiding Officer can—but I wish 
the American people could see her FBI 
background check. The Presiding Offi-
cer and I know that when the FBI 
checks your background, it is kind of a 
combination between an endoscopy and 
a colonoscopy. They are pretty thor-
ough. There is not a hint of scandal. 
If Judge Barrett were being judged on 
the basis of her temperament, she 
would be a unanimous choice as well. 
We saw that in her 30 hours of testi-
mony. She listens well. She answers 
truthfully. She suffers fools gladly. I 
was just so impressed watching her. 
The reason that Judge Barrett will 
not be a unanimous choice, at least 
within this body, has to do with a little 
bit of history. This is one person’s 
point of view, but I think history will 
prove that I am correct. For the last 60 
years in America, we have been moving 
from a representative government and 
more to what I will call declarative 
government. We, as you know, are a de-
mocracy. We are not a pure democracy, 
unlike Athens, for example. When we 
have to make a decision on social or 
economic policy, each of us doesn’t put 
on a fresh toga and go down to the 
forum or the public square and vote. 
We elect representatives to make those 
decisions for us at the Federal level. 
They are called Members of Congress, 
and they are accountable. The people 
have given their power to our rep-
resentatives, and if those representa-
tives don’t exercise that power in mak-
ing social and economic policy, those 
representatives can be unelected. 
But in the last 60 years, in some 
cases voluntarily and in some cases in-
voluntarily, this body, the U.S. Con-
gress, which under our Constitution is 
supposed to make social and economic 
policy as representatives of the people, 
has, as I said, in some cases voluntarily 
and in some cases involuntarily, ceded 
our power—ceded it to the administra-
tive state and to the judiciary. 
Let me talk for a moment about the 
administrative state. Some would call 
it the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy 
now at the Federal level is a giant 
rogue beast. It enjoys power once only 
known by Kings and Queens. The ad-
ministrative state makes its own laws, 
called rules; interprets its own laws; 
and enforces its own laws before judges 
that the bureaucracy itself appoints. 
We in the U.S. Congress have allowed 
that. The judiciary has helped the ad-
ministrative state gather that power as 
well. 
As you know, there is a rule called 
the Chevron doctrine. I won’t bore you 
with the details, but it basically says 
that if the administrative state—the 
bureaucracy—interprets a rule or regu-
lation or even a statute in a ‘‘reason-
able way,’’ whatever that is, the judici-
ary is going to defer to them. The U.S. 
Congress has also ceded much of its 
power to the judiciary, and we have 
had many Federal judges that greedily 
accepted it. 
The reason that we will not have a 
unanimous vote for this eminently 
qualified nominated jurist is because of 
that. Some people in America and some 
of my colleagues like the fact that the 
U.S. Supreme Court, for the last 60 
years, has not demonstrated judicial 
restraint. 
Now, I am not going to stand here 
and tell you that the U.S. Supreme 
Court doesn’t make law. Of course it 
makes law. It makes law in a par-
ticular case—one side wins; one side 
loses. Sometimes the U.S. Supreme 
Court makes law at the direction of 
Congress and at the direction of our 
Founders. 
Our Constitution only prohibits un-
reasonable searches and seizures. We 
look to Federal judges to the U.S. Su-
preme Court to tell us what ‘‘reason-
able’’ and ‘‘unreasonable’’ means, but 
in all cases our Federal judges and the 
U.S. Supreme Court is supposed to 
demonstrate judicial restraint. When it 
is a close question, when it is a matter 
of social—major social or economic 
policy, then the Federal judiciary is 
supposed to show deference to the U.S. 
Congress, but more and more it does 
not. 
Some Americans like that. Some of 
my colleagues in this Chamber like 
that. They think that the U.S. Su-
preme Court ought to be a mini-Con-
gress. They think that the U.S. Su-
preme Court should be a political body. 
They like the fact that if they can’t 
pass a law changing social and eco-
nomic policy through the U.S. Con-
gress, they get a second bite at the 
apple and can go to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. I don’t believe that is constitu-
tional nor does Judge Barrett, I have 
concluded after 30 hours of testimony, 
and that is why her confirmation will 
not be unanimous in this body. 
Let me tell you what I believe—and I 
will preface this by saying, after listen-
ing to Judge Barrett for 30 hours, this 
is what I believe she believes: I believe 
that Madison and his colleagues got it 
right. I believe that we should have 
three equal branches of government. I 
believe we should have checks and bal-
ances. I believe that just because those

branches of government are equal, that 
doesn’t mean they are the same. I 
think their Founders intended each of 
those branches to have their own spe-
cial role, scope, and mission. 
I also believe that our Founders felt 
they were laying the foundation for a 
representative democracy, that Con-
gress would make the important eco-
nomic and social policy in this coun-
try; that when we talk about how soci-
eties meet our human needs, our Amer-
icans meet their human needs in terms 
of security, education, work, health, 
and well-being, that those decisions 
would be made by the people, not by 
the judiciary or the bureaucracy. They 
would then be made by people through 
their elective representatives. 
I believe that our Founders intended 
Federal judges’ role to be to tell us 
what the law is as enacted by Congress, 
not what the law ought to be. I believe 
our Founders intended for Federal 
judges to call the balls and the 
strikes—sometimes in doing so making 
law in a particular case, but to call the 
balls and the strikes, as Justice Rob-
erts put it. And in doing so, I don’t be-
lieve our Founders intended for Federal 
judges to be able to draw their own 
strike zone. 
I do not believe that our Founders in-
tended for Federal judges to be politi-
cians in robes. I do not believe that our 
Founders intended Federal judges— 
and, certainly, not members of the U.S. 
Supreme Court—to be able to rewrite 
the U.S. Constitution to satisfy some 
political or social agenda every other 
Thursday that the American people 
will not accept through their elected 
Members of this body and the House of 
Representatives. It is called judicial re-
straint. 
Judge Barrett shares it. It is con-
troversial. It shouldn’t be. But that is 
why, in my judgment, her confirmation 
vote will not be unanimous. I will be 
voting for Judge Barrett. I will be 
doing so enthusiastically. 
She is one of the finest legal minds I 
have ever seen, and she understands 
the role of the U.S. Supreme Court 
under our Constitution. 
I yield the floor to the senior Senator 
from Vermont. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just 4 
weeks ago, Members of the Senate 
gathered just down the hallway in 
Statuary Hall. We gathered to honor 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the first 
woman to lie in state at the U.S. Cap-
itol. Justice Ginsburg was a trail-
blazer, a woman who may have stood 
at just over five feet tall but was none-
theless a giant of the law. The nation 
grieved for her, not simply because she 
wasa a brilliant lawyer and Justice, 
but because she was a fighter. And she 
fought for those who needed fighting 
for most—Americans for whom the 
promise of America was still just a 
promise. 
I have spoken at length about what 
Justice Ginsburg meant to the struggle 
for equality for millions of Americans. 
I will not repeat those words today, ex-
cept to say that Justice Ginsburg’s 
life’s work left our nation a more per-
fect union. We will forever be in her 
debt. 
A day after we gathered in Statuary 
Hall, with the nation in mourning—and 
days before Justice Ginsburg was laid 
to rest with her husband in Arlington 
Cemetery—the 
President 
held 
a 
celebratory ceremony to nominate her 
replacement. The masks were off at 
that Rose Garden ceremony, in more 
ways than one. Republicans made it 
clear they would stop at nothing to 
confirm Justice Ginsburg’s replace-
ment before a Presidential election 
just weeks away. Yes, the masks were 
off. 
From that moment, the confirmation 
process for Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
has been a caricature of illegitimacy. I 
will not dispute that it is the responsi-
bility of this body to consider Justice 
Ginsburg’s replacement to the Supreme 
Court. But this is not how we should do 
it. 
Not during such a polarizing time for 
our country, just one week from a 
Presidential election after more than 
57 million Americans have already 
voted. Not at the expense of every 
precedent and principle this institution 
once stood for. Not when doing so re-
quires that half of the United States 
Senate go back on their word, contra-
dicting every argument they once 
made about Supreme Court vacancies 
during an election year. Not when this 
sprint to confirm Judge Barrett gave 
the Judiciary Committee just 2 weeks 
to prepare for her hearings, when the 
Committee has afforded itself three 
times as long to vet other modern 
nominees to our nation’s highest court. 
Not when records of Judge Barrett’s 
undisclosed speeches and materials 
have continued to pour in, even after 
her hearings, revealing what a slipshod 
process this has been from start to fin-
ish. And not when the Senate is doing 
nothing—nothing—to 
pass 
a 
des-
perately needed COVID relief bill. 
Every Senator knows in their heart 
this is wrong. 
Senator MCCONNELL
ramming this 
nomination through no matter the 
cost, while worrying about the politics 
of providing relief to millions of Amer-
icans suffering during this still-wors-
ening pandemic—which has left 225,000 
Americans dead—says everything one 
needs to know about the priorities of 
today’s Republican Party. Yes, the 
masks are off. 
It is far from a secret why President 
Trump and Senate Republicans are 
hell-bent on confirming Judge Barrett 
before Election Day. All you have to do 
is look at the calendar: On November 
10, the Supreme Court will hear argu-
ments in California v. Texas, the Re-
publican-led lawsuit to strike down the 
Affordable Care Act. And Republicans 
see a Justice Barrett as an insurance 
policy to ensure there will be a five- 
vote majority to finally strike down 
the law. 
Judiciary 
Committee 
Republicans 
spent last week crying foul, com-
plaining that it is fearmongering to 
claim that they see this vacancy as an 
opportunity to overturn the ACA. But 
fear mongering implies that we’re not 
talking about the facts. So let’s review 
some basic facts. 
It is the Republican Attorneys Gen-
eral who are asking the Court to throw 
out the entire ACA. Not just part of 
it—all of it. It is the Trump Justice De-
partment that has sided with the Re-
publican-led lawsuit. And it is this Re-
publican-led Senate, in a vote just 
weeks ago, that gave the green light to 
the Trump Justice Department to take 
this position—a position that, if suc-
cessful, would terminate health insur-
ance for more than 20 million Ameri-
cans, terminate the Medicaid expan-
sion for 15 million more, and terminate 
protections for 130 million Americans 
with preexisting conditions. While dis-
appointing, this Senate vote was hard-
ly surprising. Republicans in Congress 
have now voted to repeal or gut the 
ACA at least 70 times—seventy, as in 
seven-zero. 
As if Republicans could not be clear-
er about their intentions, just days ago 
President Trump was asked on na-
tional television about the fate of the 
ACA before the Supreme Court. He 
said: ‘‘I hope that they end it. It’ll be 
so good if they end it.’’ 
Like 
Captain 
Ahab 
of 
Herman 
Melville’s 
Moby 
Dick, 
Republicans 
have been single-mindedly obsessed 
with killing the ACA—their great 
white whale—since the moment the 
law was enacted. Having failed thus far 
in both Congress and the courts, they 
see Judge Barrett as the final harpoon 
to once and for all end the law. So 
when Republicans plead innocent and 
claim they have no intentions of tak-
ing away people’s health care protec-
tions, Americans will remember that 
their actions speak much louder than 
their words. 
And Republicans have yet another 
horse in this race—that is, the actual 
race for the White House and Congress. 
Always one to say the quiet part out 
loud, President Trump has repeatedly 
stated his expectation that his nomi-
nee will side with him in any election- 
related dispute. Baselessly claiming 
that Democrats have ‘‘rigged’’ the elec-
tion and falsely labeling mail-in bal-
lots as a ‘‘scam,’’ President Trump 
promises to challenge any election loss 
in the courts. That’s why he says ‘‘it’s 
very important that we have nine jus-
tices.’’ Another Republican on the Ju-
diciary Committee has echoed the 
President, claiming that the ‘‘entire 
reason’’ they need Judge Barrett con-
firmed now is to ensure that no elec-
tion-related dispute is deadlocked in a 
4 to 4 decision. Mind you, I do not re-
call Republicans making this argument 
when they blocked Judge Merrick Gar-
land from receiving a vote for 8 months 
prior to the last presidential election. 
Just this week, we have seen why Re-
publicans are all of a sudden so anxious

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6461 
October 25, 2020 
to have a ninth justice seated before 
Election Day. The Republican Party is 
waging an all-out war on voting in the 
courts right now, with the goal of 
disenfranchising as many minority, 
poor, elderly, vulnerable, and young 
voters as possible. Knowing that voters 
are relying on mail-in ballots in the 
midst of the COVID–19 pandemic, Re-
publicans are unapologetically fighting 
State and local attempts to make ab-
sentee voting easier. 
And it’s clear that Republicans be-
lieve having Judge Barrett on the 
Court will help them to suppress the 
vote. Last week, deadlocked 4 to 4, the 
Supreme Court left in place a Pennsyl-
vania supreme court order requiring of-
ficials to count absentee ballots re-
ceived within 3 days of the election. 
Yesterday, 
anticipating 
Judge 
Barrett’s imminent confirmation may 
tip the scale, the Pennsylvania Repub-
lican Party asked the Supreme Court 
to review the case again—less than a 
week after losing the first time. 
Unfortunately, for her part, Judge 
Barrett said nothing during her hear-
ings last week to assuage the American 
people that she would be anything but 
a green light for the deeply harmful, 
unpopular 
objectives 
of 
President 
Trump and Republicans. 
First and foremost, Judge Barrett re-
peatedly declined to distance herself 
from her litany of anti-ACA comments 
and writings. She also repeatedly de-
clined to confirm whether she would 
follow Supreme Court precedent up-
holding the ACA. 
Judge Barrett once wrote: ‘‘However 
cagey a justice may be at the nomina-
tion stage, her approach to the Con-
stitution 
becomes 
evident 
in 
. . . 
[what] 
she 
writes.’’ 
Using 
Judge 
Barrett’s own standard, then, one can-
not escape the conclusion that she will 
view the ACA as a Justice the same 
way she has always viewed the ACA: 
unconstitutional and unsalvageable. 
My concerns only grew when Judge 
Barrett refused to commit to recusing 
herself from any election-related dis-
putes. President Trump has put Judge 
Barrett in an unenviable position by 
making it impossible for Americans 
not to question her impartiality should 
she vote in his favor in an election dis-
pute. If a Justice Barrett votes to 
throw 
the 
election 
for 
President 
Trump, I fear not just the Court but 
our democracy itself would suffer an 
existential blow to its legitimacy. 
My concerns grew into alarm when 
Judge Barrett refused to affirm even 
the most basic tenets of our democ-
racy. She would not affirm to me that 
a president must comply with a court 
order and the Supreme Court has the 
final word. She would not state wheth-
er the President can unilaterally post-
pone a Presidential election, despite 
the law clearly stating he cannot. She 
would not affirm to me whether our 
Constitution contemplates a peaceful 
transition of power, despite the 20th 
Amendment laying out the procedures 
for precisely such a transition. And she 
would not state whether it is illegal to 
intimidate voters at the polls, despite 
federal law explicitly making voter in-
timidation a criminal offense. I’ve 
never seen a self-described originalist 
so hesitant to merely restate the plain 
text of our Constitution and laws. 
In fact, Judge Barrett refused to say 
much of anything about pretty much 
everything. She refused to answer over 
100 questions during her hearings and 
over 150 written questions. She did so 
by spuriously invoking the so-called 
‘‘Ginsburg rule,’’ which falsely pur-
ports that the late Justice Ginsburg 
avoided answering any and all sub-
stantive questions during her con-
firmation hearings. 
Well, I participated in Justice Gins-
burg’s hearings. Justice Ginsburg gave 
detailed answers on a number of con-
stitutional issues, including unequivo-
cally affirming her belief that a wom-
an’s right to choose is central to her 
dignity. In all, Justice Ginsburg took 
clear positions on dozens and dozens of 
cases during her hearings. In stark con-
trast, Judge Barrett wouldn’t even re-
state—not even comment on or discuss, 
but just restate—black letter law. 
I have never seen such top-to-bottom 
refusals to answer basic questions in 
the 16 Supreme Court confirmation 
hearings I have participated in. But in 
some ways, it was only fitting that a 
confirmation process that has been a 
caricature of illegitimacy concluded 
with such hearings-hearings in which 
the nominee wouldn’t even acknowl-
edge that masks inhibit the spread of 
COVID–19, or that climate change is 
real, or that voter discrimination ex-
ists. I fear for what this means for the 
future of the Judiciary Committee’s 
confirmation process, now that Repub-
licans have reduced our committee’s 
role to a mindless rubberstamp of a 
President’s nominees, just as they have 
diminished the Senate to a subordinate 
arm of the executive branch. 
The Republican argument for pro-
ceeding in this way, just 1 week from a 
Presidential election, boils down to 
this: We have the votes, so anything 
goes. Yet, having the power to do 
something does not make it right. The 
damage that will be left in the wake of 
this confirmation will stain this body 
for generations. When the word of a 
senator is rendered meaningless, when 
the words ‘‘Advice and Consent’’ are 
rendered meaningless, then this insti-
tution will be rendered meaningless. 
Justice Ginsburg left us with a more 
equal and more perfect union. She 
stood up for the right to vote. She 
stood up for the environment, and for 
holding all those in power accountable. 
She stood up for the rights of women to 
be free from discrimination, to control 
their own bodies, and to be equal to 
men. 
She stood up for the rights of minori-
ties, the rights of the LGBTQ commu-
nity, and the rights of all those who 
have been marginalized. 
Judge Barrett, if confirmed, will not. 
Based on my review of her record and 
based on her testimony, I believe a Jus-
tice Barrett would set the clock back 
decades on all of the rights that Ameri-
cans have fought so hard to achieve 
and protect. 
I have said that Justice Ginsburg 
would have dissented from this process. 
The least I can do is join her. I will 
vote no. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it is a 
privilege to serve with the Senator 
from Vermont on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. He and I have been called, 
maybe, the odd couple on a number of 
issues like Freedom of Information Act 
reform and other matters. So we find 
ourselves aligned on that important 
issue, the importance of the public’s 
right to know. 
But it won’t surprise anybody to 
know—it certainly doesn’t surprise 
him to know—he and I have a different 
point of view on this nominee and on a 
few other topics as well. 
One of the ones I wanted to talk 
about briefly at the very beginning was 
the so-called Ginsburg rule. 
Senator LEAHY was there and Joe 
Biden was the chairman of the Judici-
ary Committee back in 1993 when Jus-
tice 
Ginsburg—then 
a 
lawyer—was 
nominated for the Supreme Court. Her 
record as a litigator for the American 
Civil Liberties Union placed her far 
outside of the mainstream of American 
law. 
She argued for legalized prostitution, 
against separate prisons for men and 
women, and had speculated that there 
could be a constitutional right to po-
lygamy—certainly outside of the main-
stream of American legal opinion. 
But when she was pressed time and 
again before Republicans to talk about 
those views, she said she would not an-
swer those questions. She cited, appro-
priately, Canon 5 of the Model Code of 
Judicial Conduct, which, among other 
things, forbids Federal judges or judi-
cial candidates from indicating how 
they will likely vote on issues that 
may come before the courts or from 
making any statement that would cre-
ate the appearance that they were not 
impartial. 
This rule is absolutely critical to an 
independent judiciary because judges 
must remain open-minded and be able 
to decide an actual case without pre-
judging that matter before it comes be-
fore them. Can you imagine what it 
would be like if you were a party to a 
lawsuit and came before a judge who 
had made a statement committing to a 
particular outcome during their judi-
cial confirmation hearing? Well, the 
unfairness of that is obvious. 
So I think Judge Barrett did what 
Justice Ginsburg did when she was be-
fore the Judiciary Committee, what we 
expect all nominees to do, and that is 
to not prejudge cases and to not give 
any hint or prediction of outcomes or 
run on a platform or an agenda. 
My view is that, if you had a judge 
who did or a nominee who did come be-
fore the Judiciary Committee and

make those sorts of commitments, that 
would be disqualifying in and of itself. 
That person ought to run for Congress. 
They ought to run for city council. 
They ought to run for the school board. 
They should not be a Federal judge. 
That is not what Federal judges are 
supposed to do. 
So I think Judge Barrett did exactly 
what a judge should do when they are 
confirmed. We still got to ask her a lot 
of 
questions, 
as 
Senator 
KENNEDY 
pointed out, over the 30-plus hours of 
questioning, 
and 
she 
was 
extraor-
dinary. 
It is obvious she had great command 
of the subject matter. There was a spe-
cial moment where I noticed she wasn’t 
taking any notes or writing anything 
down or referring to anything, and it 
struck me how strange it was, what a 
contrast it was that each of us, as 
members of the committee, had a small 
army of staff around us, that they had 
read every case, they had prepared big 
three-ring notebooks of information for 
us to get prepared to question the 
judge—but the judge had nothing in 
front of her. 
And I asked her to hold up what was 
sitting in front of her, and it was an 
empty legal pad—an empty notepad, 
excuse me—that bore the name ‘‘U.S. 
Senate’’ on the ink pad but nothing 
that she had written down. 
So it, I think, spoke volumes about 
her command of the subject matter and 
her fitness for this particular job. 
We have all talked about the support 
she has from professors at Notre Dame, 
where she has taught for a number of 
years, highlighting her impressive in-
tellect, her elegant legal analysis, and 
her manifest judicial temperament. 
Eighty-one former law school class-
mates from diverse political and other 
backgrounds shared their collective 
view that she embodies the ideal quali-
ties of a Supreme Court Justice. 
We have heard from Noah Feldman, 
Harvard University law professor, who 
tends to be more liberal, and he points 
out that Judge Barrett is a brilliant 
and conscientious lawyer who will ana-
lyze and decide cases in good faith, ap-
plying the jurisprudential principles to 
which she has committed. 
So, in short, Judge Barrett has the 
qualities we should all look for in a 
judge. I think it is telling that our 
Democratic colleagues, when it came 
time last Thursday to vote on this 
nomination, decided to boycott the 
markup. None of them appeared. None 
of them voted. So the vote, literally, 
was unanimous. All of the Senators 
there present voted to vote the nomi-
nee out of the Judiciary Committee 
and recommended that that nomina-
tion be sent to the floor. 
I suppose, if they thought it would 
make any difference or they really had 
something to say or a reason to vote 
no, they would have shown up, but they 
did not. 
Judge Barrett exemplifies the fact 
that judges aren’t players on a red 
team or a blue team; they are, as Chief 
Justice Roberts said during his con-
firmation 
hearing, 
umpires 
calling 
balls and strikes. We all understand 
the difference between an umpire and a 
player, and, simply said, judges aren’t 
players; 
they 
just 
call 
balls 
and 
strikes, and they make sure the rules 
of the game are enforced. 
Judges should have no biases, no fa-
vorites, no preferred outcomes. But 
somehow, in their anger about this 
nominee and about the fact that she 
will fill the vacancy left by the death 
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, somehow our 
friends across the aisle seem to have 
forgotten what the most basic role of 
judges is in America. Again, they 
pressed her, asking: How do you feel 
about climate change? How do you feel 
about abortion? How do you feel about 
every other hot-button issue that they 
could think of, and she appropriately 
invoked the Ginsburg rule and would 
not comment. Exactly what she should 
be doing. 
The other thing that I think is re-
markable about this nominee is she is 
obviously somebody who has soared to 
the very heights of the legal profes-
sion—teaching, being a judge on the 
Seventh Circuit, both of which qualify 
her for this job. But she is also a per-
son of great integrity and character. 
It takes self-restraint, it takes self- 
discipline not to use the power that 
Federal judges have to impose your 
own view or to choose a result. That 
takes a lot of self-restraint and self- 
discipline, and she has demonstrated 
her commitment to that judicial phi-
losophy and that approach. 
During the final days of soon-to-be 
Judge Barrett’s confirmation hearing, 
we heard from a number of witnesses 
about her, their experience working 
with her. I believe one of the most 
moving testimonials came from one of 
her former students, a young lawyer 
named Laura Wolk. Since graduating 
from Notre Dame Law School, Laura 
has earned some highly coveted clerk-
ships, including for the Court of Ap-
peals for the DC Circuit and the U.S. 
Supreme Court, just like her former 
professor. 
There is one fact about Laura that 
made her climb to these incredible 
heights as a young lawyer all the more 
impressive, and that is that she is 
blind. Throughout her life, Laura has 
overcome barriers that exist for indi-
viduals who are blind or visually im-
paired, becoming the first blind person 
to clerk at the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Laura spoke about her arrival at 
Notre Dame and the technology fail-
ures that were causing her to fall far-
ther and farther behind her peers. Obvi-
ously, she needed that technology that 
would help her compete. 
Settling into law school is tough for 
any student, and I can’t imagine the 
fear and frustration that Laura felt as 
she struggled to keep pace, at no fault 
of her own, because she lacked the as-
sistive technologies she needed to com-
pete on a level playing field. Laura did 
what any student would do, I presume, 
and that is she went to her professor 
and shared the weight she was car-
rying—a weight Judge Barrett eagerly 
picked up, saying to her: This is no 
longer your problem; this is my prob-
lem. 
Laura described the relief and grati-
tude she felt for her professor’s kind-
ness and generosity, not only during 
this interaction but in the years of sup-
port and encouragement that have fol-
lowed. I found Laura’s testimony in-
credibly powerful and a shining exam-
ple of the character that Judge Barrett 
will bring to the Supreme Court. 
We have all come to appreciate Amy 
Coney Barrett, the person—a woman of 
great integrity, humility, and compas-
sion who will bring tremendous value 
to the highest Court in the land. I am 
confident that if our colleagues across 
the aisle had any good argument ad-
dressing her qualifications or character 
or integrity, we would hear about it. 
The only thing that I have heard 
them say, which I cannot believe that 
they believe, is that somehow this is 
part of some great conspiracy to defeat 
the Affordable Care Act. You know 
what our colleagues across the aisle 
failed to mention? The merits of the 
Affordable Care Act is not even before 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States. It is a technical issue with re-
gard to severability. It is a doctrine 
that says that if judges find part of a 
statute unconstitutional—here, for ex-
ample, the individual mandate, which 
thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 
that penalty has been reduced to zero— 
whether if, in fact, that portion of the 
Affordable Care Act is unconstitu-
tional, whether the whole act fails or 
not. But judges are told to presume the 
constitutionality of statutes—to pre-
sume them. And so the burden is on 
those who would prove the unconsti-
tutionality to prove it. The burden is 
on them. If they can save a portion of 
the law by severing it—that is the doc-
trine of severability—they must do it. 
I am pretty optimistic that the Su-
preme Court, no matter how con-
stituted, will do exactly that—will fol-
low the traditional canons of construc-
tion and guidance that judges apply in 
cases like this. And really, the sugges-
tion we heard, including from my 
friend from Vermont just a moment 
ago, that this is part of a conspiracy to 
appoint the judge to the Court so she 
will then hear a case and result in a 
particular outcome is specious. It is 
also an insult—an insult to the judge’s 
integrity and character—because she 
could not in good conscience take the 
oath of a judge if she were part of a 
conspiracy to rule in a particular way 
on a case—any case—in the future. And 
she said, unequivocally, that is not the 
role of a judge. 
But that is the argument, and maybe 
that is the best thing they have going, 
and so they are sticking with it. It just 
doesn’t make any sense. It is totally 
out of character with everything we 
know about Amy Barrett as a person, 
as a lawyer, and as a judge.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6463 
October 25, 2020 
Instead of talking about the Supreme 
Court, we seem to hear another com-
mon theme, and that is to say that we 
could be working on a COVID–19 relief 
bill. We did pretty well through the end 
of March working together on COVID– 
19 relief. We passed four pieces of legis-
lation, totaling $3.8 trillion. But it has 
been a while since March, and we need 
to pass another COVID–19 relief bill for 
the individuals who are still suffering, 
through no fault of their own, who 
don’t have a paycheck—the enhanced 
unemployment insurance benefits, the 
Paycheck Protection Program that 
was so important to keeping small 
businesses’ ability to maintain their 
payroll. We need more money for test-
ing. We need to make sure that the 
therapeutics that have now come on-
line are available to people who are in-
fected with the virus. We need to make 
sure that the vaccine, once it is ap-
proved by the FDA, is available for dis-
tribution. 
That is why Senator MCCONNELL has 
repeatedly brought legislation to the 
floor to bolster our fight against the 
virus at this critical time. In par-
ticular, the first bill he offered them 
was to supply another half a trillion 
dollars to help small businesses keep 
their doors open and their employees 
on the payroll; to help schools keep 
their students and teachers safe; to 
strengthen testing and invest, as I said, 
in the continued success of Operation 
Warp Speed. 
What did our Democratic colleagues 
do? They voted no. They wouldn’t even 
get on the bill and then offer amend-
ments to make it more to their liking. 
So they just blocked it. 
I think this is consistent with what 
we heard from Speaker PELOSI when 
she said that ‘‘nothing is better than 
something.’’ It always strikes me as 
very odd because I have always be-
lieved that something is better than 
nothing, but apparently not in this 
strange environment leading up to this 
November 3 election, which, unfortu-
nately, I think is what is preventing us 
from passing a bill. 
Many of our colleagues believe that 
leaving people anxious and worried and 
fearful, not only about their health but 
also 
about 
their 
economic 
cir-
cumstances, advantages them leading 
into the election. That is what they do. 
They want to stoke fear and uncer-
tainty on the part of the American peo-
ple. 
When we offer concrete pieces of leg-
islation that would help relieve that 
anxiety, fear, and the sense that they 
are not receiving any income—how are 
you going to pay the bills or provide 
for your family—repeatedly, they have 
voted it down. I just find that abso-
lutely shameful. 
So here we are in October with 8.5 
million confirmed cases of the virus. 
When we talk about cases, that is kind 
of interesting. They are positive tests. 
We know the vast majority of individ-
uals will have little, if any symptoms. 
But we do know that there are vulner-
able populations that need to be pro-
tected, particularly people in nursing 
homes, assisted living facilities, the el-
derly, 
and 
those 
with 
underlying 
chronic illness. This virus can be dead-
ly, and that is why we need to take it 
seriously, wear our masks, socially dis-
tance, and do all the things that the 
Centers for Disease Control and other 
experts have advised. 
Our Democratic colleagues have not 
done anything to lift a finger to help 
people who are still hurting; people 
who are still anxious; people who are 
still worried about their health, about 
their children going safely back to 
school, about whether a vaccine will be 
available. 
Time after time, they blocked legis-
lation we have introduced in the Sen-
ate, since we passed the CARES Act in 
March, and they have simply refused to 
provide care that is desperately needed, 
relief desperately needed by the Amer-
ican people. 
My constituents in Texas, like the 
rest of America, have waited months 
for additional relief. I am ashamed of 
the fact that we could not find a way to 
come together and produce a result. I 
am ashamed of the fact that our 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
have forced them to wait even longer. 
I yield floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, I rise as our country faces a 
monumental choice. It is a choice 
about who we want to be as Americans 
and the future we want to build as 
Americans. All across our country this 
year, we have seen Americans standing 
up and speaking out for greater equal-
ity and greater justice. Our choice is 
this: Does the highest Court in the land 
stand with the people of America as we 
strive to build a more perfect Union, or 
does the Court side with the most pow-
erful interests and most extreme views 
that will take our country backward in 
our quest for justice and equality? 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett does not 
stand on the side of the American peo-
ple. She does not represent mainstream 
values—certainly, mainstream values 
that we cherish in Michigan. 
Right now, we are in the middle of a 
pandemic. Over 225,000 Americans have 
already died, and we are nowhere near 
getting it under control—nowhere. 
Instead of providing help to families, 
communities, and businesses that are 
suffering, 
Republicans 
are 
rushing 
through. Here we are on a Sunday, not 
talking about how we help people, help 
our small businesses, help our commu-
nities, do what needs to be done to get 
this pandemic under control. No, we 
are seeing a rush to get a Supreme 
Court nominee on the Court that will 
have disastrous consequences for our 
Nation, both for today and for decades 
to come. 
On behalf of the majority of the peo-
ple of Michigan, I am strongly opposing 
this nomination, and I urge my col-
leagues to do the same. 
Perhaps, nothing is more at risk 
right 
now 
than 
healthcare—the 
healthcare that Americans depend on. 
Exactly one week after election day, 
the Supreme Court, as we know, will 
hear arguments in the case that could 
very well overturn the Affordable Care 
Act in the middle of a pandemic—in 
the middle of a deadly pandemic. 
Republicans in Congress have tried to 
repeal the healthcare law for 10 years 
now—10 years. And each time, people 
across 
our 
country, 
people 
across 
Michigan, have spoken out. They have 
demanded that Republicans protect 
their healthcare. Healthcare is not po-
litical in the eyes of Americans. It is 
personal. They want us to strengthen 
and improve healthcare, not rip it 
away from them. But, unfortunately, 
Republicans have voted more than 100 
times in those 10 years—more than 100 
different times—to repeal the Afford-
able Care Act, and more than 100 times 
they have failed. 
So now President Trump has turned 
the job over to the courts. He expects 
Judge Barrett to, in his words, termi-
nate the healthcare law. That is the 
word of the person who nominated 
Judge Barrett. He wouldn’t have nomi-
nated her to the Supreme Court if he 
didn’t trust that she would do just 
that. 
Judge Barrett has already called the 
Court’s previous decision to uphold the 
ACA ‘‘illegitimate.’’ She publicly criti-
cized Chief Justice Roberts for uphold-
ing the law. She said that if the Su-
preme Court reads the statute like she 
does, they have no choice but to, in her 
words, invalidate it. 
This is not a mystery here about how 
she is going to vote. It is very, very 
clear. That would be a disaster for 
Michigan families, a disaster for people 
all across our country. Protections for 
the over 130 million Americans with 
preexisting 
conditions—gone. 
That 
number is going up every day because 
of COVID–19. 
Bans on yearly and lifetime caps on 
cancer treatments and other critical 
care—gone. Healthy Michigan, which 
has helped more than 880,000 Michigan 
residents get healthcare—gone. The 
ability for young adults up to age 26 to 
be covered by their family’s health in-
surance—gone. 
You can also say goodbye to guaran-
teed maternity care so you are going to 
pay extra if you want to have children 
and have maternity care, free preven-
tive health screenings, and birth con-
trol without copays. 
Seniors would see their drug prices 
go up. The ACA closed the Medicare 
prescription drug—what we call the 
doughnut hole, the gap in coverage, 
and saved the average Michigan senior 
more than $1,300 just in 6 years be-
tween 2010 and 2016—$1,300. 
Seniors would have additional reason 
to worry. During her confirmation 
hearing, Judge Barrett refused to say 
whether she believes Medicare and So-
cial Security are even constitutional. 
As is often the case, American 
women would have the most to lose if

the ACA is overturned. Remember 
when simply being a woman was con-
sidered a preexisting condition by in-
surance companies, and we had to pay 
more? I do. Yet the threat of Justice 
Barrett goes far beyond insurance 
rates. 
The 
fundamental 
right 
for 
women to make basic choices about 
our own healthcare, our own health, 
our own lives would be at risk. 
Since Roe v. Wade was decided in 
1973, women in our country have had 
the right to make our own decisions 
about reproductive choices that are 
best for our own health and our own 
family. It is among the rights that Jus-
tice Ruth Bader Ginsburg spent her ca-
reer defending, and it is not a right 
that Judge Barrett respects. She has 
long aligned herself with organizations 
devoted to eliminating a woman’s right 
to choose. She signed her name to a 
letter calling for Roe v. Wade to be 
overturned. 
During her nomination hearing, she 
refused to say whether Roe v. Wade is 
Federal law. At its most basic, Roe v. 
Wade is about undue government inter-
ference. Think about that—undue gov-
ernment interference, which we hear a 
lot about from our friends on the other 
side of the aisle. That is something 
that Republicans deeply oppose, at 
least when it is corporations that need 
defending from undue government in-
terference. 
Reproductive rights are only one 
freedom, as critical as they are, as that 
is, that are on the line right now. Over 
the past decade, we have made major 
progress in ensuring that our LGBTQ+ 
friends and neighbors aren’t discrimi-
nated against simply for being them-
selves. Yet Judge Barrett has openly 
opposed this progress, including speak-
ing out against the decision that made 
marriage equality the law of the land. 
She has even given numerous speeches 
on behalf of the Alliance Defending 
Freedom, 
a 
rightwing 
organization 
that thinks being gay should be a 
crime. 
Workers, too, could see their rights 
evaporate under a Justice Barrett. Bar-
rett would be just one more conserv-
ative Justice who will issue rulings 
that hurt the ability of workers to 
fight workplace mistreatment and dis-
crimination, and to organize and col-
lectively bargain for wages, benefits, 
and workplace protections. That is 
what she did in her decision Wallace v. 
Grubhub Holdings in which she ruled 
against workers who were denied over-
time wages—against workers who were 
denied overtime wages that are pro-
tected by the Fair Labor Standards 
Act. 
If a Justice Barrett sides with the 
powerful against people, I think we all 
know what that means for the future of 
our world. 
During her confirmation hearing, 
Judge Barrett refused to say whether 
or not she believes that climate change 
exists, saying she is not a scientist. 
You don’t need to be a scientist. Just 
ask people in Michigan about what is 
happening in our State. The climate 
crisis is already affecting Michigan ag-
riculture, our environment, our public 
health, our Great Lakes. 
A number of crucial cases dealing 
with the environment are likely to end 
up at the Supreme Court in the next 
number of years, and the Court’s deci-
sions will have consequences that out-
live any of us. Critically important to 
all American citizens is what Justice 
Barrett would mean for voting rights 
and the results of the 2020 election. Let 
me remind everyone that election day 
isn’t November 3, it is every day up to 
November 3. People are voting right 
now. If you have not voted, I hope you 
do and that you do it safely and do it 
early, but voting ends on November 3. 
People are voting as we speak and 
whether or not those votes are counted 
could very well depend on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
Judge Barrett refused to say whether 
she believes voter discrimination ex-
ists. Voter discrimination. Given that 
23 States have passed restrictive voting 
laws since the Supreme Court’s Shelby 
County v. Holder decision, it is pretty 
clear that voter discrimination exists. 
Judge Barrett has also refused to 
recuse herself from rulings on cases re-
lated to the outcome of the 2020 elec-
tion, even though President Trump is 
rushing to make sure that she is there. 
That is a clear conflict of interest if I 
ever heard one. There is no right more 
fundamental than the right to vote—no 
right more fundamental than the right 
to vote. Perhaps nobody knew that bet-
ter than our beloved colleague, the late 
Congressman John Lewis. He once said 
this: 
My dear friends, your vote is precious, al-
most sacred. It is the most powerful non-
violent tool we have to create a more perfect 
union. 
A more perfect union; that is what 
we want, isn’t it? That is what we are 
working toward every day, I hope. That 
is what Americans have been marching 
for and speaking out for and bleeding 
for and dying for as long as we have 
been a nation. 
We face a crucial choice. I am choos-
ing to stand with the vast majority of 
the American people on the side of jus-
tice and equality. I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
Judge Barrett. The American people 
deserve much, much better. 
Mr. President, there is one other 
thing that I need to do before yielding 
the floor. I would yield my remaining 
postcloture time to the Democratic 
leader. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PORTMAN). The Senator has that right. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
RECOGNIZING CRAIG JOHNSON AND AURASH 
ZARKESHAN 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I actu-
ally listened to the comments that 
were made by my good friend from 
Michigan, but I have to say this, that 
she is talking about someone who is 
considered by me and many others as 
arguably the most gifted jurist ever 
nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
I want to talk about that. 
I have something else to talk about 
first because I think people know 
Judge Barrett by this time, but they 
may not know a couple of people they 
should know about. 
Earlier this year, Aurash Zarkeshan 
or ‘‘Zark.’’ Because of the complica-
tions of his name, he is called that by 
most of his close friends. 
He was overjoyed. He had just grad-
uated earlier this year from the Tulsa 
Police Academy and was sworn in as a 
police officer. That was his life’s ambi-
tion. He was a guy who was so excited 
that he was taking that step. He was a 
shining example of everything that you 
want in a new officer. He was bright, 
engaged, committed to public service. 
He wanted to give back and make his 
community a better place. That was 
him. 
At the end of June, only 6 weeks on 
patrol, he pulled over a car for a rou-
tine traffic stop. As we all know, there 
is no such thing as a routine law en-
forcement process. He and Sergeant 
Craig Johnson pulled over a car, and 
what happened next was horrifying and 
tragic. They were viciously shot in the 
head during that stop, despite many at-
tempts to deescalate the situation. 
Tragically, Sergeant Johnson suc-
cumbed to his injuries. While Zark re-
mained in critical condition, Sergeant 
Johnson left behind his wife Kristi and 
sons, Connor and Clinton. That is him 
here on the left—dashing young man. 
In that moment of sorrow, the Tulsa 
community united in prayer and hope 
for the recovery of Zark. Since the 
shooting, Zark has undergone several 
surgeries. He spent months recovering 
in rehab. Throughout these months, 
Zark provided us with updates of his 
recovery and the progress he has been 
making. He even called into a class of 
new Tulsa Police Department recruits. 
He also went in person to his squad 
meeting and met with them. 
His progress is truly remarkable. As 
Tulsa Police Captain Kimberly Lee put 
it, ‘‘He really is an example for all of 
us.’’ That is exactly right. Zark is a 
hero. He persevered through extraor-
dinary pain and strife and is now mak-
ing a speedy recovery. 
Last week, on October 15, Zark re-
turned home from 3 months of rehab, 
and he was met by friends and family 
and supporters who welcomed him with 
open arms. Our mayor, G.T. Bynum, 
declared October 15 Officer Aurash 
Zarkeshan Day in the city of Tulsa and 
proclaimed 
that 
Zark 
is 
‘‘Tulsa’s 
Hope.’’ I couldn’t agree more. Zark em-
bodies everything that makes Okla-
homa great. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that proclamation be printed in 
the RECORD at the conclusion of my re-
marks. 
Zark wanted to give back to his com-
munity, and he delivered. October 15 
will hold a special place in the heart of 
the thousands of people who call Tulsa 
home.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6465 
October 25, 2020 
In August, I spoke on the Senate 
floor regarding the riots and anarchy 
happening around the country, but I 
was specifically referring to Portland, 
OR, and how these events and hateful 
rhetoric aimed at law enforcement 
have endangered countless brave men 
and women who serve in law enforce-
ment and how they have certainly de-
pressed them. They talk about things 
like peaceful protests. Yet, in that 
case, they were throwing bricks at offi-
cers. They sprayed officers, nearly 
blinding all three of them. This was ac-
tually going on. 
I highlight the contrast between the 
violence happening in Oregon with how 
we appreciate our officers in my State 
of Oklahoma—what a contrast. Oklaho-
mans have great respect and admira-
tion for our men and women in blue. 
We know that law enforcement officers 
are our neighbors, our friends, and our 
family. They have a dangerous job, and 
they go beyond that job. I was talking 
to some of them the other day, and dif-
ferent ones gave different messages. 
While they are on duty, defending 
rights, a lot of them teach young kids 
how to play baseball. They are really 
great citizens. 
In the speech that I gave in August, 
I highlighted the attack on Zark and 
Sergeant Johnson. These attacks are a 
painful reminder of the sacrifices that 
law enforcement make every day. 
‘‘Defunding the police’’ rhetoric may 
be politically appealing to some on the 
left, but we must remember that law 
enforcement is the first line of defense 
against threats like what we saw in 
Tulsa in June. 
I had the opportunity to talk to Zark 
this morning. He told me what was 
going through his mind while they 
were being rushed to the hospital. He 
said he was thinking: ‘‘I hope our story 
reaches the Nation.’’ 
Your story, Zark, has reached the 
Nation. It has reached the world. Right 
now, they know what happened. 
Zark wanted people to understand 
what police and law enforcement risk 
every day—a sacrifice too many take 
for granted. He wanted people to know 
the stories of good, honorable police of-
ficers. While his tragedy in Tulsa is a 
reminder of the threats our commu-
nities face, it is also a story of hope, of 
Tulsa’s hope. 
Jerad Lindsey, who is the chairman 
of Tulsa’s Fraternal Order of Police, 
said it best: ‘‘There’s not a lot of times 
you get to use the word ‘miracle’.’’ 
Zark’s recovery definitely fits that 
bill. 
Perhaps, what is most telling and 
most inspiring is that Zark doesn’t lose 
sight of what was lost on June 29. On 
his return to Tulsa on a day that was 
proclaimed to recognize his heroism, 
he wore a shirt that honored Sergeant 
Johnson. It read: ‘‘Fallen but not for-
gotten.’’ Even this morning, he talked 
about Sergeant Craig Johnson and how 
he had wanted him to return to Tulsa 
with him as he himself did last week. 
Now that Zark is back in Tulsa, he is 
going to keep up his recovery, but he is 
also looking forward to enjoying these 
simple things: his own bed, his dogs, 
his Whataburger—he has already been 
there twice—and the love and support 
of all Tulsans. 
While there are many challenges and 
hardships ahead for Tulsa and the Na-
tion with this tragedy, this is a story 
of optimism and faith in our commu-
nity and in our future. Both Zark and 
Sergeant Johnson are American he-
roes, and they will always be American 
heroes. So we say thanks to Zark. 
Thanks, Zark. You are great. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE HONORABLE GT BYNUM 
PROCLAMATION 
Whereas, on June 29, 2020, Officer Aurash 
Zarkeshan placed himself in harms way to 
protect and serve the citizens of Tulsa and 
the men and women of the Tulsa Police De-
partment. 
Whereas, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan en-
dured more than three months of rehabilita-
tion and multiple surgeries. His bravery and 
positive outlook throughout his journey are 
admirable and have been an inspiration to 
the city. 
Whereas, 
Officer 
Aurash 
Zarkeshan’s 
strength and perseverance have set an exam-
ple to the Tulsa Police Department and he 
has been a beacon of light for law enforce-
ment officers around the county. 
Whereas, Officer Aurash Zarkeshan has 
been declared ‘‘Tulsa’s Hope’’ for his service, 
courage, and valor under fire. 
Whereas, Tulsans are excited on this day 
to welcome Officer Aurash Zarkeshan home. 
Now, therefore, I, Gt Bynum, Mayor of the 
City of Tulsa, do hereby proclaim October 
15th as ‘‘Officer Aurash Zarkeshan Day’’ in 
the City of Tulsa. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have 
already talked a couple of times about 
this great nominee whom we have in 
Amy Coney Barrett, and I am really 
proud to speak in support of President 
Trump’s outstanding nomination of 
Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
To say that Judge Barrett is quali-
fied to serve on the Supreme Court is 
an understatement. Judge Barrett is 
the definition of a leader. Her record of 
accomplishments is second to none. Ev-
erybody knows it. 
After we had a chance to really 
evaluate and talk to her and know her 
and visit with her, we found that she 
was born in New Orleans. She went on 
to graduate from Rhodes College in 
Memphis and also from Notre Dame 
Law School. She graduated at the top 
of her class and always has been at the 
top of her class. That is worth pointing 
out because, when confirmed, she will 
be the only Justice on the bench who 
did not go to Harvard or Yale. Now, 
that is a good thing. She clerked for 
one of America’s finest Supreme Court 
Justices—the 
late 
Antonin 
Scalia. 
Since 2002, she has taught law at Notre 
Dame, where she has been selected 
‘‘Distinguished Professor of the Year’’ 
three different times. 
In 2017, after being attacked by the 
Democrats about her strong faith, she 
was confirmed to the Seventh Circuit 
by this body—and with Democratic 
votes, I might add. Let me repeat that. 
She was confirmed on a bipartisan 
basis only 3 years ago. But, today, lib-
erals are recycling their same stale 
tactics in an attempt to tarnish an-
other exceptional nominee without 
having any basis in fact or truth. They 
are attacking her Catholic faith. Some 
operatives have even attacked her for 
adopting children from Haiti. I am not 
kidding. They are attacking her for 
that. It should go without saying that 
Judge Barrett should be commended 
for this loving, selfless act, not dispar-
aged for it. 
I personally know that adoption is 
one of God’s greatest gifts. I am the 
proud grandfather of Zegita Marie. I 
found her during a mission in Ethiopia, 
and my daughter and son-in-law adopt-
ed her as a baby. She is in college now 
and is one of my greatest blessings. 
Yet, like clockwork, the Democrats 
use bogus propaganda to try to scare 
the American people into opposing a 
Republican President’s Supreme Court 
nominee. Over the years, they have 
made outrageous claims, like saying 
these nominees will take away Amer-
ica’s healthcare. They have done it 
time and again. They did it with An-
thony Kennedy. They did it with David 
Souter. They did it with John Roberts 
and, recently, with Brett Kavanaugh. 
Now they are doing it with Judge Bar-
rett. Most Americans can see through 
this far-left hoax, but it is important 
to set the record right. Judge Barrett 
is not and has never advocated in favor 
of taking away anyone’s healthcare— 
period. 
Liberals have gone after Judge Bar-
rett for her views on abortion. First of 
all, Judge Barrett has every right to 
enjoy her religious freedom. I think we 
all understand that. I am saddened to 
see the attacks that she has received 
due to her Catholic faith. Nevertheless, 
her record shows that she will thought-
fully apply the Constitution to all 
cases while honoring Supreme Court 
precedent. At the same time, she has 
proven that she impartially and faith-
fully exercises her duties as an appel-
late judge. There is no reason to be-
lieve that she would not continue to do 
so as a Justice. 
Now I want to speak about the prece-
dent for acting on today’s vacancy, 
which differs from the vacancy of 2016. 
The Democrats and liberal media have 
called Senate Republicans hypocrites 
for opposing the confirmation of Presi-
dent Obama’s Supreme Court nominee 
in 2016 but supporting the confirmation 
of the President’s nominee today. What 
they fail to recognize is that we fol-
lowed Senate precedent. We followed it 
in 2016, and we are following it again 
right now. 
In 2016, we had a divided government. 
What a divided government means is 
that we have different parties control-
ling the White House and the con-
firming body, the U.S. Senate. In 2016, 
we had that divided government, and

October 25, 2020 
they were controlled by different par-
ties. The Senate Republicans followed 
the Biden rule then, which is that the 
Senate does not confirm an election 
year vacancy in which the White House 
and the Senate are controlled by dif-
ferent parties. Despite the Democrats’ 
insistence 
on 
confirming 
President 
Obama’s nominee, Senate Republicans 
followed precedent. 
The reality is that, in the modern 
era, the Senate has not confirmed a Su-
preme Court nominee under a divided 
government. It just hasn’t happened. 
The last time the Senate confirmed a 
nominee under these circumstances 
was in 1888. Today, we have a united 
government. The same party that has 
the Senate has the Presidency. The 
voters elected President Trump in 2016. 
The Senate Republicans grew their ma-
jority in 2018. In nearly every instance 
in history in which there has been a 
Supreme Court vacancy under a united 
government, we have voted to confirm. 
In fact, the only time in history that 
the Senate did not confirm a nominee 
under a united government was in 1968, 
wherein there was bipartisan opposi-
tion on ethical grounds. They all 
agreed that the nominee should be 
withdrawn, and he was withdrawn. 
It is simply false to state that Senate 
Republicans are going against prece-
dent. As a matter of political conven-
ience, the Democrats have flip-flopped 
from what they said in 2016 and are 
adamantly opposed to a vote during an 
election year. It is not surprising that 
the media has ignored their about-face. 
I am proud of the efforts by Leader 
MCCONNELL and our Republican major-
ity, who have confirmed dozens of 
President Trump’s exemplary judicial 
nominations. I think the number right 
now is somewhere around 212, and that 
may be a record, but those are a lot of 
nominations. 
Senate Republicans and President 
Trump have followed through on our 
promise to remake the judiciary with 
more judges who interpret the law as 
written, not legislate from the bench. 
We all know what we are talking about 
there. With Judge Barrett, we have the 
opportunity to confirm the President’s 
third Supreme Court nominee to the 
bench. 
Everyone knows Judge Barrett is 
hard-working, principled, and com-
mitted to serving her fellow Ameri-
cans. In a 2017 letter, a bipartisan 
group of law professors called her work 
‘‘rigorous, fair-minded, respectful, and 
constructive.’’ I couldn’t agree more. I 
know she will serve our highest Court 
with honor and distinction, and I look 
forward to voting to confirm the nomi-
nation soon. She is, I really think, the 
most gifted, talented jurist to be found 
in America today. 
My wife and I have been married for 
60 
years. 
We 
have 
20 
kids 
and 
grandkids. They are the ones who are 
going to be the beneficiaries of the 
service of Judge Barrett. She is going 
to be confirmed as an Associate Justice 
on our High Court in a matter of hours, 
and this is going to be a great thing for 
America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
HONORING DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT KEVIN 
COLLINS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, it is 
such an honor and such a pleasure to be 
with my fellow Senator from Arkansas, 
Mr. COTTON, as we rise to honor Pine 
Bluff Detective Kevin Collins, who died 
while in the line of duty, on Monday, 
October 5, as a result of injuries he sus-
tained. 
Detective Collins was a passionate 
person about law enforcement and 
serving the citizens of Pine Bluff. He 
served his community not only as an 
officer of the law but also as a mentor 
and a leader. 
It was reported that he had wanted to 
be a police officer since he had been 3 
years old. In an interview with the 
Pine Bluff Commercial in 2018, he said: 
‘‘Ever since I was little, I saw law en-
forcement as a service and something I 
could be proud of.’’ He worked his en-
tire life to achieve that dream, and it 
came true 5 years ago when he was 
hired by the Pine Bluff Police Depart-
ment on June 8, 2015. 
He was first assigned to the patrol di-
vision, and he worked his way up to the 
violent crimes unit. Detective Collins 
loved being a police officer, and he en-
joyed building relationships with the 
men and women he worked alongside as 
well as with the citizens whom he 
served. 
His colleagues appreciated his enthu-
siasm, his hard work, and dedication, 
which he demonstrated each and every 
day both in and out of uniform. 
Detective 
Collins 
was 
passionate 
about making a difference in the lives 
of others. As a mentor to at-risk boys 
during the department’s 2-week Youth 
Empowerment Camp, he was a role 
model for teens—encouraging good be-
havior and reinforcing the importance 
of making good decisions. 
In his short time with the Pine Bluff 
Police Department, he had a long list 
of successes that include taking a large 
number of guns off the streets and 
earning the department’s Officer of the 
Year for 2017 for his actions in saving a 
95-year-old resident while responding 
to an apartment fire. 
Detective Collins lived a faithful life 
devoted to Christ as a member of New 
Life Church Pine Bluff. 
Pastor Matt Mosler says Detective 
Collins had a great heart for service. 
He took that heart for service and put 
his faith into action, taking the initia-
tive to make his community better. 
We rely on law enforcement officers 
like Detective Collins to keep commu-
nities safe, to keep us safe. His death is 
a tragic reminder of the risk law en-
forcement officers face each day when 
they put on their uniform and leave 
the comforts of their homes and their 
loved ones to serve and to protect. 
Detective Collins was a true hero. 
Our hearts break for his family, his 
colleagues at the Pine Bluff Police De-
partment, and community members. I 
pray they will find comfort from the 
outpouring of support for this beloved 
brother in blue. 
Senator COTTON, I yield to you. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, the men 
and women of law enforcement in Ar-
kansas could have no greater champion 
in the U.S. Senate than JOHN BOOZMAN. 
It is always an honor to join him on 
the floor, but today is a sad and solemn 
honor to be here to commemorate the 
life of Detective Kevin Collins. 
Detective Collins of Pine Bluff had 
known since he was the young age of 3 
that he wanted to be a police officer. 
His step-dad worked for the Jefferson 
County Sheriff’s Department. His mom 
was a teacher. So from an early age, 
the role models in Kevin’s life inspired 
him to serve others, and serve he did, 
above and beyond the call of duty. 
For a time he worked as an emer-
gency services dispatcher. Then he 
worked for the Arkansas Department 
of Corrections. Five years ago, he real-
ized his childhood dream by joining his 
hometown police department to serve 
the community he knew and loved. 
Detective Collins was part of the vio-
lent crimes unit, which means he 
worked on some of Arkansas’ most 
dangerous cases. He had a special pas-
sion for taking illegal guns off the 
streets and mentoring young people in 
the community. 
His hard work was noticed and re-
warded. Just 2 years after joining the 
force, Detective Collins was named Of-
ficer of the Year after rushing into a 
burning apartment building and res-
cuing a 95-year-old woman trapped in-
side. 
When he received that award, Detec-
tive Collins reflected on his lifelong 
dream of becoming a police officer, 
which he described as a ‘‘service’’ and 
something ‘‘I could be proud of.’’ 
You could say that Kevin Collins was 
destined to be a police officer. Trag-
ically, he was also destined to die as 
one, much too soon. 
Earlier this month, Detective Collins 
was tracking a suspected murderer who 
was holed up in a hotel. A gun battle 
broke out. Detective Collins and his 
fellow officer, Lieutenant Ralph Isaac, 
were hit during this exchange and 
rushed to the hospital. Lieutenant 
Isaac has begun to recover, but, sadly, 
Detective Collins did not. He went 
home to be with the Lord at the age of 
35, leaving his family, his community, 
and our State heartbroken over the 
loss. 
Detective Collins’ death is a tragedy 
and a stark warning and reminder of 
the dangers police officers face every 
day. 
Detective Collins joins 231 of his fel-
low officers who have died in the line of 
duty in America just this year, but it 
would be a mistake only to mark De-
tective Collins’ death. We ought also to 
learn from his example in life. 
Kevin Collins was a guardian of Pine 
Bluff, whether in his capacity as an of-
ficer or off duty as a security guard at 
his local church.

S6467 
October 25, 2020 
When he received the Officer of the 
Year Award in 2017, Detective Collins 
said that being a police officer was 
about extending a ‘‘life line to save 
others.’’ We will never know how many 
lives Kevin Collins saved, but we do 
know that his hometown is now safer 
and more peaceful because of his years 
of service. 
Pine Bluff was blessed to have a 
guardian the likes of Kevin Collins. 
Now his watch on Earth is over. He is 
looking down on us from above. May he 
rest in peace. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate 
will confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
to the Supreme Court, filling the seat 
vacated by the late Justice Ginsburg 
with a very worthy successor. 
When President Trump nominated 
Judge Barrett last month, some Ameri-
cans questioned whether the Senate 
should confirm any nominee to the Su-
preme Court. But today, just weeks 
later, a clear majority of Americans 
support confirmation, including a ma-
jority of Independents. 
What happened? It is very simple. 
Americans met Judge Barrett; they 
loved what they saw; and they decided 
she is the right woman for this job. 
Consider her achievements. She grad-
uated No. 1 in her class from Notre 
Dame Law School, where she also edit-
ed the law review and later clerked for 
two giants of our judiciary—Judge Sil-
berman of the DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals and the late, great Justice Scalia. 
Years later, Judge Barrett returned 
to her alma mater as a professor, where 
she won the esteem of her students and 
colleagues as a gifted teacher and an 
‘‘absolutely brilliant legal scholar,’’ to 
quote the dean of Notre Dame Law. 
Then, in 2017, the Senate confirmed 
Professor Barrett to be Judge Barrett 
on the Seventh Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. In the 3 years since then, she has 
established herself as one of America’s 
finest 
judges—unwaveringly 
com-
mitted to the rule of law and equality 
before the law. 
A Scalia protege, beloved professor, 
respected 
jurist—those 
titles 
alone 
warrant Amy Coney Barrett’s con-
firmation to the Supreme Court, but 
they are not her only achievements or 
even the most important ones. 
In addition to those things, she has a 
big and beautiful family, with a de-
voted husband and seven kids, includ-
ing two adopted from Haiti. They are a 
family knitted together by love and 
faith. 
Any parent knows how difficult it 
must be for Judge Barrett to juggle the 
demands of her work with her duties as 
a parent and a wife. But like millions 
of working moms, she manages to do 
both with incredible skill, grace, and 
poise. 
I suspect I must confess that if Judge 
Barrett had been nominated by a Presi-
dent without an ‘‘R’’ behind his name, 
the media would laud her as a pioneer, 
an inspiration to young women all 
across the country. Today’s newspapers 
would contain front page stories of 
gushing profiles, studded with words 
like ‘‘iconic’’ and ‘‘pathbreaking.’’ The 
media would practically carry her from 
the Judiciary Committee to this floor 
so we could vote to confirm her, and 
then they would carry her across the 
street to her Supreme Court chambers. 
But, curiously, I have noticed that is 
not what the media is doing—not in 
the least. Instead, the liberal media 
has published lurid insinuations and 
expose´s about everything from Judge 
Barrett’s character to her Christian 
faith and even her adopted children. It 
is the Brett Kavanaugh playbook all 
over again. 
But, thankfully, the American people 
see through it, just as they did the last 
time. For the most part, Democrats on 
the Judiciary Committee avoided these 
kinds of low, personal attacks. Perhaps 
they have seen the polling so they 
know they are playing a very weak 
hand. 
Instead, they focused on the supposed 
threat that Judge Barrett will over-
turn ObamaCare and take away your 
healthcare. In fact, they focused on 
ObamaCare so much during Judge 
Barrett’s confirmation hearing, when I 
turned on the TV, I thought I had I 
tuned in to the Health Committee, not 
the Judiciary Committee. 
But Democrats’ attacks on this pol-
icy fall just as flat as the media’s 
shameful stories on Judge Barrett’s 
character for the simple reason that 
Judge Barrett, as a judge, does not 
make policy. She is not a Senator. She 
is not standing for elective office. I sus-
pect she wouldn’t want to. 
Her role as a judge is to interpret and 
apply the law fairly and faithfully, 
without regard to her own beliefs and 
convictions. 
Now, that may be a novel concept for 
our Democratic friends who view the 
judiciary as simply another means to 
advance their leftwing agenda, irre-
spective of the law and facts, but it is 
central to Judge Barrett’s record on 
the court of appeals and her judicial 
philosophy. Her opinions bear that out, 
and she has applied the law consist-
ently without fear or favor on the Fed-
eral Bench, and, I suspect, reached a 
few outcomes on a personal level that 
she would have preferred not to, which 
was always Justice Scalia’s gold stand-
ard for an impartial and fair judge. 
That leaves the Democrats with one 
final argument—nothing more than a 
process argument. 
They say that the Republicans are 
moving too quickly; that we are some-
how ramming Judge Barrett through 
the Senate, possibly, to prevent an ade-
quate examination of her record. But, 
of course, this argument fails too. It 
fails badly. 
Judge Barrett’s nomination has pro-
ceeded at a pace in line with other re-
cent nominations. 
Exactly 30 days ago she was nomi-
nated, and tomorrow she will be con-
firmed. That is 11 more days than the 
Senate deliberated on the nomination 
of Justice John Paul Stevens, who was 
confirmed after just 19 days. It is only 
12 fewer days than the Senate delib-
erated on the nomination of Justice 
Ginsburg herself. And I would note 
that we went through this with Judge 
Barrett barely 3 years ago. It had been 
5 years for then-Judge Stevens. It had 
been 13 years for then-Judge Ginsburg. 
There is not a lot of material for this 
Senate to have reviewed; less than 3 
years of activities by Judge Barrett, 
fewer than 100 opinions—even a Sen-
ator can probably get through those in 
a couple days. 
Yet the Democrats have repeatedly 
asked for delay after delay, though 
they haven’t identified any area in 
which they lacked adequate time to re-
view her nomination. They haven’t 
identified any bit of information that 
they don’t already have. In fact, some 
of 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
an-
nounced their opposition to her nomi-
nation—or any nominee, for that mat-
ter—before she was even announced as 
the nominee. 
So what do they want more time for, 
exactly, except to stall? 
Indeed, far from being rushed, Judge 
Barrett’s 
nomination 
doesn’t 
come 
close to setting the record for speed. 
That distinction belongs to Justice 
James Byrnes, who was nominated to 
the Supreme Court in 1941 by President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt and con-
firmed later that day. I guess we could 
have taken a page from the Democrats’ 
playbook by confirming Judge Barrett 
last month on the day she was nomi-
nated, but instead we took the same 
careful, consistent, deliberative ap-
proach that we took with Justice 
Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch—no 
shortcuts, no corners cut, no steps 
skipped. 
So, finally, here we are on the cusp of 
Judge Barrett’s confirmation. As a re-
sult, the Democrats are threatening to 
pack the Court, but they were already 
threatening to pack the Court. 
The 
Democrats 
are 
threatening, 
should we confirm Judge Barrett to the 
Supreme Court, to riot in the streets. 
Democrats have been rioting in the 
streets for months. But as the sun sets 
tomorrow, the Senate will gather, and 
all of that bluster will once again prove 
ineffective because Judge Barrett has 
earned the trust and confidence of the 
American people and the U.S. Senate. 
For that reason, Judge Barrett will be 
confirmed tomorrow night. 
I congratulate Judge Barrett on this 
high honor, and I thank her family— 
her beloved husband Jesse and her 
seven beautiful children—for sharing 
her with America. For those seven kids 
especially: I know that she will always 
be mom to you, but I trust you won’t 
object if we know her as Justice. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6468 
October 25, 2020 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). Without objection, 
it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, we 
are in session here on a Sunday in 
Washington for a rare Sunday session 
in the U.S. Senate so that we can con-
firm a terrific woman to be the next 
Justice of the Supreme Court. 
There is an open seat right now that 
needs to be filled, and Judge Barrett, 
who is currently a judge on the circuit 
court, one level below the Supreme 
Court, has really impressed me and the 
American people with her performance. 
I had a chance to meet with her this 
past week, and I was already impressed 
but even more so, having had a chance 
to spend some time with her. I had 
been impressed with her performance 
at the hearing because I thought she 
showed great patience and calm in the 
face of some really tough questions. To 
me, that is judicial temperament, and I 
think that will serve her well in her 
new role as Justice of the Supreme 
Court. 
I have also been impressed with her 
qualifications. I don’t think anybody 
can say she is not highly qualified. In 
fact, the American Bar Association, 
which does not always look favorably 
at Republican appointees, was, in her 
last confirmation, convinced that she 
was highly qualified, and again, in this 
one, they gave her their highest quali-
fication. That is impressive. 
As has been talked about on the floor 
tonight, she actually has been through 
this process before—and pretty re-
cently. I think less than 3 years ago 
she was confirmed by this same body, 
and it was a bipartisan vote, and it was 
an opportunity for people to get to 
know her. So this is not as though we 
have brought somebody forward who 
isn’t already known, who isn’t already 
deemed to be very well qualified. In 
fact, I don’t know anybody in this 
Chamber who doesn’t think that she is 
well qualified and that she has done a 
good job as a judge and a lawyer. 
She graduated first in her class at 
Notre Dame Law School, and then she 
went back there and taught. She won 
the Teacher of the Year Award three 
times when she was at Notre Dame, 
and, most importantly to me, she is 
just widely respected by her colleagues. 
These are professors. She is also widely 
respected 
by 
her 
former 
students. 
These professors and students, by the 
way, are representing the entire polit-
ical spectrum from very liberal to very 
conservative. All of them say the same 
thing about her, which is that she is a 
legal scholar, that she is highly quali-
fied, and that she is a good person. 
In our meeting I got to see some of 
that. I saw in our meeting that she is 
a great listener. People talk about ac-
tive listening. She was really inter-
ested in what the topics were and had 
very thoughtful responses. 
She is also a legal scholar who under-
stands very clearly what the role of the 
Supreme Court should be in our separa-
tion of branches in our governmental 
system here. I think that is really im-
portant. As I said to her in our meet-
ing, I hope she will be an ambassador, 
and I think she will. In fact, I think 
she will be an extremely effective am-
bassador—as the youngest member of 
the Supreme Court and also as a 
former teacher—with regard to young 
people, to help them understand what 
it means to have a judicial branch and 
how it is different from the legislative 
branch or the executive branch for that 
matter. Judges are not supposed to be 
legislators. That is not what they are 
hired to do. Yet in some cases we have 
gotten the sense that judges ought to 
be deciding issues that are reserved for 
those who are elected by the people; 
that is, the legislators. 
Judges have an important role, and 
that is to look at the laws and to look 
at the Constitution and to determine 
whether something is consistent with 
those. That is what she will do, and I 
think she will do it very fairly, with 
compassion and with a great under-
standing of the legal issues and prece-
dent. 
She explained before the committee 
that she was respectful of precedent. 
She also told me that in our meeting. 
I think she has the proper under-
standing of the role of the Court and 
her role as a Justice. 
I am looking for the opportunity to 
finally vote. I guess we will do that to-
morrow 
night, 
sometime 
in 
the 
evening, and I hope it will be a strong 
vote. I hope it can be even a bipartisan 
vote, as it was last time she was con-
firmed by this same body. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, while the Senate con-
tinues to work through this important 
process of the next Supreme Court 
nominee, I am also here on the floor 
today to remind all of us that we are 
still in the middle of an unprecedented 
healthcare and economic crisis caused 
by this ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
I am here to express my frustration 
that the sense of urgency and com-
promise that we had for the first sev-
eral months of this coronavirus seem 
to have disappeared as we have ap-
proached the election. 
The Democratic leader today raised 
the seriousness of the pandemic. Some-
thing said on the other side of the aisle 
was that we shouldn’t even be taking 
up a Supreme Court nominee because 
of the seriousness of the pandemic and 
the need to focus on that. 
I don’t understand why then, on 
Wednesday, the same Democratic lead-
er and his colleagues blocked even tak-
ing action on the coronavirus or even 
having a debate on whether to take ac-
tion because, once again, they blocked 
a legislative initiative to have a dis-
cussion about this issue. 
By the way, it is a discussion about 
an issue that affects every single one of 
our States. Again, we are not out of the 
woods, so we should be not just dis-
cussing it but passing legislation on it. 
The legislation that we have intro-
duced might not be legislation that 
every Democrat can support. In fact, I 
think there were some things that were 
in our bill that some Democrats might 
not love. But for the most part, there 
were bipartisan proposals that every-
body can support, and all we asked for 
was to be able to get on the bill to have 
a debate. Yet we had to have 60 votes 
to be able to do that. That is the super-
majority that is required around here, 
and those 60 votes could not be found, 
even though last Wednesday the $500 
billion package got a majority vote. 
There was a majority vote for this 
package but not the supermajority 
needed. It was blocked by the other 
side. 
If we had gotten on the legislation 
and had the debate about what the PPP 
program ought to look like, how much 
money should be used for testing, what 
we should do with regard to liability 
protections, Democrats would have had 
the opportunity to put their own ideas 
forward, to offer their own amend-
ments, and I would have strongly sup-
ported them in that process. 
Also, some of us had some additional 
amendments we would like to have 
added and changes we would like to 
have seen. But, ultimately, if Demo-
crats or Republicans found that they 
didn’t like the final product that came 
out of that discussion, that debate, 
they would have had another chance 
because there would have been another 
60-vote hurdle to get over before pas-
sage of the legislation. 
I know this is sounding like a process 
issue, but it really is not. It is about 
doing our jobs as Senators. Both Re-
publicans and Democrats care about 
this issue, yet we just can’t seem to 
figure out how to get it unfrozen here 
and to be able to move forward. Having 
blocked, again, even having a debate on 
moving forward was very discouraging 
to me. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, the economy is still 
struggling. As I said, we are not out of 
the woods yet, particularly in the areas 
of hospitality, travel, and entertain-
ment. We are not out of the woods on 
the virus yet, either, with many States 
seeing a third wave right now. That is 
what I would describe is happening in 
Ohio, my home State. I have watched 
the numbers every single day this 
week. Not only are the number of cases 
increasing, but the hospitalizations 
went up this week. The number of peo-
ple in ICU went up and fatalities went 
up. 
It is critical that this Congress pro-
vide additional relief to help the Amer-
ican people get through this healthcare 
crisis and economic fallout we have 
seen. We have done it before. Five 
times Republicans and Democrats on 
this floor and over in the House and 
working with the White House have 
passed 
coronavirus 
legislation—five 
times. In fact, most of the votes have 
been unanimous. It is unbelievable be-
cause here we are in this partisan at-
mosphere, but most of the votes have 
been unanimous.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6469 
October 25, 2020 
These laws have helped address both 
the healthcare crisis and the economic 
free fall that were caused by the virus 
and 
the 
government-imposed 
shut-
downs. And for some of my colleagues 
who are concerned about the cost, I 
would just say again—government-im-
posed shutdowns. Many of these busi-
nesses in my home State that are 
struggling, you know, they were told to 
shut down, and they do need our help. 
They deserve our help. The same gov-
ernment that insisted that they not be 
in business ought to help them now to 
get back in business and stay in busi-
ness. 
The biggest of these bills that this 
body and the House and the White 
House worked hard on and passed is 
called the CARES Act. A lot of people 
have heard about it. It is a piece of leg-
islation that was very important at the 
time but needs to be extended, in es-
sence, now. It was passed by a vote in 
this Chamber of 96 to nothing. 
Unfortunately, since May of this 
year, when the last of these bipartisan 
bills was enacted, partisanship has pre-
vailed over good policy, and Wash-
ington has been paralyzed, unable to 
repeat the coming together for the 
good of all of us. 
For months, Democrats insisted that 
the only way forward was a bill called 
the $3.5 trillion Heroes Act, which 
passed the House of Representatives 4 
months ago along partisan lines. It in-
cluded things unrelated to COVID–19, 
and you can argue about those things. 
The SALT—the State and local tax de-
duction—is in there, as an example. 
That has nothing to do with COVID–19. 
It is a tax break, frankly, for wealthier 
individuals. Most of that tax break 
would go to people who are wealthy, 
and about half of it goes to people in 
the top 1 percent. There are immigra-
tion law changes in that legislation 
that are very controversial. Should we 
have a debate separately? Of course, 
but not in a COVID–19 bill. There are 
other policies in terms of election law 
and how States would handle their 
elections that had nothing to do with 
COVID–19. 
Also, it was $3.5 trillion. Now, we are 
facing this year not just the largest 
deficit in the history of our country 
but also a debt as a percentage of the 
economy, which is how most econo-
mists look at our fiscal problems— 
what is the debt as a percentage of the 
economy? It is as high as it has ever 
been, with the possible exception of 
World War II—a year when we had huge 
military 
expenditures, 
but 
pretty 
quickly the economy grew, and we 
didn’t have this big overhang of the en-
titlement spending that already has us 
in a structural debt. 
So $3.5 trillion is a lot of money. 
When it passed the House, it was the 
most expensive legislation ever to pass 
the House of Representatives by far. 
When it did pass, by the way, POLIT-
ICO and others in the media accurately 
called it a messaging bill that they 
thought had no chance of becoming 
law. There is a good reason for that— 
$3.5 trillion and, again, the items there 
that did not relate to the coronavirus 
crisis. 
Since that time, Senate Republicans 
have provided some reasonable alter-
natives to this partisan proposal with 
targeted coronavirus response legisla-
tion—bills that help us directly address 
the healthcare and the economic crisis 
by investing in bipartisan approaches 
that we know work. 
The last legislation that was offered 
here on Wednesday was about $500 bil-
lion. That used to be a lot of money. 
Again, Democrats probably objected to 
some specific elements of it, like liabil-
ity protection, but we should have had 
the opportunity to debate that and 
have a discussion. But on Wednesday, 
Democrats blocked it. 
Their position has been very clear, as 
I see it. They are going to stick with 
Speaker PELOSI no matter what, and I 
understand that from a negotiating po-
sition. They think she is the one nego-
tiating with the White House; there-
fore, they are not going to get in-
volved. I have talked to some of my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who have expressed the same frustra-
tion I am expressing right now. Gosh, 
why can’t we get together between Re-
publicans and Democrats and support 
something that is a compromise? But I 
think they have been told by their 
leadership: No discussion; no debate; 
we are going to stick with whatever 
the Speaker wants. 
Again, coming up to the election, it 
is my sense that what the Speaker 
wants is not to have a result. That is 
my sense. You have heard the Presi-
dent say very clearly he is willing to 
spend even more than the Speaker 
wants to spend. I am not suggesting 
that is the position that every Senate 
Republican has because many believe 
we spent a lot of money and we need to 
be very careful and be much more tar-
geted given the fiscal situation we 
talked about earlier. 
Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the 
Treasury, has been very interested in 
getting a result and has, in good faith, 
been negotiating. But, again, we have 
not been able to make any progress be-
cause the notion is that we are going 
to stick with the Speaker’s position no 
matter what. So instead of a com-
promise, we have zero relief. Instead of 
$3.5 trillion or $2.4 trillion—whatever 
the number is and whatever the Repub-
lican number is—we have zero relief 
that has been provided in the last sev-
eral months. There has been sort of an 
all-or-none attitude—either we do it 
her way, or we get nothing. 
Three separate times on this floor, 
Democrats have even blocked proposals 
to temporarily extend the Federal un-
employment 
insurance 
supplement 
that expired in August so that folks 
who were relying on that money could 
continue to make ends meet while we 
negotiated a long-term solution. This 
week, they blocked a reasonable ap-
proach on unemployment insurance, I 
believe. It was $300 per week Federal 
supplement on top of the State unem-
ployment, and they blocked it, saying 
that wasn’t enough and we need to 
stick with $600. So, again, it is either 
$600 or nothing. 
I will say that the $600 benefit is 
pretty generous. The Congressional 
Budget Office has told us that 80 per-
cent of the people who are on unem-
ployment insurance going forward—if 
we continued $600, 80 percent would be 
making more on unemployment insur-
ance than they would be making at 
work. Talk to your businesses back 
home, and what they will tell you is 
that this has been a problem in getting 
people back to work when they can 
make more—sometimes significantly 
more—on unemployment insurance. 
But how about $300? How about a 
compromise? Some people will make 
more. In fact, a lot of people will make 
more on unemployment insurance than 
they do at work at $300 but not 80 per-
cent of the people. Some will make 
more; some will make less. 
Last week, I finally thought we had a 
breaking point because the Speaker of 
the House had Members of her own cau-
cus calling her to work with the White 
House to pass at that time what was a 
$1.8 trillion package, but my under-
standing is, that wasn’t good enough. 
Let’s get back to the commonsense 
ideas we can all agree on. By the way, 
many of these are in this targeted leg-
islation that the majority of Senators 
voted on this past week, on Wednes-
day—again, a majority but not the 
supermajority needed to get it passed. 
First is on the healthcare response, 
particularly on testing, and in Ohio, we 
need it right now. We need more money 
for testing. Republicans and Democrats 
alike know that is critical to stopping 
the spread of the disease and getting 
people more comfortable going back to 
work, going back to school, and going 
back to their local businesses to buy 
things. We need the Federal help on 
testing. 
We also need help to continue invest-
ing in developing treatments, and, of 
course, we need to invest in a vaccine 
to get a vaccine as quickly as possible. 
The targeted bill that came to the 
House this past week did just that— 
provided $16 billion for increased test-
ing and contact tracing and an addi-
tional $31 billion for vaccine develop-
ment. That is the kind of support we 
need right now. 
Second, we agreed that Congress 
shouldn’t continue to have this situa-
tion where small businesses are being 
forced to close their doors. We all want 
to help small businesses. That was in 
the targeted bill also. 
One way we have agreed across the 
aisle is to have this PPP program—the 
paycheck protection program—be in ef-
fect, and the targeted legislation did 
just that. It restarted the Paycheck 
Protection Program, which was in-
cluded in the CARES Act but expired 
on August 8. So since August 8, we 
haven’t had it. This was a smart pro-
gram that provided low-interest loans

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

October 25, 2020 
to small businesses—loans that effec-
tively became grants if they used them 
for certain purposes, like payroll to 
keep people employed but also their 
rent and their mortgages and utilities. 
At least 140,000 Ohio businesses in my 
State 
of 
Ohio—140,000 
businesses— 
small businesses, have benefited from 
the PPP, saving what we think are at 
least 1.9 million jobs. Wow. We all 
know we need to extend that program. 
I think everybody agrees on that. I 
don’t know a Senator in this Chamber, 
Republican or Democrat, who hasn’t 
had the experience back home of a 
small business saying: I couldn’t have 
stayed open without this. I have had 
that conversation dozens of times. A 
lot of these businesses were able to use 
this PPP loan to weather the storm. 
Some have seen their businesses now 
pick back up, and they are hiring 
again, and that is great. 
I recently had a virtual roundtable 
with manufacturers all over Northeast 
Ohio—the 
Cleveland 
area 
and 
the 
Akron area. They were hit hard by the 
early shutdowns. They put their busi-
nesses at risk, but thanks to the PPP 
loans they received, they were able to 
keep their employees on payroll and 
keep the doors open. Do you know what 
most of them did? They did something 
related to helping. Some made ventila-
tors. Some made masks. Some made 
gowns. So they were able, during this 
slow time, to actually help to push 
back against the coronavirus. Now 
they are back in business. Now they 
are able to employ people, to hire peo-
ple, and to pay taxes and provide rev-
enue to the government. That is what 
we want. 
There are others, however, who des-
perately need continued PPP just to 
stay in business. I mentioned the hos-
pitality industry earlier, the entertain-
ment business, and the travel business. 
They have to have the PPP loans 
now—now—or they may close. Some 
have already closed because the pro-
gram has been shut down since August 
8 because we can’t seem to get our act 
together to provide the help. That was 
in the targeted bill. 
By the way, it makes PPP more tar-
geted and more focused because we 
don’t want to waste money; we want to 
focus it on companies that really need 
it. That is bipartisan also. Let’s do it. 
Beyond PPP, Congress should help 
invest in businesses to reopen safely 
and effectively. Small business owners 
I have spoken to during this pandemic 
and especially in recent weeks have 
told me that they are eager to reopen 
but they want to open in a safe man-
ner. That is the sweet spot here. We 
don’t want to close down the economy, 
but we do want the economy to be re-
opened and stay open safely. 
There are examples of how we can do 
that that this Congress should pass on 
a bipartisan basis. One is an expanded 
tax credit to incentivize new hiring 
through the work opportunity tax 
credit and the employee retention tax 
credit. We also have a new tax credit 
called the healthy workplace tax cred-
it. It is very simple. It helps businesses 
pay for protective equipment like 
plexiglass, hand sanitizer, and face cov-
erings. These are credits against pay-
roll tax that will help businesses rehire 
workers, reopen safely, and take these 
critical steps to let our economy re-
cover. 
I will continue to push this in every 
coronavirus package. You know what, 
it has total bipartisan appeal because 
it is exactly what we ought to be 
doing—reopening, yes, but doing it 
safely. Let’s give businesses the incen-
tives to do that. 
It is expensive to purchase PPE, par-
ticularly when you have tight reve-
nues, which a lot of businesses do right 
now. They want the help to be able to 
do it and do it right. 
Third, of course, we agree we need to 
invest in our schools and our State and 
local governments. With colleges and 
K–12 education trying to reopen around 
the country, it is critical that students 
don’t lose any more progress in the 
classroom. We need to make sure 
schools have these resources to reopen 
and to stay open with adequate protec-
tive gear and social distancing policies 
and, again, plexiglass and other things 
to make it safe. 
The $105 billion that was in this leg-
islation on Wednesday that was voted 
down—$105 billion for ensuring that 
schools are safe—is actually more than 
was in the original House-passed He-
roes Act. So, let’s find a compromise 
here, but you can’t say that helping 
the schools is a reason to vote no. 
State and local governments need 
support and more flexibility too. Ohio 
cities have been hit particularly hard 
because they rely on revenue from in-
come taxes more than other cities 
around the country, and that income 
tax revenue has been lower than any of 
their projections. 
The targeted bill would have helped 
by extending the timeline in which 
CARES funding could be spent beyond 
the end of this year. I have heard this 
repeatedly from our Governor in Ohio, 
Mike DeWine, and also from local offi-
cials in Ohio: Don’t make us spend all 
the money by yearend. We can spend it 
more effectively if you give us some 
flexibility on that. 
None of us should want to do that. 
We always complain about the Federal 
rule where you are telling an agency 
‘‘You have to spend the money by year-
end; use it or lose it’’ because it en-
courages them to go ahead and spend 
it, even though they don’t need to, so 
they can have the same budget next 
year. Let’s let them have the flexi-
bility to spend the money as they need 
it. 
We all know now that this virus isn’t 
going away in calendar year 2020. It is 
going to be around in 2021. Let’s give 
them that flexibility. 
With this extended timeline, we 
should also provide flexibility so they 
can be certain that they can spend the 
money where they need it, including 
for public safety—police, fire, EMS. 
Fourth, we all agree we have to make 
sure Americans have adequate access 
to telehealth and telehealth medicine. 
Most of us in this Chamber have prob-
ably utilized telehealth services during 
this pandemic, and we know that they 
work. 
Telehealth has been a lifeline for mil-
lions of Americans, particularly for 
those fighting addiction, for those who 
have behavioral health issues, mental 
health issues, who can’t currently re-
ceive in-person care to help in their re-
covery. 
I have worked with the Trump ad-
ministration to expand telehealth and 
delivery options for opioid treatment, 
which, in some instances, has even al-
lowed addiction specialists to reach 
new patients. I love hearing that—that 
in this dark cloud, one silver lining is 
that telehealth has actually been suc-
cessful and helped people, including 
mental 
health 
providers 
and 
drug 
treatment providers, to reach new peo-
ple whom they couldn’t reach pre-
viously. 
However, the reforms that we have in 
place now, based on the previous legis-
lation I talked about, are only tem-
porary. The bipartisan legislation we 
have introduced, along with my col-
league SHELDON
WHITEHOUSE, is to 
make these telehealth options perma-
nent. It is called the TREATS Act. 
That should be in any coronavirus 
package, and it would be. 
Finally, we need to chart a path for-
ward on the issue of expanded unem-
ployment insurance. Unemployment is 
down from the highest we saw in the 
spring, and it has been very encour-
aging to see how many new jobs have 
come back. It exceeded all expecta-
tions, everybody’s—OMB’s, CBO’s, out-
side projections. 
But unemployment is still way too 
high. We are still at 8.9 percent in 
Ohio, and it is probably about 8 percent 
nationally. Think of this. We went 
from the lowest unemployment we 
have seen in decades just before this 
virus, more like 3.5 percent—record 
lows for Blacks, Hispanics, disabled, 
women—and now we have about 8 per-
cent unemployment—more than double 
that. 
I said earlier that Congress allowed 
the original unemployment insurance 
supplement to expire without a re-
placement. When that happened, the 
Trump administration stepped in and 
used $44 billion from FEMA’s Disaster 
Relief Fund, which had received fund-
ing from the CARES Act to tempo-
rarily add a $300-per-week Federal sup-
plement called the Lost Wage Assist-
ance Program. This program funded 6 
weeks of expanded unemployment in-
surance and also encouraged States to 
provide their own match. 
What happened was that every State 
but two took the government up on 
that. They didn’t add their match, but 
they did take the 300 bucks, and a lot 
of people who had lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own were able 
to be helped through this Executive ac-
tion.

October 25, 2020 
Unfortunately, we are now at a point 
where this program has been tapped 
out. Why? Because the $44 billion that 
was set aside in the Disaster Relief 
Fund is gone, leaving $25 billion to deal 
with natural disasters, which is what 
the Disaster Relief Fund is intended to 
do. And they need that money. We 
shouldn’t use any more of that. So we 
are back to square one. 
People who have had unemployment 
insurance since the disaster began be-
cause they might work in hospitality, 
entertainment, travel, some businesses 
where they can’t go back—a lot of 
those folks now are seeing just a State 
benefit or no benefit. 
The Republican proposal actually 
had a long-term solution by providing 
$300 per week through December 27— 
basically, through the end of the year. 
That was in the package that was just 
voted down. So Democrats, who say 
they want $600, voted down $300 be-
cause it wasn’t enough. Well, somebody 
who is on unemployment is probably 
wondering: Why not just compromise 
and at least get me the $300 so that I 
can pay my rent, I can pay my car pay-
ment, I can make ends meet, even 
though I can’t go back to my job? 
So if nothing else comes out of these 
coronavirus negotiations, let’s at least 
provide more funding for the Disaster 
Relief Fund so that we can continue to 
respond at the executive branch level. 
If Congress can’t get its act together, 
at least continue the $300 through the 
way the administration was doing it 
for 6 weeks. We have proposed legisla-
tion to do just that, replenishing the 
Disaster Relief Fund so that this vital 
unemployment insurance supplement 
can continue that the administration 
had in place. 
If we can’t pass a bigger package, 
why can’t we just pass that? Why can’t 
we just pass PPP? Why can’t we just 
pass something for testing? Why can’t 
we just pass something to ensure that 
we are helping right now during this 
crisis? 
The bottom line is that there is still 
a lot for Congress to do to help lead the 
country through this coronavirus crisis 
we find ourselves in. Between bol-
stering our healthcare response, pro-
moting a stronger and more equitable 
economic recovery, getting the nec-
essary funding to our schools, pro-
viding that flexibility I talked about 
earlier to governments, ensuring that 
our constituents can make ends meet 
as they deal with sudden unemploy-
ment and other challenges, we have a 
lot of opportunities to help our country 
weather the storm of this pandemic. 
I hope things will change soon. 
Maybe it will change on the election. 
Maybe after the election there will be a 
different attitude. I hope so. I hope 
that at least in the lameduck session of 
Congress, if we can’t get our act to-
gether this week, we can figure out 
how to recapture that spirit of biparti-
sanship we saw this spring, to nego-
tiate in good faith, come to an agree-
ment—and fast. Our constituents need 
it. Let’s get it done. 
I yield back my time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon to share with you and 
our colleagues some of my thoughts 
concerning the nomination of Judge 
Amy Coney Barrett to serve as an As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of 
these United States. 
I believe it was Winston Churchill 
who once said these words: ‘‘The fur-
ther back we look, the further forward 
we see.’’ So let me begin today by look-
ing back in time—way back in time. 
More than 230 years ago, during the 
Constitutional Convention in Philadel-
phia, just up the road from my family’s 
home in Wilmington, DE, our Founders 
debated at great length on how to cre-
ate a different kind of government—an 
experiment, if you will, in which a na-
tion’s citizens would elect their own 
leaders, and a system of checks and 
balances would ensure that country 
would never—never—be led by a ty-
rant. 
Among the most contentious issues 
they debated during that summer of 
1787 in the City of Brotherly Love was 
the creation of a Federal judiciary. Our 
Founders disagreed, oftentimes strong-
ly, about what our judicial system 
should look like and how judges should 
be 
selected: 
Who 
would 
nominate 
them? Who would confirm them? Would 
they serve one term, multiple terms, or 
would their appointments be lifetime 
in nature? 
When the Framers appeared to be 
hopelessly deadlocked, members of the 
clergy were brought in to pray that 
God would provide the leaders with the 
wisdom to break the impasse. 
In the end, it apparently worked, and 
our 
Founding 
Founders 
ended 
up 
adopting a compromise very similar to 
one they had rejected just a few weeks 
earlier; namely, the President would 
nominate judges to serve lifetime ap-
pointments with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate. 
Not surprisingly, almost 240 years 
later, we are still sparring over what 
those words should mean. 
Having said that, the blueprint that 
was drafted that year and later ratified 
by the 13 States would go on to become 
the most enduring and replicated Con-
stitution in the history of the world. 
Among our most important sworn 
duties here in the U.S. Senate is to act 
as caretakers of that Constitution and 
the rights it provides for our citizens 
while protecting this unique system of 
checks and balances that provide the 
foundation on which our democracy is 
built. 
That brings us to the present. This 
past week, Republican Members of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee voted to 
advance Judge Barrett’s nomination to 
the floor of the Senate, but they have 
done so, I fear, at great cost to this 
body and quite possibly to our democ-
racy. 
When our Founders carefully de-
signed our system of checks and bal-
ances, they did not envision a sham 
confirmation process for judicial nomi-
nees. But as much as I hate to say it, 
that is what this one has been, pure 
and simple. This entire process has be-
come an exercise in raw political 
power, 
not 
the 
deliberative, 
non-
partisan process that our Founders en-
visioned. 
Frankly, it has been a process that I 
could never have imagined 20 years ago 
when I was first elected to serve with 
my colleagues here. Over those 20 
years, I have risen on six previous oc-
casions to offer remarks regarding 
nominees to the Supreme Court as we 
considered the nominations of Chief 
Justice Roberts, Justice Alito, Justice 
Sotomayor, 
Justice 
Kagan, 
Justice 
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh. 
One name not mentioned among the 
six I have just listed is that of Judge 
Merrick Garland. After being nomi-
nated by President Clinton to serve on 
the DC Circuit Court of Appeals—that 
is the top appellate court in the coun-
try—and confirmed by a Republican-led 
Senate with a bipartisan margin of 
more than 3 to 1—76 to 23, in fact— 
Judge Garland has served with distinc-
tion on our top appellate court since 
1997, including for many years as its 
chief judge. 
President Obama later nominated 
him to serve on the Supreme Court 237 
days before election day in 2016—237 
days before election day. 
By submitting the name of Judge 
Garland to the U.S. Senate for consid-
eration 4 years ago, President Obama, 
who was twice elected by clear margins 
in both the popular vote and the elec-
toral college, nominated a man who 
spent his entire 20-year career as a 
judge working to build consensus and 
find principled compromises. Yet we 
never got a chance to consider Judge 
Garland’s nomination to serve on the 
Supreme Court on this Senate floor. 
Judge Garland wasn’t given a vote ei-
ther in committee or here in the U.S. 
Senate. Judge Garland wasn’t given a 
hearing. Most of our Republican col-
leagues wouldn’t even meet with him, 
even though many of them had voted 
earlier to confirm him to, again, serve 
on the top appellate Court of our land. 
Judge 
Garland’s 
nomination 
lan-
guished for 293 shameful days. A great 
many Americans believe that it is the 
equivalent of stealing a Supreme Court 
seat. A good man—a very good man— 
was treated badly and so, too, was our 
Constitution. 
Still, many of our Republican col-
leagues assured us that if the tables 
were turned later on, they would hold 
themselves to the same standard and 
only allow the next President to fill 
the Supreme Court seat should a va-
cancy occur during an election year. 
Then, on September 18, 2020, Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away, 46 
days before a Presidential election. 
And with her death, most of our Repub-
lican colleagues changed their tune al-
most overnight. 
Today, with more than 220,000 Ameri-
cans dead and more than 8 million

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6472 
October 25, 2020 
Americans 
infected 
with 
the 
coronavirus—not to mention 13 million 
unemployed—we are in the midst of an 
election, rushing to confirm a con-
troversial 
nominee 
from 
President 
Trump, who lost the popular vote by 
nearly 3 million votes and was subse-
quently impeached by the House. 
Judge 
Barrett’s 
nomination 
was 
rushed out of committee just 12 days 
before election day, in a process that 
many believe was a clear violation of 
the rules of the Judiciary Committee. 
Think about that—12 days. 
Instead of keeping their word, a num-
ber of our Republican colleagues are 
fast-tracking a nominee—and not a 
consensus nominee from the judicial 
mainstream like Judge Merrick Gar-
land—as tens of millions of Americans 
are mailing their ballots in, dropping 
off their ballots, and lining up to vote. 
This confirmation process is shame-
ful. It is unprecedented. If you have 
ever wondered what hypocrisy looks 
like, this is it. 
I know that many Americans, includ-
ing many of our Republican colleagues, 
see in Amy Coney Barrett a well-quali-
fied judge and, in Donald Trump, a 
duly elected President, and they be-
lieve a vote is necessary because, after 
all, it is spelled out in the Constitu-
tion. 
Well, let me be clear. There was no 
precedent for the shameful blockade of 
consideration for Judge Merrick Gar-
land, and there is no precedent for con-
firming Judge Barrett just 8 days be-
fore an election. 
As my colleagues know, I am not 
given to hyperbole, but rushing to con-
firm Judge Barrett has the potential of 
altering, perhaps forever, the way the 
American people view the Supreme 
Court and the U.S. Senate. 
To our Republican friends, let me re-
mind you that just because you can do 
this and get away with it doesn’t make 
it right. This is wrong, and in your 
hearts you know it is wrong. Your ac-
tions stand our system of checks and 
balances on its head—in the end, only 
serving to weaken our democracy, not 
strengthen it. 
To those Americans who want to see 
an up-or-down vote on Judge Barrett, I 
understand that you may not share my 
views or my fears, which many other 
people do share, but let me stop here 
for a moment to share with you some-
thing that isn’t widely known about 
most Republicans and most Democrats 
here in the U.S. Senate. 
While you would never know it most 
days by watching the news, most of us 
who serve in this body generally get 
along. While a lot has changed since 
Senators PAT LEAHY and CHUCK GRASS-
LEY came here a long time ago, bipar-
tisan friendships still endure, although 
they don’t flourish as they once did. 
Many of us agree at times in hearing 
rooms and many of us disagree at 
times in hearing rooms and on the Sen-
ate floor, but just about every week 
that we are in session, a number of 
Democrats and Republicans still find 
time together for prayer and reflection, 
whether at Prayer Breakfast in the 
Capitol or at one of several bipartisan 
Bible study groups, including one led 
by our Senate Chaplain, Barry Black, 
who previously served as Chief of Chap-
lains for the Navy and the Marine 
Corps. 
Oftentimes at these gatherings we 
are reminded of the Golden Rule, one of 
the two greatest commandments: to 
treat other people the way we want to 
be treated. 
After serving here for 20 years, I re-
main convinced that our friendships 
and our ability to reach consensus on 
critical issues facing our Nation are 
based in no small part on our faithful 
adherence 
to 
that 
commandment, 
which can be found in every major reli-
gion of the world, and we are at our 
best here in this body when we follow 
it. 
I believe that true adherence to the 
Golden Rule calls for fairness in the 
way we discharge our constitutional 
responsibilities for judicial nomina-
tions, too, including nominations to 
the Supreme Court, regardless of which 
party occupies the White House or the 
Presiding Officer’s chair. 
We can’t have one set of rules for 
Democratic Presidents and another set 
of rules for Republican Presidents. The 
Golden Rule called for a vote for Judge 
Garland, and I believe that, today, the 
Golden Rule calls for hitting the pause 
button on Judge Barrett’s nomination 
until the President, who is elected in 9 
days, is sworn into office. 
Why? Because the American people 
deserve to have their voices heard. But 
you don’t have to take my word for 
this. Consider, if you will, the words of 
our Republican leader, MITCH MCCON-
NELL, from March 2, 2016, 14 days before 
President Obama had even nominated 
Judge Merrick Garland to serve on the 
Supreme Court, following the death of 
Justice Scalia, and a whole 7 months— 
a whole 7 months—before an election. 
Leader MCCONNELL said 4 years ago: 
The American people deserve to be heard 
on this matter. That’s the fairest and most 
reasonable approach today. 
He went on to say: 
Voters have already begun to choose the 
next President who in turn will nominate 
the next Supreme Court Justice. . . . This is 
something the American people should de-
cide. 
That is what he said 4 years ago. 
Let’s also listen to what the current 
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee, Senator GRAHAM, told us March 
10, 2016. This is what he said: 
I want you to use my words against me. 
Think of that. 
I want you to use my words against me. If 
there’s a Republican President [elected] in 
2016 and a vacancy occurs in the last year of 
the first term, you can say, ‘‘LINDSEY GRA-
HAM said, ‘Let’s let the next President, who-
ever it might be, make that nomination.’ ’’ 
And finally, here is the advice of my 
friend, then-chairman of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, Senator CHUCK 
GRASSLEY, following the death of Jus-
tice Scalia. He said: 
The President should exercise restraint 
and not name a nominee until after the No-
vember election is completed. 
He went on to say: 
President Lincoln is a good role model for 
this practice. The President should let the 
people decide. 
I am glad Senator GRASSLEY men-
tioned our Nation’s 16th President be-
cause I believe President Lincoln’s ex-
ample will serve us well, especially at 
this moment. Why do I say that? 
Well, after a Supreme Court vacancy 
occurred just 27 days before the 1864 
Presidential election, what did Presi-
dent Lincoln do about it? Did he rush 
to fill the vacancy? Did he call the Sen-
ate to push through a nominee in a 
month’s 
time, 
largely 
because 
he 
could? No, he did not. 
In the midst of a Civil War that took 
the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
Americans, Lincoln called for allowing 
the American people first to decide 
who would be President, and that per-
son would then nominate a candidate 
for the vacant seat, with the advice 
and consent of the Senate. 
Nearly 150 years later, Lincoln’s 
words give us a clear roadmap for doing 
the right thing: Let the American peo-
ple have their voices heard before fill-
ing this vacancy, instead of rushing it 
through just days before an election. 
As we all know, the Supreme Court 
seat we are debating today was left va-
cant by the death of Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, who served on the Su-
preme Court since 1993. We continue to 
mourn her loss. We continue to pray 
for her family and loved ones. 
Justice Ginsburg may have been 
small in stature, but, in death, our Na-
tion has lost a true giant. Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg made it her life’s work to 
challenge the laws and systems in this 
country that limited opportunity for 
women solely on the basis of their gen-
der. She was a pioneer in her own 
right, but perhaps even more impor-
tantly, she paved the way for genera-
tions of women and girls who would 
come after her. 
Today, women can sign a mortgage 
on their own in no small part because 
of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Today, women 
can open a bank account or apply for a 
credit card without a male cosigner in 
no small part because of Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. And, today, pregnant women 
cannot be discriminated against at 
work in no small part because of Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. 
I am confident that her legacy will 
live on, especially in all the women and 
young girls she inspired throughout 
her 
remarkable 
life, 
but, 
unfortu-
nately, with her passing, the equality 
that she spent her life fighting for is 
now on the line. 
Many Americans believe in their 
hearts that the threats posed by this 
nominee, the one before us at this mo-
ment, are real. That is particularly 
true when it comes to access to afford-
able healthcare, to the rights of women 
to make their own healthcare deci-
sions, to voting rights, and, perhaps

most importantly, to the future of our 
planet. 
The Affordable Care Act hangs in the 
balance with this nomination. Think 
about that for a moment. Right now, 
our country is in the midst of a public 
health crisis the likes of which those of 
us living have never seen. 
Over 8 million of our fellow Ameri-
cans have been infected with this 
coronavirus. Over 220,000 lives have 
been lost to this deadly virus. That is 
more than the entire population of Des 
Moines, IA. We are consistently seeing 
700 Americans die from the coronavirus 
every day. 
The front page of yesterday’s Wall 
Street Journal makes it clear. It is not 
getting better; it is getting worse. 
As it turns out, America has less 
than 5 percent of the world’s popu-
lation, but our country accounts for 
more than 20 percent of the world’s 
deaths from coronavirus. No other na-
tion on Earth comes close to that. The 
numbers don’t lie. 
Mexico, our neighbor to our south, 
has 
lost 
88,000 
people 
to 
the 
coronavirus; we have lost 220,000. The 
United Kingdom has lost 44,000; we 
have lost 220,000. France has lost 34,000, 
Germany just over 10,000, and we have 
lost over 220,000. Canada, our neighbor 
to the north, has lost just over 9,000; 
Japan, 1,700 deaths; Australia, 905 
deaths; South Korea, just 457 deaths 
from the coronavirus; and we have lost 
over 220,000. 
While this carnage continues here 
and abroad, our friends in the other 
party continue to press the Supreme 
Court to throw out—to throw out—the 
Affordable Care Act in its entirety, not 
next year, next month. 
Meanwhile, nearly 13 million Ameri-
cans are unemployed, and our unem-
ployment rate, at nearly 8 percent, is 
more than double the rate from the be-
ginning of this year. But rather than 
prioritize public health and long-over-
due relief for the millions of Americans 
who are struggling to get by, our Re-
publican colleagues have instead de-
cided to fast-track a Supreme Court 
nominee just 8 or 9 days before a Presi-
dential election. 
So why the rush? Well, to figure that 
out, all you have to do is look at a cal-
endar. Just 7 days after election day on 
November 10, the Supreme Court will 
hear oral arguments in a case known as 
California 
v. 
Texas. 
California 
v. 
Texas—a case that was brought by 18 
Republican attorneys general and the 
Trump administration—seeks to over-
turn the Affordable Care Act in its en-
tirety—in its entirety. 
If confirmed, Judge Barrett may well 
end up casting the deciding vote on 
whether or not to strike down the Af-
fordable Care Act, and we know from 
her own words that Judge Barrett does 
not agree with the decision written by 
Chief Justice Roberts to uphold the 
constitutionality 
of 
the 
Affordable 
Care Act a few years ago. 
She wrote that the Chief Justice had 
‘‘pushed the Affordable Care Act be-
yond its plausible meaning to save the 
statute.’’ Judge Barrett said nothing 
during her confirmation hearing to dis-
tance herself from these words. 
And what exactly could the con-
sequences of overturning the ACA be? 
Well, for starters, those consequences 
could mean that nearly 135 million 
Americans who have a preexisting con-
dition could be charged more for 
healthcare, in many cases making 
their healthcare unaffordable. 
It could mean returning to a time 
when insurers could design plans that 
excluded coverage for contraception 
and family planning, as well as condi-
tions 
like 
pregnancy, 
mental 
healthcare, and substance abuse treat-
ment. 
Overturning the Affordable Care Act 
could 
threaten 
Medicaid 
expansion 
that provides healthcare coverage to 
over 15 million low-income Americans, 
many of them living in some of the 
most rural parts of America. 
It would mean that young adults 
under the age of 26 may no longer be 
able 
to 
stay 
on 
their 
parents’ 
healthcare plans. 
It would jeopardize the tax credit 
that over 9 million Americans receive 
to help cover their own healthcare 
costs. 
And that is just to name a few 
things—just a few. But make no mis-
take, overturning the Affordable Care 
Act in the middle of the night, in the 
middle of the worst pandemic in a cen-
tury, will have devastating and far- 
reaching impacts on our healthcare 
system and nearly every American, in-
cluding the more than 8 million Ameri-
cans who will be left with a new pre-
existing condition: the coronavirus. 
Sadly, that is what our President and 
many of our Republican colleagues are 
intent on doing as we battle COVID–19 
every day and in every State of our 
country. Having failed nearly 100 times 
to repeal or chip away at the Afford-
able Care Act in Congress, Donald 
Trump and many of our Republican 
colleagues are now counting on the Su-
preme Court to do their work for them, 
and they are within one vote—one 
vote—of 
achieving 
their 
goal—one 
vote. 
A woman’s right to make her own 
personal and intimate healthcare deci-
sions hangs in the balance with this 
nomination. During her confirmation 
hearing, Judge Barrett refused to say 
much of anything on this critical wom-
en’s rights issue, including whether 
Roe v. Wade was correctly decided in 
1973. 
Interestingly, though, she did cite 
Justice Ginsburg and the so-called 
Ginsburg rule and asserted that it pre-
vented the nominee—this nominee— 
from indicating how she would rule as 
a Supreme Court Justice on these mat-
ters. But let’s actually look at what 
Justice Ginsburg said about Roe v. 
Wade during her own confirmation 
hearing in 1993, 27 years ago. Justice 
Ginsburg said: 
The decision whether or not to bear a child 
is central to a woman’s life, to her well-being 
and dignity. It is a decision she must make 
for herself. When Government controls that 
decision for her, she is being treated as less 
than a fully adult responsible for her own 
choices. 
Justice Ginsburg did not deflect or 
refuse to answer the central question: 
Should women have the right to make 
their own healthcare decisions? Justice 
Ginsburg was forthright, and the Sen-
ate confirmed her by a vote of 96 to 3— 
96 to 3. 
Given Judge Barrett’s lack of clarity 
on this critical matter, I am left to 
consider her past record and state-
ments. My hope is that Judge Barrett 
would uphold nearly 50 years of prece-
dence and maintain this constitutional 
right for women. However, my fear is 
that Justice Barrett was nominated be-
cause she meets Donald Trump’s stated 
litmus test to overturn this constitu-
tional right that an overwhelming ma-
jority of Americans support. 
Voting rights and the integrity of our 
elections also hang in the balance with 
this nomination. Earlier this week, a 
deadlocked Supreme Court barely—just 
barely—upheld a Pennsylvania lower 
court decision that allows mail-in bal-
lots in Pennsylvania to be counted in 
the upcoming election. The vote was 
tied 4 to 4, which means the issue is not 
settled permanently. It means that 
Judge Barrett may very well be the de-
ciding vote on many disputes related to 
the upcoming election. 
How would a Justice Barrett have 
ruled in the Pennsylvania case? 
During her confirmation hearing, 
Judge Barrett refused to answer ques-
tions about the legality of poll taxes, 
voter intimidation, voter discrimina-
tion, and whether or not the President 
can unilaterally move election day. It 
strains credulity to believe that Judge 
Barrett does not know that poll taxes 
are unconstitutional, that voter in-
timidation is unconstitutional, that 
voter discrimination is unconstitu-
tional, and that the President cannot 
move election day. Why can’t he? Be-
cause—you guessed it—it would be un-
constitutional, even if he tried. 
More than ever, we need Justices on 
the Supreme Court, along with judges 
on other Federal courts, who can be 
counted on by the American people to 
uphold the integrity of the upcoming 
election and on future elections. 
Based on her testimony before the 
Senate Judiciary Committee earlier 
this month, I am not sure that Judge 
Barrett can be counted on by the rest 
of us to ensure that—win or lose— 
President Trump stays within the 
boundaries of the law and abides by the 
will of the American voters on Novem-
ber 3. 
As it turns out, there is a lot more 
than an election that may hang in the 
balance with this nomination, and that 
includes the very future of our planet 
and its inhabitants. 
Over the course of her confirmation 
hearing, on three separate occasions— 
three separate occasions—Judge Bar-
rett refused to acknowledge the plain

and indisputable facts that climate 
change is real and that human activity 
is the primary—not the only but the 
primary—cause of our current climate 
crisis, which we see evidence of almost 
every single day. 
Hurricane-force 
winds 
pierced 
through America’s Heartland this sum-
mer, flattening one-third—one-third— 
of Iowa’s crops in a matter of hours. 
Our east coast and gulf coast are expe-
riencing one of the most active hurri-
cane seasons ever recorded, with more 
tropical storms, more rainfall, and 
more rapid intensification. One of our 
colleagues from Louisiana told me last 
month that his State is losing the 
equivalent of one football field to the 
sea every 100 minutes. That is right— 
not every week, not every month, not 
every day. Every 100 minutes, the 
equivalent of one football field is lost 
to the sea. 
Last summer, fueled by record heat, 
long droughts and as many as 12,000 
lightning strikes in 36 hours—think 
about that, 12,000 lightning strikes in 
36 hours—wildfires destroyed parts of 
California the size of my State. This 
past week Colorado has witnessed wild-
fire destruction that is almost as bad. 
That is not all. This year, record-
breaking heat waves simmered the 
coldest places on Earth, from Antarc-
tica to the Arctic Circle, where the 
temperature reached 100 degrees Fahr-
enheit for the first time ever. That is 
right—100 degrees Fahrenheit along the 
Arctic Circle. Temperatures in Alaska 
reached over 90 degrees Fahrenheit for 
the first time in that State’s history. 
Temperatures in Death Valley reached 
over 134 degrees Fahrenheit—the hot-
test temperature ever recorded on this 
planet. July was the hottest July ever 
recorded. September was the hottest 
September recorded. And, on the heels 
of the hottest decade on Earth, this 
year is on track to be one of the hot-
test years ever recorded—this year. 
And it is not getting better. It is get-
ting worse. 
Yet, when she was first asked, sim-
ply, if climate change was real, Judge 
Barrett responded that she is ‘‘not a 
scientist.’’ 
I am not a scientist, either. I am, 
however, the senior Democrat on the 
Senate Environment and Public Works 
Committee, and like millions of Ameri-
cans, I recognize the simple fact that 
you don’t have to be a scientist to 
trust scientists. You don’t have to be 
entrenched in the studies of science to 
know that it is gravity which is keep-
ing our feet firmly on the ground. 
When Judge Barrett was later asked 
by one of our colleagues whether 
coronavirus is infectious, Judge Bar-
rett said: ‘‘It’s an obvious fact, yes.’’ 
She was then asked if smoking 
causes cancer, and Judge Barrett said: 
‘‘Yes, 
every 
package 
of 
cigarettes 
warns that smoking causes cancer.’’ 
But then, when asked a third ques-
tion—whether or not the nominee be-
lieved that climate change is hap-
pening, and that it is threatening the 
air we breathe and the water we 
drink—Judge Barrett refused to ac-
knowledge the simple fact that climate 
change and global warming are real. 
Instead, Judge Barrett asserted that 
climate change is ‘‘a contentious mat-
ter of debate’’—‘‘a contentious matter 
of debate.’’ 
Climate change is not ‘‘a contentious 
matter of debate.’’ There is over-
whelming consensus among the global 
scientific community that our planet is 
warming, and that warming is caused 
by carbon pollution, largely. Climate 
change is real. We see it every day in 
this country and every day on this 
planet. 
It is threatening the air we breathe 
and the water we drink. The American 
people, and the people of our planet, 
see the effects of climate change and 
global warming every single day, and 
these are indisputable and undeniable 
facts, not a matter of debate. 
Judge Barrett’s views on climate 
change stand in stark contrast to the 
science and the views of the vast ma-
jority of the American people too. 
They also stand in stark contrast to 
the views of the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg. Quite simply, Judge 
Barrett’s views are out of touch with 
reality, and that poses a real threat to 
public health, environmental quality, 
and, I think, the very future of this 
planet. 
Let me echo, if I may, the words of 
President 
Emmanuel 
Macron 
of 
France, who just down the hall here at 
the other end of the Capitol a couple of 
years ago stood before a joint session 
of Congress, and he called for our coun-
try, the United States, to once again 
lead the world on climate change. He 
reminded us, and he said: We have only 
one planet. 
There is no planet B—no planet B. In 
fact, I fear there has never been a more 
dangerous time to confirm a climate 
denier to a lifetime appointment on 
the Supreme Court. Scientists warn 
that we are on the brink of irreversible 
planetary destruction if we do not 
begin to dramatically reduce global 
warming pollution. Over the next few 
decades, the Supreme Court will decide 
the fate of critical environmental 
issues—issues that will aid, or dras-
tically curtail, the abilities of future 
Presidential administrations and Con-
gresses to enact environmental policies 
that are essential to our survival as a 
planet. 
By way of contrast, Judge Barrett’s 
predecessor, Justice Ginsburg, was a 
critical tie-breaking vote on one of the 
most important climate change cases 
in the Supreme Court’s history, called 
Massachusetts v. EPA. 
Recall with me, if you will, that Mas-
sachusetts v. EPA affirmed the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency’s author-
ity and duty to regulate tailpipe emis-
sions of greenhouse gases as a pollut-
ant under the Clean Air Act. 
It also provided the legal underpin-
ning for numerous other Obama admin-
istration climate regulations that the 
Trump administration has been hell- 
bent to destroy. 
Just as the Supreme Court was de-
signed by our Founders to remain 
above the political fray, our Supreme 
Court Justices should not fall prey to 
the blatant misinformation at the 
heart of climate denial. Sadly, during 
her confirmation hearing, Judge Bar-
rett demonstrated that, on an issue so 
critical for the survival of our planet 
as we know it, she does not appear to 
be guided by science and is unlikely to 
be guided by the facts when it comes to 
global warming. 
That, my friends, should scare the 
heck out of us. 
These issues that Justice Ginsburg 
fought so hard to protect over the 
course of her life—healthcare, the 
rights of women to make their own 
healthcare decisions, voting rights, and 
the future of our planet—hang in the 
balance with this nomination, and for 
these reasons, I will not be supporting 
the nomination of Judge Barrett. 
Let me conclude, if I may, by noting 
that Justice Ginsburg did some of her 
most memorable work in dissent. Dur-
ing her memorial service in the U.S. 
Capitol, Justice Ginsburg’s rabbi said: 
Justice Ginsburg’s dissents were not cries 
of defeat. They were blueprints for the fu-
ture. 
Justice Ginsburg knew that just be-
cause you don’t have the votes doesn’t 
mean you are any less right. Justice 
Ginsburg knew that a great dissent 
will speak to the future and just might 
eventually become the majority view. 
Today, we may not have the votes to 
stop this process or vote down this 
nominee, but that doesn’t make our ef-
forts to fight for fairness any less 
right. I could be mistaken, but I be-
lieve in my heart the American people 
will make their voices heard loud and 
clear on what I believe is a sham of a 
confirmation process, and they will do 
it on election day. 
Like Justice Ginsburg, the American 
people are dissenting against this proc-
ess and against this nominee, and I be-
lieve they will be voting in record num-
bers. In fact, they already are. 
Judge Barrett may be confirmed, but 
let history show I tried hard, both to 
follow the Golden Rule and the exam-
ple of Justice Ginsburg, and I refused 
to join the majority opinion. 
With that, I dissent, but I don’t yield 
the 
floor. 
I 
yield 
my 
remaining 
postcloture time to the Democratic 
leader. 
I 
yield 
my 
remaining 
postcloture time to the Democratic 
leader. And I yield to the Senator from 
Washington State, my friend and col-
league. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor to defend a woman’s 
right to choose. I am beyond frustrated 
that this debate is even happening to-
night. According to statistics from the 
Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Net-
work, there are over 433,000 victims of 
rape and sexual assault on average

S6475 
October 25, 2020 
each year in the United States of 
America. They have found that every 
73 seconds an American is sexually as-
saulted. 
When someone wants to chip away at 
the rights of American women to have 
access to healthcare, my State is going 
to take it personally. My State has 
codified Roe v. Wade into law. They 
have fought for these rights in a vote 
by the people of our State in the 1990s. 
So with a process today that is unfold-
ing here in the Senate where someone 
wants to roll back those rights and 
propose a different way of life in the 
United States of America, we women 
are going to fight back. 
The truth is, the majority of Ameri-
cans 
support 
a 
woman’s right to 
choose. The majority of States support 
a woman’s right to choose, in what 
their public believes. It is a minority 
and a minority on this floor who does 
not support that and would love to 
have a judicial process that shortcuts 
active debate about the issues that are 
in the mainstream views of Americans. 
These statistics and these issues are al-
most 50 years of law about a healthcare 
delivery system that allows a woman 
to make this choice. It is from those 
statistics I just read you. There are 
darn good reasons they want to make 
those choices. 
The fact that people have been out 
here characterizing this debate and 
going back in history and talking 
about all of these things that have hap-
pened to previous judicial nominees— 
yes. Yes, there has been a lot of back- 
and-forth. But the main point is, the 
other side of the aisle wants to nomi-
nate people who are out of the main-
stream view of America. 
Any of my colleagues who came here 
and tried to argue that Judge Barrett 
and her views are in the mainstream, I 
guarantee you, the judiciary process 
that we had with the Senate Judiciary 
Committee definitely did not prove 
that. In fact, the President’s words and 
the actions of this body in nominating 
people whose views are out of the 
mainstream—because this is 50 years of 
settled law, and you are trying to over-
ride it by putting somebody on the Su-
preme Court who will say otherwise. 
Adding insult to injury to this whole 
process is the fact that we are not real-
ly doing our day job. We are not deal-
ing with the economic crisis that is 
facing America. I am a little tired of 
that too. I am a little tired of every 
time we have a debate about our econ-
omy—whether it was the fiscal cliff or 
the big budget deal or last year’s budg-
et deal or any budget deal—we never 
can deal with our economy because the 
other side of the aisle wants an amend-
ment to take away a woman’s right to 
choose and limit it. 
I couldn’t even get language in the 
last COVID package to get Boeing 
workers more training programs be-
cause the Republicans were so con-
cerned that the definition of a new 
healthcare proposal had to have a Hyde 
amendment attached to it because oth-
erwise they couldn’t support it because 
it is so Richter scale on our side of the 
aisle. 
I will give my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle—there are about 10 
States that basically have a population 
that only 40 percent or maybe even less 
support a woman’s right to choose. I 
get it. That is a hard State to come 
and represent here if the courts have 
already determined that this is settled 
law. It might be hard for you. But the 
majority of Americans and the major-
ity of the States and the courts have 
already decided this. 
Yes, you are going to continue to 
pursue judicial nominees who are out 
of the mainstream of the American 
people, and you are doing so instead of 
your day job—focusing on the economy 
of the United States during a COVID 
pandemic. 
It wasn’t surprising that this sum-
mer, as we were on recess, the Seattle 
Times said: What is happening? Wall 
Street is flourishing, but Main Street 
is struggling. 
Basically, they raised a question 
while everyone was at home: What are 
we going to come do about the eco-
nomic situation? We know we have had 
tremendous loss. Forty percent of res-
taurants are at risk of remaining 
closed and remaining closed perma-
nently. We know that one in five small 
businesses could be closed by 2021—a 
devastating impact to our economy— 
and we know that 25 percent of those 
businesses need additional resources to 
survive. 
All of those things were known, and 
they were known all summer long, and 
nobody wanted to discuss them because 
the other side didn’t want to get seri-
ous about a robust package. The pack-
age they put on the floor so they could 
go home and say a week before the 
election ‘‘Here is what we tried to vote 
on’’ did not take care of small busi-
nesses that got left out. 
It certainly didn’t talk about the mi-
nority businesses that needed access to 
capital. The last bill did a decent job of 
helping businesses that had a connec-
tion to a banker, but if you didn’t have 
a connection to a banker, you didn’t 
get as much help. We should have sat 
down and fixed this. 
We should have sat down and made 
sure that we were fixing what needed 
to be fixed to help our economy in the 
midst of a COVID pandemic, but, no, 
true to form to the other side of the 
aisle, it is way more important to go 
after a woman’s right to choose. That 
is way more important than these eco-
nomic issues. 
I am going to tell you that we are not 
going to lower our voices on the impor-
tance of our economy or how impor-
tant it is to help women. We are not 
going to sit silently and talk about a 
minimal economic package to help 
American businesses. We are going to 
talk about what American businesses 
need, and we are going to talk about 
how we can help protect a woman’s 
right to choose. 
The nominee before us—I have lis-
tened to many speeches today. She has 
tremendous intellect. She does have 
tremendous intellect. Apparently, that 
is a strong suit of the President of the 
United States. He has strong intellect. 
Yet I have seen the most major assault 
on the rule of law by anybody in an ad-
ministration in my time in the U.S. 
Senate—throwing out fact-based deci-
sions, not guaranteeing due process, 
not making sure that we have freedom 
of the press, corrupt government offi-
cials whom they won’t even get rid of, 
not supporting civil rights that should 
be enforced at the Federal level. It is 
not an issue to be left to the States. 
The Attorney General of the United 
States and the Members of this body 
should enforce the civil liberties of 
Americans. It is not an issue to ignore, 
and you certainly don’t call out the 
military when they want to express 
their opinion and concern about this 
issue. 
The President of the United States 
has a long record. He has great intel-
lect, but he has run over the rule of 
law, and he has set a precedent for 
other people in his administration also 
not to follow the rule of law. 
What I find so challenging about 
Judge Barrett’s record and the issues 
before us is that women’s issues and 
these issues that we face that are so 
important for us to get done are about 
a woman’s access to healthcare. I can’t 
even imagine going back to Griswold v. 
Connecticut—a time when we had to 
fight just to have contraception. That 
is what the privacy rights were all 
about. It was about a Court that de-
cided and found in our Constitution 
that in multiple places, there are a pe-
numbra of rights that give a privacy 
right to a woman to control her own 
body. Those privacy rights are about 
my constitutional rights. They are 
about what is guaranteed to me in the 
Constitution. It is about our finding 
out whether a nominee is going to hold 
them up, particularly at a time when 
we have had almost 50 years of laws 
that have protected those rights. 
People want to have a rushed 30-day 
session—beginning to end—speed-court 
nominating in the Mansfield Room in-
stead of hearing from groups and orga-
nizations about their concerns on this 
nominee. That is just not good for our 
overall system, it is not good for the 
issues that we face moving forward, 
and it is certainly not good for women 
in the United States of America. 
I do not appreciate the rush to con-
firm Judge Barrett. Given my State— 
yes, my State codifying Roe v. Wade 
into statute in 1990 makes me a pretty 
active person who wants to see a judi-
ciary that upholds that. I want to see 
and understand where this nominee is. 
But anyone who comes to the floor 
and says that she is in the mainstream 
views Americans when we know what 
her views have been in opposition to 
Roe v. Wade and, as I said, having Gris-
wold v. Connecticut be a correctly de-
cided decision—even Justices Thomas,

Alito, and Roberts have said it was cor-
rectly decided. Judge Barrett is out of 
the mainstream by not saying that. 
She has been critical of the Afford-
able Care Act and its issues that we 
want so much to cover preexisting con-
ditions. She refused to say whether 
Medicare and Social Security were con-
stitutional; this issue of same-sex mar-
riage, where two in three Americans 
support this; and refusing to say 
whether she thinks the Lawrence v. 
Texas decision, which struck down a 
law criminalizing consensual gay sex, 
was correctly decided. 
These are issues about whether we 
are going to move forward as a nation 
with laws that people have come to ex-
pect and that they planned their lives 
around. 
There are healthcare institutions all 
across 
the 
United States—even in 
States that don’t fully support a wom-
an’s right to choose—that are deliv-
ering healthcare to women, and we are 
going to start down a process of taking 
those away? 
Then there are some people who rep-
resent, on the other side of the aisle, 
States that are at 50 percent or 60 per-
cent in support of a woman’s right to 
choose. They are going to rationalize 
in their head that, oh, well, somehow I 
don’t know where exactly Judge Bar-
rett is going to be on these issues, or, 
I didn’t get a confirmation that she 
truly believes that they are settled 
law, and I believe in the penumbra of 
rights in the Constitution. 
When you say you believe in the pe-
numbra of rights in the Constitution, 
you are saying you believe in my con-
stitutional right to privacy. You say 
you believe that I have the right to 
make my own healthcare decisions. 
With a few days before the election 
and a Supreme Court case in California 
v. Texas, where the ACA and other 
healthcare decisions are going to be on 
the table, it is not good enough to not 
understand the judicial philosophy of 
this nominee and whether that is in 
the mainstream views of people in the 
United States of America. Too much is 
at risk—too much that we deserve to 
know the answers to. 
I am glad my colleague from Dela-
ware brought up Justice Ginsburg’s 
quote because that says it all. Every-
body keeps saying that she didn’t have 
to say anything, that she didn’t take 
notes, that she is all good, that she 
didn’t have to say anything. That is 
not what it is all about. That is not 
what Judge Ginsburg said. Judge Gins-
burg told people exactly what she be-
lieved. She told people that she be-
lieved in a woman’s right to choose. As 
my colleague from Delaware said, she 
told people that these issues were too 
important to a woman. So I don’t un-
derstand, when Justice Ginsburg basi-
cally clarified what she believed, why 
Judge Barrett wouldn’t clarify what 
her judicial philosophy is. 
It is worth reading again. 
Justice Ginsburg said that the deci-
sion of whether or not to bear a child is 
central to a woman’s life, to her well- 
being, to her dignity. It is a decision 
she must make for herself, and when 
government controls that decision for 
her, she is being treated as less than a 
full human who is responsible for her 
own choices. 
These women who have been the sub-
ject of the most heinous acts—and all 
women—deserve to make their own 
healthcare choices. We in this body 
should not be making this decision at 
this moment. We should be taking care 
of our COVID problem, moving forward 
with solutions that will help the Amer-
ican people, and letting them respond 
to this issue. This issue will continue. 
I just ask my colleagues to think 
about what has already happened with 
the Affordable Care Act. Those States 
that didn’t want to support the Afford-
able Care Act and didn’t support the 
Affordable Care Act later, after it 
passed, then implemented it. A few 
States, just recently, made the switch 
and covered more people under Med-
icaid. 
What you are really doing is holding 
your States back from having access to 
healthcare. Eventually, as I said, the 
general public in the majority of 
States will support a woman’s right to 
choose. Eventually, this will be settled, 
with every State supporting this. The 
question is, How long are you going to 
hold up the healthcare choices of peo-
ple in the United States? 
I ask my colleagues to turn down 
this nomination. I ask my colleagues 
to stop nominating people who are out 
of the mainstream of the American 
view on healthcare, which is so impor-
tant to their daily lives. 
I yield my remaining postcloture 
time to the Democratic leader. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Ten-
nessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I really appreciate the oppor-
tunity to come to the floor and have 
time to talk about this nomination. 
As a member of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, I want to express my ap-
preciation to Chairman LINDSEY GRA-
HAM for the great work that he has 
done and to Leader MCCONNELL for the 
way he has given us the opportunity to 
work through this process of com-
pleting this confirmation. 
As I have talked to Tennesseans from 
one end of our State to another, I have 
heard from them, time and again, how 
important they think it is to have a 
judge and a Supreme Court Justice who 
is not an activist. 
As we went through the hearings last 
week, I will tell you that I thought it 
was so interesting. One of our col-
leagues said: Oh, we fear that you will 
usher in an era of conservative activ-
ism. 
They fear that, but do you know 
what? Conservatives do not want activ-
ist judges of any stripe. They want con-
stitutionalists. They want judges to 
abide by the rule of law. They want Su-
preme Court Justices who will call 
balls and strikes. That is what those of 
us on this side of the aisle want—Re-
publicans, Conservatives, and Inde-
pendents, who are there in the center. 
Do you know? That is what they see in 
Judge Barrett. 
I have found it so interesting, as we 
have worked through this process, that 
people, whether they are Democrat, 
Independent, or Republican, have said: 
I was so impressed with her—the way 
she retained knowledge and informa-
tion, the way she represented her 
views, the way she talked about the 
law and precedent, the way she talked 
about the Constitution, the way she 
talked about her relationship with Jus-
tice Scalia. They also liked the way 
her students and her professors and her 
colleagues spoke of Amy Coney Bar-
rett. They like that because these are 
people with whom she works. Her chil-
dren are in school with them. They are 
in church together. So they have come 
to know her through the many dif-
ferent and varied facets of her life, and 
they appreciate who she is and the life 
that the Barrett family is leading and 
how that represents their thoughts and 
their beliefs. 
There are a couple of things I would 
like to discuss and points of clarity 
that deserve to be made in this debate. 
As we were in committee, our friends 
across the aisle chose to take much of 
their time not to get to know Judge 
Barrett or to question her about opin-
ions that have been written, and she 
has written right at 100 opinions or has 
writings that have been published. 
They chose to take their time to dis-
cuss the Affordable Care Act and to 
talk about individuals and the concern 
for losing healthcare. 
I think it is right that the American 
people know we would all like for every 
American to have access to affordable 
healthcare. I think we can say that it 
is a goal of ours. How we get there and 
what the system looks like is going to 
be something that is, really, quite dif-
ferent. They are very wedded to the Af-
fordable Care Act and would really like 
to push this all the way to govern-
ment-run healthcare. That is their 
goal. 
As many people watched the hear-
ings, they asked: Why did they keep 
talking about the Affordable Care Act? 
Of course, the case that is coming be-
fore the Supreme Court is a case on 
severability. It is not about the con-
stitutionality of the ACA. So it was cu-
rious to them. 
I would offer that the reason they 
probably continued to talk about it 
was that our friends across the aisle, 
those in the Democratic Party, are 
very emboldened right now. They feel 
as if they are going to do a clean sweep 
and that they are going to keep the 
House, take the Senate, and take the 
White House and that, when they do, 
they will have a very aggressive, 100- 
day agenda, and we have heard quite a 
bit of conversation about this 100-day 
agenda: statehood for DC and Puerto

Rico. They want to abolish the elec-
toral college. They want to begin im-
plementing the Green New Deal. They 
are going to repeal the Trump tax cuts 
and implement a new corporate tax. 
The list goes on and on. The list in-
cludes what they want to do with 
healthcare, which is to have a govern-
ment-run, government-controlled sys-
tem. 
See, they don’t want anybody to tell 
them they can’t do this. They don’t 
want constitutionalists on the Su-
preme Court who are going to stop 
them from doing this. 
When you look at the numbers and at 
what the numbers tell us, you have 
right at 81⁄2 million people right now 
who are enrolled in the Affordable Care 
Act—or the ObamaCare program—81⁄2 
million. Yet here is the outlier in that: 
In order to reach their goal of govern-
ment-run healthcare, which is, basi-
cally, a Medicaid program for all, what 
you would have to do is strip away the 
health 
insurance 
from 
153 
million 
Americans who have employer-pro-
vided health insurance or who have 
purchased healthcare on the open mar-
ket. Those are 153 million Americans. 
Plus, you would have to take away the 
Medicare 
benefits 
from 
57 
million 
Americans who have paid into Medi-
care with every paycheck they have 
earned all of their working lives. 
We have 66 million Americans who 
are currently in Medicaid. So think of 
what is going to happen if, on top of 
the 66 million who are in the Medicaid 
delivery system, you take everybody 
from Medicare—57 million—and they 
become part of that pool. Then you will 
have taken health insurance away from 
153 million Americans. That is where 
they are headed. That is their goal. 
Quite simply, when they were going 
through the process with the Afford-
able Care Act and you had President 
Obama and Vice President Biden, what 
we would hear many times from some 
of the Democratic leaders was, ‘‘Well, 
ObamaCare is a stop along the road to 
government-controlled healthcare.’’ 
That is their goal, and how dare we 
have a Supreme Court that would get 
in their way. 
That is also why they continue to 
talk about court-packing. While they 
are trying to redefine the meaning of 
the word ‘‘court-packing’’—oh, let’s 
not have it be offensive—oh, no—they 
are wanting to expand the Court so 
they can get their way. 
As my friends across the aisle come 
down and talk about this nomination, I 
think it is important that we look at 
the reason behind some of their work 
and their words and where they think 
they are going, because they have not 
made this nomination about Judge 
Barrett. 
They have not made it about the Su-
preme Court; they have made it about 
themselves. They have made it about 
themselves, their wish list, their desire 
for activist judges. 
How about that? They fear conserv-
ative activism. What are they going 
for? Liberal activism. That is the kind 
of judge they are looking for, not a 
constitutionalist, not somebody who 
calls balls and strikes. They are look-
ing for somebody who is going to do 
their work for them so they don’t have 
to pass something through Congress. 
They don’t have to deal with ‘‘we the 
people.’’ They want to just say: Well, 
according to the Supreme Court, this is 
the law of the land. 
So that is why they chose not to get 
to know Judge Barrett, and I will tell 
you I found her to be one of the most 
impressive women I have ever had the 
opportunity to get to know. And she 
made it very clear, yes, she is qualified 
to sit on the Court. Her record really 
speaks for itself. 
But as we saw, the judge didn’t rest 
on her laurels. She was well prepared. 
She was patient, thorough, respectful, 
and she was a credit to her profession. 
I wish I could say the same for my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
about 
being 
thorough and respectful, because I 
found it to be very disrespectful of the 
process, of the institution, and of 
Judge Barrett that they chose not to 
show up for our hearing. They were not 
there. AWOL. Gone. Didn’t come. 
And you see, why did they do that? 
Judge Barrett, a highly qualified, high-
ly skilled female, is just not the right 
kind of woman. She does not submit to 
the leftist agenda so, therefore, they 
don’t see her as the right kind of 
woman. 
And as we know from many of their 
antics, some from them and some from 
their echo chamber, the mainstream 
media, they feel as if a woman who is 
pro-life, pro-family, pro-religion, pro- 
business—that kind of woman, in their 
eyes, does not deserve a seat at the 
table. 
I find it so interesting. My colleagues 
across the aisle speak often of how 
they value diversity, and I agree. Di-
versity is a strength, and we should 
seek to hear all voices. That should be 
a goal—to hear from everyone. But 
when it comes to diversity of viewpoint 
and 
hearing 
from 
a 
conservative 
woman, an independent woman, a 
right-of-center woman, this side of the 
political spectrum—when it comes to 
diversity of viewpoint, what do they 
do? They repeatedly choose intellec-
tual isolation—intellectual isolation. 
Their mind is made up. They are in 
total submission—total submission to 
the agenda of the left. 
So do not confuse them. Don’t con-
fuse them with facts. Don’t confuse 
them with a counterpoint. Don’t look 
at them and say: How about being open 
minded? You know, what you are say-
ing might be true, but what if this is 
true? Would that change the outcome? 
I find it so very sad that what they 
have done is to choose intellectual iso-
lation. I find it very sad that that is 
what they are role-modeling for young 
adults, college students, high school 
students. Don’t hear out somebody who 
is different from you. Don’t show re-
spect or a listening ear to someone who 
is different from you. Don’t take the 
time to provide the common courtesy 
of listening to what someone may have 
to say. 
To my friends across the aisle, I 
know many of you, and some of you I 
served with when I was in the House, 
and may I just offer a thought—that 
you are better than that. This Chamber 
is better than that. And individuals 
who are nominated for judgeships, for 
Justices on the Supreme Court, they 
deserve to be heard. 
So I would encourage my colleagues 
to think this through. Judge Barrett is 
moving through this process. We are 
going to confirm Judge Amy Coney 
Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court, and 
as we do this, we know that she is 
going to take that seat as a capable, 
competent, skilled jurist, and we know 
that she is going to be someone who is 
going to sit on that Court, and, yes, she 
is going to call balls and strikes. 
Our friends need not worry about an 
era of conservative activism. Let me 
assure them, conservatives don’t want 
that any more than they want an era of 
liberal activism. 
What they want is a constitutionalist 
Court that is going to be fair to every-
one and is focused on equality and jus-
tice for all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BRAUN). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 
1 hour of my remaining postcloture 
time to Senator MURPHY. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The lead-
er has that right. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, every 
woman in this country owes a debt of 
gratitude to my friend, Congresswoman 
Patsy 
Takemoto 
Mink. 
Americans 
probably know Patsy best for her fiery 
advocacy to pass title IX into law. This 
landmark piece of gender equity legis-
lation, which now bears her name, has 
benefited millions of women and girls 
across our country. 
But I would wager that very few peo-
ple know about how Patsy changed the 
course of history for women’s equality 
and helped to enshrine the right of 
women to control our own bodies in the 
Supreme Court. 
Let me tell you a story. In 1970, the 
same year that Hawaii became the first 
State in the country to decriminalize 
abortion, Patsy did something no one 
had done before. She made women’s 
rights a key issue in a Supreme Court 
nomination when she testified against 
the nomination of Judge G. Harrold 
Carswell.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6478 
October 25, 2020 
In her testimony, Patsy brought up 
Judge Carswell’s decision in the case of 
Ida Phillips, a woman denied a factory 
job because she had preschool-aged 
children. Of course, no such rule ap-
plied to fathers. 
Judge Carswell, along with 10 of his 
colleagues on the Fifth Circuit Court of 
Appeals, had refused to hear Ms. Phil-
lips’ case. Patsy told the Senate Judi-
ciary 
Committee: 
‘‘Judge 
Carswell 
demonstrated a total lack of under-
standing of the concept of equality. 
. . . His vote represented a vote against 
the right of women to be treated equal-
ly and fairly under the law.’’ 
When a Republican Senator tried to 
defend Judge Carswell by pointing out 
that 10 other judges had also voted to 
refuse to hear the case, Patsy re-
sponded: ‘‘But the other nine are not 
up for appointment to the Supreme 
Court.’’ 
Patsy understood the critical role 
the Supreme Court plays in the lives of 
every American. She pointed out to the 
committee that ‘‘the Supreme Court is 
the final guardian of our human rights. 
We must rely totally upon its member-
ship to sustain the basic values of our 
society.’’ 
Patsy’s testimony marked a turning 
point in Judge Carswell’s nomination, 
which the Senate ultimately rejected. 
Her courageous action paved the way 
for President Richard Nixon to appoint 
Justice Harry Blackmun to the Court. 
Then, 3 years later, Justice Black-
mun wrote the landmark decision in 
Roe v. Wade, recognizing a woman’s 
constitutional right to control her own 
body. Justice Blackmun, unlike Judge 
Carswell, 
understood 
the 
right 
of 
women to be treated equally. Upon his 
retirement, he observed Roe was, ‘‘a 
step that had to be taken. . . . toward 
the full emancipation of women.’’ 
This story about Patsy is not very 
well known, but it underscores how one 
person can make a difference and how 
one vote on the Supreme Court can 
make a difference. 
During his years on the Court, Jus-
tice Blackmun became a reliable vote 
for racial and gender equality, and his 
decisions reflected an understanding of 
how the Court’s decisions impact the 
lives of millions of Americans. 
If Judge Carswell had been confirmed 
to the Supreme Court instead of Jus-
tice Blackmun, Roe v. Wade would not 
exist as we know it, nor would a host of 
civil rights protections for students 
and racial minorities. 
Our Nation finds itself at a similar 
judicial crossroads today as we debate 
whether Judge Amy Coney Barrett 
should replace Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg on the Supreme Court. The 
choice we face as Senators is clear. It 
is the same choice Patsy Mink pre-
sented to the Senate 50 years ago. We 
can choose to protect equality for 
women, healthcare for millions, and 
other basic values of our society, as 
Patsy put it, or we can choose a Jus-
tice selected to do precisely the oppo-
site: strike down the Affordable Care 
Act, overturn Roe v. Wade, and con-
tinue to decide cases like her conserv-
ative mentor, Justice Antonin Scalia. 
This is neither an abstract nor a hypo-
thetical choice. 
President Trump repeatedly prom-
ised to appoint a Justice who would 
eliminate the ACA and Roe v. Wade, 
and he took only 3 days after Justice 
Ginsburg’s death to pick Judge Barrett 
to fulfill this promise. His selection 
was easy because Judge Barrett had al-
ready publicly signaled that she op-
posed the Affordable Care Act and re-
productive rights. 
Judge Barrett is on record criticizing 
Chief Justice Roberts for, as she put it, 
‘‘push[ing] the Affordable Care Act be-
yond its plausible meaning to save the 
statute’’ in a case upholding the ACA 
in 2012. Justice Scalia wrote the dis-
sent in that case. 
She also signed a newspaper ad com-
mitting to ‘‘oppose abortion on demand 
and defend the right to life from fer-
tilization.’’ The same ad called for ‘‘an 
end to the barbaric legacy of Roe v. 
Wade.’’ 
With Judge Barrett, President Trump 
and Senate Republicans know exactly 
the kind of vote they are getting on 
the Supreme Court. That is why they 
are rushing Judge Barrett onto the 
Court through this hypocritical, ille-
gitimate process. 
In a little over 2 weeks, the Supreme 
Court will hear oral arguments in Cali-
fornia v. Texas—a lawsuit where the 
Trump administration and 18 Repub-
lican State attorneys general are ask-
ing the Court to invalidate the Afford-
able Care Act, like Justice Scalia voted 
to do in two earlier cases. 
My Republican colleagues know they 
can count on her to provide the deci-
sive fifth vote on the Supreme Court to 
strike down the ACA, to help them win 
through the courts an outcome they 
tried and failed to achieve 70 times—70 
times—in Congress. 
The consequences of Judge Barrett’s 
vote to strike down the ACA would be 
catastrophic. It would be catastrophic 
for the 20-plus million Americans who 
obtain health coverage under the ACA 
and the 100 million-plus Americans who 
would lose the law’s protections for 
people living with preexisting condi-
tions. 
These are the types of real-world con-
sequences Justice Ginsburg placed at 
the core of her judicial philosophy and 
approach to the law, which her con-
servative colleagues often ignored. 
We saw this time and again in Jus-
tice Ginsburg’s classic dissents in cases 
like 
Shelby 
County 
v. 
Holder, 
Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire, and Epic 
Systems v. Lewis. Judge Barrett sees 
things much differently. 
When my Democratic colleagues and 
I pressed her about how she would take 
the real-world impact of millions of 
people losing access to healthcare into 
account, she said those are ‘‘policy 
consequences’’ for Congress to address. 
She also tried to parry our questions 
by using terms like ‘‘severability’’ and 
testifying that protections for people 
with preexisting conditions were not at 
issue in the Trump administration’s 
lawsuit. She ignored the fact that more 
than 100 million people with pre-
existing conditions would be harmed if 
the lawsuit succeeds. 
Not an issue? Give me a break. 
My Republican colleagues hope that 
the American people will accept these 
weak attempts to divert our attention, 
but they can’t obscure the real human 
costs of striking down the ACA. It is 
why my Democratic colleagues and I 
have shared the stories of people Judge 
Barrett would harm when she votes to 
strike down the ACA. 
I want to share their stories again 
because their lives are what is at stake 
in this nomination fight. 
Jordan Ota, an elementary school 
teacher from Ewa Beach, has PNH—a 
very rare blood condition. To treat it, 
she receives infusions of a medication 
that costs around $500,000 per year 
without insurance. If Judge Barrett 
strikes down the ACA, Jordan’s insur-
ance company could put a lifetime cap 
on benefits, leaving her without cov-
erage for her lifesaving medication. 
Jordan’s father Dean told me that 
‘‘without the medicine, she will die.’’ 
Kimberly Dickens from Raleigh, NC, 
couldn’t afford health insurance until 
the Affordable Care Act became law. 
Kimberly used her new insurance to 
get a checkup and a mammogram that 
found her breast cancer. With her 
health insurance, Kimberly was able to 
get a mastectomy and has been cancer- 
free ever since. Kimberly said: 
The ACA saved my life. . . . It scares me to 
think: If I didn’t have insurance, how far ad-
vanced would the cancer have grown? 
These powerful stories demonstrate 
the real-world danger of Amy Barrett’s 
judicial philosophy if she is confirmed 
to the Court. But their healthcare is 
not the only fundamental right at risk 
for Americans. We know this because 
Judge Barrett has also aligned herself 
with the conservative wing of the 
Court, long led by her mentor, Justice 
Scalia. 
At her nomination ceremony, Judge 
Barrett 
announced 
that 
Justice 
Scalia’s ‘‘judicial philosophy is mine 
too.’’ Aligning herself so closely with 
Justice Scalia has implications for a 
whole host of rights and protections 
the Court has granted over the years. 
Justice Scalia, for example, wrote 
dissents in the landmark cases recog-
nizing LGBTQ rights from Romer v. 
Evans to Lawrence v. Texas, and 
United States v. Windsor. Most re-
cently, he wrote a dissent in Obergefell 
v. Hodges, sharply criticizing the ma-
jority for recognizing a right to same- 
sex marriage that in his originalist 
view was not in the Constitution. 
Because Judge Barrett calls herself 
an 
originalist 
and 
shares 
Justice 
Scalia’s judicial philosophy, his deci-
sions provide a preview of how she 
would have ruled in those cases. 
For example, although the Supreme 
Court has already affirmed marital

rights for LGBTQ Americans, Judge 
Barrett’s radical views on precedent 
put these rights at risk. Judge Barrett 
has argued that as part of her duty, a 
Justice should ‘‘enforce her best under-
standing of the Constitution rather 
than a precedent she thinks clearly in 
conflict with it.’’ 
Clearly, Judge Barrett’s confirma-
tion would put Obergefell at risk, and 
her would-be colleagues on the Court 
have taken notice. 
During this nomination process, Jus-
tices 
Thomas 
and 
Alito—also 
originalists—released 
an 
alarming 
statement in Davis v. Ermold, which 
the Court declined to review. But these 
two Justices criticized Obergefell for 
‘‘read[ing] a right to same-sex mar-
riage into the 14th Amendment, even 
though that right is found nowhere in 
the text.’’ 
In effect, these two Justices invited a 
challenge to Obergefell by calling it ‘‘a 
problem that only [the Court] can fix.’’ 
This type of signaling is a dangerous 
and 
increasingly 
common 
practice 
among the Court’s conservative wing. 
By making their views known in this 
way, these Justices are inviting would- 
be litigants to bring challenges to the 
Court so the Court can then use those 
challenges 
to 
invalidate 
landmark 
precedent, which is what happened in 
Janus v. AFSCME. 
As a member of the Seventh Circuit, 
Judge Barrett has also demonstrated a 
willingness to signal her views on 
precedent that could have significant 
implications if she is confirmed to the 
Supreme Court. 
One example came in Price v. City of 
Chicago, where Judge Barrett joined a 
decision that upheld the so-called abor-
tion clinic buffer zone law. The deci-
sion made clear that her circuit court 
was forced to uphold this law under the 
Supreme Court precedent, but it sig-
naled a strong disagreement with that 
precedent. The decision, which she 
joined, criticized the precedent as ‘‘in-
compatible’’ with the First Amend-
ment and ‘‘impos[ing] serious bur-
dens.’’ 
Judge Barrett’s alignment with Jus-
tice Scalia, her radical views on Su-
preme Court precedent, and her dis-
regard for real-world impacts on her 
decision making as a judge show how 
many rights and protections are at 
risk: LGBTQ rights, voting rights, 
women’s 
equality, 
healthcare—you 
name it. 
These rights didn’t just materialize 
out of thin air. They came after hard- 
fought battles and tremendous sac-
rifices from trailblazers like Patsy 
Mink and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. 
When Patsy called the Supreme 
Court ‘‘the final guardian of our human 
rights’’ that ‘‘sustains the basic values 
of our society,’’ she deeply understood 
what that meant—for women’s equal-
ity, for civil rights, and for so many 
other rights. 
Republicans understand that clear 
majorities of Americans support the 
ACA, a woman’s right to choose, and 
the right for LGBTQ couples to marry. 
Yet, because Republicans fear they are 
losing the election, they are erasing 
Judge Barrett’s nomination through a 
hypocritical and illegitimate process 
to put her on the Court for life before 
voters can make their voices fully 
heard. 
But we have all seen the news cov-
erage of thousands of voters standing 
in line for hours on end in the cold and 
rain to make sure their voices are 
heard and their votes are counted. 
Clearly, the voters understand what 
is at stake. They are doing their part. 
Now it is time for the Senate to do 
ours by rejecting Judge Barrett’s nomi-
nation to the Supreme Court. 
By doing so, we can stand up for what 
Patsy Mink called the ‘‘basic values of 
society’’ and against Donald Trump 
and Senate Republicans’ assault on 
healthcare, a woman’s right to control 
her own body, and LGBTQ rights, 
among so many others. 
This nomination fight is close to 
being over, but the broader fight for 
the future of our Nation continues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my strong opposition 
to the nomination of Amy Coney Bar-
rett to replace Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg as an Associate Justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
The Senate has never confirmed a 
Supreme Court nominee while a Presi-
dential election was already underway. 
Indeed, this is the situation before us 
with early voting taking place in mul-
tiple States and over 50 million ballots 
already cast. So while those in the far- 
right fringe might be cheering these 
lifetime appointments, the vast major-
ity of Americans are the ones who lose 
out, and they do not get a fair say. 
Make no mistake. Today’s vote isn’t 
about one individual; it is about taking 
away healthcare from 20 million Amer-
icans in the midst of a pandemic. It is 
about eliminating protections for peo-
ple with preexisting conditions that 
over 100 million Americans depend 
upon. And that is what we fear hap-
pening once this vote is cast, the life-
time appointment is given, and the 
case is heard after the election. 
President Trump and his allies pur-
posely set the schedule that way. They 
didn’t want American voters to have 
any recourse to take out their anger at 
those responsible for taking away their 
healthcare. 
My Republican colleagues should lis-
ten to their own words. Go back and 
look at what you said about Merrick 
Garland and apply it consistently. 
Our fidelity is to the Constitution, 
not a caucus, not to the Federalist So-
ciety, not to special interests. Every-
one deserves equal justice under the 
law. The Supreme Court was not de-
signed to become an extension of the 
Republician National Committee. 
The chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee pledged, in his own words: ‘‘If 
an opening comes in the last year of 
President Trump’s term and the pri-
mary process has started, we’ll wait 
till the next election.’’ 
The obvious truth is Republicans 
broke their word. This process itself is 
broken. Their pattern of obstruction 
and abusive partisanship over the years 
threatens the credibility of the Su-
preme Court and pushes Senate norms 
of fairness and accountability beyond 
the brink. 
My decision, however, to oppose this 
nomination rests not only on this un-
precedented use and abuse of power but 
also on the standard that I have ap-
plied to nominees of the Supreme 
Court on numerous occasions. It is a 
simple test—one drawn from text, the 
history, and the principles of the Con-
stitution. 
As I have said during previous con-
firmations, a nominee’s intellectual 
gifts, experience, judgment, maturity, 
and temperament are all important. 
But these alone are not enough. 
In addition, a nominee to the Su-
preme Court must live up to the spirit 
of the Constitution. A nominee must 
not only commit to enforcing the laws 
but to doing justice. A nominee must 
give life and meaning to the great prin-
ciples of the Constitution: equality be-
fore the law, due process, freedom of 
conscience, individual responsibility, 
and the expansion of opportunity. 
It is these principles that ensure full 
and fair and equal participation in the 
civic and social life for all Americans. 
A nominee to the Supreme Court must 
make these constitutional principles 
resonate in a rapidly changing world. 
My colleagues on the Judiciary Com-
mittee spent a great deal of time and 
effort questioning Judge Barrett and 
trying to elicit responses about her 
basic worldview and judicial philos-
ophy. Unfortunately, her answers were 
largely nonresponsive, and, at times, 
she demurred on issues on which she 
herself had already made public state-
ments. 
Despite her lack of responsiveness, 
Judge Barrett’s judicial record and 
public statements suggest that she 
does not meet my test, and her place-
ment on the Supreme Court will fur-
ther tilt the Court away from these 
constitutional principles. 
In understanding how Judge Barrett 
would not meet my test, I am cog-
nizant that she will follow in the mold 
of her mentor Justice Antonin Scalia, 
with whom she shares an originalist 
approach to constitutional interpreta-
tion. 
In her article titled ‘‘Congressional 
Originalism,’’ 
Judge 
Barrett 
talks 
about the core principles underpinning 
originalism. The first principle, she 
writes, is that ‘‘the meaning of the 
constitutional text is fixed at the time 
of its ratification.’’ The second is that 
‘‘the historical meaning of the text 
‘has legal significance and is authori-
tative in most circumstances.’ ’’ 
The trouble is that the Founders and 
Framers did not leave us a blueprint to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

October 25, 2020 
answer every new question of law. Nor 
did the delegates to the Constitutional 
Convention demand that all future 
judges be ‘‘originalists.’’ The laws and 
norms when the Constitution was rati-
fied would alienate and exclude many 
Americans today, particularly women 
and racial and other minority groups. 
We have seen the devastating effects 
of the originalist line of thinking in 
the Supreme Court’s recent history. A 
focus on this mode of interpretation 
has played a crucial role in undoing 
labor rights, curtailing environmental 
regulations, and allowing unlimited 
dark money to influence politics. In 
the end, a strict originalist approach 
tends to favor the executive over the 
individual, the employer over the em-
ployee, and the corporation over the 
consumer. 
Also relevant to whether Judge Bar-
rett passes my test is her criticism of 
stare decisis, a core concept in Su-
preme Court jurisdiction under which a 
court generally adheres to its prior de-
cisions—absent a special justification 
more than a belief that the precedent 
was wrongly decided. 
Part of the reason that maintaining 
precedent is so important is that it en-
sures the rule of law and legitimacy of 
the judicial process. As Alexander 
Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 
78, there is a long tradition of being 
bound by precedent, in his words, ‘‘[t]o 
avoid an arbitrary discretion in the 
courts.’’ 
A practical reason for following 
precedent is that—once it goes into ef-
fect, people then organize their lives 
based on the law and make decisions 
with the assumption that that law will 
stay in place. 
The public expects judges to under-
stand this need for stability and to ap-
proach the law with the appropriate 
humility and respect for its authority. 
They do not want judges to elevate 
their own views over the law or to 
change the law simply because the 
composition of the court changes. 
That is why, in deciding to overrule 
precedent, a court generally undergoes 
a serious analysis of numerous factors, 
including its consistency with other 
decisions, the reliance interests at 
stake, 
and 
historical 
developments 
since the decision in question. 
Therefore, I am troubled that Judge 
Barrett’s writings indicate that she is 
more likely to see opportunities to re-
visit precedent than other judges. In an 
article titled ‘‘Precedent and Jurispru-
dential Disagreement,’’ Judge Barrett 
argues that there is a weaker presump-
tion of stare decisis in constitutional 
cases, which could make these cases 
more vulnerable to review. 
In another article titled ‘‘Stare Deci-
sis and Due Process,’’ Judge Barrett ar-
gues that the current standard of stare 
decisis has become too rigid in modern 
times and favors a more flexible stance 
on reexamining precedent. 
In particular, I take seriously that 
Judge Barrett indicates that she is 
more willing to elevate her originalist 
interpretation over precedent. Overall, 
when there is a tension between prece-
dent and jurisprudential commitment, 
Judge Barrett writes that she, in her 
words, ‘‘tend[s] to agree with those 
who say that a justice’s duty is to the 
Constitution and that it is thus more 
legitimate for her to enforce her best 
understanding 
of 
the 
Constitution 
rather than a precedent she thinks is 
clearly in conflict with it.’’ 
She similarly casts doubt on the im-
portance of reliance interests—which 
are the interests of stakeholders that 
depend on the continuity of an af-
firmed 
law 
or 
right—stating 
that 
‘‘when precedent clearly exceeds the 
bounds of statutory or constitutional 
text, reliance interests should figure 
far less prominently in a court’s over-
ruling calculus.’’ 
Judge Barrett’s views on originalism, 
textualism, and stare decisis could 
bring about a seismic shift to the Su-
preme Court, reshaping modern Amer-
ican life and weakening rights to which 
many Americans have become accus-
tomed. Given that Judge Barrett’s ap-
proach is shared by several of her fu-
ture colleagues, she will help move the 
Court’s center of gravity to the far 
right. 
I will now walk through issues in 
Judge Barrett’s judicial record that in-
form how she, in conjunction with fel-
low conservative judges, could and 
likely will rule on future cases. 
I am deeply troubled about the impli-
cations of this nomination on the Af-
fordable Care Act, the ACA. The ACA 
has given individuals and families con-
trol over their own healthcare and has 
brought the uninsured rate to a his-
toric low. The ACA has been the law of 
the land since 2010 and is now woven 
into the fabric of our healthcare sys-
tem. 
Despite consistent sabotage of the 
ACA by the Trump administration, 
premiums for health insurance plans 
on the individual marketplaces have 
decreased for the second year in a row. 
Yet President Trump and my Repub-
lican colleagues want to repeal the 
ACA in its entirety, taking with it pro-
tections for people with preexisting 
conditions, bans on lifetime and annual 
limits on coverage, billions of dollars 
in tax credits to make coverage more 
affordable, and efforts to close the 
doughnut hole for seniors needing pre-
scription drugs, just to name a few key 
provisions. 
The ACA is a relevant—indeed, crit-
ical—aspect of the nomination because 
the Supreme Court will begin hearing 
oral arguments in the case of Cali-
fornia v. Texas on November 10, which 
will decide the fate of the ACA. This is 
not a theoretical debate over how 
Judge Barrett may interpret a case in 
the future. This is a real case that 
could eliminate health insurance cov-
erage for millions of Americans and in-
crease costs for everyone in the next 
year. 
It is no surprise that my Republican 
colleagues are breaking with their own 
precedent to consider this nominee 
with a week to go until the election. 
This is their chance to repeal the ACA 
once and for all. 
In fact, President Trump has said 
many times over in the last several 
months that he hopes the ACA is over-
turned by the Supreme Court, referring 
specifically to this case. And don’t just 
take his word for it. The Department of 
Justice, 
under 
his 
leadership, 
has 
taken the extraordinary step of decid-
ing against defending the law of the 
land, the ACA, and instead siding with 
the plaintiffs in arguing that the ACA 
and its protections for people with pre-
existing conditions, among other provi-
sions, is unconstitutional. President 
Trump and congressional Republicans 
are very clear about their intentions. 
They want to repeal the ACA. They 
have been saying it for a decade. 
They failed to do it when they had 
complete control of the White House 
and Congress because of overwhelming 
public opposition to their efforts and a 
few brave votes. They are relying on 
the Supreme Court to do their dirty 
work for them and get rid of the ACA. 
They even petitioned to have the case 
heard by the Supreme Court after the 
election, knowing that the American 
people would not be happy if the Court 
decided in their favor and struck down 
the ACA. 
It is not hard to follow the logic here. 
President Trump and congressional Re-
publicans have been working methodi-
cally to lead us to this moment for 
years. 
Now I will return to the nominee for 
a moment. President Trump has made 
it clear that he intends to have the 
courts do his bidding for him and has 
committed to nominating judges who 
will side with him. 
In her hearing, Judge Barrett refused 
to discuss how she may handle a case 
on the ACA. However, in early 2017, she 
authored an article criticizing the 
ACA, specifically arguing that the 2012 
Supreme Court case, NFIB v. Sebelius, 
was wrongly decided when a 5-to-4 ma-
jority ruled that the ACA’s individual 
mandate was, in fact, constitutional. 
In particular, Judge Barrett criticized 
Chief Justice Roberts’ deciding vote in 
that case, claiming that he ‘‘pushed 
the Affordable Care Act beyond its 
plausible meaning to save the statute.’’ 
Instead, Judge Barrett has praised 
her mentor, the late Justice Scalia, in 
his criticism of the ACA, as displayed 
in his dissents in both the NFIB case as 
well as the case of King v. Burwell, re-
lated to the tax credits provided by the 
ACA. 
So while the nominee has not said 
how she may rule in the case of Cali-
fornia v. Texas on whether the ACA is 
constitutional, she didn’t have to. We 
already know that, had she been on the 
Court in 2012 when NFIB v. Sebelius 
was decided or in 2015 when King v. 
Burwell was decided, she likely would 
have voted to invalidate key elements 
or all of the ACA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6481 
October 25, 2020 
Between her public writings and 
President Trump’s commitment to ap-
pointing judges who are hostile to the 
ACA, I don’t think it is a stretch to 
imagine how a future Justice Barrett 
may vote in California v. Texas. The 
stakes for millions of Americans are 
just too high to support this nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court. 
I 
am 
also 
concerned 
by 
Judge 
Barrett’s extreme views on the Second 
Amendment and the constitutionality 
of limits on gun possession. To under-
stand her position, one must first un-
derstand the test set in District of Co-
lumbia v. Heller. This case involved a 
challenge to the District of Columbia 
laws that generally made it unlawful 
to possess an operable firearm in the 
home. 
Justice Scalia authored the major-
ity’s opinion and was joined by Justice 
Roberts and Justices Thomas, Ken-
nedy, and Alito. 
In Heller, the Supreme Court struck 
those laws down and affirmed the right 
to keep guns in the home for self-de-
fense, while making clear that rights 
secured under the Second Amendment 
are not unlimited. The Court provided 
a nonexhaustive list of gun restriction 
laws that were presumptively lawful, 
including prohibitions on firearms pos-
sessed by felons and the mentally ill. 
However, in the case Kanter v. Barr, 
Judge Barrett filed a dissent laying out 
a rationale that could lead to the strik-
ing down of even commonsense gun re-
strictions. In this case, the plaintiff 
was convicted of felony mail fraud and 
was subsequently prohibited from pos-
sessing a firearm under both Federal 
and State law. 
When he challenged these laws as 
violating the Second Amendment, the 
majority concluded that Federal and 
State governments were entitled to bar 
firearms possession by people con-
victed of felonies. Judge Barrett dis-
agreed and concluded that barring non-
violent felons from possessing firearms 
is 
not 
allowed 
under 
the 
Second 
Amendment. She reasoned that, in her 
words, ‘‘History does not support the 
proposition that felons lose their Sec-
ond Amendment rights solely because 
of their status as felons. But it does 
support the proposition that the state 
can take the right to bear arms away 
from a category of people that it deems 
dangerous.’’ 
Her position lies outside the widely 
accepted view that gun restrictions for 
public safety are constitutional under 
the Second Amendment. Her opinion 
puts her to the right of Justice Scalia, 
who delivered the majority opinion in 
Heller. 
Her vote in Kanter makes it more 
likely that Judge Barrett would vote 
to strike down similar restrictions on 
firearm possession, even by individuals 
with serious criminal histories. This 
outcome alone is concerning. 
Beyond that, her views, coupled with 
the originalist approach to the Second 
Amendment endorsed by several sitting 
Justices, portend that a conservative 
majority could create stricter stand-
ards of scrutiny for Second Amend-
ment cases. 
It is important to note that Justice 
Ginsburg joined other Justices in de-
clining opportunities to revisit Heller’s 
application. That includes the denial of 
ten certiorari petitions this past term 
that called for the Court to review, and 
possibly invalidate, challenges to State 
gun safety laws, including State con-
cealed-carry laws, gun permit require-
ments, and assault weapons bans. 
Given that only four votes are needed 
to grant certiorari review, Judge Bar-
rett could play an important role in de-
ciding whether the Supreme Court adds 
Second Amendment cases to its docket. 
This could generally put commonsense 
gun safety laws, even those that have 
been upheld for years, at an increased 
risk of being overturned. 
Furthermore, as part of a conserv-
ative majority, Judge Barrett could 
initiate major rollbacks of privacy 
rights in one’s own home life. During 
her confirmation hearings, Judge Bar-
rett declined to say whether the Su-
preme Court cases—Griswold v. Con-
necticut, 
Lawrence 
v. 
Texas, 
and 
Obergefell v. Hodges—were correctly 
decided. The Griswold case from 1965, 
in particular, is a foundational case in 
this arena. Griswold, holding that mar-
ital privacy extends to the right to buy 
and use contraception, led to cases ex-
tending privacy in other reproductive 
decisions. In her refusal, Judge Barrett 
took a departure from past nominees 
who have affirmed that Griswold is set-
tled law, including Chief Justice Rob-
erts and Justices Alito, Kavanaugh, 
and 
Kagan. 
Instead 
of 
giving 
a 
straightforward answer, Judge Barrett 
contended that it is unlikely that a re-
lated case would come before the Court 
and tried to frame this issue as well 
settled. However, in Little Sisters of 
the Poor V. Pennsylvania, it is notable 
that the Supreme Court has very re-
cently allowed Trump administration 
rules to go into effect, allowing vir-
tually any employer to deny contracep-
tive coverage based on religious and 
moral objections. Therefore, it is clear 
that this issue is not beyond dispute 
and could come back before the Court. 
Obergefell and Lawrence were land-
mark cases that established privacy 
rights around marriage and intimate 
relations between consenting adults, 
regardless of their genders. While it 
may be unthinkable that these and 
similar rights, which are integral to a 
person’s ability to construct their per-
sonal and family lives, could be under-
mined, there are worrying indications 
that they may come again before the 
Court. 
Just this month, Justices Thomas 
and 
Alito 
wrote 
that 
they 
see 
Obergefell—which granted the right to 
same-sex marriage—as something the 
Court needs to fix and that the decision 
has had ‘‘ruinous consequences for reli-
gious liberty.’’ 
Given that Justice Ginsburg was a 
crucial vote in the Obergefell 5-to-4 
opinion, it is conceivable that a 6–3 
conservative Court could chip away at 
equality were these rights to be reliti-
gated. 
A conservative Court may also act as 
a bulwark against further expanding 
privacy protections in family life. For 
example, a case is set to come before 
the Court this term, Fulton v. Phila-
delphia, in which private agencies that 
receive taxpayer funding to provide 
government services, such as foster 
care agencies, could be determined to 
have a constitutional right to deny 
services to persons on the basis of sex-
ual orientation. 
The next area of concern is how 
Judge Barrett’s record will impact 
workers’ rights. Unfortunately, Judge 
Barrett has a record of voting in favor 
of business interests. Judge Barrett 
voted to reject an en banc review in 
Equal Employment Opportunity Com-
mission v. AutoZone, regarding an em-
ployer’s policy of assigning Black and 
Latino employees to stores in neigh-
borhoods with people predominantly of 
their same race—creating a ‘‘Black 
store’’ and a ‘‘Hispanic store.’’ Judge 
Barrett’s 
colleague 
who 
dissented 
called this a ‘‘separate but equal ar-
rangement’’—a type of unlawful dis-
crimination, which was well settled by 
Brown v. Board of Education. 
During her confirmation hearings, 
she agreed that Brown was correctly 
decided and beyond overruling. How-
ever, 
Judge 
Barrett’s 
decision 
in 
AutoZone indicates she is willing to ac-
cept racially segregated actions by an 
employer, even when they would be dif-
ficult to reconcile with the core hold-
ings of Brown. 
In 
another 
discrimination-related 
case, Kleber v. CareFusion, Judge Bar-
rett joined the en banc decision allow-
ing an employer to post a job applica-
tion with maximum years of experi-
ence, essentially barring applicants 
older in age. The majority took a nar-
row view that the ambiguous language 
of the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act did not apply in this case, 
reasoning that it applied only to cur-
rent employees and not to job appli-
cants. 
In both AutoZone and Kleber, Judge 
Barrett has opened the door for em-
ployers to run afoul of our country’s 
civil rights laws. This is particularly 
concerning because the Supreme Court 
will likely take up cases deciding who 
is protected from workplace discrimi-
nation. For example, the Court could 
face legal challenges in the wake of 
Bostock v. Clayton County, which con-
firmed that title VII of the Civil Rights 
Act prohibits employers from discrimi-
nating against LGBTQ people. The ma-
jority’s opinion, however, warned that 
future cases will determine whether 
businesses could use religious freedom 
claims to ‘‘supersede Title VII’s com-
mands.’’ 
Judge Barrett had additionally ruled 
against employees and gig workers by 
limiting their ability to hold employ-
ers accountable through collective ar-
bitration in the cases, Herrington v.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6482 
October 25, 2020 
Waterstone Mortgage and Wallace v. 
Grubhub Holdings. Given that disputes 
around the rights of gig economy work-
ers and the prevalence of forced arbi-
tration agreements are only increas-
ing, related cases are likely to come 
before the Supreme Court. It is nota-
ble, in coming to her conclusion in 
Grubhub, Judge Barrett cited Epic Sys-
tems v. Lewis, in which the Supreme 
Court held that arbitration agreements 
in which an employee agrees to arbi-
trate any claims against an employer 
on an individual basis—rather than as 
a class—are enforceable. In that case, 
Justice Ginsburg took the rare step of 
reading a particularly strong dissent 
from the bench, saying that the Court’s 
ruling was ‘‘egregiously wrong’’ and 
‘‘holds enforceable these arm-twisted, 
take-it-or-leave-it contracts—including 
the provisions requiring employees to 
litigate wage and hours claims only 
one-by-one.’’ Were a similar case to 
come before the Supreme Court again, 
it is likely that Judge Barrett and a 
conservative majority would take a 
sharp turn away from Justice Gins-
burg’s legal position and make it hard-
er for workers to get their day in 
court. 
I am further concerned that a 6–3 
conservative 
majority 
Court 
could 
have a drastic impact in limiting vot-
ing rights. Voter suppression has a 
long history in this country, with 
Black voters being subjected to violent 
intimidation and legally sanctioned 
disenfranchisement. In recognition of 
this history and after decades of activ-
ism on the part of many, President 
Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting 
Rights Act, which in part required ju-
risdictions with a history of discrimi-
nation to get approval before changing 
its voting rules. This process, known as 
preclearance, was intended to prevent 
voter 
discrimination 
before 
it 
oc-
curred. This law had an immediate and 
positive impact in increasing Black 
voter registration and turnout in the 
decades after it passed. 
However, in Shelby County v. Holder, 
the 
Supreme 
Court’s 
conservative 
members argued in a 5-to-4 ruling that 
the preclearance formula was no longer 
necessary and outdated, exactly be-
cause it was successful. In her dissent, 
Justice Ginsburg famously pointed out 
the absurdity of the majority’s rea-
soning. She wrote that ‘‘throwing out 
preclearance when it has worked and is 
continuing to work to stop discrimina-
tory changes is like throwing away 
your umbrella in a rainstorm because 
you are not getting wet.’’ Predictably, 
the ruling in Shelby opened the flood-
gates for States to enact restrictive 
and insidious voting laws, including 
strict voter identification, excessive 
voter purging, and gerrymandering. In 
the wake of Shelby, the awesome power 
of the Supreme Court to restore or fur-
ther damage voting rights has become 
apparent. 
That is why it is troubling that in 
her dissent in Kanter—which I have al-
ready 
referred 
to—Judge 
Barrett 
framed the right to vote as a lesser 
right and argued for States’ ability to 
limit civic participation. As I ex-
plained earlier, in the Kanter case, she 
disagreed with the majority’s opinion 
that found that all individuals with fel-
ony convictions could be legally re-
stricted from possessing a firearm. The 
majority reasoned that Second Amend-
ment protections belong to virtuous 
citizens, meaning that persons who 
commit serious crimes may forfeit 
those rights. Judge Barrett used this 
opportunity to elevate the importance 
of Second Amendment rights in con-
trast with voting rights. After evalu-
ating the historical record, she con-
cluded that ‘‘while scholars have not 
identified eighteenth or nineteenth or 
century laws’’—and it is interesting to 
note that we are being guided by 18th 
and 19th century laws under Judge 
Barrett’s legal theories. ‘‘While schol-
ars have not identified eighteenth or 
nineteenth century laws depriving fel-
ons of the right to bear arms, history 
does show that felons could be disquali-
fied from exercising certain rights— 
like the rights to vote and serve on ju-
ries—because these rights belong only 
to virtuous citizens.’’ 
She explained that, in her view, gun 
rights are individual rights conferred 
by the Second Amendment, and exclu-
sions on nonvirtuous citizens do not 
apply to individual rights. Judge Bar-
rett then distinguished the right to 
vote and sit on juries as belonging in a 
different 
category 
called 
‘‘civic 
rights.’’ She upheld the ability of 
States to limit this class of rights 
based on virtue exclusions. In doing so, 
she cited a history of State laws going 
back to 1820 that excluded felons from 
voting. Judge Barrett, however, failed 
to include in her analysis the very his-
tory of voter discrimination that led to 
the passage of the Voting Rights Act 
and which would have given important 
context to the laws that she cited, 
which sought to disenfranchise individ-
uals with criminal records. 
I am also concerned because Judge 
Barrett refused to answer several ques-
tions on voting and elections during 
her confirmation hearings. Even when 
asked to confirm voter protections al-
ready enshrined in Federal law, she 
was not able to give a straightforward 
answer. 
These 
exchanges 
gave 
me 
pause that Judge Barrett has not dis-
played an appreciation for the norms 
that make our democratic and elec-
toral institutions function. 
I would next like to focus on Judge 
Barrett’s potential in limiting the au-
thority of the Federal and, indeed, 
State governments. If confirmed to the 
Supreme Court, Judge Barrett’s judi-
cial philosophy of originalism is poised 
to diminish the role of Congress as ef-
fective policymakers. This method of 
interpretation could disregard the com-
monsense application and spirit of Fed-
eral laws. An example of this is the 
case 
I 
discussed 
earlier, 
NFIB 
v. 
Sebelius, where the Court decided with 
a 5–4 majority that the ACA’s indi-
vidual mandate is constitutional. The 
Court, however, created a new limita-
tion on Congress’s authority to act 
under the Commerce Clause. Using an 
originalist approach, the Court found 
that Congress can regulate commercial 
activity but rejected the idea it could 
compel an individual to engage in it. 
The majority did uphold the Congress’s 
power to do so under its article I pow-
ers to levy taxes. Alarmingly, four dis-
senting 
Justices—Justices 
Scalia, 
Thomas, 
Kennedy, 
and 
Alito—ex-
pressed the view that neither the Com-
merce Clause nor Congress’s taxing 
powers supported the individual man-
date. I will note that, had Judge Bar-
rett been on the Court, she likely 
would have joined the dissenting Jus-
tices, and this case might have gone 
the other way. 
The implications of this case are sig-
nificant. Taken together, Chief Justice 
Roberts’ opinion and the dissent are 
centered around the idea that the use 
of 
a 
Commerce 
Clause 
and/or 
Congress’s taxing power under the ACA 
was a major legislative overreach. It 
signals that the Court increasingly 
sees these and potentially other con-
gressional authorities as having more 
limits. So in the future, when Congress 
tries to use its power for a novel pur-
pose, it may be susceptible to chal-
lenges in the courts. If the Court con-
tinues to shift in this direction, it will 
have consequences for Federal legisla-
tion beyond the ACA. As a result, 
Congress’s authority to robustly ad-
dress climate change, civil rights, new 
technology, and other national chal-
lenges through legislation could be sty-
mied or diminished over time. 
And with Judge Barrett’s fascination 
with the exact meaning of the original 
writers of the Constitution, I wonder 
what their thoughts were about nu-
clear energy, satellites in space, a U.S. 
Air Force, which was not specifically 
authorized in the Constitution. I think 
we will find ourselves in a very dif-
ficult position where when we face the 
challenges of climate change, cyber 
warfare, that a Court that looks back 
will not grant Congress the authority 
to protect the American people. 
Also limiting the authority of the 
Federal Government, a 6-to-3 conserv-
ative majority could take on a more 
aggressive judicial review of agency ac-
tions. Several members of the Supreme 
Court have already called for the re-
consideration of the Chevron decision. 
This is a legal doctrine that instructs 
the Federal judiciary to defer to a Fed-
eral agency’s reasonable interpretation 
of an ambiguous or unclear statute 
that it administers. 
If the Supreme Court overturns the 
Chevron deference, it could strike down 
agency rules that do not comport with 
the Court’s interpretation of the stat-
ute. This could make toothless envi-
ronmental, food and drug safety, labor, 
and a host of other regulations enacted 
for the benefit of the workers and con-
sumers. It would also shift the Court’s 
decisions in favor of the corporate and

special interests that tend to challenge 
these agency regulations in the first 
place. 
One of reasons that the agencies were 
given the authority to implement our 
laws—given by Congress to the agen-
cies—was their expertise, an expertise 
that in most cases far exceeds that of 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Now, I intend to vote against the 
nomination of Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett to be an Associate Justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court because I am con-
vinced that she will not guard core 
constitutional principles, that she will 
not interpret the law to protect the 
rights of the vulnerable, and that she 
will read the law with a backward- 
looking perspective, not consistent 
with the realities of our time and the 
growing dangers that we face in the fu-
ture. 
As my Republican colleagues accel-
erate this nomination at a breakneck 
pace, it speaks to the deeply misplaced 
priorities of this body. We simply 
should be not be undertaking a Su-
preme Court nomination at this time, 
especially when it should rightfully 
take place during the next Presidential 
term after the voters have made their 
decision. 
The Senate’s foremost priority right 
now should be to provide additional 
pandemic relief. My colleagues have 
displayed a profound lack of urgency to 
address the many challenges Ameri-
cans face due to the pandemic. This is 
despite the repeated warnings from 
public health experts and economists 
about what will happen if we do not 
enact additional fiscal aid. 
However, my Republican colleagues 
continue to turn a blind eye, even as 
COVID–19 cases spike, businesses close, 
unemployment 
remains 
high, 
and 
States consider deeper budget cuts. 
Under 
these 
extraordinary 
cir-
cumstances, I cannot support Judge 
Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme 
the Court of the United States. 
I urge my Republican colleagues to 
stop this shortsighted rush. Let’s put 
the best interests of the country first. 
Let’s wait a few more days and let the 
American people have a say. Let’s 
focus on the COVID–19 crisis, which de-
mands our immediate attention. Just 
because you can do something doesn’t 
mean you are doing the right thing. I 
strongly believe my Republican col-
leagues are making a major mistake 
that will be doing lasting damage to 
both this institution and the Supreme 
Court, and I urge them to reconsider. 
Instead of pushing forward with this 
ill-suited nominee, let’s get to the busi-
ness at hand: addressing the great chal-
lenges we face due to the pandemic and 
beyond, as well as working together to 
fix the Senate so that we no longer 
break faith with the people who sent us 
here, the people we represent. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
COLORADO WILDFIRES 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, before I 
begin my remarks about the nomina-
tion, I want to acknowledge that to-
night, as we are here, there are fires in 
many places across the State of Colo-
rado. There are people who are out of 
their homes and out of their commu-
nities, who have had to evacuate their 
towns, and there are first responders on 
the ground in Colorado who are fight-
ing these fires bravely every single 
day. 
They have been stretched all summer 
through a fire season that has lasted 
into the fall because of our inability to 
deal with our forests and because of cli-
mate change. My hope tonight, as we 
are here, is that the snow that has fall-
en is going to be more of a benefit than 
a curse to everybody who is out there. 
So, with that, I thank the Presiding 
Officer for recognizing me, and I will 
now give my remarks about this con-
firmation. 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY BARRETT 
Mr. President, when I was in law 
school, which wasn’t really that long 
ago, the confirmation of a Supreme 
Court Justice was a chance for the 
American people to learn about our 
system of checks and balances, our 
commitment to the rule of law, and, in 
particular, the independence of judges. 
And whenever the Senate confirmed a 
Justice with an overwhelming bipar-
tisan vote, as it did almost every time, 
it reaffirmed that independence and re-
assured the American people that our 
courts were protected from political in-
fluence and that they stood apart from 
the partisanship of the other two 
branches of government. 
As we meet here tonight, after 20 
years of descending into intensifying 
partisanship in the confirmation of 
judges, the Senate is now about to drag 
the Supreme Court down to its own 
decadent level by turning it into just 
another politicized body that is dis-
trusted, for good reason, by the people 
it is meant to serve. 
It is common these days to observe 
that our institutions are failing. I have 
said it myself. But institutions don’t 
fail on their own. They can’t destroy 
themselves. It takes people to destroy 
them. It particularly takes leaders who 
have no inclusive, long-range vision for 
our country or our democracy; leaders 
who can’t or won’t think beyond nar-
row, short-term interests; and leaders, 
I am sorry to say, like Leader MCCON-
NELL. 
He may imagine, as he claims, that 
he is simply restoring the judicial cal-
endar to a prefilibuster era. That is 
what he tells his colleagues here when 
he recounts the story. The majority 
leader, more than any other actor, has 
transformed what used to be the over-
whelming bipartisan confirmation of a 
qualified nominee and a bipartisan 
ratification of the independence of the 
judiciary into an entirely partisan ex-
ercise that has destroyed the Senate’s 
constitutional responsibility to advise 
and consent and is now at risk of de-
stroying the credibility of the Supreme 
Court and the lower courts as well. 
This may not matter much, I sup-
pose, to the Senators on this floor. It 
matters to the American people who 
have not consented to the destruction 
of their constitutional right to an inde-
pendent judiciary free from the par-
tisan insanity of elected politicians. 
In this confirmation proceeding, the 
majority renounced its duty to advise 
and consent by giving their consent be-
fore the President ever chose the nomi-
nee. I don’t believe that has ever hap-
pened in the history of America. 
Ours is a Senate where words have 
lost their meaning. Party advantage 
dictates every action. Shameless hy-
pocrisy is the stuff of proud triumph. 
Deliberation is no longer necessary be-
cause conclusions are all foregone, and 
a decision like that affirming Judge 
Barrett to a lifetime appointment to 
the most powerful Court in the Nation 
is anything you have the power to 
cram down the throats of your political 
opponents. 
The truth is, this confirmation proc-
ess has never been a debate about what 
the Senate should do, what the Senate 
ought to do, and what the right thing 
to do for this Senate is. It has always 
been a demonstration of what the ma-
jority can get away with and of how 
they can exercise their power in order 
to entrench their power. 
I have no expectation that my words 
are going to change the result tomor-
row. My hope is that we can mark this 
as the moment that the American peo-
ple said ‘‘Enough’’ and began to re-
claim their exercise in self-government 
from those who have worked relent-
lessly to deprive them of it. 
To do that, we have to be very clear 
about what this moment means and 
what it calls on each of us to do in the 
days, months, and years ahead. The 
truth is, this confirmation is the latest 
victory for an unpatriotic project that 
traces back to the earliest days of our 
country. 
Since our founding, there have al-
ways been factions working toward an 
insidious purpose: to so degrade and 
discredit our national exercise in self- 
government that when the American 
people finally throw up their hands in 
disgust, these factions can distort it 
into an instrument for their interests 
instead of the public interest. 
Today, the Senate majority leader, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, represents one such 
faction, joined by the Freedom Caucus 
in the House of Representatives, Presi-
dent Trump, and the legion of deep- 
pocketed donors and PACs assembled 
behind them. Because factions like this 
one have a tough time winning broad 
support from the American people for 
their agenda, they seek other less

democratic 
means 
to 
secure 
their 
power—gerrymandering, voter suppres-
sion, and, in this case, cramming a 
nominee onto the Supreme Court dur-
ing the fleeting days of a failing, un-
popular administration. 
Over the years, earlier versions of 
these factions have obscured their 
project 
with 
terms 
like 
‘‘States’ 
rights,’’ ‘‘originalism,’’ ‘‘freedom,’’ and 
with dubious claims like ‘‘separate but 
equal,’’ essentially turning American 
words against the American people. 
We saw it in the 1890s, when the Su-
preme Court invoked freedom to strike 
down laws that would have let workers 
unionize, establish a minimum wage, 
prohibit child labor, and create a pro-
gressive income tax. We saw it most in-
famously in Plessy v. Ferguson, when 
the same Court hid behind equality to 
justify segregation. 
We saw it in 1905, when the Supreme 
Court perverted the 14th Amendment, 
the amendment meant to guarantee 
the protection of the law for those 
most vulnerable in our society, to in-
vent a ‘‘liberty to contract’’ so that 
bakeries could freely force people to 
work more than 60 hours a week. Just 
a few years after that ruling, 145 work-
ers were burned alive at the Triangle 
Shirtwaist Factory after their em-
ployer took the liberty of locking them 
inside. 
We saw it in the 1930s, when the Su-
preme Court rewrote the commerce 
clause in a failed attempt to eviscerate 
the New Deal, FDR’s historic effort to 
build an economy that lifted everyone 
up, not just those at the very top. 
We see it in our time, in Citizens 
United, Shelby, and other rulings when 
the Supreme Court has asserted the 
right of billionaires and other privi-
leged interests to corrupt our democ-
racy, while denying the American peo-
ple’s right to defend it. 
And we see it in Judge Barrett’s ad-
herence to originalism, the spurious 
legal doctrine that has been knocking 
around in the Federalist Society and 
other circles of far-right lawyers since 
the 1970s. By claiming to stick to an 
18th century understanding of the Con-
stitution, originalism deceptively im-
plicates Madison, Hamilton, and the 
rest of the Framers in any number of 
legal arguments, as if they intended 
the Second Amendment to permit 
bump stocks or the interstate com-
merce clause to forbid environmental 
protections while foreclosing on legis-
lative innovation here and now in the 
present because the men who gathered 
in Philadelphia to draft the Constitu-
tion, who could not recognize that 
slavery should be outlawed or that 
women should have the right to vote, 
could also not foresee the need to pro-
hibit child labor or require food labels 
to tell the truth. 
It is no surprise to me that the 
originalists and the tea party-right 
have embraced shared hagiographies. 
They are stealing the authority of the 
Founders in an effort to conceal their 
reactionary project. And while the spe-
cific aims of these factions have 
changed over time, their project has re-
mained the same: to protect their 
power and call it freedom—freedom to 
enslave, freedom to segregate, freedom 
to pay workers less than they can live 
on, to work them to death, to fire them 
because of what they believe or whom 
they love, to redline our neighbor-
hoods, poison our skies, defund our 
schools, and buy our elections. 
At all times, though, their goal has 
been to preserve, as Professor Jefferson 
Cowie puts it, the freedom to dominate 
others—not only to cement their power 
but to demolish the economic oppor-
tunity and civil rights that would oth-
erwise empower their fellow Ameri-
cans. 
Why would they do this? Because, in 
truth, the original promise of Amer-
ica—that it would be a society in which 
all people would be created equal and 
endowed with equal rights—terrifies 
them. 
The consequences for our country 
and for its citizens who do not benefit 
from this project are plain. It batters 
our political and economic equity, se-
curity, and opportunity. It degrades 
our democracy. It robs from future 
American 
generations 
by 
hoarding 
wealth today. This confirmation is 
their latest ill-gotten victory. 
Judge Barrett’s nomination comes to 
this floor on a path cleared by the 
same deep-pocketed donors and cor-
porations that have worked for decades 
to protect their power, regardless of 
the cost to the American people and 
their security, well-being, and civil 
rights. And based on everything I have 
learned about Judge Barrett’s record, I 
fear she will become one more predict-
able vote for that agenda. 
In her tenure on the Seventh Circuit, 
Judge Barrett sided with corporations 
in 85 percent of her business-related 
cases. She sided with employers ac-
cused of discriminating by race. She 
sided with employers accused of dis-
criminating by age. She sided with 
debt collectors over consumers. She 
voted to block compensation for vic-
tims of a compensation fund. She voted 
against workers’ fight for overtime. 
The pattern is clear: When consumers 
and workers sought the protection of 
the law or the government, she stood 
in the way. I worry that, once con-
firmed, she will continue that pattern 
with rulings to destroy hard-won pro-
tections for the American people—rul-
ings to cripple agencies to keep our air 
and water clean, our food and drugs 
safe, and our families protected from 
scammers trying to rip them off; rul-
ings to make it harder for Americans 
to choose how and when to raise a fam-
ily or marry the person they love; rul-
ings to make it easier for felons to buy 
guns 
and 
harder 
for 
us 
to 
hold 
gunmakers accountable when their 
weapons kill and maim our children in 
their schools and on our streets; rul-
ings to block any effort by the Amer-
ican people to fight the voter suppres-
sion, to fight the dark money, and the 
partisan 
gerrymandering 
corrupting 
our democracy. 
Finally, I worry that she will cast 
the deciding vote to destroy the Afford-
able Care Act and strip healthcare 
from millions of people in Colorado and 
across the country for whom this is lit-
erally a matter of life and death. 
Justice Barrett’s confirmation will 
cement a 6-to-3 majority on the Court 
that will allow the powerful to do what 
they want, while standing against the 
American people’s efforts to protect 
one another, to support one another, 
and to invest in each other through our 
democracy. That is where we are. That 
is where we are. 
As dispiriting as this moment may 
be, we have been here before as a coun-
try. We are not the first generation of 
Americans to face the Senate or a Su-
preme Court that will stand with the 
powerful against the people. We are not 
the first citizens to run into a wall of 
obstruction as we work to make this 
country more democratic, more fair, 
and more free. 
We have to learn from the examples 
of those who came before us, those who 
answered slavery with emancipation 
and reconstruction; a Gilded Age with 
a Progressive Era; a Great Depression 
with a New Deal; Jim Crow with civil 
rights. As it was for them, so it is for 
us to meet the challenges of our time. 
And 
unlike 
the 
forces 
that 
have 
brought us to this low point, we have a 
much harder job because we have a far 
greater purpose. 
Theirs has been to grind our democ-
racy into rubble; ours is to build a 
strong foundation for the American 
people and the next generation. 
The American people need us to 
begin building that foundation now. 
They have already paid enough for a 
government that fails to fight on their 
behalf—50 years, when 90 percent of 
families haven’t had a pay raise; the 
worst income inequality since 1928; 
people working harder and harder than 
ever before but whose families are slid-
ing farther away from the middle class, 
and now—and now—a national govern-
ment paralyzed by ineptitude, incom-
petence, indifference, and basic sci-
entific ignorance that has led to thou-
sands of needless deaths of our fellow 
citizens and pushed millions of families 
and businesses over the brink. 
We must end this era and replace it 
with more honorable commitment to 
competent and imaginative self-gov-
ernment responsive to the American 
people’s needs. 
Their wishes are more than fair. 
They want a wage they can live on, a 
healthcare system that no longer rou-
tinely reduces families to tears, with 
options they can actually afford and 
count on when they need them, schools 
that create possibility and opportunity 
and colleges that leave students with 
more than just crippling debt; the 
chance to care for a new child or a sick 
family member without having to quit 
a job or lose their pay, safe commu-
nities where parents no longer have to

worry about their kids being shot, 
criminal justice and law enforcement 
and immigration systems that don’t 
treat people differently because of the 
color of their skin, roads and bridges 
and airports that weren’t built by their 
grandparents, broadband that works at 
home so kids don’t have to go to school 
in Walmart parking lots in this coun-
try tonight, an urgent and durable an-
swer for climate change so the next 
generation doesn’t inherit a planet 
hurtling toward incineration. 
None of this is unreasonable; all of it 
is achievable; and we can start with 
the coming elections. But that is only 
the beginning of the fight. 
I can assure you that the same fac-
tion that was willing to enlist every 
parliamentary gimmick or deploy any 
oratorical sleight of hand or commit 
any act of institutional arson in serv-
ice of someone like Donald Trump will 
continue to do whatever they can get 
away with in this body. 
They are not going to stop. They 
have spent decades and billions in dark 
money, exercising their power to en-
trench their power. 
They will not abandon this project in 
a single election. And we are going to 
have to overcome that, just as we are 
going to have to overcome the Supreme 
Court. It won’t be easy. It won’t be 
easy, but anyone who studied the his-
tory of our country, our democracy, 
knows how hard it is to make progress. 
It is never easy. 
Time and again, Americans have 
breached the ramparts of undemocratic 
power. It happened in 1848 in Seneca 
Falls, 
when 
100 
people—mostly 
women—signed the Declaration of Sen-
timents. 
It 
happened 
outside 
the 
Stonewall Inn in 1969, when thousands 
stood up to police abuse of the city’s 
LGBT citizens. It happened when Cesar 
Chavez lifted the plight of America’s 
farmworkers and Corky Gonzalez gave 
voice to the history and stifled pride of 
a people. It happened in 1965, when 2,500 
citizens crossed the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge on the way to the Alabama cap-
ital city of Montgomery. 
Each time a few brave citizens have 
advanced upon the work of despotism, 
their fellow Americans joining them, 
because they, too, longed for a better 
country. 
Perhaps this summer we crossed this 
generation’s Edmund Pettus Bridge, 
when 
fatigued 
by 
still 
unending 
months of disease, ashamed by Donald 
Trump’s embrace of White supremacy 
and his failing efforts to make the 
United States look like a police state, 
forced to reckon again with the brutal 
and systemic racism of our justice and 
law enforcement system, Americans 
decided they could no longer stand a 
country on such terrible terms, or per-
haps this generation’s Edmund Pettus 
Bridge is still before us, unknown but 
there for those who will do their part 
to bend the moral arc of the universe. 
But we must cross this bridge I hope 
sooner rather than later. 
Like our forebearers, we will cross it 
only by pursuing ideas so compelling 
that Americans will fight for them to 
make a real difference in their lives. 
As always, our march won’t begin in 
the Chamber of the Senate. But when 
Dr. King, John Lewis, and the many 
who joined them, crossed their genera-
tion’s bridge, the Senate eventually 
followed and broke the segregationist 
stranglehold on this body. 
Rather than turn his back on what 
was obviously right, the Republican 
leader, joined his Democratic counter-
part, Mike Mansfield, to lock arms in 
support of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. The segregationist filibuster with-
ered in the face of noble, bipartisan 
majorities. 
When our time comes once again in 
the Senate to cross the Edmund Pettus 
Bridge, we will have to muster the dis-
cipline to stand behind an agenda that 
will endure, one sturdy enough for a 
project of our own. And if we do our 
job, my hope is that 50 years from now, 
our kids and grandkids will look back 
with gratitude that we built on this 
foundation a house that they and their 
children love to live in—an America 
that is more democratic, more fair, and 
more free. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, two 
powerful phrases we often hear in 
America: one is ‘‘We the People,’’ an-
other is ‘‘equal justice under law.’’ 
‘‘We the People,’’ the first three 
words of the Constitution, written in 
supersized script so that everyone 
could have no doubt that that is what 
that Constitution—our Constitution— 
was all about. You can see those words 
from across the room. They echo so 
often, how can we possibly forget the 
soul of our Constitution is, as Presi-
dent Lincoln described, ‘‘of, by, and for 
the people’’—‘‘of, by, and for the peo-
ple.’’ 
That second phrase, ‘‘equal justice 
under law’’—a phrase so important to 
our system that it is carved above the 
doors of the Supreme Court. Just the 
across the hallway here from the 
Chamber in which I now stand, the 
Senate Chamber, you can go into the 
Johnson Room. It served, when John-
son was the majority leader of this 
Chamber, as his office. And you look 
out the window, you can see the Su-
preme Court Building with that phrase 
carved into it: ‘‘Equal Justice Under 
Law’’—two 
powerful 
phrases 
that, 
taken together, lay out the foundation 
for our democratic Republic. 
They also represent a vision that is 
aspirational—one that we had not 
achieved when our Constitution was 
first written, one that we have not 
achieved yet today but that we work 
toward, we strive toward, generation 
after generation, knowing that, in our 
hearts, that is what we wish to 
achieve—a nation where everyone is 
created equal, in which everyone is af-
forded the same rights and privileges, 
they are all treated equally, have the 
full measure of opportunity to pursue 
their life ambitions. 
Today, this evening, we are consid-
ering, in this final 30 hours of debate, a 
nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court 
for a person who will wear one of those 
nine black robes and sit in that Su-
preme Court Chamber across the plaza 
from where we now stand, a person who 
will sit in a Chamber behind the doors 
with ‘‘Equal Justice Under Law’’ in-
scribed. 
But instead of making a stride to-
ward that vision of ‘‘equal justice 
under law,’’ instead of making a stride 
toward that vision of government of, 
by, and for the people, this nomination 
imperils that vision. This nominee, if 
confirmed, will damage that vision. 
We have a decades-long scheme by a 
powerful and privileged minority to de-
stroy the ‘‘we the people’’ vision of 
equality and opportunity in our Con-
stitution, to erode the foundation of 
our institutions so that they can rig 
the system in their favor. 
This has always been a dynamic of 
republics—those who love that vision 
of a government ‘‘of, by, and for the 
people’’ and those who fear that vision 
of government ‘‘of, by, and for the peo-
ple’’ because they want to rig the rules 
in their favor. They want to rig the 
rules with a vision that would never 
have a chance at the ballot box, that 
would never be embraced by the major-
ity. They want to pull the levers of 
power from behind the scenes in their 
own favor, to accentuate income in-
equality, to accentuate wealth inequal-
ity, to prevent those people from vot-
ing who disagree with them with every 
type of contrivance to suppress and in-
timidate voters. 
If there is anything in which freedom 
of speech has meaning, isn’t it that 
speech that you make when you mark 
your ballot for whom you wish to be 
your representative—perhaps the most 
powerful moment of expression in a re-
public. 
Judge Amy Coney Barrett, the nomi-
nee, is certainly not the architect of 
this scheme, but she is certainly a full- 
fledged partner, enthusiastically em-
bracing The Federalist Society and its 
mission to thwart the will of the people 
of the United States of America. 
She doesn’t read those first three 
words of the Constitution—‘‘We the 
People’’—as meaning government of, 
by, and for the people; she reads it as 
we, the powerful, will decide what is 
best for ourselves and everyone else; 
thank you very much. Boy, talk about 
a philosophy that undermines the in-
tegrity of our Constitution. That is it. 
And she is just one of a stream of ju-
rists rushed through in the last 4 years, 
organized by the Federalist Society, to

further undermine the rights of the 
worker, to undermine the civil rights 
of Americans, to undermine healthcare 
rights, to undermine environmental 
laws. It is an agenda that is the exact 
opposite of the vision of our Constitu-
tion. 
And here we have the Members of the 
majority of this Chamber, facilitating 
this scheme. They stand determined to 
shatter any norm, to destroy any 
precedent, to break any rule that 
stands in the way, to abandon any prin-
ciple they so recently passionately pro-
claimed in their single-minded grab for 
power, this single-minded mission of 
stacking the court with extreme right-
wing jurists for the powerful over the 
people—jurists who, rather than stand-
ing firm in defense of the Constitution, 
will use those black robes for the dark, 
dark deed of destroying any pretense of 
government of, by, and for the people. 
Just 4 years ago the majority of this 
Chamber, the same majority, the Re-
publican majority, said they had dis-
covered a new principle that they felt 
with all their hearts was the right 
thing to do; that never, under any con-
dition, under any set of circumstances 
should this Chamber ever debate or 
vote on a nominee for the Supreme 
Court during an election year. 
They made that argument though 
the election was far away. The vacancy 
occurred early in the year. The nomi-
nee was named by the President, Presi-
dent Obama, in March. But that dis-
tant election on the horizon, we have 
to protect it, and we should hear from 
the people before we decide to debate 
and vote. 
You know, it is disturbing to see a 
so-called deeply held principle vaporize 
like light rain on hot summer asphalt. 
It is disturbing to see a so-called deep-
ly held principle be so easily acquired 
when it violates the precedents of this 
Nation and so easily abandoned when it 
is convenient to do so. 
There is just one principle here. It is 
the principle of power. It is the prin-
ciple of ‘‘we will because we can.’’ It is 
the principle that we have no principle; 
we will toss our integrity to the winds; 
we will trash our arguments of yester-
year; we will forget the speeches in 
which we so passionately proclaimed 
our positions because we have a mo-
ment of opportunity to advance power 
for the powerful, and we will seize it. 
What is different between this year 
and 4 years ago when the majority said 
there should never, under any cir-
cumstances, ever be a debate on a Pres-
idential nominee during an election 
year? What is different? 
Well, 4 years ago there was a va-
cancy. This year there is a vacancy. 
Four years ago it was an election year, 
a Presidential election year. This year 
it is a Presidential election year. 
It is the same choice of whether to 
debate or whether to hear from the 
voice of the people before deciding how 
to fill this vacancy. It is the same 
choice, with one difference. That dif-
ference is that 4 years ago the vacancy 
occurred 10 months before the election 
and this year it occurred just a few 
weeks before the election. 
We all recognize that, if one was real-
ly disturbed that this was a conflict, 
that disturbance would be much great-
er this year when there is no time, so 
little time—just weeks. In fact, it is 
not really weeks before the election be-
cause the election is underway. Fifty 
million Americans have already voted. 
So it is not just a year of an election; 
it is during an election. 
I would love to see an outbreak of in-
tegrity in this Chamber, an outbreak of 
principle in defense of our Constitu-
tion. It is so often that we admire char-
acter. We admire it when someone says 
‘‘That person is as good as their word.’’ 
I would like to be able to say that, 
when I heard my colleagues say they 
had a passionately, deeply held prin-
ciple 4 years ago that there should be 
no debate in an election year, they 
were as good as their word. 
That is what we admire: character, 
principle. We all have heard the quote: 
‘‘I disapprove of what you say, but I 
will defend to the death your right to 
say it.’’ It is a quote attributed to Vol-
taire by Beatrice Evelyn Hall. It was 
actually 
more 
a 
description 
of 
Voltaire’s character, that he believed 
in a principle so firmly that, even when 
it disadvantaged him, to his point of 
death, he would defend it. 
Who in this Chamber argued 4 years 
ago that during an election year there 
should be no debate or vote on a nomi-
nee and has that Voltairean character 
to defend it when it is inconvenient 
today—not even inconvenient to the 
point of death, just inconvenient be-
cause of some pressure you might re-
ceive politically? Who will stand up 
and be that voice of character in this 
Chamber? 
We all await to see just a few people 
stand up and be a voice of principle in 
this Chamber. We all stand here and 
wait for just a few people to be a voice 
of integrity in this Chamber. The coun-
try waits for a position that can be ad-
mired, of principle, of character, and of 
integrity. 
It is not just that passionate argu-
ment 4 years ago; it is also about 
breaking the rules. Just the other day, 
the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee broke the committee rule that 
at least 2 members of the minority 
needed to be present for a quorum to 
advance Judge Barrett’s nomination. 
And he broke another rule to close de-
bate that says there has to be a minor-
ity member present. 
Well, why don’t you just stand up and 
tear up the rules of the committee? 
The Parliamentarian of this body said 
that is OK—that is OK. So apparently 
there are no real rules to what happens 
here under this majority. 
What is the end goal of this effort to 
break the norms, break the rules, 
break the passionate principles pro-
nounced 4 years ago? Certainly not to 
ensure equal justice under law, cer-
tainly not to embody ‘‘We the People’’ 
governments, certainly not because 
there is a precedent for this action. 
Oh, wait. I was standing here the 
other day, and I heard a Member say: 
We stand on precedent. 
Well, we are under our 45th Presi-
dent, although some say it is the 44th 
because Cleveland was elected twice— 
in 1884 and then out of office and back 
in 1892. But anyway, we are under—we 
say it is our 45th President—President 
Trump. 
Under our first 43 Presidents, this 
Senate never once—never once—not a 
single time, refused to debate and vote 
on a nominee from the President of the 
United States for the Supreme Court— 
not once. But 4 years ago, under our 
44th President, the Republican major-
ity said: We are breaking that prece-
dent, and for the first time in U.S. his-
tory, we are refusing to debate and 
vote. 
Now, I would have had some respect 
for saying that we will debate and we 
will vote, because that is our responsi-
bility under the Constitution. In fact, 
many times in our history we have de-
bated here in the Senate, and we have 
voted, and we have struck down the 
nominee. 
I was surprised to see that almost a 
quarter of the time—almost one out of 
four nominees has been turned down by 
this Chamber for the Supreme Court. 
That would have involved actually 
being here on the floor and making ar-
guments. That would involve actually 
taking a vote so you could be evalu-
ated, so your position could be evalu-
ated by your constituents. That would 
have involved fulfilling your respon-
sibilities and having the accountability 
that goes with fulfillment of those re-
sponsibilities. 
But there was no fulfillment of re-
sponsibilities 4 years ago. There was no 
accountability because there was no 
vote taken—the first time in U.S. his-
tory. So don’t tell me—don’t tell me, 
colleagues—that you stand on prece-
dent. 
Or we can look back in history to a 
Republican President, President Lin-
coln. President Lincoln was concerned 
about filling a Supreme Court position 
during an election, so what did Presi-
dent Lincoln do? He delayed the nomi-
nation until after the election. How 
about that precedent? How about the 
Republican majority follow the prece-
dent from President Lincoln? 
And then there is the McConnell 
precedent. What is the McConnell 
precedent that he put forward 4 years 
ago? We never vote or debate a nomi-
nee during an election year. How about 
that precedent? 
So precedent after precedent after 
precedent: The historical, centuries- 
long precedent of never failing to de-
bate and vote—broken. The Lincoln 
precedent of not asking the Senate to 
do a nominee’s hearing, debate, and 
vote during an election—broken. The 
McConnell precedent put forward with 
great passion 4 years ago—broken.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6487 
October 25, 2020 
The goal is to transform the Supreme 
Court into a supermajority, a super-
legislature for the superelite—a 6-to-3 
supermajority 
and 
a 
nine-member 
superlegislature 
operating 
for 
the 
superelite. 
That whole vision in our Constitu-
tion of having a Supreme Court that 
defends the rights of Americans from 
the excesses of law written by Congress 
or the excesses of the executive branch 
not following the laws, that is gone. 
This is not about nine referees in black 
robes. This is about having a super-
majority in Republican robes for the 
superelite of this country. 
Why is that such an important strat-
egy for my Republican colleagues? Be-
cause the superelite understands some-
thing fundamental, which is that some-
times the people of the United States 
have a grassroots movement, and they, 
holding the Constitution near and dear 
in their heart, holding their freedoms 
near and dear to their heart, rise up 
against 
this 
manipulation 
by 
the 
superelite, and they pass laws to pro-
tect civil rights. They put forward a vi-
sion of protecting the environment. 
They say workers have to be treated 
fairly—a fair day’s wage for a fair day’s 
work. And the superelite doesn’t like 
that. 
But do you know what? If they can 
turn the Supreme Court into a super-
legislature they control, they don’t 
have to worry about it because they 
can have the laws written by that nine- 
member Court. They can pull the le-
vers of power through the Court. And 
the Court doesn’t have to stand for 
election ever—lifetime. It is done. It is 
locked in. That is the strategy, the 
very successful strategy, to undermine 
the vision of our Constitution. 
That superelite, with their super-
majority of the nine-member super-
legislature, they can stand in the way 
of efforts to save our planet from cli-
mate chaos. They can stand in the way 
of tackling rampant economic inequal-
ity. They can stand in the way of tak-
ing on systemic racism and oppor-
tunity for everyone, regardless of the 
color of their skin. They can stand in 
the way of equality of opportunity for 
LGBTQ communities. They can stand 
in the way of security and integrity for 
our elections. 
They can tear down the work done. 
When these two Chambers, the House 
and the Senate, are mobilized to fight 
for the vision of our Constitution—pur-
suit of happiness, fair opportunity— 
they can strike it down. They can 
strike 
down 
healthcare. 
They 
can 
strike down reproductive rights. 
Perhaps the most diabolical part is 
their effort to destroy the integrity of 
our election system. Now, one form of 
assault on the integrity is gerry-
mandering, where States draw the lines 
in order to favor a particular party. 
This has been done in States controlled 
by Democrats as well as States con-
trolled by Republicans. 
When the analysis is done across the 
country, when it comes to Representa-
tives in the Chamber down the hall, the 
House of Representatives, political sci-
entists estimate that it creates a 15- to 
20-seat bias in favor of the Repub-
licans—15 to 20 seats. That is a big deal 
in the House of Representatives. 
It certainly, in terms of equal rep-
resentation, is simply wrong because it 
is unequal representation. But the Su-
preme Court decided it was OK. They 
decided it was all right. 
Or we can talk about the Voting 
Rights Act, designed specifically to 
stop tactics to suppress voting or to in-
timidate voters, because isn’t voting 
the foundation of our electoral system? 
Isn’t it the foundation of our demo-
cratic republic? 
But in 2013, in a 5-to-4 decision, the 
five Justices in red robes gutted the 
Voting Rights Act to unleash voting 
suppression and intimidation across 
our country, and we see the results in 
county after county after county. 
We see it in State after State after 
State. Here is the thing: Before the Su-
preme Court struck down the protec-
tion of the integrity of voting, we had 
a bipartisan majority—a large, exten-
sive, huge bipartisan majority—in de-
fense of election integrity in this 
Chamber. But once the Court struck it 
down and it massively favored one 
party over the other, the Republicans 
abandoned their principles on this and 
have blocked every effort to restore 
protection of voting integrity in our 
Nation. 
We can look at the impact of money 
from corporations on elections. In Citi-
zens United, 10 years ago, the Court de-
cided that we need to give the ultimate 
source of massive power, ultimate in-
fluence on elections by freeing them up 
to put as much money into campaigns 
as they should like. So if a corpora-
tion—if I offend them, and I offend 
them all the time—chooses that they 
can put $100 million into campaigning 
against me in my State, it is like a sta-
dium sound system designed to drown 
out the voice of the people. 
Imagine you are at a ball game. You 
are there in the stadium, with all your 
community members, and you are try-
ing to make your voice heard. Every-
one should get a fair chance to have 
their voice heard. But the big speakers 
above you drown you out. That is Citi-
zens United. It doesn’t facilitate speech 
in the town square; it suppresses 
speech in the town square. It drowns 
out speech in the town square. 
It is as if our Founders had said: We 
want everyone to have a chance to 
stand up and take their position, make 
it known in the town square, before the 
election is held for the mayor but 
thought it would be OK if a corporation 
bought the town square and prevented 
anyone else from speaking. That is 
Citizens United. That is the grotesque 
violation of free speech in America 
done by five jurists in red robes for the 
superelite. 
That is a pretty good deal for the fos-
sil fuel megapolluters. Our entire plan-
et is at risk. They want to eliminate 
all the restrictions, regulations—the 
freedom to pollute—even though they 
know the people of this country really 
value clean air and clean water. So 
control the courts so they can strike 
down those rules to protect our air and 
our water. 
There are many challenges involved 
in the revenue to support our country. 
I mention this because it is another 
reason the superelite want a super-
majority in the nine-member super-
legislature. It is because the rich don’t 
want to pay for the infrastructure of 
this country. 
Leona Helmsley once said that only 
the little people pay taxes. President 
Trump has said things very close to 
that. Very wealthy people have a lot of 
enterprises 
going 
on. 
Corporations 
have a lot of enterprises going on. They 
are using our legal system continu-
ously, but they don’t want to pay for 
it. They are using our transportation 
system continuously, but they don’t 
want to pay for it. They are benefiting 
by hiring the products of our education 
system, but they don’t want to pay for 
it. 
Leona Helmsley said it well: For the 
superelite, only the little people pay 
taxes. That is the philosophy supported 
in this effort to control the courts. 
Big banks like this. They want to 
make sure that there is not an uprising 
in the people that says you have to 
shut down that Wall Street casino that 
prevents us from putting the entire 
American economy at risk. They want 
to keep that casino in place. Compa-
nies that are trying to maximize prof-
its and stock values certainly don’t 
like laws that protect workers’ rights 
and protections. 
There are many ways the superelite 
can pull the levers of power from be-
hind the scene. Hundreds of lawyers— 
that is very valuable. Hundreds of lob-
byists work on Capitol Hill. There are 
far more lobbyists for the drug indus-
try up here than there are Members of 
Congress. Media campaigns to influ-
ence public opinion cost a lot of 
money; that is another power. Think 
tanks generate ideas that can move the 
conversation in their direction. Of 
course, the money in elections is abso-
lutely key. But the courts—the courts 
are the final defense against the peo-
ple. If you can control the courts—who 
aren’t elected, who are invulnerable to 
the people—that is your final defense. 
At the heart of this court strategy is 
the Federalist Society, organized in 
the 1980s. They put high ideals on their 
website, saying they are ‘‘founded on 
the principles that the state exists to 
preserve freedom, that the separation 
of governmental powers is central to 
our Constitution.’’ 
It sounds pretty good. ‘‘Preserve free-
dom.’’ It is innocuous. But it is not 
about preserving freedom. That is the 
media strategy. It is about crushing 
the freedom of ordinary people to par-
ticipate in our elections. It is about 
crushing the ability of ordinary people 
to get a fair day’s pay. It is not about

the separation of powers. They want 
the majority in the Senate to work to 
create a majority in the Court, closely 
connected to each other in this web of 
the powerful pulling the levers behind 
the scenes—the opposite of separation 
of powers. 
As described in the book, ‘‘The Lie 
that Binds,’’ the Federalist Society 
sprang up to implement an anti-demo-
cratic policy agenda and political phi-
losophy—a court system impervious to 
the will of the voters. That superelite— 
they realized long ago the powers and 
initiatives they wanted were not going 
to be popular—and thus this strategy, 
this strategy relevant to this confirma-
tion. 
The Federalist Society has been 
funded by that same group and ex-
panded into a behemoth, with some 
70,000 attorneys. It started in no small 
part by a grant received from the Olin 
Foundation, a conservative grant-mak-
ing foundation that was the force be-
hind business friendly law and econom-
ics at law schools throughout the coun-
try. 
I have heard people say: Do you know 
what? I joined because they had the 
money to buy us dinner, and I was a 
poor law student. 
According to the New York Observer, 
the Olin Foundation gave out hundreds 
of millions of dollars in grants ‘‘to con-
servative think tanks and intellec-
tuals—the architects of today’s sprawl-
ing right-wing movement—for a quar-
ter century.’’ 
The crown jewel of the Olin Founda-
tion’s work? The Federalist Society. 
The Olin Foundation wrote to its trust-
ees in 2003: ‘‘All in all, the Federalist 
Society has been one of the best invest-
ments the foundation ever made.’’ 
Since its founding, the Federalist So-
ciety has put forward extreme, right-
wing legal theories. And as their influ-
ence and power have grown, they have 
worked hard to bring those theories 
into the mainstream—mainstream ar-
guments, like originalism, which Judge 
Barrett, 
the 
late 
Justice 
Antonin 
Scalia, 
Justices 
Kavanaugh 
and 
Gorsuch all claim to hold. 
This is how Judge Barrett explained 
her philosophy during her confirmation 
hearings: ‘‘I interpret the Constitution 
as a law, that I interpret its text as 
text, and I understand it to have the 
meaning that it had at the time people 
ratified it. So that meaning doesn’t 
change over time.’’ 
It is a great cover story. It is a great 
cover story, but it is a cover story. It 
is a cover story for the superelite to 
manipulate America. And it dissolves 
upon any detailed examination. We 
know, if we bother to read history, that 
virtually every clause of the Constitu-
tion had Founders who disagreed on 
what it meant. Yes, you had a pretty 
homogenous 
group—39 
White, 
edu-
cated, wealthy men, signing that piece 
of parchment in Philadelphia, but they 
had multitudinous views of the clauses. 
There is a lot of ambiguity in those 
clauses that enabled them to come to-
gether and say: I can accept that. We 
will argue later over what it meant. 
This originalist philosophy is saying: 
Well, here is the secret. There were a 
bunch of people who had different 
views at the time it was written, but I 
will choose the one meaning that bene-
fits the powerful in America, that fits 
the ‘‘we the powerful’’ vision of our 
Constitution, not the ‘‘We the People.’’ 
That is pretty clever—pretty clever 
and pretty diabolical if, in your heart, 
you care about this Nation, you care 
about the beautiful, extraordinary vi-
sion that we will be a government not 
dedicated to those who are the elite, 
like the kingdoms of Europe, but will 
draw its power from the opinion of the 
people. That is the view I hold. That is 
the view our Founders aspired to. That 
is the view that is being undermined 
day in and day out by the Federalist 
Society. 
Madison wrote: ‘‘No language is so 
copious as to supply words and phrases 
for every complex idea, or so correct as 
to not include many equivocally denot-
ing different ideas.’’ 
He is speaking directly to my point: 
The Founders had many different ideas 
about what each clause of the Con-
stitution meant and what it would 
mean to be applied. 
He went on to write: ‘‘All new laws, 
though penned with the greatest tech-
nical skill . . . are considered as more 
or less obscure and equivocal, until 
their 
meaning 
be 
liquidated 
and 
ascertained by a series of particular 
discussions.’’ 
The words are ‘‘more or less obscure 
and equivocal, until their meaning be 
. . . ascertained by a series of par-
ticular 
discussions’’—again, 
noting 
that the right philosophy is to seek to 
understand the motivation, the prin-
ciple in which those ideas were infused, 
not to cherry-pick one of the many 
conflicting positions in order to sus-
tain power by the powerful. 
We can see this in one of the early 
fights in the history of our United 
States, of our Constitution. The year 
was 1791, just 4 years after the Con-
stitution was written. Treasury Sec-
retary Alexander Hamilton was work-
ing on his financial plan to build up the 
country’s credit, and he wanted Con-
gress to charter a national bank. Ham-
ilton had that goal in position. Madi-
son and Jefferson did not like the idea 
of a national bank. They argued about 
the Constitution. 
Hamilton said that as long as the 
Constitution didn’t specifically say 
that the government couldn’t do some-
thing, it then could do something. And 
the opposite position held by Jefferson 
and Madison was, no, the Constitution 
only allows something to be done if it 
is absolutely necessary to implement 
the enumerated power. 
This argument is over a clause of the 
Constitution called the Necessary and 
Proper Clause. It says that government 
has the ability to enact laws for the 
necessary and proper fulfillment of the 
enumerated responsibilities. 
But Hamilton read that as allowing 
something that is relevant and useful 
to facilitate an enumerated power. It 
would serve the purpose of that enu-
merated power. And Madison and Jef-
ferson said: No, no, no, it only means 
something can be done if it is abso-
lutely essential—not that it is rel-
evant, not that it is useful, but it is ab-
solutely essential to implement the 
enumerated power. 
So one is a very expansive view of 
what is allowed by the Constitution, 
and one is a very constricted view. All 
these men were involved in writing the 
Constitution, all to my point about the 
differing views that were held about 
each clause of the Constitution. 
We have the greatest minds of the 
age, including two who had worked to-
gether to not only write the Constitu-
tion but also the Federalist Papers 
that had completely different interpre-
tations. 
It takes a lot of chutzpah to say: I 
know exactly what the universal view 
was of a clause in the Constitution and 
to do so to get the end result you want, 
which is government for the powerful. 
That is a powerfully corruptive assault 
on the core vision of our Constitution. 
Let’s take a look at another piece of 
the so-called Federalist pro-business 
viewpoint, which is that corporations 
are people, and they have full freedom 
of speech. The originalists say: Isn’t 
that obvious from the Constitution? 
Well, no, actually, it is not at all obvi-
ous because corporations in their cur-
rent form did not exist when the Con-
stitution was written. So it is not only 
not obvious; it is completely wrong. 
Corporations were created for very spe-
cific purposes in our early years. 
Professor Brian Murphy, a history 
professor at Baruch College in New 
York, wrote the following: ‘‘Americans 
inherited the legal form of the corpora-
tion from Britain, where it was be-
stowed as a royal privilege on certain 
institutions . . . used to organize mu-
nicipal governments.’’ 
Well, that is quite different from the 
corporations we have. Americans won-
dered if they should abolish them en-
tirely or find a way to democratize 
them and make them compatible with 
the spirit of independence. They chose 
the latter, so the first American cor-
porations ended up being cities and 
schools and charitable organizations. 
We don’t really begin to see economic 
enterprises chartered as corporations 
until the 1790s. 
The work being done on our current 
Constitution was being done when we 
were under the Articles of Confed-
eration. They were in place from 1781 
to 1787, a 6-year period. And during 
that period, corporations were not eco-
nomic enterprises. As the professor 
points out, they became economic en-
terprises in the 1790s. Yet, somehow, 
these Justices of the Supreme Court 
and their red robes of the superelite

say that the Constitution makes it ab-
solutely clear that these massive busi-
ness corporations have the same free-
dom of speech and the ability to par-
ticipate in elections as if they are peo-
ple, because they are people. But they 
are not people. And these economic en-
terprises did not exist when our Con-
stitution was written. 
If you want a single example of the 
complete corruption of the basic argu-
ment made by the Federalists, this is 
certainly an example to put forward. 
Murphy continues: 
The Founders did not confuse Boston’s 
Sons of Liberty with the British East India 
Company. They could distinguish among dif-
ferent varieties of association—and they un-
derstood that corporate personhood was a 
legal fiction that was limited to a court-
room. 
Corporations could not vote. Cor-
porations could not hold office. Early 
Americans had a far, more comprehen-
sive 
understanding 
of 
corporations 
than the Court gives credit for. 
Well, this is indeed the challenge 
that we have because we have a power-
ful elite that has created a system 
completely alien to the core philos-
ophy of our Constitution of govern-
ment of, by, and for the people. They 
have the money to create those hun-
dreds of lawyers working day and night 
for their vision. They have the money 
to create the hundreds of lobbyists up 
here on Capitol Hill working for their 
vision. They have the money to create 
the media campaigns that flood the 
airwaves for their vision. They have 
the money to create the Federalist So-
ciety chapters to recruit people when 
they first start law school and indoc-
trinate them in this particular vision, 
promising them great support and re-
ward in their careers to support this 
mission of government by and for the 
powerful. 
The network is extensive in ways 
that need to be completely understood 
across the country, a network of affili-
ated groups. Take the case of the Free-
dom and Opportunity Fund, a nonprofit 
that Mr. Leo, who was very involved in 
the Federalist Society, launched in 
2016. For over 2 years, the Freedom and 
Opportunity Fund gave $4 million to 
another group, the Independent Wom-
en’s Voice. In fact, about half of that 
group’s revenue came in that manner. 
In an indepth report from the Wash-
ington Post, when Kavanaugh’s con-
firmation was running into trouble, 
leaders from the Independent Women’s 
Voice sprang into action, mobilized to 
speak at rallies, wrote online com-
mentaries, and appeared on FOX News. 
They went to extraordinary lengths to 
make sure the Federalist Society’s 
nominee did not get the full examina-
tion by the people of this country. 
Now, Mr. Leo is listed as president of 
three other groups: The BH Fund, Free-
dom and Opportunity Fund, and Amer-
ica Engaged. These aren’t groups that 
have employees. They don’t have office 
space. They don’t have a website. And 
yet the BH Fund received $24 million 
from a single anonymous donor. It gave 
$3 million to two other groups, one of 
which, America Engaged, passed on $1 
million of that money to the lobbying 
arm of the NRA that went on to carry 
on a $1 million ad campaign in sup-
porting Neil Gorsuch. This is vast 
money in a vast web being deployed to 
influence Americans in every possible 
way because these folks hate the vision 
of government of, by, and for the peo-
ple. 
The Federalists don’t just carry out 
public relations campaigns. They don’t 
just recruit law students. They proceed 
to be in the very center of things pre-
senting oral arguments. They pre-
sented every oral argument on every 
single abortion case that has come be-
fore the Supreme Court since 1992. 
They are involved in issue after issue 
after issue. They have been invested in 
litigation efforts against the ACA, the 
Affordable Care Act, by trying to 
strike down healthcare for millions of 
Americans well before the act was even 
signed into law and before there was 
even anything to litigate against. A 
Federalist 
Society 
member, 
Randy 
Barnett, coauthored a 16-page legal 
memo against the law, which became a 
source of talking points during con-
gressional debate and laid the frame-
work for subsequent court challenges. 
Is it any wonder that so many of us 
across the Nation are terrified of Judge 
Barrett’s confirmation and what it 
could mean for the health of our citi-
zens? I was interested to hear a col-
league on this floor—a Republican col-
league say these are scare tactics. 
These are scare tactics to say that the 
Court might strike down healthcare. 
These are scare tactics. 
Does that colleague not believe the 
President of the United States when he 
said he will nominate someone who 
will strike down the ACA and its 
healthcare bill of rights? It is not a 
scare tactic to say the individual who 
chose the nominee said he intended to 
strike down Roe v. Wade and pick 
somebody who would strike down the 
Affordable Care Act. 
Now, the Affordable Care Act, in my 
home State, has meant 400,000 people 
gained access to Medicaid under the ex-
pansion of Medicaid. One of the ironies 
is, the largest percentage of bene-
ficiaries are in the reddest parts of the 
State, and the biggest beneficiaries in 
terms of providing healthcare are rural 
hospitals and rural clinics because the 
people who previously came couldn’t 
pay the bill, so they didn’t have the re-
sources to expand their operation, but 
now they do. 
When I do my townhalls and people 
say: ‘‘I just don’t like this ACA’’ be-
cause they have been hearing that from 
the rightwing media, I say: Well, let’s 
have a vote of everyone here. You can 
step forward or step backward. Do you 
like the idea of children being on your 
policy until age 26 because that is in 
the bill of rights—the healthcare bill of 
rights of the ACA. No, no, no. We like 
that. Overwhelmingly, we like that. 
How about tax credits to enable mid-
dle-class Americans to be able to buy 
healthcare? No, no, no. We like that. 
How about comparing policies on the 
website so you can pick a policy that is 
right for your family? No, no, no. That 
is a step forward. 
But the Federalist Society, the Presi-
dent, and the Republicans in this 
Chamber have decided that they are 
going to tear down healthcare for 20 
million Americans. So it is hardly a 
scare tactic because there are very 
powerful forces at work on that mis-
sion. 
One of the healthcare bill of rights 
that people really love in my State, 
and actually in all States across this 
country, is the protection to get a pol-
icy at the same price, even if you have 
a preexisting condition. 
I was at a fundraiser—a walkathon 
for multiple sclerosis, for MS, when a 
woman came up to me, and she said: 
Things are so much different this year. 
I said: What do you mean? The 
weather is different? The turnout is 
different? 
She said: No, no, no. A year ago, if 
someone was diagnosed with MS, we 
knew they would have a very hard 
time, 
if 
they 
didn’t 
have 
good 
healthcare, getting the help they need-
ed and then they might face lifetime 
limits or annual limits that would pre-
vent them from actually getting care, 
even though they had insurance. But 
now we can get the care we need. 
So that is the goal. That is the goal 
of the Federalist Society: tear down 
healthcare for millions of Americans. 
You may wonder if when I noted that 
the Court was against the foundation 
of our democracy—the former five Jus-
tices, soon to be six Justices in red 
robes want to tear down the basic foun-
dation of our democratic Republic. 
Well, let’s look a little more closely at 
that. 
Perhaps I can persuade you because 
the Court decided that corporations are 
people and that they can spend their 
unlimited concentrated assets in cam-
paigns—the case, Citizens United. And 
why do we call it dark money? Well, 
because corporations can give their 
money to a 501(c)(4), so-called non-
profit, and the nonprofit gives their 
money to a super PAC, which runs an 
independent campaign, and the super 
PAC discloses the nonprofit as the 
donor but not the original donor, so it 
is laundered. Nobody knows who fund-
ed that super PAC that is attacking 
you with millions of dollars of ads. 
So that certainly is the Court weigh-
ing in for the absolute suppression of 
the voice of the people and a voice 
drowned out by unlimited corporations 
from the largest, most powerful finan-
cial organizations that exist in the 
world. 
Let’s take a closer look at Shelby 
County. Shelby County, which gutted 
the Voting Rights Act, protecting the 
foundations for the citizens to fully 
participate, but the Court strikes it 
down—strikes it down. And, last year,

in Rucho v. Common Cause, the Court 
said that gerrymandering is just fine. 
They knew that it violates the very 
premise of equal representation, and 
they decided that unequal representa-
tion was just fine. Instead of defending 
the vision of our Constitution, they 
supported it being struck down. 
And we know the courts have a huge 
ability to legislate from the bench for 
the powerful. We see it time and time 
and time again. And, by the way, on 
that decision, Elena Kagan and Gins-
burg and Breyer and Sotomayor noted: 
‘‘[T]he most fundamental of . . . con-
stitutional rights: the rights to partici-
pate equally in the political process, to 
join with others to advance political 
beliefs, and to choose their political 
representatives,’’ is assaulted by this 
decision. 
Colleagues, we are in dark and dan-
gerous, tumultuous times. It is exactly 
those times that require us to stand on 
principle, with integrity, to defend our 
institutions. This process, which has 
violated 
precedent 
after 
precedent 
after precedent—a 200-year precedent 
in which always a nominee is debated 
and voted on, violated 4 years ago to 
steal a Supreme Court seat; the Lin-
coln precedent of not putting forward a 
nominee during election; the McCon-
nell precedent of saying we never de-
bate and vote in an election year enun-
ciated just 4 years ago; and the rules 
broken in the Judiciary Committee— 
all of this about one position, and that 
one position is power but not power for 
the vision of government of, by, and for 
the people but power for the powerful 
to undermine the ability of the people 
to have government of, by, and for the 
people. 
Let us honor our oath to the Con-
stitution; let us defend the integrity of 
the Court; and let us strike down this 
nominee to defend the integrity of the 
Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in opposition to the con-
firmation of Judge Barrett to the Su-
preme Court. We should not be holding 
this vote. 
We are in the eleventh hour of a 
Presidential election, and 56 million 
Americans have already voted. The 
American people are sending a mes-
sage, and we ought to hear what they 
have to say. 
Instead, what is happening in the 
Senate is an obscene power grab by my 
Republican colleagues to bypass de-
mocracy and force the least popular 
and most extreme views of their party 
onto the American people with no re-
gard 
for 
the 
life-and-death 
con-
sequences of their actions. 
So, my friends in the majority, you 
had a decade to create an alternative 
to the Affordable Care Act. You still 
have no viable plan. And after failing 
to repeal it in 2017 and suffering an un-
precedented electoral rebuke in 2018, 
you are relying on the Supreme Court 
to do your dirty work. 
Oral 
arguments 
in 
California 
v. 
Texas, the legal challenge brought by 
Republican-led States with the Trump 
administration’s support are on the 
Court’s docket November 10. We know 
full well that a 6-to-3 conservative ma-
jority of the Supreme Court is likely to 
overturn it or maybe just gut the ACA 
so deeply it will effectively be dead, as 
if that is somehow any better. 
At least 20 million people are at risk 
of losing their healthcare coverage, and 
135 million may lose protections for 
preexisting conditions. The fact that 
you are even willing to roll the dice 
with their healthcare in the middle of 
a global pandemic that has already af-
fected more than 8 million Americans 
and killed over 224,000 of your country-
men is reckless and cruel. Don’t you 
see you are playing with fire? And you 
don’t seem to care that hundreds of 
millions of Americans, Americans you 
represent, are going to get burned. It is 
not as if you aren’t hearing from peo-
ple in your States who fear a future 
without access to healthcare; it is that 
you are not listening. 
Yesterday, I spent some time with 
New Jerseyans for whom the Afford-
able Care Act—in their words, not 
mine—is a matter of life or death. For 
several of them, going without quality 
healthcare coverage is, in their words, 
a death sentence. 
I wonder how many of you would 
have the courage to listen to their sto-
ries, look them in the eye, and tell 
them you have no plan to protect their 
care. I suspect not many. So I am going 
to share just a few of their stories. 
Stephanie Vigario is a 31-year-old es-
sential worker, a pharmacy technician 
from Newark, NJ, who caught COVID– 
19. She spent 2 months—2 months— 
fighting for her life in a hospital, in-
cluding 35 days on a ventilator. By the 
grace of God, she survived, but her life 
may never be the same. Even after all 
the intensive rehabilitation she went 
through, she is still working on her re-
covery. 
There are hundreds of thousands of 
COVID–19 survivors like her grappling 
with 
the 
long-term 
health 
con-
sequences of a disease we don’t yet 
fully understand—organ tissue damage, 
weakness and fatigue, chronic short-
ness of breath. These Americans now 
have a preexisting condition. Without 
the Affordable Care Act, health insur-
ance companies could once again begin 
pricing them out of coverage or deny-
ing it altogether. 
I also had the privilege of speaking 
with Scott Chesney of Verona, NJ. 
Scott is a married father of two who at 
the tender age of 15 was paralyzed from 
the waist down. He faces a lifetime of 
expensive medical needs. To quote him: 
Aging with a disability—a preexisting con-
dition—is tough. Your body breaks down. 
Thankfully, my wife has health insurance 
because if I don’t get the medications and 
therapy I need, I don’t live. 
But without the Affordable Care Act, 
Scott will likely face annual caps and 
lifetime limits on his healthcare. Pay-
ing out of pocket for his care would 
likely lead to medical bankruptcy, and 
that burden weighs heavily on him 
every day as he thinks of his wife and 
children’s future, as well as his own. 
Finally, I want to share the story of 
Daria Caldwell of Flemington, NJ, be-
cause her situation really speaks to the 
challenges that so many of our con-
stituents across the Nation are going 
through right now. Daria lost her job 
and her health insurance as a result of 
the economic fallout of this pandemic, 
and this happened at the very time she 
was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, 
a treatable but incurable type of blood 
cancer. 
Daria is 62 years old. She is not old 
enough to enroll in Medicare. She is 
paying for COBRA right now, but it 
will soon run out, and she will need to 
find new coverage. Before the Afford-
able Care Act, someone like Daria, 
with expensive preexisting conditions, 
would basically be blacklisted from the 
individual health insurance market. An 
insurer would take one look at her 
medical history, and the fact that some 
of her cancer drugs, like Revlimid, cost 
hundreds of thousands dollars a month, 
and they would simply turn her away. 
She said: 
Dissolving the ACA would cost me my life. 
She says: 
That sounds dramatic because it is. I don’t 
want to die, but I feel like a price tag has 
been put on my head and the constant threat 
is beyond anything I thought I would ever 
have to endure. It’s nearly as devastating as 
the diagnosis itself. 
Now, I am not telling this body these 
stories 
just 
to 
pull 
at 
your 
heartstrings, though, believe me, lis-
tening to these men and women as I did 
yesterday moved me beyond tears. I am 
sharing their stories, their incredibly 
personal struggles, to remind my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle that 
to the American people this is not ideo-
logical. This is not abstract. It is per-
sonal. These are matters of life and 
death. 
Of course, the Affordable Care Act 
isn’t the only issue at stake here. The 
very reason we are here considering a 
Supreme Court nominee in the final 
days of a Presidential election is, I be-
lieve, because my Republican col-
leagues fear the will of the American 
people. 
The number of Americans who sup-
port the most far-right positions of the 
Republican Party is shrinking, and so 
stacking the Supreme Court is their 
only path to advancing their unpopular 
agenda, and they know it. 
They know that most Americans— 
nearly 80 percent according to the last 
decade of Gallup polling—oppose crim-
inalizing abortion. The overwhelming 
majority believe in the right of a 
woman to decide when she has chil-
dren, and they know it is none of the 
government’s damn business. 
They know that most Americans sup-
port action on climate change and lim-
its on how much poisonous pollutants 
companies can pump into the air.

They know that most Americans, in-
cluding responsible gun owners, sup-
port lifesaving background checks and 
tougher gun safety laws. 
And they know that most Americans 
believe that their LGBTQ sons and 
daughters and friends and neighbors 
should be able to marry the people 
they love and live their lives free of 
discrimination. 
My colleagues seem to have forgotten 
that as elected representatives of the 
American people, they are supposed to 
reflect the will of the American people. 
And guess what. The will of the people 
changes. This isn’t the 1950s anymore. 
But rather than adjust your sails to 
the winds of change, rather than meet 
the American people where they are on 
issues of life and death, you would in-
stead prefer to sink the whole ship. 
Those of my colleagues who know me 
know that I try to see the best of my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. I really do. I pride myself on my 
working relationships with so many of 
you, and some of you, I even consider 
dear friends. But I was stunned—just 
stunned—by the hypocrisy. Where are 
your principles? 
When you blocked Merrick Garland’s 
nomination, you didn’t say it was be-
cause President Obama was a Demo-
crat and the Senate was held by Repub-
licans. You said very clearly at the 
time it was because a Supreme Court 
vacancy should not—not—be filled dur-
ing a Presidential election year. You 
said the American people should have a 
voice. Now, it is clear you didn’t even 
believe the words you were saying at 
that time. 
You were determined to deprive a 
democratically elected two-term Presi-
dent of his constitutional prerogative 
in order to fundamentally alter the 
makeup of the Supreme Court. You did 
it in order to tip the scales of justice 
against 
women, 
workers, 
voters, 
LGBTQ 
Americans, 
patients, 
con-
sumers, and immigrants for genera-
tions to come. 
Judge Barrett is the culmination of a 
30-year fever dreamed up and cooked up 
by the Federalist Society and its cor-
porate benefit factors. They will fi-
nally have enough Justices to do their 
bidding, and the American people are 
the ones who will have to deal with the 
real-world consequences of this shame-
less hypocrisy. 
We have to remember what this is all 
about. This is about the right of an 
LGBTQ American to be by the bedside 
of their loved one as they take their 
last breath. This is about the ability of 
a rape or incest survivor to terminate 
an unwanted pregnancy without gov-
ernment intrusion. This is about the 
ability of a cancer patient to afford her 
treatment and a baby with a heart de-
fect to get treated without a lifetime 
limit within weeks of being born. 
So I am urging you—no, I am plead-
ing with you—to think long and hard 
about the consequences of your actions 
for both the American future and for 
the future comity of this body. You 
have twisted and distorted every rule 
and broken every norm to get your way 
just because you currently have the 
power to do so. That does not make it 
right. 
You are poisoning the well of the 
Senate and flooding our Nation with 
bad blood, and you have revealed your-
selves to be so fearful of the demo-
cratic will of the American people that 
you will confirm a Justice to the Su-
preme Court whose views are far out-
side the mainstream just days before 
the conclusion of the Presidential elec-
tion. 
I urge you not to go through with 
this vote. This is a craven abuse of 
power that will ultimately inflict great 
harm on the American people. His-
tory—history—is not going to forget it. 
And I think someday—probably sooner 
than you think—you are likely to re-
gret it. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. 
KING. 
Mr. 
President, 
‘‘The 
American people should have a voice in 
the selection of their next Supreme 
Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy 
should not be filled until we have a new 
President’’—Senator 
MITCH
MCCON-
NELL, February 13, 2016. I don’t always 
agree with Senator MCCONNELL, but I 
agree with him on that one. This is a 
violation of our rules, of our history. 
There have been 13 vacancies within 
the last 10 months of a Presidential 
election year in American history. 
Nine of them were before July 1. Of 
those nine, seven were confirmed by 
the Senate, two were not: one under 
President John Tyler and the other 
was Merrick Garland. 
There have been only four vacancies 
in the Supreme Court that have oc-
curred after July 1 of an election year; 
zero of them have been confirmed: 
three in three cases, including Abra-
ham Lincoln. They weren’t even nomi-
nees; the President waited until after 
the election. In one, there was a nomi-
nee; the Senate tabled the nomination. 
So all of this talk that we have had 
about history and precedent, those are 
the facts: 13 in the last 10 months, 9 of 
them before July 1—all were confirmed 
except one 150 years ago and Merrick 
Garland. 
I agree with MITCH MCCONNELL on 
the 13th of February 2016: ‘‘The Amer-
ican people should have a voice in the 
selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore this vacancy should 
not be filled until we have a new Presi-
dent.’’ He said that 8 months before the 
election. 
This confirmation, if it takes place 
tomorrow, will be 8 days before the 
election. It doesn’t pass the straight- 
face test. If there is a concern about 
the will of the American people, about 
one-third of the voters have already 
voted. This election is already one- 
third over, and yet we are barrelling 
forward with this nomination. We 
shouldn’t even be here. We shouldn’t 
even be having this discussion. 
One of the reasons we shouldn’t be 
here is that the Judiciary Committee 
broke its own rules in order to vote 
this nomination out. Here is rule 1 
under ‘‘Quorums,’’ section III, of the 
Judiciary Committee rules: ‘‘Seven 
Members of the Committee, actually 
present, shall constitute a quorum for 
the purpose of discussing business. 
Nine Members of the Committee, in-
cluding at least two Members of the 
minority, shall constitute a quorum for 
the purpose of transacting business.’’ 
What an inconvenient rule. But I 
have to presume that that rule, which 
has been there for years, was put there 
for a reason: in order to preserve the 
tradition of comity and respect for the 
minority that this body has often stood 
for. 
‘‘Nine Members of the Committee, in-
cluding at least two Members of the 
minority, shall constitute a quorum for 
the purpose of transacting business.’’ 
That quorum wasn’t there when this 
nomination was reported out. 
So we have trampled precedent. We 
have trampled history. We have even 
trampled the rules. 
And I know that my colleagues say: 
But it is in good cause. We need to get 
this conservative Justice on the Court. 
It is for a good cause. 
I am reminded of that wonderful 
play: ‘‘A Man for All Seasons,’’ about 
the ends justifying the means. Roper 
says: ‘‘So now you’d give the Devil ben-
efit of law’’—the rules? 
Sir Thomas More said: ‘‘Yes. What 
would you do? Cut a great road the law 
to get after the Devil?’’ 
Roper said: ‘‘I’d cut down every law 
in England to do that!’’ 
Then here is the point. This is what 
More responds: 
Oh? And, when the last law was down, and 
the Devil turned around on you—where 
would you hide, Roper, the laws all being 
flat? This country’s planted thick with laws 
for coast to coast—man’s laws, not God’s— 
and, if you cut them down—and you’re just 
the man to do it—d’you really think you 
could stand upright with the winds that 
would blow then? Yes, I’d give the Devil the 
benefit of the law, for my own safety’s sake. 
That is why we have rules, for all of 
our safety’s sake. But we are going to 
violate those rules. We are in the proc-
ess of violating those rules. 
I have heard a great deal of pearl 
clutching around here about packing 
the Court. Oh, no, somebody is talking 
about breaking the rules and packing 
the Court. Well, of course, article III of 
the Constitution doesn’t establish how 
many members of the Supreme Court 
there should be. The number of the Su-
preme Court has been changed seven 
times in our history. It has ranged 
from 4 to 10. 
I don’t want to pack the Court. I 
don’t want to change the number. I 
don’t want to have to do that, but if all 
of this rule-breaking is taking place, 
what does the majority expect? What 
do they expect? They expect that they 
are going to be able to break the rules 
with impunity, and when the shoe, 
maybe, is on the other foot, nothing is

going to happen, that the people over 
here are just going to say: Oh, well, we 
can’t change these rules? 
One of the things that has amazed me 
since I have come here is how people 
feel that they can do things to one an-
other and never have it have any con-
sequences, never have it come back on 
them. The shoe may be on the other 
foot. We don’t know what is going to 
happen next week. 
The other piece of this nomination 
that bothers me in this process is that 
there has been all this talk about 
qualifications. I would argue that 
qualifications isn’t the question; it is 
what kind of judge they will be. There 
are thousands of people in this country 
who are qualified to be a judge. There 
are 1,700 Federal judges—almost 2,000. 
There are 30,000 State judges. There are 
lots of people who are qualified, who 
have been to law school, who have been 
judges, who are smart, who can write 
opinions. That is not the issue here. 
The issue is, what kind of judge will 
this person make? That is what is im-
portant. What is their philosophy? This 
is a lifetime appointment. How are 
they going to decide important cases? 
These are important decisions. 
One week after the election, on No-
vember 10, we are going to have an ar-
gument in the Supreme Court about 
the future of the Affordable Care Act. 
Literally, tens of millions of people’s 
insurances depend upon that, not to 
mention the requirement in the Afford-
able Care Act, which is the only legal 
requirement in the country to protect 
people with preexisting conditions. 
I am tired of people around here say-
ing, ‘‘I am for protecting preexisting 
conditions,’’ when they voted to gut 
the Affordable Care Act 35, 40, 50 times. 
The President of the United States 
signs an Executive order saying, ‘‘We 
are going to protect preexisting condi-
tions.’’ It means nothing. It is not 
worth the paper it is printed on. 
The only way you can protect people 
with preexisting conditions is to pass a 
law that you can do that, and we did it 
with the Affordable Care Act. If that 
law is struck down, 130 million Ameri-
cans are at risk. They are at risk. So I 
want to know what kind of decisions is 
this person going to make? 
The Affordable Care Act is on the 
chopping block. A woman’s right to 
choose is on the chopping block. The 
scope of government action, what can 
we do here in this body, in this Con-
gress, in this government, that is on 
the chopping block. Election disputes 
are on the chopping block. I am going 
to talk a little about that later. 
But we have this bizarre current 
practice, where we have a so-called 
hearing and there are all these ques-
tions, and the witness, the prospective 
Justice, says: Well, I can’t answer that 
because that might come up when I am 
on the Court. I can’t tell you what I 
think about any of these things. 
It is as if you were courting someone, 
you are thinking about getting mar-
ried—a lifetime commitment, just like 
a lifetime appointment to the Court— 
and in the middle of one of your dates, 
you say: Well, I really like to travel. 
Do you like traveling? And she says: 
Well, I don’t know. I can’t tell you 
until after we are married. I am not 
sure. I couldn’t give you a definitive 
answer to that. 
And then you say: Well, I love opera. 
Now, my favorite thing is to go to 
opera. How about you? 
Well, I can’t answer that question. I 
can’t tell you because that is hypo-
thetical, and I will tell you when you 
invite me to an opera after we are mar-
ried. 
Then you say: Well, how about kids? 
I really want to have a big family. 
No, I am sorry. I can’t answer that 
question. 
That is exactly what is going on in 
these hearings. 
Judge Barrett didn’t answer much of 
anything. ‘‘I can’t answer that.’’ I 
think that is nonsense. 
She can say: Here is how I think 
about that issue now, but I reserve my 
right to change my mind in a par-
ticular case with particular facts after 
I have read the briefs and heard the ar-
gument, but here is how I think about 
that now. 
But no. These hearings are a waste of 
time. We learned whether or not she 
did her laundry, but we didn’t learn 
anything about how she is going to de-
cide these cases for the next 30 years. 
This isn’t something abstract. This is 
going to affect individual Americans’ 
lives; yet we are not allowed to find 
out what she really believes. 
But do you know what? For these 
last three nominees, the dark money 
folks have spent about $250 million to 
put them over the finish line; a quarter 
of $1 billion have been spent by peo-
ple—we don’t know who they are—to 
push these nominations. These folks 
aren’t investing that money on spec. 
They know what they are getting. We 
may not know what they are getting, 
but they damn well know what they 
are getting. 
They didn’t spend a quarter of $1 bil-
lion in the hopes that they knew what 
the results were going to be; they 
know. They know, but we don’t. They 
are investing; they are not contrib-
uting. 
We do have some indication of what 
her philosophy is in the abstract of she 
won’t answer questions about par-
ticular cases, but in the abstract, we 
know 
that 
she 
says 
she 
is 
an 
originalist. She says Antonin Scalia 
was her mentor. She was his clerk, so 
she is an originalist. 
What does that mean? Well, it means 
if you have a provision of the Constitu-
tion, in order to interpret what it 
means, you look at two places: You 
look at the text, what does it say, and 
then you look at the intent, the under-
standing of the text of those 55 men in 
Philadelphia in 1787. That is it, period. 
That is the analysis. 
Well, there are a couple of problems 
with that. Article I, section 8, author-
izes the Congress to raise and support 
an Army and a Navy. What about the 
Air Force? What about the Air Force? 
It doesn’t say Armed Services; it says 
Army and Navy. 
So we look to the text, Army, Navy— 
doesn’t mention the Air Force—so let’s 
look at the intent. Do we think that 
those guys in Philadelphia looked 
ahead 115 years to the Wright brothers? 
Of course not. 
That is ridiculous. That is a ridicu-
lous interpretation. Well, so how do 
you decide that the Air Force and, 
more recently, the Space Force is con-
stitutional? Well, you do a reasonable 
interpretation. What was the broad in-
tent? To protect the country. And, 
therefore, the Air Force and the Space 
Force are constitutional. 
But by an originalist’s standard, nei-
ther one passed the test—not in the 
text, not in the intent. That is sup-
posed to be the test. It is nonsense. It 
is a nonsense theory. 
The provision of the Air Force is 
pretty easy. The President has to be 35. 
That is easy. There are two Senators 
from every State—not three, not one— 
two. Those are easy. 
But what about a term like ‘‘due 
process’’? What about due process and 
the Fifth Amendment? What does that 
mean in a real case? Can you be thrown 
in jail for life and not have access to a 
lawyer? Is that due process? It was for 
about 150 years. It wasn’t until the six-
ties that right to counsel in the Gideon 
case became a constitutional right. 
Did the courts invent that? No. They 
were trying to put some life into this 
concept of due process. There is no way 
to determine exactly what a broad 
term like ‘‘due process’’ meant in 1787 
or in 1868 or in 2021. It takes a court to 
think about it and to apply some 
growth in morality, ethics, law, poli-
tics, culture, to put life into a provi-
sion like that. 
There are other ones. Let’s see: Due 
process, equal protection of the laws. It 
took about 100 years to get from the 
14th Amendment to Brown v. Board of 
Education. So the fact that segregated 
schools were a violation of equal pro-
tection of the law wasn’t very obvious 
in 1868. It took 100 years for us to get 
to the place where, yes, everybody real-
izes that that was wrong. 
This is one of the fallacies in the 
originalist theory, and Judge Barrett 
was asked about this: What about 
Brown v. Board of Education? What 
about Loving v. Virginia? I was in law 
school when Loving was decided. It was 
illegal in Virginia to have an inter-
racial marriage. It was illegal in a lot 
of States. I venture to say it was prob-
ably illegal everywhere in 1868. 
But the Court, in 1967, decided that 
marriage was a fundamental right, 
that it was part of the equal protection 
of the laws, and that it was wrong to 
tell people of different races that they 
couldn’t marry one another. 
So how does the originalist handle 
that case? They don’t dare say that 
Brown was wrongly decided or Loving

was wrongly decided. Do you know 
what they say? Do you know what she 
said? It is a superprecedent. Well, come 
on. That is a label. It doesn’t mean 
anything. That is a dodge. That is in-
tellectual dishonesty. 
If your theory works, it works. If you 
have to say that Brown or Loving or 
dozens of other cases—Miranda, Gid-
eon—are all superprecedents, it doesn’t 
speak very well for your theory. It is a 
copout. 
Now, if Antonin Scalia were here— 
whom I knew in law school, by the 
way. I knew him as Nino. If he were 
here, he would say: Well, Angus, if the 
Constitution 
needs 
amending 
and 
changing, you don’t do it by the courts; 
you do it through the amendment proc-
ess. That is why they wrote it. 
Well, the problem with that is we 
would be amending the Constitution 
about every 2 weeks around here. Can 
you imagine, if we had to do an amend-
ment 
to 
the 
Constitution, 
going 
through Congress by two-thirds and 
three-quarters of the States to legalize 
the Air Force or to say that due proc-
ess means that you don’t have to give 
evidence against yourself; that you 
have a right to a lawyer; that you have 
a right to be told what your rights are, 
as is the case in the Miranda decision? 
The Space Force. We passed the 
Space Force last year. We would have 
had to also do a constitutional amend-
ment. No. If that were the case, if we 
had to do a constitutional amendment 
every time there is a change in some-
thing in the Constitution, in the mean-
ing of a term in the Constitution, the 
Constitution would be as long as the 
United States Code. It just doesn’t 
make sense. 
The real problem with the originalist 
theory—and this is Judge Barrett, and 
I know she is intelligent, capable, law 
professor, judge—for only 3 years, by 
the way, but 3 years. The real problem 
is, the originalist theory to which she 
subscribes—and she says she subscribes 
to it—allows no room for moral or eth-
ical growth. Everything is frozen in 
1787—or 1868 if you are talking about 
the 14th Amendment. 
Jefferson got this. Jefferson wasn’t 
one of the Framers. He was in France 
at the time the Constitution was writ-
ten, but he certainly is one of the 
Founders of the country, the author of 
the Declaration of Independence, and a 
successful President. 
He wrote an interesting letter in 1816 
on exactly this point, exactly this 
point. Here is what Jefferson said: 
I am certainly not an advocate for frequent 
and untried changes in laws and constitu-
tions. 
That is the way I feel. 
But . . . laws and institutions must go 
hand in hand with the progress of the human 
mind. As that becomes more developed, more 
enlightened, as new discoveries are made, 
new truths discovered and manners and opin-
ions 
change, 
with 
the 
change 
of 
cir-
cumstances, institutions— 
That means us. 
—must advance also to keep pace with the 
times. 
Listen to this. He concludes this: 
We might as well require a man to wear 
still the coat which fitted him as a boy as 
civilized society to remain ever under the 
regimen of their barbarous ancestors. 
Now, I don’t think our ancestors, the 
Framers, were barbarous, but they 
hadn’t really thought about things like 
right to counsel, right to be aware of 
what your rights were under the Con-
stitution as a criminal defendant. They 
certainly weren’t aware of the awful, 
awful impacts of racial segregation and 
racial segregation in the schools. They 
weren’t aware of those things. 
Jefferson is right. We have to be able 
to allow our institutions to change as 
we become more developed, more en-
lightened. As new discoveries are made, 
new truths disclosed, and manners and 
opinions change, with the change of 
circumstances, institutions must ad-
vance also to keep pace with the times. 
Now, I understand the problem with 
judicial legislation. I don’t want to 
convert the Supreme Court into an 
unelected third branch of the Congress 
that has lifetime tenure. I get that. 
The Supreme Court, in its interpreta-
tion of the Constitution, can’t be to-
tally unmoored from the text of the 
Constitution or the intent of the Fram-
ers, but it has got to take a broader 
view of what these vague terms like 
‘‘due process,’’ ‘‘equal protection of the 
laws,’’ ‘‘privilege and immunities’’— 
what those things meant and what 
they mean today as we have grown and 
learned—as we have grown and learned. 
The other piece of this originalist 
philosophy and the one that I think 
may have the greatest effect as it 
takes root on the current Supreme 
Court is not necessarily in the cases 
that we are talking about like Roe v. 
Wade. It is more cases like the Afford-
able Care Act or the Environmental 
Protection Agency or the FDA or any 
effort whatsoever around here to do 
something about climate change. 
This is a straightjacket for the pow-
ers of the Federal Government. That is 
really what it is all about. That is why 
those guys invested $250 million. They 
want to cripple, strangle, and squeeze 
the Federal Government so that it 
can’t act on behalf of the American 
people. That is what is going on here. 
They don’t like the regulatory state. 
They want to repeal the new deal. 
Some originalists even question So-
cial Security and Medicare, beyond the 
powers of the Federal Government. 
That is what is going on here. 
Yet, they have a narrow, crabbed 
view of the powers of the Federal Gov-
ernment, but these originalist folks 
have a broad view of the powers of the 
State government to impose on your 
personal rights. 
I have always thought of the Con-
stitution 
as 
being 
an 
elaborate 
Vegematic which slices up power so 
that it isn’t concentrated in any one 
place. That is what the Constitution is 
all about. The fundamental issue of all 
political science is quis custodes ipsos 
custodiet, an ancient Roman question: 
Who will guard the guardians? 
We create a Constitution to give 
power to people over our lives, and 
then how do we control them from 
abusing us? History tells us it will al-
ways happen. Lord Acton, in the 19th 
century, said power corrupts and abso-
lute power corrupts absolutely. Power 
corrupts. Absolute power corrupts ab-
solutely. 
And the Framers knew this. They 
were geniuses in terms of under-
standing human nature, so they cre-
ated this elaborate Rube Goldberg 
scheme to make it hard to make laws. 
And, boy, did they succeed, as we well 
know. But even after they created this 
scheme with two houses and vetoes and 
conference committees and two-thirds 
and treaties and all of this complex in-
stitution to make laws, they were still 
scared. They were still afraid of the 
powers of a rampant majority. They 
were still afraid of what their govern-
ment would do to them. 
So they passed the Bill of Rights— 
the Bill of Rights. I have always 
thought of the Bill of Rights as a kind 
of force field around us as individuals, 
things that they can’t do to us. They 
can’t take away our freedom of reli-
gion. They can’t take away our free-
dom of speech. They can’t go after the 
press. The government can’t do these 
things. 
The originalists have a narrow view 
of what the Federal Government can do 
to help us, but they have a broad view 
of what the States can do to trample 
on those individual rights. They want 
to throw us back to a time when every 
State has its own rules on these funda-
mental rights. 
I don’t think individual Americans’ 
rights should depend on geography. 
They shouldn’t depend on where they 
live. Fundamental human rights that 
are in the jurisprudence of the U.S. Su-
preme Court over the last 150, 200 years 
should not be kicked back to the 
States to be compromised or mini-
mized. 
Finally, what is going on here is an 
undermining of confidence. We take 
this whole thing for granted—these 
magnificent halls, the marble columns, 
the speeches, the votes. It has always 
happened; therefore, it always will. 
No. We are an experiment. We are an 
experiment that has been going on for 
a little over 200 years. In human his-
tory, we are a blip. We are an anomaly. 
Democracy is very unusual and very 
hard, and it depends on trust. If you 
stop and think about it, it depends on 
trust. 
When my town clerk in Brunswick, 
ME, says ‘‘Here are the votes—Trump 
87, Biden 104,’’ I trust that those are 
the right numbers. I trust. If I don’t, 
then that way lies chaos. 
What this Senate is doing right now 
is one more drip in the undermining of 
confidence in this institution. It is no 
secret that confidence in Congress has 
plummeted over the last 25 or 30 years, 
and we are doing it. We are adding one 
more brick to that wall of lack of con-
fidence in this process by violating our

history and our rules to barrel through 
to a confirmation that I think is incon-
sistent with the rules and principles of 
this body and our own personal obliga-
tions. 
This is a blow to the Senate. What 
this process says is that anything goes 
as long as you have the votes. We don’t 
care about the rules of the Judiciary 
Committee. We don’t care about the 
history and traditions of the Senate. If 
you have the votes, ram it through. 
This body is built on some restraint, 
on some rules of comity and restraint 
and responsibility and thinking of 
what happens next. 
You are going to win this. You have 
the votes. You are going to put this 
judge through—but at the cost of just 
pulling one more support out from un-
derneath the edifice of this magnifi-
cent government. It is not only a blow 
to this institution; it is a blow to the 
Court. It is a blow to the Court, and 
here is why. 
Of all the things that Judge Barrett 
said and didn’t say in her hearing, the 
one that disturbed me the most was 
her failure to commit to recusing her-
self if a matter comes before the Court 
shortly after her confirmation involv-
ing this election of her patron, Donald 
J. Trump. 
That is a gimme. Do you know why? 
Because all the Court has is its credi-
bility. The Court doesn’t have an army. 
It doesn’t have the power of the purse. 
All it has is its integrity, its reputa-
tion for fairness. If you go out that 
door and look up, it says ‘‘Equal Jus-
tice Under Law.’’ That is what it is all 
about. 
The judicial canons speak to this 
issue very directly. Often in our lives 
we all want to avoid impropriety, but 
the judicial canons go even further: 2A 
of the judicial canon says that a judge 
must avoid the appearance of impro-
priety. What could appear to be more 
improper than a judge appointed by a 
President of the United States, and 10 
days later she votes on a matter that 
will involve his election? 
He has already told us he wants this 
election to go to the Supreme Court, 
and he has already told us he wants his 
Justice there. That is corruption in 
realtime. That is impropriety right in 
front of our eyes. That answer alone 
should have disqualified her if she 
didn’t have the integrity to say: Of 
course I won’t vote on an election mat-
ter involving this President. Of course 
I won’t. 
But she didn’t. As far as I’m con-
cerned, that is a disqualification. Now, 
I am not a Supreme Court Justice. I 
wasn’t on the law review. I am an old 
country lawyer from Brunswick, ME. 
But I know impropriety when I see it, 
and this is it. This is it. 
The Constitution is a wonderful doc-
ument. It has served this country well. 
The evolution of jurisprudence through 
the U.S. Supreme Court, with fits and 
starts, has generally served this coun-
try well. But to put a Justice on this 
Court under these procedures, under 
these circumstances, who we are pretty 
sure is going to take positions anti-
thetical to those of the majority of 
Americans and could take positions 
that will be profoundly damaging to a 
majority of Americans is an abdication 
of our responsibility. 
I understand that the majority has 
the votes. I deeply hope that, tonight 
or tomorrow morning, some Members 
of the majority will wake up and have 
an attack of conscience and say: I can’t 
do this. It is not right. It is not right. 
I can’t sacrifice the reputation of the 
Senate, compromise the reputation of 
the Supreme Court, undermine the pro-
cedures and history of this body. I 
can’t do it. 
I hope four Members of the majority 
will find it in their hearts and minds to 
take that position. I am not optimistic, 
but I think we all need to go into this 
decision, and I think all those who vote 
tomorrow have to understand what 
they are doing and what it means and 
what it will mean to the people of this 
country. 
We could have done better. We should 
have done better. We owe it to the 
American people to do better than this. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Min-
nesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, 
I come to the floor today following my 
friend, the Senator from Maine, at a 
critical moment for our country and 
for the United States. Americans, as 
we know, are facing an unprecedented 
health and economic crisis that has 
gripped our country for over 9 months. 
But, sadly, that is not what brings us 
to the Senate floor today. It is not why 
the Republican leader has called the 
Senate into session. 
Is it to pass the legislation that we 
need to pass, to carry on the work of 
the CARES Act, to help people out in 
our country right now when nearly 
every State is starting to see increases 
in this virus again? That is not why we 
are here. On this rainy, cold Sunday in 
October, instead of meeting to debate 
and vote on a comprehensive bill to 
provide relief to the American people 
during this soul-crunching pandemic, 
we are instead here today because our 
Republican colleagues insist on rushing 
through the nomination of Judge Amy 
Coney Barrett to be an Associate Jus-
tice on the U.S. Supreme Court, to fill 
the vacancy left by Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg. 
Let me start with Justice Ginsburg 
because that is really where it all 
starts. Justice Ginsburg was an icon. 
She was celebrated well into her 
eighties by people young and old. I will 
never forget my own daughter when we 
were at an event and got a photo with 
Justice Ginsburg. My daughter was 
just in college. We had that nice photo 
of the three of us, and she said to me: 
Mom, I am going to cut you out of this 
because I want to put it on Facebook, 
and the ‘‘Notorious RBG’’ is just so 
cool. 
Justice Ginsburg made justice cool 
because Justice Ginsburg understood 
that justice is supposed to be about 
people, and it is supposed to be about 
the Constitution. She started when no 
one gave her a chance, going to law 
school when there were hardly any 
girls going to law school. In fact, they 
told her not to, and she ends up grad-
uating first in her class. She then 
comes up with landmark theories on 
equal protection, and she is told maybe 
a man should argue these cases because 
they are so important and a man would 
have a better chance of winning them. 
She said: No, I will do them myself. 
And she wins five out of six cases. She 
ends up on the Supreme Court, writing 
landmark opinions and infamous dis-
sents. 
At her memorial in the Capitol, it 
was the rabbi—and I was so honored to 
be there, a moment I will never for-
get—and the rabbi said: You know, 
those dissents, those weren’t cries for 
defeat, they were blueprints for the fu-
ture. 
That is how I must think of this mo-
ment in time, as we are in the middle 
of voting, as over 50 million Americans 
have already cast their ballots, making 
their voices heard, that you can’t take 
away the fact that this nomination was 
plopped down in the middle of an elec-
tion, which is what I have argued from 
the beginning. 
This will not be a cry of defeat for 
the people of this country who care 
about Justice Ginsburg’s legacy—her 
legacy on protecting women’s rights, 
her legacy on voting rights, her legacy 
on so many other fundamental issues 
to the people of this country. 
We know what her last fervent wish 
was. Those were her words, ‘‘fervent 
wish.’’ Only Justice Ginsburg would 
use those words at the end of her life, 
but she did. She said that her last fer-
vent wish was that the next Presi-
dent—the President who wins this elec-
tion—should be able to pick the person 
to take her place. 
That is what she asked for. That is 
what so many Americans—the major-
ity of Americans—think should happen 
there. But that is not what is hap-
pening. We are not doing what we 
should be doing, and people are watch-
ing. 
More than 220,000 Americans have 
lost their lives. So many families have 
lost loved ones. Millions more have 
gotten sick or no longer have jobs. Peo-
ple are scared for themselves and their 
families. Moms are trying to balance 
their toddlers on their knees and their 
laptops on their desks. They are having 
to teach first graders how to use the 
mute button. But instead of working to 
pass a relief package—something that 
74 percent of the people want us to be 
doing right now—that is right, when 
they were asked, Do you think we 
should be pushing through a judge or 
working on pandemic relief, 74 percent 
of the people said: You should be work-
ing on pandemic relief. But instead, we 
are here, not in a rush to justice but a

October 25, 2020 
rush to put in a Justice on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
The President has made his intent 
clear. In fact, he, in his inimitable way, 
sent out a tweet on his intent. He said: 
If I win the Presidency, my judicial ap-
pointments will do the right thing, un-
like Bush’s appointee, John Roberts, 
on ObamaCare. 
This is no surprise, I guess. The Af-
fordable Care Act is something my Re-
publican colleagues have been trying 
to repeal for 10 years. Just 1 week after 
election day, the Court will hear a 
challenge to the law coming out of the 
State of Texas that millions of people 
are depending on for healthcare—espe-
cially during this pandemic, after we 
learn more and more about people who 
have gotten COVID, who then end up 
struggling later. Of course, what would 
that be called? That would be called a 
preexisting condition. Yet this is what 
this President and my Republican col-
leagues are focused on. 
The 
American 
people—Democrats, 
Republicans, 
and 
Independents—are 
continuing to face reality—not this re-
ality in this Chamber tonight, but the 
reality in their lives—once again, mis-
placed priorities in a rush to do what 
the President wants. 
The coronavirus is, in fact, still rag-
ing across our country because of the 
President’s failed leadership. That is 
true. His lies, his refusal to listen to 
science—cases have been up, as I noted, 
in about two-thirds of the States in 
just the last few weeks. 
The President was first told about 
the potential for this virus in January. 
He was telling people he knew, behind 
closed doors, that it was airborne and 
it was deadly. He knew that back in 
February. He said it would go away, 
though. To the public, he said: This 
will go away by Easter. He said: People 
will be back in church by Easter. 
There are people who went to church 
around that time in Minnesota who 
died. He said it would go away with 
warmer weather. We all know that 
these things did not happen. 
For me, this is personal, like it is for 
so many Americans. My husband got 
sick with coronavirus. He got really 
sick. He ended up with pneumonia in 
the hospital, on oxygen, for over a 
week. Why is this so personal for me, 
what the President says about this? Be-
cause back then, we were just cleaning 
off every surface in our house, which, 
of course, is still important now. But 
we thought, oh, that is good. We will 
just clean off everything, wash every-
thing. But the President, we now 
know—we found out about a month or 
two ago—back in March, he knew it 
was airborne, but he said he didn’t 
want to tell the American people be-
cause—well, he thought it might panic 
people. He didn’t tell you the truth. 
Now, we know that at least 130,000 
American lives could have been saved 
if the President had taken real action 
early on. That comes out of a new 
study from Columbia. That is 130,000 
families who would still have their 
mom or dad or grandparent with them 
at the table, with them at the table 
this Thanksgiving—if the President 
had done what we needed to get testing 
in place, to do contact tracing, to lis-
ten to the experts. 
And, no, it is not just the Big Ten 
football, as much as we love Big Ten 
football in Minnesota. It is not just 
those players who should be able to 
have that testing. It is not just the 
people in the White House who should 
be able to have that testing. There are 
consequences of this failed leadership. 
The American people who are dealing 
with this pandemic are not concerned 
about the false claims in the Presi-
dent’s 3 a.m. rants or his attempts to 
relitigate the 2016 election right now. 
They are just trying to make it 
through the day. They need help. But 
instead of giving them that help, here 
we are, once again, jamming through a 
nominee. 
In fact, according to reports, Senator 
MCCONNELL
is actively telling the 
White House not to negotiate on a bi-
partisan package, just so the Senate 
would do this. They have broken prom-
ise after promise. They have blown 
every precedent. They have ignored all 
logic and taken on every risk, just to 
push this nomination through. 
Why the rush? Well, I can give you 
some ideas. One, as I mentioned, just 1 
week after the election, just 2 weeks 
from now, the Supreme Court will con-
sider the future of the Affordable Care 
Act. We also know—and this is coming 
directly 
from 
the 
President, 
via 
tweet—that he wants the Justices to 
potentially count the ballots—those 
are his words, not mine—and that he 
wants nine Justices on that Court. 
No, I will not concede that this elec-
tion will end up in Court, not the way 
people are voting, not the numbers we 
are seeing out there, not the reality 
that people are facing, but that is what 
he wants in place. 
Everything is on the ballot, but 
many of these things end up in Court. 
We know that. And during the Judici-
ary hearing, many of my colleagues 
would act like the Supreme Court was 
some far away, distant ivory tower in-
stitution, debating things and talking 
about things, and in their words, like 
the Dormant Commerce Clause. That is 
true, they decide cases on the Dormant 
Commerce Clause. 
What else do they decide? They de-
cide who you can marry. They decide 
where you can go to school. They de-
cide if you can use contraception. They 
decide all kinds of things. They decide 
if you can vote. They decide if you can 
have healthcare. All those things are 
decided in the Supreme Court. 
What is on the ballot when it comes 
to healthcare? What is before us with 
this Justice? The Affordable Care Act. 
What is this about? 
I still remember the day that we 
passed the bill. I was here early in the 
morning on Christmas Eve. And I also 
remember the day when our colleagues 
tried to repeal the bill, and my friend, 
Senator McCain, actually whispered to 
me what he was going to do before he 
did it. But he came in, and he put a big 
thumbs down while he himself strug-
gled—struggled—with his own life. 
What did the Affordable Care Act 
mean to people? Millions of people got 
coverage and millions of people who 
weren’t able to get coverage before— 
and then for everyone, even people who 
had coverage before, they got some-
thing that they so badly needed, and 
that is, protection from being kicked 
off your health insurance for pre-
existing conditions. 
What else did it mean? Young people 
can stay on their parents’ insurance 
until the age of 26. What a difference 
that makes. It makes a difference for 
people like Evelyn and Maraya, iden-
tical twins from Cambridge, MN, honor 
roll students and star athletes. They 
play basketball, and they also play 
softball. One is a pitcher and one is a 
catcher. One of them was born and 
early on got severe diabetes when she 
was very young. Does it matter which 
one, the pitcher or the catcher? They 
both deserve good healthcare, espe-
cially now when they both know they 
have diabetes. But early on, did it mat-
ter which one? They both deserve good 
healthcare. 
There are people like Steve, a senior 
from Tower, MN, who has a heart con-
dition and relies on his prescription 
medication to stay alive; like Elijah 
from St. Paul, who was born with cere-
bral palsy, and because of the Afford-
able Care Act, is now 16 and a proud 
Boy Scout; or Christie, a mom from 
Bloomington whose daughter had a 
tumor; like Casie, whose brother lives 
in Alexandria and has chronic kidney 
failure and needs a transplant. Without 
the ACA, her brother will die waiting 
for a transplant. And then, like Emily, 
from Minneapolis, whose mom was di-
agnosed 
with 
breast 
cancer; 
or 
Burnette from the suburbs of St. Paul, 
whose daughter has multiple sclerosis 
and depends on the ACA; or Janet from 
Rochester, whose brother has a mental 
illness; or Liliana from Fridley, who 
has a 21-year-old son with autism and 
needs her children to be able to stay on 
her insurance until they are 26; or 
Melanie, a senior from Duluth, who is 
treated for ovarian cancer and needs 
access to healthcare. 
Repeal after repeal after repeal at-
tempt, that is what has been happening 
here. And none of that worked. So what 
happened? A case was brought in 
Texas, and the administration is now 
before the Supreme Court arguing that 
the entire Affordable Care Act, not just 
one provision, they are arguing—and 
let me be clear about this—that the en-
tire Affordable Care Act, all those pro-
visions and all the coverage I just men-
tioned, should be thrown out. 
During 
Judge 
Barrett’s 
hearing, 
there was a lot of talk from my col-
leagues on the other side about the 
doctrine of severability, which the Su-
preme Court has said includes the pre-
sumption in favor of throwing out part

October 25, 2020 
of a statute in order to save the rest. 
Their point, I suppose, was that the 
American people shouldn’t actually be 
worried about the case pending before 
the Supreme Court. It is OK. 
So I asked Judge Barrett whether the 
brief that was filed by the Trump Jus-
tice Department, which argued that 
the entire Affordable Care Act must 
fall, represented the President’s posi-
tion before the Supreme Court. She 
confirmed, as a former clerk of the Su-
preme Court to Justice Scalia—she 
confirmed that it did, and she con-
firmed that if the President believed 
that the Court should throw out just 
part of the Affordable Care Act and 
save the rest, well, he could direct the 
Justice Department to withdraw the 
brief. That has not happened. That is 
not the position of this administration. 
They have told the Court that they 
want to throw the whole thing out, and 
now they are rushing to confirm the 
President’s nominee with the hope that 
she will cast a deciding vote to strike 
down the ACA. 
For me, as I noted at the hearing, it 
is about following the tracks. No, the 
nominee didn’t give us a sense of pend-
ing cases. We know that. But she didn’t 
even give a sense of what she thought 
about existing laws that are on the 
book or about certain fundamental 
rights that other nominees have dis-
cussed. So I followed the tracks, just 
like we do when we go hiking. 
When we would go hiking in North-
ern Minnesota when I was growing up, 
my mom would always say: OK. That is 
a deer track or that is an elk or, if we 
were really lucky, that is a bear. And 
you would follow those tracks down 
the trail or down the road, and then 
you would get to the corner and maybe 
you would see that deer. Every so 
often, you did. We would follow the 
tracks. 
So that is what we must do—ordinary 
citizens and U.S. Senators—to try to 
figure out where this Justice is going 
to be on these fundamental cases that 
are in front of the Court. You have got 
to follow the tracks. 
So what do we have? Well, we have 
got the fact that President Trump 
promised that his judicial appoint-
ments would do the right thing and 
overturn the Affordable Care Act. He 
tweeted that it would be a big win if 
the Supreme Court strikes down the 
healthcare law. And if that wasn’t 
clear, he just went on ‘‘60 Minutes’’—he 
released the tape himself on Thursday, 
and then it was on tonight—and he said 
it will be so good if the Supreme Court 
overturns the Affordable Care Act. OK. 
So this isn’t something from 3 years 
ago. No, no, no. This is something that 
we all saw tonight. 
Then, on September 18, when the Na-
tion was mourning the loss of a judicial 
giant, President Trump saw his mo-
ment, and on September 26, at what be-
came a superspreader party at the 
White House, he announced his nomi-
nee. 
So here is what we know as we follow 
the tracks. In an article Judge Barrett 
wrote for the University of Minnesota 
Law School journal called ‘‘Constitu-
tional Commentary,’’ in 2017—the same 
year that she became a judge this was 
published—she wrote that Chief Justice 
Roberts—these are her words—‘‘pushed 
the Affordable Care Act beyond its 
plausible meaning to save the statute.’’ 
That was a case called NFIB v. 
Sebelius that she was writing about— 
‘‘pushed the Affordable Care Act be-
yond its plausible meaning to save the 
statute.’’ That is direct criticism of the 
Chief Justice’s decision to allow the 
Affordable Care Act to stand. 
And in a 2015 NPR interview on King 
v. Burwell—this is a different case, but 
it involves the Affordable Care Act; an-
other case where Chief Justice Roberts 
cited in favor of the Affordable Care 
Act—there, Judge Barrett acknowl-
edged that the majority’s holding is 
good because millions of people won’t 
lose their healthcare subsidies. Yet she 
praised the dissent by Justice Scalia 
saying it had the better of the legal ar-
gument. 
Now, remember, she spent all her 
time in the hearing saying: Whatever 
the policies are don’t matter. What 
matters is the legal argument. What 
matters is the law. And her position, 
which I don’t agree with, but her posi-
tion was that Justice Scalia had the 
better of the legal argument. That is 
one big track to see where she is com-
ing down. 
When she accepted the President’s 
nomination at the White House, she 
made clear that she considers Justice 
Scalia, one of the most conservative 
judges in our Nation’s history, as a 
mentor. Those are our tracks. 
But it is not just on healthcare. What 
other tracks do we have to follow? 
Well, she signed her name to a public 
statement featured in an ad calling for 
an end to what the ad called the ‘‘bar-
baric legacy’’ of Roe v. Wade, which 
ran on the anniversary of the 1973 Su-
preme Court decision. There is your 
track. 
She wrote her own dissent dis-
agreeing with longstanding Court rul-
ings on gun safety, expressing her legal 
opinions that some felons should get 
guns. 
She once discussed the dissent in the 
marriage equality case of Obergefell v. 
Hodges, asking whether it was really 
the Supreme Court’s job to make that 
decision. 
Those are the tracks that lead all of 
us down that path to the point where 
you go around the curve, and you real-
ize at least one thing for sure, and that 
is that Judge Coney Barrett’s judicial 
philosophy is the polar opposite of Jus-
tice Ginsburg’s. 
Voting rights. Here is another exam-
ple. Given the timing of this nomina-
tion and the fact that we are just over 
1 week from election day, when I asked 
Judge Barrett would she say that mail- 
in voting is essential right now, even 
though the coronavirus continues to 
spread and people are having to choose 
between their health and their vote, 
she instead called it, well, it is a mat-
ter of policy. When I asked her, she 
would not say that voter intimidation 
is illegal, even though in Minnesota, an 
outside contractor was recruiting poll 
watchers with Special Forces experi-
ence during the judge’s hearing. That 
is clear voter intimidation. I was not 
asking her about an ongoing case. I 
was actually asking her just if it is 
against the law. It is. It violates 18 
U.S.C. section 549. 
And while in the case of Minnesota, 
the company has now agreed to cancel 
its plans after Minnesota Attorney 
General Ellison opened an investiga-
tion, we are seeing threats to the right 
to vote in States across the country. 
And when I asked, Judge Barrett even 
refused to acknowledge that the Con-
stitution empowers Congress to protect 
the right to vote. 
So the inescapable conclusion from 
these tracks is that Judge Barrett, 
again, would be very different than 
Justice Ginsburg. Justice Ginsburg was 
a champion of voting rights. 
When a 5-to-4 Court gutted a key pro-
vision of the Voting Rights Act in 
Shelby County v. Holder, Justice Gins-
burg wrote in her famous dissent that 
the Constitution uses the words ‘‘right 
to vote’’ in five separate places, and in 
each place, it reaffirms—these are her 
words, 
Justice 
Ginsburg—‘‘Congress 
holds the lead rein in making the right 
to vote equally real for all U.S. citi-
zens.’’ Justice Ginsburg understood 
that voting—you don’t just say it is a 
fundamental right. It is how you pro-
tect it. 
How do we do that? By standing up to 
voter intimidation and voter suppres-
sion, by protecting our democracy from 
a President who tries to undermine 
free and fair elections, by protecting 
the millions of people who are going to 
the polls right now during this pan-
demic, some risking their lives to cast 
a ballot. And during her hearing, Judge 
Barrett did not make these simple 
commitments. 
So I am very concerned about this 
fundamental issue of voting rights. The 
stakes have never been higher than 
they are right now. Look at what is 
happening. In Texas, they are trying to 
force each county to have only one bal-
lot drop box, including Harris County, 
which has 4.7 million people, one box. A 
judge stepped in and said: No, this is 
wrong, 
and 
then 
three 
Trump-ap-
pointed judges on the Fifth Circuit va-
cated the district court’s order. No 
matter what the size of your county, 
you just get one box. 
In Tennessee, Republicans have tried 
to prevent ballot drop boxes, and they 
have argued in court that COVID–19 is 
not a valid excuse to vote by mail. 
In South Carolina, the U.S. Supreme 
Court earlier this month reinstated a 
South Carolina requirement that mail- 
in ballots must have a witness signa-
ture, so voters in South Carolina are 
going to be forced to go out in the mid-
dle of a pandemic and find someone to 
witness their ballot.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6497 
October 25, 2020 
And as we saw last Monday, in a case 
that went to the Supreme Court from 
Pennsylvania, Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett could in fact be the swing vote on 
a case like this. This is a case where 
last week the Supreme Court issued a 
split 4-to-4 decision that let stand the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling 
allowing election officials to count 
mail-in ballots received within 3 days 
of the election even if they are not 
postmarked. 
And just last Wednesday, the Su-
preme Court blocked curbside voting in 
Alabama, which was intended to help 
whom? Voters with disabilities. In dis-
sent, Justice Sotomayor quoted How-
ard Porter, Jr., a Black man in his sev-
enties with asthma and Parkinson’s, 
who said this: 
So many of my [ancestors] even died to 
vote. And while I don’t mind dying to vote, 
I think we’re past that—we’re past that 
time. 
That is how I feel a lot about what 
this judge who is before us now, her 
views on originalism, her views on not 
changing with the times, like so many 
other Justices interpret the Constitu-
tion to mean, so that it matters to ev-
eryday people—but not this judge. 
Some of my Republican colleagues, 
as I noted, think that this is something 
distant and far away. As I noted, we 
cannot divorce this nominee and her 
views from the election we are in now. 
The last time we had a vacancy so 
close to a Presidential election was in 
1864. Then President Abraham Lincoln 
did the wise thing, the right thing, and 
he waited until after the election to fill 
the vacancy. 
And in 2016, when Justice Scalia died 
about 9 months before the election, 
Senator MCCONNELL said this: 
The American people should have a voice 
in the selection of their next Supreme Court 
Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not 
be filled until we have a new President. 
That is what we are talking about 
with the unfairness of this, with the 
sham of this proceeding, and I laid out 
for you tonight the reasons I believe 
that this has become such a high pri-
ority instead of passing pandemic re-
lief. 
During the week of Judge Barrett’s 
hearing, more than 220,000 more people 
got COVID–19. At least 2,700 more peo-
ple died from it. Nearly 800,000 people 
filed for unemployment. More small 
businesses closed too. According to one 
study, actually, recently, around 800 
small businesses are closing every day. 
In my home State, one in five small 
businesses say they will be forced to 
close if we don’t do something about it. 
Let me give you an example. Jose 
Frias from St. Paul is one of them. He 
is a third-generation business owner 
who owns Boca Chica Mexican family 
restaurant, which includes a fast-food 
taco house, restaurant, and catering 
service. He started as a manager at 20 
years old and worked his way up, tak-
ing over 2 years ago—his dream. The 
future looked bright, but then the 
virus hit. Jose was forced to go from 98 
employees to just 48. His guest res-
taurants closed entirely and revenue 
from catering is down 90 percent. In his 
words, the business, which he has been 
running with his sisters, aunts, nieces, 
and a few remaining staff, was his 
‘‘whole life . . . and it [has] come to a 
standstill.’’ 
This is happening all over the coun-
try. On October 6, Federal Reserve 
Chair Jerome Powell made clear that it 
would be tragic if Congress fails to pass 
an economic relief package. We have 
startups that were already in a slump 
before this and numbers are plum-
meting more. Small businesses are 
closing. A conservative Supreme Court 
that has done nothing when it comes to 
antitrust—nothing—yet Justice Gins-
burg, she always dissented. She made 
the cases for those small businesses. 
But the Trump Justices, they have 
gone the opposite way. 
I want to end with this. America, you 
deserve better. You deserve leaders 
who will put you first. You deserve 
leaders who will protect your jobs, 
your families, and your healthcare. 
You deserve a Supreme Court nominee 
who will speak truth to power or at 
least acknowledge when basic prece-
dent exists, even if it is inconvenient 
to the President who nominated her. 
There may be nothing we can do any 
longer to stop this confirmation, but 
there is one thing you can do to deter-
mine the future of this Nation—those 
blueprints for the future that Justice 
Ginsburg would refer to—you can vote. 
And when you cast your ballot, remem-
ber where those tracks lead. 
There is another way other than this 
administration and this hypocrisy we 
are seeing and this gridlock that has 
taken over this U.S. Senate. It is 
spelled out right there in the first 
three words of the Constitution. We 
can be a nation in which ‘‘We the Peo-
ple’’ truly means all the people—a na-
tion in which the people have a say and 
in which the people determine the fu-
ture. 
Remember, this isn’t Donald Trump’s 
country. It is yours. This shouldn’t be 
Donald Trump’s Justice. It should be 
yours. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, a 
little over a month ago I came to the 
floor to honor the late Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, a trailblazer, an icon, 
and a friend. I shared what she meant 
as a personal hero for me and as a role 
model to millions of other women. I 
discussed her groundbreaking work and 
how much of what she fought for is now 
on the line. 
I talked about the message Ruth left 
before she died, stating her ‘‘most fer-
vent wish’’ that her replacement not be 
named ‘‘until a new President is in-
stalled.’’ 
It has been 37 days since Ruth died. I 
miss her. America misses her. It has 
also been 37 days since MITCH MCCON-
NELL
declared 
he 
would 
disregard 
Ruth’s ‘‘most fervent’’ wish and move 
ahead with a corrupt and illegitimate 
process to fill her seat on the Supreme 
Court. Just 8 days—8 days—before the 
election, when tens of millions of 
Americans have already cast their bal-
lots and just 15 days before the Su-
preme Court will hear a case that could 
overturn the Affordable Care Act, Don-
ald Trump, MITCH
MCCONNELL, and 
their Republican buddies are shoving 
aside the wishes of the American peo-
ple in order to steal the Supreme Court 
seat. 
MITCH
MCCONNELL
and the Senate 
Republicans violated the long-estab-
lished rules of the Judiciary Com-
mittee to rush their nominee through, 
giving each other a wink and a nod be-
fore they turned a blind eye to their 
own rulebreaking. They even violated 
the rule MITCH MCCONNELL made up in 
order to keep one of President Obama’s 
nominees off the Court long before any-
one was voting: no confirmations of 
Justices in an election year. So they 
made up the rules, then they broke 
those same rules. They cheated. 
Why? Why was it so important that 
they were willing to turn their backs 
on the very rules that they had put in 
place? Why rush through this nomina-
tion? 
Why? Because the Republican Party 
is scared that they can’t win through 
the democratic process, scared that 
they can’t win by playing by the rules, 
that they can’t win when the American 
people decide the outcome, that they 
can’t win when elections matter. 
What we are seeing today is the last 
gasp of a desperate party—a party 
working to undermine our democracy 
so that they can keep pushing their ex-
tremist agenda just a little longer, a 
party that doesn’t reflect the views of 
a majority of Americans or the values 
that we hold dear. 
This is a party beholden to billion-
aires and extremists that is desperate 
to keep its grasp on power and willing 
to break any rule, any precedent, or 
any principle to hold on to that power 
just a little longer. The Republican 
Senators bat down every concern. 
No Supreme Court nominee has been 
confirmed this close to a Presidential 
election. They say: No problem. Repub-
lican Senators plunge ahead with an il-
legitimate nomination made by a mor-
ally bankrupt President. 
The Rose Garden ceremony to cele-
brate the nomination turns into a 
coronavirus superspreader event. Re-
publican Senators brush it off. Repub-
lican Senators will press ahead with 
hearings while members of the Judici-
ary Committee are in quarantine, and 
some of them refused to get tested. 
Hundreds of thousands of Americans 
are dead and millions are waiting for 
the Federal Government to finally 
show up and fight this pandemic. Re-
publican Senators say: Sorry, no time. 
Senate Republicans have better things 
to do than pass a relief package— 
things like steal a Supreme Court seat. 
Here is the ugly truth: Donald Trump 
and his Republican buddies know that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6498 
October 25, 2020 
confirming Amy Coney Barrett to the 
Nation’s highest Court is their path to 
advance an extremist agenda long after 
the country is fed up and disgusted 
with their failures. In the middle of an 
election, in the depths of a pandemic, 
their extremist agenda is all that mat-
ters, and that is why they are so des-
perate to ram her nomination through 
the Senate. 
The confirmation hearings were a 
sham. The conclusion was foregone, 
and the nominee spent days ducking 
and dodging legitimate questions about 
where she stands on issues of crucial 
importance to the American people. It 
was little more than a PR stunt. 
But what the nominee refused to say 
was actually very informative. She re-
fused to say whether the ruling uphold-
ing the right to contraception was cor-
rect. She refused to say whether the 
government can criminalize a same-sex 
relationship. She refused to say wheth-
er it is wrong to separate children from 
their parents in order to deter immi-
gration. She even refused to say wheth-
er climate change is happening and 
whether it poses a threat to human 
beings. 
This was no hearing. This was a 
farce. 
Their attempt to remain silent on 
key issues spoke volumes. It shows 
that she believes these critical rights, 
protections, and values are debatable, 
up for grabs. And Barrett’s refusal to 
embrace these commonsense values 
shows just how out of step, how ex-
treme, Barrett is and will continue to 
be if she is confirmed. 
Let’s be real. We already know what 
Barrett is all about. We know why cor-
porate interests and rightwing zealots 
are so excited about her, why so many 
Republicans will vote to confirm her, 
and why Trump, who has handed the 
judiciary over to the Federalist Soci-
ety, has nominated her. It is because 
she will advance their extremist, con-
servative agenda. 
So her question-dodging isn’t a prob-
lem for them. It is part of their strat-
egy to get her onto the Court. 
They know where she stands, and so 
do the American people. We already 
know because her record is clear. 
Take reproductive rights. President 
Trump pledged to nominate Supreme 
Court Justices who would overturn 
Roe. Listen to him. He said he would 
only appoint someone who would over-
turn Roe, and then he picked Barrett. 
In 2006, Barrett signed a newspaper ad 
calling for the end of Roe and describ-
ing Roe as ‘‘barbaric.’’ She was a mem-
ber of an anti-choice group while on 
the University of Notre Dame faculty. 
And how would she overturn Roe? 
After all, Roe is the current law of the 
land. But Barrett has that all worked 
out. She holds a dangerously radical 
view on legal precedent. 
In a 2013 Law Review article, she sug-
gested that the Supreme Court is not 
strictly bound by precedent and that 
public debate about Roe leaves open 
the possibility of overruling it. To 
state 
it 
plainly, 
Barrett 
believes 
women cannot be trusted to make deci-
sions about their own bodies. She is a 
clear and present danger to Roe. 
When it comes to the Affordable Care 
Act, again, listen to Trump himself. He 
said he would only nominate judges 
who will end the ACA law, judges who 
would take away healthcare coverage 
from millions of Americans. He picked 
Barrett. 
Barrett’s record indicates that is ex-
actly what she will do—work to gut 
key provisions that protect millions of 
Americans. She criticized Chief Justice 
Roberts’ opinion in 2012 upholding a 
critical part of the ACA, saying that he 
‘‘pushed the Affordable Care Act be-
yond its plausible meaning to save the 
statute.’’ 
In a media interview in 2015, she said 
that in another Supreme Court deci-
sion that upheld the ACA, the dis-
senting Justices who wanted to over-
turn the ACA had the ‘‘better of the 
legal argument.’’ 
While claiming just to follow the 
text of the law, Barrett’s record shows 
that her purported ‘‘textualist’’ ap-
proach is nothing but a facade, merely 
a cover for her to reach a result that 
will further the interests of those with 
money and power. 
Barrett’s 
record 
isn’t 
just 
cringeworthy; it is downright alarm-
ing. On November 10, just 1 week after 
election day, the Supreme Court will 
hear a case that will determine the fate 
of the Affordable Care Act. And right 
now, 17 cases that could undermine the 
right to abortion care are one step 
away from the Supreme Court. Twen-
ty-one States are ready to go. They 
have already drafted laws they can 
pass immediately—laws that could be 
used to restrict abortion in case Roe is 
overturned. 
And it is not just reproductive rights 
and access to healthcare that are on 
the line. Trump and his Republican 
enablers want a Justice who will 
rubberstamp 
Trump’s 
racist 
and 
xenophobic attacks on immigrants, 
from ripping away protections for our 
Dreamers to rewriting the census. Once 
again, this is exactly what Donald 
Trump told us he would do after he lost 
earlier court cases. 
Trump and his Republican enablers 
also want a Justice who will turn back 
the clock even more on workers’ 
rights. Trump wants a Justice who will 
erode workers’ ability to join together 
and fight for fair pay and working con-
ditions and to push back against em-
ployment discrimination. We know this 
is what they want because those are 
the policies the Trump administration 
has pursued and what Barrett’s anti- 
worker record tells us that she will do. 
There 
is 
another 
thing 
about 
Barrett’s record that deserves special 
attention just 8 days before the elec-
tion. 
Trump 
and 
his 
Republican 
enablers want a Justice who will strip 
away voting rights, especially from 
communities of color and marginalized 
communities. 
Trump wants a Supreme Court Jus-
tice who will help undermine our de-
mocracy. We know this because Trump 
already told us his game plan to do it. 
Trump and his Republican enablers are 
working to make voting as difficult, 
confusing, and scary as possible, and 
they are using every tool in order to do 
it. 
Trump has lied repeatedly about 
mail-in voting. He has falsely claimed 
it is a source of rampant fraud. 
Trump’s lawyers have sued States that 
have taken action to try to help Amer-
icans vote safely during this pandemic 
by expanding vote-by-mail. And at the 
same time, Trump and his cronies are 
working to dismantle the U.S. Postal 
Service, slowing down mail delivery 
and creating even more barriers to the 
ballot at a critical moment in this 
election. 
We have all seen the President’s 
reckless, dangerous statements over 
the past few months casting down on 
the election itself, peddling the fact- 
free claim that this election will be 
‘‘the most rigged’’ in American history 
and that he is ‘‘not sure’’ that the elec-
tion results will be accurate. 
Most alarming of all, Trump has re-
peatedly refused to commit to a peace-
ful transfer of power, and he said that 
he would not accept the election re-
sults if he doesn’t win. 
And as her confirmation hearing 
shows, Barrett is just the Justice Don-
ald Trump is looking for. In her hear-
ing, Barrett refused to recuse herself in 
a case that might decide the outcome 
of the election, and she refused to say 
whether she believes that a President 
should commit to the peaceful transfer 
of power. 
She also refused to say whether voter 
intimidation is illegal, which it is; 
whether the President can unilaterally 
delay an election, which he cannot; and 
whether the Constitution empowers 
Congress to protect the right to vote, 
which it does. 
The stakes have never been higher 
for our democracy. On one issue after 
another, on one right after another, 
Trump and his Republican enablers 
have made it clear that they want a 
Court that will bend over backward 
even further for the wealthy and well- 
connected while running roughshod 
over everyone else. They want a Court 
that will keep them in power, even 
when voters have had enough of their 
fearmongering and division and graft, 
and Barrett is their choice to do just 
that. That is why this vote is so crit-
ical. 
A vote for Barrett is a vote to strip 
healthcare from millions of people. It 
is a vote to turn back the clock on re-
productive 
freedom, 
to 
endanger 
Dreamers and immigrants, to let cli-
mate change rampage unchecked, to 
imperil efforts to address systemic rac-
ism, to support workers’ rights, voting 
rights, LGBTQ rights, gun violence 
prevention—all at risk. 
Ultimately, it is also a vote to 
rubberstamp an illegitimate process

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6499 
October 25, 2020 
carried out against the wishes of much 
of the Nation and against the backdrop 
of a deadly crisis that Senate Repub-
licans have ignored as Americans have 
died. 
Let’s be very clear: If Trump and Re-
publicans succeed in ramming this 
nomination 
through, 
the 
American 
people will expect us to use every tool 
we have to undo the damage and re-
store the Court’s integrity. 
I am under no illusions here. Demo-
crats have fought tooth and nail, but 
the Republicans control the Senate. 
The reason the Republicans are willing 
to break every rule to jam through an 
illegitimate nomination 8 days before 
the election is that they have realized 
a truth that shakes them down to their 
core: The American people are not on 
their side. 
People all over this country are 
fighting to reclaim our democracy. 
They are registering to vote, and they 
are voting. They are voting like never 
before. They are speaking out and tell-
ing their stories. They are fighting for 
a democracy that works for all of us, 
not just for the privileged few. And 
they will continue to fight until they 
have taken our democracy back from 
those who have worked around the 
clock to undermine it. 
Now, I want to spend some time drill-
ing down on what is at stake with this 
vote, starting with the impact that dis-
mantling the Affordable Care Act will 
have on my constituents in Massachu-
setts. 
I will start with an op-ed that I wrote 
with Amy Rosenthal, the executive di-
rector of Health Care for All, and Kate 
Walsh. She is the president and CEO of 
Boston Medical Center. It was pub-
lished in the Boston Globe, and it was 
entitled ‘‘The Affordable Care Act and 
coverage for Massachusetts residents is 
at risk.’’ 
Here is what we wrote: 
Dave was laid off from his hotel job in 
March due to the coronavirus pandemic, and 
he lost his health insurance too. A week 
later, he was rushed to the emergency room 
with a lung problem. With support from an 
enrollment assister, he was able to enroll in 
MassHealth coverage that was made possible 
because of the Affordable Care Act, better 
known as ObamaCare. He is just one of the 
hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts resi-
dents given a lifeline by the ACA. 
Yet, the multi-year effort to repeal the law 
is coming to a head at the worst possible 
time. Just days after the November election, 
the US Supreme Court will hear oral argu-
ments in a case seeking to overturn the 
ACA. And Supreme Court nominee Amy 
Coney Barrett has a clear record on the 
issue. She has openly questioned the con-
stitutionality of the ACA, arguing the Su-
preme Court’s ruling upholding the ACA’s in-
dividual mandate was ‘‘illegitimate.’’ If she 
is confirmed to the court, she may provide 
the decisive vote to strike it down. For peo-
ple like Dave, and more than 23 million oth-
ers nationwide, access to health care hangs 
in the balance. 
The need for health care coverage has 
never been more dire than during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. It has laid bare dev-
astating racial disparities in health care ac-
cess and outcomes. The ACA coverage expan-
sions led to progress toward equity, with the 
gap with insurance coverage rate for Black 
and white adults dropping by 4 percentage 
points and the difference between Hispanic 
and white adults falling by 9.4 points. In-
stead of building on these important steps, 
overturning the ACA would further exacer-
bate inequities in access to health care. 
The elimination of the ACA would also be 
devastating for people with specific health 
care needs, including 1.8 million people liv-
ing with substance use disorders and mental 
illness. Protections would also be stripped 
away from 135 million people who have pre-
existing conditions like diabetes, cancer, 
asthma, and those now who have had COVID– 
19. Insurance companies could once again 
charge women 50 percent more than men for 
coverage and impose lifetime caps on bene-
fits. It would strip a popular feature for fam-
ilies: coverage for those up to age 26 who 
have sought coverage on their parents’ plans 
at a time when youth unemployment has 
doubled due to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
In Massachusetts, where our state’s health 
reform law served as a model for the ACA, 
many falsely believe we would be protected 
if the ACA were struck down. This is not the 
case. Thanks to the ACA, a number of new 
protections were implemented in the Com-
monwealth: the provision allowing young 
people to stay on their parents’ plan and the 
reduction of prescription drug costs for sen-
iors caught in the Medicare ‘‘donut-hole.’’ 
These protections could be gone overnight if 
the ACA were invalidated. 
In addition, an ACA repeal would impact 
access to health coverage and healthcare for 
hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts con-
sumers. The state’s health insurance cov-
erage expansions were only possible with the 
partnership and funding from the federal 
government. This is especially true for the 
expansion of MassHealth, our Medicaid pro-
gram, as well as the availability of afford-
able coverage through ConnectorCare. Over 
375,000 Massachusetts residents could lose 
their health coverage and the state stands to 
lose up to $2.4 billion in federal funds. These 
immense cuts would create a funding gap 
that would be impossible to fill even during 
normal times. The challenge is even greater 
now: According to some estimates, Massa-
chusetts may face a deficit of up to $6 billion 
as a result of the pandemic. These funding 
shortfalls could have devastating implica-
tions for the health care safety net in Massa-
chusetts. 
Taking coverage away from people during 
the worst pandemic we have experienced in 
the last century is simply despicable, and we 
should all be outraged. Massachusetts de-
serves more from its President and from its 
government. All of us must speak up, speak 
out, and make it abundantly clear that the 
ACA cannot be repealed. 
Speaking up includes speaking up 
about how the ACA has transformed 
people’s lives. So many folks in Massa-
chusetts reached out to my office to 
share their stories and how they would 
be harmed if healthcare were ripped 
away, so I want to introduce you to a 
few of those people: Marleny, Deb, and 
Charlie. 
Marleny is a single mom from Fra-
mingham. She receives her healthcare 
through ConnectorCare, the plans we 
have in Massachusetts for low-income 
families who don’t qualify for any 
other 
program. 
Her 
children 
use 
MassHealth Family Assistance, which 
is our CHIP program. 
She says that, without the help she 
gets 
from 
MassHealth 
and 
from 
ConnectorCare, she couldn’t pay her 
rent and bring food to the table for her 
kids. 
You know, the Affordable Care Act 
helped Massachusetts expand Medicaid 
and more affordable insurance plans 
like the ones Marleny uses. But if 
Trump’s Supreme Court nominee over-
turns the ACA, Massachusetts could 
lose $2.4 billion in Federal funding. 
Over 375,000 people like Marleny and 
her children could lose their coverage. 
Deb from Greenfield knows what it is 
like 
not 
to 
be 
able 
to 
pay 
for 
healthcare. She told me: ‘‘I was an 
American whom ObamaCare saved at 
the very moment I lost my career and 
my health.’’ She writes: ‘‘You must 
step in and take action. We cannot sit 
idly by while our access to affordable 
healthcare hangs in the balance.’’ 
Deb is right, and there are millions of 
people across this country who have 
lost their jobs during this pandemic 
and economic crisis and could be in the 
exact same position that Deb was in. 
And, finally, I checked back in with 
my friend Charlie and her mom, Re-
becca, who live in Revere. Charlie and 
I fought side by side at the Capitol dur-
ing the healthcare fights in 2017. 
Her mom reminded me: ‘‘Due to se-
vere preeclampsia, Charlie was deliv-
ered at 26 weeks gestation and weighed 
790 [grams]—about 1 pound 12 ounces. 
She was in the NICU for 3 months. 
Without the ACA, she would have ex-
ceeded a lifetime cap before ever com-
ing home from the hospital. Addition-
ally, she would have been uninsurable 
because her birth was a preexisting 
condition. With access to health care, 
Charlie was able to thrive despite some 
pretty significant diagnoses. Now, at 
the age of 8, Charlie lives a very much 
typical life.’’ 
Repealing the Affordable Care Act 
now would be devastating for Rebecca 
and Charlie. They can’t go back to life-
time caps or sky-high rates and denied 
coverage because of preexisting condi-
tions. None of these families can. 
And, like so many policies, Black and 
Brown communities will be dispropor-
tionately affected if the ACA is de-
stroyed. 
I want to read another op-ed I wrote 
recently 
that 
was 
published 
in 
Shondaland. It discusses the harm of 
stripping away healthcare for commu-
nities of color, and here is what it says: 
Over ten years ago, President Barack 
Obama signed the Patient Protection and Af-
fordable Care Act (ACA) into law. Since 
then, we’ve made progress. Millions of Amer-
icans now have high-quality, affordable 
health insurance. We no longer have to 
worry about being denied coverage because 
of preexisting conditions. Millions of young 
adults can stay on their parents’ plans until 
age 26. States were given the option to ex-
pand Medicaid eligibility—providing cov-
erage to more than 12 million low-income 
Americans. 
But now, the ACA is at risk because Re-
publicans are trying to ram through Amy 
Coney Barrett’s nomination to serve as the 
next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. 
They are trying to push her confirmation 
through at breakneck speed because just one

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6500 
October 25, 2020 
week after the November elections, a case to 
overturn the ACA will be in front of the Su-
preme Court, and Republicans want Barrett 
to have their back, cast the deciding vote, 
and deliver a deathblow to the law. 
Republicans have railed against the ACA 
from the day it was passed, making its re-
peal a tenet of their platform in every presi-
dential and congressional race. They’ve tried 
dozens and dozens of times to tear it down 
piece by piece—all while ignoring the pleth-
ora of data that demonstrates the good it has 
done for the American people. Among the 
chorus of ACA detractors is Judge Barrett. 
While she tried to claim during her Supreme 
Court hearing that she is ‘‘not hostile to the 
ACA,’’ her record says otherwise. She criti-
cized Chief Justice Roberts’ vote in 2012 to 
uphold the ACA and wrote reviews ques-
tioning the law’s constitutionality. Her nom-
ination is just the latest Republican attack 
on the ACA—and if she is confirmed, MITCH 
MCCONNELL and Donald Trump might get 
their wish and succeed in ripping healthcare 
away from tens of millions of people during 
a global pandemic. 
Here’s what that would mean: In the mid-
dle of the Covid-19 crisis, insurance compa-
nies would instantly be able to enforce caps 
on coverage or deny coverage to the 133 mil-
lion Americans with preexisting conditions 
like asthma, diabetes, and even pregnancy. 
Covid-19 itself could be considered a pre-
existing condition for the millions of Ameri-
cans who have survived the virus. The 12 mil-
lion low-income Americans now covered by 
Medicaid expansions would lose their cov-
erage, including more than 850,000 Americans 
struggling with opioid use disorder, [people 
who] rely on Medicaid for life-saving medica-
tion assisted treatment and counseling serv-
ices. Millions of young adults would be 
thrown off of their parents’ insurance, forc-
ing them to pay out of their own pockets 
even as many struggle under a mountain of 
student loan debt, stagnant wages, and high 
unemployment rates due to the pandemic. 
And the damage won’t stop there. Repeal 
of the ACA would have devastating con-
sequences for Black and brown communities 
that disproportionately benefit from its cov-
erage. The ACA helped narrow disparities in 
access to healthcare in the United States 
and provided millions of Black and brown 
families affordable options for care. Without 
the ACA, one in every five Black Americans, 
and one in three Hispanic Americans would 
be uninsured. If the ACA is dismantled, 
Black and brown communities that benefit 
from Medicaid expansions would be kicked 
off their insurance. In the midst of a mater-
nal mortality crisis that disproportionately 
impacts mothers of color, moms across this 
country could lose access to the well woman 
visits and the maternity coverage currently 
required by the ACA. 
So let’s call out the Supreme Court nomi-
nation for what it is—Donald Trump and the 
entire Republican Party’s big chance to com-
plete a decade-long partisan attack on the 
ACA and on Americans’ rights to health 
care. It’s the big chance for a desperate 
party to impose its extreme views on the 
people of this country because they couldn’t 
actually get it done through Congress. 
The majority of Americans want the Sen-
ate to wait until after the election to choose 
a new justice. It’s because this is a life or 
death situation for their friends, their fami-
lies, and for tens of millions of their fellow 
Americans. 
In 2012, after yet another attack on the 
ACA was defeated in the Supreme Court, 
Justice Ginsburg wrote that ‘‘the crisis cre-
ated by the large number of U.S. residents 
who lack health insurance is one of national 
dimension’’ and cited the ‘‘inevitable yet un-
predictable need for medical care’’ as a rea-
son to uphold the legislation. [Justice Gins-
burg] was right. Health care is a basic 
human right. We fight for basic human 
rights. We fight against this nomination. 
And we fight any attempt to rip away 
healthcare from families. We do this to-
gether. 
It is not just healthcare for tens of 
millions of people that is on the line. A 
woman’s 
right 
to 
make 
her 
own 
healthcare decisions is also in jeop-
ardy. Roe v. Wade is a landmark case 
that protects a woman’s right to abor-
tion care. A few weeks ago, I published 
an op-ed in The Cut that discusses 
what this nomination means for the 
right to abortion care, and I want to 
read it now for you. This is what I 
wrote: 
The decision whether or not to bear a child 
‘‘is central to a woman’s life, to her dignity. 
It is a decision she must make for herself. 
When government controls that decision for 
her, she is being treated as less than a fully 
adult 
human 
responsible 
for 
her 
own 
choices.’’ 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that 30 
years ago, at her Supreme Court confirma-
tion hearing. She understood that reproduc-
tive freedom is foundational to equality and 
critical to women’s health and to their eco-
nomic security. Without access to high-qual-
ity reproductive healthcare—including con-
traception and safe, legal abortion—we can-
not have true equality. 
But President Trump, Senate Republicans, 
and their extremist allies just don’t care. 
They’ve spent almost 4 years of the Trump 
administration—and . . . many years before 
[that]—undermining health care and turning 
back the clock on reproductive rights. That’s 
why they nominated Amy Coney Barrett to 
sit on the Supreme Court. She’s the ticket 
for a desperate, right-wing party that wants 
to hold onto power a little longer in order to 
impose its extremist agenda on the entire 
country. 
President 
Trump 
and 
his 
Republican 
enablers have tried to deny this obvious fact. 
The President recently said that he ‘‘didn’t 
know’’ how Barrett would rule on reproduc-
tive rights, and Republicans in the Senate 
have fallen in line. The Republican Party 
knows the large majority of Americans do 
not support overturning Roe v. Wade. They 
benefit when we stay on the sidelines—and 
they want us to sit back and stay quiet while 
our fundamental freedoms are on the line. 
But we see right through their radical 
play. 
President Trump picked Barrett as his Su-
preme Court nominee to take us back in 
time. Roe v. Wade established the constitu-
tional right to safe and legal abortion and 
has been the law of the land for over 47 
years. But over, and over, and over again, 
President Trump has bragged about his plans 
to appoint justices who would ‘‘automati-
cally’’ overturn Roe. The Affordable Care 
Act expanded access to reproductive health 
care—like no-co-pay birth control—for mil-
lions [of people]. But President Trump has 
promised to overturn the Affordable Care 
Act in its entirety, and sent his Justice De-
partment to ask the Supreme Court to do ex-
actly that. 
Barrett is Trump’s ideal candidate to ac-
complish his plans. In 2006, she signed a 
newspaper ad calling for the end of Roe and 
describing the decision as ‘‘barbaric.’’ She 
was a member of an anti-choice group while 
on the University of Notre Dame faculty. 
She’s also been critical of the Affordable 
Care Act and the Supreme Court’s past deci-
sion to uphold the law in court. Her position 
on abortion and other reproductive rights 
are clear: She believes women cannot be 
trusted to make decisions about their own 
bodies. 
If Barrett’s nomination makes you scared 
and angry, you are right to be: 17 abortion- 
related cases are already one step away from 
the Supreme Court. Twenty-one States have 
laws that could be used to restrict abortion 
in the case that Roe is overturned. And if 
Barrett’s confirmation is rammed through 
quickly, she’ll have the opportunity—on No-
vember 10—to hear a case about overturning 
the Affordable Care Act and a lifetime on the 
nation’s highest court to undermine the 
rights and the values we hold dear. 
Access to birth control has changed the 
economic futures of millions of women, and 
access to safe abortion care is an economic 
issue, too. For a young couple with modest 
wages and piles of student loan debt, the de-
cision to start or expand a family is a power-
ful economic [one]. For a woman working 
two jobs with two kids already in day care, 
an unplanned pregnancy can upend budgets 
already stretched too far. For a student still 
in high school or working toward a college 
degree, it can derail the most careful plans 
for financial independence. Indeed, one of the 
most common reasons that women decide to 
have an abortion is because they cannot af-
ford to raise a child. 
And let’s be explicitly clear: If these at-
tacks succeed, they will have disproportion-
ately negative consequences for women of 
color who are already facing some of the 
most insurmountable barriers to abortion 
care. 
Rich women will still have access to 
abortion and reproductive care, but it 
will be Black and Brown women— 
women with low incomes, women who 
can’t afford to take time off from 
work, and young women who were 
raped or molested by a family mem-
ber—who will be the most vulnerable. 
This is not a moment to back down. 
Already, it is inspiring to see so many 
women and friends of women coming 
off the sidelines in this fight, and we 
must continue to speak up. Call your 
Senators and make sure this conversa-
tion is grounded in our real experi-
ences. Men must speak up, too, because 
reproductive freedom affects us all. 
Voting is already underway across 
the country, and there are only 26 days 
before the election is completed. And 
the data shows that most Americans 
want to wait until after the election 
for a new Justice to be confirmed. Jus-
tice Ginsburg gave us our marching or-
ders: Do not fill this Supreme Court 
seat until after the election when the 
next President is installed. We will 
fight hard together to honor her wish. 
There are countless powerful stories 
that demonstrate why abortion rights 
are so important. I am going to read a 
few of them. The first is from my 
friend and colleague from Michigan, 
Senator PETERS, who became the first 
sitting U.S. Senator to share his abor-
tion story. I will just read an excerpt of 
that powerful piece that was published 
in Elle magazine. 
In the late 1980s in Detroit, Peters and his 
then wife, Heidi, were pregnant with their 
second child, a baby they very much wanted. 
Heidi was four months along when her water 
broke, leaving the fetus without amniotic 
fluid—a condition it could not possibly sur-
vive. The doctor told the Peters to go home 
and wait for a miscarriage to happen natu-
rally.

October 25, 2020 
But it didn’t happen. They went back to 
the hospital the next day, and the doctor de-
tected a faint heartbeat. He recommended an 
abortion because the fetus still had no 
chance of survival, but it wasn’t an option 
due to a hospital policy banning the proce-
dure. So he sent the couple home again to 
wait for a miscarriage. ‘‘The mental anguish 
someone goes through is intense,’’ Peters 
says, ‘‘trying to have a miscarriage for a 
child that was wanted.’’ 
As they waited, Heidi’s health deterio-
rated. When she returned to the hospital on 
the third day, after another night without a 
natural miscarriage, the doctor told her the 
situation was dire. She could lose her uterus 
in a matter of hours if she wasn’t able to 
have an abortion, and if she became septic 
from the uterine infection, she could die. 
The doctor appealed to the hospital’s board 
for an exception to their anti-abortion policy 
and was denied. ‘‘I still vividly remember he 
left a message on the answering machine 
saying, ‘They refused to give me permission, 
not based on good medical practice, simply 
based on politics. I recommend you imme-
diately find another physician who can do 
this procedure quickly,’ ’’ Peters recalls. 
The Peters were able to get into another 
hospital right away because they were 
friends with its chief administrator. Heidi 
was rushed into an emergency abortion that 
saved her uterus and possibly her life. The 
whole experience was ‘‘painful and trau-
matic,’’ Heidi shared in a statement. ‘‘If it 
weren’t for urgent and critical medical care, 
I could have lost my life.’’ 
Reflecting on the experience now, 
Senator PETERS says it ‘‘enacted an in-
credible emotional toll.’’ So why go 
public with it? ‘‘Well, it’s important 
for folks to understand that these 
things happen to folks every day,’’ he 
explains. ‘‘I’ve always considered my-
self pro-choice and believe women 
should be able to make these decisions 
themselves, but when you live it in real 
life, you realize the significant impact 
it can have on a family.’’ 
PETERS decided to share his story at 
this moment because the right to make 
such decisions as a family, free of poli-
tics, has never been more at stake. He 
is alarmed by the threat of Donald 
Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Amy 
Coney Barrett—the threat she poses to 
women’s reproductive rights. The very 
conservative nominee once signed her 
name onto a newspaper ad calling Roe 
v. Wade, the landmark decision that le-
galized abortion, ‘‘barbaric.’’ If Repub-
licans successfully confirm her to fill 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat, she could 
reverse legal abortion in America or 
significantly curtail it. ‘‘It’s important 
for folks who are willing to tell these 
stories to tell them, especially now,’’ 
PETERS says. ‘‘The new Supreme Court 
nominee could make a decision that 
will have major ramifications for re-
productive health for women for dec-
ades to come. This is a pivotal moment 
for reproductive freedom.’’ 
Senator PETERS is right: This is a 
pivotal moment for reproductive free-
dom. I have heard from so many of my 
constituents about the importance of 
Roe and reproductive freedom. I am 
just going to share two of their stories. 
The first is from Kate, who lives in 
Medford, MA. Here is what Kate wrote: 
Most of my life, my strong support for 
abortion was as impersonal as it was impor-
tant. A late bloomer, I barely dated until I 
was in my 20s, then quickly met and married 
my wonderful husband. Our birth control al-
ways worked perfectly. Anyway, we are both 
family-minded, and dreamed of building our 
family big with lots of kids. 
My husband and I had one daughter, 
planned and loved. But the second child was 
not so easy. I suffered three miscarriages in 
two years before a baby finally stuck. Preg-
nancy brought months of crushing nausea. 
But the sicker I felt the better, the doctors 
said, things must be going [well]. Healthy, 
healthy, healthy, they told me, time after 
time. 
By late may, the end was in sight. Big and 
ripe and swollen, I bundled myself into the 
hospital for an ultrasound. I brought a tiny 
sweater to knit while I waited. After an hour 
of examination, a doctor entered the dark 
room. She saw the sweater and asked, ‘‘Is it 
for the baby?’’ I nodded proudly and showed 
her how all the pieces would line up, just so, 
to fit my newborn daughter. A month was 
plenty long to finish such a small project. 
‘‘It’s beautiful’’. She told me, her eyes filling 
with tears. 
Then she turned the monitor toward me so 
that I could see the big, black fluid-filled 
holes in my baby’s brain. 
There was so little that I knew that day. I 
didn’t know about Dandy Walker Malforma-
tion or Agenesis of the corpus callosum. I 
knew love. I knew fear. I knew my values. 
And I knew that I was in Boston, medical 
mecca, hub of the universe. 
I learned more about brains in general and 
my baby’s brain in particular. MRI revealed 
poor prognosis. My daughter would not like-
ly ever walk, talk, support the weight of her 
own head, or swallow. I learned that infant 
hospice was out of the question, and that I 
could not refuse a feeding tube for my baby. 
Dumbfounded, I asked the neurologist, 
‘‘What does a baby like mine do? Just . . . 
sleep all day?’’ He winced. ‘‘Babies like 
yours,’’ he explained, ‘‘are not often com-
fortable enough to sleep.’’ I knew what I 
needed to do. 35 weeks pregnant, and I was 
afraid, even, to tell my husband, my mother, 
my doctor, my genetic counselor, but I 
talked to my family, and I called the hos-
pital. It was a Friday afternoon. My doctor 
was busy delivering triplets. I left a message. 
‘‘I want to know all my options,’’ I said. ‘‘All 
of them.’’ 
She called me back at 6:30 p.m. and talked 
fast. She gave me the number of an adoption 
agency in upstate New York that specializes 
in medically complex children. 
‘‘I’m so sorry,’’ she said. ‘‘But if you want 
an abortion, you have to decide right away. 
You have to call before the end of the work 
day, mountain time. You have to be on an 
airplane on Monday, you have to show up 
Tuesday with $25,000 up front. I’m so sorry,’’ 
she said again. I did not have $25,000. I didn’t 
know if the number led to a safe, legal doc-
tor, or if it led to some back-alley quack. I 
knew only my desperation. I called the num-
ber right away. The woman on the phone was 
very kind. She, too, apologized. ‘‘But Dr. 
Hern does not practice after 36 weeks, and 
you’ll be 36 weeks on the last day of your 
procedure.’’ ‘‘Yes,’’ of course, I said. ‘‘Of 
course. I understand. We’ll be there. We’ll 
find the money.’’ 
And we did. There wasn’t one day of open 
banking before our trip, so a loan was out of 
the question. We had to rely on my family. 
They were able to increase their credit while 
we flew across the country and withdraw 
funds from their retirement account to cover 
the bill later in the month. Without them, I 
don’t know what would have happened. I 
know, now, about the abortion funds. But 
just as I didn’t risk asking if what I was 
doing was safe and legal, I didn’t want to ask 
for financial help. Everything felt so fragile. 
I met Dr. Hern and his excellent team with 
great relief. They explained the procedure. 
My third trimester abortion was humane, 
gentle, safe—safer, even in the 36th week, 
than full term live birth. We laid my daugh-
ter to rest in my womb that first day, a 
Tuesday. Friday morning, after brief labor, I 
delivered her whole and still, into the hands 
of my savior. He brought her to me after. 
She was still warm, but not quite warm 
enough. 
Dr. Hern saved my daughter from immeas-
urable suffering. He saved my family from 
having to go against our deepest held values. 
Dr. Hern saved me from my own desperation. 
And every step of the way, he saved my dig-
nity. 
I want to share one more story. This 
one is from Wendy in Greenfield, MA. I 
will just read a part of what Wendy 
wrote. She said: 
I know firsthand that overturning Roe— 
whether overtly or by chipping away at ac-
cess to abortion until Roe becomes meaning-
less—will not stop women from seeking abor-
tions. It will, however, deny women access to 
safe abortions. Abortion has been with us 
since women have been getting pregnant, 
and will continue to be with us no matter 
what the politicians and judges decide. In 
1961, I was 17 and abortion was not yet legal, 
but I was pregnant and did not want to be. I 
was fortunate because I was able to tell my 
parents, and they helped me find a doctor— 
but finding a safe, compassionate doctor 
turned out to be a different story. 
We knew an illegal abortion could be ex-
pensive and my parents didn’t have much 
money, so we made a plan together that I 
would go by myself in the hopes that he 
would take mercy on me and charge me less. 
I know there were many heroic doctors 
who helped women back then at great risk to 
themselves, but this doctor, who I’m sure 
had seen other young women who were alone 
and without support, thought he could take 
advantage instead. I remember finding the 
somewhat rundown building and walking up 
a dark flight of stairs to his office. There was 
nobody else there, just the two of us, the of-
fice was untidy and dimly lit with the win-
dow blinds down. And the doctor himself ap-
peared unkempt and unprofessional. His 
clothes were rumpled, he sat too close to me 
and put his hand on my knee and said ‘‘we 
don’t have to use the word abortion, dear.’’ 
I knew immediately that I did not want 
this man to touch me, let alone perform an 
abortion, so I did what many young women 
in my situation back then weren’t able to do: 
I walked out. I went back down that flight of 
stairs and out into the light of the street. I 
felt—and still feel—it was a narrow escape. 
So we found a second doctor—and in fact 
this time it was my younger sister who had 
a guitar teacher who knew someone, because 
that’s how it worked back then—and this 
time my mother came with me. We had to go 
at night to the back door, and though there 
was no nurse or assistant, this office was 
clean and it looked like a real medical office, 
and the doctor looked like a real doctor. But 
he was not a compassionate man. As I lay 
there on the exam table with my mother in 
the next room, the doctor lectured me the 
whole time, telling me I was a sinner, that 
the abortion was the ‘‘wages of sin,’’ that he 
hoped I would learn my lesson, and he 
threatened that if I made any noise, he 
would stop the procedure, I would have to 
have the baby, and everyone would ‘‘know 
my shame.’’ 
Although my experience was scary and 
humiliating, my story is not as horrific as 
many from that time—I survived, without 
injury, as many women did not—but that’s 
because I was lucky. I was lucky to have sup-
portive parents, I was lucky they could af-
ford to pay, I was lucky to have a precocious

sister, and I was lucky her guitar teacher 
had contacts, and lucky he knew of a medi-
cally competent doctor. But nobody should 
have to depend on luck to get a safe abor-
tion. 
Although that doctor tried to shame me, I 
am not ashamed. I don’t think abortion is 
shameful and I have never had a moment’s 
regret. My abortion allowed me to live the 
life I wanted and to become a parent when I 
was able to raise a child properly and respon-
sibly. This was good for me and my life, but 
it is also a social and public health good. 
Abortion is a necessary part of family plan-
ning and women’s healthcare and denying or 
restricting access to it means that women 
can not safely control their reproduction and 
therefore can’t really control their lives, 
which means they can’t participate fully and 
equally in society. It is bad social policy to 
hobble half of the population. 
Women of my generation already know 
what pain and hardship results from abor-
tion bans, but younger women have grown up 
taking abortion access for granted as a right, 
and I urge them to speak out and tell their 
stories. And not only women, but men, and 
other family members and friends who have 
been involved and who have been affected. 
Bring up your experiences in conversation, 
contact your legislators and tell them. They 
are the ones in immediate danger and whose 
lives and whose families’ lives will be af-
fected. 
Senator PETERS’ story, Kate’s story, 
Wendy’s story are just about how gut- 
wrenching these decisions are. These 
are personal decisions that women 
should make for themselves. 
The Senate has no business taking up 
a vote on a Supreme Court Justice who 
is already committed to taking away 
healthcare from millions of people and 
to take away Roe v. Wade and this pro-
tection from millions of women. 
We may not have the votes to stop 
them, but that does not change the 
fact that what the Senate Republicans 
are doing is wrong. We will continue to 
fight it. We will fight it now in the 
Senate, and we will fight it come elec-
tion day November 3. 
I yield the floor.

MORNING BUSINESS 
NOMINATION OF AMY CONEY 
BARRETT 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, when 
the Senate considers nominees to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, it is particularly 
important that we act fairly and con-
sistently, using the same set of rules, 
no matter which political party is in 
power. 
When President Obama nominated 
Judge Garland 8 months before the 2016 
Presidential election, I met with him 
and maintained that he was entitled to 
a hearing. Others argued that the win-
ner of that year’s Presidential election 
should be allowed to choose the nomi-
nee, and that is what happened. My 
views did not prevail, and the standard 
was established that a nominee to the 
Court would not be voted on prior to 
the election in a Presidential election 
year. This year, a vacancy has also oc-
curred, notably much closer to the 
election. 
Prior to Justice Ruth Bader Gins-
burg’s death, I stated that, should a va-
cancy on the Supreme Court arise, the 
Senate should follow the precedent set 
4 years ago and not vote on a nominee 
prior to the Presidential election. 
Since her passing, I have reiterated 
that in fairness to the American peo-
ple—who will either be reelecting the 
President or selecting a new one—the 
decision on the nominee to fill the Su-
preme Court vacancy should be made 
by whoever is elected on November 3. 
Because this vote is occurring prior 
to the election, I will vote against the 
nomination of Judge Amy Coney Bar-
rett. To be clear, my vote does not re-
flect 
any 
conclusion 
that 
I 
have 
reached about Judge Barrett’s quali-
fications to serve on the Supreme 
Court. What I have concentrated on is 
being fair and consistent, and I do not 
think it is fair nor consistent to have a 
Senate confirmation vote prior to the 
election.

REMEMBERING ELLEN M. BLOOM 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, 
earlier this year we lost one of our Sen-
ate alumnae—a constituent and a per-
sonal friend—Ellen Michelle Bloom. 
She was a devoted mother and wife, 
who dedicated her career to public 
service and advocating for consumers. 
While she was not a household name, 
her 40–year career has benefited the 
lives of millions of Americans. 
Ellen began her extraordinary career 
while a student at the University of 
Maryland, interning for Senator John 
Tunney before joining the staff of a 
newly elected Senator, Howard Metzen-
baum. Her first job was in the mail-
room, 
answering 
constituent 
mail, 
learning about the concerns of Ohioans 
and figuring out how to navigate the 
bureaucracy. 
Over the ensuing 18 years on Senator 
Metzenbaum’s staff, Ellen rose through 
the ranks, at a time when female aides 
were a distinct minority, to become his 
legislative director and an expert in 
consumer protection. As her many 
friends and colleagues have written in 
the months since her passing at age 65, 
Ellen was not interested in attention; 
she was only interested in results. A 
long-time friend and colleague wrote of 
Ellen, ‘‘It’s amazing how much you can 
get done when you don’t care who gets 
the credit.’’ That was Ellen. 
From provisions in the 1984 Cable Act 
mandating Equal Employment Oppor-
tunity standards, to promoting chil-
dren’s television legislation, to regula-
tions requiring lavatories on commuter 
airplanes, to warning labels on large 
buckets designed to protect small chil-
dren from drowning, Ellen’s work was 
far-reaching. She advocated for the use 
of car seats and bicycle helmets and 
was among a small group who sought 
to bridge the ‘‘digital divide’’ long be-
fore it became a popular phrase. She 
believed in equality and fairness and 
sought ways to incorporate these prin-
ciples into public policy. 
When Senator Metzenbaum retired, 
Ellen was recruited to join the Clinton 
administration, first at the National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration, then as the Commerce 
Department’s Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary for Legislative Affairs, and last-
ly as Deputy Chief of Staff for Com-
merce Secretary William Daley, where 
her responsibilities included the 2000 
Census. 
Following her public service career, 
Ellen joined the Washington staff of 
Consumer Reports. As Director of Fed-
eral Policy and head of the D.C. office, 
she led the organization’s advocacy in 
support of the Affordable Care Act, 
fought for stricter vehicle emission 
standards, 
promoted expanded con-
sumer product labeling, and worked on 
many other issues that protected the 
safety and health of American con-
sumers. 
At a time when so many question the 
ability of the government and public 
advocacy to improve the quality of life 
for our citizens, Ellen’s work stands as 
an antidote to cynicism. She recog-
nized that the work of democracy is 
hard but always had faith that we 
could make progress. 
Her legacy of good works is a testa-
ment to that conviction and an inspira-
tion for all. She was also an example of 
how to face adversity with courage and 
fortitude. 
While her professional accomplish-
ments were many, her greatest pride 
was her family: her husband David 
Bushnell and their children Michael 
and Jenna Bushnell, her many nieces 
and nephews, her brother and sister-in- 
law, her cousins spread across the 
country. Her life was too short—way 
too—short; but it was full of love and 
rich in the ways that gave it depth, 
joy, and consequence. 
We were lucky to have such a dedi-
cated and passionate public servant. I 
was fortunate to count Ellen as a dear 
friend. She made our country a better, 
safer place. She may be gone, but her 
many accomplishments live on and will 
continue to protect and benefit Ameri-
cans for generations to come. We need 
many more Ellen Blooms, but she was 
one of a kind.

f 
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–244. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
to repeal the federal ban on Pell Grants for 
prison-based education; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 234 
Whereas, The federal Pell Grant Program 
provides need-based grants to low-income 
undergraduate 
and 
certain 
postbaccalaureate students to promote ac-
cess to postsecondary education. Pell grants 
have been helping millions of low-income 
students across the country access postsec-
ondary education for 45 years; and 
Whereas, The federal Violent Crime Con-
trol and Law Enforcement Act denied all in-
carcerated individuals’ eligibility for federal 
financial aid in 1994, making prisoners ineli-
gible to receive Pell grants and therefore 
less likely to obtain a postsecondary degree 
while incarcerated. Until 1992, Pell grants 
were available to incarcerated individuals. 
As a result, education programs expanded 
throughout the prison system, and by 1990, 
there were 772 prison college programs in 
more than 1,000 correctional facilities; and 
Whereas, Postsecondary courses and train-
ing for incarcerated people will make them 
more likely to secure jobs and succeed eco-
nomically upon release. While currently only 
24 percent of people in federal prison have 
had access to some postsecondary education, 
65 percent of all new jobs nationwide now re-
quire a postsecondary degree; and 
Whereas, 
Postsecondary 
education 
and 
training programs lead to lower recidivism 
rates, less crime, and improved public safety. 
Incarcerated people who participate in post-
secondary education and training programs 
are 43 percent less likely to recidivate than 
those who do not participate; and 
Whereas, Prison education reduces vio-
lence within the prison system. Prisons with 
college programs have fewer violent inci-
dents, which allows corrections officials to 
do their jobs in a safer environment; and 
Whereas, Prison-based education is cost-ef-
fective. Every dollar invested in prison-based 
education yields $4.00 to $5.00 in taxpayer 
savings in reduced long-term incarceration 
costs; and 
Whereas, Removing the federal ban on Pell 
grants for prison education would expand ac-
cess to postsecondary education for people in 
Michigan’s prisons; and 
Whereas, Should the surplus for the Pell 
grant program run low and there is a need to 
prioritize the awarding of Pell grants, non- 
prisoner applicants should have priority over 
prisoner applicants; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we memorialize the Congress of the 
United States to repeal the federal ban on 
Pell grants for prison-based education; and 
be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–245. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Michigan urging the United States Congress 
to allocate funding for states that have es-
tablished broadband expansion block grant 
programs; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 283 
Whereas, Broadband internet is a critically 
important communications method Ameri-
cans use to connect with one another. Busi-
nesses, consumers, workers, and students use 
the internet for a variety of purposes, mak-
ing it indispensable in today’s society; and 
Whereas, During the COVID–19 crisis, the 
internet has become an even more important 
and essential tool in providing a means for 
Americans to connect with work, school, and 
health care. Ensuring that all Americans 
have access to broadband services at speeds 
they need to fully participate in our society 
is imperative; and 
Whereas, Multiple states have established 
broadband expansion block grant programs 
to distribute funds to internet service pro-
viders for the purpose of building out 
broadband infrastructure in rural and under-
served areas of their states. This includes 
Michigan’s Connecting Michigan Commu-
nities grant program; and 
Whereas, Congress can assist states work-
ing to increase broadband availability to 
homes, business, and other entities by mak-
ing funds available to improve and continue 
expanding broadband infrastructure; now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the Congress of the United 
States to allocate funding for states that 
have established broadband expansion block 
grant programs; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–246. A resolution adopted by the City 
Council of Atlanta, Georgia urging the 
United States Senate to appropriate funds to 
sustain the U.S. Postal Service, and to en-
sure the Postal Service continues to function 
as a universal public service; to the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs. 
POM–247. A resolution adopted by the Bay 
County, Florida Board of Commissioners, 
strongly urging the President of the United 
States and the United States Congress to 
provide the financial assistance required to 
aid states and local units of government as 
they continue to deal with the economic 
long term effects of Covid-19; to the Com-
mittee on Finance.
