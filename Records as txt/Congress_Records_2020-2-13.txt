Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2020 
No. 30 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Merciful God, we give You thanks for 
giving us another day. 
As Members prepare to return to 
their home districts, endow them with 
ears to hear the voices of their con-
stituents, those who voted for them 
and those who did not. It is the 
strength of our representative democ-
racy that all have a voice in the gov-
erning of the Nation. 
Our Nation will soon be remembering 
Presidents Washington and Lincoln, gi-
ants of American history. One presided 
over a nation united in its inception 
behind their President, the other over 
a nation divided soon after his election. 
May each of their examples be inspi-
ration to all Americans that faithful-
ness to the Constitution and all the 
laws of our land and the hope of our 
Founders is the responsibility of us all 
to bring to our political discourse. 
Bless us this day and every day. May 
all that is done be for Your greater 
honor and glory. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Indiana (Mrs. WALORSKI) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. WALORSKI led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle.

PRESIDENT’S BUDGET 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
President Trump stood in this very 
Chamber last week promising that he 
would protect Medicare and Social Se-
curity, but like so many things with 
this administration, that empty prom-
ise didn’t even last a week. In fact, 
when he sent his budget proposal to 
Congress on Monday, it cut more than 
$1.6 trillion for Medicare, Medicaid, 
and other healthcare programs. It cut 
another $24 billion from Social Secu-
rity. 
As the top 1 percent of wealthy cor-
porations continue to benefit from the 
President’s tax cut, he is now asking 
for you, the American people, to pay 
for it. 
He likes to brag that the stock mar-
ket is up and unemployment is down, 
but what he refuses to acknowledge is 
that the economy isn’t working for 
most working folks. 
Healthcare costs are rising as his ad-
ministration sues the eliminate the 
ACA in its entirety. The cost of living 
is increasing as he tries to cut funding 
for affordable housing. And prescrip-
tion drug prices continue to climb de-
spite our passage of H.R. 3, which is 
collecting dust on MITCH MCCONNELL’s 
desk. 
The President’s budget is nothing 
more than assault on hardworking 
families just trying to keep a roof over 
their heads and put food on their table. 
The American people deserve better. 
House Democrats are going to con-
tinue passing legislation that actually 
gets government working for the peo-
ple again, and the President and MITCH 
MCCONNELL should get off the sidelines 
and join us in this effort. 
f 
ABORTED FETAL REMAINS 
BURIAL 
(Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the 2,411 unborn 
children whose remains were finally 
laid to rest with dignity yesterday in 
South Bend, Indiana. 
These victims of Indiana’s most pro-
lific abortionist would be in their late 
teens now, graduating from high school 
and entering into college, but their in-
nocent lives were cut short, and they 
were denied a proper burial. Instead, 
their remains sat for almost 2 years in 
a garage, a car trunk, in moldy boxes 
and Styrofoam coolers. 
Such callous disregard for human life 
should shake us to the core. These chil-
dren deserve justice and dignity. 
To ensure this never happens again, 
the House must pass the Dignity for 
Aborted Children Act to build on Indi-
ana’s law, upheld by the Supreme 
Court, that requires dignified treat-
ment of aborted fetal remains. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in observing a moment of si-
lence for the thousands of innocent vic-
tims who were laid to rest yesterday. 
f 
VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE TO 
HOLD GUN TRAFFICKERS LIABLE 
(Mr. CASTEN of Illinois asked and 
was given permission to address the

ple lost their lives and many more were

February 13, 2020 
injured when a gunman entered an Au-
rora, Illinois, warehouse and started 
shooting. 
At the vigil for those victims, I made 
it clear that, if we want to stop people 
from getting shot, we have to politicize 
this and we have to take legislative ac-
tion. 
Now, Illinois has some of the strong-
est gun laws in the country, but our 
neighbors don’t. In Chicago, 60 percent 
of the guns recovered from crime 
scenes were trafficked in from out of 
State. And, worse, we have never had 
the courage to regulate guns the same 
way we regulate cars. If my daughter 
took my car out and crashed into my 
neighbor’s garage, I would be liable. 
That is common sense. 
That is why, yesterday, I introduced 
the Gun Trafficker Detention Act. This 
bill requires gun owners to report if 
their gun is lost or stolen within 48 
hours and imposes criminal penalties if 
they fail to do so and their gun turns 
up at a crime scene. It would also allow 
the victims of gun violence to hold 
traffickers legally liable for death or 
injury caused by their guns, regardless 
of who pulled the trigger. 
Are there people who won’t like this 
bill? Yes—gun traffickers. Every other 
American will be safer, and I encourage 
my colleagues to join me and support 
this bill. 
f 
HELPING TO REFORM OUR 
BLOATED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, advanc-
ing the cause of our constitutional Re-
public by adopting policies that restore 
the confidence of the public in the U.S. 
Congress is one of the goals I have had 
since my election last November. 
The current lack of confidence is 
largely due to the dysfunction, par-
tisanship, and distrust that is so preva-
lent. That is why I am proud to work 
together with my colleagues who are 
on the Republican Study Committee 
government reform task force and who 
are committed to helping reform our 
bloating Federal Government in order 
to expand opportunities for all Ameri-
cans. 
Congress was established through Ar-
ticle I of the U.S. Constitution, and, as 
such, our Founding Fathers put the ut-
most responsibility in lawmakers to 
uphold their inalienable rights and to 
maintain proper transparency while 
doing so. 
Sadly, today’s Congress has strayed 
far from that through Federal over-
reach. This makes the task force even 
more timely and important. 
The three main focuses of this task 
force are reforming government power 
structures, practices, and personnel 
policies. Each of these categories has a 
considerable amount of reform that 
would be meaningful and effective if 
enacted. 
I am committed to ensuring the be-
liefs of our Founding Fathers live on 
today through Congress’ actions by re-
forming government so that it truly 
serves the people for whom it was cre-
ated and by whom it is empowered. 
f 
PFAS WATER CONTAMINATION 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, PFAS 
water 
contamination 
continues 
to 
threaten the purity of our drinking 
water and the health of our commu-
nities, including my own. 
FAS contaminants exist on more 
than 400 military bases nationwide and 
threaten the health and safety of those 
who live nearby. This public health cri-
sis demands our full attention and re-
quires a national solution. 
This 116th Congress has proposed and 
passed more PFAS legislation than any 
previous Congress in history, including 
the PFAS Action Act, which would re-
quire the EPA to enforce cleanup of 
contaminated sites and require a na-
tionwide PFAS drinking water stand-
ard. 
Still much work remains to be done. 
We must stand up for stronger regula-
tions, cleaner water, and healthier 
communities. 
Clean drinking water cannot be an-
other issue that the Senate majority 
continues to ignore and add to their 
graveyard. We have an obligation to 
address this national health crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the Senate, 
including 
my 
own 
Senators, 
to 
prioritize the well-being of our commu-
nities and to act swiftly on the passage 
of the PFAS Action Act. 
f 
BRINGING 
JUSTICE 
TO 
MISSING 
AND MURDERED NATIVE AMER-
ICAN WOMEN 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, in 
advance of the fifth annual Missing and 
Murdered Indigenous Women’s Memo-
rial March that is taking place in my 
hometown of Duluth, Minnesota, to-
morrow, I rise to bring attention to the 
violence facing our Native American 
communities. 
Everyone has a right to live safely in 
their communities, but the murder 
rate of Native American women is cur-
rently 10 times the national average. 
More than half of Native American 
women have been sexually assaulted, 
and thousands of Native American 
women and girls have gone missing. 
This national crisis has been ignored 
for far too long, and it is time that 
Congress acts. That is why I cospon-
sored Savanna’s Act, legislation that 
would better prepare Tribal law en-
forcement to respond to these crimes. I 
believe that this should be one of the 
easiest bills that we pass this year and 
call for its quick passage. 
Madam Speaker, I will be proud to 
march with our Native American com-
munities this Friday and honor those 
we have lost. I believe that, together, 
we can bring justice to the missing and 
murdered indigenous Native American 
women and hold the individuals who 
commit these acts of violence account-
able. 
f 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S 2021 BUDGET 
(Mr. SCHNEIDER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to the irre-
sponsible and immoral budget request 
proposed by President Trump. 
The President’s shameful betrayal of 
Americans most in need of vital serv-
ices comes just days after he stood in 
this very Chamber and promised he 
would protect them. 
A budget reveals our priorities, and 
this document makes clear President 
Trump does not prioritize hardworking 
Americans and their families. Once 
again, the President goes out of his 
way to target Americans’ access to 
healthcare and affordable education. 
In the President’s upside-down budg-
et, $500 billion is stripped from Medi-
care, $900 billion from Medicaid. Stu-
dent loan funding is cut by $170 billion. 
Public Service Loan Forgiveness would 
be completely eliminated. More than 
$200 billion would be cut from the 
SNAP program, the safety net for fami-
lies facing temporary challenges put-
ting food on the table. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
these 
cuts 
are 
wrong, and the House must not let 
them go forward. I will continue to 
work with my colleagues in Congress 
to protect these critical programs that 
our seniors, working families, young 
people, and children depend on.

RECOGNIZING 
ARIZONA’S 
BIRTH-
DAY AND 108TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF STATEHOOD 
(Mrs. LESKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize my home State of 
Arizona’s birthday and our 108th anni-
versary of statehood. 
Since February 14, 1912, the great 
State of Arizona has welcomed those 
who wish to experience a life of pros-
perity, opportunity, growth, and a cul-
ture second to none. 
Every year people from all the over 
the world come to Arizona to experi-
ence our State’s treasured beauty, and, 
of course, the five C’s. 
I know I speak for all of us who live 
in Arizona when I say we are incredibly 
grateful to call the Grand Canyon 
State our home. Our State motto 
means ‘‘God Enriches.’’ Arizona is 
proof of that.

RECOGNIZING TRIBAL LEADERS 
(Mr. RUIZ asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Tribal leaders from 
around the country gathered in Wash-
ington, D.C., for the National Congress 
of American Indians’ 2020 Winter Exec-
utive Session. 
NCAI was founded in 1944 with the 
mission to protect and enhance the 
sovereign rights of Tribal nations and 
to secure a prosperous future for Na-
tive communities. 
In fact, initially, NCAI had to fight 
against many restrictions and injus-
tices perpetrated by this very body. It 
is this complicated and challenging 
history that is the backdrop of the 
work we do here today. 
It is important, then, that the United 
States Government works to honor 
Tribal sovereignty, promote self-deter-
mination, and fulfill the trust responsi-
bility to Native Tribes. 
We must also pass advanced appro-
priations for the Indian Health Service 
and provide resources to upgrade the 
roads, schools, and internet access 
across Indian Country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge the House to 
take up these issues immediately and 
do our part to support our Tribal part-
ners.

HONORING JOE BONAMASSA 
(Mr. WITTMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize and honor Joe 
Bonamassa. He is one of the most gift-
ed, talented, and accomplished singers, 
songwriters, and guitarists in modern- 
day blues music. 
Joe works incredibly hard to give 
back. Joe has founded the Keeping the 
Blues Alive Foundation. This founda-
tion fuels a passion for music by fund-
ing projects and scholarships to allow 
students and teachers the resources 
and tools that they need to further 
music education. 
Joe also gives back in other ways. He 
is an aficionado of guitars and has a 
vast collection that he uses to extend 
music history. And he allows people to 
come and visit his collection of guitars 
and amplifiers in a place he calls 
Nerdville, California. 
Joe has done an incredible amount 
for music, for music history, and to ad-
vance the cause of music having an im-
pact in an increasing number of peo-
ple’s lives. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing and honoring Joe Bonamassa 
for his contributions to the world of 
music. 
REMOVING DEADLINE FOR RATIFI-
CATION 
OF 
EQUAL 
RIGHTS 
AMENDMENT 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 844, I call up 
the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 79) re-
moving the deadline for the ratifica-
tion of the equal rights amendment, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WEXTON). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 844, the amendment in the nature 
of a substitute recommended by the 
Committee on the Judiciary, printed in 
the joint resolution, is adopted and the 
joint resolution, as amended, is consid-
ered read. 
The text of the joint resolution, as 
amended, is as follows: 
H.J. RES. 79 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, That notwithstanding 
any time limit contained in House Joint Res-
olution 208, 92d Congress, as agreed to in the 
Senate on March 22, 1972, the article of 
amendment proposed to the States in that 
joint resolution shall be valid to all intents 
and purposes as part of the United States 
Constitution whenever ratified by the legis-
latures of three-fourths of the several States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
joint resolution, as amended, shall be 
debatable for 1 hour, equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on the Judiciary. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. COLLINS) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.J. Res. 
79. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, this is long-overdue 
legislation to ensure that the equal 
rights amendment can finally become 
the 28th amendment to the United 
States Constitution. 
This year, we will celebrate the 100th 
anniversary of women gaining the 
right to vote. Despite the century that 
has elapsed, our Constitution still does 
not recognize or guarantee full equal 
protection of the law for women and 
gender minorities, but H.J. Res. 79 
would bring us one step closer. 
The resolution removes the previous 
deadline Congress set for ratifying the 
ERA and will, therefore, ensure that 
recent ratifications by Nevada, Illinois, 
and Virginia are given full effect. 
The ERA offers a basic and funda-
mental guarantee: Equality of rights 
under the law shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by 
any State on account of sex. 
That is it. Very simple. 
In the years since it was passed by 
overwhelming bipartisan majorities in 
the House and the Senate, we have 
made great strides to secure that 
equality, including through existing 
case law decided under the 14th Amend-
ment. 
The ERA would enshrine those prin-
ciples and take the final critical step of 
ensuring 
that 
laws 
disadvantaging 
women and gender minorities are sub-
ject to the most rigorous form of con-
stitutional scrutiny. 
In recent years, we have seen a series 
of breakthroughs for women’s rights 
and gender equality. We have seen mil-
lions of women march in support of 
their rights and dignity as equal citi-
zens. Through the #MeToo movement, 
we have had long-overdue and some-
times painful conversations about the 
violence and harassment that women 
and 
gender 
minorities 
experience, 
whether in the workplace, at home, or 
in schools and universities. 
We have seen women get elected to 
Congress in record numbers. And just 
weeks ago, Virginia became the nec-
essary 38th and the last necessary 
State to ratify the equal rights amend-
ment. We are on the brink of making 
history, and no deadline should stand 
in the way. 
The Constitution itself places no 
deadlines on the process for ratifying 
constitutional amendments, making it 
doubtful whether Congress had the au-
thority to impose such a deadline in 
the first place. But if it had such au-
thority, then Congress clearly also has 
the authority to remove any deadline 
that it previously chose to set. 
I want to thank Representative JACK-
IE SPEIER for introducing this resolu-
tion, which takes that important step. 
This resolution will ensure, at long 
last, the equal rights amendment, hav-
ing been proposed by Congress years 
ago, having now been ratified by three- 
quarters of the States, can take its 
rightful place as part of our Nation’s 
Constitution. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, three-quarters of the States 
failed to ratify the equal rights amend-
ment by the 1979 deadline set by Con-
gress, yet House Democrats are trying 
to retroactively revive the failed con-
stitutional amendment. 
Congress does not have the power to 
do that. Congress set the deadline; it 
was passed; it did not get approved; and 
now there is an end run to go around 
that. 
The United States Supreme Court 
recognized this in 1982 when it stated 
that the issue was moot because the 
deadline for ERA ratification expired 
before the requisite number of States 
approved it. 
The next year, the Democratic lead-
ership in the House of Representatives,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1130 
February 13, 2020 
acting on the same understanding, 
started the entire process of ERA ap-
proval over again. But that new ERA 
also failed to achieve the required two- 
thirds majority in the House on No-
vember 15, 1983. 
But today, in defiance of historical 
reality and the clear acceptance of the 
situation by all relevant participants 
in the original debate, the Democrats 
have brought forward a resolution that 
denies the obvious. Now, the pro-
ponents of this resolution want to con-
vince their base that if both Houses of 
Congress pass this joint resolution, and 
it is signed into law, the 1972 ERA will 
become part of the Constitution just 
because the Democrats control the Vir-
ginia State legislature and that legis-
lature passed the ERA this year. 
Even current Supreme Court Justice 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg—and she is tak-
ing a lot of heat for this—a supporter 
of ERA since its beginning, has said, 
just a few months ago: 
I hope someday we will start all over again 
on the ERA, collecting the necessary States 
to ratify it. 
On Monday of this week, Justice 
Ginsburg said of the ERA: 
I would like to see a new beginning. I 
would like to see it start over. There is too 
much controversy about latecomers—Vir-
ginia, long after the deadline passed. Plus a 
number of States have withdrawn their rati-
fication. So if you count a latecomer on the 
plus side, how can you disregard States that 
said: We have changed our minds. 
Congress does not have the constitu-
tional authority to retroactively revive 
the failed constitutional amendment 
and to subject the citizens of all 50 
States to what may be the current po-
litical trends in just one State. 
The U.S. Supreme Court has already 
recognized that. Past Democratic lead-
erships of the House have recognized 
that. Justice Ginsburg has recognized 
that. 
But 
apparently, 
the 
current 
Democratic leadership is intent on re-
writing history. 
As we have our debate today, I will 
show, and our speakers will show, what 
the real intent about this is, and it has 
nothing to do with equal rights. It has 
a lot to do with other issues that will 
be exposed today. 
With that, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. I yield 3 minutes to 
the distinguished gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. SPEIER), the chief spon-
sor of this bill. 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his extraor-
dinary leadership on this issue. 
This 
is 
very 
simple, 
Members. 
Women want to be equal, and we want 
it in the Constitution. 
I am equal on this House floor with 
all of my male colleagues, but when I 
walk out, I have fewer rights and pro-
tections than them. 
I rise today because the women of 
America are done being second-class 
citizens. We are done being paid less for 
our work, done being violated with im-
punity, 
done 
being 
discriminated 
against for our pregnancies, done being 
discriminated against simply because 
we are women. 
The ERA is about equality. The ERA 
is about sisterhood, motherhood, sur-
vival, dignity, and respect. 
The world recognizes this. Of the 193 
countries in the United Nations, 165 
have put this kind of language in their 
constitutions, 
but 
not 
the 
United 
States of America. 
From the Women’s March to the 
#MeToo movement to the pink wave, 
the outrage we have seen among 
women 
is 
because 
we 
have 
been 
disrespected, devalued, and diminished 
in our society. And we are fed up. 
It is no wonder recent votes to ratify 
the ERA came in 2017, 2018, and 2020, 
because we want the ERA now. We 
have waited for almost a century for 
the ERA. 
I want to thank my Republican co-
sponsors of this resolution, including 
Congressmen Reed, Fitzpatrick, and 
Van Drew. 
I know most of you recognize that 
this is the right thing to do for your 
wives, daughters, and granddaughters. 
Ninety-four percent of Americans al-
ready support the ERA. In fact, they 
are surprised it is not already in the 
Constitution. 
Now, some of you will say just re-
start the process, but you are the same 
people who admit you won’t vote for it. 
Some will say, ‘‘Well, women already 
have equality,’’ while they vote against 
VAWA reauthorization, vote against 
paycheck fairness, chip away at title 
IX. 
For too long, women have relied on 
the patchwork quilt of laws and prece-
dents. We have put our lives on the 
line. We have been forced to take our 
cases all the way to the Supreme 
Court, and often, there, we lose. 
For my colleagues who think we al-
ready have women’s equality, talk to 
Christy Brzonkala, who was raped by 
two football players at Virginia Tech. 
She sought justice under the Violence 
Against Women Act, but the Supreme 
Court struck down the civil suit provi-
sions, claiming Congress lacked the au-
thority to pass it. 
Talk to Lilly Ledbetter, who had to 
rely on an anonymous note to learn she 
was paid less than her male colleagues 
at Goodyear. 
Talk to Betty Duke, who was passed 
over for promotions and paid $10,000 
less for her work at Walmart. 
Talk to Peggy Young, who was 
placed on unpaid leave, losing her 
health insurance, while pregnant, at 
UPS, all the while men were granted 
the exact same accommodation that 
she was denied. 
The ERA is about building the Amer-
ica we want. It is about forming a more 
perfect Union because, simply put, 
there can be no expiration date on 
equality. 
I urge my colleagues to affirm their 
support for women’s equality and vote 
for this resolution. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO). 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I am a 
woman, so I obviously care and support 
equal rights for women. But I oppose 
this bill for three reasons. 
First, the bill is not constitutional. 
When the ERA originally passed Con-
gress, it explicitly set a deadline for 
ratification. The deadline was in 1979, 
almost 41 years ago. Only 35 States of 
the 38 needed had ratified it. Then five 
States unratified it. So the count is 
down to 30. Thus, the equal rights 
amendment was dead. 
The U.S. Department 
of 
Justice 
issued a legal opinion just last month, 
reiterating that the ERA’s ratification 
timeline is expired. 
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Gins-
burg said: 
The deadline passed. I would like to see a 
new beginning. I would like it to start over. 
Secondly, the ERA is not necessary. 
Women’s equality of rights under the 
law is already recognized in our Con-
stitution in the Fifth and 14th Amend-
ments. The ACLU’s women’s rights di-
rector wrote: ‘‘It has been clearly un-
derstood that the 14th Amendment pro-
hibits discrimination based on sex.’’ 
Plus, many Federal, State, and local 
laws already prohibit sex discrimina-
tion. 
The third reason I oppose this bill: If 
ratified, the ERA would be used by pro- 
abortion groups to undo pro-life legis-
lation and lead to more abortions and 
taxpayer funding of abortions. 
But don’t take my word for it. Let’s 
look at what pro-abortion groups have 
done and what they say. 
In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme 
Court ruled unanimously that the 
State’s ERA required the State to fund 
abortions. NARAL Pro-Choice Amer-
ica, which supports abortions, asserted 
that the ERA would reinforce the con-
stitutional right to abortion and would 
require judges to strike down anti- 
abortion laws. 
In a 2019 letter to the House Judici-
ary Committee, the ACLU stated: The 
equal rights amendment could provide 
an 
additional 
layer 
of 
protection 
against restrictions on abortion. 
In conclusion, this bill is unconstitu-
tional. The ERA is unnecessary, since 
constitutional Federal, State, and local 
laws already guarantee equal protec-
tions. And the ERA, if ratified, would 
be used by pro-abortion groups to undo 
pro-life laws. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. 
NADLER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
again, the deadline was not part of the 
amendment. It was a resolution by 
Congress. And if Congress can set a 
deadline, it can remove a deadline. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader of the House. 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
b 0930 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1131 
February 13, 2020 
I thank Representative SPEIER, Rep-
resentative MALONEY, and all of those 
who have been such warriors on this 
issue for such a long period of time. 
They are keeping the faith. 
This constitutional amendment was 
passed in 1972, to be specific, in the 
early part of 1972. I was a member of 
the Maryland State Senate in 1972, and 
I had the honor in the late spring of 
1972, just months after the ERA had 
been passed, of voting to ratify that. 
Now, the previous speaker said in 
only 35 States. That is 70 percent of the 
States ratified that in a timely fash-
ion. Timely in the sense that we set in 
a resolution, as the chairman pointed 
out, a date. Seventy percent of the 
States of this Nation. 
Now, it needed three more States. It 
has now received three more States. I 
have been an advocate for the equal 
rights amendment for essentially 4 dec-
ades, actually longer. I will be proud to 
vote for it today. 
Just a few months, as I said, after 
Congress adopted the ERA, Maryland 
voted for ratification. I thought that it 
was long overdue even then in 1972. 
Here we are some 48 years later, and it 
still is. 
Our Founders declared ‘‘all men are 
created equal’’ in their Declaration of 
Independence. Surely, no Founder, if 
they 
were 
writing 
that 
document 
today, would have said ‘‘men’’ meant 
white, property-owning men. Surely, 
they would not have written that. 
Surely, none of us would have sup-
ported that. 
Since the very beginning Americans 
have been taking steps, therefore, to 
define that in a more expansive, inclu-
sive term representing our universal 
values. We amended the Constitution 
to 
ensure 
African 
Americans 
and 
women could not be denied the right to 
vote. It took a long time. Particularly, 
I hope the women in this body will 
think of the suffragettes who were ex-
traordinarily active and involved in 
our community and making decisions 
in our families and in our communities 
and country but who could not vote 
prior to 1919. 
From 1789 to 1919 women could not 
vote. I am the father of three daugh-
ters, the grandfather of two grand-
daughters, and the great-grandfather of 
three great-granddaughters. For me to 
go home to them tonight and say I 
voted against your being equal in 
America. Now, my wife passed away, 
but if I went home to her tonight and 
said I voted against your being equal in 
America or those grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren 
who 
happen 
to 
have been born as women and say to 
them I voted against your being equal 
in America today. 
We passed the Civil Rights Act to 
make clear that all must be treated 
equal regardless of race. We passed the 
ADA, which I cosponsored 30 years ago 
to ban discrimination against those 
with disabilities. But still nowhere in 
our Constitution does it state clearly 
that women must be treated equally 
and that one must not be subject to 
discrimination because of their gender. 
The ERA would enshrine that basic 
tenant of our democracy in our Con-
stitution at long last. Seventy percent 
of the States and then three more said 
that ought to be in our Constitution. 
Three-quarters of the States have 
voted to ratify this amendment. 
Discrimination against women has 
through our history kept bright and 
talented Americans from achieving 
their full potential in our economy. Be-
cause of their hard work, the sacrifices, 
the leadership, and the perseverance of 
trailblazing women, we have seen bar-
riers come down, doors of opportunity 
open, and glass ceilings shatter. 
Discrimination, inequality, and in-
justice persist, and we will hear argu-
ments on this floor rationalizing why 
discrimination ought to still exist. And 
as long as our Constitution does not 
explicitly ban discrimination based 
upon gender as it does based on race, 
we will continue to see forms of legal 
discrimination against women linger in 
our country. 
Taking this step to add the equal 
rights amendment to the Constitution 
is one of the many that House Demo-
crats are taking to combat discrimina-
tion against women simply because 
they are women. 
Last year, we passed the Paycheck 
Fairness Act. Not everybody voted for 
that, but, in my opinion, everybody 
voted for that who thought equal pay 
should mean equal pay, irrespective of 
gender and based upon work performed. 
That built on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair 
Pay Act of 2009 to ensure equal pay for 
equal work. 
We also passed the reauthorization of 
the Violence Against Women Act. Most 
of us on our side voted for that, but 
there was a rationalization why some 
thought, no, we will not protect women 
against violence. 
We have continued working to pro-
tect women’s rights to make their own 
healthcare choices and to access qual-
ity affordable care. 
Who said that was part of the Con-
stitution? 
The Supreme Court of the United 
States. They said that was a constitu-
tional right and we see effort after ef-
fort to erode that constitutional right. 
I am proud that the Democratic Cau-
cus in the 116th Congress is not only 
the most diverse in American history, 
but also includes the greatest number 
of women. 
In Virginia, it was an election that 
saw the house of delegates reach 30 per-
cent women and the State senate reach 
28 percent. Once it got there, the 
women of Virginia stood up and said 
this ought to be in the Constitution of 
the United States, and they voted to do 
so. Virginia now has a woman speaker 
of the house, as we do in our U.S. 
House, and as my home State of Mary-
land has in our house of delegates. It is 
because more women are stepping up to 
run for office and winning elections 
that more women’s voices are being 
heard in our democracy. 
That is why this resolution is on the 
floor. That is a wonderful thing, and I 
have been proud to help recruit tal-
ented women to run for the House as 
Democrats. And very frankly, we need 
more women as Republicans, a dimin-
ishing group, I might add. 
I urge my colleagues, men and 
women, Democrats and Republicans, to 
join in supporting this resolution. 
And, finally, is it too late? 
It is too late. But it is never too late 
to do the right thing. 
Make this part of our Constitution. 
Stand up and say, yes, women should 
be included as all humankind who are 
endowed by their creator with certain 
unalienable rights. That is the prin-
ciple that we are articulating today. 
Alice Paul, who first wrote the ERA 
and campaigned for it for most of her 
life was once asked why she kept all 
her focus on getting the job done, and 
she said this, ‘‘When you put your hand 
to the plow, you can’t put it down until 
you get to the end of the row.’’ We are 
not at the end of the row, but this is a 
way upon that row to make it complete 
to make our Constitution protect all 
people, male or female, Black or white, 
all people. 
At long last, let’s hold firm to that 
plow. Let’s get the job done. Vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this resolution. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER). 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today to commend the women 
who have gone before us to celebrate 
the achievements that women have 
made and to reaffirm the fact that we 
are equal in the eyes of God and in law. 
Women make up 51 percent of the 
population, comprise over half of the 
college students, make up most of to-
day’s medical and law school students 
and own the majority of new busi-
nesses. 
Women are not victims in need of 
validation. Little girls can be whatever 
they want to be, whether that be an as-
tronaut, a doctor, a full-time mom 
working at home, or a member of Con-
gress. 
In addition, Federal law and court 
precedent uphold our rights. That is 
something to applaud, and I do. How-
ever, today’s legislation is problematic 
on several fronts. 
First, the resolution is unconstitu-
tional. The time limit to pass the ERA 
expired decades ago. Congress can’t go 
back and remove a deadline from a pre-
vious constitutional amendment initia-
tive. The Supreme Court has recog-
nized that the 1972 ERA expired, and 
the Department of Justice issued a rul-
ing saying Congress may not revive a 
proposed amendment after a deadline 
for its ratification has expired. Pre-
tending that we can remove the time 
limits for passage is both futile and de-
ceptive. 
Secondly, if the time limit could be 
extended, the ERA would not bring

February 13, 2020 
women any more rights than they cur-
rently have right now, but it would en-
trench the legality of abortion. We 
know this from court precedent by lis-
tening to those who have the most to 
gain from constitutionally protecting 
abortion on demand. 
In 1998, the New Mexico Supreme 
Court ruled that the equal rights 
amendment in their State constitution 
requires State funding of abortions. 
Federal courts are likely to do the 
same. Perhaps that is why every pro- 
abortion organization is endorsing pas-
sage of the ERA. 
NARAL Pro-Choice America says, 
‘‘With its ratification, the ERA would 
reinforce the constitutional right to 
abortion.’’ 
The 
National 
Organization 
for 
Women says, ‘‘An ERA—properly inter-
preted—could negate the hundreds of 
laws that have passed restricting ac-
cess to abortion. . . . ‘’ 
But that is not the only concern with 
passing this resolution. Besides being 
unconstitutional and shredding State 
and Federal pro-life protections, the 
ERA would also erase decades of 
progress which have provided opportu-
nities for women, advance women’s 
progress through Federal programs, 
and secure necessary protections for 
women and girls. 
How? By incorporating gender iden-
tity in the definition of sex, jeopard-
izing private spaces for women, girls’ 
sports programs, and women’s edu-
cational institutions. 
The ERA endangers laws, programs, 
and funding designed to benefit women 
providing a pathway for legal chal-
lenges to welfare programs, grants for 
battered women’s shelters, efforts to 
bolster women participating in STEM 
programs, as well as State laws gov-
erning child support, alimony, and cus-
tody. These outcomes are anything but 
pro women. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 
79, which takes a key step to ensure 
that the equal rights amendment will 
become part of our Constitution. 
Nearly 100 years after women gained 
the right to vote, it is difficult to be-
lieve we still haven’t given women 
equal rights. It is hard to believe it is 
a serious disagreement in this Cham-
ber. 
In the year 2020, it is unacceptable 
that women still make only 80 cents 
for every dollar earned by men and 
that women are still subject to vio-
lence, harassment and attacks on their 
freedom to control their own bodies. 
In Judiciary Committee this morn-
ing, a brilliant female law clerk is de-
scribing sexual harassment by a distin-
guished and respected ninth circuit 
judge. This should never happen. And 
with ongoing efforts to undermine 
progress we have made; the equal 
rights amendment is more important 
than ever. 
It took over 130 years to give women 
the right to vote. It is almost 100 years 
since they have gotten it. It is time to 
give women their proper place in the 
Constitution of the United States, 
which most modern constitutions have, 
equality regardless of sex. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mrs. 
WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 79. 
Of course, I believe in equal rights. 
Women should never face discrimina-
tion and harassment. I believe we 
should be empowering women and girls 
to achieve their dreams. 
So it is disappointing today to stand 
in this Chamber and see this important 
issue turned into some type of political 
stunt. The deadline for States to ratify 
the ERA passed nearly 4 decades ago. 
Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has 
stated the only path forward is to start 
over. 
Let’s be honest, this is not about 
equality or women’s rights. This is 
about enshrining unrestricted abortion 
in the Constitution and allowing full 
taxpayer funding for abortion. Now is 
not the time to be weakening pro-life 
protections. 
Yesterday, in South Bend, Indiana, in 
my district, the remains of 2,411 vic-
tims of abortion were finally given a 
dignified burial after spending 20 years 
in moldy Styrofoam boxes in the back 
of the doctor/abortionist’s car and in 
his basement. 
b 0945 
These unborn boys and girls would be 
young men and women today entering 
college. 
Moments ago, we stood on this House 
floor together and we offered a moment 
of silence that these innocent lives 
were taken and there were victims, 
over 2,400. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask that, 
together, we stand again to defend the 
rights of the most vulnerable among 
us, that we stand together today for 
the sanctity of life, to lift women up, 
to protect women, and to strengthen 
families. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting against 
this misguided resolution. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, 
with Virginia becoming the 38th State 
to ratify the equal rights amendment, 
today we make it clear that Congress 
never intended the arbitrary deadline 
to act as a barrier to ratification of 
this vital amendment. 
Ratification 
of 
the 
equal 
rights 
amendment affirms our Nation’s values 
by codifying an expressed prohibition 
against sex discrimination in our Na-
tion’s foundational document. 
While our Nation’s courts have prop-
erly recognized that women are enti-
tled to equal protection under the law, 
we have a responsibility to do all that 
we can to guarantee that, regardless of 
sex, all Americans are treated the same 
in every aspect of their lives, including 
making a living, obtaining healthcare, 
and accessing public services. 
These rights must not be swayed by 
political ideology or depend on judicial 
philosophy. Equality is a founding 
value of this great country and, more 
than any other word, describes the 
very idea of America. 
Madam Speaker, a vote for H.J. Res. 
79 is a vote for equality. I urge my col-
leagues to support H.J. Res. 79. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin, (Mr. SENSEN-
BRENNER). 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
resolution. 
Listening to people on the other side 
say that there is a cornucopia of bene-
fits awaiting women should the ERA 
become a part of the Constitution, I am 
here to ask Members on both sides of 
the aisle to look past what looks nice 
on a bumper sticker or a 40-second 
sound bite to realize that there are 
going to be many consequences that 
will hurt women should this be rati-
fied. I will just talk about insurance, 
because insurance is regulated by the 
States. 
Girls get substantially lower rates on 
auto insurance because they are better 
drivers. With the ERA and the State 
regulation, that would become uncon-
stitutional, and girls are going to have 
to pay boy drivers’ rates for auto insur-
ance, which really does not reflect the 
actuarial exposure of that at all. 
Secondly, look at life insurance. 
Women live longer than men and, as a 
result, in life insurance, also regulated 
by the States, you see women’s rates 
being lower than men’s rates becoming 
unconstitutional, and women are going 
to be paying more to life insurance 
companies for the coverage that they 
decide on. 
I could go on and on and on. We had 
a lot of hearings on this in 1973. 
I am here to say that, when the ERA 
was originally passed in 1972, women’s 
rights were not enshrined in a lot of 
State laws. There has been tremendous 
progress in this area both at the Fed-
eral level and in the States. The pro-
ponents of this resolution completely 
ignore that happening. We don’t. 
We think that the statutory protec-
tions that have been passed all around 
the country in the last almost 50 years 
have advanced women and have ad-
dressed a lot of the complaints that we 
hear from that side of the aisle. 
This is going to unleash a Pandora’s 
box of lots of litigation that has been 
raised by this, some of which has been 
brought up by my colleagues on this 
side.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1133 
February 13, 2020 
Let’s not enrich the lawyers. Let’s do 
the right thing. Don’t pass this resolu-
tion. Enforce the laws that have been 
passed both here and in the State cap-
itols. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank all of the women of America. I 
thank the sponsor of this bill. I thank 
the chairman of the Judiciary Com-
mittee and the ranking member for 
being on the floor. I thank him. 
I ask the question: Does anybody see 
the sense of women not being in the 
most powerful document of laws and 
power of the American people? 
Let us be reminded of the words of 
Abigail Adams: ‘‘I long to hear that 
you have declared an independency. 
And, by the way, in the new code of 
laws’’—which she is saying to her hus-
band—‘‘which I suppose it will be nec-
essary for you to make, I desire you 
would remember the ladies and be 
more generous and favorable to them 
than your ancestors. Do not put such 
unlimited power into the hands of the 
husbands.’’ 
I rise enthusiastically to support H.J. 
Res. 79 and to say to my colleagues 
there is no constitutional prohibition 
for passing this. 
We are grandly involved because this 
is the 1972 passage by the State of 
Texas of the equal rights amendment. 
And here, in 1977, Betty Friedan and 
Bella Abzug were in Houston at the 
1977 National Women’s Conference that 
our predecessor, Barbara Jordan, was 
at. 
Let us pass H.J. Res. 79, because, as 
Abigail Adams said, let’s remember the 
ladies. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary and an original co-
sponsor, I rise in strong and enthusiastic sup-
port of H.J. Res. 79, which eliminates the rati-
fication deadline for the Equal Rights Amend-
ment and will lead to the long overdue adding 
of the ERA as the 28th Amendment to the 
United States Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I am reminded of the im-
perative powerfully expressed on March 31, 
1776 in Braintree, Massachusetts in a letter 
from Abigail Adams, the future First Lady, to 
her husband John Adams: 
I long to hear that you have declared an 
independency—and by the way in the new 
Code of Laws which I suppose it will be nec-
essary for you to make I desire you would 
Remember the Ladies, and be more generous 
and favourable to them than your ancestors. 
Do not put such unlimited power into the 
hands of the Husbands. 
The resolution before us will help enshrine 
for all time the belief, promise, and commit-
ment that all men, and women, are created 
equal and endowed with by the Creator with 
the same inalienable rights to life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
We are making real this promise thanks to 
the bipartisan resolution introduced by Con-
gresswoman Spiers of California. 
The Constitution does not prohibit the action 
we are taking; in fact, it permits it since ratifi-
cation deadlines are not even mentioned, 
much less imposed by the Constitution. This 
resolution reinforces that, the previous dead-
line is no bar to passing the ERA. 
Under Article V of the Constitution, the 
Equal Rights Amendment ‘‘shall be valid to all 
intents and purposes whenever ratified by the 
legislatures of three-fourths of the several 
states.’’ 
A resolution identical to H.J. Res. 79 has 
been introduced in the United States Senate, 
which I call upon the Senate to take up and 
pass forthwith. 
Madam Speaker, it is useful to review how 
we arrived at this moment in history. 
Beginning in the late 1960s, the National 
Organization for Women (NOW) devised and 
began implementing a strategy of pushing for 
equal rights through a combination of impact 
litigation and advocacy for the Equal Rights 
Amendment. 
I remember this particularly well because in 
November 1977, the first National Women’s 
Conference was held in Houston, Texas and 
attended my congressional predecessor, the 
Honorable Barbara Jordan. 
The National Women’s Conference was in-
spired by a 1975 United Nations-sponsored 
event from two years prior which led President 
Gerald Ford to establish a national commis-
sion to investigate women’s issues. 
Congress later voted to provide $5 million to 
fund the organization of regional conferences 
and to hold a national gathering at the conclu-
sion, the result of these efforts was the Na-
tional Women’s Conference meant to unite all 
women and give them an opportunity to voice 
their hopes for the future of the government. 
I remember that Phyllis Schlafly of the con-
servative Eagle Forum organized and came to 
Houston to lead backlash demonstration pro-
testing the ERA and the women’s movement, 
claiming that the ERA would force women to 
give up their right to be supported by their 
husbands, and subject them to the military. 
draft and deployment to Vietnam. 
That was the launch of the conservative 
counter-offensive to derail ratification of the 
ERA and the beginning of the schism that has 
seen equality between the sexes and expand-
ing the economic, privacy, and political rights 
of women subject to increasing partisan de-
bate and action that is continues to the 
present day. 
In 1970, Congresswoman Martha Griffiths of 
Michigan filed a discharge petition in the 
House to bring the ERA to the floor, after the 
Judiciary Committee consistently refused to 
act on it. 
The discharge petition was adopted, and the 
ERA passed the House by a wide margin. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee also held 
several days of hearings in 1970 on its version 
of the ERA but it failed to gain enough votes 
that year. 
On October 12, 1971, the House voted by 
354–24 to approve a version of the ERA that 
stated: 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled (two-thirds of each 
house concurring therein), that the following 
article is proposed as an amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States, which shall 
be valid to all intents and purposes as part of 
the Constitution when ratified by the legisla-
tures of three-fourths of the several States 
within seven years of its submission by the 
Congress: 
Section 1. Equality of rights under the law 
shall not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or any State on account of sex. 
Section 2. The Congress shall have the 
power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, 
the provisions of this article. 
Section 3. This amendment shall take effect 
two years after the date of ratification. 
On March 22, 1972, the Senate passed the 
ERA by a vote of 84–8. 
The following month, Madam Speaker, I 
graduated from college in the first under-
graduate class of women to attend Yale Uni-
versity in September 1969. 
I was a member of the group of 250 upper- 
class women who transferred to Yale Univer-
sity, a number that eventually led to 1,500 
women being admitted over the years, in addi-
tion to the 4,000 male students. 
Between September 12–14, 1969 under-
graduate women students arrived on campus 
and at that time, 48 of 817 FAS faculty were 
women and only two had tenure. 
I am proud to be a part of the history of 
Yale University and had the opportunity to 
speak about my experience at the 50th Anni-
versary last year. 
The presence of women at Yale, which had 
been an all-male institution was a sign of the 
change that was sweeping the nation. 
I first arrived at Yale with the anticipation 
and anxiety of any college student arriving on 
campus for the first time. 
This was an extraordinary milestone—both 
for Yale and for us young women. 
But being a ‘‘first’’ is not all that people may 
assume that it is. 
In the centennial year of the 19th Amend-
ment, on January 15, 2020, the Virginia Gen-
eral Assembly became the 38th state to vote 
to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, the 
magic number needed to become enshrined in 
the Constitution. 
Because of the ERA, women are finally in-
cluded in our Constitution, making them equal 
to men under law. 
A vote to eliminate the ratification deadline 
for the ERA is a vote for equality; a vote 
against the measure is a vote to preserve the 
legacy of sex discrimination. 
Women will not continue to be second-class 
citizens in their own country. 
The absence of the ERA has meant that 
women can be paid less for their work, vio-
lated with impunity, and discriminated against 
simply for being women. 
Women made up more than 6 in 10 seniors 
who lived in poverty last year, with the poverty 
rate for senior women at 11 percent. 
The average Social Security benefit for 
women 65 and older is about $14,270 per 
year, compared to about $18,375 for men 65 
and older. 
In the 116th Congress, women hold just 
23.6 percent of seats in the U.S. Congress. 
In 2019, just 33 Fortune 500 CEOs are 
women, a new record. 
While women-owned businesses account for 
42 percent of all firms, women-owned busi-
ness account for just 8 percent of the total pri-
vate sector workforce and 4.3 percent of total 
revenue. 
Some legal scholars note the location of the 
deadline in the preamble is important, be-
cause the ERA’s deadline was not part of the 
text that the states voted on when they ratified 
the amendment. 
Other scholars argue that the deadline itself 
is unconstitutional because Article V of the

Constitution does not include mention of dead-
lines. 
A close reading and clear understanding of 
the Constitution leads inescapably to the con-
clusion that when the Framers considered a 
time period to be of the essence, they speci-
fied the time period clearly in the document 
itself. 
Moreover, in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 
433 (1939), the Supreme Court rejected the 
idea that Article V contains an implied limita-
tion period for ratifications. 
Madam Speaker, as a country founded on 
principles of liberty, justice and equality, and a 
global 
leader 
in 
formulating 
international 
human rights standards, the United States 
need to pass the ERA to meet basic stand-
ards for women who are denied equal access 
to legal rights and protections. 
Too many women in the United States 
inexplicably lag behind international human 
rights standards and it is a myth that women 
in the United States already enjoy all of the 
expected standards of rights and protections 
afforded under America. 
The reality is, women in the United States 
experience 
continued 
discrimination 
and 
daunting disparities that prevent them from 
fully participating as equal members of soci-
ety. 
For example, women have risen to some of 
the highest levels of legislative and executive 
representation over the years, yet with 20% of 
Congressional Members and an average of 
24.9% of state legislatures, but the United 
States ranks #72 in the global market of 
women represented in public and political po-
sitions. 
While the number of women justices has 
significantly increased, women litigants’ ac-
cess to justice is severely limited. 
Although women vote in higher percentages 
than men, women’s access to voting is under 
attack in many states where increased voter 
ID requirements and voter purges pose un-
precedented barriers. 
Although women constitute nearly half of the 
US labor force, at a participation rate of 57%, 
equal economic opportunity is severely lacking 
given deficient or nonexistent mandatory 
standards for workplace accommodations for 
pregnant women, post-natal mothers and per-
sons with care responsibilities. 
What also remains a shameful truth in 
America, is the gender wage gap which has 
remained at or near 21% over the past dec-
ade. 
And women with higher levels of education 
experience the largest earning gaps, as do mi-
nority women regardless of educational attain-
ment. 
The percentage of women in poverty has in-
creased over the past decade, from 12.1% to 
14.5%, with a higher rate of poverty than men 
and women are exposed to higher rates of 
homelessness and violence without adequate 
protections in place in shelters and housing 
support options. 
Women in detention facilities throughout the 
country also experience increasingly high 
rates of over-incarceration, sexual violence, 
shackling while pregnant, solitary confinement, 
lack of alternative custodial sentencing for 
women with dependent children, and insuffi-
cient access to health care and re-entry pro-
grams. 
Migrant women traveling to the U.S., many 
victims of trafficking and violence, including 
sexual violence, are kept in detention centers 
with children for prolonged periods of time. 
The U.N. has reported that women, particu-
larly black and LBTQ women, in the U.S. ex-
perience police brutality and increased inci-
dents of homicide by police. 
Even though women own over one-third of 
commercial businesses in the United States, 
primarily in small and medium sized busi-
nesses, these businesses face greater barriers 
in obtaining low cost capital from sources such 
as the SBA—which awards less than 5% of 
federal contracts to women-owned business. 
Finally, one of the most alarming defi-
ciencies for women in America is the inability 
to access basic health care and the imposition 
of devastating barriers to reproductive health 
and rights. 
Too many women are suffering dire and 
deadly consequences. 
Between 1990 and 2013, the maternal mor-
tality rate for women in the U.S. has increased 
by 136%. 
Black women are nearly 4 times more likely 
to die in childbirth, and states with high pov-
erty rates have a 77% higher maternal mor-
tality rate. 
The United States deserves to much better. 
It is unacceptable that women in America 
are facing a health care crisis so dire that the 
global community is denouncing it as a human 
rights violation. 
Sadly, the direction States are taking will 
only further dismantle women’s access to af-
fordable 
and 
trustworthy 
reproductive 
healthcare. 
While clinics are shutting down at drastic 
rates throughout the country, devastating re-
strictions and barriers imposed throughout 
Texas strike at the core of this abomination. 
A Texas statute known as HB2 (House Bill 
2), was enacted several years ago under false 
claims to promote women’s health, when in 
fact it only set in motion dangerous restrictions 
on women’s access to reproductive health 
care. 
In addition to constant attacks on funding for 
reproductive health care clinics, abortion pro-
viders in Texas were forced to undergo impos-
sible million-dollar renovations and upgrades. 
Denying hundreds of thousands of women 
health care services in Texas, nearly half of all 
reproductive health care clinics were forced to 
shut down, and now only 10 remain in the 
second largest state in the country. 
No woman in America should be denied the 
dignity of being ability to make choices about 
her body and healthcare. 
Access to safe, legal and unhindered 
healthcare must be realized by all women. 
These simple facts can no longer be denied, 
and hypocrisy can no longer be tolerated. 
A woman’s personal autonomy over her 
own body and her right to choose whether to 
bear or beget a child is a constitutionally pro-
tected fundamental right. 
More than 40 years ago in the landmark de-
cision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, (1973), 
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 7–2 that the 
right to privacy under the Due Process Clause 
of the 14th Amendment extends to a woman’s 
decision to have an abortion. 
We cannot ignore the obvious hypocrisy of 
imbalanced protection and access to fun-
damentally protected rights for women in 
America when it is easier to purchase and 
lawfully possess a firearm—even for a person 
on the terrorist watchlist—than it is for a 
woman to exercise her constitutional right to 
terminate a pregnancy. 
Madam Speaker, this is not fair, and it is not 
right. 
And with the ERA added to the Constitution, 
it will also not be lawful. 
Madam Speaker, Congress had the author-
ity to extend the deadline and it chose to do 
in 1979; a fortiori, it has the power to eliminate 
the deadline today. 
And that is the right, just, and moral thing to 
do. 
I urge all Members to stand on the right side 
of history and join me in voting to pass H.J. 
Res. 79 so that the Equal Rights Amendment 
can take its rightful place as the 28th Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United States. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Texas (Ms. GRANGER). 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, we 
have heard my Democratic colleagues 
say that passing the equal rights 
amendment is necessary to secure 
basic rights under the law for women. 
Not only is this untrue, it obscures a 
fundamental fact. This ERA actually 
denies the most basic human right: the 
right to life. This ERA uses gender 
equality as a smokescreen to create an 
unlimited constitutional right to abor-
tion. 
Instead of working to craft legisla-
tion that protects women’s rights with-
out trampling on the right to life, 
Democrats have put forward, today, an 
unconstitutional, partisan measure. 
Not only would this result in on-de-
mand abortions across all 50 States, 
but it would also clear the way to pro-
vide 
taxpayer-funded 
abortions 
throughout all 9 months of pregnancy, 
costing millions of dollars every year. 
This measure is not about advancing 
women’s rights, especially as women 
across the country, Republicans and 
Democrats alike, are increasingly hor-
rified by the practice of late-term abor-
tion and by recent comments made in 
New York and Virginia that lifesaving 
treatment should be denied to some 
newborns. 
Allowing women to discard their un-
born children at taxpayer expense is 
not ensuring gender equality. It is not 
protecting women. It is not empow-
ering women. It is not providing 
women equal pay for equal work. It is 
simply another step down the path of 
devaluing all human life and dignity. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
oppose 
this 
amendment and urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this measure. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Chairman NADLER for yield-
ing. 
In Texas, many years ago, I marched 
in support of the equal rights amend-
ment. Today, I join my colleagues to 
reaffirm that support. 
Women are behind some of this Na-
tion’s 
greatest 
achievements. 
We 
fought for civil rights, set athletic 
records, sent men to space, and then 
went there ourselves. We have forged

our paths in history, yet we are still 
not equal to men under the eyes of the 
law. 
We must remove this stain from our 
Constitution. Today, we are voting to 
remove an arbitrary deadline so we can 
finally prohibit gender discrimination 
under the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I will proudly vote 
in favor of the resolution, and I urge 
all my colleagues to do the same. 
As many in my district would say, 
‘‘It is time to approve the ERA.’’ ‘‘Ya 
es hora de aprobar el ERA.’’ 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from West Virginia (Mrs. 
MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to oppose H.J. Res. 79. 
It pains me to say that life is under 
attack in our Nation. The pro-abortion 
discussions taking place around this 
country are sickening. In the last year, 
we heard a Governor promote infan-
ticide, and we saw State legislatures 
take action for the same. 
We still haven’t had a vote on this 
floor in the United States House of 
Representatives to protect babies who 
survive abortion. Yesterday, in com-
mittee, I even introduced legislation 
that would protect babies who survive 
abortion. It failed along party lines 
once again. 
We have millions of American fami-
lies who would love to adopt, yet we 
don’t discuss that. I know women who 
have cried every month when they re-
alized that they had not conceived the 
baby they so desperately wanted. I 
know men and women who have under-
gone multiple tests and procedures just 
to conceive a child. They would gladly 
adopt a baby that someone else didn’t 
want. 
Instead, today, we are voting once 
more on another piece of legislation 
that would drastically reduce protec-
tions for life. This bill would create the 
basis for taxpayer-funded abortion at 
the Federal level, and it would perma-
nently allow abortion until birth for 
any reason throughout the Nation. It 
would 
force 
government-funded 
healthcare providers and hospitals to 
provide abortions. 
We cannot have that. We cannot 
bring abortion into a healthcare debate 
because it is not healthcare. Abortion 
is murder. 
If we want to discuss protecting 
rights for all Americans, it needs to 
pertain to everyone, including and, es-
pecially, newborns. 
While I always welcome a conversa-
tion with my colleagues about how we 
can advance women’s rights and the 
rights of all people, this is not the way 
to do it. It is not through thinly veiled 
messaging bills with nice names but 
radical policies. 
We can pass good pro-woman, pro- 
family, 
pro-American 
legislation 
through bipartisan solutions. 
So if we are going to do it, let’s do it; 
but today, sadly, we won’t, and that is 
so disappointing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mr. 
NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for his leadership. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
equal rights amendment and the reso-
lution before us. 
Today, this body comes together un-
abashed in our conviction for a future 
that expands the vision set forth by our 
Founders. Together, we strive for a na-
tion that advances the notion of equal-
ity, that takes up the mantle of the un-
finished work that is the American 
Dream and the practice of government 
by and for the people—for all the peo-
ple. 
My daughter, Natalie, is just over a 
year-and-a-half old, and I look forward 
to telling her one day about today, how 
the people’s House, led by the Cham-
ber’s first female Speaker, voted to en-
sure that the women of her generation 
will be the first to grow up knowing 
that the Constitution truly guarantees 
equal rights. 
It feels fitting to close by quoting 
Shirley Chisolm, the first Black female 
Member elected to this body and the 
youngest, until my good friend LAUREN 
UNDERWOOD took office last year, who 
said, when Congress sent the ERA to 
the States for ratification: ‘‘The time 
is clearly now to put this House on 
record for the fullest expression of that 
equality of opportunity which our 
Founding Fathers professed. . . . It is 
not too late to complete the work they 
left undone.’’ 
I support the resolution. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
FOXX). 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
Georgia for yielding time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to H.J. Res. 79. 
As a woman who has worked all her 
life, often in male-dominated profes-
sions, I detest discrimination in any 
form against any group, and I have al-
ways done all that I can to eliminate 
it. Furthermore, I welcome any discus-
sion on how to root out discrimination 
against women where it exists. 
But do not be deceived. This is not 
what this legislation is about. 
The 14th Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution already provides women 
and all Americans equal protection 
under the law, but the goal of this leg-
islation is different. The goal here is to 
expand access to abortion up to birth 
and to overturn the broadly supported 
policies that protect taxpayers from 
being forced to pay for abortions. 
b 1000 
As we know all too well, Roe v. Wade 
has broadly legalized abortion in the 
United States, but the equal rights 
amendment that this resolution tries 
to ratify goes much further. 
There is a broad consensus that the 
ERA could be used to overturn pro-life 
laws, legalize abortion up to birth, and 
mandate taxpayer-funded abortions. 
The expansion of abortion is not the 
only harmful impact of the ERA. It 
would have a harmful impact on shel-
ters that protect women from violence, 
eliminate 
women-specific 
workplace 
protections, 
and 
destroy 
women’s 
sports. 
Furthermore, were this resolution 
ever to become law, the Supreme Court 
would undoubtedly rule that it does 
not ratify the equal rights amendment. 
As everyone in this room knows, 
when Congress initially passed the 
equal rights amendment, it inten-
tionally included a 7-year deadline for 
the required 38 States to ratify, a dead-
line which has long since passed. Mul-
tiple States have also rescinded their 
ratification. 
As such, Supreme Court precedent re-
quires that any attempt to ratify the 
ERA must start at the beginning. Even 
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was re-
cently quoted saying she would like 
the process to start over. 
To be perfectly clear, with this reso-
lution, the Democrats are attempting 
to write into the Constitution the right 
to an abortion at all three trimesters, 
force taxpayers to pay for them, and 
eliminate all conscience protections 
for medical providers who wish to ab-
stain from abortion. 
This resolution is not about pro-
tecting women. It is a partisan mes-
saging bill designed to appease radical 
pro-abortion groups. If the majority 
were serious about the equal rights 
amendment, it would start the process 
anew and give all States the option to 
consider the ERA again. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
would remind everyone that the equal 
rights amendment simply says: Equal-
ity of rights under the law shall not be 
denied on account of sex. 
If people on the other side want to 
admit that equality of rights under the 
law means there must be a constitu-
tional right to abortion, well, that is 
wonderful. Of course, the constitu-
tional right to abortion is already es-
tablished under current law. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. 
JAYAPAL. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what a glorious day this is. 
Today, the House of Representatives 
will vote to remove the arbitrary dead-
line to ratify the equal rights amend-
ment. With our vote today, and with 
Virginia’s historic vote to become the 
38th and final State necessary to ratify 
the 
amendment, 
little 
girls, 
their 
moms, and women across this great 
Nation will know that, yes, our Con-
stitution can, will, and must enshrine a 
ban on discrimination on the basis of 
sex. 
Equality of sexes is not debatable. It 
has no expiration date. 
First proposed almost a century ago 
and passed by Congress in 1972, the 
equal rights amendment would be a 
momentous step forward for women to

end unequal pay, pregnancy discrimi-
nation, and sexual harassment and ex-
ploitation. 
So today, to women across this coun-
try who are watching, as the first 
South Asian woman ever elected to the 
House of Representatives, let me say: 
We see you. We stand with you. And we 
will fight for you. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, women have been 
fighting tooth and nail for decades to 
be recognized as equal under the eyes 
of the law. While we made significant 
gains, it is time for a full constitu-
tional equality. 
In 1866, Frances Ellen Watkins Har-
per, a free-born Black woman, ad-
dressed the National Women’s Rights 
Convention in New York City, and she 
said: ‘‘Justice is not fulfilled so long as 
woman is unequal before the law. We 
are all bound up together in one great 
bundle of humanity. . . . Society can-
not afford to neglect the enlighten-
ment of any class of its members.’’ 
These words still hold true today for 
our mothers, for our daughters, and for 
our future leaders. We must take up 
the mantle of the women who came be-
fore us and pass this amendment for a 
more just future. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I am 
so pleased that the gentlewoman from 
Virginia is in the Chair and grateful to 
her for her leadership and our other 
colleagues, ELAINE LURIA and ABIGAIL 
SPANBERGER, as new Members of Con-
gress who give us the opportunity as 
the majority to bring this important 
legislation to the floor. I thank them 
for Virginia’s leadership in all of this. 
It is so appropriate that the Congress-
woman is in the Chair for this because 
she was a leader in the State legisla-
ture on the equal rights amendment 
when she served there. 
This is a historic day, a happy day, as 
the House takes action to move our 
Nation closer to our founding ideal 
that all are created equal. I salute Con-
gresswoman JACKIE
SPEIER
for her 
leadership on this resolution and for 
her lifetime of work to advance equal-
ity in America. 
The gentlewoman quoted the late Su-
preme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, 
and I think it bears repetition. Justice 
Scalia said: ‘‘Certainly the Constitu-
tion does not require discrimination on 
the basis of sex. The only issue is 
whether it prohibits it. It doesn’t.’’ 
It does not prohibit discrimination 
on the basis of sex. The lack of an ERA 
has allowed the Supreme Court Justice 
to have this interpretation. 
Here it is, we say it over and over 
again: Equality of rights under the law 
shall not be denied or abridged by the 
United States or by any State on ac-
count of sex.’’ How can you have a 
problem with that? 
Let 
me 
also 
salute 
Chairwoman 
CAROLYN MALONEY, our longtime lead 
sponsor of the equal rights amendment 
in the House, for her great leadership, 
and Chairman NADLER, the members of 
the Judiciary Committee, and all the 
Members who came to Congress com-
mitted to finishing this fight for the 
equal rights amendment. 
I also want to acknowledge that yes-
terday, at our press presentation on 
this, in the audience was a Republican 
from Illinois who was responsible for 
Illinois passing the equal rights amend-
ment, Steven Andersson. He was with 
us at the Capitol. We commend him for 
being a leader on the ERA, passing it 
through the Illinois statehouse. 
What an honor and how clear that 
this is not partisan, perhaps only in the 
House of Representatives, but not in 
the rest of the country. 
Let us acknowledge the millions of 
women in Nevada, Illinois, Virginia, 
and across America who have raised a 
drumbeat for ratification and reignited 
a nationwide movement for equality. 
Nearly 100 years ago, Alice Paul, a 
Republican, 
introduced 
the 
equal 
rights amendment, the first proposed 
amendment to the Constitution calling 
for women’s equality in America. 
Fifty years ago, soon after becoming 
the first African American woman to 
serve in the Congress, Congresswoman 
Shirley Chisholm stood on this House 
floor to urge passage of the ERA, call-
ing it ‘‘one of the most clear-cut oppor-
tunities we are likely to have to de-
clare our faith in the principles that 
shaped our Constitution.’’ 
But today, in this year that marks 
the centennial of women having the 
right to vote, it is a shameful reality 
that the equal rights amendment still 
has not been enshrined in the Constitu-
tion. As a result, millions of American 
women still face inequality under the 
law and injustice in their careers and 
lives. 
Without full equality under the Con-
stitution, women face a devastating 
wage gap, and this has an impact not 
only on what families earn today but 
on women’s pensions and retirement in 
the future. This is wrong. 
Women face discrimination as they 
raise families. Sixty-two percent of 
pregnant women and new moms are in 
the workforce, but current law allows 
pregnant workers to be placed on un-
paid leave or forced out of their jobs. 
And sexual harassment and assault too 
often go unchecked, all leading to 
women’s underrepresentation at the 
decisionmaking table. 
We know what the statistics are— 
what was it?—33 CEOs of the Fortune 
500 companies are women. Really? 
Today, by passing this resolution, 
the House is paving the way to enshrin-
ing the equal rights amendment in the 
Constitution. It will achieve justice for 
women and achieve progress for fami-
lies and for our children, lowering wage 
disparity and increasing paychecks so 
moms can pay for their family’s needs, 
such as rent, groceries, childcare, and 
healthcare. 
We are able to strengthen America. 
It is not just about women. It is about 
America. 
The ERA will strengthen America, 
unleashing the full power of women in 
our economy and upholding the value 
of equality in our democracy. 
I have four daughters, one son, two 
granddaughters, and I can’t even imag-
ine how anyone could think of his or 
her daughter not having equality; his 
or her sister, mom, wife, not having 
equality. What is that about, that 
women should not have the same sta-
tus of equality as men? 
This has nothing to do with the abor-
tion issue. That is an excuse. That is 
not a reason. It has everything to do 
with a respect for women: your daugh-
ter, your sister, your wife, your moth-
er. And you are saying, by voting 
against this, that your daughter, your 
sister, your mother, your spouse should 
not have equal protection under the 
law in the Constitution of the United 
States. 
To those who say that the ERA is not 
necessary, let me quote from a recent 
statement from the American Associa-
tion of University Women. It states 
that many ‘‘Americans mistakenly be-
lieve that the U.S. Constitution explic-
itly guarantees equality between men 
and women.’’ Perhaps you think that. 
‘‘The equal rights amendment would, 
once and for all, guarantee constitu-
tional 
equality 
between 
men 
and 
women. Its ratification would provide 
the constitutional guarantee that all 
men and women are truly equal under 
the law.’’ 
I urge a strong bipartisan vote for 
this resolution. It will be bipartisan in 
the United States Senate when we send 
it over there shortly, to ensure that 
women are truly equal under the law in 
America. Because we know in America, 
when women succeed, America suc-
ceeds. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, how much time is remaining 
for both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 11 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from New 
York has 15 minutes remaining. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. DEAN). 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman NADLER for bringing this res-
olution to a vote and thank Represent-
ative SPEIER and Representative MALO-
NEY for their work on this legislation. 
This is a historic day. It has been 
nearly a century since the first con-
stitutional amendment to guarantee

equal treatment for women was intro-
duced in 1923. Since then, 37 States 
have ratified the equal rights amend-
ment, including my home State of 
Pennsylvania in 1972. 
Virginia’s ratification of the ERA 
this past January brought us one step 
closer to this basic right that we will 
be held equal in the eyes of the Con-
stitution. The motto of Susan B. An-
thony’s newspaper was: ‘‘Men their 
rights and nothing more; women their 
rights and nothing less.’’ Today, we 
again say women will accept nothing 
less than equality. 
ERA builds on the work of Anthony 
and others like Jeannette Rankin, 
Alice Paul, Ida B. Wells, and this di-
verse Congress. 
I am filled with joy today because I 
am looking forward to going home and 
telling my granddaughters, Aubrey and 
Ella, that we are one step closer to a 
more perfect Union.

Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank Chair-
man NADLER
and JACKIE
SPEIER
for 
their historic leadership on the equal 
rights amendment. 
Madam Speaker, first introduced in 
1923, the equal rights amendment is 
still as relevant and necessary as ever 
because we know that equality for 
women will always elude us when it 
isn’t etched into our Constitution. 
We have seen it when the Supreme 
Court gutted the Violence Against 
Women Act; we have seen it when 
judges don’t enforce equal pay for 
equal work or when a Federal judge 
ruled that Congress didn’t have the au-
thority to outlaw female genital muti-
lation. But if your rights are in the 
Constitution, then they can’t be rolled 
back by the changing whims of legisla-
tors, judges, or Presidents. 
Women are long past due equal treat-
ment under the law, and we will persist 
until it is firmly guaranteed. There is 
no deadline for equality. We demand 
our equality be spelled out in the Con-
stitution, and we spell it E-R-A. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this important vote for equal-
ity. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I reserve 
the balance of my time, Madam Speak-
er. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan 
(Mrs. 
LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.J. Res. 79, which re-
moves the deadline for the ratification 
of the equal rights amendment. A wom-
an’s rights must be guaranteed by our 
government. 
This bill is about the Members of 
Congress ensuring that the rights and 
equality for women are a part of our 
Constitution. 
It is sad to watch those who lose 
their way because they will find any 
way to distract from the issue of equal-
ity. The Members on the other side are 
trying to interject abortion into this, 
but I want to say that even though we 
have come so far as women—there are 
a record number of women lawmakers 
here in this House—we have so far to 
go, and this corrects that injustice and 
recognizes equality for women under 
the law. 
As the great Shirley Chisholm, the 
first African American woman in Con-
gress, stated: ‘‘The time is clearly now 
to put this House on record for the full-
est expression of that equality of op-
portunity which our Founding Fathers 
professed. They professed it, but they 
did not assure it to their daughters, as 
they tried to do for their sons.’’ 
The time is clearly now to put this 
House on record for the fullest expres-
sion of that equality of opportunity 
which our Founding Fathers possessed. 
They possessed it, but they did not as-
sure it. We try as they tried to do for 
their sons. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage support 
of this bill. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Virginia 
(Ms. 
WEXTON). 
Ms. WEXTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank Congresswoman SPEIER for in-
troducing this important resolution. 
In 1923 Alice Paul introduced the 
equal rights amendment to include 
women in our Nation’s founding docu-
ments. Nearly 100 years later, during 
my time in the Virginia State Senate, 
I sponsored the resolution for Virginia 
to ratify the ERA. But it wouldn’t be 
until January 27, 2020, with the historic 
number of women lawmakers serving 
in the State legislature that the great 
Commonwealth of Virginia became the 
38th and final State to ratify the equal 
rights amendment. 
This was not simply a symbolic vote. 
Specifically affirming equality on the 
basis of sex in the Constitution will 
strengthen State and Federal laws that 
protect women. We need the equal 
rights amendment to ensure that equal 
justice under law is a constitutional 
right for women and not just an in-
scription over the entrance to the Su-
preme Court. 
Finally, these words will ring true: 
‘‘Equality of rights under the law shall 
not be denied or abridged by the United 
States or any State on account of sex.’’ 
Today, I am proud to cast my vote in 
support of the ERA and in recognition 
of the tireless work of so many trail-
blazers and activists over the years, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. UNDER-
WOOD). 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.J. 
Res. 79, a bipartisan bill that moves us 
closer to adopting the equal rights 
amendment. 
Madam Speaker, American women 
are barrier breakers. We have broken 
down barriers and shattered glass ceil-
ings in education, at work, in the law, 
in the military, and at home. We are in 
a new era where women are leading in 
ways that they never have before, but 
legal gender discrimination, pay dis-
parities, and inequality remain. They 
will not go away on their own. That is 
why we need to ensure that women’s 
rights are guaranteed by adopting the 
equal rights amendment. 
I was so proud in 2018 when Illinois 
ratified the equal rights amendment at 
long last. Two years later, I am here on 
the House floor because the women of 
northern Illinois sent me here to fight 
for them. I am here to fight for our 
right as women to equal treatment 
under the Constitution of our great 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to move us one giant step clos-
er to legal equality by supporting this 
essential bill. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Oregon 
(Ms. 
BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of this resolution 
to remove the arbitrary deadline to 
ratify the equal rights amendment. 
This year is the centennial of the 19th 
Amendment, yet women are still fight-
ing for full and equal rights under the 
law. 
Women continue to face many bar-
riers to true equality, including preg-
nancy and gender discrimination, un-
equal pay, and a lack of access to a full 
range of reproductive healthcare serv-
ices. The equal rights amendment to 
the Constitution would provide for fun-
damental equality for women regard-
less of who is President, who is on the 
Supreme Court, or changes in Federal 
law. 
Congress first approved the equal 
rights amendment in 1972, and my 
home State of Oregon was quick to rat-
ify it the following year. Now, 38 
States—the 
required 
three-fourths 
under the Constitution—have ratified 
the amendment. Today Congress will 
stand with our States and make it 
clear that it is time—actually way past 
time—to adopt the equal rights amend-
ment. It is not too late to do the right 
thing. It is not too late for equality. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this resolution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1138 
February 13, 2020 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from the State of Virginia 
(Mr. BEYER), who is from the 38th 
State. 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, it has 
been 97 years since the equal rights 
amendment was introduced in the 68th 
Congress and 48 years since the ERA 
passed the House and Senate. 
In those 48 years, I have had three 
daughters 
and 
one 
granddaughter. 
Those four young women are brilliant, 
precocious, and accomplished, with 
strong character, great morality, and 
true nobility. These women are every 
bit the equal of any man I have ever 
met, yet our Constitution does not rec-
ognize their equality nor prohibit dis-
crimination against them. 
I am very proud that the Common-
wealth of Virginia was the 38th State 
to ratify the ERA. We must perma-
nently remove the deadline for State 
ratification and provide an essential 
legal remedy against gender discrimi-
nation. 
Does this sound like a political stunt: 
‘‘Women shall have equal rights in the 
United States and every place subject 
to its jurisdiction. Equality of rights 
under the law shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by 
any State on account of sex.’’ 
No. These words belong in the United 
States Constitution. There is nothing 
partisan about recognizing men and 
women have equal rights under the 
law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I reserve 
the balance of my time, Madam Speak-
er. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
every single constitution in the whole 
world written since 1959, including Af-
ghanistan, for example, has the equiva-
lent of the equal rights amendment, 
but the United States of America does 
not. 
Though my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle and President Trump’s 
Department of Justice may tell you 
otherwise, we need the equal rights 
amendment, and we need it now. 
The requisite number of States have 
now voted to ratify the equal rights 
amendment. Last year my home State 
of Illinois was the 37th State to ratify, 
and this year Virginia brought us to 
that number of 38. 
Today I will proudly vote ‘‘yes’’ to 
show my grandchildren—my grand-
daughters 
and 
my 
grandsons—that 
women are not only strong, powerful, 
and resilient, but also equal citizens 
under the law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with us. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I reserve 
the balance of my time, Madam Speak-
er. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
MATSUI). 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.J. Res. 79 and stand 
shoulder to shoulder with women to de-
mand gender equality and justice. 
When I think about the future of our 
country and what I want it to look like 
for young women and girls like my 
granddaughter, Anna, I envision a just 
and equitable society with fair play, di-
verse leadership, and equal access to 
basic healthcare rights. That is why 
the equal rights amendment is nec-
essary. 
For too long our country’s structural 
barriers have cast a shadow over wom-
en’s rights. With 38 States having af-
firmed their support for the ERA, we 
are one step closer to shattering those 
barriers. 
This resolution negates misguided ar-
guments that because it is an arbitrary 
deadline, the equal rights amendment 
is effectively dead. It is clear from the 
recent actions of Nevada, Illinois, and 
Virginia, and our collective voices, it is 
still very much alive, and we will not 
rest until it is ingrained in the most 
sacred document of our Nation’s his-
tory. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to stand with our country’s 
women and support our right to con-
stitutional equality. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I reserve 
the balance of my time, Madam Speak-
er. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from California (Mrs. 
DAVIS). 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Madam 
Speaker, 244 years ago women were left 
out of our Constitution by the men who 
drafted it. But since then, generations 
of women and men have blazed a steady 
trail towards equality in this country; 
but we still do not have constitutional 
equality. 
I attended many ERA events rep-
resenting the League of Women Voters 
in the 1970s, and if someone would have 
told me then that we would still be 
fighting for this in 2020, I would have 
said that it was a failure of justice. 
Why is anyone against rights for ev-
eryone? 
Madam Speaker, equal rights for 
women transcend your politics, they 
transcend your age, where you are 
from, and your gender. 
Women in this country continue to 
receive unequal pay, suffer from har-
assment in the workplace, endure dis-
crimination for pregnancies, and fight 
long legal battles over domestic vio-
lence cases. A correction of our Con-
stitution is clearly long overdue. 
Liberty and justice for all must apply 
equally to women and men in this 
country. Let’s pass this resolution. 
Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I reserve 
the balance of my time, Madam Speak-
er. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker. I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ). 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
28 days ago on Martin Luther King, 
Jr.’s birthday, Virginia became the 
38th State to ratify the ERA. After dec-
ades of struggle, 48 years after congres-
sional passage, two-thirds of the States 
agreed to an amendment that secures 
equal rights for all American citizens 
regardless of sex. This amendment 
would touch every corner of our lives. 
With 24 words our Nation will finally 
fully recognize women as equal partici-
pants in society. 
To my colleagues opposing the ERA: 
What are you afraid of? 
How can you oppose this resolution 
and then look women in your district, 
in your churches, and in your own 
homes in the eye? 
Today is your chance to stand on the 
right side of her story. I implore my 
colleagues, vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.J. Res. 79. 
Let us finish this struggle and at long 
last have women and men finally equal 
under the law with their rights en-
shrined in the U.S. Constitution. 
b 1030 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Madam 
Speaker, since women gained the right 
to vote 100 years ago, we have made in-
credible progress—rolling back laws 
like those that kept us from serving on 
juries, owning land, or even getting our 
own credit card—and this Congress has 
more women than ever. 
But true equality is still a goal, not 
a reality. The fact is women are still 
paid less than men for the same work, 
and we still have men passing laws 
that dictate our choices about our bod-
ies. 
It is clear, if we want equality, we 
need the ERA, and the people agree. We 
saw that at women’s marches across 
the country and in the groundswell of 
the #MeToo movement. 
That energy is leading to change. 
The people are speaking. It is up to us 
to listen. Arbitrary deadlines are no 
reason to silence our voices. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and give women 
the same rights as men. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port today of Congresswoman SPEIER’s 
bill, H.J. Res. 79. I thank Congress-
woman SPEIER
and Congresswoman 
MALONEY for their consistent leader-
ship as warrior women. 
The ERA would guarantee rights to 
all and would finally affirm women’s 
equality in our Constitution by remov-
ing this arbitrary deadline. 
We know that, too often, women have 
been relegated to the sidelines and left

out of the Constitution, especially 
Black women and women of color. For 
example, there is still rampant gender 
wage discrimination. 
Discrimination against women must 
end. That is why the ERA is so impor-
tant. It would make sure that our gov-
ernment would ensure that women are 
treated equally, a right that needs to 
be clearly outlined in every aspect of 
our country. 
I want my granddaughters, Jordan, 
Simone, and Giselle, to know that they 
are equal to men, that their rights are 
enshrined in the Constitution. They, 
like every girl and woman, deserve 
equality in their country. They should 
know that their country, the United 
States of America, has finally joined 
the rest of the world to stand up for 
their rights as American women. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Hawaii (Mr. CASE). 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
very strong support of this resolution 
to advance the cause of full and equal 
rights for all women. I do so for my 1- 
year-old granddaughter for whom I 
deeply hope that, when she reaches the 
age of understanding, the ERA will be 
as enshrined in our Constitution as is 
the right to vote today. I also do so as 
a proud citizen of my Hawaii. 
On March 22, 1972, when the U.S. Sen-
ate sent the ERA to the States, it was 
early in the morning in Hawaii; but by 
shortly after noon that same day, our 
legislature voted for ratification, the 
first State to do so. 
For my country and Hawaii and for 
all of our women leaders who led this 
fight, past and present, I proudly join 
my colleagues in voting for the ERA. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, after nearly a cen-
tury, the equal rights amendment is on 
the cusp of ratification. 
At America’s founding, women were 
intentionally left out of the Constitu-
tion. 
As 
second-class 
citizens, 
we 
lacked the right to vote, hold most 
jobs, or even own property. Today, we 
still receive less pay for the same 
work, and we face violence and harass-
ment just for being women. But the 
ERA will prohibit all of that. In the 
eyes of our most sacred document, we 
will finally be equal. 
Women’s rights should not depend on 
congressional whims or who occupies 
the White House. These basic funda-
mental rights must be guaranteed. 
But, if we want to hand a more per-
fect union to our daughters—and I have 
two of them—we must seize this mo-
ment to end sex discrimination. We 
owe it to the women who sacrificed be-
fore us and all of our daughters and 
sons who deserve a life of true equality. 
So I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this resolution to remove the 
arbitrary and outdated deadline for 
ratifying the ERA. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time I have remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BLUNT
ROCHESTER). 
The 
gentleman 
from New York has 1 minute remain-
ing. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin 
for a parliamentary inquiry. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is my intention to raise a 
point of order that this resolution re-
quires a two-thirds vote. I will argue 
the point of order when it is made, but 
I need to know when the proper time is 
to raise the point of order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
proper time would be when the Chair 
puts the question on passage. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, do I put the question before 
or after it is passed? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. At the 
time the Chair puts the question on 
passage. 
Mr. COLLINS. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it has been inter-
esting, the discussion on the floor 
today. It has been interesting on both 
sides to hear the different aspects of 
why this bill is on the floor, why we are 
doing it, why we shouldn’t be doing it, 
and many things. It has been inter-
esting, the discussion, if you go from a 
strictly number-of-States category. 
What has been interesting is my col-
leagues across the aisle have talked 
about that there are now 38 States, but 
they fail to mention 5 States that re-
scinded their votes. Five States would 
put you under 38. 
What was interesting to me in the 
Rules Committee the other night, the 
argument was that, if they rescind it, 
it is not valid to rescind, yet you can 
add States after the time limit is up. 
That is an interesting argument to 
make if you are actually looking at it 
from the perspective of if they rescind 
it within the timeframe yet passed it 
after the timeframe, that that is okay. 
Then I heard one of my colleagues ac-
tually mentioned the fact that, if we 
passed it in here today, that this would 
now become part of the process, along 
with the State of Virginia ratifying it, 
it is now part of our Constitution. 
I am sure this was just a euphoric 
discussion about how this would actu-
ally go about, but they were also for-
getting the Senate is involved in this. 
It is amazing. 
I was really worried at one point in 
the discussion that it was said on mul-
tiple occasions that there was no pro-
tection in the Constitution for women. 
I was almost scared for a moment that 
the 14th Amendment had been repealed 
and I didn’t know it. 
It is in there and still is in there. I 
checked just a few minutes ago. It is 
safe. 
It is interesting to determine, when 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, one of the fore-
most architects in looking at this bill 
even in the 1970s, coming forward, has 
said: If you want to do this, start over. 
Do it the proper way. 
As my chairman has said earlier, ba-
sically, a deadline should not get in the 
way of what we want. A deadline 
should not get in the way of what I 
want to have happen. That is becoming 
more and more of a concern in this 
body, that the rules and parliamentary 
procedures don’t matter if it interferes 
with what we want. 
But, at the end of the day, the ques-
tion really becomes: Why are we doing 
this? Why are we bringing this forth 
when there is absolutely no legal prece-
dent, no constitutional precedent, no 
anything out there—including some of 
the founders who actually started this 
whole process 40-plus years ago, who 
said this is not the way you do it. 
The reason I know that that is a con-
cern is because some of those who have 
actually said this have been criticized 
in the media from the perspective of 
supporters of the ERA to say Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg’s comments have now 
killed the ERA, or effectively done it. 
The reason is because she is speaking 
the truth about this issue. 
We disagree on most everything from 
a legal perspective, but on this one, we 
happen to agree, and she has laid forth 
clearly what should happen here. 
But let me also say—and it has been 
talked about a great deal, so I think we 
just need to come to the real scenario 
why this is happening. It is not that we 
believe it will actually happen. For 
anybody here who believes that today 
is actually going to put it in part of 
the Constitution, that is not going to 
happen. 
So what is it? It is a political nod to 
the understanding of those who are 
speaking for this. 
As we have heard earlier, NARAL 
Pro-Choice America: 
With its ratification, the ERA would rein-
force the constitutional right to abortion by 
clarifying that the sexes have equal rights, 
which would require judges to strike down 
anti-abortion laws. 
Also, NARAL: 
The ERA will support protecting women’s 
right to abortion. With five anti-choice Jus-
tices on the Supreme Court and Roe v. Wade 
on the chopping block, it is more important 
than ever we codify women’s bodily auton-
omy in our lives. 
Codirector of Reproaction: 
Abortion restrictions amount to sex dis-
crimination because they single out people 
for unfair treatment on the basis of sex. 
The senior counsel of National Wom-
en’s Law Center: 
The ERA would help create a basis for 
challenging abortion restrictions. 
This is what this is actually about. 
This is what the basis has needed be-
cause there has been a shifting in this

country to understand that, in our 
opinion—in the opinion of many—abor-
tion is simply murder in the womb. It 
is not about life. 
It is interesting, we are talking 
about the rights of women today— 
which, again, this bill doesn’t have 
anything to do with—but we are not 
concerned if the young women in the 
womb are even able to have a birthday. 
That is not a concern. 
So what would happen from these 
folks who are supporting your resolu-
tion today? Why do they want it? Be-
cause it gives a claim, from start to 
finish, unfettered abortion. 
So what does that mean? That means 
let’s bring back partial-birth abortion, 
which, if I have to remind anybody 
here, means the delivery of the child 
all the way until the moment the chin 
comes almost out, and then actually 
crushing their skull. That is what that 
is. 
If that is a right we are protecting, I 
don’t want any part of it, and neither 
do most Americans. They don’t want a 
part of it. But that is one of those re-
strictions that will be laid back. 
It would also continue to allow un-
limited abortions in any State for any 
reason, including sex selection. 
It is interesting that we would talk 
about this today, the ERA, and use 
this, yet a family could choose to abort 
a child because it is a male or a female. 
Let’s be honest about this. 
But the bottom line for me, what 
really bothers me the most about when 
it is unlimited, unfettered access to 
abortion that this bill opens up, if it 
were to have passed, is one that hits 
close to home for me. 
You see, a European country recently 
stated that a geneticist in Iceland said: 
We have almost basically eradicated 
Down syndrome people. 
I thought to myself, for a second: 
That would be great. I mean, if we 
could actually remove Down syndrome 
and help those and cure that, that 
would be an amazing medical discovery 
for all people. Except there is one por-
tion. 
Do you know how they have done it? 
Through genetic testing and killing the 
children in the womb. They don’t even 
let them have a birthday. 
One 
Icelandic 
counselor 
counsels 
mothers as follows: 
This is your life. You have the right 
to choose how your life will look. She 
said: We don’t look at abortion as mur-
der. We look at it as a thing that we 
ended. 
Do you want to know why this has 
opened up, America? This is why. 
And for those of us like myself who 
have a disabled child, I do not want to 
hear that we are protecting disabled 
rights and other rights when we are not 
even allowing them to be born in cer-
tain arenas. 
Every day, I get a text on this phone. 
It is from my daughter. Jordan is 27 
years old. She has spina bifida. She 
cannot walk and has never taken a 
step, and I believe it probably, given 
the medical condition, will not happen 
this side of Heaven. But she rolls and 
she smiles. She goes to work 3 days a 
week. She gets herself up early to put 
her clothes on and take her shower and 
get a bus that she calls, and she goes to 
work. 
The folks in Sweden, do you know 
what they want to do? Kill her. Be-
cause she is not as valuable, as a Down 
syndrome child is not as valuable. 
Do you want to open this Pandora’s 
box of no abortion restrictions? Then 
own what you are doing. 
But when Jordan texts me, she texts 
me: Good morning, Daddy. I love you. 
How was your day? 
Madam Speaker, when we found out 
27 years ago—a week ago, 27 years 
ago—that Jordan was going to have 
spina bifida, we were a young couple 
just happy that God gave us a child, 
and to find out that she had a dis-
ability only kept our hearts more in 
tune to what God had given. 
My wife went to school the next 
week, and she was telling the teacher 
about what was going on. She said: We 
are trying to figure out where we need 
to go to have Jordan, help when she is 
born and get some more medical atten-
tion. 
This person looked at her and said: 
You know you have choices, correct?’’ 
And my wife said: Well, yes. There is 
Northside Hospital and others. 
She said: No. Oh, no, dear. You don’t 
have to go through with this. That is 
your choice. 
b 1045 
In other words, as my wife looked at 
her and said: ‘‘You’re talking about my 
baby.’’ 
You see, when we go down this path, 
don’t flower this bill up. Look at the 
ones who actually talk about it and 
say this is an open door to abortion on 
demand, with no restrictions, no gov-
ernment interference—in fact, govern-
ment pays for it. 
But before you do that, America, as 
we look around, I want you to think of 
the picture on the new Gerber baby ad 
of the young person with Down syn-
drome, who is now the face of Gerber 
baby food. If he was in Iceland, he 
would have been one of those that, as it 
said: Oh, we ended. 
Think about my daughter, who, when 
we allow it out there for people who 
are struggling—and to get news that 
you have a child with a disability, that 
is one of the most amazingly dev-
astating things that you can hear be-
cause you don’t know what the future 
holds. 
But what you do know is life is a gift 
from God, and that it is my joy to take 
care of her. We had 30 major surgeries 
before she was 5 years old, three of 
which were 9 hours in length. Tell me 
her life doesn’t matter. 
For someone who doesn’t have the 
possibility of understanding, and they 
are given a choice because they have a 
disability, and somebody tells them 
and gets to them and says: Don’t 
worry. Disabilities are bad. Just go 
ahead and end that life, and go on with 
your life. 
This is what this opens up. 
So don’t give me a bill that is going 
nowhere for the reasons that have been 
given. The true reasons are found in 
your own supporters. The true reasons 
are found in what we know to be true. 
When you understand what this is 
about, then I will stand till I have no 
more breath in my body for the rights 
of those who can’t speak for them-
selves. 
It is amazing to me that it was said: 
What would I be saying to my daughter 
if I voted against this? 
I would be saying to Jordan, as I will: 
Jordan, the 14th Amendment is still 
there. Protections in law are still 
there. And by the way, restrictions on 
abortion will not be done away with, 
and your life matters. 
So if you want a picture of this, pic-
ture Jordan. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Once again, if Congress can enact a 
resolution putting a time limit, it can 
enact a resolution removing a time 
limit. And when the Senate passes this 
resolution, the ERA will be part of the 
Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
very proudly, the first Muslim woman 
ever elected in the Congress, in support 
of H.J. Res. 79. 
Madam Speaker, what is even more 
interesting is what I have been hearing 
about this obsession to control and op-
press women in the United States of 
America. I cannot believe it is 2020, and 
we are still debating the merits of the 
equal rights amendment. It is beyond 
time. 
I want you all to know this is about 
women of color, women with disabil-
ities, transgender women, immigrant 
women. These women are affected by 
issues like unequal pay, sexual vio-
lence, lack of access for healthcare, 
and poverty. 
So much of what we are doing here, 
in trying to promote women’s equality, 
is about gender, racial, and economic 
justice. 
Madam Speaker, know this: A ‘‘no’’ 
vote today is condoning oppression of 
women in the United States of Amer-
ica. I urge support. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of equality and the principle 
that our Constitution was designed, not to 
shore up the dominance of the historically 
powerful, but to ensure the rights of all and to 
foster a society in which each of us is free to 
shape our future based on our abilities. The 
resolution today removes the deadline Con-
gress put in place for the ratification of the 
Equal Rights Amendment. While ratification of

the Equal Rights Amendment is imperative to 
enshrine equal rights for women, I do not be-
lieve it is necessary to strike the deadline for 
ratification. By voting on this legislation we 
may imply that it is necessary for Congress to 
lift a self-imposed deadline. I do not prescribe 
to this view. 
Congressional authority to propose Amend-
ments to the Constitution and the mode of rati-
fication is absolute. The language of Article V 
of the Constitution represents the Founders in-
tent to create a stable government designed 
for change. Article V requires two-thirds of the 
House and Senate to propose an amendment. 
Congress can choose ratification through 
three-fourths of the state legislatures or state 
ratifying conventions. Once the amendment is 
proposed to the states, there is no Constitu-
tionally imposed time limit on the ratification 
process. Article V of the Constitution is silent 
with regard to when a state must consider and 
ratify an amendment. For example, the ratifi-
cation process for the 27th Amendment took 
more than two hundred years. 
Historically, Congress has ratified amend-
ments without specific time limitations. The 
first amendment to contain a time limit was the 
18th Amendment which established the prohi-
bition of alcohol. The text of the 18th, 20th, 
21st, and 22nd Amendments each contained 
language limiting the time frame for ratifica-
tion. In contrast, the text of the Equal Rights 
Amendment ratified by the states does not 
contain a time limit. It is the proposing clause 
sent to the states for ratification of the Equal 
Rights Amendment which contains a seven- 
year time limitation. The language of a pro-
posing clause is not binding. The current ratifi-
cation process of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment is properly before the states and is rea-
sonable and sufficiently contemporaneous. 
Having been ratified by Virginia, according 
to Article V, the ERA has become part of the 
Constitution. Furthermore, if the deadline is 
binding, then passage of this resolution, with-
out passage in the Senate, does not cure the 
defect. Because the deadline is not binding, 
this resolution is not necessary, but also not 
harmful. 
Women continue to face additional hurdles 
in the pathways to success. On average, 
women still earn less than men for the same 
job functions. Pregnant women often lack 
basic protections and reasonable accommoda-
tion in the workplace. Perhaps most con-
cerning of all, violence against women is still 
widespread and undermines the educational 
and social potential of women and young chil-
dren in this country. 
I am proud to have worked with my Demo-
cratic colleagues in the House to pass legisla-
tion to remedy these inequalities. The House 
recently passed the Protect the Right to Orga-
nize Act (H.R. 2474) which protects workers 
who are trying to form a union. In most of 
America, women earn less than men, but 
women and men working under a union con-
tract receive equal pay for equal work. We 
have worked to fill the gaps in the patchwork 
of existing laws governing how and when 
workers take time off to care for themselves 
and their families. Expanding the Family and 
Medical Leave Act to cover more working par-
ents and low wage workers who are currently 
excluded from leave policies is a top priority. 
Nearly two thirds of minimum wage workers 
in the United States are women. The House 
has successfully passed the Raise the Wage 
Act (H.R. 582). This will raise the income lev-
els of the most economically insecure house-
holds and is a step in the right direction to-
wards pay equity. The Pregnant Worker’s Fair-
ness Act (H.R. 2694) is an important piece of 
legislation that will provide reasonable accom-
modations to pregnant women in the work-
force. The House also passed the Violence 
Against Women Reauthorization Act (H.R. 
1585) which expanded protections and pro-
vides critical funding for victim services, law 
enforcement training, and data collection. 
However, even if all this legislation were to 
become law, it would not be the same as 
amending 
the 
Constitution 
to 
guarantee 
women equal rights. 
Discrimination in the workplace, violence in 
the home, and institutional barriers require 
systemic legal and cultural change. Ratifica-
tion of the Equal Rights Amendment provides 
an additional legal tool for combatting discrimi-
nation on the basis of sex. 
We will continue the fight for equality and 
work towards a more inclusive and equitable 
society. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
over the course of many years, I have consist-
ently sponsored and promoted women’s rights 
legislation to ensure equal pay for equal work 
including most recently, the Paycheck Fair-
ness Act. 
In the struggle against wage discrimination, 
I voted in favor of 2009 the Lilly Ledbetter Fair 
Pay Act. 
To help ensure that women are not dis-
advantaged in their careers because of time 
taken to attend to their families, I was an early 
and strong advocate of multiple legislative ini-
tiatives to provide family medical leave—in-
cluding the groundbreaking bill that became 
law, the Family and Medical Leave Act. 
And this year, I have cosponsored the FAM-
ILY Act. 
I voted to ensure that women’s rights are 
protected in higher education by strongly sup-
porting Title IX. 
I have supported legislation to amend pen-
sion and tax policies that negatively impact 
women and I supported numerous bills to es-
tablish certain rights for sexual assault sur-
vivors including the Survivors’ Bill of Rights 
which is now law. 
Since the mid-1990s, I have led the effort to 
end the barbaric practice of human trafficking, 
a human rights abuse that is a perverted and 
unimaginable exploitation of women and girls 
that thrives on greed, disrespect and secrecy. 
Twenty years ago, the U.S. Congress ap-
proved and the President signed legislation 
that I authored—the Trafficking Victims Protec-
tion Act of 2000—a comprehensive whole-of- 
government initiative to combat sex and labor 
trafficking in the United States and around the 
world. 
The Violence Against Women Act (See Divi-
sion B) was reauthorized and significantly ex-
panded by my law. Last year, I cosponsored 
the Violence Against Women Extension Act of 
2019. 
This past January, I authored another bill 
that was signed into law—my fifth major law 
on human trafficking—The Frederick Douglass 
Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection 
Act. 
After a young college student from my dis-
trict, Samantha Josephson, was brutally mur-
dered by the driver of what she thought was 
her Uber ride, I introduced Sami’s Law to 
make the ride share safer for all. In recent 
months it has been shocking to learn that 
thousands of women who use Lyft or Uber 
have been sexually assaulted and some have 
been murdered. 
I arrive at the debate on the elimination of 
the deadline for the ERA from the perspective 
of my work to ensure equality and protection 
for women and every woman’s right to be 
treated fairly and without exploitation. 
The words of Supreme Court Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg on the legal impermissibility of 
extending the deadline for ratification have 
sealed the fate of the proposed amendment. 
Justice Ginsburg’s judgment is that the dead-
line has expired and that she ‘‘would like it to 
start over’’ presents a definitive view that the 
process has come to an end. 
According to Vox, Justice Ginsburg also 
said ‘‘There’s too much controversy about 
latecomers, plus, a number of states have 
withdrawn their ratification. So, if you count a 
latecomer on the plus side, how can you dis-
regard states that said ‘we’ve changed our 
minds?’ ’’ Five states—Idaho, Kentucky, Ne-
braska, Tennessee, and South Dakota—voted 
to ratify the ERA but later rescinded that ratifi-
cation. 
Today, however, one thing is absolutely 
clear from both sides of the abortion divide: 
ratification of the ERA with its current wording 
will likely overturn laws prohibiting public fund-
ing of abortion—like the Hyde Amendment— 
and undo modest restrictions on abortion in-
cluding waiting periods, parental involvement, 
women’s right to know laws, conscience rights 
including the Weldon Amendment and any 
ban on late term abortion including the Pain- 
Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. 
Should the ERA be ratified without clarifying 
abortion-neutral language—to wit: ‘‘Nothing in 
this Article shall be construed to grant or se-
cure any right relating to abortion or the fund-
ing thereof’’—abortion activists will use the 
ERA as they have successfully used state 
ERAs in both New Mexico and Connecticut— 
to force taxpayers to pay for abortion on de-
mand. 
Consider this: 
The Supreme Court of New Mexico ruled in 
1998 that the state was required to fund abor-
tion based solely on the state ERA and said 
the law ‘‘undoubtedly singles out . . . a gen-
der-linked condition that is unique to women’’ 
and therefore ‘‘violates the Equal Rights 
Amendment.’’ 
In like manner, the Supreme Court of Con-
necticut invalidated its state ban on abortion 
funding and wrote in 1986: ‘‘it is therefore 
clear, under the Connecticut ERA, that the 
regulation excepting . . . abortions from the 
Medicaid 
program 
discriminates 
against 
women.’’ 
Today in Pennsylvania, activists are suing to 
eviscerate the abortion funding restriction in 
that state claiming that the Hyde-type restric-
tion violates the Pennsylvania Equal Rights 
Amendment. 
While I take issue with abortion activists 
who refuse to recognize an unborn child’s in-
herent dignity, worth and value, at least activ-
ists on both sides agree that the ERA as writ-
ten will be used in court as a means to com-
pel public funding of abortion and to strike 
down the Hyde Amendment and other modest 
abortion restrictions at both the state and fed-
eral level.

February 13, 2020 
NARAL Pro-Choice America plainly states: 
‘‘With its ratification, the ERA . . . would re-
quire judges to strike down anti-abortion laws 
. . .’’ 
A senior lawyer of the National Women’s 
Law Centers said: ‘‘The ERA would help cre-
ate a basis to challenge abortion restrictions.’’ 
The National Right to Life Committee states 
that ‘‘the proposed federal ERA would invali-
date the federal Hyde Amendment and all 
state restrictions on tax-funded abortions.’’ 
And the U.S. Conference of Catholic 
Bishops agree and wrote ‘‘One consequence 
of the ERA would be the likely requirement of 
federal funding for abortions . . . (and) argu-
ments have been proffered that the federal 
ERA would . . . restrain the ability of the fed-
eral and state governments to enact other 
measures regulating abortion, such as third-tri-
mester or partial birth abortion bans, parental 
consent, informed consent, conscience-related 
exemptions, and other provisions.’’ 
According to the most recent Marist Poll 
(January 2020), 60 percent of all Americans 
oppose using tax dollars for abortion, seven in 
ten Americans including nearly half who iden-
tify as pro-choice want significant restrictions 
on abortion, a majority of Americans—55 per-
cent—want to ban abortion after 20 weeks, 
and nearly two-thirds of Americans oppose 
abortion if the child will be born with Down 
Syndrome. 
I believe that all human beings—especially 
the weakest and most vulnerable including un-
born baby girls and boys—deserve respect, 
empathy, compassion and protection from vio-
lence. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 79, which 
will remove a deadline for the ratification of 
the Equal Rights Amendment. This will ensure 
that our country fully accepts the impact of the 
recent ratifications by the states of Nevada, Il-
linois, and Virginia. 
The Equal Rights Amendment represents 
the further advancement of women in our soci-
ety. It enshrines the American ideal that 
‘‘equality of rights under the law shall not be 
denied or abridged by the United States or 
any State on account of sex’’. While other ex-
isting statutes have been interpreted as pro-
hibiting some forms of sex discrimination, 
there are still numerous avenues in which they 
are inefficient for the full protection of women 
under the law. 
As representatives of communities across 
our nation, we must set an explicit example of 
our championing of women’s rights. Women 
continue to face obstacles to their full equality, 
including through unequal pay, pregnancy dis-
crimination, sexual and domestic violence, and 
inadequate access to health care services. As 
the United States, we must be mindful of the 
global influence we have, and we must ensure 
that gender equality is, without a doubt, en-
shrined in our foundational principles. 
The bipartisan support of this legislation 
captures the will of Americans for the ratifica-
tion of the Equal Rights Amendment. There-
fore, I am proud to support this resolution as 
a crucial step forward for gender equality. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 844, 
the previous question is ordered. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the joint resolu-
tion. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be engrossed and read a third time, and 
was read the third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the passage of the joint 
resolution. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I have a point of order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his point of order. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I make the point of order that 
a two-thirds vote is required for pas-
sage of this joint resolution because it 
does have the effect of amending the 
Constitution. 
And on the point of order, Madam 
Speaker, there was an extension that 
was passed in 1978, where this issue 
came up, which extended the deadline 
until 1982. 
In 1982, the Equal Rights Amendment 
deadlines expired. In 1983, Chairman 
Peter Rodino, of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, decided to introduce H.J. Res. 
1, which started the process over again. 
The difference between what hap-
pened in 1978 and 1983 is that Chairman 
Rodino, and those who supported re-in-
troducing and attempting to pass the 
Equal 
Rights 
Amendment, 
realized 
that it had expired and required a 
start-over. 
I believe that this does fall under 
that, and that it does require a start- 
over, and I would ask the Chair to rule 
on whether or not the point of order is 
well-taken and this does require a two- 
thirds vote. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair is prepared to rule. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 842, an 
affirmative vote of a majority of Mem-
bers present and voting, a quorum 
being present, is required on final pas-
sage of the pending measure. The gen-
tleman’s point of order is overruled. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I appeal the decision of the 
Chair. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
terms of House Resolution 842 are un-
ambiguous and so, consistent with the 
ruling of the Chair on September 16, 
1977, to permit an appeal in this case 
would be tantamount to permitting a 
direct change in that resolution. As 
such, the Chair has not issued an ap-
pealable ruling, and the Chair will put 
the question on passage of the joint 
resolution. 
Mr. 
SENSENBRENNER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I appeal that ruling of the 
Chair as well, which I believe is appeal-

cation of the equal rights amendment (Rep. 
Speier—Judiciary).

quest of the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan? 
There was no objection. 
f 
HONORING MISS DAISY ELLIOTT 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, 
today, I stand here proud to say that I 
was one who cast my vote for the pas-
sage of ERA in America. 
I also rise today to recognize a 
woman who was so very instrumental 
to the State of Michigan and its fight 
for civil rights, Miss Daisy Elliott. 
Miss Elliott was only 1 of 11 women 
elected to the Michigan Constitutional 
Convention in 1961. She was key in en-
suring that our State’s constitution es-
tablished the Michigan Civil Rights 
Commission, with the authority to in-
vestigate charges of discrimination 
based on race, religion, color, or na-
tional origin. 
Daisy served in the Michigan Legisla-
ture for nearly 20 years as an effective 
and influential voice of equality and 
introduced more than 80 bills that were 
enacted, including the Elliott-Larsen 
Civil Rights Act. Daisy Elliott was a 
fierce advocate for workers, senior citi-
zens, and people of color. 
Today, in honor of Black History 
Month, I salute and honor Miss Daisy 
Elliott. Madam Speaker, I honor her 
legacy.

OBSERVING 
NATIONAL 
CHIL-
DREN’S DENTAL HEALTH MONTH 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, 
February is National Children’s Dental 
Health Month. This month is a time 
when healthcare professionals, pro-
viders, and educators help promote 
good oral health practices to children, 
families, and many others. 
Tooth decay is still the number one 
chronic infectious disease among chil-
dren in the United States. 
Throughout my career as a dentist, I 
can attest to the benefits of proper oral 
health and how important it is to focus 
on children from a very young age. 
Preventive measures like brushing, 
flossing, and rinsing correctly are im-
portant life lessons that should be 
learned from a young age. 
I would also like to recognize the 
American Dental Association for their 
strenuous work in this area. They have 
implemented the Give Kids A Smile 
program. It provides hundreds of thou-
sands of underserved kids with free 
oral health education, screenings, and 
preventive and/or restorative services 
throughout the entire year. 
It is a very much needed program, 
and I am personally very proud of the 
American Dental Association for the 
work that they do in this area. 
f 
SUPPORT MEDICAID EXPANSION, 
NOT BLOCK GRANTS 
(Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. KENDRA S. HORN of Oklahoma. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak on the 
issue of healthcare in Oklahoma. I hear 
from far too many Oklahomans who 
can’t afford the healthcare they need. 
Today, Oklahoma has the second 
highest rate of uninsured people in the 
Nation. Our State ranks 48th for unin-
sured children. We cannot continue to 
let Oklahomans fall through the cracks 
of our healthcare system. 
The answer to solving our State’s 
healthcare crisis is straightforward. We 
must expand Medicaid. By not expand-
ing Medicaid, Oklahoma has lost up to 
$1 billion per year. Seven hospitals 
across our State have closed, in part 
because 
we 
did 
not 
accept 
the 
healthcare support our State is enti-
tled to. 
Expanding Medicaid in Oklahoma 
would extend health insurance to up to 
200,000 Oklahomans who don’t cur-
rently have insurance. It is the right 
choice for our State. Instead, the ad-
ministration and our Governor are pro-
posing an alternative plan to turn 
SoonerCare into a block grant pro-
gram. 
The plan to block grant Medicaid 
would encourage cuts to healthcare 
services, restrict access to healthcare 
providers and lifesaving medications, 
and contribute to hospital closures. 
Too often, block grants have often been 
misused for political pet projects and 
to fill holes in the budget. 
While we are still learning the spe-
cifics of the block grant plan, here is 
what we do know: more than 500,000 
children rely on SoonerCare, and their 
insurance would be threatened by the 
plan to cap and slash Medicaid. Enough 
is enough. 
f 
CONGRATULATING DALLAS HIGH 
SCHOOL MOUNTAINEERS 
(Mr. MEUSER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the Dallas High 
School Mountaineers football team for 
their outstanding championship sea-
son. 
Dallas football went undefeated dur-
ing their regular season, going 15–0 
with playoff wins and a district cham-
pionship.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1144 
February 13, 2020 
For the first time since 1993, the Dal-
las Mountaineers made it all the way 
to a Pennsylvania State championship. 
Back in 2016, Dallas football went 2– 
9, with 12 freshmen on the team. Three 
years later, these players led their 
team to a championship season. 
Under the leadership of the one and 
only coach Richie Mannello and his 
great assistant coaches, Dallas was 
strong on all sides of the ball, with a 
great gang-tackling defense, a super- 
solid offensive line, an electrifying 
passing game, and a backfield I will 
never forget. 
The Dallas Mountaineer parents, stu-
dent body, band, and cheerleaders were 
a huge part of the Friday night vic-
tories, and they made the games an 
awful lot of fun. The entire commu-
nity, restaurants, fire department, all 
the residents of the Back Mountain 
were all part of this great season. 
We are going to miss these boys 
wearing Dallas blue under the Friday 
night lights, but we know the Dallas 
tradition, long established, will live on.

RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE BLUE DOG COALI-
TION 
(Mrs. MURPHY of Florida asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
25th anniversary of the Blue Dog Coali-
tion, a caucus of pragmatic Democrats 
I have the honor to help lead this Con-
gress. 
Since February 1995, the Blue Dog 
Coalition has been working to bridge 
partisan divide and deliver bipartisan 
results. While the makeup and size of 
our coalition has changed over the 
years, our focus on fiscal responsibility 
and a strong national security has 
never wavered. 
Blue Dogs recognize that our con-
stituents expect us to be good stewards 
of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars 
and that a skyrocketing national debt 
is a threat to our national security. 
Over the last 25 years, Blue Dogs 
have helped deliver balanced budgets, 
end government shutdowns, grow the 
middle class, and pass commonsense 
laws, such as pay-as-you-go. 
This Congress we are leading the 
fight on election security, infrastruc-
ture, and job creation, and we are push-
ing Congress to be better by ending 
partisan gerrymandering and proposing 
No Budget, No Pay. 
Most importantly, Blue Dogs remain 
focused on our founding principles of 
fiscal responsibility and a strong na-
tional security. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in 
recognizing the Blue Dog Coalition’s 
25th anniversary this month. 
CELEBRATING MARY MCLEOD 
BETHUNE 
(Mr. WALTZ asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALTZ. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to celebrate one of the most 
prominent African American women in 
my community and our Nation’s his-
tory, Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. 
At an early age, Dr. Bethune took an 
interest in the power of learning and 
promoting civil rights. In 1904, Dr. Be-
thune opened the Daytona Literary 
and Industrial Training School for 
Negro Girls in Daytona Beach, which 
later merged with the Cookman Insti-
tute for Men in Jacksonville to form 
Bethune-Cookman College, now Uni-
versity, where she served as president. 
As Dr. Bethune worked to build the 
school she founded, she also became a 
national leader on issues related to 
civil rights, women, and young people, 
even providing counsel to U.S. Presi-
dents. 
In 2018, the Florida legislature passed 
and the governor signed legislation to 
place a statue in her honor rep-
resenting Florida in the National Stat-
uary Hall collection here in the Cap-
itol. 
Dr. Bethune knew education is the 
key to a quality life and a better life, 
and it is my honor to recognize her 
contributions on the floor here today.

DRAWING 
ATTENTION 
TO 
THE 
TRAGEDY UNFOLDING IN IDLIB, 
SYRIA 
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, as 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, I rise to draw attention to 
the tragedy unfolding in Idlib, Syria. 
The regime backed by Iran and Rus-
sia continues to target civilians. They 
target hospitals and other civilian in-
frastructure. Just drop bombs. They 
are 
levelling 
whole 
neighborhoods, 
which is indicative that the regime 
does not want people to return to their 
homes. They are killing innocent men, 
women, and children for no reason. 
Over half a million people have been 
displaced in the last 2 months. There 
must be a humanitarian response from 
the world, and it must start here in the 
United States. There must be account-
ability, and we must show the Syrian 
people that we have not forgotten 
them. How can we stand idly by and 
allow this to continue to happen? 
I call on the President and all Mem-
bers of both houses to have a forceful 
response to the regime in Syria to say 
that we will not tolerate the targeting 
of civilians, the wholesale killing of 
children and women and all civilians. 
We need to stand on the side of justice, 
and we must show the Syrian people 
that we have not forgotten them. 
CELEBRATING OREGON’S 161ST 
BIRTHDAY 
(Mr. WALDEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WALDEN. Madam Speaker, on 
February 14, Oregon celebrates her 
161st birthday. As a lifelong Oregonian 
whose ancestors came there by wagon 
train in 1845, I may be a little biased, 
but I can confidently say there is no 
place like Oregon. 
She boasts of so many unparalleled 
wonders and sights from the mighty, 
powerful Columbia River and the winds 
of the Columbia River Gorge to the ma-
jestic Painted Hills to the rugged land-
scape of the Umatilla National Forest, 
the clear, deep blue waters of Crater 
Lake, the deepest lake in North Amer-
ica. Then think about the great Cas-
cade Mountains or Steens Mountain or 
the Wallowas or the Blues, and then all 
the way down to the depths of Hells 
Canyon. 
The late great Republican Governor 
Tom McCall said it best. He said, ‘‘Or-
egon is an inspiration. Whether you 
come to it, or are born to it, you be-
come entranced by our State’s beauty, 
the opportunity she affords, and the 
independent spirit of her citizens.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I wish a happy 
birthday to Oregon. She truly does fly 
with her own wings. 
f 
REMEMBERING SECOND ANNIVER-
SARY OF MARJORY STONEMAN 
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL SHOOT-
ING 
(Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, it has 
been 2 years since the shooting at Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas High School in 
Parkland, Florida. 
In those 2 years, the surviving fami-
lies and students have turned their 
pain into power. They stood up to gun 
companies. They testified before Con-
gress. They helped craft and pass legis-
lation. They worked with the Federal 
Government. They worked with the 
State government. They won school 
board seats. They made beautiful, mov-
ing art. Students have lifted their 
voices, 
written 
songs. 
They 
have 
walked out and they have marched. 
That is what the survivors of my com-
munity are doing. 
But there is so much more that Con-
gress and the President can do to save 
lives from gun violence. There is so 
much more we can do to honor the 
lives that were lost at Stoneman Doug-
las: Alyssa, Scott, Martin, Nicholas, 
Aaron, Jaime, Chris, Luke, Cara, Gina, 
Joaquin, 
Alaina, 
Meadow, 
Helena, 
Alex, Carmen, and Peter.

RECOGNIZING SWEETWATER 
SOUND 
(Mr. BANKS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to share one of Fort Wayne’s 
great American success stories, Sweet-
water Sound. 
Founder and CEO Chuck Surack’s 
dream started over 40 years ago with a 
recording studio housed in a Volks-
wagen van. It has since evolved into 
one of the Nation’s leading retailers of 
professional 
recording 
and 
music 
equipment. 
Madam Speaker, Sweetwater’s total 
sales in 2018 were record breaking at 
$725 million. And just recently we 
found out that in 2019 it was another 
record year with sales of $805 million, 
up 11 percent from 2018. 
The total sales only tell part of the 
success story, though. Sweetwater has 
recently hired 159 new employees and 
has given back to Hoosiers by pro-
viding middle school students with free 
instruments. 
Hoosiers are thankful for Sweetwater 
Sound’s big contributions to northeast 
Indiana, and I look forward to watch-
ing them continue to succeed moving 
forward. In this record-setting econ-
omy, I look forward to seeing more 
American success stories just like this 
one.

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
CANNOT 
AFFORD 
TO 
TURN 
A 
BLIND 
EYE 
TO 
THE 
HUMANI-
TARIAN CRISIS IN SYRIA 
(Ms. WATERS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
stand today with the chair of our For-
eign Affairs Committee who just spoke 
here, Mr. ENGEL, as he makes a plea to 
this House for us to take a look at and 
get involved with what is going on in 
Syria. 
Millions of folks are dying. They are 
being killed with the help of Assad and 
Russia. They are killing civilians, mil-
lions of civilians. They are killing the 
children. And for those who are injured 
that find their way to the hospital, it 
does no good because they turn around 
and bomb the hospitals. This is an out-
rage. 
The United States of America cannot 
afford to turn a blind eye to this hu-
manitarian crisis. We must get in-
volved. We must pay attention. The 
families, the children, the people of 
Syria deserve better than this. 
I want to thank Mr. ENGEL for the at-
tention that he is paying to this issue 
and the way that he is trying to edu-
cate us and get us involved in saving 
those poor people who are being over-
run, who are being killed by Assad and, 
of course, with the help of Russia.

RECOGNIZING ABC LIFE CENTER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the ABC Life Center, a pregnancy 
center in Franklin, Pennsylvania in 
Venango County. 
The 
Life 
Center 
offers 
pregnant 
women a wide variety of resources, in-
cluding no-cost pregnancy tests, con-
sultations for women with unexpected 
pregnancies, adoption referrals, coun-
seling for women who have had a preg-
nancy end in miscarriage or abortion, 
and more. 
The Life Center recognizes that being 
pro-life means supporting all life. The 
center itself encourages women by let-
ting them know that their story, their 
life and their babies’ lives matter. The 
center also dispels the notion that to 
be pro-life is to be antichoice. 
In fact, pregnancy centers such as 
Life Center offer a great deal of choices 
and resources to women who find them-
selves unexpectedly pregnant. 
Pregnancy centers like ABC Life 
Center encourage and empower women 
all around the country. I am proud of 
the work that they do every day to en-
rich the lives of women and children, 
and together they help spread the mes-
sage that life really is a better choice.

CONTINUATION 
OF 
NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE 
UNITED 
STATES—MESSAGE 
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 116– 
99) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Armed Services 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
southern border of the United States 
declared in Proclamation 9844 of Feb-
ruary 15, 2019, is to continue in effect 
beyond February 15, 2020. 
The ongoing border security and hu-
manitarian crisis at the southern bor-
der of the United States continues to 
threaten our national security, includ-
ing the security of the American peo-
ple. The executive branch has taken 
steps to address the crisis, but further 
action is needed to address the humani-
tarian crisis and to control unlawful 
migration and the flow of narcotics and 
criminals across the southern border. 
For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Procla-
mation 9844 concerning the southern 
border of the United States. 
DONALD J. TRUMP.
THE WHITE HOUSE, February 13, 2020.

IMPORTANT ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, it is 
an honor to be able to stand in this 
hallowed Hall and address some things 
that have occurred that are worthy of 
attention. 
Of course, there was applause in the 
gallery today on the passage of trying 
to restart the ERA. It is an amendment 
to the Constitution, and it was started 
back in the seventies. The amendment 
to the Constitution had a deadline as 
part of the amendment. The amend-
ment did not get the required 38 states. 
The time lapsed. There was, as I recall, 
an attempt to extend the time, but 
some States that had been in favor of 
the ERA backed off. 
b 1145 
So it is very clear to anyone who 
pays attention to the Constitution 
that, when an amendment to the Con-
stitution by its own wording has a time 
deadline and that deadline is passed, 
then that amendment has not been 
ratified, is not part of the Constitu-
tion, and any efforts to change the 
amendment itself, including the dead-
line for ratification, would require be-
ginning again. 
There is no more iconic liberal judge 
on the Supreme Court, not in history, 
than the former head, as I recall, of the 
American Civil Liberties Union. She 
was there back when the American 
Civil Liberties Union cared deeply 
about civil liberties and even took on 
some clients and some causes of people 
that most of us thought were not wor-
thy of a lot of attention. But they were 
so committed to civil liberties back in 
those days, they were more concerned 
about civil liberties than they were the 
client. That was in the old days. 
Now, if it is not a liberal, then they 
are not concerned about civil liberties 
and abuses, since the Obama adminis-
tration was the administration that so 
far appears to be the most abusive of 
the FISA courts, committing fraud 
upon the FISA courts. 
But in fairness to the administration, 
it appears the FISA court judges did 
not have sufficient integrity or pride in 
their position that they were offended 
by having fraud committed upon them, 
because, apparently, the disdain for 
Donald Trump, then President Trump 
and his administration was such that it 
was okay. They were okay to be de-
frauded as judges, which sure brings

the issue of the FISA courts into focus 
as that issue will be taken up, as I un-
derstand it, as will issues over parts of 
the PATRIOT Act and other provisions 
that give the Federal Government tre-
mendous latitude to spy on American 
citizens. 
So it is an interesting time, though, 
where you never know where judges are 
going to come down. If somebody was 
appointed by a liberal judge, it is amaz-
ing; they appear to stay liberal, with 
disdain for conservatism and the strict 
language of the Constitution, wanting 
it to be a liberal, breathing, living doc-
ument. 
On the other hand, Chief Justice Rob-
erts has pointed out he doesn’t believe 
there should be Obama judges or 
Trump judges or Bush judges because 
you can’t characterize them that way. 
To an extent, he is right about that, 
because there are some Justices, par-
ticularly on the Supreme Court, who 
have been appointed by conservative 
Presidents who were liberals in con-
servative clothing, and they got on the 
Court and became some of the biggest 
flaming liberals we have ever had. 
So you can’t tell that someone is 
conservative if they are appointed by a 
conservative President, but you sure 
can tell if somebody is appointed by a 
liberal President. They have shown 
that they will stay liberal and not 
change. So it has been interesting to 
see that kind of conversion. 
It appears pretty clear that some of 
these Justices, including Chief Justice 
Roberts, got into the position and 
began to care deeply about what the 
media and others thought about things 
they were doing. 
So, for example, with ObamaCare, he 
was, apparently, from the reports, con-
cerned that he might go down in his-
tory as being too political of a Chief 
Justice if he struck down ObamaCare. 
So he took something that was clearly 
unconstitutional, in effect, rewrote it, 
and had a very hypocritical opinion. 
At page 14, I believe it was, he said, 
clearly, this is not a tax, because if it 
were a tax, Congress would have called 
it a tax, and they made clear it was 
not; and it is only a penalty, a fine, if 
you don’t conform your conduct to the 
requirements of the legislation. There-
fore, it is not a tax. 
Since it is not a tax, then the anti-in-
junction law that prevents a plaintiff 
from filing suit until a tax is not only 
assessed but paid and keeps the court 
from having jurisdiction to hear it 
until the tax is assessed and paid, that 
doesn’t apply, so the court can take 
this matter up. And now that we take 
it up, 40 pages later, he said it is con-
stitutional, in effect, because it is a 
tax. 
So he had to go through all kinds of 
mental gymnastics to what, in his 
mind, would prevent him from being 
classified as a political Chief Justice; 
but, as a result, he has become one the 
most political Chief Justices we have 
ever had—unfortunately for him and 
the country. 
So who knows. Maybe there will be 
people on the Supreme Court who will 
decide to rewrite the Constitution as 
he, in effect, rewrote the ObamaCare 
statute. But if you are actually going 
to follow the Constitution the way it is 
written and you are not going to re-
write the Constitution at the Supreme 
Court level, then the truth is, when an 
amendment fails by its own language 
and is not ratified, then anybody with 
any sense would understand you have 
got to start over. 
Though I have plenty of disagree-
ments with Justice Ginsberg over some 
issues, she has tried to be a person of 
integrity. Talking about the ERA, she 
says: 
I would like to see a new beginning. I’d 
like it to start over. There is too much con-
troversy about latecomers—Virginia—long 
after the deadline passed. Plus, a number of 
States have withdrawn their ratification. So 
if you count a latecomer on the plus side, 
how can you disregard the States that said, 
‘‘We have changed our minds’’? 
So it is interesting. Yes, this legisla-
tion passed. 
JIM SENSENBRENNER from Wisconsin 
appropriately brought up the point 
that this is actually amending the Con-
stitution; it is amending the constitu-
tional amendment. So, to be appro-
priate, it is going to require a two- 
thirds vote in the House, a two-thirds 
vote in the Senate, and then 38 States, 
I believe it is, in order to have it rati-
fied. 
That was overruled to reinforce the 
fact that what we did today is really 
not constitutional. If we had tried to 
ratify it as a new amendment, like Jus-
tice Ginsberg was talking about, a new 
constitutional amendment, then, actu-
ally, you would, as Justice Ginsberg 
said, have to be starting the process all 
over again, and that does require a 
two-thirds vote here and in the Senate. 
So what we did today made people 
that support it feel good, but it is not 
going anywhere; and even if it were, 
hypothetically, it just simply can’t 
pass constitutional muster at the Su-
preme Court. A majority of the Court 
appears to believe that the Constitu-
tion means what it says. 
We had one vote today. It was on the 
ERA. So we didn’t do anything terribly 
effective today as the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Also, I noted before I came over for 
the vote that, apparently, the chair-
man of the Judiciary Committee, it 
was reported—I don’t know if other 
members of the majority signed the 
letter, but there was a letter to Attor-
ney General Barr, and it expressed 
what sounded like the distress of the 
committee 
over 
Attorney 
General 
Barr’s action in reining in prosecutors 
who have simply gotten out of hand. 
Attorney General Barr has the dis-
tinct advantage of having a bigger pic-
ture than these four very politically 
motivated prosecutors who were push-
ing so hard for virtually the maximum 
amount of time for Roger Stone to 
serve in prison. 
Anyway, if that letter was going to 
be truly accurate, it needed to say that 
this majority that has been trying to 
throw President Trump out of office, 
that has been using taxpayer funds for 
a number of years now to try to defeat 
President Trump in the 2020 election, 
which voted for impeachment knowing 
that President Trump was not going to 
be removed from office—so it seems the 
logical conclusion is, again, they were 
using taxpayer funds to campaign 
against President Trump, hoping they 
could besmirch him sufficiently, slan-
der his name sufficiently, that it would 
help them defeat him in November. 
Whereas, the minority of the com-
mittee did not agree with the letter be-
cause it appears clear to all of the mi-
nority I have talked to that Attorney 
General Barr is trying to do something 
and incorporate something called fair-
ness in our legal system, because he 
has seen you had people in the previous 
administration 
who 
strong-armed 
salespeople into selling guns to people 
they knew should not have them and 
that they would end up in the hands of, 
most likely, Mexican drug cartels. And 
that is what the administration wanted 
to do. They were assuring they would 
be able to follow the guns and inter-
cede, but that is not what happened. 
Then we even saw emails that, after 
this was all exposed, there was an idea 
that, gee, maybe we can still use the 
fact that these guns went into criminal 
hands, even killed one of our own 
United States agents, a brave soul, 
Brian Terry, they were hopeful they 
could still use that to get antigun leg-
islation passed simply based on their 
criminal activity in trying to get these 
guns into the hands of criminals who 
shouldn’t have them. 
So nobody was held accountable for 
that. Nobody was held accountable for 
the guns that were forced into the 
hands of criminals, ultimately, one of 
which killed Brian Terry. Nobody was 
held accountable for any of that. 
Nobody was held accountable for de-
stroying evidence after it was subpoe-
naed, even with a hammer, even with 
applications like BleachBit, destroying 
subpoenaed evidence. Nobody was held 
accountable for any of that. 
So across the Nation, it appears 
maybe a small majority, but a major-
ity, understand and believe that there 
are two forms of justice in America: 
one for those high-ranking Democratic 
officials who are never held account-
able at all, and one for Republicans 
whose lives are attempted to be de-
stroyed and, in some cases, are de-
stroyed. 
b 1200 
In some cases, they did nothing 
wrong. In other cases, they agreed to 
plead to something just because the 
bully Federal prosecutors have threat-
ened to go after their family and con-
tinue to harass them. 
I saw a former Member of Congress 
from Pennsylvania who had been blast-
ing the FBI back during my first term,

2005–2006, and he was blasting them be-
cause he said—and I had not heard of it 
before, at the time—but a program 
called Able Danger had been able to 
identify a majority of the 9/11 hijack-
ers. The FBI had that information. 
They did nothing with it. 
I didn’t know if Curt Weldon, the 
Member of Congress from Pennsyl-
vania, was accurate in what he was 
saying, but hearing him make these 
speeches over and over about how the 
FBI should have acted. They could 
have prevented thousands of lives from 
being taken, all of those people from 
having to jump to their deaths because 
they didn’t want to be burned at the 
top of the World Trade Center. All of 
that could have been avoided if the FBI 
had stepped in and used the informa-
tion they had to stop 9/11. 
I didn’t know if that was true or not, 
but I was thinking, you know, Mueller 
and the FBI have to respond to Con-
gressman Weldon in some way. They 
have to. This is really serious stuff. I 
thought they would make a statement 
and that they would come back with 
evidence to refute what he was saying, 
but they never did that. 
What Mueller’s FBI did, though—it 
had to be with his approval, going after 
a Member of Congress. It was believed 
that they got a warrant because they 
raided his daughter’s law office. They 
alerted the media for the early morn-
ing raids so there was plenty of media 
there and plenty of media at his con-
gressional office. People were appar-
ently warned in advance by the FBI be-
cause nobody else knew. 
They showed up with preprinted 
signs condemning Curt Weldon, caught 
red-handed, all of this stuff. It turned 
out, there was nothing ever done. He 
told me that, months later, he was con-
tacted by the FBI and told: You can 
come get all of this material we seized 
in the raid. 
They did the raid 2 weeks before the 
election, as I recall, about 2 weeks be-
fore the election. So the FBI, under 
Mueller, was able to singlehandedly de-
feat Curt Weldon. It helped the Demo-
crat opponent to defeat Curt Weldon in 
the narrow loss that he had. 
So the FBI didn’t respond with evi-
dence. They just helped manipulate the 
election system so Curt Weldon would 
lose. He did, and he said that they told 
him to come pick up all of this stuff. 
They never did present it to a grand 
jury anyway. That was kind of shock-
ing. 
So, clearly, Mueller and his FBI were 
motivated by shutting him up so he 
couldn’t make speeches on the House 
floor anymore, and that is why the raid 
was conducted. But in his last most re-
cent visit, Curt was telling me that— 
by the way, before I wrote about Curt 
Weldon, I had not seen him nor talked 
with him since 2006 when he left. I put 
that in the booklet I wrote titled ‘‘Rob-
ert Mueller: Unmasked.’’ I wrote about 
what happened to Curt. 
At this most recent visit this year, 
he told me that, as he understands, it 
turns out the FBI never even got a war-
rant. They just raided the office with-
out a warrant, like any good dictator 
would have, the brownshirts. Law en-
forcement does, in places: We don’t 
need a stinking warrant. We will just 
go harass and destroy. 
That is really shocking if there was 
not even a warrant. But Mueller was ir-
ritated, apparently, with Ted Stevens, 
so the FBI framed Ted Stevens. It 
turned out, after he was convicted 
right before his election—he lost nar-
rowly as a U.S. Senator—an FBI agent 
filed an affidavit and established how 
they had created a case against Ted 
Stevens that didn’t exist. 
Actually, Ted Stevens had overpaid 
for improvements to his home. It 
wasn’t an illegal gift. He had overpaid, 
at one point telling the contractor: 
Look, I know I am overpaying, but I 
have people watching. I have to do ev-
erything by the book, so just cash the 
check—that kind of thing. 
Anyway, Mueller and his FBI helped 
defeat Ted Stevens by convicting him 
right before his election. But then that 
conviction was thrown out due to the 
prosecutorial misconduct and, I would 
say, crimes committed by at least one 
FBI agent, if not more, and also by 
prosecutors. 
They should have gone to prison for 
what they did, but I can’t help but 
think that between what the FBI did to 
Curt Weldon, what they did to Ted Ste-
vens, what they have done to other 
people with whom they disagree, that 
it had become a very dangerous place 
where, if you were in the right political 
persuasion or took the right positions 
on the right issues, then you could 
commit crimes, and the FBI would 
leave you alone. 
If you were of the wrong political po-
sitions, on the wrong issues, they 
would come after you even if they had 
to frame you or set you up, as they did 
Ted Stevens and Curt Weldon, destroy-
ing their political careers. 
So we are at a very dangerous time 
in this country’s history. It used to be 
that the FBI had the reputation that it 
was the most trustworthy, effective 
law enforcement agency body in the 
world. But that has changed. 
Unfortunately, we have an FBI Direc-
tor—an article said, at one time, back 
in the Bush administration, he had told 
James Comey, who has lied, obviously 
committed crimes—and we can debate 
about how high or low of a level. But 
he told Comey: Look, if you and 
Mueller are going to make a move, I 
want to be with you guys. I want to go 
where you are going, when you are 
going. 
Well, that guy who thought so highly 
of Mueller and Comey was put in a 
place he never should have been, and 
that is FBI Director at a time that 
needed cleaning up. 
So I am hopeful that in the days, 
weeks, or months ahead, we will get a 
new FBI Director who will be serious 
about punishing wrongdoing in the 
FBI, which I believe will help them get 
back their reputation. 
The more Christopher Wray appears 
to do more covering up than he does 
making accountable, he really needs to 
go sooner rather than later. They are 
not going to get their reputation back 
simply by ignoring things. 
Of course, the FISA court pointed 
out in an order, after going for years 
without having any pride or integrity 
in enforcing their jurisdiction and 
being offended by fraud upon the court, 
it finally came out and said: Okay, this 
one guy, Clinesmith, had changed the 
wording, basically going from saying 
he did work for the U.S. Government or 
the CIA to saying he did not. 
So, clearly, 180 degrees opposite of 
what the truth was, knowing it was 
false, he submitted it to the court. But 
that had been clear for months, if not 
years, and the courts did nothing. 
It is what keeps compelling me to 
think maybe we just need to get rid of 
the FISA court system and come up 
with a new way, because I am not sure 
that the court with the judges who 
have been appointed to be FISA judges, 
that we can save that system, that 
Americans can feel comfortable that 
their privacy and their civil rights are 
not being violated by an overzealous 
group, especially when you look at the 
thousands and thousands of FISA or-
ders. In 2018, out of mass applications 
for warrants from the FISA court, I 
think there was only one they turned 
down. 
Some say: Well, maybe if we have an 
amicus, a friend of the court who will 
stand up for the party against whom a 
warrant is sought, maybe that would 
help provide enough protection for 
American civil liberties. 
But then we saw in December, I be-
lieve it was, FISA court, feeling the 
heat of all of those who have come to 
distrust FISA courts, appointed an 
amicus. It turned out the judge ap-
pointed the very lawyer who for years 
had been trashing DEVIN NUNES and 
others, who it turns out were 100 per-
cent right in the things they said in 
their report. 
So it appeared clear that the FISA 
court was not serious about making 
fixes or changes or protecting civil lib-
erties, but also it had gone into the 
Christopher Wray mode of covering up, 
hoping people wouldn’t notice that so 
much illegality and impropriety had 
been going on. 
We are going to be taking up these 
issues, the controversial section 215 
from the PATRIOT Act and other 
things. Hopefully, we will take up the 
FISA court. 
I am hopeful that we will have bipar-
tisan action because I know from my 
time on the Judiciary Committee, 
there 
have 
been 
Democrats—pre-
viously, Chairman NADLER had been a 
staunch proponent of protecting civil 
liberties, but that appears to be more, 
nowadays, only protecting civil lib-
erties if you are a Democrat, but not so 
much if you are part of the Trump ad-
ministration or a friend of the Presi-
dent.

February 13, 2020 
Hopefully, we can get past some of 
that and do some good and actually do 
the job of protecting civil liberties. 
I have talked to Congresswoman ZOE 
LOFGREN
over the years, including 
more recently, because she, in the past, 
has been quite zealous for civil lib-
erties. I understand she has a bill. 
Hopefully, that will be helpful in deal-
ing with some of these issues. 
But I am still concerned that the 
abuses may have grown so profound 
that we may not be able to fix the 
FISA court system. We may need to do 
as some have said—I think RAND PAUL 
has talked about just getting rid of it. 
But we will see where we go. 
That same kind of duality justice or 
dual justice has raised its ugly head in 
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Dis-
trict of Columbia. Jessie Liu was the 
U.S. attorney for the District of Co-
lumbia, and she had some people, it 
turns out, who were extremely par-
tisan. 
In fact, in a case involving Imran 
Awan, an IT technician here, involved 
with working with computers for doz-
ens of Democrats on Capitol Hill—since 
2004, he had worked, like I say, for doz-
ens of Democratic Representatives. 
And it is one of the things up here on 
the Hill, if a Member of Congress tells 
you, ‘‘Oh, this is my computer person. 
He is great. She is great,’’ then others 
will say, ‘‘oh, I need somebody, so I 
will hire them.’’ 
Normally, somebody who does that, 
since you don’t need them full time, 
they work part time. Under the rules, 
they are allowed to work for multiple 
offices as long as their income does not 
exceed the maximum amount allowed— 
I think it was around $170,000, some-
thing like that. You could work for 
multiple offices and accumulate up to 
that maximum. You can have multiple 
part-time employees. Apparently, that 
is what Imran Awan did, and he had a 
brother. 
If you are going to do that kind of 
work, you have to file financial infor-
mation, financial statement informa-
tion. It turns out, he didn’t disclose 
about selling cars or some of the assets 
or businesses he had, and that is a Fed-
eral felony. 
b 1215 
He also had filed under the require-
ments here if you buy something, and I 
think it is $500 or more, then you have 
to have the serial number, you have to 
keep track of it, and you have to be 
able to document where that item is at 
all times if it costs more than $500. 
When I came into office in 2005, there 
was some couch that was on my inven-
tory. Nobody had seen the couch in 
many years, but I was told you can’t 
take it off your inventory because it is 
part of your office. Well, if it had cost 
less than $500 then that would not have 
been an issue. I have no idea where 
that couch was or is. It wasn’t around 
when I got here. 
But Imran Awan, apparently to get 
around the requirement of keeping se-
rial numbers and keeping track of 
things that he purchased allegedly on 
behalf of Congress Members for whom 
he worked, he would list iPads that 
cost $799 as costing $499 and then say 
that an insurance policy for it cost 
$300, and that way it got around the re-
quirement of keeping information on 
where those specific items were. 
It turns out from, what I have read, 
it appears he and his brother owed six 
figures to somebody foreign, I believe. 
And so instead of paying the person 
back, they put this guy, who was not a 
computer technician—just had various 
Members, oh, apparently he told them, 
this guy is going to help with your 
computer system, so we need you to 
put him on part-time for your office. 
So he had the Federal taxpayers paying 
their debt to this guy. 
It turns out he had two wives, and 
one was saying he had a tremendous 
amount of money. He is from Pakistan, 
and when he goes back, he is treated 
like a king by the secret police there, 
I believe it was ISI. He is constantly 
sending all kinds of computer equip-
ment back to Pakistan since he was a 
Pakistan national. 
Anyway, he had some ties with some 
very questionable people. It sounds like 
maybe the FISA court should have 
been issuing warrants to look at some 
of his stuff. 
He was arrested in July of 2017 over 
his alleged involvement in double 
charging House Democrats for House 
IT equipment, House computer-type 
equipment, and privately exposing pri-
vate information online. A probe of 
him found more than tens of thousands 
of dollars in computer technical equip-
ment had been stolen. 
He was indicted by a Federal District 
Court in August of 2017 for ‘‘conspiracy 
to commit bank fraud, bank fraud, 
making false statements on a loan or 
credit application, and engaging in un-
lawful monetary transactions.’’ 
As I recall, he had, I believe it was a 
cousin who worked at McDonald’s. He 
got him listed on the payroll for dif-
ferent House Members. I am sure they 
didn’t know that he wasn’t working. So 
he helped out the family by bringing in 
extra income for family members. Each 
one of those events would have been a 
Federal felony. 
Evidence indicates that Imran Awan 
and his team members were copying 
data from the computers of House 
Members to the House Democratic Cau-
cus server and then even to private 
Dropbox 
accounts—totally 
inappro-
priate and absolute wrongdoing. 
He and his associates were even 
tossed off the House computer system 
because they provided false informa-
tion to Capitol Police that being a fake 
copy of the Democratic Caucus’ server. 
But incredibly none of that was used 
by Jessie Liu’s attorneys against him. 
Instead, the U.S. Attorney’s office for 
the District of Columbia opted to let 
him plead to a charge of just making a 
false statement on a loan application, 
disregarding the many, many felonies 
that could have been charged and pur-
sued to just find out: Why are you such 
a hero back in Pakistan? 
What equipment are you sending 
back there? 
Where are you getting it from? 
How come you committed a felony by 
not listing your car dealership? 
Because as our intel people can tell 
you, Madam Speaker, one of the ways 
that money is raised for terrorist ac-
tivity is through bogus car dealerships 
where cars are stolen and then shipped. 
We don’t know what the situation was 
with Imran Awan’s alleged car dealer-
ship because he didn’t have a dealer lot 
anywhere. 
It is handy, though, no matter who 
you are, if you can have taxpayers pay 
back your loans by just listing them on 
the payroll of people whom you lied to 
about who is doing the work. 
The problem, though, if Jessie Liu 
and these Democrat attorneys in the 
D.C. U.S. Attorneys’ Office had pursued 
Imran for anything other than making 
a false statement on his loan, then 
there would have been a lot of embar-
rassment for Democratic Members of 
Congress because they had some guy 
like that who was cheating taxpayers, 
cheating the government, and commit-
ting crimes working for them. In fair-
ness, it is hard to believe they would 
have known the kinds of things he was 
doing and getting away with. Anyway, 
the Federal judge sentenced him. 
He filed saying he was broke, and he 
had no money. One of his wives said 
she was threatened by the FBI to keep 
her mouth shut, but she had indicated 
that he had all kinds of money. He had 
gold, and he had all kinds of money 
that he had been able to save while 
working for all these different Mem-
bers of Congress. But he said he was 
broke. He filed something saying he 
was broke, and he couldn’t pay any-
thing. But then it came down to, in 
order to get probation he had to pay 
back six figures to the government. 
Somehow, he magically came up—I 
can’t remember if it was 100 or 
$200,000—he came up with it. He paid it, 
even though he alleged he was flat 
broke. 
So when we hear about four Federal 
prosecutors who worked for U.S. Attor-
ney of D.C. Jessie Liu being all upset 
over the Department of Justice want-
ing fairness for Roger Stone and not 
political vengeance, four of them quit. 
In analyzing who it is and what they 
were doing and why they quit, I think 
it is important to see who they are. 
There have been some good articles 
written about these people just in the 
last week. 
Jonathan Kravis was appointed by 
former President Obama to be asso-
ciate White House Counsel where he 
served in 2009 and 2010. He worked for 
Williams & Connolly, a lobbying firm 
for which Kravis had worked. It has a 
long history of its employees donating 
large sums of money to Democratic 
candidates, organizations, and causes. 
He worked with Adam Jed to pros-
ecute Paul Manafort. They went after

him with a vengeance for working for 
the Ukrainian Government. Manafort 
was cleared of all charges except two 
counts of conspiracy to defraud the 
U.S., for which Manafort is serving a 5- 
year prison sentence. 
Kravis and his wife are connected 
with Codepink that most people around 
here know is a far left, anti-war organi-
zation. 
Then Adam Jed, himself, apparently 
did work in 2003 or was a fellow at Hu-
manity in Action group, a far-left-wing 
organization blatantly against polit-
ical diversity. 
He defended the Affordable Care Act 
contraceptive mandate in the case Lit-
tle Sisters of the Poor v. Sebelius. That 
is where the Federal Government was 
going after these nuns who took a vow 
of poverty but also a vow to help peo-
ple, and they believed it was against 
their religion to help pay for abortions. 
Mr. Jed had no problem in pursuing 
these poor nuns. That is his choice, but 
it does give an indication of where he 
stood, and it is certainly not anywhere 
close to the beliefs on the pro-life posi-
tions of Donald Trump. 
Adam Jed also provided oral argu-
ments to strike down the Defense of 
Marriage Act in the Defense of Mar-
riage Act v. Windsor. 
He contributed $1,000 to Josh Kaul’s 
candidacy for Wisconsin State Attor-
ney General. Of course, Kaul was a law-
yer for Perkins Coie which funneled 
money from the Hillary Clinton cam-
paign to Christopher Steele who was 
the British spy who also apparently 
utilized other foreigners to try to af-
fect the U.S. election in 2016. So, obvi-
ously, Adam Jed would have been sup-
porting Kaul who worked for Perkins 
Coie. 
I know we don’t hear a whole lot 
about it from the other side of the 
aisle, but the Hillary Clinton campaign 
and the DNC actually paid foreigners 
to try to affect our 2016 election. 
I constantly hear about how out-
rageous it was that the now-debunked 
allegations that the Trump campaign 
conspired with Russia to affect our 
election, they don’t want to talk about 
what is slam-dunk proved that the 
DNC and the Clinton campaign abso-
lutely did pay foreigners to try to af-
fect our election. One foreigner from 
Italy was involved and a foreigner from 
Australia. 
I know people like to say that there 
were no Ukrainians involved. That is 
totally debunked. The mere fact that 
Russia has constantly tried to affect 
our elections—so has China and so have 
other countries—does not mutually ex-
clude the fact that there were Ukrain-
ians who tried to affect our 2016 elec-
tion. Exhibit A to me, Madam Speaker, 
would be you had the ambassador from 
Ukraine to the U.S. write an op-ed try-
ing to prevent Donald Trump from 
being elected President. 
That is foreign interference within 
an election. So, anyway, I don’t know 
where they are getting this stuff, oh, 
that is Russian propaganda. The only 
Russian propaganda that has been the 
most effective is propaganda from Rus-
sia that wants to divide America, and 
they have done a marvelous job at di-
viding America instead of bringing us 
together. 
One of the other attorneys who re-
signed all upset about the treatment 
of—well, Attorney General Barr want-
ing them to pull their fangs back in 
and not try to be so vengeful simply 
because Roger Stone was a friend of 
the President. There is no indication 
the President had hired him to do any-
thing, but they sure went after him be-
cause of a connection. 
Michael 
Marando 
prosecuted 
the 
Imran Awan case. He is the guy who let 
him get away with all of this other ac-
tivity without proper investigation. 
In fact, there was an inspector gen-
eral here. She ended up being, I think, 
president of some international tech-
nology organization. She was amazing. 
She had all kinds of evidence to prove 
felony cases against Imran Awan, but 
representatives from the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office, I don’t know if it was Mi-
chael Marando himself, the FBI, work-
ing at their behest, ended up threat-
ening her: Don’t you bring your note-
book with all that evidence. 
Then they turned around and later 
reportedly said: Oh, we interviewed 
her, she didn’t have anything. 
Yes, when you ordered her not to 
bring it to show you the cases against 
Imran Awan. 
b 1230 
But that is Michael Marando. He laid 
him off with a wrist slap. I don’t see 
how you can find any other basis other 
than Marando’s political motivation. 
But he didn’t pursue any of these other 
charges, and the question still exists. 
As I understand, Imran Awan has 
filed a lawsuit, and it appears his in-
tention is to try to get back on the 
gravy train here where he was on Cap-
itol Hill, to get people to sign up to use 
him. I think there are enough people 
who got burned that it would probably 
be hard for him to do. 
But a lawsuit, of course, when I heard 
that he has a lawsuit, that means dis-
covery is in order. I am hopeful dis-
covery will bring out all the lies and 
the crimes that it appears that he has 
committed. But no thanks to Michael 
Marando. He certainly didn’t do any-
thing that would have hurt Democrats 
on Capitol Hill but went out of his way 
to want to destroy Roger Stone. 
Aaron Zelensky started his career as 
a special assistant to Koh, who was the 
State Department legal adviser in the 
Obama administration, but he has also 
clerked for what I felt was one of the 
most liberal judges ever, Supreme 
Court Justice John Paul Stevens. 
He played a key role in obtaining a 
guilty plea from a guy who was an ad-
viser at one time, Papadopoulos. This 
poor guy, he didn’t have money. When 
the FBI and the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s 
Office came after him, Mueller’s peo-
ple, he didn’t have money to fight. 
He was being overwhelmed. They in-
timidated him enough into his agreeing 
to plead guilty to a minor charge. 
But Zelensky was handpicked by 
Mueller when he was selecting people 
who hated Trump. Zelensky was hand-
picked to be an investigator in that 
probe. Before joining the Mueller team, 
Zelensky worked for Deputy Attorney 
General Rod Rosenstein. 
Anyway, these people certainly had a 
lot of political baggage. They were 
clearly on a vendetta. They weren’t 
pursuing justice. They were pursuing 
political vendettas, trying to get at 
President Trump. 
There are tens of millions of dollars 
that were spent investigating what we 
now know was the Russia hoax. There 
was no collusion or conspiracy between 
the Trump campaign and Russia, de-
spite what people are trying to allude 
to now. It wasn’t. The evidence wasn’t 
there. 
Mueller 
was 
disappointed. 
Weissmann was disappointed. All of 
these left-wingers were disappointed 
that, despite all the intimidation, all 
the threats, they couldn’t find some-
body who could actually implicate any 
kind of collusion or conspiracy between 
the Trump campaign and Russia. 
But on Roger Stone’s sentencing, 
when he was convicted, one of the 
charges was witness tampering. It sure 
sounds like he was kidding around by 
saying: Hey, I may have to come over 
and kill your dog. 
I mean, who says that if they are not 
kidding? That is not all that effective 
of a threat. But when you have a judge 
who can’t stand the Trump administra-
tion, and you have a juror who gets 
on—I would really like to know what 
kind of questions the jury was asked 
during voir dire. If Roger Stone’s attor-
neys did not ask the jury panel their 
feelings about Donald Trump, then it 
sure sounds like that would have been 
malpractice. Roger should have a great 
case against his own lawyers, plus a 
great case on appeal for their impro-
priety as his attorneys. 
But I find it hard to believe they 
wouldn’t ask something about that be-
cause there is clearly some type of 
Trump 
derangement 
system. 
Some 
very smart, well-balanced people get so 
angry and frustrated over President 
Donald Trump that they don’t think as 
straight as they normally would. 
But to have the foreperson of the 
jury, the head juror who controls the 
discussions, shut people down, encour-
age other people to speak—the head 
foreperson hates Donald Trump. 
Anyway, it is amazing the efforts 
that the Department of Justice, at 
least the U.S. Attorney’s Office, had 
gone to, to become a tool for injustice. 
They wanted to max this guy out, the 
poor guy. Unbelievable. 
I have sent people to prison for life. I 
have sent people to prison for 10 years, 
9 years. I have had to look people in 
the eye and order them to be taken to 
the Texas Department of Criminal Jus-
tice and put to death. Those are serious 
matters, and you simply cannot let any

type of vengeance or political persua-
sion affect you. 
I know in east Texas, we have assist-
ant U.S. attorneys who vote Democrat. 
But when it comes to enforcing the 
law, they enforce the law. They don’t 
care what party you are. And it is so 
tragic, right here in our Nation’s Cap-
ital, our own Justice Department, in 
our own D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office, 
you have people who are not nearly as 
just and fair as you find all over the 
country in most U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fices. 
Another issue of the local D.C. U.S. 
Attorney’s Office was a guy named 
James Wolfe. He was indicted by a Fed-
eral grand jury on three counts of vio-
lating title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1001. 
At the time he made the alleged false 
statements to the FBI, James Wolfe 
was director of security for the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence, and 
that was a position he had held for 
about 29 years. 
As the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence director of security, James 
Wolfe was entrusted with access to 
classified, secret, and top-secret infor-
mation 
provided 
by 
the 
executive 
branch, including the United States in-
telligence community that they pro-
vided to the Senate Select Committee 
on Intelligence. 
Wolfe was alleged to have lied to FBI 
agents in December 2017 about his re-
peated contacts with three reporters, 
including through his use of encrypted 
messaging applications. Wolfe is fur-
ther alleged to have made false state-
ments to the FBI about providing two 
reporters with nonpublic information 
related to the matters occurring before 
the Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence. 
He was sentenced to 2 months in pris-
on, 4 months supervised release for 
lying to the FBI. He has to complete 20 
hours of community service—20 hours a 
month during his release for those 4 
months—and pay a $7,500 fine. 
You compare what he did with what 
Roger Stone did. Roger Stone wasn’t 
dealing with any classified informa-
tion, secret or top secret. He used some 
bad judgment. But Jesse Liu’s attor-
neys, these four who have now quit— 
thank God they quit. 
We need to get some people in there 
where, when it comes to prosecuting, it 
doesn’t matter what the defendant’s 
political persuasion is. You seek jus-
tice. And there are Democratic and Re-
publican 
attorneys, 
prosecutors, 
around the country who are quite capa-
ble of doing that. So I sure hope that 
we will get some better attorneys in 
the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office. 
It is amazing. I thought about Ser-
geant York, that movie. I believe Gary 
Cooper played Sergeant York. They 
were in the trenches, and they couldn’t 
see the bad guys to stop them. He ends 
up using a turkey call that he used 
back when he was turkey hunting. One 
after another, enemy soldiers would 
stick their head up, and he was able to 
knock them off and eventually capture 
this huge group. But in order to pre-
vail, they had to get them to stick 
their heads up. 
I think that is what this Trump de-
rangement syndrome has done. There 
are people who have been working per-
vasively and, apparently, with political 
vendettas, but they have been able to 
stay below the radar. Along comes 
President Trump, and they get so de-
ranged that they expose who they are. 
So I thank all those political oppor-
tunists and zealots who use their posi-
tion in the U.S. Government, including 
the Department of Justice, who have 
now exposed themselves. 
Vindman is one those people who 
have exposed his animosity, and it is 
really good that he is no longer part of 
the National Security Council. It is 
good his brother is no longer in the Of-
fice of General Counsel. I think we will 
see less leaks now that he is gone from 
there. 
Anyway, we are starting to see those 
people who have exposed themselves as 
political operatives, rather than doing 
justice, or following the orders of their 
Commander in Chief, we are seeing 
them exposed. We are seeing them 
moved out. 
I am hoping, in the days ahead, there 
will be a lot more of that occurring. I 
think justice will be served better so 
the American people can feel more 
like—and not one party or another. 
People need to be able to feel, as a 
whole, regardless of the political per-
suasion of some prosecutor, that jus-
tice is being pursued and done, as it is 
being done in so many Federal districts 
all over the country. It has been a 
problem here in Washington, D.C. 
When that happens, we will all be 
better off. 
Madam Speaker, with that, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
f 
HONORING DR. STEPHEN A. 
HOLDITCH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. FLORES) for 
30 minutes. 
(Mr. FLORES asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. Stephen A. Holditch 
of College Station, Texas, who passed 
away unexpectedly on August 9, 2019. 
Before I continue our discussion 
about Steve, I want to give some con-
text about the importance of his pro-
fessional career. 
Let me state, first, that Steve con-
sidered his roles as a husband, a father, 
and a grandfather to be his most im-
portant. Because of the exceptional 
way that he lived those roles, his leg-
acy is readily apparent in the lives of 
those he left behind—his wife, Ann; his 
daughters, Katie and Abbie; and their 
five grandchildren. 
The discussion of his professional ac-
complishments starts with a descrip-
tion of current energy metrics. 
Today, the United States of America 
is blessed to be the number one pro-
ducer of oil and gas in the world. As of 
this year, we are a net exporter of oil 
and natural gas. Reserves of American 
oil and natural gas rank us among the 
top 10 countries in the world. We also 
lead the industrialized world in the re-
duction of carbon dioxide emissions 
over the last two decades. 
b 1245 
Ten years ago, no one would have 
ever predicted that we would be where 
we are today. 
This new world of American energy 
dominance is having dramatic implica-
tions, both domestically and inter-
nationally. We have secure, stable, en-
vironmentally responsible, and attrac-
tively-priced energy sources for Amer-
ican families and businesses. We have 
become a reliable source of energy for 
our allies, giving them flexibility to 
move away from unstable Russian and 
Middle Eastern energy suppliers. 
The oil and gas sector of our econ-
omy has created millions of good jobs 
and great paychecks for hardworking 
Americans. Our balance of trade pay-
ments has improved, and our geo-
political position has strengthened. 
This dramatic energy renaissance 
didn’t happen by accident or because of 
government. It is because of the result 
of American ingenuity, research, and 
bold leadership. While no one person is 
solely responsible for this seismic shift 
in American energy, there are a num-
ber of bold leaders who took these chal-
lenges that looked impossible to solve 
and then solved them; particularly in 
the area of stimulation of low perme-
ability, or ‘‘tight’’ reservoirs. Their de-
velopments, studies, research, and field 
experiments using horizontal drilling 
and very large hydraulic fracturing 
treatments 
revolutionized 
American 
oil and natural gas and transformed 
our economy and our security. 
One of those bold leaders was the late 
George P. Mitchell, Texas A&M Class 
of 1940. Another is the person that we 
are honoring today, Dr. Stephen A. 
Holditch, Texas A&M Class of 1969. 
Stephen Holditch was born on Octo-
ber 20, 1946, in Corsicana, Texas, to 
Damon and Margie Holditch. Growing 
up, Steve and his family moved often 
while his father pursued a career in the 
oil and gas industry. He spent most of 
his childhood in San Antonio before 
moving to Richardson, Texas for his 
final year of high school, where he 
graduated in 1965. 
Following 
graduation, 
Steve 
at-
tended Texas A&M University, where 
he joined the Corps of Cadets and began 
his journey as a Fighting Texas Aggie. 
Steve quickly excelled, both in aca-
demics and in the Corps of Cadets. 
While at A&M, he was a member of 
Company F–1, a member of the pres-
tigious Ross Volunteers Honor Guard, 
and a member of the Ross Volunteers 
Firing Squad. During his senior year, 
he served as Second Battalion Com-
mander.

February 13, 2020 
In 1969, Steve graduated from A&M 
with a bachelor of science degree in pe-
troleum engineering. He continued at 
A&M to earn a master’s degree in the 
same discipline. 
Steve began his career with Shell Oil 
Company in Houston, Texas. Much of 
his work over his 5 years at Shell was 
focused on designing and pumping 
large hydraulic fracture treatments to 
stimulate production from the deep, 
low permeability, geopressured gas res-
ervoirs in South Texas. 
It was his work with hydraulic frac-
turing that inspired him to return to 
Texas A&M and that set him apart 
from his peers as a true legend in the 
oil and gas industry for the advance-
ment of this critically important tech-
nology. 
One day in 1970, Steve was riding the 
elevator at work and met Ann Friddle, 
who was also working at Shell. Steve 
and Ann were married 6 months later, 
on January 9, 1971, and they had been 
married for over 48 years when he 
passed away. 
He and Ann returned to College Sta-
tion, and he pursued a Ph.D. in petro-
leum engineering, which he completed 
in 1975. In 1976, Steve joined the Texas 
A&M petroleum engineering faculty 
and, as if he didn’t have enough to do 
as a young father and as a new pro-
fessor, he started his own consulting 
company, S.A. Holditch & Associates. 
S.A. Holditch & Associates quickly 
became a worldwide powerhouse in the 
petroleum engineering space. Over the 
years, Steve earned a reputation for 
being able to solve the most difficult 
petroleum engineering problems, espe-
cially those dealing with low perme-
ability reservoirs needing stimulation, 
typically through hydraulic fracturing. 
He was distinctly proud of the work 
Holditch & Associates did alongside the 
Gas Research Institute to advance un-
derstanding of low permeability sand-
stones, shales, and coalbed methane. 
After over 20 years of success, Steve 
chose to sell Holditch & Associates to 
Schlumberger, where he stayed on as a 
fellow, the highest technical designa-
tion 
in 
that 
organization. 
As 
a 
Schlumberger fellow for 5 years, Steve 
traveled extensively to help solve some 
of the world’s most difficult petroleum 
engineering problems. 
In 1995, at age 49, Steve was elected 
to the National Academy of Engineer-
ing, the highest honor that can be 
given to an engineer. After many years 
of service to the Society of Petroleum 
Engineers, or the SPE, Steve was elect-
ed to the board of directors, then vice 
president of finance, and finally presi-
dent of this global organization with 
over 70,000 members. 
He was awarded almost every rec-
ognition that SPE has to give, includ-
ing three of the society’s top awards. 
He was elected as an SPE honorary 
member in 2006, the highest award that 
SPE can bestow upon an individual and 
was officially named a Legend of Hy-
draulic Fracturing by SPE in 2014. 
While Steve enjoyed many profes-
sional successes in the commercial re-
gime, many of his greatest accomplish-
ments were at Texas A&M University, 
where he served on the faculty for 37 
years. During his tenure, he taught 97 
courses and served on over 150 graduate 
committees. 
From 2004–2012, Steve worked as head 
of the Harold Vance Department of Pe-
troleum Engineering. During this time, 
he revitalized the Crisman Institute for 
Petroleum Research, and saw the num-
ber of students in the petroleum engi-
neering department more than double. 
Under his leadership, the department 
quickly earned a reputation as the 
number one ranked university petro-
leum engineering department in the 
world. 
It was during his time at Texas A&M 
that he created his second legacy for 
America’s hydrocarbon industry; the 
thousands of Aggie petroleum engi-
neers who work around the world every 
day utilizing Steve’s teaching and men-
toring to solve the world’s greatest en-
ergy challenges. Their work, alongside 
the work of other industry legends, 
like George P. Mitchell and Michel T. 
Halbouty, 
along 
with 
Stephen 
Holditch, 
have 
contributed 
signifi-
cantly to America’s energy dominance 
that is changing the world today. 
In 2013, Steve retired from the fac-
ulty after many years of dedicated 
service to the Texas A&M community. 
Throughout his life, Steve often cred-
ited Texas A&M University as the 
foundation from which his success 
grew. He praised the values instilled in 
all Aggies and, in 2014, was named a 
Texas A&M Distinguished Alumnus, an 
honor he richly deserved for a life of 
service and devotion to his beloved uni-
versity. 
In thanking the Aggie community, 
Steve said: ‘‘You will look back at your 
years at Texas A&M as one of the best 
periods in your life. Always remember 
the Aggie Code of Honor.’’ 
In 2016, Steve was inducted into the 
Corps of Cadets Hall of Honor, an 
award which made him prouder and 
happier than perhaps any award he had 
received in his life. 
While in retirement, Steve enjoyed 
spending time in Bryan-College Sta-
tion with his wife, Ann, their two 
daughters, 
and 
their 
five 
grand-
children. As a season ticket holder to a 
variety of Texas A&M sports, Steve 
continued to support the Aggies, but 
Fighting 
Texas 
Aggie 
football 
re-
mained closest to his heart. 
Steve contributed a great deal to the 
Texas A&M community, and can be de-
scribed as a model Texas Aggie, who 
was true to his core values of excel-
lence, integrity, leadership, loyalty, re-
spect, and selfless service. One of my 
favorite phrases that Steve often used 
was: ‘‘I reserve the right to get smart-
er.’’ That is what he did best, always 
pushing to find solutions to the world’s 
toughest oil and gas challenges. 
Madam Speaker, Steve’s life was de-
fined by his dedication to his family 
and his friends, his world-changing ac-
complishments in energy, and his true 
love of Texas A&M University. He will 
be forever remembered as a true pio-
neer in his field, a devoted husband, a 
father, a grandfather, a teacher, a men-
tor, and a friend. 
My father has a saying: ‘‘Go make a 
hand.’’ 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Steve 
Holditch 
truly ‘‘made a hand’’ for his family, his 
university, his community, our coun-
try, and our world. 
My wife, Gina, and I offer our deepest 
and 
heartfelt 
condolences 
to 
the 
Holditch family. We also lift up the 
family and friends of Steve Holditch in 
our prayers. 
I have requested that the United 
States flag be flown over our Nation’s 
Capitol to honor the life and legacy of 
Dr. Stephen A. Holditch. 
As I close, I would ask all Americans 
to continue praying for our country 
during these difficult times, for our 
military men and women who protect 
us from threats abroad, and for our 
first responders who keep us safe here 
at home. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

THE PENDING DEBT TSUNAMI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
as I get set up, in past years, when I 
used to have to sit up there, it was be-
cause the Speaker was annoyed with 
me. I am sure that would never happen 
in your case. You don’t have to say 
anything. 
Madam Speaker, I try to come to the 
floor every week and sort of talk about 
what we see actually happening in the 
economy, what is happening in jobs, 
and those things. But it is more of a 
global discussion. And part of that dis-
cussion is we see the stories, we know 
the facts; we are about to be buried in 
a debt tsunami. And it is not Repub-
licans and Democrats. It is demo-
graphics. 
There are 74 million of us who are 
baby boomers; 74 million. We are half-
way through turning 65, moving into 
our earned benefits. And it is such a 
difficult subject around here because, 
the fact of the matter is, as soon as you 
use the word Medicare or Social Secu-
rity in any type of discussion, even 
when you are passionately trying to 
protect those programs, in our modern 
politics of rage, you just wrote an at-
tack ad saying, well, he talked about 
Medicare; he must be meaning to do 
something. That is absurd. If we are 
not talking about it, we are not going 
to save them. 
Here is the thought experiment. Next 
5 years, just the growth of Social Secu-
rity, 
Medicare, 
healthcare 
entitle-
ments, but mostly Medicare, just the 
growth, equals the entire Defense De-
partment. 
Last week, I was here with some 
boards walking you through, showing

that almost all the 30-year debt, al-
most every dime of it, is just Social Se-
curity and Medicare. It is demo-
graphics. And my passion is, I believe 
there is a way we keep our promises, 
by using a calculator, by using, actu-
ally, economic modeling, using the 
tools we have around us. 
The problem is, in this body, it is 
complex. Our ability to do simple 
things the last year has been just in-
credibly heartbreaking because every-
thing is right now about political 
gamesmanship, one-upmanship, trying 
to get the lead, instead of dealing with 
the reality. It is complex. 
So I put up this slide almost every 
time I come speak, trying to make the 
point that if you can grow the economy 
through tax policy, through trade pol-
icy, through smart regulations, popu-
lation stability, getting the immigra-
tion system correct, family formation, 
the adoption of disruptive technology 
in healthcare—and we are going to talk 
about that a little bit today—incen-
tives to stay in the labor force. 
We are having a miracle right now, 
mathematically, of the number of our 
brothers and sisters who are in the 
labor force and moving into the labor 
force. 
Last Friday, the number of folks who 
moved from not even looking that en-
tered the labor force was stunning. I 
know that is geeky, but it is really, 
really, really important. 
I have sat on the Joint Economic 
Committee now for years, and it was 
only 3 or 4 years ago we would have 
these really smart economists come 
and tell us that labor force participa-
tion was going to crash; this type of 
full employment economy was impos-
sible. 
It is here. These types of wage gains, 
as you know, we just had to recal-
culate. 
The 
productivity 
numbers 
turned out to be much higher in 2019 
than we thought they were. 
How do we take what is working 
right now, expand those concepts so we 
hit a level of economic stability and 
growth that gives us a fighting chance 
not to be buried in debt? And how does 
that become partisan rage around 
here? 
I accept my brothers and sisters on 
the left live in an economic folklore of, 
well, we will tax rich people, and that 
will take care of it. And my brothers 
and sisters with me on the Republican 
side, we often will get behind micro-
phones and say things like, well, it is 
waste and fraud. None of those are 
true. 
Let’s just, for once, try to tell the 
truth about the math. The math is 
stunningly ugly. Simple concepts. 
And even last week, I think I brought 
this board here. If you take the next 30 
years, and you pull Social Security and 
Medicare out, that next 30 years—and I 
have a 4-year old; I would really like 
her to have the same type of future I 
got to experience in my life. But if I 
strip Social Security and Medicare out 
of the next 30 years, we have $23 tril-
lion in the bank. We are $23 trillion 
positive. Not inflation adjusted; that is 
the raw number. 
If I pull Social Security and Medicare 
back into that 30-year window, we are 
$103 trillion in debt. And if you want to 
do constant dollars removed, then drop 
the number by a third. 
b 1300 
You cannot be intellectually cred-
ible, 
honest 
walking 
behind 
these 
microphones saying you are going to 
protect Social Security, you are going 
to protect Medicare, and then not be 
willing to talk about the actual math. 
Because I think there is a way that we 
keep our promises; it just means we 
have to do everything. 
So one of the first things I want to 
walk through today is a concept, and I 
am desperately trying to sell and have 
this sort of become intellectually sort 
of socialized. 
The ACA, ObamaCare, if you really 
strip it down, what was it? It was a fi-
nancing bill. Take it down to its most 
basic. This is hard for a lot of us to ac-
cept, but it was who got subsidized and 
who had to pay. 
Our Republican alternative, if you 
really strip it down, what was it? It 
was a financing bill. It is who got to 
pay and who got subsidized. 
We almost never have an honest ar-
gument around here of what to do to 
crash the price of healthcare. We have 
lots of discussions of little incremental 
changes, and all those incremental 
changes are important, whether it be 
HSAs, whether it be disclosures of cost 
and these things. Wonderful. But they 
are dishonest when you start to under-
stand the scale—the scale—of what is 
coming at us. 
Back to that 5 years; make it 10 
years. Just the growth of Social Secu-
rity, mostly Medicare, healthcare enti-
tlements, equals the entire discre-
tionary budget. Just the growth por-
tion. 
So what do you do to disrupt the cost 
of healthcare? And my argument is we 
need to legalize technology. 
I am not going to show it today, but 
in the past, I have come here and 
shown that we now have the tech-
nology; it is in its final stages of hope-
fully being perfected. It looks like a 
big kazoo. You blow into it and it in-
stantly tells you you have the flu. It 
instantly could bang off your medical 
records on your phone, instantly order 
your antivirals. 
The algorithm we know right now is 
incredibly accurate, except that tech-
nology is illegal in today’s conscript. 
Think of that. 
So how do you disrupt healthcare 
prices? Well, one, I am going to take us 
to something a little bit different. 
Did you know that almost a half a 
trillion a year—actually, over half a 
trillion a year, 16 percent of our entire 
healthcare cost, is just people not fol-
lowing the rules for their pharma-
ceuticals. They don’t take their hyper-
tension medicine. They take too much 
of this. They don’t take this. That is an 
adherence problem. 
Sixteen 
percent 
of 
our 
entire 
healthcare cost is the failure to follow 
your pharmaceutical protocols. That is 
not drug pricing; that is not prescrip-
tion pricing; that is not a PBM; that is 
not a benefit. That is just you and I, as 
Americans, we are not following the 
rules for the pharmaceuticals we have. 
Well, it turns out the fastest thing 
you and I could do to actually have an 
immediate pop-down on the price of 
healthcare is actually change pharma-
ceutical adherence. 
Well, it turns out we have technology 
for that, and here is the thought exper-
iment. We have pill bottle tops that 
tell you when you open it up or if you 
didn’t open it up, and it will ping you. 
So we know right now the adherence 
of taking your hypertension medicine 
is one of the most powerful things we 
can do to actually crash the price of 
healthcare, but you have got to take it. 
How many of us forget? 
Well, the fact of the matter is, for a 
few dollars, we could issue that pill 
bottle with a cap that starts pinging 
your 
phone, 
pinging 
your 
family, 
pinging whoever the hell you want to 
ping that you didn’t follow the rules. 
We have actually brought the display 
here before. It looks like a little dome. 
It actually distributes pharmaceuticals 
into a cup. 
So, if you are my grandmother, rest 
her soul, and you have a couple pills 
you take in the morning, one for diges-
tion at lunch, and a couple before you 
go to bed, it actually will distribute 
those at the proper time, in the proper 
amounts, and then tell you, reminds 
you, reminds the family if that little 
cup with the pharmaceuticals hasn’t 
been touched. 
It turns out it is a technology solu-
tion, and it is a half-a-trillion-a-year 
issue. Yeah, it is a little hard to ex-
plain, but 16 percent of our healthcare 
cost is just not taking our pharma-
ceuticals properly. 
Is this Republican or Democrat? It is 
just what we are. And the fact of the 
matter is a bunch of really creative en-
trepreneurs, these small, disruptive 
tech companies, are coming up with a 
solution. 
How do we make that part of what we 
are trying to move forward? How do 
you make it reimbursable? How do you 
actually take Medicare part D and say, 
instead of the rules right now where 
someone is supposed to be trying to 
call, actually, widen up that definition 
so they could also be providing the 
technology to make sure someone is 
taking those pharmaceuticals in the 
proper fashion? 
I am begging this place to open up 
our minds and think a bit more cre-
atively about what do we do to disrupt 
the price of healthcare, because, re-
member, that 30-year debt curve, it is 
mostly healthcare. And, guess what. 
Technology is about to help us disrupt 
it if we could just make that tech-
nology legal, reimbursable, part of our 
plan. We can do some amazing things.

And, actually, in this hyperpartisan 
environment, this technology hasn’t 
been made Republican or Democrat 
yet. I am sure we will find a way. What 
will happen is one of the corporate ex-
ecutives will write someone a check, 
and we will decide they are all left and 
right, and we will beat the crap out of 
each other, but right now, this is an ac-
tual solution. 
There are other really amazing dis-
ruptions coming, and I think this one 
may have been shown at the consumer 
electronics show. I am not even sure I 
understand all the things it does, but 
this, in many ways, is a doctor visit in 
your pocket. It does about a dozen dif-
ferent things where it can actually do 
a number of different tests, and it is in 
your medicine cabinet. 
How do we encourage this type of 
technology? Because, day after day, we 
will have individuals coming to us and 
saying: We have a crisis in the United 
States. We don’t have enough primary 
care physicians. 
They are absolutely right. 
So, how do we help those primary 
care professionals? By saying we can 
have some technology where it is the 
type of thing where you can blow into 
it, you can prick your finger, or it can 
do this, this, this, this, and it is incred-
ibly accurate. And it is available to 
you instantly because it is in your own 
home medicine cabinet. 
Let me give you one. What would 
happen if you could have a major, high-
ly accurate disease detention tech-
nology, and it doesn’t have to be in 
your medicine cabinet, but it could be 
at your local CVS Pharmacy? It turns 
out this technology looks like it has 
been perfected. 
Your lungs throw off—forgive me, I 
am going to try to get my technology 
right. Your lungs actually become part 
of your body that your blood circulates 
completely through, I think, every cou-
ple minutes. Your breath actually has 
thrown off proteins and other things 
that can be detected. 
I showed this a couple months ago. 
Some researchers, I think, are actually 
working on it, an extension of that flu 
kazoo that can pick up 20 different 
types of dead cancer proteins and let 
you know you have them. 
Well, it turns out this technology, 
actually, now exists today, and the 
ability of it to actually look for dozens 
of different types of ailments, a num-
ber of different types of cancers. What 
you do is you just breathe into it for a 
couple minutes. 
Why aren’t we running as fast as we 
can to make this part of our commu-
nity? 
We talk about access to care. The 
fact of the matter is that supercom-
puter you hold in your pocket you call 
your phone, its algorithm, tied in with 
these types of sensors, whether it be 
the oxygen sensor I played with last 
year—I am a severe asthmatic, and we 
just played with it, and it was helping 
me dial up and, for the most part, dial 
down my inhaled steroids. Now, tech-
nically, it was illegal because it is pre-
scribing to me, and it hadn’t been ap-
proved. 
From that flu kazoo I just described 
to you that is unreimbursable and, ul-
timately, illegal because the algorithm 
is writing a prescription to something 
like this that can do a stunning num-
ber of diagnostics if you are just will-
ing to breathe into it for 10 minutes, 
the miracle is here. 
Is this Republican or Democrat? It is 
neither. It is the future. But, in so 
many ways, Congress has become the 
barrier, stopping, holding back the 
technology disruptions that actually 
could help us crash the price. And, in-
stead, we seem so much more com-
fortable having debates about, ‘‘Well, 
who should get subsidized?’’ ‘‘Who 
should we finance?’’ ‘‘Who should be 
regulated?’’ 
‘‘Who 
should 
be 
con-
trolled?’’ instead of, ‘‘Let’s set people 
free.’’ 
We have technology that can help 
you manage yourself, know what is 
going on, detect blood cancers through 
breathing. Why aren’t we running as 
fast as we can to get these things to 
market 
to 
disrupt 
the 
price 
of 
healthcare? 
And, look, it is not a complex 
premise. We can make the economy 
grow like crazy. We have seen the ex-
pansive effects of the tax reform and 
some of the regulatory reforms. We 
have to get the immigration system 
correct, moving more to a talent-based 
system. We have to do the incentives 
for labor force participation. There is a 
whole bunch of things we need to do, 
and we just know the economics there. 
The hardest part is, as a society, 
none of that is going to matter unless 
we have a disruption in the price curve 
of healthcare delivery. And I am going 
to argue there is a path, and it is here. 
Can I give you sort of a thought ex-
periment? Should Congress have slowed 
down the internet a decade ago to pro-
tect Blockbuster Video? 
Think about it. If Blockbuster Video 
had gone out and hired an army of lob-
byists walking around the hallways 
here, Congress is somewhat in the pro-
tection bracket, should we have slowed 
down the internet to keep that Netflix 
from putting them out of business? 
Of course not. That is absurd, isn’t 
it? Yet Congress does that with all 
sorts of rules, whether it be reimburse-
ment, the cynicism toward algorithmic 
health and sensors and these things 
that can help our medical community, 
because we will often get certain lobby 
groups and others who will come in the 
door and say: This will be really dis-
ruptive to our business model. Can you 
slow it down? 
And every day we slow these things 
down, you are crushing my little girl’s 
future, but you are also crushing the 
rest of this country because the debt 
curve is crashing down on us if you ac-
tually look at the debt that is going to 
come out this year. 
There was a 4-month report from 
Treasury yesterday that basically said, 
hey, receipts—and I am blessed to be 
on the Ways and Means Committee— 
receipts. We don’t call them, actually, 
revenues, but receipts and tax are real-
ly healthy. 
Last year, we grew over 4 percent, 
but we spent over 8 percent, and then 
we will beat up each other, saying: 
‘‘Well, you wanted to expand this pro-
gram,’’ or, ‘‘You wanted to expand that 
program.’’ 
The fact of the matter is the expan-
sion defense, the expansion of other 
programs is a fraction of that growth. 
Almost all that growth in spending is 
demographics. It is the reality. Those 
of us who are baby boomers are moving 
into our earned benefits and we never 
set aside the money for it, so, if you 
can keep the promises. 
Are you willing to do the combina-
tion of things—and you have got to do 
them all because, it turns out, if you 
do the labor participation incentives to 
enter and stay and get involved in the 
labor force, to do that well, you actu-
ally need to be doing things over here 
in technology that make it available 
for those who may have certain bar-
riers. 
Over here, for certain people with 
barriers, you have to have regulations 
that actually work rationally with our 
brothers and sisters who may have 
those barriers. It all has to come to-
gether. 
Can Congress do something that is 
complex, because it turns out there is 
no simple solution. There is a complex 
one, and there is a path. 
And 
the 
scary 
part—understand, 
when we do the math, and this is some-
thing I have been doing for a couple 
years, we still think we hit about 95 
percent of debt to GDP. My goal is just 
to hold us there and not blow through 
that. It is possible. Can Congress be-
come creative? 
So the next one I want to go through, 
and this is actually sort of fun for me. 
This is actually one of my older dis-
plays. It is from a year or so ago, be-
cause I have this fascination with 
something they call carbon capture. 
So a couple years ago, they finally 
built an electric facility outside Texas, 
La Porte, Texas, wherever that is. I am 
sure it is a lovely place. But imagine— 
and there are two of them. There is a 
natural gas and a coal-fired power 
plant, and they don’t have smoke-
stacks. 
On the natural gas one, they came up 
with this crazy idea. I think it is called 
the Allam cycle. You blow up the nat-
ural gas, and you actually use the car-
bon, the burnt, and slam that through 
the turbines, and then at the other 
side, you cool it and capture it. 
b 1315 
You go, oh, God, we haven’t been 
doing that? 
We, last year, in the Ways and Means 
Committee, perfected, and now we are 
going to try to do it more, something 
they call 45Q, which is the incentive to 
capture and then, over here, to seques-
ter that CO2. Great.

You get some of those who are cyn-
ical saying, well, it can’t work, or it is 
going to be too expensive. We are going 
to have a little fun with the ‘‘too ex-
pensive.’’ 
The best technology we had last year 
was a facility, I believe, that is going 
up in Canada. The Gates Foundation 
and others are investing in it. Their 
best number was about $100 a ton. It is 
$100 a ton for substantially pure car-
bon. 
Everybody who geeks out on carbon 
change and those things, you know you 
can do lots of things with it. You can, 
through a chemical process, turn it 
back into clean-burning fuel. You can 
do what they do in Texas and other 
places, which is to pump it in the 
ground and use it for enhanced oil re-
covery. But $100 a ton was sort of our 
best bet. 
I beg of you, if you are someone who 
is interested in the technology of car-
bon capture, I want you to go grab 
your phone and look up the news sto-
ries from last October. I want you to 
put this into your search engine: MIT 
ambient carbon capture. 
Some researchers at MIT last year 
had 
just 
this 
wonderfully 
elegant 
breakthrough. They have a really nice 
video, if you are not particularly tech-
nical, sort of showing how they did 
nanotubes and electric plates, where 
they can power them up, power them 
down, power them up, power them 
down. They can do this in an ambient 
environment, so on the roof of your 
home or on top of a smokestack. 
In part of the articles, if I am reading 
it properly, it wasn’t $100 or $150 a ton. 
It is down to $50 a ton. Their model 
says it is down to $50 a ton. You do re-
alize that is almost the market price 
today? 
It turns out, if you are someone who 
cares about the issue of CO2 in the en-
vironment, we have just had a major 
breakthrough. And how much discus-
sion does it get? This has been since 
October. How much joy have you seen 
in newspapers and articles, talking 
about a revolutionary breakthrough? 
And we can be doing mining, because 
we have to deal with this reality. 
The United States has gotten dra-
matically cleaner in the last 15 years. 
Good. But a whole bunch of the rest of 
the world hasn’t. Unless we are arro-
gant enough that we think we are 
going to turn around carbon-use poli-
cies in a bunch of the rest of the world, 
we are out of our minds. 
It turns out we can grow our econ-
omy; we can continue to use hydro-
carbons; and we have a technology that 
not only would mine our own CO2 but 
would help us on everything else that 
is being generated in other places in 
the world. 
I am going to digress for just a sec-
ond. This isn’t that same sort of 
theme. I have come here behind the 
microphone before and talked about 
plastic in the ocean. 
Before I got this crazy job, I used to 
love to scuba dive, and we talk all the 
time about plastic in the ocean. Here 
in Washington, D.C., we do lots of vir-
tue signaling. We made paper straws. 
Of course, how much U.S. and North 
American plastic actually ends up in 
the ocean? Substantially none. Ninety 
percent of the plastic in the ocean 
comes from 10 rivers, 8 in Asia, 2 in Af-
rica. 
If you cared about plastic in the 
ocean, you would go to the 10 rivers 
that are 90 percent of the plastic—8 in 
Asia, 2 in Africa—and you would do 
something. You would create a value 
for the plastic. 
As Republicans, we are trying to do 
that. But it blows up some of the folk-
lore around here of, well, if we do paper 
straws in Washington, D.C., we make 
an effect. Come on. 
Look, I understand we live in a world 
where everything is political, and the 
virtue signaling makes us feel better. 
Wouldn’t you really prefer to do some-
thing that makes a difference? 
Back to this concept, a major break-
through in how you capture carbon, 
you can do it right out of the air. Now, 
that is one of the amazing things in 
this article. It works in ambient air. It 
doesn’t have to be on top of a smoke-
stack. 
A couple of days ago, there is an arti-
cle—one of my personal fascinations, 
as those of you who claim to pay atten-
tion to this know, is the math on meth-
ane. As you all know, a couple of years 
ago, we had to recalculate methane’s 
half-life, so a lot of the old formulas 
were all wrong. Now, we think methane 
is about 9 years. But the accepted ratio 
right now is 1 ton of methane equals 84 
tons of carbon. 
Okay, so the picture alongside me, 
because it was the best picture I had, is 
a flare in remote Texas. They are doing 
their best to burn off that methane. 
Someone just came up with the idea: 
Why don’t we just back up a truck, 
chill it, super-chill it like we do with 
liquefied gas? We get a valuable com-
modity, and we capture all of it. And 
remember the ratio 84-to-1? Well, we 
incentivize this. 
We are already doing the 45Q to cre-
ate a tax incentive to capture carbon 
and sequester it or use it in some other 
things. Wouldn’t it make sense to do 
that same sort of model with methane? 
We came behind these mikes a year 
or 2 ago and showed just the math pos-
sibility that a major pipeline to cap-
ture methane from oil country, just 
that single pipeline functioning, it got 
you just to the Paris accords, slightly 
below. 
The blowback I got was crazy. ‘‘Oh, I 
don’t like pipelines.’’ You are saying: 
‘‘But did you see the math that just 
this 
one 
thing 
actually 
had 
this 
huge’’—‘‘but I don’t like pipelines.’’ We 
need to stop dealing in absurdity. 
It turns out, we may be able to do it 
without the pipeline. Now it is a truck, 
backing up, chilling it, capturing it. 
We need to understand things like this. 
If a portable LNG truck capturing the 
methane is a solution, is that Repub-
lican or Democrat? 
Well, in this environment right now, 
maybe it is Republican, because some 
of my brothers and sisters on the left 
hate these technologies. Sorry, that is 
unfair. A number of them are skeptical 
of technologies that allow us to keep 
using hydrocarbons. 
My argument is, embrace, love the 
science, love the technology. It will set 
you free. Because these things make a 
difference. 
We live in the time of miracles, 
whether it be healthcare technology or 
whether it be the single-shot cure for 
hemophilia. You all saw the article a 
couple of days ago that we think we 
might also have a cure for hemophilia, 
not only A, but B also. 
The cures, whether it be for curing 
people in the chronic population, tech-
nology for our environment, or tech-
nology to crash the price of healthcare, 
they are here. 
You know, one of the biggest barriers 
to the disruption that could help us 
continue to grow the economy, could 
help us have enough robustness in that 
economy so we can keep our promises 
and at the same time get a cleaner en-
vironment and healthier economy is 
this body and its inability to stop the 
arrogance and thinking that we are so 
smart, that we think we know what to-
morrow’s technology is. 
When I first got elected, we had a 
family joke. ‘‘When are the two times 
in life you think you know every-
thing?’’ ‘‘When you are 13 years old and 
the day after you get elected to Con-
gress.’’ And the family would laugh and 
then make fun of me. 
Now that I have been here a few 
years, I worry. We have lots of good 
people, lots of really smart people. And 
all day long, we are pounded by folks 
who are trying to protect their busi-
ness models or their bureaucracy mod-
els. 
I am begging us, we need to under-
stand the tsunami of debt that is on 
the horizon, and it turns out, tech-
nology is about to provide us solutions 
that don’t bankrupt us and actually 
provide the solution and don’t put gov-
ernment in charge of every aspect of 
our lives. 
This should be a story of incredible 
hope and excitement. But can we break 
through the politics of arrogance that 
we have around here and start being 
willing to push the envelope of the ac-
tual solutions? 
Madam Speaker, thank you for toler-
ating me. I appreciate it. I yield back 
the balance of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The majority leader is rec-

TRIBUTE TO BOB SWANNER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, ear-
lier this week, I offered thanks to a 
long list of Senate officers and staff 
who helped this body fulfill our unique 
constitutional responsibilities in re-
cent weeks, but we are soon saying 
goodbye to one of those distinguished 
servants of the U.S. Senate. So I would 
like to begin this morning by sharing 
my gratitude and the whole Senate’s 
gratitude for Bob Swanner. 
Bob first joined the staff of the Sen-
ate Recording Studio more than two 
decades ago. Back then, he was already 
somewhat of an expert in designing and 
constructing television and radio stu-
dios. In fact, I understand that his 
record was so impressive that he was 
offered the job on the spot, and as any-
one knows who has worked with Bob 
for even a few minutes, he has spent 
every day since then demonstrating 
how lucky we were to have him on 
board. 
By his second year on the job, Bob 
had already successfully spearheaded 
the transition of Senate broadcasts to 
high-definition TV, and he didn’t stop 
there. Over the past two decades, Bob 
has guided the overhaul of the camera 
and audio systems in every Senate 
hearing room. He masterminded the de-
sign of the new Senate Recording Stu-
dio’s facilities in the Capitol Visitor 
Center, and he has made sure that 
speeches here on the floor are delivered 
under only the best TV lighting. 
Let’s face it—Hollywood, this place is 
not. Frankly, capturing a U.S. Sen-
ator’s ‘‘good side’’ is not always an 
easy assignment, but as Bob knows 
better than anyone, our audio-visual 
capabilities in this institution are not 
about glamor; they are about civics. 
They are about making sure the Amer-
ican people can look and listen to their 
government.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1052 
February 13, 2020 
Oh, and I haven’t even gotten to the 
small fact that Presidential inaugura-
tions take place here on the Capitol 
grounds as well. Not long after Bob was 
promoted to general manager of the 
Recording Studio came the 2017 inau-
guration—one big professional chal-
lenge after another and one success 
after another on behalf of the institu-
tion that Bob has served. 
It is no surprise that Bob’s colleagues 
at the Recording Studio are sorry to 
see him go. The Senate is better for his 
dedicated efforts over these many 
years, but he will begin his well-de-
served retirement with our sincere 
thanks for a job well done. 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. President, now on an entirely dif-
ferent matter, it has been 1 week since 
the Senate concluded the third Presi-
dential trial in American history. 
Things move quickly in Washington, 
as always, so it is natural that our 
focus is now shifting to the many pol-
icy subjects where we have more work 
to do for families all across our coun-
try. 
But when the Senate acts, we do not 
only address the particular issue before 
us; we create lasting precedent. This is 
especially true during something as 
grave and uncommon as an impeach-
ment trial. Just as citizens, scholars, 
and Senators ourselves studied the past 
precedents of 1868 and 1999, so will fu-
ture generations examine what un-
folded over the past few months. 
So before we adjourn for the upcom-
ing State work period and leave im-
peachment fully in the rearview mir-
ror, I wanted to speak about it one 
more time—not about the particulars 
that have been so exhaustively dis-
cussed and debated but the deeper 
questions, to record some final obser-
vations for the future. 
The Senate did its job. We protected 
the long-term future of our Republic. 
We kept the temporary fires of fac-
tionalism from burning through to the 
bedrock of our institutions. We acted 
as Madison wished—as an ‘‘impedi-
ment’’ against ‘‘improper acts.’’ The 
Framers’ firewall held the line. 
But in this case, all is not well that 
ends well. We cannot forget the abuses 
that fueled this process. We cannot 
make light of the dangerous new prece-
dents set by President Trump’s oppo-
nents in their zeal to impeach at all 
costs. We need to remember what hap-
pened so we can avoid it ever hap-
pening again. 
As we know, the leftwing drive to im-
peach President Trump predated—pre-
dated—any phone call to Ukraine—and, 
in fact, his inauguration. This isn’t a 
Republican talking point; it is what 
was reported by outlets like POLITICO 
and the Washington Post. House Demo-
crats barely tried to hide that they 
began with a guilty verdict and were 
simply shopping for a suitable crime. 
So, unfortunately, it was predictable 
that the House majority would use the 
serious process of impeachment as a 
platform to politically attack the 
President. It was less predictable that 
they would also attack our Nation’s 
core institutions themselves. But that 
is what happened. 
First, the House Democrats chose to 
degrade their body’s own precedents. 
The 
majority 
sprinted 
through 
a 
slapdash investigation to meet arbi-
trary 
political 
deadlines. 
They 
trivialized the role of the House Judici-
ary Committee, the body traditionally 
charged with conducting impeachment 
inquiries. They sidelined their own Re-
publican minority colleagues and the 
President’s counsel to precedent-break-
ing degrees. 
All of this was very regrettable, but 
from a purely practical perspective, 
breaking the House’s own china was 
Speaker PELOSI’s prerogative. What 
was truly outrageous is what came 
next—a rolling attack on the other in-
stitutions outside the House. 
To begin with, the recklessly broad 
Articles of Impeachment were an at-
tack not just on one President but on 
the Office of the Presidency itself. 
Their first article criticized the al-
leged motivation behind a Presidential 
action but failed to frame their com-
plaint as definable ‘‘high Crimes [or] 
Misdemeanors.’’ This House set out 
into unchartered constitutional waters 
by passing the first-ever Presidential 
impeachment that did not allege any 
violations of criminal statutes. 
Clearly, they owed the Senate and 
the country a clear limiting principle 
to explain why removal on these 
grounds would be different from the 
malleable and subjective ‘‘maladmin-
istration’’ standard, which the Framers 
rejected as a ground for impeachment. 
But they offered no such thing. 
And their second article sought to 
criminalize the normal and routine ex-
ercise of executive privileges that 
Presidents of both parties have rightly 
invoked throughout our history. This 
was, in effect, criminalizing the separa-
tion of powers themselves. 
So the House articles would have 
sharply diminished the Presidency in 
our constitutional structure. To ex-
tract a pound of flesh from one par-
ticular President, House Democrats 
were willing to attack the office itself. 
But it did not stop with the House 
and the Presidency. Next in the cross-
hairs came the Senate. 
The very night the House passed the 
articles, the Speaker began an unprece-
dented effort to reach outside her own 
Chamber and dictate the contours of 
the Senate trial to Senators. The bi-
zarre stunt of withholding the articles 
achieved, of course, nothing, but the 
irony was enormous. 
The House had just spent weeks jeal-
ously guarding their ‘‘sole power’’ of 
impeachment 
and 
criticizing 
other 
branches for perceived interference. In-
deed, this reasoning was the entire 
basis for their second Article of Im-
peachment, but their first act out of 
the gate was to try to bust constitu-
tional guardrails and meddle in the 
Senate. 
When that stunt went nowhere and 
the 
trial 
began, 
House 
Democrats 
brought their war on institutions over 
to this Chamber. From the very first 
evening, it was clear the House man-
agers would not even try to persuade a 
supermajority of Senators but simply 
sought to degrade and smear the Sen-
ate itself before the Nation. Senators 
were called ‘‘treacherous’’ for not 
structuring our proceedings to the 
managers’ liking. 
Finally, when the trial neared its end 
and it became clear that bullying the 
Senate would not substitute for per-
suading it, the campaign against insti-
tutions took aim at yet another inde-
pendent branch—the Supreme Court— 
in particular, the Chief Justice of the 
United States. 
A far-left pressure group produced 
ads impugning him for presiding neu-
trally—neutrally—and not seizing con-
trol of the Senate. One Democratic 
Senator running for President made 
the Chief Justice read a pointless ques-
tion gainsaying his own ‘‘legitimacy.’’ 
So, in summary, the opponents of 
this President were willing to throw 
mud at the House, the Presidency, the 
Senate, and the Supreme Court—all for 
the sake of short-term partisan poli-
tics. 
The irony would be rich if it were 
less sad. For years, this President’s op-
ponents have sought to cloak their 
rage in the high-minded trappings of 
institutionalism. The President’s oppo-
nents profess great concern for the 
norms and traditions of our govern-
ment. But when it really counted— 
when the rubber met the road—that 
talk proved cheap. It was they who 
proved willing to degrade public con-
fidence in our government. It was they 
who indulged political bloodlust at the 
expense of our institutions: reckless— 
reckless—insinuations that our 2016 
election was not legitimate; further in-
sinuations—right here on the floor— 
that if the American people reelect this 
President in 2020, the result will be pre-
sumptively illegitimate as well; bizarre 
statements from the Speaker of the 
House that she may simply deny re-
ality and refuse to accept the Senate’s 
verdict as final. 
There has been much discussion 
about the foreign adversaries who seek 
to reduce the American people’s faith 
in our democracy and cause chaos and 
division in our country—rightly so— 
but we must also demand that our own 
political leaders exercise some self-re-
straint and not do the work of our ad-
versaries for them. 
The critics of our Constitution often 
say that because our Framers could 
not have imagined modern conditions, 
their work is outmoded. We hear that 
the First Amendment or the Second 
Amendment or the separation of pow-
ers must be changed to suit the times. 
But the geniuses who founded this 
Nation were actually very prescient. 
Case in point: The reckless partisan 
crusade of recent weeks is something 
they predicted more than two centuries

ago. Hamilton predicted ‘‘the demon of 
faction will, at certain seasons, extend 
his scepter’’ over the House of Rep-
resentatives. He predicted that par-
tisan anger could produce ‘‘an intem-
perate or designing majority in the 
House of Representatives,’’ capable of 
destroying the separation of powers if 
left unchecked. 
The Framers predicted overheated 
House majorities might lash out at 
their peer institutions and display 
‘‘strong symptoms of impatience and 
disgust at the least sign of opposition 
from any other quarter; as if the exer-
cise of . . . rights, by either the execu-
tive or judiciary, were a breach of their 
privilege and an outrage to their dig-
nity.’’ They knew the popular legisla-
ture might be ‘‘disposed to exert an im-
perious control over the other depart-
ments.’’ 
They predicted all of this. They pre-
dicted it all. 
So they did something about it. They 
set up a firewall. They built the Sen-
ate. 
This body performed admirably these 
past weeks. We did precisely the job we 
were made for. 
We did precisely the job we were 
made for, but impeachment should 
never have come to the Senate like 
this. This most serious constitutional 
tool should never have been used so 
lightly—as a political weapon of first 
resort, as a tool to lash out at the basic 
bedrock of our institutions because one 
side did not get their way. 
It should never have happened, and it 
should never happen again. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
MARCH FOR LIFE 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, on 
January 24, tens of thousands of pro- 
life Americans filled the streets of 
Washington, DC, for the annual March 
for Life. Unfortunately, I couldn’t 
come down to the floor to talk about 
the march because the Senate was tied 
up with the impeachment trial, al-
though I did get the opportunity to 
meet with some marchers from Rapid 
City, SD. Now that the floor is open 
again, I wanted to come down to recog-
nize this year’s marchers, including 
those from my home State of South 
Dakota, and talk about why they 
march. 
Every year in this country, hundreds 
of thousands of babies are killed by 
abortion—hundreds of thousands. That 
is not some number the pro-life move-
ment has cooked up. That is straight 
from the pro-abortion Guttmacher In-
stitute, 
formerly 
affiliated 
with 
Planned Parenthood, which reports 
that ‘‘approximately 862,320 abortions 
were performed in 2017.’’ That is 862,320. 
Most of us can’t even fathom what a 
number that big looks like, but that is 
a lot of babies, because, of course, that 
is what we are talking about—babies, 
human beings. 
Proponents of abortion try to deny 
the humanity of the unborn child, but 
science and ultrasound and common 
sense all make it very clear that when 
we talk about unborn children, we are 
talking about human beings, with their 
own fingerprints and their own DNA. 
Human beings deserve to be protected, 
even when they are small and weak and 
vulnerable—especially when they are 
small and weak and vulnerable. 
Stick around politics long enough 
and you are sure to hear someone talk-
ing about the importance of being on 
the right side of history. It is a com-
mon trope, but it is no less true for 
that. The truth is, we should think 
about being on the right side of his-
tory. When people look back at us, we 
want to be remembered for standing up 
for what is right, not for going along 
with injustice. 
Abortion repeats a tired pattern. One 
group of people or society decides that 
another group of people is less valu-
able. They advance plausible-sounding 
reasons why it is legitimate to deprive 
these people of their human rights, and 
for various reasons people in that soci-
ety go along with it. It is a story that 
has been repeated too many times, and 
the judgment of history never looks 
kindly on these societies. 
The United States was founded to 
safeguard human rights. We haven’t al-
ways lived up to that promise, but we 
have never stopped trying. It is time 
for America to start standing up for 
the rights of unborn humans. 
Last week, in his State of the Union 
Address, the President called for a ban 
on late-term abortions. In 2016, some-
where around 11,000 babies were abort-
ed at or after the 21-week mark in 
pregnancy—11,000 in 1 year. That is a 
lot of babies. 
As neonatal science advances, we 
have been able to save babies born at 
earlier and earlier stages of pregnancy. 
Babies have survived after being born 
at 25 weeks, at 24 weeks, at 23 weeks, 
and, like Ellie Schneider, who attended 
the State of the Union Address with 
her mom, at 21 weeks. Yet, in this 
country it is legal to kill babies at 40 
weeks, right up until the very last mo-
ment of pregnancy. That makes no 
sense. 
How can a child born at 23 weeks be 
regarded as a human being, deserving 
of care, and yet an unborn child who is 
that very same age be regarded as less 
than human? The moment of birth does 
not magically confer humanity, and 
yet our law acts like it does. 
I would like to think that a bill to 
ban late-term abortions like the Presi-
dent proposed would be a no-brainer in 
Congress. At the very, very least, we 
should all be able to agree that we 
shouldn’t be aborting babies who can 
live outside their mothers. But, unfor-
tunately, 
abortion 
extremism 
has 
grown to such an extent that leading 
Democrats, including a Democrat Pres-
idential candidate, not only rule out 
banning late-term abortions, but they 
actually refused to rule out infanticide. 
Last year, after the Democrat Gov-
ernor of Virginia implicitly endorsed 
infanticide, the Senate took up legisla-
tion that simply stated that a baby 
born alive in an abortion clinic is enti-
tled to the same protection and med-
ical care that a baby born in a hospital 
is entitled to, and 44 Democrats, al-
most the entire Democrat caucus here 
in the Senate, voted against that legis-
lation. It was a grim day for human de-
cency and for human rights. 
Although we have a long way to go to 
protect unborn babies in this country, I 
remain hopeful, and I am never more 
hopeful than when I see tens of thou-
sands of Americans—so many of them 
young people—descend on our Nation’s 
Capital every year to march for life. 
We may not win this battle today or 
tomorrow, but we are turning the tide. 
The arc of the moral universe is long, 
but I believe that it does bend toward 
justice and in the end right will pre-
vail. I look forward to the day when 
every child born and unborn is pro-
tected in this country. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today the Senate will vote on a bipar-
tisan War Powers Resolution offered by 
Senator KAINE directing the President 
to terminate the use of U.S. Armed 
Forces for hostilities against the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran. 
The Constitution is clear: Congress 
has the power to declare war. The 
President has no authority to enter the 
United States into another endless con-
flict in the Middle East, but I fear that 
the President’s erratic decision-mak-
ing, his lack of strategy, his inability 
to control his impulses may bumble us 
into a war nonetheless, even if he 
doesn’t intend it. 
With this bipartisan resolution, the 
Senate will assert its constitutional 
authority and send a clear bipartisan 
message that the President—this Presi-
dent or any President—cannot sidestep 
Congress when it comes to matters of 
war and peace. It is important to do 
this now. 
The President’s actions in the Middle 
East have escalated the confrontation. 
Before the State of the Union, the 
President himself said that war with 
Iran was ‘‘closer than you thought’’—

his words. Now, let me be clear, nobody 
in this Chamber will shed a single tear 
over the death of Iranian General 
Soleimani, but that doesn’t mean that 
we 
disregard 
the 
potential 
con-
sequences of the strike or any com-
parable action. It is more than appro-
priate for Congress to affirm that it 
has authority over any major long- 
term hostilities with Iran, as the Con-
stitution prescribes. 
Yet, still, some on the other side 
have claimed that this War Powers 
Resolution is nothing more than an at-
tempt by Democrats to embarrass 
President Trump. The Founding Fa-
thers would laugh at that assertion. 
One of the great powers they gave Con-
gress—not 
the 
executive—was 
the 
power to declare war. This resolution is 
partisan? Well, then, why are a good 
number of Republicans supporting it? 
Let me say this again. This resolu-
tion is going to pass with a bipartisan 
majority of Senators in support—a rar-
ity these days. If this is purely an at-
tempt to embarrass the President, 
well, it is going to be a bipartisan one. 
We need to stop pretending as if both 
sides of the aisle aren’t concerned 
about the President having too much 
leeway over matters of war and peace. 
That is why this resolution is bipar-
tisan, because both sides of the aisle 
agree that for too long Congress has 
ceded our constitutional authority to 
the executive branch, and we are tak-
ing an important step today to claim 
that authority back. 
Now, today there will be amendments 
offered that will seek to do one thing 
and one thing only: undermine what we 
are trying to achieve today and provide 
the President’s lawyers with get-out- 
of-jail free cards. My colleague from 
Arkansas has an amendment that will 
create an exception for operations 
against foreign terrorist organizations. 
It sounds reasonable at first, but any 
enterprising lawyer in the administra-
tion could use this amendment to jus-
tify the type of unilateral escalation of 
hostilities that this legislation would 
prohibit. My colleague from Florida 
has an amendment that seeks a similar 
outcome. My friends on both sides who 
wish this resolution to pass should vote 
down these amendments. They cut 
against the core of the legislation. Sen-
ator KAINE told me that if this amend-
ment passed, the Cotton amendment, 
he would be forced to vote against his 
own bill. What good would that do for 
those of us who want to pass it any-
way? 
One final point. With respect to the 
situation in Iran, we still don’t have a 
clear picture from the administration 
about our strategy in the region. The 
only gesture of transparency that this 
administration has been able to muster 
was a classified all-Members briefing 
conducted more than a week after the 
strike. There were 97 Senators who at-
tended, but only 15 Members got to ask 
questions before the administration, 
led by Secretary Pompeo, practically 
sprinted out the door with a less-than- 
genuine commitment to return. Our de-
mands for a followup briefing have 
been ignored by the White House, Sec-
retary Esper, and Secretary Pompeo. 
Those briefings should have occurred 
before the action. I learned about what 
we were doing in the news, and 2 hours 
later got a call from the administra-
tion. 
I fear that by keeping Congress and 
the American people in the dark, Presi-
dent Trump may be directing military 
operations in a manner that doesn’t 
stand up to public scrutiny. When you 
are forced to consult with Congress and 
when Congress has the power to declare 
war, quick and sloppy thinking evapo-
rates because people have to at least 
examine the issues in some detail, and 
the American public has some say. 
That is why Senator KAINE’s War 
Powers Resolution is a matter of neces-
sity. I commend Senator KAINE and his 
colleagues on the job he has done, in-
cluding my colleague from Illinois, sit-
ting right here, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote in favor of it. 
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Madam President, now on the De-
partment of Justice. In the short week 
since the conclusion of the President’s 
impeachment trial, the President has 
reminded us of all the reasons why 
Congress must serve as the check on 
the Executive. 
The President has dismissed mem-
bers of his administration who testified 
in the House impeachment inquiry, in-
cluding, for no reason, the twin brother 
of one of the witnesses. The adminis-
tration has reportedly withdrawn the 
nomination of a senior Pentagon offi-
cial who merely advised her colleagues 
about the legal implications of delay-
ing assistance to Ukraine. Truth— 
when the President doesn’t like the 
truth, it has no place in this adminis-
tration, and people who speak truth to 
power are summarily dismissed. 
On Tuesday, after career prosecutors 
made sentencing recommendations for 
Roger Stone, who was found guilty of 
witness tampering and lying to Con-
gress, the President tweeted that his 
former colleague and confidant was 
being unfairly treated. Soon afterward, 
it appears the Attorney General or 
other political appointees at DOJ coun-
termanded 
the 
sentencing 
rec-
ommendation and will instead advise a 
more lenient sentence for the Presi-
dent’s friend. As a result, all four ca-
reer 
prosecutors 
connected 
to 
the 
Stone case withdrew from the case or 
resigned from the Justice Department 
entirely—a clear signal they believed 
the revised sentencing conflicted with 
their professional and ethical obliga-
tions as prosecutors. 
Of course, it was not enough for the 
President to just lean on the Justice 
Department to make it easy on his old 
pal. The President went on publicly to 
attack the judge who would decide Mr. 
Stone’s fate—another example of the 
President’s blatant contempt for the 
independence of the judiciary. 
In the past, Chief Justice Roberts has 
spoken out in defense of the independ-
ence of the judicial branch. When the 
President, during his campaign, at-
tacked Judge Curiel, the Chief Justice 
released a statement saying: 
We do not have Obama judges or Trump 
judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. We 
have an extraordinary group of dedicated 
judges doing their level best to do equal 
right to those appearing before them. The 
independent 
judiciary 
is 
something 
we 
should all be thankful for. 
That is what Chief Justice Roberts 
said. 
Well, President Trump is once again 
attacking a Federal judge—in this 
case, Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who 
is presiding over the Stone case. The 
Nation now looks again to Chief Jus-
tice Roberts to make clear to President 
Trump that these attacks are unac-
ceptable. Speaking of the independence 
of the judiciary in broad and general 
terms is well and good. It is a good 
thing to do, but to not speak up now, 
when in the middle of this brouhaha a 
judge is being attacked by the Presi-
dent before she makes a sentencing de-
cision, that is when we really need the 
Chief Justice to speak up. Now would 
be the time for Chief Justice Roberts 
to speak up. Now would be the time for 
the Chief Justice to directly and spe-
cifically defend the independence of 
this Federal judge. I hope he will see fit 
to do that and to do it today. 
I have also called on the inspector 
general of the Justice Department to 
investigate the Roger Stone matter. 
The Judiciary Committee in the Sen-
ate should do the same, but even with-
out formal investigation, it is abun-
dantly clear that something is rotten 
in the Justice Department. 
The President can corrupt our Jus-
tice Department in two major ways: 
pressuring it to investigate his oppo-
nents or using its power to reward his 
friends. The impeachment of the Presi-
dent concerned the first abuse: The 
President wanted a foreign power to 
announce an investigation into one of 
his political opponents or funnel alleg-
edly incriminating information to our 
Justice Department. The President ex-
plicitly mentioned the Attorney Gen-
eral during his phone call with the 
Ukrainian President. More recently, 
Attorney General Barr has publicly 
said that the Justice Department has 
now set up a channel to receive infor-
mation from the President’s personal 
attorney, Rudy Giuliani, about the 
Ukraine scandal. It seems to be an at-
tempt to accomplish the same goals 
the President was just impeached over. 
The events surrounding Mr. Stone’s 
more lenient sentencing recommenda-
tions are an example of the second way 
Presidents can corrupt the Justice De-
partment: improperly rewarding the 
President’s friends. In the wake of Wa-
tergate, Congress passed laws and made 
crucial reforms so this kind of abuse of 
the levers of power will not happen 
again, but here, right now, the Presi-
dent is using the hallowed Justice De-
partment—the only Cabinet agency 
named for an ideal, Justice—as his per-
sonal law firm. He is using the Justice

Department named for an ideal, Jus-
tice, as his personal law firm. 
What a shame. What a defamation of 
what the Constitution is all about. 
My Senate colleagues who believed 
the President would be chastened by 
impeachment have been completely 
and disastrously wrong. The only les-
son the President has learned is that 
there is nothing he can do that Senate 
Republicans will not forgive or ration-
alize or simply ignore. The lesson the 
President has learned is that the 
courts are unlikely to stop him, too, 
because the Senate Republican caucus 
has voted to confirm virtually every 
judge he has nominated, no matter how 
unqualified or ill-suited to the bench. 
We are staring at a crisis of the rule 
of law. The institutions designed to 
check Executive power are crumbling 
before our very eyes. The crisis was the 
President’s own making, but it was en-
abled and emboldened by every Senate 
Republican who has been too afraid to 
stand up to the President and say no. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for up 
to 3 minutes in debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 68. 
Senator KAINE, a distinguished member 
of the Foreign Relations Committee, 
has done an extraordinary job here in 
riveting our attention to a congres-
sional 
responsibility 
that 
is 
para-
mount. It calls for the removal of U.S. 
troops from hostilities against Iran 
that Congress has not authorized. 
One of the most consequential deci-
sions we make as Members of Con-
gress—I have been called on on more 
than one occasion between the House 
and the Senate—is whether to send our 
sons and daughters into battle. It is a 
decision that is about life and death 
and national security. The Constitu-
tion delegated that power to only one 
institution of the entire Federal Gov-
ernment—the Congress of the United 
States—to declare war, because of the 
severity of the consequences of the de-
cision. It is up to the Congress to en-
sure that the executive branch, who-
ever sits there at any given time, uti-
lizes all the tools of diplomacy it has 
to keep Americans safe and that there 
is an effective check on executive 
power before we send our children off 
to war. 
I stand in strong support of the reso-
lution. This body must assert its con-
gressional privilege. 
Of course, the President has the right 
to take action to defend against immi-
nent threats to the homeland and to 
Americans abroad. No one disputes 
that. Senator KAINE
doesn’t dispute 
that. None of us do. But the President 
does not have the authority to engage 
in any military action he likes. 
We have been hearing from this ad-
ministration that there is a redline— 
Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I 
agree. But if, at the end of the day, 
that means that to enforce your red-
line, you are going to take America to 
war, then you must come to the Con-
gress of the United States and seek 
that authorization for war. 
What I hear from the administration: 
Oh, no, we have article II powers. Oh, 
no, the 2002 resolution—which had 
nothing to do with Iran. Never envi-
sioned. It is so tortured to suggest that 
is authorization for us. Can we sit back 
and contemplate that possibility? We 
cannot. We cannot. 
So as someone who voted against the 
war in Iraq and served in Congress dur-
ing the debate on whether to authorize 
military action, I can assure you that 
the 2002 resolution—that was not its in-
tention, and it doesn’t comport with 
the history, the use, or the plain read-
ing of the text. 
I am gravely concerned about the ad-
ministration’s efforts to build a shaky 
legal foundation for the explicit pur-
pose of carrying us into ever-longer 
wars, including potentially against 
Iran. 
Before we vote to ultimately decide 
that, it should be the Congress of the 
United States that should make that 
decision on behalf of the American peo-
ple, looking our sons and daughters in 
the eyes and saying, yes, this is worthy 
of the national security of the United 
States. 
I will vote to send my son and daugh-
ter if the cause is right, but if the 
cause is not right, I will not vote to 
send my son and daughter or anyone 
else’s sons and daughters. That is the 
debate that should be had here. That is 
what Senator KAINE is trying to do 
with this resolution. I am concerned 
that some of the amendments being of-
fered are simply to undermine that. 
I look forward to joining with Sen-
ator KAINE to pass that resolution, as 
well as oppose some of the amend-
ments. 
I will submit a longer statement for 
the RECORD
on this resolution, S.J. 
Res. 68, and the War Powers Resolution 
more broadly when we return on Mon-
day, February 24. I urge my colleagues 
to read that statement. 
With that, I yield back. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1301 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate equally 
divided prior to a vote in relation to 
Cruz amendment No. 1301. 
Who yields time? 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I rise 
to speak in opposition to the Cruz 
amendment. 
The Cruz amendment is contrary to 
the purpose of the resolution before the 
body. The resolution before the body is 
to make sure that Congress is involved 
in decisions about war. The Cruz 
amendment is contrary to that purpose 
by praising the President for a military 
action taken not only without congres-
sional approval but without notifica-
tion to Congress. 
Second, we are all glad General 
Soleimani is dead. That is good for the 
world. But there are legitimate ques-
tions about the mission—particularly, 
should it have been taken out on Iraqi 
soil over the objection of the Iraqi Gov-
ernment? That has now led the Iraqi 
Parliament to ask U.S. troops to with-
draw from the region, which would em-
power Iran and empower ISIS. 
Finally, the Cruz amendment talks 
about President Trump. This resolu-
tion is not about President Trump. I 
had an original version of it that ref-
erenced activities of the administra-
tion, but my Republican colleagues—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. KAINE. Asked me to remove 
those. 
I ask for a vote against the amend-
ment. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Does 
anybody want to use time in favor of 
the amendment? 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President and fel-
low Senators, I rise in support of Sen-
ator CRUZ’s amendment. 
This is just a continuation of this an-
imosity toward this President. This 
President did a great service to the 
United States of America, to the people 
of America, and to the world by dis-
patching General Soleimani as he did. 
All of us listened to the intelligence. 
We had the secret and top-secret brief-
ings on this. In addition to that, those 
of us on the Intelligence Committee ac-
tually got information that was com-
partmented. They had very clear infor-
mation, proof to a very high degree 
that he was imminently attacking—he 
was imminently planning to attack 
Americans and American forces. 
This was the right thing to do. It rid 
the world of a person who really rose to 
the same level as Osama bin Laden and 
some of the other people who have done 
these awful things to Americans. We 
should congratulate this President—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
has expired. 
Mr. RISCH. Just as we did with 
President Obama. 
Thank you. I urge an affirmative 
vote. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-

The PRESIDING OFFICER. There

Reed amendment No. 1322. 
The majority whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the remaining 
votes in this series be 10 minutes in 
length. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Senator REED. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to 
offer my amendment noting that as a 
result of Iran’s recent ballistic missile 
strike against U.S. air bases in Iraq, 
over 100 servicemembers have sus-
tained traumatic brain injuries, or 
TBIs, as a result of their proximity to 
the blasts. 
It is vitally important that all U.S. 
Government personnel—military and 
civilian—who incur such injuries be 
given the care they deserve and that 
their medical records be properly anno-
tated to ensure they receive the care 
they are entitled to in the future. 
My amendment recognizes the seri-
ousness of these injuries and honors 
those who will now have to deal with 
these wounds, possibly for the rest of 
their lives. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this 
amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

President on the last amendment—the 
Commander in Chief, who made the 
very difficult decision to do what need-
ed to be done to rein up the terrorists 
and the people who are operating out of 
Iran—we also need to recognize the 
people on the frontlines, our brave 
young men and women who are in Iraq, 
pushing back on Iran’s attempt to in-
fluence and to infiltrate the country of 
Iraq. They are doing our work for us. 
We need to recognize that.

NOT VOTING—1 
Markey 
The amendment (No. 1322) was agreed 
to. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1305 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided, prior to the vote in relation 
to Cotton amendment No. 1305. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment and will 
be making a motion to table it fol-
lowing Senator COTTON’s presentation. 
The Cotton amendment would estab-
lish a very dangerous precedent. I say 
that with all respect. It would basi-
cally allow military action against ac-
tors on the designated list of foreign 
terrorist organizations without there 
being a declaration of war against 
them. 
There are currently 69 FTOs on the 
list, including the Basque Fatherland 
and Liberty, the Kurdistan Workers’ 
Party, the Irish Republican Army, and 
the Communist Party of the Phil-
ippines. 
The FTO list has never been a war 
authorization. The FTO list is created 
by the administration. It adds the 
names to it. This would suggest that, 
by being on the FTO, the U.S. military 
could take action against you even 
without there being congressional au-
thorization. The list is so long, and it 
can be added to by a President. This 
would basically destroy the underlying 
bill by allowing a President to add to 
the FTO list rather than coming to 
Congress and then taking military ac-
tion. 
I know the speaker’s intention is 
that this goes to the IRGC. If we need 
to defend ourselves under article II, we 
can or we can declare war. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, this is 
not about the Basque, and this is not 
about the IRA. This resolution applies 
only to the Government of Iran. This 
is, indeed, only about the Islamic Revo-
lutionary Guard Corps. 
Let me tell you a story about the 
last 17 years in Iraq. 
For 17 years, the most deadly weapon 
our troops have faced has been some-
thing called an explosively formed pen-
etrator. It takes a slug of copper, 
superheats it into a ball of magma, and 
sends it hurtling through the air at 
6,000 feet per second at our troops. I 
will spare you the graphic details of 
what a liquid ball of copper magma 
does when it travels at 6,000 feet per 
second into the human body, but I will 
tell you that those were smuggled into 
Iraq by, yes, the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps. 
The vote here is simple: Do you want 
to vote to stand with our troops, hun-
dreds of whom have died at the hands 
of Iran, or do you want to vote to be a 
lawyer for Iranian terrorists? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia.

VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1314 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to 
the Risch amendment, No. 1314. 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I want to 
be very clear. I oppose this resolution, 
as it is misguided and it sends a ter-
rible, confusing message to Iran and to 
our allies in the region. 
The purpose of my amendment is to 
make clear to Iran and to our allies 
that, under the Constitution, the Presi-
dent of the United States has a con-
stitutional responsibility to take ac-
tions to defend the United States, its 
Territories, possessions, citizens, serv-
icemembers, and diplomats from at-
tack. 
Who could disagree with that? 
Let’s make this clear to Iran and to 
our allies that that is the state of 
play—notwithstanding 
the 
fact, 
of 
course, that this resolution will not be-
come law. It is going to get vetoed, and 
the veto is going to be sustained. 
The clear language of this is very 
short: 
The President has a constitutional respon-
sibility to take actions to defend the United 
States, its territories, possessions, citizens, 
servicemembers, and diplomats from attack. 
Senators, make this clear. Vote yes 
on this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, though 
my friend from Idaho opposes my reso-
lution, I do not oppose his amendment. 
I view the Risch amendment as a basic 
restatement of constitutional law, and 
it is essentially the same concept as 
the rules of construction in the resolu-
tion, so I do not oppose it. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to amendment 
No. 1314. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask for 
the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second?

ond.

VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1320 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
FISCHER). There will now be 2 minutes 
of debate, equally divided, prior to the 
vote in relation to the Rubio amend-
ment No. 1320. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, this 
amendment is a statement of three 
facts: No. 1, that we are not engaged at 
this moment in hostilities with Iran— 
we are not at war with Iran; No. 2, that 
the actions that were taken against 
Soleimani were, frankly, lesser in 
scope, nature, and duration than what 
the previous administration did and 
the way they behaved in their exercise 
of war powers, also a statement of fact; 
and No. 3, that the maximum pressure 
of strategy against Iran has reduced 
Iran’s resources that they can use to 
sponsor terrorism and proxy groups, 
also a statement of fact. Whether you 
agree with maximum pressure or not, 
it is a fact that this year, and last 
year, Iran has billions of dollars less 
than they otherwise would have, had it 
not been for the maximum pressure 
campaign. 
Those three things are statements of 
fact, and I think if we are going to 
have a resolution like this, it should 
accurately describe the situation, and 
that is why I urge your support and a 
negative vote against any effort to 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. KAINE. Madam President, I ask 
my colleagues to vote to table the 
Rubio amendment No. 1320. Let me ex-
plain why. The gist of the amendment 
is basically to say that we are not in 
hostilities with Iran. If you read the 
newspaper, we now see that 100 Amer-
ican troops are suffering from concus-
sions—closed-head injuries—that could 
potentially lead to other significant 
consequences because of the Iranian at-
tack on the Al-Asad Air Base. 
The United States sent the military 
strike that killed Iran’s key military 
leader and Iraqi militia leader. The 
United States took a previous strike a 
week before that killed 25 Iranian-con-
nected militia members in 5 sites in 
Iraq and Syria. The War Powers Act 
has a definition of what armed conflict 
and hostilities are, and it is clear that 
Congress was meant to be able to file 
this exact motion either during armed 
conflict or even before armed conflict 
if it were imminent. 
I would argue that the 100 service-
members who are suffering from head 
injuries and the American contractor 
who was killed is definitely proof that 
there are hostilities. I ask to table. 
I now move that Rubio amendment 
No. 1320 be tabled, and I ask for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The motion is agreed to; the amend-
ment is tabled. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1319 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 2 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided, prior to a vote in relation to 
Sullivan amendment No. 1319. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
no one wants war with Iran, but while 
I respect Senator KAINE and my other 
colleagues who are supporting the 
broader AUMF, it has fatal flaws. 
First, it says the United States 
should cease its hostilities against 
Iran. This is completely backward. The 
United States is not actively con-
ducting hostilities against Iran, but 
Iran has been actively conducting hos-
tilities against us and our troops for 
decades. Just look at the long, bloody 
list: thousands of Americans dead and 
wounded, Marine barracks in Lebanon, 
Khobar 
Towers 
in 
Saudi 
Arabia, 
Soleimani, and deadly IEDs in Iraq. 
Second, the broader AUMF of Sen-
ator KAINE
dramatically limits our 
ability to protect these very forces 
from future attacks, which we know 
the Iranians are planning. Close to half 
of the forces in Iraq right now are Alas-
ka-based military forces, our friends 
and neighbors in Alaska. I want to 
make sure they are protected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. My amendment does 
that by making sure the President has 
clear authority to protect our troops. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Who requests time in opposition? 
Mr. LEE. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I have 
great respect for my distinguished col-
league from Alaska, and I appreciate 
his service to our country and his 
thoughts today. 
I stand in opposition to his amend-
ment because, if there is one thing we 
don’t need right now, it is anything 
else that would give more authority to 
the 
military-industrial 
complex 
to 
start and finish wars without author-
ization from Congress. 
Anytime we introduce additional am-
biguity into a field that is already ripe 
with ambiguity, given the inherent 
tension 
between 
ambiguities 
sur-
rounding the inherent article II Com-
mander in Chief power and the article 
I power that Congress has to declare 
war, we run into problems. This would 
open up that ambiguity. 
The legislation we are addressing 
here, this resolution, is bipartisan. It 
has as its object to clarify that, for fu-
ture, offensive action, we need congres-
sional authorization. We have been lied 
to by the Pentagon for years regarding 
a war that has gone on for two decades. 
That is long enough. We don’t want to 
create additional ambiguities. We don’t 
want any more wars without the peo-
ple’s elected representatives being able 
to debate it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I move

The motion is agreed to; the amend-
ment is tabled. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I 
think President Trump’s decision to 
take out General Soleimani was the 
boldest defense policy decision of his 
Presidency to date. Even in a single 
strike, the President defended Amer-
ican lives and showed Iran that ter-
rorism and, most importantly, spilling 
American blood is something that will 
come at a price, unlike what we have 
gone through with the predecessor, 
when the redline didn’t mean anything. 
It means something now. Everybody 
knows it. 
The result is that we are now in the 
best negotiating position with Iran 
since 1979, and Iran’s escalation, which 
includes attacks on tankers, Saudi 
Arabia’s oil facilities, and the killing 
of an American citizen, has ended, at 
least for now. 
Yet some Democrats would have you 
believe in a vote for a War Powers Res-
olution, pretending as though the 
President is rushing to war. It is just 
not happening. The facts are not there. 
There is no war with Iran. An airstrike 
is not a war. Punishing Iran for killing 
an American citizen is not a war, nor 
has the Soleimani strike started a new 
war, as Democrats would have you be-
lieve. It just hasn’t happened. 
It has been 3 weeks now since the 
Democrats first tried to vote on this 
resolution, and during those 3 weeks, 
nothing has happened. Let me just re-
peat that. Nothing has happened. There 
have been no new Iranian attacks 
against us, and we have not attacked 
them. How can anyone claim that we 
are at some kind of a war? 
Moreover, nobody wants war with 
Iran. The President has made it very 
clear that he doesn’t want war with 
Iran. In fact, the President’s decision 
to eliminate Soleimani has made war 
much less likely because it showed Iran 
that its terrorism would come at a 
price. That wasn’t the case before. 
Despite this success, today we are de-
bating whether we want to tie the 
hands of our Commander in Chief—or 
any Commander in Chief—to respond 
when American lives are put at risk, as 
the Constitution gives them the au-
thority to do. 
I want to be sure that all of my col-
leagues are crystal clear on what ex-
actly this War Powers 
Resolution 
means, what it will actually do. The 
resolution calls on the President to 
terminate the use of American Armed 
Forces for hostilities against Iran. But 
there are no hostilities against Iran. 
There is no war with Iran. 
The resolution calling for the termi-
nation of hostilities against California 
would have the same effect. Practically 
speaking, this vote will do nothing. It 
is nonsense, but we should be very con-
cerned about the symbolic effect this 
vote will have. 
This will send a very damaging mes-
sage to Iran. The Iranians will inter-
pret a vote in favor of this resolution 
as tying the President’s hands, and 
that would lead Iran to believe, once 
again, that it can get by with any-
thing. 
Remember, it wasn’t that long ago 
that they really believed that. Nobody 
wants that. Congress doesn’t want it. 
The White House doesn’t want it and 
certainly not the American people. So 
I don’t know why we are even debating 
a resolution that could make war more 
likely, when we are trying to do just 
the opposite. 
If the Democrats insist on tying the 
President’s hands, the least we can do 
is minimize the damage. While I urge 
my colleagues to vote against this res-
olution, I also urge them to support 
amendments to minimize the damage. 
I want to comment briefly on the 
amendment offered by the ranking 
member of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, my friend the Senator 
from Rhode Island. He is correct to 
highlight the traumatic brain injuries 
that a number of our troops suffered 
during the January 8 Iranian strike on 
Iraq. We understand that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1059 
February 13, 2020 
However, I would like to clarify: I be-
lieve we were not misled in this at all. 
Mild TBIs can only be confirmed 
through MRI scans. The Department of 
Defense implemented its screening pro-
cedure properly and made sure that all 
troops in the vicinity of the strike 
were screened. I think we need to un-
derstand that. All of this was done, and 
it is as if that wasn’t done at all. 
Once those results were made avail-
able, the Department of Defense noti-
fied the public in a press release. It 
then briefed our committee, the com-
mittee that I chair. I therefore want to 
commend the Department of Defense 
for taking all the right measures to 
protect our forces during the Iranian 
strikes and for appropriately screening 
our forces for aftereffects. 
This is why I think it is extremely 
important that we vote this resolution 
down. Even as it is amended now, it 
will signal to the Iranians that there is 
no price for aggression. It will under-
mine deterrence, and it will leave our 
troops, diplomats, and citizens vulner-
able. Nobody wants that. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
YOUNG). The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak with respect to final passage of 
S.J. Res. 68, which will be the next 
item of business before us. I will speak 
briefly because I have been on the floor 
about this a few times in the last week 
or two. 
First, I want to thank my colleagues 
for this process, including the Presi-
dent. It has been a very collaborative 
process, with a lot of dialogue, a lot of 
listening, a lot of changes in amend-
ments, and back and forth since early 
January. My colleagues, however they 
voted on things that I hoped they 
might support me on, were very willing 
to dialogue and ask hard questions. I 
understood why people were where 
they were. I just want to thank the 
body for it. 
I also note what a cool thing it is to 
actually have a bunch of amendment 
votes on the floor. I hope we might do 
more on other items. 
This is an issue that is extremely im-
portant to this body, and it is ex-
tremely important to me. Of the vari-
ety of issues—I didn’t serve in the mili-
tary—why would it be important to 
me? Having a child in the military and 
coming from a State that is so con-
nected to the military, I have been 
nearly obsessed with this issue since 
about 2002. 
I never knew I would have an oppor-
tunity to work on it as a U.S. Senator, 
but when I came here in 2012, I started 
to look for colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle and in both Houses who would 
stand for the proposition that war is 
the most solemn responsibility we 
have, and it cannot be outsourced to 
anyone. 
I was willing to stand up to a friend— 
a Democratic President—and challenge 
him when he was undertaking military 
action without coming to Congress. I 
have done the same with President 
Trump, but with no disrespect to the 
office. I want an article II President 
who will inhabit fully the article II 
powers of the office of Commander in 
Chief. But what I have hoped for since 
I came is an article I branch that 
would fully inhabit the article I powers 
that are vested only in Congress. 
For that reason, I put the resolution 
forward and worked with you and oth-
ers to make sure the resolution was bi-
partisan. It is not only bipartisan, but 
folks from different parts of the polit-
ical spectrum and from different parts 
of the country and new Members and 
veteran Members have come together 
to say—after many decades of abdi-
cating responsibility, under Presidents 
of both parties and under majorities of 
both parties in both Houses—it is time 
for Congress to take this very seri-
ously. That is why I will be voting in 
favor of the resolution and encouraging 
other colleagues to do the same. 
The last thing I want to say is this. 
I talked about these two young men 
briefly yesterday on the floor. I am 
struck by their stories. The last two 
men who were killed in combat for the 
United States in the 19-yearlong war 
against terrorists that was sparked by 
America’s righteous outrage over the 
attack of 9/11 were two sergeants first 
class, Javier Gutierrez and Antonio 
Rodriguez. They are both from the 
Southwest, one from San Antonio and 
one from Las Cruces, NM. 
They were both killed last week in 
Afghanistan by an insider attack. It 
was somebody who was wearing a uni-
form—potentially, a member of the Af-
ghan National Security Forces or pos-
ing as one. These are the security 
forces that we have invested billions 
and billions of dollars in training and 
equipping—$45 billion this year alone. 
Someone wearing that uniform of an 
ally of the United States turned a 
weapon on these two gentlemen and 
killed them. 
I read their bios, and I was just so 
struck by their stories. They were 28 
years old, which means they were 9 
years old when 9/11 happened and when 
Congress passed the war authorization 
under whose terms they were then 
serving when they lost their lives in 
Afghanistan. They really never knew 
in their life anything but war. 
By the time they were 9 years old the 
Nation was at war. Nineteen years 
later, we are still in the same war, and 
that authorization has been used now 
all over the globe to engage in military 
activity virtually in so many countries 
and so many continents. They never 
knew anything but war. 
I just want to say a word about each 
of them. 
Sergeant Gutierrez was a young man, 
a 28-year-old from San Antonio. Ser-
geant Gutierrez’s grandfather was an 
aviator in World War II who was shot 
down and imprisoned in a POW camp in 
Germany. His name was Mr. Ortiz. He 
was then liberated when the Russians 
liberated that POW camp. That was the 
grandfather. Sergeant Gutierrez’s dad 
was a marine during the Vietnam era. 
Sergeant Gutierrez was born in Jack-
sonville, NC, near the Lejeune base in 
North Carolina. All he wanted to do 
was serve his country. He joined the 
Junior ROTC Program at his local high 
school because, he said, ‘‘I want to be 
like my grandfather and I want to be 
like my dad.’’ By all accounts, he 
served in such a wonderful way. 
This was his third deployment. He 
had one in Iraq and one in Afghanistan 
previously. This was his third deploy-
ment. 
He leaves behind a wife, Gabby, and 
four children ages 2 to 7. 
Sergeant Rodriguez was from Las 
Cruces, NM. He also leaves behind a 
wife, Ronaleen, no children, but a lot of 
devoted family. 
When I read this in the news, I 
thought it was a misprint. This was 
Sergeant Rodriguez’s 11th deployment 
to Afghanistan. He was only 28 years 
old. He probably didn’t go into the 
military until he was 18, but he was 
Special 
Forces. 
Those 
deployments 
tend to be often, more frequent and 
maybe not as long in duration. But 
think about it—10 times in Afghani-
stan, and on the 11th deployment, he 
gave his life. The sacrifices are just 
kind of staggering for me to con-
template. 
I will just conclude and say this: I 
know that everybody in this Chamber 
goes to VA hospitals to visit. I have 
three VA hospitals in Virginia. I was in 
one in Hampton last Friday. We do this 
because we want to see our great care 
providers. We talk to our veterans. We 
get inspired by stories of resilience and 
see cutting-edge treatments and tech-
nologies. 
Often, those visits are empowering 
and inspiring. One thing you will al-
ways feel when you leave after a visit 
to a VA hospital—and I felt this way 
when I left the VA in Hampton last 
Friday afternoon—is the enduring con-
sequences of war. When I was visiting a 
mental health unit, when I was visiting 
the women’s clinic that now deals with 
the increasing number of women vet-
erans, what you grapple with are the 
enduring consequences of war. 
Under the best of circumstances, 
when we get it right and we win, there 
are still horrible consequences of war— 
people’s health and people’s lives and 
then the lives and health of the care-
givers and friends of those who serve. 
Because those consequences are so mo-
mentous and so enduring, those of us in 
this body—and maybe especially those 
of us in this body who didn’t wear the 
uniform and didn’t serve—we have a 
special obligation to make sure that we 
deliberate and deliberate carefully be-
fore we send troops into harm’s way. 
The President of the United States— 
this President and every President—al-
ways needs the ability to defend the 
United States against imminent attack 
without asking for anybody’s permis-
sion. I think the world knows we will 
do that. This body, though, is a body

that needs to decide if we go on offense 
and engage in military action. Guess 
what. The world knows we will do that 
too. 
We took that vote on the war author-
ization in 2001, and 18 years later, we 
have tens of thousands of troops de-
ployed and people still losing their 
lives. We are spending $45 billion a year 
in Afghanistan to preserve the gains 
that we won. No one can question 
America’s resolve. But this resolution 
is about a level of deliberation to 
match the sacrifice that we expect. The 
sacrifice is momentous, so our delib-
eration should be careful. That is what 
this bill is designed to do. That is why 
I am so proud to have worked on it 
with my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow 
Senators, we are about to vote on an 
important 
piece 
of 
legislation. 
Of 
course, it is a piece of legislation that 
will never become law, but nonetheless 
it deserves our attention, and certainly 
it deserves serious consideration. 
We know two things as we approach 
this. No. 1, under the Constitution, it is 
absolutely crystal clear that only Con-
gress can declare war. No. 2, which is 
crystal clear, we know the President of 
the United States has the authority to 
defend the country. Finally, No. 3—and 
this is very important, as it relates to 
this—no one wants war with Iran. No 
one agrees that we should proceed to 
war with Iran. That is simply not the 
situation here today. 
There are constitutional questions 
here that we know we have to wrestle 
with, and they are difficult ones. 
It is important to note here, first of 
all, that the dispute that has been 
going on with Iran for a long, long time 
has really nothing to do with the Ira-
nian people. We support the Iranian 
people. They have a long history, a 
proud tradition, and they deserve sub-
stantially better than what they are 
getting in leadership today. 
This is an important debate we are 
going to have today about war powers 
and the use of military force. 
One thing also that is clear but that 
muddies the water is that there is no 
clear line of delineation between actual 
war and the use of kinetic force. 
As I said, it is important to have this 
debate. I really believe it should not be 
held in this context. It should be a pol-
icy that we are debating that is useable 
in all contexts. I have sat through doz-
ens of hours of debate on war powers, 
the war powers of the President. It is 
an age-old debate that has gone on 
since George Washington was Presi-
dent. It is a hard debate because all 
these words were written in the 18th 
century, and things were a lot clearer 
then. Things are much less clear today. 
These debates were long. There were 
many lawyers involved. Indeed, no con-
clusion can be reached. 
It is one of those areas where I have 
come to the conclusion that the words 
that need to be written in order to 
clearly specify the place that the 
President occupies and the place that 
the Congress occupies is a very, very 
difficult one. 
There are things on this Earth—and I 
really believe this may be one of 
them—where we know it when we see 
it, but we can’t define it. We know war 
when we see it. We also know what ki-
netic action is, in order to protect the 
people of the United States, that is 
more isolated in the hands of the Presi-
dent doing the defensive measure. We 
know that when we see it. But defining 
the distinction between the two when 
one blurs into the other is very, very 
difficult. 
The President needs the authority 
that he has to defend the United 
States, and it is clear that authority 
comes from three buckets: No. 1, it 
comes from article II of the U.S. Con-
stitution; No. 2, it comes from the War 
Powers Act; and No. 3, it comes from 
the AUMFs that have been passed by 
this body for some time. 
Iran, as you are listening, understand 
that the President has that authority. 
He has specific authority from all of 
those buckets. Notwithstanding the ar-
guments that have been made here by 
some Members of this body, the Presi-
dent unquestionably has those powers. 
This power has been used very spar-
ingly by this President. Compared to 
the last administration, the numbers 
are really, indeed, striking. The drone 
action, drone strikes that have been 
taken then and now—during the Obama 
administration, there were 540 of them 
over 8 years. In this particular admin-
istration, they are very, very few and 
far between and can only be described 
as a handful. 
This is a President who abhors the 
use of military force. I have had the op-
portunity to discuss it with him at 
length. I have actually been in the 
room when he has been confronted with 
these questions and had to make the 
decisions. He is deeply moved by these 
kinds of questions and understands 
how difficult they are. When he talks 
about how he has to write letters to 
the families of the men and women who 
didn’t come home, about having to 
make those phone calls, about having 
to go to Dover to receive the remains 
of our brave men and women who 
didn’t make it home alive, he is deeply, 
deeply disturbed by these matters. I 
can tell you, as I said, having been 
there, when he has had to make these 
decisions, they weigh heavily on him. 
So what are we doing here today? It 
certainly isn’t to rein in this Presi-
dent. He has not used his power willy- 
nilly, as I have indicated. It has been 
used very, very sparingly, and it has 
been used in great contrast to the pre-
vious administration. 
Well, what we are doing here today is 
we are trying to get our arms around 
the question of, when is it appropriate 
for the President to use military force? 
We all have our ideas on that. We have 
the words that the Founding Fathers 
left us, so we are going to debate it 
here today. And it is important. 
The unfortunate part about this is 
that we are also sending a message to 
Iran. Iran is listening. There is no 
question that they are listening to this 
debate. They are listening to what peo-
ple are saying here on the floor of the 
Senate. 
One of the messages that will come 
out of this and the way this is drawn is 
that the drafters of this want to send a 
message of appeasement to Iran. This 
has been tried. It hasn’t worked. The 
last administration bent over back-
ward to offer appeasement to Iran. 
They were greatly betrayed by it. It 
was tried with the JCPOA, and it didn’t 
work. The reason it didn’t work is that 
we are not dealing with people here 
who are acting in good faith. 
What we need to do is to send a mes-
sage of firmness and not weakness. At 
the end of the day, when we are all 
done with this, there will be such a 
message. It needs to be a consistent 
and a uniform message when it comes 
to messaging to Iran and when it 
comes to the messaging of our foreign 
policy as it relates to Iran. It will not 
be this law that is before us, because it 
is going to be vetoed. We all know it is 
going to be vetoed. It takes a two- 
thirds majority to override that. It is 
not going to happen. 
So the mixed message is there. Iran 
will listen to it. The hard-liners will 
take it one way, and other people will 
take it the other. That is not a good 
situation. Hopefully, we will be able to 
lay this out in a way in which they can 
read between the lines and get the mes-
sage that is important. 
The President took an action that 
people have criticized here that was 
difficult. It was a tough decision. He 
was a really bad guy—a guy who was 
worse than Osama bin Laden. He was 
the person who was executing Iran’s 
malign policies in the world and in the 
region. His killings and loss of limbs 
have become legendary in the world 
today. Whenever I see one of our young 
men or women who is missing an arm 
or a leg, he or she owes that to General 
Soleimani. He killed hundreds of peo-
ple. He was responsible for the IED pro-
gram that took the lives of so many 
and maimed so many of our men and 
women who were fighting in the Middle 
East. It got to the point at which he 
was wandering around, really, with im-
punity and was not worried about what 
he was doing or that anybody was 
going to take any action against him. 
Let’s look at the timeline over the 
last year. 
The Iranians started by blowing up 
oil tankers, and nothing was done 
about it. They attacked the Saudi oil 
fields, where 100 Americans were work-
ing, and nothing was done about it. 
They took down a drone of ours over 
international space, and nothing was 
done about it. Finally, over the fall, 
they ratcheted it up with 13 attacks on 
U.S. soldiers at U.S. bases in Iraq. 
These were our men and our women

whom we had asked to go over there 
and push back against Iran’s attempt 
at infiltration into Iraq. They took 13 
attacks. Finally, on one of those at-
tacks, somebody was killed. The Presi-
dent laid down a redline that, if an 
American were killed, there was going 
to be a price to pay. They finally killed 
that person. They attacked our Em-
bassy in Baghdad and attempted to set 
it on fire. 
Eventually, the President made the 
choice to do what he did. This was in 
response to Iran’s continual pushing of 
the envelope and the miscalculations 
that Iran made. General Soleimani had 
been traveling from place to place, put-
ting in place the final plans of coordi-
nation for the execution of an attack 
against the American people. It was 
imminent. 
You have heard my friends here say: 
Oh, no. It was not imminent. We lis-
tened to the intelligence. 
I sit on the Intelligence Committee. I 
sat through all of the briefings that 
were given that were at the secret level 
and at the top secret level that were 
given to the people who are here in the 
body. I also sat through the ones that 
were given to the Intelligence Com-
mittee, which were compartmented and 
much more granular. There was no 
doubt that this man was planning an 
imminent attack to kill Americans. He 
didn’t get the chance. 
Thank you, Mr. President. Thank 
you for what you did. 
We have heard the argument here 
that it was not imminent. This person 
was substantially more of an imminent 
danger to the United States of America 
and to Americans than Osama bin 
Laden was. Yet, when the President of 
the United States, Barack Obama, took 
out Osama bin Laden, we all cheered it. 
In fact, we passed a resolution here— 
100 to 0—commending the President of 
the United States for what he did. 
Mr. President, you heard us today 
pass such a resolution that thanks you. 
Thank you, Mr. President, and fare-
well, General Soleimani. 
Iran, do not miscalculate and read 
what is happening here as being capitu-
lation or weakness or appeasement. It 
is not. It is a disagreement between 
this branch of government, the legisla-
tive branch, and our second branch of 
government, the executive branch, as 
to how we should defend ourselves. 
Make no mistake about it: We will de-
fend ourselves. 
In America, we operate under the 
rule of law. This joint resolution that 
is in front of us that we are debating 
today will not become law. It will not 
be part of the body of law by which we 
live. It will be vetoed. 
Iran, take note: If you continue on 
the path that you are on with your ma-
lign activities, it is going to take you 
to a very bad place. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. I understand how 
it is going to come out. I will be stand-
ing here again to sustain the Presi-
dent’s veto, and it will be sustained. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the scheduled 
1:45 p.m. vote commence now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will read the joint resolu-
tion for the third time. 
The joint resolution was ordered to 
be engrossed for a third reading and 
was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint 
resolution having been read the third 
time, the question is, Shall the joint 
resolution, as amended, pass? 
Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask 
for the yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 68), as 
amended, was passed, as follows: 
S.J. RES. 68 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) Congress has the sole power to declare 
war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the 
United States Constitution. 
(2) The President has a constitutional re-
sponsibility to take actions to defend the 
United States, its territories, possessions, 
citizens, service members, and diplomats 
from attack. 
(3) Congress has not yet declared war upon, 
nor enacted a specific statutory authoriza-
tion for use of military force against, the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran. The 2001 Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force (Public Law 
107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) against the per-
petrators of the 9/11 attack and the Author-
ization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107–243; 
50 U.S.C. 1541 note) do not serve as a specific 
statutory authorization for the use of force 
against Iran. 
(4) The conflict between the United States 
and the Islamic Republic of Iran constitutes, 
within the meaning of section 4(a) of the War 
Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either 
hostilities or a situation where imminent in-
volvement in hostilities is clearly indicated 
by the circumstances into which United 
States Armed Forces have been introduced. 
(5) Members of the United States Armed 
Forces and intelligence community, and all 
those involved in the planning of the Janu-
ary 2, 2020, strike on Qasem Soleimani, in-
cluding President Donald J. Trump, should 
be commended for their efforts in a success-
ful mission. 
(6) Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that ‘‘at any 
time that United States Armed Forces are 
engaged in hostilities outside the territory 
of the United States, its possessions and ter-
ritories without a declaration of war or spe-
cific statutory authorization, such forces 
shall be removed by the President if the Con-
gress so directs’’. 
(7) More than 100 members of the United 
States Armed Forces sustained traumatic 
brain injuries in the Iranian retaliatory at-
tack on the Ain al-Assad air base in Iraq de-
spite initial reports that no casualties were 
sustained in the attack. 
(8) Section 8(c) of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1547(c)) defines the introduc-
tion of the United States Armed Forces to 
include ‘‘the assignment of members of such 
armed forces to command, coordinate, par-
ticipate in the movement of, or accompany 
the regular or irregular forces of any foreign 
country or government when such military 
forces are engaged, or there exists an immi-
nent threat that such forces will become en-
gaged in, hostilities’’. 
(9) The United States Armed Forces have 
been introduced into hostilities, as defined 
by the War Powers Resolution, against Iran. 
(10) The question of whether United States 
forces should be engaged in hostilities 
against Iran should be answered following a 
full briefing to Congress and the American 
public of the issues at stake, a public debate 
in Congress, and a congressional vote as con-
templated by the Constitution. 
(11) Section 1013 of the Department of 
State Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1984 
and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 1546a) provides that any 
joint resolution or bill to require the re-
moval of United States Armed Forces en-
gaged in hostilities without a declaration of 
war or specific statutory authorization shall 
be considered in accordance with the expe-
dited procedures of section 601(b) of the 
International Security and Arms Export 
Control Act of 1976. 
SEC. 2. TERMINATION OF THE USE OF UNITED 
STATES FORCES FOR HOSTILITIES 
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF 
IRAN. 
(a) TERMINATION.—Pursuant to section 1013 
of the Department of State Authorization 
Act, Fiscal Years 1984 and 1985 (50 U.S.C. 
1546a), and in accordance with the provisions 
of section 601(b) of the International Secu-
rity Assistance and Arms Export Control Act 
of 1976, Congress hereby directs the Presi-
dent to terminate the use of United States 
Armed Forces for hostilities against the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran or any part of its gov-
ernment or military, unless explicitly au-
thorized by a declaration of war or specific 
authorization for use of military force 
against Iran.

5G 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk for a few minutes today about 
5G, the Federal Communications Com-
mission, and swamp creatures. 
We have all heard a lot about 5G, and 
5G is just incredibly fast internet. It 
will make possible things like driver-
less cars, telemedicine, and the inter-
net of things. 
I want to caution all of us that these 
things are not going to happen over-
night. In fact, some parts of our coun-
try already have 5G, and we don’t have 
driverless cars and the internet of 
things and long-distance surgery. 
These innovations are going to hap-
pen over a long period of time, and in 
the meantime, there is going to be a 
lot of hype from the telecommuni-
cations companies. Why? Because they 
want to sell you 5G. They are going to 
tell you that 5G can do all these in-
credible things. They are going to tell 
you that 5G can grow hair, that 5G can 
cure erectile dysfunction, that 5G can 
do this and it can do that. 
Look, I want to be on record as say-
ing 5G is going to be extraordinary, but 
it is not going to happen overnight. 
The emergency that some of our tele-
communications companies are trying 
to create is not nearly the emergency 
that really exists because they have 
something they want to sell you. I am 
not putting them down. That is free en-
terprise. 
How does 5G work? Well, it is wire-
less technology. When I have 5G on my 
phone and you have 5G on your phone, 
we communicate—whether it is 5G 
wireless 
technology 
or 
otherwise— 
through radio waves. Radio waves go 
from my phone to your phone, and they 
carry data. It is called electromagnetic 
radiation, but all it is, is really radio 
waves. And there are all different kinds 
of radio waves. It depends on the fre-
quency. 
Do you know who owns those radio 
waves? The FCC doesn’t. The tele-
communications companies, which use 
those radio waves, don’t. The Federal 
Government doesn’t, except in this 
sense: You own those radio waves. The 
American taxpayer owns those radio 
waves. And they are incredibly valu-
able because telecommunications com-
panies line up when the FCC has new 
radio waves available for them. They 
line up to bid on those radio waves, 
which they can use. We call that spec-
trum. 
There is a certain type of radio wave 
going through the air—or spectrum, if 
you will—that is perfect for 5G. It is 
like Goldilocks’ porridge—it is not too 
hot; it is not too cold; it is just right. 
The 
telecommunications 
companies 
want to use that C band, we call it, or 
midrange spectrum. I am going to call 
it C band. They want the FCC to li-
cense it to them. 
Well, right now, using that spectrum, 
that C band—remember, these are the 
radio waves, the spectrum, that are 
just perfect for 5G. Right now, using 
this C band spectrum are a number of 
satellite companies, most of which are 
foreign-owned. 
The 
major 
satellite 
companies that are using it right now 
happen to be domiciled in Luxem-
bourg—wonderful country and wonder-
ful people. Do you know what they pay 
to the American taxpayer to use that 
spectrum? Nothing. Zero. Nada. 
You say: Well, how did that happen, 
KENNEDY? You just told me that these 
radio waves are very valuable and that 
the telecommunications companies are 
lined up to lease them. How did the for-
eign satellite companies get the C band 
for nothing if they are using it right 
now? 
I don’t know. It wasn’t this FCC, but 
some FCC just gave it to them and 
said: Here, use it for free. 
I wasn’t there. I am not necessarily 
criticizing them. I am just telling you 
they got it for nothing. But they didn’t 
get a license. They don’t have a lease. 
They have a privilege to use it. In the 
fine print of the document that gives 
them this privilege, at any time, the 
FCC can take it back because the for-
eign satellite companies don’t have a 
property interest. They don’t own it. 
They don’t have a lease. They didn’t 
pay anything for it. They just have the 
privilege to use it until the FCC wants 
to take it back. 
Now, the foreign satellite compa-
nies—and I am not criticizing them. 
God bless them. They are making a lot 
of money using this spectrum that be-
longs to the American taxpayer for 
free. Well, that is the way it has been 
for a while. Now, some telecommuni-
cations companies like Verizon and 
others—good companies—they say: We 
need that C band, FCC. We need that C 
band to use for 5G. 
Well, the satellite companies—I will 
call them the Luxembourg satellite 
companies—once again, good people. 
Luxembourg is a good country. They 
said: Well, we are using the C band 
right now. We don’t want to give it up 
to the telecommunications companies, 
but we will make you a deal. 
They went to the FCC. The satellite 
companies said to the FCC: We are 
using the C band right now, and even 
though we didn’t pay a single solitary 
dime for it, we know the telecommuni-
cations companies want it to imple-
ment 5G, so here is what we will do. 
You, FCC, give us the C band. Give it 
to us, and we will turn around and 
make sure that the telecommuni-
cations companies get to use it. We 
will lease it to them. 
The amount of money that the for-
eign satellite companies would have 
made was about $70 billion. I call it 
‘‘The Bank Job’’ robbery. Remember 
that movie that came out in 2008, ‘‘The 
Bank Job’’? It was a 2008 heist movie. 
It was about the 1971 Baker Street rob-
bery in London. I call this proposal 
‘‘The Bank Job’’ robbery. I don’t see 
how the foreign satellite companies 
made the proposal with a straight face. 
Give us this C band that belongs to the 
American people. Just give it to us, 
and we are going to sell it to the tele-
communications companies and pocket 
the $70 billion. 
Do you know what? Our FCC almost 
did it. They were this close. They said: 
Oh, we have to do this because we have

to get this C band to the telecommuni-
cations companies because it is an 
emergency. We have to get 5G tomor-
row, so let’s just give the satellite com-
panies that are using it now—didn’t 
pay a red dime for it—let’s give them 
the spectrum that belongs to the 
American people and let them sell it to 
the telecommunications companies and 
pocket the $70 billion because our hair 
is on fire and we have to do it. 
Swamp creatures. They came this 
close to stealing $70 billion from the 
American people, but they didn’t pull 
it off because a number of Members of 
the Senate and the House of Represent-
atives started raising fresh hell—fresh 
hell. 
I went to see the President of the 
United States. 
I said: Mr. President, do you know 
what is going on here? Here you are 
every day saying ‘‘Buy American. We 
have to take care of America first.’’ It 
doesn’t mean we don’t care about the 
rest of the world, but we have to buy 
American, and your FCC over here is 
giving away this C band to Luxem-
bourg satellite companies. 
He said: What in God’s name? 
He was like Rocketman. He got mad. 
I don’t speak for the President, but I 
am just telling you what happened. 
So the FCC, to its credit, backed off. 
They said: No, we are not going to give 
it away. We are going to do what we 
should have done in the first place; 
that is, auction it off. 
They are going to hold an auction 
like on eBay, and these satellite com-
panies—rather, 
these 
telecommuni-
cation companies can come in and bid. 
If the FCC would do it right, we would 
take in $70 billion for the American 
taxpayer, and we could use that money 
to implement rural broadband, and 
then everybody would be happy. 
It would have been great, but no, 
here comes the ‘‘Baby Driver’’ heist. 
Did you see that movie, ‘‘Baby Driv-
er’’? Now there is a new proposal on the 
table. The Chairman of our FCC—who 
is a good man, by the way; I am going 
to come back to him—he has come up 
with a new proposal. To his credit, the 
Chairman says: We are going to bid it 
out, but we are going to take $15 bil-
lion of the money that comes in, and 
we are going to give it to the foreign 
satellite companies. 
For what? They don’t own it. They 
don’t have a license; they just have a 
privilege. He is going to give $5 billion 
to them to relocate to different spec-
trum, and then he is going to give 
them $10 billion—that is nine zeros—in 
walking-around money just to go away. 
That is why I call it the ‘‘Baby Driver’’ 
heist. That was a great movie. Did you 
see that, starring Jamie Foxx? Wonder-
ful movie. 
Let me say this about the FCC Chair-
man: He is a friend of mine, and he is 
smart as a whip. He went to Harvard 
undergrad, honors degree, Chicago Law 
School, 
Chicago 
Law 
Review, 
and 
worked as an executive at Verizon 
Communications for a while. I consider 
him a friend, and I have the utmost re-
spect for him, and I thank him for fi-
nally agreeing to do a public auction 
and not give the C band away to the 
foreign satellite companies. But as 
much as I respect the Chairman, I 
wouldn’t take him with me if I was 
going to buy a car because he would 
pay the full sticker price. If I needed 
somebody to explain string theory to 
me or the Doppler effect or quantum 
engineering or genome sequencing, I 
would probably go to the Chairman of 
the FCC because he is that smart. But 
I don’t agree with him that he has 
made a good deal to give $10 billion 
away to these foreign satellite compa-
nies—$10 billion of American taxpayer 
money that ought to be going to things 
like rural broadband. 
The Chairman is going to present 
that to the FCC to vote on it on Feb-
ruary 28. He says he has the votes to 
pass it. I can tell you this, it is not 
going to be unanimous, and it is not 
going to be noncontroversial to give 
away $15 billion to somebody who 
doesn’t have a property interest. 
He says: We have to do it because we 
are in a race with China. 
OK. I agree with that. And your point 
is? 
He says: Well, if we don’t do it, the 
satellite companies are going to sue us. 
That is another straw man. Let me 
tell you something. The FCC gets sued 
every day. Do you know what the FCC 
Chairman needs to tell the satellite 
companies? He needs to tell them: Hey, 
do you need me to draw you a map to 
the courthouse? Go sue. We get sued 
every day, but I am not going to give 
you $15 billion of taxpayer money to go 
away because it is wrong. 
I am not sure the FCC has any au-
thority to do this. Last time I checked, 
it 
was 
Congress 
that 
appropriates 
money, not the Federal Communica-
tions Commission. 
I told you that the FCC Chairman’s 
proposal is to give the foreign satellite 
companies $5 billion to buy new sat-
ellites and to move to a new spectrum, 
and $10 billion just to go away because 
they say: Oh, we are scared of a law-
suit. We are scared of a lawsuit. 
I don’t know how he arrived at $10 
billion to give to them. I wish some-
body would give me $10 billion. Why 
not $11 billion? Why not $8 billion? 
Why not $7 billion? There is no expla-
nation. We are just going to give them 
$10 billion of taxpayer money, and they 
are going to go away. 
Of course, the satellite companies, 
they are happy as clams. They are as 
happy as a gopher in soft dirt because 
they are getting $10 billion for nothing. 
And they are also getting $5 billion to 
buy new satellites, but if you check, all 
the satellites now are worn out, so they 
would have to buy new satellites any-
way—5G or not. 
The FCC needs to wait. On February 
28, they need to announce and vote to 
have the public auction as they had 
promised. It will be held in December 
of this year. There is absolutely not a 
single solitary reason why the Chair-
man of the FCC has to put a vote in 
front of the FCC to give away $15 bil-
lion of taxpayer money. We can nego-
tiate a better deal. We can negotiate a 
better deal. 
The Chairman of the FCC does not 
need to become known as the $15 bil-
lion man. He needs to hold up and let 
us talk to the satellite companies and 
negotiate a better deal. 
Now, if he is not willing to do that, 
he needs to at least tell President 
Trump because do you know who is 
going to get blamed for this? The 
President. It will not be his fault, but 
he is going to get blamed for it because 
it happened on his watch. 
Here he is, out there talking about 
the American economy, we have to pro-
tect our economy, and we have to buy 
American first. It doesn’t mean we 
don’t love the rest of the world, but his 
FCC is just giving away $15 billion of 
taxpayer money—of taxpayer money— 
to our friends and foreign satellite 
companies, and the President will get 
blamed. So I am hoping the FCC at 
least goes to see him and tell him what 
they are going to do. 
When the American public finds out 
about this, you are not going to be able 
to find the FCC members who came up 
with this idea. You are not going to be 
able to find them with a flashlight, 
with a map, or with a search party. 
You will not be able to find them with 
Google. They are going to be hiding. It 
is an embarrassment. 
They may have the votes to do this, 
but I am not giving up. I have a bill, 
along 
with 
Senator 
SCHUMER—yes, 
CHUCK and I are working on a bill to-
gether—Senator 
CANTWELL, 
Senator 
SCHATZ, and we are going to have some 
others on the bill, that says: Look, this 
is Congress’s decision, not FCC’s deci-
sion. It would allocate a much more 
modest sum to these foreign satellite 
companies. I would like the FCC, if it 
would, to step back, continue on with 
its auction planning and give us a 
chance to negotiate on behalf of the 
American taxpayer. 
I am going to close with this point: 
Not a single day passes in this Cham-
ber that I don’t hear one of us, Demo-
crats and Republicans, talking about 
the deficits, and, boy, are they high— 
$22 trillion and climbing. We borrow $1 
million a minute to run this place. So 
$1.4 billion a day, that is how much 
more we spend than we take in. We are 
mortgaging our kids’ future. Every-
body talks about it and says we have to 
do something about it. 
We are like a problem gambler chas-
ing his losses. Some say we are like a 
drunk sailor, but we are worse than a 
drunk sailor. A drunk sailor stops 
spending when he runs out of money. 
We don’t. We just borrow it. 
Here we are, in the middle of all of 
this, and our Federal Communications 
Commission is going to give away $15 
billion. Our Chairman, henceforth, will 
be known as the $15 billion man. 
If they do this without telling the 
President, 
without 
consulting

Congress, and without trying to nego-
tiate a better deal for the American 
taxpayer, then we ought to change 
their name from the Federal Commu-
nications Commission to the ‘‘Federal 
Sucker Commission’’ because that is 
all they are. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 
1924, when Oklahoma was a very young 
State, a young lady named Ada was 
born in Chickasha. Now, you would get 
that joke if you are from Oklahoma be-
cause we have a town in Oklahoma 
called Ada and a town in Oklahoma 
called Chickasha. This is a young lady 
named Ada born in Chickasha. 
She thrived. She was an excellent 
student. In fact, she was the valedic-
torian of her high school, Lincoln High 
School. She left that and went to col-
lege. She stayed 1 year at one college, 
then transferred to another college and 
graduated with honors in 1945. 
She dreamed of being a lawyer. She 
had graduated with honors. She had 
graduated valedictorian. She had all 
the credentials and all the capabilities 
to do it, but she had one big problem: 
She was Black. In Oklahoma in the 
1940s, there were no law schools that 
would allow a Black student to attend. 
So, in Oklahoma, the policy was to 
help Black students who wanted to be 
a lawyer leave the State to study 
somewhere else. 
She really didn’t want to do that. 
She had graduated from the great 
Langston University and had a great 
education there and had every ability 
to do that. She interviewed with the 
University of Oklahoma—interviewed, 
actually, with the president of the 
school at that time—to go through the 
process to get into the University of 
Oklahoma law school. 
She was found to be fully qualified, 
but the problem was, again, she was 
Black. And it wasn’t just a problem 
with the University of Oklahoma. At 
that time, there was State law that did 
not allow Black students and White 
students to study together—and cer-
tainly not to study law together. 
So she did a radical thing. On April 6, 
1946, she filed a lawsuit against the 
State of Oklahoma saying that she 
wanted to study law at the very good 
University of Oklahoma law school. A 
young lawyer took up her case, a gen-
tleman named Thurgood Marshall, a 
young lawyer who later became Su-
preme Court Justice Thurgood Mar-
shall. Young Thurgood Marshall took 
up her case to argue in front of Okla-
homa district court, where they lost, 
arguing it all the way to the State su-
preme court, where they lost, lost, lost. 
Then they took it into Federal court, 
saying that, constitutionally, neither 
the United States of America nor any 
State in the United States could block 
a student from studying law simply be-
cause they were Black. They won that 
case. 
Probably returning back to Okla-
homa to study, the Oklahoma Legisla-
ture hurriedly put together a new law 
school and called it Langston Law 
School and opened up a room in the 
State capitol and put a few books there 
and said: There is your law school. 
Thurgood Marshall and Ada Fisher 
did not accept that—nor should they 
have—and started the process again of 
saying: We can’t have a separate but 
‘‘equal’’ law school in Oklahoma. They 
argued again in State courts, eventu-
ally ending up again heading all the 
way back to the Supreme Court. 
Before it got to the Supreme Court 
and Oklahoma would lose again in 
front of the same nine Justices, they 
determined that they would break, and 
they would give. On June 18, 1949, more 
than 3 years after she started the proc-
ess of getting into law school, she was 
admitted into the University of Okla-
homa College of Law, where she was 
given a seat in the back of the room 
with a sign directly in front of her that 
read ‘‘coloreds only,’’ and she could sit 
in that row in the back of the room. 
In 1950, just the next year, those bar-
riers would come down, and in August 
of 1952, Ada Fisher graduated from the 
University of Oklahoma law school and 
became a lawyer. She set the pace for 
thousands and thousands of others who 
are lawyers behind her now and get the 
chance of having that same joy. 
Interestingly enough, if you were to 
visit the courthouse in Oklahoma City, 
the Federal district court there—if you 
were there a couple years of ago, you 
would have bumped into Vicki Miles- 
LaGrange. 
That 
African-American 
judge, the pace was set for her by Ada 
Fisher. If you drop by and visit it 
today, you would bump into Bernard 
Jones, that African-American judge 
who serves there for the Western Dis-
trict of Oklahoma. The pace was set for 
him by Ada Fisher decades before. 
Quite frankly, we can’t even fathom, 
in this current time period, how dif-
ferent things really are, but it is inter-
esting to notice that time period and 
that generation and some ladies who 
really stood up and made a difference 
in Oklahoma because at the same time 
that Ada was at Langston University, 
another lady named Clara was at 
Langston University. 
We know her affectionately in Okla-
homa as Clara Luper. Now, some folks 
may not know Clara Luper’s name, but 
they know what she did. Clara Luper 
was at Langston University as well in 
the early 1940s. She finished her study, 
got her bachelor’s degree there, went 
and got a master’s degree, and contin-
ued on through the process. She be-
came the Youth Council leader for the 
NAACP in 1957, and in 1958 she helped 
her students—her youth whom she 
worked with—do a really, really rad-
ical thing to deal with segregation in 
Oklahoma. She talked about non-
violence, and she talked about how to 
step out and take a stand. She and a 
group of kids went to Katz Drug Store 
in Oklahoma City and sat down at the 
counter and ordered Cokes. And they 
sat there all day, never being served— 
all day. It was the birth nationwide of 
what we know of as the sit-in move-
ment, where young men and women 
who were African American would go 
and sit down at a place and just wait to 
be served. It started a movement that 
shook the Nation into this issue of seg-
regation. Those two ladies made a re-
markable change for the better in our 
history: Clara Luper and what she did; 
Ada Fisher and what she did. 
As we look back on tomorrow, Fred-
erick Douglass’s birthday, and we cele-
brate 
February 
as 
Black 
History 
Month, we realize how much history 
has really happened around us—just in 
the past 100 years even. We can go back 
as far as we want to and talk about the 
great Frederick Douglass and the influ-
ence he had on Abraham Lincoln and 
the influence he had on the Nation. 
Quite frankly, in Oklahoma, there 
are Black leaders today who are mak-
ing history, and 50 years from now and 
100 years from now we will be talking 
about them like we talk about Clara 
Luper and like we talk about Ada Fish-
er. 
We will be, 100 years from now, still 
talking about Russell Perry and the 
business work that he and his son 
Kevin have done in radio, what they 
have done in real estate, and what they 
have done in leadership in our State. 
Russell Perry was a barrier breaker. He 
was a cabinet member for a Governor. 
He has been a great leader and is a 
great leader in our State. 
We will still be talking, years and 
years from now, of Dr. Kent Smith, the 
current president of Langston Univer-
sity, and what he has done at Langston 
and the leadership model that he has in 
our State. 
For years, we will be talking about 
the members of the 1921 Race Massacre 
Commission 
and 
those 
individuals 
around 
Tulsa 
who 
have 
gathered 
around to say: What are we doing to 
help bring a community together and 
break down the barriers of segregation 
and of racism that still exist? 
We will be talking for years about 
Hannibal Johnson. He is a lawyer and a 
brilliant man, a historian, and a leader 
in his community. 
We will be talking for years about 
Wayland Cuban, an Oklahoma City po-
lice officer and a person who has spent 
a tremendous amount of time helping 
those around him and helping youth, 
especially those in trouble, to have a 
radical turnaround. 
We will talk for years about Terry 
Munday and what he has done on the 
radio. 
We will talk for years about pastors 
scattered all over our State that, in 
the 
African-American 
community,

have made a very real difference in the 
lives of a lot of families. 
We will talk for years, quite frankly, 
about Dr. Lester Shaw and what he has 
done at A Pocket Full of Hope and how 
he has helped so many kids. He has, for 
years, mentored students and has had a 
100-percent success rate, year after 
year after year, of just loving on kids 
and helping them in every way he can. 
Dr. Shaw has made a remarkable dif-
ference in our State. 
We will talk for years about Clarence 
Hill and about what he has done for 
race relations in our State and how he 
is quietly bringing people together to 
sit down around a dinner table and de-
velop friendships that should have ex-
isted long ago. 
We will talk for years about Stephan 
Moore and his family, what they have 
done in the inner city, what they have 
done to pull kids out and look at them 
eyeball to eyeball and give them a 
sense of hope and a sense of joy. 
See, in our State and around my city, 
Oklahoma City, where Frederick Doug-
lass High School is, February is not 
just another month. We understand 
what Black history really means be-
cause we are living it with legacy-leav-
ers like Ada Fisher and Clara Luper 
and so many others who have left such 
a mark. 
I am proud to say I have neighbors 
and friends all around me who continue 
to make history in what they continue 
to do in our State. I am grateful to call 
them friends, and I am grateful we 
have the opportunity to celebrate 
Frederick 
Douglass’s 
birthday 
to-
gether. 
I yield back. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). Without objection, 
it is so ordered. 
MAKE CENTS ACT 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, there is 
really no way to sugarcoat it. Washing-
ton’s budget process is broken. Every 
year, it is like clockwork. First, the 
President submits his budget, like we 
saw this past Monday. Then the House 
tears it up—no pun intended, really. 
They ultimately fail to pass their own 
budget, and then Congress kicks the 
can down the road before finally cram-
ming through a budget-busting bill at 
the eleventh hour. 
There is no question this process is 
dysfunctional, but maybe, more impor-
tantly, its lack of transparency allows 
for wasteful spending to continue year 
after year—unchecked. 
Folks, this cycle has to end. We have 
to start chipping away at this bal-
looning debt, and we have to work to-
ward cutting our government’s most 
wasteful spending. 
One of the best ways to do this is to 
call it out when we see it. As some of 
you may know, every month, I give out 
my Squeal Award to call out the parts 
of our government that are wasting 
hard-working Americans’ tax dollars. I 
highlight the most egregious waste 
found within the bowels of Washington, 
and then I put it forward and offer up 
a solution to stop it. 
Take, for example, what I like to call 
the binge buying bureaucrats. Every 
year at the end of September, the bu-
reaucrats charge billions of dollars to 
taxpayers during Washington’s annual 
use-it-or-lose-it 
spending 
spree. 
We 
have seen the compulsive buying in-
clude items like millions and millions 
of dollars of lobster and crab. We have 
even seen spending on games and toys 
or even on something like a $12,000 
foosball table. Is that what we need in 
Washington, DC—foosball? 
I have also called out Washington’s 
boondoggles that are just bottomless 
money pits for projects that never real-
ly even get off the ground. As for the 
contractors who are working on these 
boondoggles, the ones who are failing 
at their jobs, guess what—they are get-
ting big, fat bonuses. 
A primary example of this egregious 
misuse of tax dollars is what I like to 
call the moondoggle. Right there. 
There you have it. Look at that—the 
moondoggle. I am talking about the 
rockets that are being developed for 
NASA’s 
next 
Moon 
mission. 
This 
project is billions of dollars over budg-
et and years—folks, not months but 
years—behind schedule due to poor per-
formance. Yet NASA still handed out 
generous bonuses that totaled over $300 
million to the contractor who is work-
ing on the project. 
Folks, it is absurd. This is absurd. We 
have to put an end to it, and thank-
fully I believe we might actually be on 
a path that will do that. 
Taxpayers should be encouraged that 
all of this ‘‘squealing’’ has finally been 
heard at the other end of Pennsylvania 
Avenue. Both of these Squeal Award 
recipients—the binge buying bureau-
crats and the infamous moondoggle— 
have been targeted by President Trump 
in his latest budget proposal. 
Within its pages, the President states 
that his administration is committed 
to 
stopping 
improper 
end-of-year 
spending and will begin closely scruti-
nizing how money is being spent at the 
end of the fiscal year to curtail waste. 
The President’s budget also calls out 
the poor performance of the NASA con-
tractor and proposes management im-
provements that would shave $300 mil-
lion off the cost of the mission. This is 
encouraging, no doubt about it. 
In order to codify these efforts, I am 
putting forward a package of common-
sense reforms to join the President in 
urging Congress to actually address 
Washington’s spending addiction, get 
our budget process back on track, and 
ensure Iowans understand exactly how 
their hard-earned dollars are being 
spent. 
In order to force Congress to do its 
job and become a better steward of tax-
payers’ money, I have introduced the 
MAKE CENTS Act. This comprehen-
sive package combines five simple 
ideas I have previously introduced. 
First off, it requires an annual report 
listing 
every 
government-funded 
project that is $1 billion or more over 
budget or 5 years or more behind sched-
ule. 
Second, it requires every project sup-
ported with Federal funds to include a 
pricetag that is easily available for 
taxpayers. 
Third, it eliminates use-it-or-lose-it 
impulse purchases by limiting an agen-
cy’s spending in the last 2 months of 
the fiscal year to no more than the av-
erage spent in the other months. 
Fourth, it prohibits Congress from 
going on recess without passing a budg-
et on time. 
Fifth and lastly, it prohibits Con-
gress from getting paid without its 
passing a budget on time. 
Folks, these are not new or radical 
reforms. Many folks in the Senate and 
in the House have proposed various 
versions of these items, recognizing the 
serious problem we face. Like the bill 
title reads, these ideas just make 
sense. If hard-working Iowa families 
have to manage their budgets, we real-
ly should expect Washington to do the 
same. So let’s get at it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I ask

to 10 minutes each.

150TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEE 
COUNTY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today it is a privilege for me to join 
Kentuckians in Lee County in marking 
150 years of their distinguished history. 
Found in Eastern Kentucky, where tall 
hills meet dense forests, Lee County is 
home to a special rural heritage. I 
would like to spend a few moments 
today to look back at the area’s won-
derful traditions and to celebrate its 
great potential for the future. 
To fully understand Lee County’s 
history, we must appreciate its geog-
raphy. The county seat, Beattyville, 
sits at the birthplace of the beautiful 
Kentucky River. The Commonwealth’s

namesake waterway has historically 
provided Lee County residents a ship-
ping avenue and a scenic venue for out-
door recreation. Lush valleys led local 
farmers to grow a wide range of crops, 
including tobacco, corn, and apples. 
The Daniel Boone National Forest, 
which covers thousands of acres of the 
county, provides an abundant source of 
hardwood. Taking advantage of the 
beautiful Appalachian Mountains, coal 
operations in the county have been a 
historic aspect of this region. 
Formed in the years following the 
Civil War, Lee County did not take 
long to become a center of regional 
ground and water transportation. At 
the beginning of the 20th century, the 
Louisville and Atlantic Railroad ex-
tended its line to Beattyville, encour-
aging 
new 
opportunities 
for 
local 
growth. The following decades saw a 
strengthening economy and growing 
population. 
As the county developed, so did its 
rural traditions. One of them, the local 
Woolly Worm Festival, celebrates Lee 
County’s mountain culture. Each Octo-
ber, the community gathers for a vari-
ety of events, including a pet show, a 
parade, and a pageant. The most inter-
esting day is the Woolly Worm Races, 
where young people see whose banded 
woolly worm is the fastest to climb a 
string. The winning worm is given the 
responsibility of predicting that year’s 
upcoming winter based on its body’s 
coloration. This is just one example of 
the pride every Lee County resident 
can enjoy in their home county. 
I frequently get the chance to visit 
with families in Lee County and con-
sistently work to advance their prior-
ities in the Senate. For example, I have 
partnered with local officials to secure 
millions of Federal dollars to upgrade 
their water infrastructure and to build 
a hiking and mountain biking trail. It 
has also been a privilege to support the 
brave drug eradication efforts of law 
enforcement and the Kentucky Na-
tional Guard in the Daniel Boone Na-
tional Forest. Answering the call of 
Kentuckians is one of the best aspects 
of my service in the Senate, and I look 
forward to continuing to deliver for 
communities in Lee County and across 
Kentucky. 
Lee County will kick off its year of 
festivities on March 1, the same day 
the county was established in 1870. In 
addition to many community events, 
the county is also presenting an oral 
history project, featuring community 
members discussing local artifacts and 
historical events. There is certainly a 
lot to celebrate about the last 150 
years. I am delighted to join all the 
families throughout Lee County in 
marking this impressive milestone, 
and I urge my Senate colleagues to join 
me in paying tribute to this wonderful 
Eastern Kentucky community. 
f 
S.J. RES. 68 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier 
today, we voted on an amendment to 
S.J. Res. 68 that was offered by the 
chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, 
Senator 
RISCH. 
That 
amendment consisted of one sentence, 
as follows: ‘‘The President has a con-
stitutional responsibility to take ac-
tions to defend the United States, its 
territories, possessions, citizens, serv-
icemembers and diplomats from at-
tack.’’ 
On its face, the Risch amendment 
seems reasonable. The President does 
have a responsibility to defend the 
country. But, as is so often the case, 
the devil is in the details, or the ab-
sence of details, and when it involves 
engaging U.S. Armed Forces in hos-
tilities, we should pay particularly 
close attention. I was among those who 
opposed the amendment and I want to 
explain why. 
First, it is important to note that the 
underlying resolution already states 
that ‘‘[nothing] in this section shall be 
construed to prevent the United States 
from defending itself from imminent 
attack.’’ So there is no question about 
the President’s authority to defend the 
country. But the central purpose of the 
resolution is to give meaning to the 
Congress’s constitutional authority— 
the Congress’s sole power—to declare 
war. For far too long this body has sur-
rendered that duty to the executive 
branch. 
In 2002, when the Senate considered 
whether or not to authorize President 
George W. Bush to invade Iraq, many 
in this body argued that providing the 
President with that authority was 
needed to convince Saddam Hussein to 
back down. I, instead, saw it as Con-
gress 
abdicating 
its 
constitutional 
duty by providing the President with 
open-ended authority to use military 
force against Iraq. For that reason, 
among others, I voted no. 
In fact, my worst fears were realized. 
Not only was the justification for that 
war based on lies, but thousands of 
Americans died, trillions of dollars 
were wasted that could have been used 
to fix what’s broken in this country, 
and the American people are no safer. 
Today that authority is being used in 
ways that no one envisioned or in-
tended to justify an attack against an-
other country, Iran, nearly two decades 
later. 
We should learn from that costly 
mistake. The obvious implication of 
the Risch amendment is that any 
President is authorized, and has an af-
firmative responsibility, to use mili-
tary force at anytime, anywhere, in-
definitely, to prevent an unspecified 
attack that might occur sometime in 
the future. There is no requirement 
that it be ‘‘imminent’’. There is no re-
quirement that such an attack be any-
thing other than speculative or imag-
ined. 
Given the way this and past adminis-
trations have expansively interpreted 
past authorizations for the use of force, 
the Risch amendment could be inter-
preted to further erode Congress’s abil-
ity to prevent a President from unilat-
erally sending U.S. forces into hos-
tilities 
without 
prior 
consultation 
with, or further authorization from, 
the Congress. Such an endorsement— 
even if unintended—of unchecked Exec-
utive power undermines the purpose of 
the underlying joint resolution, and it 
makes a mockery of the Congress’s sole 
power to declare war. That is not some-
thing any of us should condone. 
f 
THE CLEAN ECONOMY ACT 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I 
rise to discuss solutions to the climate 
crisis, which threatens the health and 
well-being of my constituents in Mary-
land and Americans across the Nation. 
The urgency of climate change asks 
us to be our most cooperative and col-
laborative selves and to seek policy so-
lutions that far outlast our legacies in 
office. As the threat of climate change 
becomes more and more visible to the 
American public, people are demanding 
action from their Federal Government. 
This year, we have seen an unprece-
dented level of interest from Ameri-
cans of all ages and walks of life on 
real solutions to this complex problem. 
A variety of comprehensive solutions 
have been proposed, some that rep-
resent a departure from how the Fed-
eral Government has addressed climate 
change in the past, while others utilize 
existing Federal frameworks to drive 
climate action. 
History tells us that our Federal 
agencies have an incredible capacity to 
evolve to meet the threats of their 
time. In previous administrations, the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
has been a dynamic steward of domes-
tic environmental law throughout the 
last half-century and is well-practiced 
in addressing environmental concerns 
as they emerge. Unfortunately, Con-
gress and the President have failed to 
provide the EPA with the direction and 
funding it needs to address the issue of 
climate change in earnest. I support 
Senator CARPER’s Clean Economy Act 
for this very reason. The Clean Econ-
omy Act understands that the EPA lies 
at the center of America’s climate fu-
ture and empowers it to address cli-
mate change proactively. 
The Clean Economy Act provides the 
agency with the clear goal of net-zero 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to 
match the urgency to reduce warming 
global temperatures. The Intergovern-
mental Panel on Climate Change’s— 
IPCC—October 2018 Special Report on 
climate warns that warming above 1.5 
degrees Celsius above pre-industrial 
levels will have a catastrophic impact 
on our global systems. The United 
States reaching net-zero is an essential 
component to keep global temperature 
warming below the 1.5 degrees Celsius 
cap. 
Many of this administration’s nomi-
nees are fond of pointing out that they 
are not scientists, implying that they 
are not qualified to make decisions re-
lated to climate change. I will point 
out that most of us are not economists

either, but that doesn’t stop us from 
making decisions that affect the econ-
omy. We have a responsibility to make 
informed decisions affecting our cli-
mate, environment, and natural re-
sources, which are at the heart of our 
ability to maintain a healthy sustain-
able economy. There are some tough 
decisions to make in the face of cli-
mate change that reasonable people 
will disagree about, but the basic 
science should not be ignored. Whether 
to accept the facts of the matter 
should not be a partisan debate. 
Fortunately, the IPCC, to which the 
U.S. Government and scientific com-
munity is a leading contributor, con-
tinues to provide a well-documented 
guide for what we need to do to respond 
to the climate crisis. According to the 
IPCC’s landmark Special Report on 
Global Warming of 1.5°C, the model 
pathways that would enable us to limit 
global warming to the critical bench-
mark of 1.5°C above pre-industrial lev-
els reach net zero global net anthropo-
genic CO2 emissions by approximately 
2050.This bill is based on the science 
that demonstrates the importance and 
value of reaching net-zero greenhouse 
gas emissions by not later than 2050. 
We can do this, and making the nec-
essary 
investments 
to 
do 
so 
will 
strengthen our economy, create jobs, 
and protect our public health and na-
tional security. The most expensive 
and unrealistic course of action is to 
ignore the mounting costs of climate 
change and fail to respond. 
The legislation ensures that the 
EPA’s plan incorporates greenhouse 
gas reduction, while expanding oppor-
tunities for the U.S. labor force. After 
all, any conversation about a new U.S. 
energy future without the participa-
tion of working people is incomplete. 
The Clean Economy Act ensures the 
EPA has the power to invest in the de-
velopment and deployment of low- and 
zero-greenhouse 
gas 
emitting 
tech-
nologies and that the U.S. workforce 
reaps the benefits of an equitable tran-
sition away from fossil fuels. The sup-
port of the Blue Green Alliance, a coa-
lition of labor unions like the United 
Steelworkers and the Utility Workers 
Union of America and environmental 
organizations like the League of Con-
servation 
Voters 
and 
Natural 
Re-
sources Defense Council demonstrates 
that a diverse collection of interests 
see a net-zero future for our country. 
This legislation builds off bipartisan 
progress we have made this Congress 
using existing Federal frameworks to 
reduce emissions and prepare for the 
effects of climate change that are al-
ready here. In November 2018, the 
Fourth National Climate Assessment 
concluded that climate change is af-
fecting the natural environment, agri-
culture, energy production and use, 
land and water resources, transpor-
tation, and human health and welfare 
across the U.S. and its territories.’’ 
The Senate Environment and Public 
Works Committee favorably reported 
the American’s Transportation Infra-
structure Act in July 2019 that for the 
first time included a Climate Title. 
The Federal assistance in it will help 
the transportation sector lower emis-
sions through infrastructure for elec-
tric and alternatively fueled vehicles. 
The bill also supports States and local 
agencies preparing our Nation’s roads 
and 
bridges 
to 
withstand 
climate 
impacts. 
I encourage my colleagues across 
committees to work together to enact 
both pieces of legislation to prepare all 
sectors of the clean economy for the 
climate reality before us today. 
One of the most critical climate 
change impacts that we must take im-
mediate action on is the threat to our 
water infrastructure. This week, GAO 
is releasing a report on water infra-
structure and climate change in re-
sponse to a request I made with my 
colleague 
Senator 
SHELDON
WHITE-
HOUSE of Rhode Island. We asked the 
GAO to study what is known about the 
effects of climate change on the Na-
tion’s domestic water systems and the 
potential fiscal risks posed by those ef-
fects and evaluate Federal actions that 
may be taken to reduce such risks. 
Therein, EPA estimates that drink-
ing water and wastewater utilities need 
to invest almost $744 billion to repair 
and replace their existing infrastruc-
ture over the next 20 years. GAO finds 
climate change is increasing these 
costs. In 2017, it cost the Federal Gov-
ernment over $300 billion to repair 
damage resulting from climate- and 
weather-related events, including dam-
age to drinking water and wastewater 
infrastructure, according to NOAA. 
The faster we act to make our water 
infrastructure 
resilient 
to 
climate 
change impacts, as well as address the 
root cause of climate change through 
legislation such as the Clean Economy 
Act, the better we can reduce the risks 
and control the costs. Our drinking 
water and wastewater treatment sys-
tems are at great risk from climate 
change impacts such as heavy rainfall, 
sea level rise, and flooding that local 
managers are experiencing today. 
The GAO report shows a path toward 
minimizing future damage. This study 
documents the need for the Federal 
Government to work with States and 
local utilities to strengthen the resil-
ience of water infrastructure to cli-
mate impacts and makes practical sug-
gestions that we should implement im-
mediately through incorporating cli-
mate effects into infrastructure plan-
ning and providing enhanced technical 
and financial assistance. 
My 
colleague 
Senator 
SHELLEY 
MOORE CAPITO of West Virginia and I 
introduced S. 2636, the Clean Water In-
frastructure Resilience and Sustain-
ability Act to prepare our publicly 
owned wastewater treatment facilities 
for the impacts of climate change. 
These efforts will work in tandem with 
the goals of the Clean Economy Act to 
seek net-zero emissions while pre-
venting further damage to our national 
infrastructure by the extreme weather 
events we are already seeing. 
The Clean Economy Act directs the 
EPA to coordinate with other Federal 
agencies to encourage the restoration 
of ecosystems such as forests and wet-
lands that sequester carbon and im-
prove climate resilience, particularly 
on Federal and Tribal land. 
The fight to reduce the greenhouse 
gases that cause climate change is not 
unlike the challenge we face in clean-
ing up and restoring water quality in 
the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers and 
streams. Many of the solutions, such as 
restoring natural carbons sinks like 
wetlands, are the same. Wetlands act 
like natural sponges, storing excess 
carbon in soils, as well as soaking up 
stormwater and trapping pollutants be-
fore they reach rivers, streams, and the 
Chesapeake Bay. 
The original Chesapeake Bay Agree-
ment was a simple, one-page pledge 
signed in 1983 recognizing that a coop-
erative approach was necessary to ad-
dress the bay’s pollution problems. The 
1987 Chesapeake Bay Agreement set the 
first numeric goals to reduce pollution 
and restore the bay ecosystem. Today, 
the EPA-led Chesapeake Bay Program 
partnership engages dozens of agencies 
and organizations in the effort to re-
store the bay and its rivers. I am en-
couraged to see a number of the agen-
cies named in section 2 of the Clean 
Economy Act are Federal agency part-
ners, including the National Oceanic 
and 
Atmospheric 
Administration— 
NOAA—U.S. Department of Defense— 
DOD—and U.S. Department of the Inte-
rior—DOI. 
This 
body 
recently 
unanimously 
passed proposals I authored that will 
benefit the Chesapeake Bay watershed 
and wetlands nationwide. Foremost 
was a provision increasing the EPA 
Chesapeake Bay Program Reauthoriza-
tion to a historic $92 million. The bills 
were part of a bipartisan package of 
wildlife conservation legislation, the 
America’s 
Conservation 
Enhance-
ment—ACE—Act. The ACE Act served 
as a substitute amendment for the 
North America Wetlands Conservation 
Extension 
Act—NAWCA—which 
pro-
vides grants to protect wetlands. 
We have demonstrated our ability to 
respond legislatively to challenges that 
seemed insurmountable 30 years ago. I 
urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor 
this new consensus bill.

SOUTH SUDAN 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to express strong concern about 
the situation in South Sudan and to 
call on the administration to step up 
its diplomatic efforts to avert a return 
to conflict and help achieve a lasting 
peace. For 6 years, the people of South 
Sudan have suffered the effects of a 
brutal civil war. International efforts 
to find a diplomatic solution have 
failed, and the humanitarian situation 
in South Sudan remains one of the 
worst in the world. 
In September 2018, President Salva 
Kiir and his main political opponent,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1069 
February 13, 2020 
former Vice President Riek Machar, 
agreed to form a unity government in 
the capital, Juba, by March of 2019. 
Though this so called ‘‘revitalized 
agreement’’ is not perfect, it is what 
we have to work with. The ceasefire be-
tween Kiir and Machar that was part of 
it has largely held, sparing the South 
Sudanese from the violence and bru-
tality so many experienced at the 
height of the civil war. I am also en-
couraged that the government and po-
litical opposition groups that had re-
fused to sign the 2018 revitalized peace 
deal reached an accord last month. 
However, two successive delays in 
the establishment of the unity govern-
ment have made me skeptical about 
the chances that the latest deadline, 
February 22, will be met. While both 
parties have stated their commitment 
to it, they have yet to effectively ad-
dress two fundamental sticking points: 
the boundaries of South Sudan’s states, 
and the formation of an inclusive na-
tional army. Absent an agreement on 
these two issues, lasting peace may 
prove elusive. 
At the end of the day, Kiir, Machar, 
and others who claim to represent the 
South Sudanese people are responsible 
for peace in their country. However, 
given our historical role in South 
Sudan, the United States has a signifi-
cant role to play. I would like to re-
mind my colleagues that the United 
States 
was 
heavily 
involved 
in 
brokering 
the 
2005 
Comprehensive 
Peace Agreement which helped create 
the conditions for South Sudan’s inde-
pendence. 
Since 
independence, 
the 
United States has provided nearly $3.8 
billion in emergency humanitarian as-
sistance since the outbreak of civil 
war. We have supported the UN peace-
keeping 
force 
in 
South 
Sudan, 
UNMISS, which is protecting 200,000 ci-
vilians sheltering in or near its bases, 
investing more than $342 million last 
fiscal year. These dollars are and have 
contributed to keeping thousands of 
people alive. But the South Sudanese 
deserve more than mere life support. 
They deserve to live in peace. We have 
influence with all of the key actors in 
the region, yet the administration has 
failed to use it. The administration 
must effectively use its influence to 
help the millions of South Sudanese 
who aspired to liberty but found mis-
ery instead. 
Previous 
administrations 
made 
South Sudan a priority in their foreign 
policy. The Bush administration helped 
negotiate the aforementioned Com-
prehensive 
Peace 
Agreement. 
The 
Obama administration help shepherd 
the country to independence and re-
mained actively engaged as the secu-
rity and humanitarian situation de-
volved. 
At his confirmation hearing, Assist-
ant Secretary of State for Africa Tibor 
Nagy promised that under his leader-
ship, ‘‘The South Sudanese will realize 
just how involved the United States 
is.’’ 
However, administration engagement 
has been weak and inconsistent, and it 
is not guided by a clearly articulated 
strategy. In May 2018, the White House 
announced it was conducting a review 
of our assistance programs to South 
Sudan. In a statement, it expressed 
frustration that, ‘‘the leaders of this 
country have squandered this partner-
ship, pilfered the wealth of South 
Sudan, killed their own people, and re-
peatedly demonstrated their inability 
and unwillingness to live up to their 
commitments to end the country’s 
civil war’’—a bold statement but it has 
been more than a year and a half since 
the review was announced, and it re-
mains incomplete. Since that time, 
what has the administration done? 
Well, 3 years into the administration, 
it has finally designated a special 
envoy, something for which I have been 
advocating for years, but the envoy 
will not answer directly to the Presi-
dent or the Secretary of State, which I 
fear may limit his stature and, there-
fore, his effectiveness. 
Additionally, the administration has 
imposed targeted sanctions. Last year, 
the Treasury Department sanctioned 
two Cabinet ministers, Elia Lomuro 
and Kuol Manyang Juuk. Last month, 
they also sanctioned South Sudan’s 
First Vice President Taban Deng Gai. 
Deng is credibly accused of influencing 
the government to execute to dis-
sidents; he should be sanctioned for 
human rights abuses. But, as I have 
said many times before, sanctions are 
not a strategy. Sanctions are a tool to 
be used selectively to apply pressure 
towards a specific political goal. In 
this case, support for a comprehensive 
and durable peace agreement. 
Last month, a year and a half since 
his confirmation, Ambassador Nagy 
visited Juba. While I applaud Ambas-
sador Nagy’s trip—I believe that the 
U.S. should be increasing its diplo-
matic engagement—one visit does not 
a policy make. It is unclear what the 
trip was meant to accomplish in the 
absence of a comprehensive strategy. 
At this critical juncture, I am still 
hard pressed to understand the admin-
istration’s approach towards South 
Sudan, and I am worried that we do not 
have a plan of action should this latest 
deadline not be met. Time is of the es-
sence; I urge the administration to 
take several actions. 
First, ensure that Special Envoy Sy-
mington has the appropriate staff and 
resources to effectively undertake his 
responsibilities. 
The 
administration 
has moved from no envoys for Sudan 
and South Sudan to two envoys. While 
the challenges in the two countries are 
different, the fates of the two countries 
remain intertwined. Coordination is 
critical, as is support for both of their 
offices. 
Second, we must have a sound strat-
egy for supporting a viable peace 
agreement. I call upon Special Envoy 
Symington to take immediate steps to 
develop an interagency strategy, in 
consultation with our Ambassadors in 
the region, aimed at uniting the region 
to apply pressure to the parties to ad-
dress outstanding obstacles to the for-
mation of a unity government. In the 
short term, the strategy should focus 
on developing benchmarks and mile-
stones towards formation of a unity 
government, and steps—to include pu-
nitive measures—the United States 
will take to encourage regional part-
ners to apply consistent pressure on 
the parties to the conflict to move to-
wards peace. Longer term, it should 
lead 
towards 
supporting 
conditions 
that support a sustainable peace and 
credible elections. The strategy should 
also include actions to support grass-
roots reconciliation and restorative 
justice, as well as accountability for 
war crimes and human rights abuses. 
Finally, the administration must 
conclude its review of assistance to 
South Sudan and be transparent to the 
South Sudanese, members of the diplo-
matic community, and the American 
people about exactly what the next 
steps will be relative to its findings and 
how those steps fit into a broader 
strategy. Whatever these steps are, 
they should be aimed towards cement-
ing peace, and continuing strong sup-
port for development and humanitarian 
assistance to the people of South 
Sudan. 
If past is prologue, South Sudan’s 
leaders may well once again fail their 
people. The stakes for the formation of 
a unity government—one that can im-
plement a durable peace—are peril-
ously high. If the current negotiations 
collapse, millions will suffer. We must 
do all we can to ensure that the South 
Sudanese are able to move forward 
with this agreement, flawed though it 
may well be, and we must be prepared 
to help it succeed.

TRIBUTE TO IYAD SHIHADEH 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize and pay tribute 
to a valued and long-standing member 
of my staff, Iyad Shihadeh. After near-
ly 9 years of serving the people of Cali-
fornia in my San Francisco office, to-
morrow will be Iyad’s last day. 
Iyad first joined my team in 2011 as a 
staff assistant and quickly made an im-
pression through his diligent efforts on 
behalf of the Californians calling or 
visiting our office. Iyad was quickly 
promoted to the position of constituent 
services representative, where he man-
aged as many as 200 casework requests 
simultaneously between the Depart-
ments of State, Justice, and Homeland 
Security. 
Iyad demonstrated an aptitude for 
problem solving on behalf of individ-
uals and organizations needing help 
navigating the Federal bureaucracy. 
Additionally, Iyad took charge of the 
office’s intern program, guiding the 
dozens of students each year working 
in the San Francisco office. Many of 
our former State interns and staff are 
indebted to him for his thoughtful ca-
reer advice as they made their first for-
ays into the field of public service. 
In 2017, Iyad was promoted again to 
be the director of constituent services,

in charge of a team of staff who re-
ceive, process, and advocate for the 
casework needs of Californians seeking 
assistance from Federal agencies. I 
have depended on Iyad’s sound judg-
ment, management capabilities, and 
cool head in this critical function. 
As all Senators know, your casework 
director needs to be a special person. 
They represent you to constituents 
who are in need and often have no-
where else to turn. I have been particu-
larly lucky to have Iyad in this role; he 
has performed with skill and with a 
deft personal touch. 
I am proud of our casework successes 
under Iyad’s management in recovering 
millions of dollars in benefits for those 
needing help with Social Security 
checks, student loans, tax refunds, vet-
erans’ benefits, and other payments 
from the Federal Government. He has 
worked on behalf of countless constitu-
ents seeking visas or other immigra-
tion benefits. When a constituent is in 
a foreign jail or has lost their passport 
overseas, Iyad has been on the case, 
immediately, professionally, and suc-
cessfully. 
I am particularly thankful for Iyad’s 
help with Maria Mendoza, a nurse from 
Oakland who is back in the United 
States with her children after Iyad’s 
work in securing an H1–B visa; also 
Maria Isabel Bueso, a young woman 
from Guatemala who has lived in the 
United States for most of her life in 
order to receive lifesaving medication, 
but who was threatened last year with 
removal. Iyad worked with the family 
and with Judiciary Committee staff, 
and now, Isabel has been given a stay 
from deportation. 
In addition to his casework efforts, 
Iyad has provided guidance in my San 
Francisco office. His steady presence 
has been indispensable for three State 
directors and four chiefs of staff. 
Before joining my team, Iyad grad-
uated from Purdue University with a 
double major in history and political 
science in 2009. He received academic 
honors, graduating in the top 10 per-
cent of his class. Following his lifelong 
passion of international issues, he dedi-
cated himself to his studies and wrote 
a 
dissertation 
titled, 
‘‘They 
Also 
Served: The Untold Story of the Egyp-
tian Labour Corps in World War One.’’ 
In 2010, he graduated from the London 
School of Economics, where he re-
ceived a master of science in the his-
tory of empires. His efforts afforded 
him a deeper knowledge of economics 
and globalization, and once again, he 
centered his academic curiosities on 
foreign affairs by writing his thesis on 
‘‘Money, Arms, and Superpowers: Brit-
ish Foreign Policy towards the War of 
Attrition.’’ 
While I am sad to see him go, I am 
thrilled for Iyad’s family as he will join 
them in the day-to-day management of 
their restaurant in south San Fran-
cisco. His energy, ideas, and ability to 
connect with people will undoubtedly 
serve his family and community well 
for many years to come. I am deeply 
grateful for the wisdom and dedication 
that Iyad Shihadeh has brought to our 
office and his dedication on behalf of 
the people of California. I thank Iyad 
and wish him all the best in his future 
endeavors.

TRIBUTE TO BETH BURKE 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to recognize a loss for the 
Murray office and a major victory for 
Wisconsin and that is the return of 
Beth Burke, a longtime and deeply 
trusted aide of mine, to her home State 
after 8 years with my office. 
Over her time with us, Beth saw me 
through office move after office move, 
countless hectic days of running to and 
from the Capitol all without missing a 
vote, I should say and more rebooked 
flights back to Washington State than 
sure she would like to remember. 
All of that would be enough to keep 
a team of ordinary people busy, but it 
doesn’t even scratch the surface of 
what Beth has meant to me, to our 
team, and to our country because, dur-
ing those same years of Beth’s service, 
she helped lead our team as we grew 
from scrappy and small to still scrap-
py, but spanning three different office 
buildings in the Senate, in addition to 
our two coast, as I negotiated a bipar-
tisan budget agreement no one thought 
we could get done and through the ne-
gotiations between Chairman Alex-
ander and me on reforming K–12 edu-
cation to end No Child Left Behind. 
She was up at all hours, all week, 
every week, doing everything she could 
to advance our efforts to fight for pa-
tients’ healthcare, for women’s repro-
ductive rights and equality, and al-
ways, always for our servicemembers, 
veterans, and their families. 
It is a bit of a truism that the loudest 
voice in the room is not always the one 
having the biggest impact. Now, Beth 
will be the first to admit that she has 
a loud voice. But she used it and her 
expertise at navigating every logistic 
and obstacle imaginable to ensure we 
were in the best possible position to 
succeed in whatever we set out to do. 
She is a true public servant with the 
biggest heart you can imagine, and I 
know families and communities in 
Washington State and nationwide are 
better for her time here. 
I would also be remiss if I didn’t note 
that Beth met her wonderful husband 
Dan, got married, and had her ador-
able, fierce baby girl Lillian all while 
she worked in our office. 
It has been a true joy seeing her fam-
ily grow, so before I close I want to 
thank 
Beth’s 
family—Dan, 
Lillian, 
their dog Karl—the most important 
Burke and everyone who’s excited to 
welcome her home to Wisconsin, for 
sharing Beth with us. 
I know it is not always easy having a 
Senate staffer as a spouse or a family 
member or a close friend, especially 
one who works as hard and cares as 
much as Beth, so I want to recognize 
all your loved ones for their service as 
well. 
Beth, thank you again from my State 
and my family to yours. We are so 
deeply grateful for you and so excited 
to hear about everything you have in 
store.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING MARIE 
GREENWOOD 
∑ Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Marie 
Greenwood, who passed away late last 
year at the age of 106 years old. Marie, 
a teacher by trade, spent her life dedi-
cated to the idea that each child—re-
gardless of their race, gender, or 
class—deserves a quality education. 
Her intellect, compassion, and vigor 
propelled countless children through 
the Denver Public School system and 
towards lives of purpose. Marie’s work 
as Denver’s first tenured Black teacher 
and an integration pioneer increased 
educational equity in our schools and 
helped shape Denver into the great city 
that it is today. 
An only child, Marie was born in Los 
Angeles in 1912 before she and her fam-
ily relocated to Denver in 1925. As a 
Black family in segregated Denver, 
they faced no shortage of obstacles. De-
spite being a star student who time and 
again overcame the bigotry leveled 
against her, Marie was told by her high 
school guidance counselor not to apply 
to college because it would be a waste 
of her parents’ money. Thank goodness 
Marie did not heed this wrongheaded 
advice. She went on to graduate third 
in her class and earned a scholarship to 
Colorado Teachers College. Marie had 
set out on a path that would eventually 
lead to touching the lives of genera-
tions of Colorado’s students. 
Marie was a trailblazer in civil rights 
and the ideal teacher. In 1938, she 
earned tenure in the Denver Public 
Schools, the first Black teacher to do 
so. Throughout the 1940s, Marie was in-
volved in local activism that chal-
lenged discriminatory policies. In 1955, 
Marie made history again when she be-
came the first African American in 
Denver to teach at a segregated school. 
In the 1960s, she served on a Denver 
Public Schools committee tasked to 
study racial inequities in district fund-
ing and staffing. All the while, she was 
a kind and determined teacher who en-
sured that her students always tried 
their hardest. 
In retirement, she authored two 
books, one outlining her philosophy on 
teaching children facing difficulties 
and the other her autobiography. In 
2001, her legacy was further solidified 
as the school district named a new ele-
mentary school in her honor. She will 
continue to be remembered by students 
who participate in the Greenwood 
Scholars program, which teaches the 
history of Denver through her life 
story. 
As the former superintendent of Den-
ver Public Schools, I can confidently

TRIBUTE TO ASHLEY KEMMIS AND 
BRIANNA PAGE 
∑ Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, this 
week I have the honor of recognizing 
Ashley Kemmis and Brianna Page for 
their entrepreneurial spirit in Valley 
County. 
Ashley and Brianna saw a need in the 
community for more options for wom-
en’s clothing after Shopko closed in 
Glasgow in 2019. 
They teamed up together to launch 
Thistle and Thread, an online women’s 
clothing boutique. Since they launched 
their website one year ago, Ashley and 
Brianna’s project flourished into a suc-
cessful operation out of Eastern Mon-
tana. 
Women across the country can pur-
chase the boutique’s clothing online 
and those in eastern Montana can visit 
their storefront in Glasgow. 
It is my honor to recognize Ashley 
and Brianna for taking the initiative 
to successfully launch Thistle and 
Thread. Thistle and Thread is a now a 
proud part of the Glasgow community, 
and I am grateful for Ashley and 
Brianna’s entrepreneurship.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO JERRIANNE BOGGIS 
AND VALERIE CUNNINGHAM 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize JerriAnne Boggis of 
Milford and Valerie Cunningham of 
Portsmouth 
as 
February’s 
Granite 
Staters of the Month for their work to 
bring to light New Hampshire’s too 
often forgotten Black history and en-
gage communities across our State in 
conversations about New Hampshire’s 
full past. 
JerriAnne has said that it took 25 
years after emigrating from Jamaica 
to New Hampshire for her to discover 
that New Hampshire had a Black his-
tory. JerriAnne was surprised to learn 
that the town she lived in, Milford, was 
home to Harriet E. Wilson, one of the 
first 
African 
Americans 
in 
North 
America to publish a novel. To com-
memorate Harriet’s incredible achieve-
ment, JerriAnne established a non-
profit organization to erect a statue of 
Harriet, which also marked the first 
statue in New Hampshire to honor a 
person of color. 
Valerie 
grew 
up 
in 
Portsmouth, 
where her parents were leaders of the 
local civil rights movement and en-
couraged their daughter to explore New 
Hampshire’s Black history. Valerie fol-
lowed her parents’ encouragement and 
spent years documenting African and 
African-American 
history 
in 
New 
Hampshire. Valerie would later go on 
to create a physical embodiment of her 
decades of research by establishing the 
Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail in 
1995, with the intent of bringing public 
awareness to Portsmouth’s Black his-
tory. 
Today, the Portsmouth Black Herit-
age Trail has expanded to become the 
Black Heritage Trail of New Hamp-
shire. The foundation that Valerie 
founded is now led by JerriAnne, the 
trail’s executive director. JerriAnne is 
working to expand the organization’s 
mission to other towns across New 
Hampshire with the hope of growing 
public awareness of the Black history 
that exists in every region of the State. 
The Black Heritage Trail plays an 
important role in engaging Granite 
Staters about the complex topic of race 
in America. To help jumpstart these 
necessary conversations, the organiza-
tion hosts community dialogues, called 
Tea Talks, focused on discussing the 
intersection of race with different fac-
ets of American life, including health, 
education, and the arts. It also hosts a 
variety of events throughout the year, 
including the Black New England Con-
ference, held last year at Southern New 
Hampshire University. 
The Black Heritage Trail of New 
Hampshire brings a long overdue focus 
on our State’s Black history. African 
Americans in New Hampshire have 
made profound contributions to our 
State, and thanks in part to the work 
of JerriAnne and Valerie, these stories 
and achievements will be remembered 
in history. It is a great honor to recog-
nize the work of these women and their 
dedication to creating a more in-
formed, inclusive, and just New Hamp-
shire.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF STEVENS 
INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 
∑ Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I rise to recognize and congratu-
late Stevens Institute of Technology in 
Hoboken, NJ on the 150th anniversary 
of its founding. 
On February 15, 1870, Stevens Insti-
tute of Technology was founded as the 
first college of mechanical engineering 
in the United States, with a bequest 
from Edwin A. Stevens, a member of 
‘‘America’s first family of inventors.’’ 
Over the past 150 years, the university 
has expanded to include comprehensive 
academic offerings in a wide array of 
engineering and science discipline, and 
has an accredited School of Business 
and a College of Arts and Letters. 
From its earliest days, Stevens has 
honored its mission to inspire, nurture, 
and educate leaders in the technology- 
centric environment of the future, 
while equipping them with the tools to 
find innovative solutions to the most 
challenging problems of our time. 
Today Stevens is among the fastest 
growing universities in the Nation, at-
tracting top students and faculty from 
New Jersey, the Nation, and across the 
globe. 
Stevens is also one of the largest pro-
ducers of science, technology, engi-
neering and mathematics, STEM, de-
gree recipients in New Jersey and 
ranks first in the State and 15th in the 
Nation in the production of engineer-
ing graduate degrees. Students at Ste-
vens benefit from the university’s tech-
nology-centric education, which pro-
vides a unique and entrepreneurial ap-
proach to learning that encourages 
problem-solving and is a passport to 
success. Stevens has an outstanding 96 
percent placement rate for its grad-
uates, and its alumni have launched 
and led numerous companies and orga-
nizations. 
Stevens faculty, student, and alumni 
have pioneered research and innova-
tions in many diverse fields, including 
transportation, 
telecommunications, 
resiliency, sustainability, artificial in-
telligence, 
machine 
learning, 
healthcare, biomedicine, cybersecurity, 
maritime security, and systems engi-
neering. It is no exaggeration to say 
that Stevens has changed and improved 
the way we live, work, and commu-
nicate, greatly benefiting society. Ste-
vens has also contributed significantly 
to the community and local, State, and 
national economy. 
It is my great honor to recognize Ste-
vens for this significant milestone in 
the history of the university and to 
thank its leadership, faculty, students, 
and alumni for their profound and 
farreaching contributions to the com-
munities of Hoboken, Hudson County, 
the State of New Jersey, and to the 
United States.∑

REMEMBERING WESLEY AIKEN 
∑ Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
want to take a few minutes to recog-
nize the life of Ugiaqtaq Wesley Aiken, 
who died January 6, 2020 at the age 93 
years old, only 19 days shy of his 94th 
birthday. 
With the passing of Native elder Wes-
ley Aiken, Alaska has lost a highly re-
spected In˜ upiat leader who dedicated 
his life to leadership in the Alaska Na-
tive community and ensuring that cul-
tural and traditional knowledge will be 
passed down to younger generations. 
Wesley Aiken was born in 1926 in 
Utqiagvik, to a completely subsistence 
lifestyle north of the Arctic Circle. He 
grew up in a small village, Isuk. which 
lays east of Utqiagvik, until the age of 
12, moving for his education. As a teen-
ager, he became a reindeer header for 3 
years in order to help out his family. 
He was a man of many trades—he was 
a mechanic, laborer, member of the 
Alaska Territorial Guard, and later a 
member of the Alaska National Guard. 
He 
served 
as 
the 
land 
chief 
for 
Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation fol-
lowing its formation in 1973. He was a 
spiritual leader for the community and 
was always asked to pray. He would 
pray when the whale was caught, be-
fore big celebrations, the Nalukatak 
blanket toss, the Winter Games, and he 
prayed with the whaling captains. He 
loved the gatherings of the people and 
strived to see all the community’s chil-
dren participate. He was a hard worker

and would say, ‘‘If you have dreams to 
do something, you, yourself have to 
work hard to get to that goal.’’ 
Wesley grew up using dog teams in 
the wintertime to camp and hunt long 
before snow machines were prevalent 
and available in his region. His tradi-
tional knowledge of the subsistence 
lifestyle was extensive, and he enthu-
siastically shared with his community. 
He learned whaling from his grand-
father and uncle and later became a 
whaling captain. He took it upon him-
self to teach the next generation whal-
ing. His daughter’s generation was sent 
off to boarding schools, and so many 
youth were not taught the traditional 
ways of hunting and needed to be re-
taught when they returned. He taught 
many of his nephews traditional hunt-
ing methods and said it was his job to 
give back, just as his elders had taught 
him how to hunt whale and inland ani-
mals. He observed changes in sea ice 
and climate in his generation and 
shared with the world what he saw. 
Wesley also served on the North 
Slope Borough’s In˜ upiat History, Lan-
guage and Culture Commission. He 
often stressed the importance of lan-
guage, and his dream was an immer-
sion camp in which only Inupiat was 
spoke. He reminded the youth about 
the hardships their ancestors experi-
enced and that the whole community 
looked out for each other. And if you 
took care of animals and the land, they 
would take care of you. 
In 2018, he served as the keynote 
speaker at the Elders and Youth Con-
ference in Anchorage, during which he 
delivered a strong message on respect. 
He said it is all about respect. It is 
about respect for self and for one other, 
as well as a respect for the animals, 
which he said have spirits just like we 
do. In fact, when he took his daughter 
hunting, he taught her where to put a 
hole behind the neck to release the 
spirit of the caribou. 
Wesley was also known for his Alas-
ka Native rights activism. He partici-
pated in the 1961 Barrow Duck Sit-in, 
protesting the Federal Government’s 
regulation of Native hunting rights, 
and this protest, among others, led to 
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement 
Act. A respected leader, he also helped 
establish the Alaska Federal of Na-
tives. 
Elder Wesley’s wisdom and kindness 
will be missed. He is survived and re-
spected by his children, grandchildren, 
great-grandchildren, friends, and his 
whole community.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN PROCLAMATION 9844 
OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WITH RE-
SPECT TO THE SOUTHERN BOR-
DER OF THE UNITED STATES— 
PM 46 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days before the anniversary date of its 
declaration, the President publishes in 
the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
southern border of the United States 
declared in Proclamation 9844 of Feb-
ruary 15, 2019, is to continue in effect 
beyond February 15, 2020. 
The ongoing border security and hu-
manitarian crisis at the southern bor-
der of the United States continues to 
threaten our national security, includ-
ing the security of the American peo-
ple. The executive branch has taken 
steps to address the crisis, but further 
action is needed to address the humani-
tarian crisis and to control unlawful 
migration and the flow of narcotics and 
criminals across the southern border. 
For these reasons, I have determined 
that it is necessary to continue the na-
tional emergency declared in Procla-
mation 9844 concerning the southern 
border of the United States.

THAT STEPHEN MILLER SHOULD 
IMMEDIATELY RESIGN FROM OF-
FICE 
Ms. HARRIS (for herself, Mr. MAR-
KEY, Mr. WYDEN, Mr. BOOKER, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, and Ms. KLOBUCHAR) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on 
Homeland Security and Governmental 
Affairs: 
S. RES. 498 
Whereas Public Law 115–58, a joint resolu-
tion signed into law on September 14, 2017— 
(1) rejects white nationalists, white su-
premacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis, and 
other hate groups; and 
(2) states that in August 2017, white na-
tionalists, white supremacists, Klansmen, 
and neo-Nazis gathered and demonstrated in 
Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting racist, 
anti-Semitic, and anti-immigrant slogans 
and causing violence, from which the Char-
lottesville community is still healing; 
Whereas Stephen Miller is a Senior Advisor 
to President Trump and has long cultivated 
relationships and correspondence with indi-
viduals who adhere to white nationalist ide-
ology; 
Whereas recently published emails of Ste-
phen Miller primarily address the subjects of 
race and immigration, exclusively focus on 
offenses committed by nonwhite individuals, 
and promote policies to severely limit or end 
immigration 
to 
the 
United 
States 
by 
nonwhite individuals; 
Whereas, in such emails, Stephen Miller— 
(1) directly and repeatedly suggests story 
ideas for the website Breitbart, encouraging 
Breitbart to incorporate white supremacist, 
racist, and eugenics ideologies in its news 
coverage; 
(2) adheres to white supremacist ideologies 
in his opposition to Deferred Action for 
Childhood Arrivals (commonly known as 
‘‘DACA’’), a policy that protects from depor-
tation young people, many of whom know no 
other home than the United States, and per-
mits such individuals to make valuable con-
tributions to their communities and the 
Unites States; and 
(3) repeatedly recommends that Breitbart 
publish favorable articles relating to Presi-
dent Calvin Coolidge and the Immigration 
Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 153, chapter 190), a law 
based on eugenics ideology that established a 
national origin quota system to restrict im-
migration from areas other than Northern 
and Western Europe; 
Whereas a former Breitbart editor has ac-
knowledged that Stephen Miller’s sugges-
tions have been used by Breitbart to ‘‘spin a 
narrative where immigrants of color were 
not only dangerous, violent individuals but 
also posed an existential threat to America’’; 
Whereas eugenics encompasses the racist 
belief that the human population can be im-
proved by promoting groups considered ge-
netically superior and eliminating or exclud-
ing groups considered genetically inferior, a 
belief that was strongly embraced by Adolf 
Hitler; 
Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 (43 
Stat. 153, chapter 190) prohibited all immi-
gration from Asia, severely restricted immi-
gration from Africa, and used outdated cen-
sus data to exclude many other individuals 
whom the proponents of the law considered 
inferior or undesirable, including Southern 
and Eastern Europeans; 
Whereas the Immigration Act of 1924 (43 
Stat. 153, chapter 190) was strongly supported 
by eugenicists and reflected the pervasive-
ness of anti-immigrant and nativist senti-
ment in the early twentieth century; 
Whereas President Coolidge wrote, ‘‘Our 
country must cease to be regarded as a 
dumping ground [for new immigrants] . . . . 
Biological laws tell us that certain divergent 
people will not mix or blend’’; 
Whereas, in his manifesto entitled ‘‘Mein 
Kampf’’, Adolf Hitler described the Immigra-
tion Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 153, chapter 190) as 
a model for Nazi Germany to make his eu-
genics ideology a reality; 
Whereas the national origin quotas and the 
eugenics ideology embodied in the Immigra-
tion Act of 1924 (43 Stat. 153, chapter 190) 
governed United States immigration policy 
until the passage of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act 
to amend the Immigration and Nationality 
Act, and for other purposes’’, approved Octo-
ber 3, 1965 (commonly known as the ‘‘Immi-
gration Act of 1965’’) (79 Stat. 911), which re-
placed the national origin quota system with 
a preference system based on family ties and 
professional and skilled employment oppor-
tunities; 
Whereas Stephen Miller is widely under-
stood to direct immigration policy for the 
Trump Administration, including by sup-
porting legislative and administrative pro-
posals that would severely reduce immigra-
tion to the United States and disproportion-
ately reduce immigration from Africa, Asia, 
and Latin America; and 
Whereas Stephen Miller’s leadership posi-
tion brings discredit upon the White House: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Senate condemns Stephen Miller 
for— 
(A) trafficking in bigotry, hatred, and divi-
sive political rhetoric; and 
(B) promoting policies that are incon-
sistent with the trust and confidence placed 
in him as a Senior Advisor to the President; 
and 
(2) it is the sense of the Senate that Ste-
phen Miller, Senior Advisor to the President,

TRAIL OF DEATH’’ 
Mr. YOUNG (for himself, Ms. STABE-
NOW, and Mr. PETERS) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Indian Af-
fairs: 
S. RES. 499 
Whereas the Potawatomi people, collec-
tively known as the ‘‘Potawatomi Nation’’, 
are comprised of members of the many vil-
lages, communities, and bands that resided 
for millennia in their homeland in the south-
ern Great Lakes region of the present day 
States of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, 
and Wisconsin; 
Whereas the advanced farming techniques, 
extensive trade and commerce networks, and 
well-established transportation routes of the 
Potawatomi Nation had a significant influ-
ence on the early history of North America; 
Whereas Potawatomi leaders entered into 
44 treaties with the United States, including 
a series of treaties the Potawatomi people 
were pressured to sign between 1818 and 1828, 
under which the Potawatomi people ceded 
vast areas of the homeland of the Pota-
watomi people in exchange for annuities, 
small reservations in the States of Indiana 
and Illinois, and scattered individual allot-
ments; 
Whereas, in 1830, President Andrew Jack-
son signed the Act of May 28, 1830 (4 Stat. 
411, chapter 148) (commonly known as the 
‘‘Indian Removal Act’’), into law, which au-
thorized the President to provide land in the 
so-called Indian territory in the western 
United States ‘‘for the reception of such 
tribes or nations of Indians as may choose to 
exchange the lands where they now reside, 
and remove there. . .’’; 
Whereas 3 treaties signed by Potawatomi 
leaders in October 1832 further reduced the 
remaining homeland of the Potawatomi peo-
ple in the States of Indiana and Illinois to 
several small reservations and individual al-
lotments, including a reservation at a vil-
lage on the Yellow River in Twin Lakes, In-
diana (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Twin Lakes Reservation’’), under a Pota-
watomi leader named Menominee; 
Whereas pressure from United States nego-
tiators resulted in Potawatomi leaders sign-
ing a number of treaties between 1834 and 
1837, known as the ‘‘Whiskey Treaties’’, 
which ceded the remaining Potawatomi land 
in the State of Indiana and included a com-
mitment to move to reservations in the West 
within 2 years; 
Whereas Menominee and a number of other 
Potawatomi leaders— 
(1) refused to participate in the negotia-
tions that produced the Treaty of August 5, 
1836 (7 Stat. 505) (commonly known as the 
‘‘Yellow River Treaty’’), which purported to 
relinquish the rights of the Yellow River 
Band of the Potawatomi people (referred to 
in this preamble as the ‘‘Yellow River 
Band’’) to the Twin Lakes Reservation; and 
(2) later submitted a petition to United 
States General John Tipton that challenged 
the validity of the Yellow River Treaty; 
Whereas, after the 2-year period for the 
Yellow River Band to move west expired, 
White settlers who wanted to occupy the 
lands of the Twin Lakes Reservation peti-
tioned Indiana Governor David Wallace for 
protection, and, in response, Governor Wal-
lace authorized General Tipton to mobilize a 
militia of 100 volunteers to forcibly remove 
the Yellow River Band from the reservation; 
Whereas, on August 30, 1838, General Tip-
ton and a volunteer militia surprised the 
Yellow River Band at the Twin Lakes Res-
ervation, and, over the next several days, the 
soldiers burned the crops and destroyed the 
village of the Yellow River Band to discour-
age anyone from trying to return; 
Whereas on September 4, 1838, the forced 
relocation of 859 members of the Yellow 
River Band proceeded from Twin Lakes, In-
diana, under the armed escort of the militia, 
including the Potawatomi leaders Menom-
inee, Makkatahmoway, and Pepinawa, who 
were treated as prisoners of war and rode 
along in a wagon under armed guard; 
Whereas, over the course of 61 days, 
through deprivation and often brutal heat 
along the march west, known as the ‘‘Trail 
of Death’’, that extended from Twin Lakes, 
Indiana, through the States of Illinois and 
Missouri to the eventual destination of the 
Yellow River Band some 660 miles away in 
Osawatomie, Kansas, some 42 Potawatomi 
individuals died, including 28 children; and 
Whereas some of the Potawatomi Nation, 
including 
the 
Pokagon 
Band, 
the 
Nottawaseppi Huron Band, the Gun Lake 
Band, and the Hannahville Indian Commu-
nity, evaded forced relocation and the dev-
astating consequences of the Trail of Death 
by fleeing to other locations in the Great 
Lakes region, including to Canada, and else-
where in the United States: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, 
SECTION 1. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. 
The Senate— 
(1) recognizes— 
(A) the special legal and political relation-
ship Indian Tribes have with the United 
States; and 
(B) the solemn covenant that the Pota-
watomi people of the United States share 
with the land; and 
(2) acknowledges the extreme hardship, vi-
olence, and maltreatment inflicted on the 
Potawatomi people by the United States 
through the cruel and ill-conceived policy of 
forcible removal of the Potawatomi people 
from their homeland east of the Mississippi 
River. 
SEC. 2. DISCLAIMER.

Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Mr. 
WICKER, Mr. JONES, and Mr. WYDEN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions: 
S. RES. 500 
Whereas the World Health Organization 
has designated 2020 as the ‘‘International 
Year of the Nurse and the Midwife’’; 
Whereas 2020— 
(1) marks the 200th birthday of Florence 
Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing; 
and 
(2) is an appropriate time to reflect on the 
high-quality health care that nurses and 
midwives provide in all settings across the 
United States; 
Whereas, with approximately 4,000,000 reg-
istered nurses in the United States and 
20,700,000 registered nurses worldwide, nurses 
and midwives— 
(1) represent nearly 50 percent of the global 
health workforce; and 
(2) comprise the largest component of the 
health care workforce in many countries; 
Whereas investing in nurses and midwives 
provides great value to communities; 
Whereas a report of the High-Level Com-
mission on Health Employment and Eco-
nomic Growth of the United Nations con-
cluded that ‘‘investments in education and 
job creation in the health and social sectors 
result in a triple return of improved health 
outcomes, global health security, and inclu-
sive economic growth’’; 
Whereas nurses and midwives have contrib-
uted to major achievements in global health, 
including— 
(1) the eradication of smallpox; and 
(2) reductions in maternal and child mor-
tality; 
Whereas nurses and midwives are known to 
be patient advocates, acting to protect the 
lives of the individuals under their care; 
Whereas nurses and midwives, in caring for 
patients and their families in all stages of 
life, serve as vital members of the health 
care workforce who improve patient out-
comes and safety; 
Whereas better integration of nurses and 
midwives into health care systems is reduc-
ing primary and maternity care provider 
shortages and improving maternal health 
outcomes; 
Whereas nurses promote healthy lifestyles 
and educate communities on disease preven-
tion and health promotion; 
Whereas nurses and midwives are well-po-
sitioned to address and reduce health care 
disparities that exist in the United States, 
including with respect to maternal health; 
Whereas many nurses are experienced re-
searchers, and the work of nurses encom-
passes a wide scope of scientific inquiry re-
lating to clinical science, health systems and 
outcomes, and nursing education; 
Whereas nurses provide care that is sen-
sitive to the cultures and customs of individ-
uals across the United States; and 
Whereas many nurses can inform and work 
closely with legislators to improve the— 
(1) recruitment, education, practice, and 
retention of nurses; and 
(2) health and safety of the patients for 
whom nurses care in all communities, in-
cluding rural and underserved communities: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of the 
‘‘International Year of the Nurse and the 
Midwife’’, as designated by the World Health 
Organization; 
(2) recognizes the significant contributions 
of nurses and midwives to the health care 
system in the United States; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe the International Year of 
the Nurse and the Midwife with appropriate 
recognition, ceremonies, activities, and pro-
grams to demonstrate the importance of 
nurses and midwives to patients.

JONES, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. VAN HOLLEN, 
Ms. WARREN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. GARDNER, 
Mr. UDALL, and Mr. BARRASSO) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 502 
Whereas, following the surprise attack by 
Japanese forces on December 7, 1941, at Pearl 
Harbor, Hawaii, the United States formally 
declared war on the Imperial Government of 
Japan on December 8, 1941; 
Whereas, during the 4 years that followed 
the attack, the United States and allied 
forces fought a prolonged counterattack 
against Japanese advances across the Pacific 
region; 
Whereas the tactic of attacking, defeating, 
and 
controlling 
Japanese-held 
outposts 
through the use of amphibious assault land-
ings against Japanese-held islands and terri-
tories (referred to in this preamble as ‘‘is-
land hopping’’) became crucial to success-
fully countering Japanese advances through-
out the Pacific region; 
Whereas the goal of island hopping was to 
secure airfields and supply bases— 
(1) in order to launch aerial bombardment 
attacks against the mainland of Japan using 
the new Boeing B–29 Superfortress; and 
(2) in preparation for, and in anticipation 
of, a United States invasion of Japan; 
Whereas, by early 1945, the United States 
and allied forces bravely fought and ad-
vanced to the island of Iwo Jima, an 8- 
square-mile volcanic island with 3 strategic 
airfields, located between the Mariana Is-
lands and Japan; 
Whereas Iwo Jima was— 
(1) a strategic island with airfields to sup-
port bombers of the United States with 
fighter escorts; and 
(2) an essential base for emergency, refuel-
ing, and diversionary landings for B–29 
bombers; 
Whereas, under the command of Japanese 
Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, 
Iwo Jima was a heavily fortified island with 
nearly 
11 
miles 
of 
underground 
and 
networked tunnels, rooms, bunkers, artillery 
emplacements, ammunition dumps, and pill-
boxes supporting more than 21,000 Japanese 
soldiers; 
Whereas, on February 19, 1945, under the 
leadership of United States Navy 5th Fleet 
Admiral 
Raymond 
A. 
Spruance, 
United 
States Marine Corps V Amphibious Corps 
Major General Harry Schmidt, 3rd Division 
Major General Graves B. Erskine, 4th Divi-
sion Major General Clifton Cates, and 5th Di-
vision Major General Keller E. Rockey, the 
United States launched an amphibious land-
ing and assault on Iwo Jima that culminated 
with the engagement of more than 70,000 
members of the United States Marine Corps, 
buttressed by thousands of members of the 
United States Navy and the United States 
Army serving as assault, garrison, and sup-
port forces (referred to in this preamble as 
the ‘‘Battle of Iwo Jima’’); 
Whereas the members of the United States 
Marine Corps who fought in the Battle of Iwo 
Jima overcame numerous disadvantages in 
the 36-day battle that included treacherous 
terrain, unfavorable weather conditions, and 
heavy enemy fire from an embedded, deter-
mined, and fierce Japanese fighting force in 
places immortalized by members of the 
United States Marine Corps, including the 
‘‘Meat Grinder’’ and ‘‘Bloody Gorge’’; 
Whereas, on February 23, 1945, only 5 days 
into the Battle of Iwo Jima, members of the 
United States Marine Corps ascended the 
highest 
point 
on 
the 
island, 
Mount 
Suribachi, and raised the flag of the United 
States 2 times, the second of which resulted 
in the iconic, Pulitzer Prize-winning image 
that— 
(1) was captured on film by photographer 
Joe Rosenthal; 
(2) has become a recognized symbol of de-
termination, perseverance, and struggle; and 
(3) has been memorialized as the United 
States Marine Corps War Memorial in Ar-
lington, Virginia; 
Whereas the Battle of Iwo Jima, one of the 
bloodiest battles in the history of the United 
States Marine Corps, resulted in more than 
26,000 casualties of the United States, more 
than 6,800 of whom were killed; 
Whereas most of the more than 20,000 esti-
mated Japanese soldiers who fought in the 
Battle of Iwo Jima were killed, with only 
1,083 Japanese soldiers surviving at the con-
clusion of the campaign; 
Whereas the Battle of Iwo Jima led to 22 
members of the United States Marine Corps 
and 5 members of the United States Navy re-
ceiving the Medal of Honor, representing— 
(1) the most members of the United States 
Marine Corps ever to receive the highest 
military decoration in the United States for 
a single battle; and 
(2) more than 1⁄4 of all members of the 
United States Marine Corps to receive the 
decoration during World War II; 
Whereas the secured airfields on Iwo Jima 
became emergency landing locations for 2,400 
B–29 Bombers, saving the lives of an esti-
mated 24,000 flight crewmen; 
Whereas, 160 days after the end and victory 
of the pivotal Battle of Iwo Jima, the United 
States received the unconditional surrender 
of Japan on September 2, 1945; 
Whereas the world owes a debt of gratitude 
to the members of the United States Marine 
Corps who selflessly led the fight for the

COMMEMORATING UTAH WOMEN’S 
SUFFRAGE 
Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to mark the 150th anniversary of the 
first ballot cast by a woman in the 
United States under an equal suffrage 
law. I am proud that this remarkable 
milestone occurred in my home State 
of Utah. 
The fight for the right to vote for all 
Americans, regardless of gender, race, 
or class, was achieved through efforts, 
large and small, and through great sac-
rifice. 
Suffrage is the freedom to vote, to re-
affirm the solemn duty of the citizen in 
a representative democracy. When I 
vote, I remember the sacrifice of men 
and women in uniform—of those who 
have won and preserved freedom for us 
in the past and of those who preserve it 
for us today. My vote is a recognition 
of that sacrifice. It is right and fitting 
that every American, male and female, 
has that same privilege. 
Our great State of Utah was settled 
by pioneers like Brigham Young, who 
led his people to a new land in search 
of liberty and freedom from oppression. 
While the pioneers and settlers of Utah 
secured freedom of territory, religion, 
and thought, the voices of women were 
still not heard when it often mattered 
most—during the democratic selection 
of their government leaders. 
Seraph Young, like her granduncle 
Brigham Young before her, endeavored 
to chart a different course. In the early 
morning of February 14, 1870, she be-
came the first woman to vote in the 
United States of America. On that elec-
tion day in Salt Lake City, 24 other 
women joined Seraph Young in casting 
their ballots. Then, in the next elec-
tion, 2,000 more women followed their 
lead and exercised their equal suffrage 
rights. The voices of the few set in mo-
tion a monumental shift in our Na-
tion’s history. 
Twenty-four years before the 19th 
Amendment to grant equal suffrage for 
women was ratified, Utah once again 
made history by electing the Nation’s 
first female State senator, Martha 
Hughes Cannon. Cannon did not hesi-
tate to pursue her own path. After re-
ceiving her undergraduate degree in 
chemistry, she went on to earn degrees 
in oration, medicine, and pharmacy at 
a time when few women pursued ad-
vanced education. As a physician, 
church leader, suffragist, and mother, 
she defeated her own husband at the 
ballot box to become the first female 
State senator in U.S. history. 
Soon, we will honor the tremendous 
contributions Martha Hughes Cannon 
and all women suffragists have made as 
we welcome her as a new addition to 
Statuary Hall in the U.S. Capitol. 
The symbols we choose to represent 
us and our State matter a great deal, 
and the bronze rendering of Cannon 
will serve as an enduring tribute to the 
efforts of all suffragists. 
To all the women who have led and 
who continue to lead by example, we 
thank you.

PROTECTING PAIN-CAPABLE 
UNBORN CHILDREN 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, earlier 
this week the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee held a hearing to discuss the 
level of care babies who are born alive 
should receive. You heard me cor-
rectly. We had a hearing in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee to discuss the 
level of medical care a baby that is 
born alive should receive. 
As heartbreaking as it is to even ask 
that question—as if there were more 
than one option—this is a real debate 
and something that needs to be paid at-
tention to. 
There are actually some folks who 
think it is appropriate for doctors to 
provide something less than the high-
est standard of care to babies who sur-
vive abortions, and there are those who 
believe babies who survive abortions 
should receive the same level of med-
ical assistance as any other baby. That 
is certainly where I stand. I believe 
that all life is precious and that every 
baby deserves a fighting chance. 
I can’t imagine that there is a diver-
gence of view on this topic. Of course, 
public opinion polling, for what that is 
worth, shows that the vast majority of 
Americans agree. Last year, a poll 
found that more than three-quarters of 
Americans support providing medical 
support for babies who survive abor-
tions. It is hard for me to believe that 
there would be 25 percent on the other 
side of that, but, suffice it to say, the 
vast majority of people agree with the 
proposition that the same medical 
standard of care should apply. 
Unfortunately, there are people who 
make up that 25 percent in government 
who are in high-ranking positions and 
who wield a great deal of influence on 
this question. Take, for example, Vir-
ginia’s 
Governor 
Ralph 
Northam. 
About this time last year, he made

February 13, 2020 
comments 
which 
were 
deeply 
dis-
turbing about how to care—or rather, 
not care—for certain newborn babies. 
He was caught during an interview. I 
would like to think he misspoke, but 
he certainly didn’t claim that. This 
was actually his view. He said that 
after the baby was delivered, it would 
be kept comfortable. The baby ‘‘would 
be resuscitated if that’s what the 
mother and the family desired, and 
then a discussion would ensue between 
the physicians and the mother.’’ 
What would be the subject of that 
discussion, whether the baby would 
live or die? Presumably so. Instead of 
providing prompt care to save the 
baby, Governor Northam—who is, by 
the way, a pediatrician, of all things— 
believes that you should sit down and 
decide whether to let the child live or 
die. That is not healthcare. That is in-
fanticide. 
In response to Governor Northam’s 
comments—which, 
apparently, 
he 
spoke not just for himself but for a sig-
nificant segment, maybe the 25 percent 
in that poll I mentioned earlier—our 
colleague 
from 
Nebraska, 
Senator 
SASSE, introduced a bill called the 
Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protec-
tion Act. This legislation is very 
straightforward. It would require doc-
tors who treat babies who survive an 
abortion with the same lifesaving care 
that other infants receive. It sounds 
like common sense, right? Well, com-
mon sense apparently is not all that 
common in some quarters. 
You might think that surely there 
are already protections that exist for 
that newborn baby. That has to be the 
law already, right? Sadly not. There 
are 
no 
Federal 
laws 
requiring 
healthcare providers to care for these 
babies just as they would any other in-
fant in their care. 
Sadly, many of our Democratic col-
leagues in the Senate are just fine with 
that. When the Senate voted on this 
legislation last year, 44 Democrats 
voted against it—against it. But for 
those of us who are aligned more with 
the 75 percent of Americans who be-
lieve all babies deserve that care, we 
are not fine with that. 
This legislation would build on the 
Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 
2002, which actually passed the Senate 
unanimously at the time. That bill 
clarified that any infant born alive at 
any stage of development is a person— 
again, a statement of the obvious—re-
gardless of the manner in which they 
were born. 
Now it is time to clarify that each 
person will receive appropriate medical 
care, 
no 
matter 
what 
their 
cir-
cumstances and how they happened to 
be delivered and born. 
One of our witnesses in today’s and 
Tuesday’s hearings was Dr. Robin 
Pierucci, a neonatologist at Bronson 
Methodist Hospital. Dr. Pierucci dis-
cussed the medical standard of care for 
babies born alive and concluded that 
‘‘we are always obligated to care, 
whether or not we have the ability to 
heal.’’ 
I agree with her. There should only 
be one side to this question—the side 
that advocates for equal medical care 
for newborns, the side that believes 
that all infants deserve a fighting 
chance, the side that believes that life 
is precious and must be protected. 
When I attended this hearing, it re-
minded me of an article that was writ-
ten back in 2004 by one of my favorite 
writers, Peggy Noonan. She was talk-
ing about a Presidential candidate, 
General Wesley Clark, running that 
year for the Democratic nomination 
for President. She quotes an interview 
that General Clark had with the pub-
lisher of the Manchester Union-Leader, 
Joseph McQuaid. Here is how the con-
versation went. 
General Clark says: I don’t think you 
should get the law involved in abor-
tion. 
McQuaid said: At all? 
Clark said: Nope. 
McQuaid said: Late-term abortion? 
No limits? 
Clark said: Nope. 
McQuaid said: Anything up to deliv-
ery? 
Clark said: Nope, nope. 
McQuaid: Anything up to the head 
coming out of the womb? 
Clark said: I say it is up to the 
woman and her doctor, her conscience. 
You don’t put the law in there. 
Back when the Supreme Court de-
cided Roe v. Wade, it made clear that 
at some point, once the fetus is viable, 
you are dealing with more than just 
the interest of the mother. I know the 
whole debate over abortion is divisive 
in this country, but at some point you 
have to realize you are not just talking 
about one person but two people, and 
each of those individuals has rights, 
and the State certainly has an interest 
in protecting a vulnerable child. 
In my State of Texas—and I dare say 
in Florida and in every other State in 
the country—we have child protection 
laws in place which say if you witness 
child abuse or neglect, you have a legal 
duty to report it. Again, the law says, 
if you see a child that is being abused 
or neglected, you have a duty to report 
it, and if you don’t do it, you are guilty 
of a crime. 
How in the world we could reconcile 
these ideas that it is somehow OK to 
deliver a child, even though it is a 
botched abortion, and not have a legal, 
much less a moral, duty to care for 
that child is irreconcilable. 
I think it is really important for the 
Senate to stand on the side of life. This 
is not an abortion issue. This is a mat-
ter of equal protection under the law 
and whether we are going to fulfill our 
duty to protect the most vulnerable 
among us—the children, who might 
otherwise be abused or, certainly, ne-
glected. 
I am proud to cosponsor this legisla-
tion and to stand up firmly on the side 
of our most vulnerable citizens. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.

ner in which programs of the agency are

had been reported from the Committee 
on Foreign Relations, with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following:

SERGEANT MICHAEL DELVISCIO 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend the valiant serv-
ice of Magnolia, New Jersey resident Sergeant 
Michael DelViscio, Camden County Town Hall 
Honoree. 
Sergeant Michael DelViscio was born in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1949 and two 
years later he and his family relocated to Bar-
rington, New Jersey. In 1964 the DelViscios 
moved to Stratford, New Jersey and in 1967 
Sergeant DelViscio graduated from Sterling 
High School. Following his graduation at the 
age of 19, Mr. DelViscio enlisted in the United 
States Army. 
As a third-generation member of the United 
States Army, Sergeant DelViscio proudly fol-
lowed in the footsteps of his grandfather and 
namesake Mike DelViscio who served in 
World War I, and his father Frank DelViscio 
who served in World War II. Sergeant Michael 
DelViscio honorably enlisted in the United 
States Army and was deployed during the 
height of the Vietnam War to South Vietnam 
on September 1, 1969. He served with the 
361st Signal Battalion located in Phu Bai. 
Upon returning from his one-year tour of 
duty, in 1970 Mr. DelViscio married his wife 
Fran and was reassigned to Fort Huachuca, 
Arizona. There he served out the remainder of 
his three-year enlistment in Arizona and was 
discharged on November 3, 1971 with the 
rank of Sergeant E–5. He received the Army 
Commendation Medal for his consistent acts 
of meritorious service during his time in the 
United States Army. 
Thereafter, Michael began his Police career 
with the Borough of Magnolia in March 1973 
and was promoted to Sergeant in 1976. In 
1991 Michael and two other officers were 
awarded the Departmental Gallantry Star rib-
bon and a citation for apprehending an armed 
suspect that committed a robbery at a local 
service station. After more than two decades 
of service to his community on July 1, 2001 
Michael retired from his distinguished career 
with the Magnolia Police Department. 
On September 19, 2020 Michael and Fran 
will be celebrating their 50th wedding anniver-
sary. They are proud parents of three daugh-
ters: Andrea, Karen, and Chrisy, who have all 
graduated from Sterling High School. He and 
his wife are the proud grandparents of Mandy, 
Johnny, Danny, Joey, Jacob, Ryan, Conner, 
Tyler, Katie, Michael, Ethan, and Sarah. John-
ny is currently serving in the United States 
Marine Corps and has just completed his first 
year of active duty. Katie, Jacob, and Danny 
are volunteers at the Magnolia Fire Depart-
ment. 
Madam Speaker, Sergeant DelViscio is a 
great American who exemplifies the true 
meaning of a patriot. I ask you to join me in 
honoring the truly exceptional service of Mr. 
Michael DelViscio, of Magnolia, New Jersey. 
TRIBUTE TO THE RIGHT HONOR-
ABLE MICHAEL ‘‘MIKE’’ MOORE 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to a great friend of Amer-
ica and a great leader of New Zealand. 
Former Prime Minister Michael ‘‘Mike’’ Moore 
has been called ‘‘a force of nature’’ and was 
a dedicated defender of working people. The 
Right Honorable Moore transitioned on Feb-
ruary 2, 2020, but his legacy will live on. 
Prime 
Minister 
Moore 
was 
born 
in 
Whakatane, New Zealand. He was educated 
at Bay of Islands College and Dilworth School, 
but left school at the age of 14. While working 
as a laborer and a printer, he became very ac-
tive in the trade union movement and was 
elected to the Auckland Trades Council at the 
age of 17. Through his union work, he be-
came active in politics and became the first 
youth representative on the Labour Party ex-
ecutive. He also served as vice president of 
the International Union of Socialist Youth for 
two terms. 
In 1972, at the age of 23, he became the 
youngest person elected to the New Zealand 
Parliament. During his years of public service, 
he held various ministries in the Labour gov-
ernment, including Overseas Trade Minister, 
Minister of External Relations, and Deputy 
Minister of Finance. He served as Minister of 
Foreign Affairs from 1984 to 1990, when he 
won the post of Prime Minister after the res-
ignation of Geoffrey Palmer. Yet his service as 
New Zealand’s political leader lasted only 
eight weeks, ending when the Labour Party 
lost control of Parliament in the general elec-
tion of 1990. He was defeated as the Labour 
Party leader three years later. 
From 1999 to 2002, Moore served as direc-
tor-general of the World Trade Organization, 
where his service was marked by his efforts to 
help poor countries effectively participate in 
multilateral trade. He then served as New 
Zealand’s Ambassador to the United States 
from 2010 to 2015, where I was fortunate to 
get to know him. He was an avid supporter of 
my annual golf tournament and Scholarship 
Banquet in Santee, South Carolina, always 
sending a New Zealand team to participate. 
Although he didn’t have much formal edu-
cation, Moore claimed, ‘‘the Labour Party has 
been my training college, Parliament my uni-
versity.’’ His keen intellect was well known and 
he was awarded honorary doctorates from Lin-
coln University, the Auckland University of 
Technology and the University of Canterbury, 
the People’s University of China, and La 
Trobe University in Australia. He was also a 
prolific reader and wrote books on economics, 
politics and New Zealand history. 
Moore was married to Yvonne Dereany, a 
teacher and host of the children’s television 
program Romper Room, for 45 years. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and our col-
leagues to join me in celebrating the life of 
New Zealand’s Prime Minister Mike Moore. He 
was a distinguished public servant, who had a 
heart for the people and a love of history. He 
said in his final speech as a Member of Par-
liament that ‘‘a nation is the sum total of its 
history, its memories, and experiences. A na-
tion without history is like a man without a 
memory.’’ May we all remember this sentiment 
and honor his legacy.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 150TH AN-
NIVERSARY OF STEVENS INSTI-
TUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 
HON. ALBIO SIRES 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, today, I recog-
nize and congratulate Stevens Institute of 
Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey on its 
150th anniversary. 
Stevens Institute of Technology was found-
ed as the United States’ first college of me-
chanical engineering on February 15, 1870 
with a bequest from Edwin A. Stevens, a 
member of one of America’s great families of 
inventors. Over the past 150 years, the univer-
sity has expanded to include all engineering 
and science disciplines, an accredited School 
of Business, and a College of Arts and Let-
ters. 
From its earliest days, Stevens has honored 
its mission to inspire, nurture, and educate 
leaders in tomorrow’s technology driven envi-
ronment while contributing to the solutions for 
the most challenging problems of our time. 
Today, Stevens is among the fastest-growing 
universities in the nation, attracting top stu-
dents and faculty from New Jersey, the nation, 
and across the world. 
Stevens is one of the largest producers of 
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathe-
matics (STEM) degree recipients in New Jer-
sey and ranks first in New Jersey and fifteenth 
in the nation in the production of engineering 
graduate degrees. Students at Stevens’ ben-
efit from the university’s technology-centric 
education, which provides a unique, problem- 
solving, and entrepreneurial approach to learn-
ing and is a passport to success. Stevens has 
an outstanding 96 percent placement rate for 
its graduates and its alumni have launched

and led numerous companies and organiza-
tions. 
Stevens faculty, students, and alumni have 
pioneered research and innovations in many 
diverse fields, including transportation, tele-
communications, resiliency, sustainability, arti-
ficial intelligence, machine learning, health 
care, biomedicine, cybersecurity, maritime se-
curity, and systems engineering. It is not an 
exaggeration to say that Stevens has changed 
and improved the way we live, work, and com-
municate. Stevens has also contributed signifi-
cantly to the community as well as the local, 
state, and national economy. 
It is my great honor to recognize Stevens 
for this significant milestone in the history of 
the university and to thank its leadership, fac-
ulty, students, and alumni for their contribu-
tions to Hoboken, Hudson County, the State of 
New Jersey, and the United States.

GLOUCESTER TOWNSHIP, NEW 
JERSEY 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend Gloucester 
Township, New Jersey, First Place in the Na-
tion—2019 National Night Out. 
Gloucester Township is a community in the 
heart of Camden County, home to nearly 
70,000 residents. In 2016, Gloucester Town-
ship won eighth nationally for National Night 
Out and in 2018 the town won seventh place 
in the nation. Each year the town’s National 
Night Out event continues to grow more pop-
ular. This year, for the thirty seventh annual 
National Night Out, Gloucester Township won 
first place in the nation for their community 
event for a town with 50,000 to 100,000 resi-
dents. 
National Night Out is an event focused on 
crime and drug prevention in coordination with 
building stronger police-community relations. 
Through strengthening community spirit and 
developing 
stronger 
programs 
like 
crime 
watch, Gloucester Township is being recog-
nized on both a state and national scale for 
their safe and caring environment. 
Gloucester Township is protected by the 
dedicated Gloucester Township Police Depart-
ment which responds to nearly 60,000 calls for 
service each year, with an average of 5,000 
calls per month. The department consists of 
over 133 full-time sworn law enforcement offi-
cers, 35 special law enforcement officers, 17 
telecommunicators, and 16 civilian employees 
and we extend the sincerest appreciation for 
Gloucester Township Police Department and 
all law enforcement. 
In rediscovering our own communities, it is 
no surprise that we see more people moving 
to Gloucester Township and ‘‘joining the ex-
citement.’’ During Mayor David Mayer’s admin-
istration, the township has substantially ex-
panded economically and grown as a commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring and congratulating Gloucester Town-
ship, as well as the Gloucester Township Po-
lice Department, on their achievement of earn-
ing first place in the United States of America 
for their 2019 National Night Out community 
celebration. 
HONORING BONNIE LOWENTHAL’S 
CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bonnie Lowenthal and her ca-
reer of public service. 
Ms. Lowenthal began her public service to 
the Long Beach, California community nearly 
five decades ago, serving as a licensed family 
counselor, mental health consultant, and as an 
educator. 
Her work in the Long Beach community 
began a life-long focus on affordable housing 
and the problem of homelessness. She was 
appointed as Vice Chair of the Mayor’s Task 
Force on Homelessness in 1987 and worked 
to find mechanisms to house people and pre-
vent homelessness. 
Her community work also led Ms. Lowenthal 
to a deep involvement with the Long Beach 
Cambodian community and in 1989 she was 
named Director of Planning for the United 
Cambodian Community organization while 
also serving as the Arts Manager representing 
a group of Cambodian musicians and founding 
the Cambodian Children’s Orchestra. In 1991, 
Ms. Lowenthal traveled to Cambodia with a 
national Red Cross group to investigate the 
proliferation of landmines left behind during 
the decades of war that had engulfed the 
country. She also helped initiate a sister-city 
relationship between Long Beach and Phnom 
Penh and would go on to be an official ob-
server during Cambodia’s first municipal elec-
tions in more than 40 years. Ms. Lowenthal 
has also served as Clinical Director for the 
Cambodian Association of America and as a 
participant on the Cambodiatown Advisory 
Board. 
In 1994, Ms. Lowenthal was elected to the 
first of two terms on the Long Beach Unified 
School District Board. Her dedication and 
commitment to students helped Long Beach 
earn a national reputation as one of the coun-
try’s best urban school districts. 
After winning a 2001 special election for the 
1st District of the Long Beach City Council, 
Ms. Lowenthal would go on to win two full 
terms for the seat in 2002 and 2006. Selected 
by her colleagues as Vice Mayor in 2006, she 
was also elected by 27 regional cities to the 
Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transpor-
tation Authority Board. She has stated that her 
mission on the Long Beach City Council was 
to make sure that the residents of her work-
ing-class district were as well represented at 
City Hall as residents of the city’s wealthiest 
neighborhoods. 
In 2008, Ms. Lowenthal was elected to her 
first of three terms in the California State As-
sembly. Her district, encompassing what is 
now the 70th Assembly District, remains one 
of the most ethnically diverse populations in 
the state. 
During her three terms in the State Assem-
bly, Ms. Lowenthal’s district included the Long 
Beach/Los Angeles port complex—the busiest 
container complex in the Western Hemi-
sphere. As an Assemblymember, she was in-
strumental in helping create more than 18,000 
transportation-related jobs, while also pro-
tecting the employment rights of thousands of 
other port workers. 
In addition to transportation issues, during 
her tenure in the State Assembly she focused 
on standing up for children, seniors, and the 
environment. She authored laws that protected 
coastal waters from invasive species; made it 
easier for older adults to stay in their homes; 
encouraged state workers to blow the whistle 
on wrongdoing; and made it easier for school 
districts to provide children with a safe ride to 
school. She also authored important legislation 
that brought additional federal funds to foster 
youth, protected injured workers from unjust 
medical bills, and reduced the cost of prison 
healthcare by millions of dollars a year. 
Her leadership positions in the State As-
sembly included chairing the Legislative Wom-
en’s Caucus, the Assembly Committee on 
Transportation, the Joint Committee on Emer-
gency Management, and the Select Com-
mittee on Ports. She served as a member of 
the committees on Accountability and Adminis-
trative Review, Environmental Safety & Toxic 
Materials, Health, and other select commit-
tees. 
For her service in the State Legislature, Ms. 
Lowenthal was named Legislator of the Year 
by the California Assisted Living Association, 
the California Association of Marriage and 
Family Therapists, and the California Chiro-
practic Association, among many others. 
In 2017, Ms. Lowenthal was named to the 
Long Beach Board of Harbor Commissioners 
by Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia, and 
elected President of the Board in July 2019, 
following a year of service as Vice President 
of the board. 
As a member of the five-member board, Ms. 
Lowenthal is responsible for the management 
and oversight of City’s Harbor Department 
which operates the Port of Long Beach, the 
nation’s second-busiest port. She was unani-
mously confirmed by the City Council as the 
68th appointee to the Board since the current 
Commission was established in 1925. Her ap-
pointment made her the seventh woman to 
serve on the Commission and marked the first 
time in the port’s history that the five-member 
Board had four female members at the same 
time. 
Besides serving on various Commission 
sub-committees, Ms. Lowenthal also rep-
resents the port on national and international 
trade missions and serves as the board rep-
resentative or alternate to a variety of port-re-
lated leadership organizations. 
In addition to her work on the Board of Har-
bor Commissioners, Ms. Lowenthal serves her 
community on the St. Mary’s Medical Center 
Governing Board, the U.S. Vets Advisory 
Board, the Children Today Board of Directors, 
the LINC Housing Board of Directors, and the 
Jewish Family and Children’s Service Board of 
Directors. 
I want to thank Ms. Lowenthal for her nearly 
five decades of commitment to her community 
and for the dedication to public service that 
has allowed her to give so much to that com-
munity.

February 13, 2020 
William Caton, who passed away on February 
6, 2020 at the age of 74. Dr. Caton was a life-
long leader in the field of neurosurgery and 
led a distinguished career that had lasting im-
pacts on my district in the San Gabriel Valley 
and throughout California. 
Dr. Caton was born in Harrisburg, Pennsyl-
vania on July 7, 1945 and spent his childhood 
in Georgia and Massachusetts. He received 
his bachelor’s degree from Massachusetts In-
stitute of Technology (MIT) and then moved to 
California to attend medical school at the Uni-
versity of Southern California (USC) School of 
Medicine. He received his M.D. in 1971 and 
completed his residency in Neurosurgery at 
the Los Angeles County—USC Medical Center 
in 1977. After completing his residency, Dr. 
Caton began his practice in Pasadena, a com-
munity he would serve for the next forty years. 
Dr. Caton’s dedication to his patients earned 
him the reputation as one of the top neuro-
surgeons in California. He was a representa-
tive for the California Association of Neuro-
logical Surgery (CANS) at National State 
Council meetings for twenty-five years and 
served as President from 2009 to 2010. He 
also represented CANS in meetings with LA 
County that resulted in developing a county- 
wide system of trauma care centers in 1983. 
He was appointed to serve as Chairman of 
Neurosurgery at Huntington Memorial Hos-
pital, the leading trauma center within the San 
Gabriel Valley, a position he would hold for 
over twenty years. His work was also well 
known around the globe. He collaborated on a 
project in Bangalore, India, where he advised 
the development of a brain cancer treatment 
center, and he created an international sympo-
sium on healthcare, also located in India. 
He was a strong advocate for higher edu-
cation and passed his knowledge on to mul-
tiple generations of students. For almost forty 
years, he was a Clinical Assistant Professor in 
the Neurological Surgery Department at USC. 
He was also a long-time faculty member at 
California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 
the Department of Biology and Bioengineering. 
While there, he founded the Caltech Students 
Medical Mentor Program, served as director of 
the Caltech M.D.-Ph.D. Clinical Outreach Pro-
gram, and became director of the Pasadena 
Neuroscience Fellowship. Because of his dis-
tinguished service and contributions to higher 
education, Dr. Caton received an honorary 
graduate degree from the Caltech Alumni As-
sociation in 2008. Additionally, he was a 
strong advocate for the education of women 
and served on the Board of Trustees for 
Mayfield Senior High School, an all-girls col-
lege preparatory high school, from 1986 to 
1997. 
Dr. Caton leaves behind an enduring legacy 
of service, patient advocacy, and leadership to 
the San Gabriel Valley, Los Angeles County, 
and California. He is an inspiration to all who 
knew him, and it is my distinct honor to com-
memorate his life.

HOMELAND SECURITY FOR 
CHILDREN ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior Member of Congress, I rise in support of 
H.R. 2932, the ‘‘Homeland Security for Chil-
dren Act,’’ which would direct the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to 
identify and integrate the needs of children 
into activities to prepare for, protect against, 
respond to, recover from, and mitigate against 
the risk of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, 
and other man-made disasters. 
The ‘‘Homeland Security for Children Act’’ 
would 
make 
children’s 
needs 
a 
priority 
throughout the Department of Homeland Se-
curity (DHS), by directing the DHS Undersec-
retary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to incor-
porate feedback from children’s organizations 
into Department-wide activities. 
This legislation would require DHS to submit 
a report to Congress on the Department’s ef-
forts to integrate the needs of children into the 
policies, programs, and activities at DHS. 
DHS will authorize a Children’s Technical 
Expert position, ensuring that the Agency will 
adequately incorporate the needs of children 
into its emergency preparedness, response, 
recovery, and mitigation activities. 
Due to their general incapacity to protect 
and advocate for themselves, children are 
more likely to succumb to the negative out-
comes associated with disasters and acts of 
terrorism. 
FEMA has consistently missed the mark 
when 
it 
comes 
to 
acknowledging 
and 
prioritizing the unique needs of children in its 
disaster-related activities. 
When disaster strikes, whether natural or 
manmade, the country has historically strug-
gled to adequately prepare for children’s 
unique needs. 
For example, in Houston Hurricane Harvey 
made land fall in 2017 and proceeded to affect 
13 million people, cause $125 billion dollars in 
damages, and take the lives of 94 individuals. 
Nearly 3 million children in Harris County 
alone were impacted by Hurricane Harvey. 
Six months after the storm approximately 
4,000 childcare programs, afterschool pro-
grams, and schools closed for weeks in the 
Greater Houston area. 
Hurricane Harvey resulted in an increase to 
the number of economically disadvantaged 
children, cases of mental health issues and 
student homelessness. 
The shortage of childcare throughout the im-
pacted regions prevented many families from 
returning to their ‘normal’ lives. 
Traumatic experiences, such as a natural 
disaster, can negatively impact a child’s men-
tal health, cause an increase in irritability, ag-
gression, anger, and physical ailments, such 
as headaches and stomach aches. 
It is vital that FEMA makes it a priority to in-
tegrate the needs of children into their activi-
ties to prepare for, protect against and miti-
gate against the risk of natural disasters, acts 
of terrorism, and other man-made disasters. 
I ask all Members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 2932, the ‘‘Homeland Security for 
Children Act.’’

CELEBRATING 
THE 
175TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF MONITEAU COUN-
TY, MISSOURI 
HON. VICKY HARTZLER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to congratulate Moniteau County, in 
Missouri’s Fourth Congressional District, on 
the 175th anniversary of its founding. 
The territory that now makes up Moniteau 
County was originally part of the 1803 Lou-
isiana Purchase. It was organized on February 
14, 1845, carved out of territory from Cole and 
Morgan counties. The name of this county, 
taken from Moniteau Creek, is the French 
spelling of an Indian word meaning ‘‘spirit of 
God’’ or ‘‘Country of the Great Spirit.’’ The 
county epitomizes its name as evidenced by 
the many vibrant churches today in the com-
munity. 
Agriculture is our state’s leading industry, 
and Moniteau County is one of our state’s 
leading producers of agricultural goods, known 
particularly for its beef, ham, and turkey prod-
ucts. 
Moniteau County is a wonderful place in 
which to live, work, and raise a family. As this 
historic anniversary is celebrated, I wish the 
county and its citizens well and many more 
years of peace and prosperity.

cated service members treasured in our hearts 
and constantly in our prayers for their service 
to God and country.

MS. JEAN WILEY, CIVIL RIGHTS 
LEADER AND ACTIVIST 
HON. JOHN LEWIS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Ms. Jean Wiley, who transitioned 
from the world that she tirelessly fought to im-
prove, on December 9, 2019. 
Born on June 11, 1942 to Elizabeth Thelma 
Holland Boyer Wiley and Joseph Alphonsus 
Wiley, Jean Wiley was a proud daughter of 
Baltimore, Maryland, where she completed her 
undergraduate degree at Morgan State Uni-
versity. As a testament to her work and leg-
acy, many parts of our country—Michigan, 
Alabama, California, Washington, D.C., and 
Georgia to name a few—claim this amazing 
woman. 
In 1953, the Supreme Court integrated 
Washington, D.C., but a few miles up the 
road, Ms. Wiley grew up surrounded by the 
oppressive stench of segregation in Baltimore. 
In 1963, she and other students took matters 
into their own hands; police arrested Jean and 
her friends as they conducted a sit-in to de-
segregate Baltimore’s theaters. Upon hearing 
that Howard University students were heading 
up the highway to reinforce their protest, Balti-
more’s Mayor released these brave young ac-
tivists and integrated the facilities. 
Madam Speaker, I believe that taste of suc-
cess fueled Ms. Wiley’s life-long passion for 
civil and human rights. A few years later, Jean 
completed graduate studies at Michigan State 
University and began to teach at Alabama’s 
Tuskegee Institute (now University). Professor 
Wiley challenged her students to expand their 
minds and inspired many to join the national 
movement for civil rights. 
I will forever cherish my memories from this 
period of our lives, when young people from 
all different walks of life became nonviolent 
foot soldiers in the fight for our freedom. After 
Hosea Williams and I attempted to lead a 
march from Selma to Montgomery on a day 
that became know as Bloody Sunday, Ms. 
Wiley and more than 500 Tuskegee students 
caravanned from Macon County to Mont-
gomery, Alabama to protest in solidality for our 
right to vote. At the end of the summer, Con-
gress passed, and President Lyndon B. John-
son signed the Voting Rights Act into law on 
August 6, 1965. 
Madam Speaker, for many of us in the Stu-
dent 
Non-Violent 
Coordinating 
Committee 
(SNCC), Jean was and will always remain a 
sister. Time and time again, she put her life 
and livelihood on the line in her pursuit of truth 
and justice. Jean taught volunteers to can-
vass, offered her home as a refuge, and even 
became the voice and face of SNCC during 
the summer of 1965, when she served as our 
national media relations coordinator. In this 
role, Ms. Wiley played the integral, critical role 
of sharing our work in the Deep South with the 
nation and the world. Whether we were boy-
cotting, protesting, or testing voter registration 
procedures, Jean made sure that our work 
was not ignored. 
After serving on the front lines of the Civil 
Rights Movement, Ms. Wiley made her way to 
Washington, D.C. where she helped create 
the Center for Black Education. Throughout 
her life, Jean was committed to the betterment 
of the African Diaspora and refused to wait for 
oppressive forces to see the light on their 
own. Over the years, she shared her expertise 
with Howard University’s WHUR radio station, 
Essence Magazine, and the Institute for the 
Black World, an Atlanta-based think-tank. 
As a devoted educator, Jean also continued 
to teach at the University of the District of Co-
lumbia and the University of California at 
Berkeley. Whether in the classroom or in her 
home, Professor Wiley shared the lessons and 
tactics of the Civil Rights Movement with new 
generations—including her cousin, Ms. Kim-
berly W. Ross, who works closely with me and 
my office on Capitol Hill. 
As loved ones gather to reflect upon Ms. 
Jean Wiley’s good and great work, I would like 
to pay tribute to the unbreakable bond of her 
adoring family—son, Cabral Stuckey Wiley; 
granddaughter, Breijanee Wiley; great-grand-
daughters, Shariyah Harris and Narii Parker; 
sisters, Joyce Dyson and Lois Wiley Benjamin; 
nieces, Shiree Dyson and Ayisha Dyson; and 
nephews, Keith Dyson, Toure´ Dyson, and Mal-
colm Wiley. 
Madam Speaker, the record should be 
clear: Ms. Wiley dedicated every ounce of her 
energy to the fight for justice. For these rea-
sons, I proudly join all who knew, loved, 
learned from, and cared for this great leader 
in celebrating her life’s work to transform the 
face and soul of our nation.

DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SE-
CURITY CLIMATE CHANGE RE-
SEARCH ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, February 10, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of Congress, I rise in support of 
H.R. 4737, the ‘‘Department of Homeland Se-
curity Climate Change Research Act,’’ which 
requires the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) to evaluate existing federal research re-
garding approaches to mitigate climate change 
on homeland security, to identify areas for fur-
ther research within the Department, and to 
research and develop approaches to mitigate 
the consequences of climate change on 
homeland security. 
This legislation directs DHS to assess and 
potentially expand existing federal research 
projects that examine ways to mitigate the ef-
fects of climate change on homeland security 
programs. 
The development in research from DHS will 
explore the connection, if any, between cli-
mate change and homeland security, including 
how the resulting competition for resources, 
economic distress, and social discontent can 
contribute to acts of terrorism. 
Climate change poses a direct threat to U.S. 
national security through its effects on critical 
infrastructure, the lives of citizens, the econ-
omy, and energy security. 
The scarcer resources become, the more 
power is given to those who control them, es-
pecially in regions where people are particu-
larly reliant on natural resources for their liveli-
hoods. 
Terrorist groups will exploit the natural dis-
asters and water and food shortages expected 
to result from climate change and allow them 
to recruit more easily, operate more freely and 
control civilian populations. 
H.R. 4737 will ensure that DHS is ade-
quately structured to meet the demands of re-
sponding to and recovering from acts of ter-
rorism and natural disasters that are aggra-
vated by climate change. 
Climate change is not just a global problem, 
but also a threat to domestic security. 
More than 60 percent of the country has 
faced moderate to extreme drought conditions 
and massive heat waves which devastated 
corn crops, put pressure on food prices, and 
caused deaths around the country. 
Climate change poses costly threats to our 
domestic installations and potentially desta-
bilizing threats to our international installations 
that hold strategic importance to the United 
States. 
The extreme weather events that we have 
witnessed in the past 5 years illustrate the im-
pact of climate change in the U.S. is much 
more complicated than a simple rise in tem-
peratures. 
Each region of this country will be impacted 
differently; understanding these regional con-
sequences is important to policymakers be-
cause it will allow planning for response and 
adaptation. 
Studies show that Texas is among a string 
of ‘‘Deep South’’ states that will experience 
the worst effects of climate change. 
For example, Hurricane Harvey was a 1,000 
year storm that has to date claimed the lives 
of at least 30 persons. 
Before it was finished, Hurricane Harvey 
dropped 21 trillion gallons of rainfall on Texas 
and Louisiana, most of it on the Houston 
Metroplex. 
A record 4,323 days, which is nearly 12 
years, elapsed since a major hurricane (Cat-
egory 3 or above) made landfall in the United 
States prior to Hurricane Harvey; the last Cat-
egory 3 hurricane to hit the United States was 
Hurricane Wilma in 2005, the same year Hurri-
cane Katrina destroyed much of New Orleans. 
To put in perspective the devastation 
wrought by Hurricane Harvey, the volume of 
water that fell on Houston and other affected 
areas of Texas and Louisiana could fill more 
than 24,000 Astrodomes or supply the water 
for the raging Niagara Falls for 15 days. 
In the first three days of the storm, more 
than 49,000 homes that had suffered flood

damage and more than 1,000 homes were 
completely destroyed in the storm. 
Local authorities closed major freeways, air-
ports, and schools. 
In the first three days of the storm, more 
than 49,000 homes that had suffered flood 
damage and more than 1,000 homes were 
completely destroyed in the storm. 
More than 30,000 persons were forced out 
of their homes due to the storm. 
Presently, Houston experiences about five 
days each year over 100° Fahrenheit and by 
2100, the city could expect some 70 days over 
100° Fahrenheit. 
The major weather and climate disasters 
that Texas experienced each produced at 
least a billion dollars in losses. 
As the climate continues to warm, more 
multi-year droughts are expected with dev-
astating impacts to the state’s agriculture sec-
tor and drinking water. 
As climate change affects food security and 
the availability of water and land, affected peo-
ple will become more vulnerable not only to 
negative climate impacts but also to recruit-
ment by terrorist groups offering alternative 
livelihoods and economic incentives. 
Climate change will directly affect America’s 
homeland and the security of its citizens. 
I ask all Members to join me in voting to 
pass H.R. 4737, the ‘‘Department of Home-
land Security Climate Change Research Act.’’

STANDING IN SUPPORT OF SOCIAL 
SECURITY & MEDICARE 
HON. CHARLIE CRIST 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of Social Security and Medicare, pro-
grams that literally save the lives of millions of 
Americans 
every 
day and serve nearly 
200,000 veterans, children, seniors, and per-
sons with disabilities in my district, and over 
69 million across the country. I was deeply 
disappointed this week to see that the Presi-
dent’s budget included steep cuts to these life- 
sustaining programs. Cutting $35 billion from 
Social Security and $500 billion from Medi-
care, not only puts Pinellas families and their 
loved ones at risk of losing their healthcare 
and benefits but also places a huge undue 
burden on some of the most vulnerable in our 
communities. We should be lending a helping 
hand to those in need, not turning them away. 
These cuts and broken promises will hurt peo-
ple. And we cannot stand idly by. Let’s protect 
Social Security and Medicare, now and al-
ways.

HONORING JUDGE ROMONDA D. 
BELCHER AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Judge Romonda D. Belcher, a 
District Associate Judge at the Polk County 
Justice Center in Des Moines, Iowa as the 
Iowan of the Week. Judge Belcher is the first 
African American female judge to serve in the 
state of Iowa. She was appointed to the bench 
on August 20, 2010 and serves our commu-
nity with distinction. 
Like many young girls across this country, 
she set her goals high at a young age. She 
grew up in North Carolina and moved to Iowa 
to attempted Drake Law School. Before she 
was selected to be a judge, she worked in the 
Polk County Attorney’s Office for 15 years, 
serving in multiple different capacities includ-
ing important work in juvenile justice. She’s 
been a mentor to women and attorneys across 
Iowa—including mentoring those who move 
here from out of state about how to handle our 
winter. 
As District Associate Judge, she continues 
to exemplify justice and equality by treating 
those who come before her fairly, with com-
passion and respect. The late Iowa Supreme 
Court Justice Mark Cady believed it was these 
qualities in Judge Belcher that makes her so 
valuable to our community. He said that Judge 
Belcher’s ‘‘presence and her approach and the 
kindness she displays is very needed’’ by the 
those who come before her courtroom. 
I have great respect and admiration for folks 
who stand up for people who can’t always 
stand up for themselves. Judge Belcher has 
made it her mission to help and had a dedi-
cated life of public service, and Iowans are 
better because of it. It is an honor to com-
memorate the outstanding achievements of 
Judge Belcher and celebrate her as our Iowan 
of the Week.

DORTCH 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE COM-

HON. JOE CUNNINGHAM 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a man who has held many ti-
tles throughout his life; scholar athlete, How-
ard University graduate, U.S. Army officer, 
decorated Vietnam veteran, professor, attor-
ney, pastor, and—for fifteen years—inmate. 
John C. Dortch was born in Beaufort, South 
Carolina, the son of a Baptist minister. He was 
a gifted musician at a young age, an impres-
sive student athlete, and a distinguished Mili-
tary Graduate from Howard University who 
volunteered to serve in Vietnam at the age of 
22. 
After returning home from war, a series of 
bad decisions led John to participate in a bank 
robbery where a police officer was killed. John 
took full responsibility of his past, enrolling in 
law school after he was released from prison 
and leading programs for first-time juvenile of-
fenders and anti-violence initiatives. 
John turned his biggest regret into a mission 
of servitude, founding the Circle of Hope Min-
istries for the homeless in the Lowcountry. 
Every day he asks himself, ‘‘Did I help some-
one today?’’ John’s life of service is a testa-
ment to the truth that every person is more 
than the worst thing they have done. It is an 
honor to know him. 
IN RECOGNITION OF MOLLY DOB-
SON AS SHE IS NAMED WOMAN 
OF THE YEAR 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Molly Dobson as she is named 
Woman of the Year by the United Way of 
Washtenaw County’s Women United group. 
Dobson’s lifetime of community service and 
philanthropy is worthy of commendation, and 
we are proud to recognize her achievements 
today. 
Molly Dobson is a pillar of Washtenaw 
County. After graduating from the University of 
Michigan in 1944, Dobson enlisted in the U.S. 
Navy where she worked in communications 
throughout World War II. After returning home 
to Ann Arbor, Michigan, Dobson embarked on 
a new era defined by giving, philanthropy, and 
community service. In the 1960s, Dobson 
began working with United Way and has been 
completely dedicated to furthering its commu-
nity-building mission ever since. Throughout 
the years, Dobson has assisted the organiza-
tion in several capacities, serving as a fund-
raiser, a member of the Budget Priorities 
Committee, and later sitting on the Board. 
Alongside 
numerous 
other 
achievements, 
Dobson will particularly be remembered for 
her efforts to develop the D-SIP internship 
program with the University of Michigan. 
Thanks to her work and generosity, 313 un-
dergraduate students have completed the pro-
gram since its inception. 
Today, we celebrate Molly Dobson for her 
lifetime of service to her community, her state, 
and her country. Her years of philanthropy 
have impacted the lives of many, and her con-
tinued dedication provides a lasting example 
for what we should all endeavor to accom-
plish—to effect change, be compassionate 
community members, and do all we can to 
make a difference in the world. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Molly Dobson. Her decades of 
selfless service make her a deserving recipi-
ent of the Woman of the Year award. I am 
grateful for her lasting impact and wish her 
continued success in the years ahead.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN 
VOTERS 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, February 13, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and celebrate the 100th 
birthday of the League of Women Voters. For 
the past century, this non-partisan, women-led 
civic organization has worked diligently to pro-
mote citizens’ active participation in our de-
mocracy by educating and informing the public 
about their government. 
I am proud to recount that on February 14, 
1920, shortly before the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment granted women their long sought- 
after right to vote, the National League of 
Women Voters was organized at the national 
convention held in Chicago, Illinois. The 
League merged the National Council of 
Women Voters and the National American 
Woman Suffrage Association, establishing one 
umbrella organization to encourage and assist 
women to exercise their newly-established 
right to vote. The organization considers 
Carrie Chapman Catt its founder, and Maud 
Wood Park served as the League’s first Presi-
dent. 
While the League’s mission was initially fo-
cused upon engaging with and promoting the 
participation of women in our republic, the or-
ganization’s scope has dramatically expanded 
over the years. Today, the League is hard at 
work expanding civic participation and pro-
moting good government. The organization is 
heavily involved in voter registration efforts 
and sponsors candidate debates and forums 
across the country each election cycle, pro-
viding communities the opportunity to hear 
from candidates before they head to the ballot 
box. 
While the League is non-partisan, the orga-
nization is not apolitical. The League of 
Women Voters has a long history of taking a 
stand on important issues. The League sup-
ported the creation of the United Nations, the 
passage of the National Voter Registration 
Act, and regularly stands up for what is fair 
and just. The organization supports efforts ad-
dressing climate change, counteracting gun vi-
olence in our communities, establishing hu-
mane immigration policies, and ensuring that 
all Americans have access to affordable health 
care, among other important issues. 
In 1973 the League modified its charter and 
allowed men into its ranks. Today, men and 
women alike make up its over 500,000 mem-
bers and supporters at over 700 state and 
local leagues. The organization is represented 
in all 50 states as well as Washington, DC, 
the Virgin Islands, and Hong Kong. 
On behalf of the residents of the 9th Con-
gressional District of Illinois, I wish a happy 
100th birthday to the League of Women Vot-
ers. We are grateful for their service to the na-
tion, and I hope the League will continue its 
efforts for the next century and beyond as 
they work to educate and promote civic partici-
pation.
