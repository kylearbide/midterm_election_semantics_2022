Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 2021 
No. 87 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair wishes to 
remind all Members about certain 
standards of decorum in the Hall of the 
House. Members are reminded that the 
announced policies of January 4, 2021, 
as updated on May 11, remain in effect 
with respect to the wearing of masks. 
The Chair will reiterate that Mem-
bers and staff are currently required to 
wear masks at all times in the Hall of 
the House except when a Member has 
been recognized by the Chair or when a 
Member acting as Chair is speaking. 
The Chair reminds Members that the 
House is following the guidance of the 
Attending Physician, who has stated 
that the present mask requirement and 
other guidelines remain unchanged in 
the Hall of the House until all Members 
and floor staff are fully vaccinated. 
The Chair also informs Members that 
the Attending Physician’s guidance is 
consistent with the Centers for Disease 
Control guidelines. 
Members are further reminded that 
under House Resolution 38 the Ser-
geant at Arms is authorized and di-
rected to impose a fine against any 
Member acting in violation of these 
policies. 
The Chair expects Members to con-
duct themselves with appropriate deco-
rum in the House Chamber at all times. 
That includes proper attire, behavior 
that is respectful of other Members and 
of staff, and adherence to mask re-
quirements and other safety protocols 
intended to protect all of those present 
in the Hall of the House. To follow 
these basic standards of practice is to 
facilitate an atmosphere of respect for 
each other and for this institution. 
The Chair appreciates the attention 
of the Members to these matters. 
MORNING-HOUR DEBATE 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to the 
order of the House of January 4, 2021, 
the Chair will now recognize Members 
from lists submitted by the majority 
and minority leaders for morning-hour 
debate. 
The Chair will alternate recognition 
between the parties, with time equally 
allocated between the parties and each 
Member other than the majority and 
minority leaders and the minority 
whip limited to 5 minutes, but in no 
event shall debate continue beyond 
11:50 a.m. 
f 
INFLATION TAX 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
when the Democrats passed Mr. Biden’s 
$1.9 trillion spending spree in March, a 
lot of people got a lot of free money, 
thousands of dollars in many cases. 
But the bill is already coming due for 
that free money, and as many of us 
warned, it turns out that free money is 
very expensive. 
Indeed, it turns out that the very 
same families most harmed by the 
lockdowns will be the most harmed by 
paying the bill for the lockdown relief. 
It comes to about $15,000 for an average 
family, and the first installment is re-
flected in the rising inflation sapping 
the purchasing power of working fami-
lies. 
Government cannot put a single dol-
lar into the economy that is not first 
taken out of the same economy. When 
government spends a dollar for you, it 
has already decided to take a dollar 
from you. And it can only be taken 
back in three ways: from your current 
earnings through higher taxes, from 
your future earnings through bor-
rowing, and from your savings and pur-
chasing power through inflation. There 
is no other way to pay for every dollar 
that government spends. Inflation is 
the most insidious of these taxes be-
cause it silently hollows out every-
thing that a family labors to achieve. 
Anyone who has gone near a gas sta-
tion or a grocery store in the last few 
months can now see where their relief 
checks came from and how they are 
going to be paid back. The Democrats 
shut down productivity with their 
lockdowns, and then they flooded the 
economy with dollars. More dollars 
chasing fewer goods is the classic rec-
ipe for inflation. And this is just the 
first installment of the bill already 
coming due for the left’s reckless 
spending. 
The Consumer Price Index increased 
4.2 percent in April. It was 2.6 percent 
in March, and it is 4.2 percent now. 
Core inflation is already growing faster 
than at any time since the end of the 
Carter administration. 
Now, what does that mean, exactly? 
Well, it means that if you have man-
aged to save $100,000 for your retire-
ment, the government has just taken 
out $4,200 of it because your savings are 
now worth that much less. Your bal-
ance hasn’t declined, but its pur-
chasing power has lost $4,200. 
Check your grocery bill or your util-
ity bill. How much more are you spend-
ing to put food on the table or heat 
your home? There are other bad poli-
cies at work as well—green energy, for 
example—but a big part of that dif-
ference is your inflation tax, paid di-
rectly from the reduced purchasing 
power of your money. And that is true 
of everything you buy. 
It doesn’t stop there. The Democrats 
are promising a massive increase in 
corporate taxes while assuring the gul-
lible not to worry, that only the cor-
porations will pay it. But corporations 
don’t pay corporate taxes; you do. You 
pay them as a consumer through high-
er prices. You pay them as an employee 
through lower wages. And you pay 
them as an investor through lower

earnings—your 
401(k), 
for 
example. 
There is no other way that a corporate 
tax can be paid. And the resulting re-
duction in productivity will further 
feed their inflation tax. 
The Democrats’ sick joke is this: Ev-
erything that the government has 
handed out to your family is already 
being taken back from your family 
through higher prices, and that pain is 
only beginning. 
What makes the Democrats think 
that socialism will work any better 
here than every other country that has 
tried it? It consistently produces short-
ages, unemployment, inflation, pov-
erty, and malaise wherever it is im-
posed. And I am afraid we will continue 
down this dismal path until Americans 
awaken to the simple economic reali-
ties that the Democratic socialists 
have now unleashed upon our country. 
In his inaugural address, Thomas Jef-
ferson surveyed the boundless bounties 
of our Nation and asked: ‘‘With all 
these blessings, what more is necessary 
to make us a happy and a prosperous 
people? Still one thing more, fellow 
citizens: a wise and frugal government, 
which shall restrain men from injuring 
one another, shall leave them other-
wise free to regulate their own pursuits 
of industry and improvement, and shall 
not take from the mouth of labor the 
bread it has earned. This is the sum of 
good government.’’ 
Madam Speaker, Americans deserve 
a wise and frugal government. But it is 
not enough to deserve it. We have to 
demand it at the ballot box. 
f 
SUPPORT THE PRESIDENT’S TAX 
PLAN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DEMINGS). The Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
KHANNA) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to talk about President Biden’s 
tax plan with some basic facts. 
President Biden proposes no tax in-
creases on 99 percent of Americans. 
This chart illustrates that, with 154 
million Americans, not a single Amer-
ican in the 99 percent is going to pay a 
dime more. 
In fact, they are getting a tax cut. 
We are giving them a tax cut with the 
child tax credit. We are giving them a 
tax cut with the earned income tax 
credit. 
So the obfuscation on the other side 
to convince 99 percent of Americans 
that somehow their taxes are going to 
go up when President Biden is deliv-
ering a tax cut for them is just factu-
ally false. 
What does this mean? If you work in 
manufacturing, if you are a nurse, if 
you are a teacher, if you are a doctor, 
if you are a lawyer, most likely, your 
taxes aren’t going up. For the 99 per-
cent—not just in the working class, but 
in the middle class, in the upper middle 
class—your taxes are not going up. 
They are going down. 
In fact, the President has extended 
Trump’s tax cut for those who are 
making under $75,000. 
It is important we get those facts, 
and I want the American people to look 
at this chart. If you really fall in that 
sliver of the top 1 percent, your taxes 
are going up. If you are everyone else 
in the 99 percent, your taxes aren’t 
going up. They are going down, in most 
cases. 
So, people wonder how, in a democ-
racy, we wouldn’t want this. How 
wouldn’t we want those who are going 
to make the most in the tiny 1 percent, 
why wouldn’t the 99 percent want them 
to pay a little bit more? It turns out 
that the top 1 percent—and let’s just be 
clear, if you make over $538,000, you 
are in that top 1 percent. I personally 
don’t know a lot of doctors or lawyers 
or others who are making more than 
$538,000 a year. 
But if you are in that 1 percent, you 
have made $4.8 trillion over this pan-
demic—$4.8 trillion. And the over 600 
billionaires, they have made $1.6 tril-
lion over the pandemic. 
I know that because a lot of them are 
in my district. We have had the 
digitization of the economy. They are 
making a lot of money. Some of them 
are brilliant. Guess what they told me? 
They can afford to pay a little more. 
Do you know what the market cap of 
companies in my district is? It is $10 
trillion in Silicon Valley. That is more 
than the GDP of Russia. It is more 
than the GDP of most countries. 
I laugh when people say this tag of 
socialism. My district is producing the 
most wealth in the world. The people 
there who say we want to pay a little 
bit more aren’t socialists. They are 
wealth generators. 
But here is what they know: They 
fall into this 1 percent, and they are 
saying we have made trillions of dol-
lars. We have made billions of dollars. 
We would like to pay a little bit more 
so everyone can have healthcare, edu-
cation, and nutrition in this country, 
and we are fine with other people in 
the working and middle class getting a 
tax cut. 
That is the President’s policy. It is a 
policy of helping working-class Ameri-
cans, middle-class Americans, upper- 
middle-class Americans, and asking 
those who have done well to do a little 
bit more for our country. 
It is a policy against inherited 
wealth because we are Americans. We 
don’t believe in feudal estates. We 
don’t believe what the law is right now, 
that if you buy $1 million of Facebook 
stock and that becomes $10 million and 
if you want to give it to your kids, that 
your kids don’t have to pay tax on the 
appreciation of $9 million. We don’t 
think that is right. We don’t think you 
should be able to transfer wealth with-
out paying any tax. 
That is not the American way. That 
is what they used to do in old Europe’s 
feudal estates, passing wealth genera-
tion to generation. That is the party of 
aristocracy, and that is what the Re-
publicans would have you believe. 
We are the party of free markets, free 
enterprise, and new entrepreneurs. We 
are the party of economic growth for 
everyone. We are not the party of dy-
nastic wealth. 
If you believe that everyone should 
have a shot in the free market econ-
omy, that you should have economic 
growth for everyone and opportunity 
for everyone, if you are against dynas-
tic wealth, if you believe those who 
have made $4.8 trillion can pay a little 
bit more and you can have tax cuts for 
the working class and middle class, you 
should support President Biden’s tax 
plan. 
f 
BORDER CRISIS IS GETTING 
WORSE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. TONY GONZALES) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. TONY GONZALES of Texas. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to high-
light the crisis that is happening on 
our southern border. 
My district, Texas 23, represents 820 
miles of the Texas and Mexico border. 
That is 40 percent of our southern bor-
der. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden border 
crisis is as bad as it has ever been, and 
it is only getting worse. Over 20,000 un-
accompanied children have entered 
into our country, and that number is 
only rising. 
These children don’t have a voice. 
These 
children 
aren’t 
represented. 
These children are nothing more than a 
stat on a paper, and that is wrong. 
On Mother’s Day weekend, of all 
days, these five young girls, babies, es-
sentially, were found abandoned on a 
ranch in Texas. 
b 1015 
Well, today, I am here to talk about 
their story and give them a voice. 
Two of these girls, Ashley, who is 5 
years old, and her sister, Valeria, who 
is 11 months old, are from Guatemala. 
Two of the other girls, Nasley, who is 7, 
and Cristal, who is 4, are from Hon-
duras. They happen to be related. They 
are cousins. 
As they have made this trek to 
America, they were dumped on a farm 
in Texas with no water and no food. 
The oldest of them is 7 years old. Imag-
ine that you are 7 years old, and your 
responsibility is to take care of your 
younger sister that is 4 and take care 
and ensure that your cousins, who are 
5 and 11 months, not only are okay, but 
survive the night. That is wrong on all 
accounts. 
I want to tell a little bit more about 
this story. Sandra is the mother of 
Nasley and Cristal. Sandra has at-
tempted to make this trek many times, 
and, unfortunately, she was turned 
around at the border several times. 
So she goes off and she gives her chil-
dren to smugglers. Why? Because she is 
desperate. The situation at our south-
ern border is desperate, and we need to 
act now. We need to reform immigra-
tion, and we need to secure our south-
ern border; not only for these young la-
dies here, but for all children who are

making that dangerous trek, and for 
all people who live along the border 
and see this every single day. 
What is happening with these girls? 
They get put in HHS and then get re-
leased. Guess where they are going. 
They are going to Houston, Texas, to 
try to be reunited with a family mem-
ber. 
All cities of the United States are 
border cities. All States of the United 
States are border States. This crisis 
has continued to spiral out of control, 
and we, here in Congress, as well as the 
administration, must come together 
and reform immigration and secure our 
southern border. 
f 
RESPONDING TO CYBERATTACKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. HIMES) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, as I 
rise, gasoline is once again flowing 
through the Colonial Pipeline, and we 
are getting ready to undertake our rou-
tine briefs—those of us who sit on the 
Intelligence Committee and the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security—of this 
week’s cyberattacks. Many of them 
will have come from Russia, from 
China, from North Korea, from Iran, or 
from some shadowy criminal group, 
which is often sheltered or at least tol-
erated by one of these countries. Many 
will have succeeded in stealing critical 
data or penetrating essential networks. 
Only a few, like the recent attacks on 
the Colonial Pipeline, will ever become 
publicly known. 
There is a long list of things that we 
must do to stop these attacks. We 
should require private companies to 
tell the public, or at least the govern-
ment, when these attacks occur. We 
should make sure that experts in 
places like the NSA and the FBI are 
working side-by-side with network op-
erators to address these attacks, and 
we should have a clear policy on the 
payment of ransom to ransomware at-
tacks. 
But at the very top of the list is the 
need to fundamentally change the 
game by establishing a sure and swift 
deterrence. 
Time and again, we do too little, too 
late. 
Five years ago, President Obama re-
sponded to the Russian attack on our 
2016 election, the very essence of our 
democracy, with the expulsion of 35 so- 
called Russian diplomats and the clos-
ing of a few secondary Russian facili-
ties, and he told Putin to ‘‘cut it out.’’ 
Putin barely felt the slap on the wrist. 
We know that, because fewer than 4 
years later, a Russian intelligence 
agency used a supply chain attack on 
Microsoft and SolarWinds to penetrate 
thousands of networks, including those 
of the Federal Government. In re-
sponse, the United States—you guessed 
it—expelled some Russian diplomats. 
For the bad guys, the cost of doing 
business is very low indeed. 
It is time to strike back using our 
unparalleled offensive cyber capabili-
ties with the ferocity and precision 
and, yes, the proportionality that these 
and many other cyberattacks would 
have provoked had they been under-
taken kinetically. 
Let’s hurl the full weight of the 
American legal, diplomatic, and cyber 
capabilities against DarkSide and the 
organizations or countries that as-
sisted it. There is no reason why our 
immense power, if applied, can’t result 
in jailed hackers, businesses sanc-
tioned into bankruptcy, emptied bank 
accounts, and melted computers. 
The same goes for Putin, who draws 
no formal distinction between the 
Kremlin and the private groups who 
supply it with propaganda, merce-
naries, and hacking services. Putin re-
spects only the Machiavellian language 
of force and retribution. For him, all 
else is tactical. So let’s demonstrate 
the cyber capabilities we have spent 
billions of dollars developing. Let’s 
make sure that he and the oligarchs 
who support him feel the fear and anx-
iety felt by millions of Americans con-
templating crashed email systems and 
gasoline lines down the street. 
The objection to my arguments has 
always been consistent: that as a high-
ly networked nation, we are particu-
larly vulnerable to a cyber tit-for-tat. 
In a cyber exchange, the Russians, the 
Chinese, or the Iranians might choose 
to attack our critical infrastructure, 
like, say, a gasoline pipeline. Yes, 
there is risk, but that risk must be 
weighed against the fully unacceptable 
status quo. 
Hitting back isn’t the only answer. It 
is part of the answer. In this new 
world, a credible deterrent must be 
combined 
with 
clearly 
articulated 
international rules, norms, and an un-
derstanding of our national doctrines: 
all the things that helped keep the 
Cold War with the Soviets from becom-
ing hot. 
Above all else, however, it is time to 
change the game and impose the mean-
ingful costs that will finally deter our 
adversaries. Until we do, we are all just 
waiting for the next Colonial Pipeline 
attack. 
f 
GETTING AMERICANS BACK TO 
WORK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEHLS. Madam Speaker, I stand 
here today after speaking with busi-
ness owners across my district and the 
country. I have heard story after story 
of businesses struggling to get entry- 
level, minimum-wage workers back to 
work. Why is that? Because they are 
actually 
having 
to 
compete, 
not 
against 
COVID 
or 
lockdowns, 
but 
against the Federal Government to get 
employees back to work. 
In my home State of Texas, you can 
make up to $535 in unemployment in-
surance, but add in the additional $300 
per week payments that came from 
Federal COVID relief, and that is $835 
per week not to work. That equates to 
nearly $21 an hour. That is exactly why 
Texas and 20 other States have opted 
out of Federal COVID unemployment 
insurance benefits. But there are still 
States where business owners are being 
forced to compete against the Federal 
Government for employees. 
My own brother, Tyler, who owns a 
construction company in Wisconsin, 
told me business has picked up for him. 
What a blessing. Now, he is trying to 
hire additional employees to grow his 
business. He has just got one problem: 
Folks are telling him they are making 
more sitting at home at $17.50 an hour. 
They tell him if he wants them to 
work, he is going to have to pay them 
$25 an hour. 
Situations like my brother Tyler’s 
were hardly an unexpected consequence 
of paying workers more not to work. 
So expected, it seems as though when 
Democrats failed to get their minimum 
wage hikes through the Senate in Feb-
ruary, they used the Federal unem-
ployment insurance program to accom-
plish the same result, albeit tempo-
rarily. 
While there are many who are still 
struggling from the effects of COVID, 
whether it be from health effects or the 
effects of lockdowns on their business, 
millions more are taking advantage of 
the unemployment insurance system 
and sitting at home playing Xbox in-
stead of working and being productive 
members of society. 
On top of a labor shortage driven by 
the Federal Government paying people 
not to work, President Biden is pro-
posing historic levels of spending and 
raising taxes on our job creators. His 
multi-trillion-dollar proposals, like his 
$2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan and 
$1.8 trillion American Families Plan, 
will cost thousands of jobs through tax 
hikes amid an already struggling mar-
ket. 
What message does raising the cor-
porate tax rate send to job creators 
when they are trying to rebuild in the 
aftermath of the pandemic? It sure 
sounds like we are telling them to take 
their business overseas or hire less. 
To bounce back from the Biden ad-
ministration’s dismal job reports in 
April, which showed just 266,000 new 
jobs added, certainly underperforming 
the Dow Jones estimate of 1 million 
new jobs, we need to be stimulating 
economic opportunity and growth with 
less taxes and less regulation, which 
will create good-paying jobs that en-
courage people to get back in the work-
force. 
What won’t fix our struggling econ-
omy is throwing money at the problem, 
which seems to be all the Washington 
swamp knows how to do. The liberal 
tax-and-spend model is failing our 
economy and failing the American peo-
ple. Gas prices are up, homes are more 
expensive, and the per pound cost of 
copper is more than double what it was 
just 12 months ago. 
We are not going to spend our way 
out of this mess with $1-trillion pro-
grams that do nothing but serve liberal

special interests. We do it by letting 
the free market flourish through lower 
taxes, lower regulation, and more eco-
nomic freedom. 
This model worked under President 
Trump, who delivered record lows in 
unemployment for Blacks, Hispanics, 
Asians, and women, and it will work 
again, if only the Biden administration 
will put the American people first and 
not special interests. 
f 
ELECTION CONTEST DISMISSED 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. UNDERWOOD. Madam Speaker, 
last week, we passed a resolution dis-
missing the last House election contest 
of the 2020 cycle, in the 14th District of 
Illinois. 
Before this resolution came to the 
floor, the Committee on House Admin-
istration approved it with unanimous 
bipartisan support. 
I am incredibly honored that my 
community chose me to represent 
them in Congress again, and I look for-
ward to a productive term. 
But I am not here to take a victory 
lap. This is an important moment, not 
because of which candidate won, but 
because the constitutional rights of my 
constituents were upheld, despite my 
opponent’s efforts to disenfranchise the 
very people he sought to represent. 
Much like the previous President, my 
opponent ignored voters’ voices by de-
claring himself the winner days before 
the results were in. Once the votes had 
been tallied, he again joined the former 
President in making baseless allega-
tions of fraud and conspiracy. 
After a careful consideration of the 
merits of his case, the committee 
found that my opponent’s many argu-
ments about supposed irregularities 
failed to add up to a credible claim to 
the result he wanted. 
Exhibiting the utmost disrespect for 
his own would-be constituents, he even 
went so far as to attempt to invalidate 
thousands of ballots, under a techni-
cality that the Illinois Supreme Court 
had already deemed invalid under both 
the State and Federal Constitutions. 
Specifically, the court warned that 
the standard my opponent sought to 
apply in this case would allow corrupt 
officials to deliberately toss out ballots 
of voters whom they had reason to be-
lieve voted otherwise than they de-
sired, which is exactly what he at-
tempted to do. 
By passing the resolution dismissing 
this baseless contest, the House upheld 
the results that were verified by seven 
county clerks, including four Repub-
licans, and certified by the State of Il-
linois. 
On behalf of my constituents whose 
voices were heard despite these efforts 
to silence them, I want to thank the 
many election officials and volunteers 
who safely and successfully adminis-
tered the highest-turnout election in 
history, during a pandemic. 
I also want to thank the House Ad-
ministration Committee and its hard-
working staff for faithfully carrying 
out the Federal Contested Elections 
Act by rejecting this attempt at dis-
enfranchisement. 
Unfortunately, the contest in my dis-
trict was just one battle in a war that 
is still ongoing, a war on democracy, 
on voting rights, and on truth itself. 
It will take more than a resolution to 
defeat the big lie: a seditious effort to 
delegitimize the 2020 election and every 
future election. 
As the so-called debate about wide-
spread fraud that did not occur raged 
on, I have been shocked and horrified 
by the willingness of so many people to 
tell dangerous, flat-out lies, people who 
should know better, including, terrify-
ingly, elected officials at every level of 
government. 
I desperately hope for a future where 
the fabric of reality itself is no longer 
under attack, because there can be no 
compromise here. There is nothing to 
compromise on. The choice is simple: 
truth or lies. 
In the meantime, Madam Speaker, 
let me tell you about the reality that 
others have left far behind. The reality 
is that the American people chose 
Democrats to lead the House, the Sen-
ate, and the White House. In reality, 
Americans voted for healthcare, for 
childcare, and for a safe climate and 
environment. 
b 1030 
In reality, Americans chose historic 
numbers of women, people of color, and 
LGBTQ people to represent them in 
this Chamber. 
There are people who refuse to face 
this reality, like my erstwhile oppo-
nent, the former President, and far too 
many others in positions of great re-
sponsibility. Their denial of the truth 
is incompatible with the democracy we 
all swore an oath to defend. 
A few months ago, we endured a vio-
lent insurrection here in this building, 
an all-too-real manifestation of this 
widespread assault on reality. We sur-
vived the attack, but we are still in the 
midst of an insidious erosion of norms 
and policies that threatens our democ-
racy, including by sowing distrust of 
our elections and our democratic insti-
tutions. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in rejecting these 
attacks on our democracy by living as 
though the truth were true.

FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT BONUS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. FITZGERALD) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to talk briefly on a topic 
that has come up numerous times al-
ready this morning. I just attended a 
meeting of the Small Business Com-
mittee in which we had an extensive 
discussion as well. 
If you remember back when the 
CARES package was moving through 
Congress, there were a number of legis-
lators who identified that an issue was 
being created that didn’t need to nec-
essarily be created, and that was addi-
tional dollars being set aside for those 
who would find themselves unem-
ployed. 
As a former State legislator in Wis-
consin, I had kind of gone through a 
process back in 2008 and 2009, which ba-
sically was an unemployment insur-
ance fund—and I would underscore the 
idea insurance—that was in the red. It 
was as a result of the number of unem-
ployment claims that were being made 
in my State. 
There was a nonpartisan commission 
that had been created to kind of over-
see this process, without getting too 
far into the details. It had worked, 
where there had been some give and 
take. Employers and those who rep-
resented employers knew that there 
would be X amount of dollars taken 
out of everyone’s payroll that would 
supplement or pay for the premiums 
associated with unemployment, and 
the system worked. But when the up-
tick came as a result of the economy 
sputtering at the time, it went into the 
red. 
It is just a reminder, I think, of what 
we find ourselves kind of in the midst 
of right now. As I said, some earlier 
speakers referenced this. We have this 
$300-a-week bonus that so many people 
are calling it right now. And I get it; I 
am not trying to be too judgmental on 
people who actually find themselves in 
that position. 
But what we are hearing from em-
ployers is that, as a result of the new 
dollars being in that unemployment 
system, it is doing two things. The 
first thing it is doing is obviously put-
ting the regular private-sector market 
that employers are typically used to, 
and it is forcing them to kind of either 
increase wages to the point where it 
doesn’t work for them. It just won’t 
work for their small business model. 
They can’t afford it and still be able to 
put out goods and services. 
The other thing it does, though, is it 
keeps people on unemployment. So 
what 
we 
are 
experiencing 
in 
our 
State—and I think I am hearing that 
other States are experiencing the same 
thing, and I think we are up to 19 dif-
ferent States right now—Governors 
have made a decision to pull back on 
the 
$300 
a 
week. 
It 
is 
certainly 
cratering these unemployment insur-
ance pots again. They can’t keep up 
with it. 
So I am here today to just tell the 
constituents of Wisconsin and, really, 
nationwide, as we see State by State 
and the economy kind of moves in one 
direction, that there has to be a 
change. It is not even a partisan issue. 
Something has to give here in the 
short term, and I would certainly hope 
that President Biden would take a 
deeper look at this. I think the House 
and the Senate should actually move in

a direction where there would be some 
type of reduction in these benefits very 
soon. 
I am very worried about this whole 
idea that there are a number of individ-
uals out there right now who, I think, 
find themselves in a position where, 
you know, they are going to wait. They 
are just going to wait. They are going 
to wait for September to come, they 
are going to wait for October to come 
before they really start to reengage. 
The other thing in Wisconsin and 
other States that exists, when you are 
on unemployment insurance, you had 
to go out and look for a job. You know, 
you had to talk to employers and you 
had to develop your soft skills, which 
means, you know, making sure you are 
ready for work and you get to work on 
time. I am a little concerned that the 
pandemic has had a direct effect on 
that as well. 
Madam Speaker, I just wanted to be 
here this morning to highlight these 
issues again. I would like to work with 
the other side of the aisle and I would 
like to work with the President to 
make sure that we can find a way of re-
versing what I think is a path that is 
really going to jeopardize our entire 
nationwide economy. 
f 
PREVENTING FUTURE PANDEMICS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to discuss what we must do 
to prevent the next pandemic and why 
it is not only a global health issue, but 
also an environmental one. 
The origins of the pandemic we are 
battling now are clear: unsanitary, un-
safe wildlife markets. 
These markets, which are prevalent 
in some areas of Asia and Africa, but 
are present everywhere, including in 
the United States, are fed by trade in 
wildlife; some of it legal; some of it il-
legal; all of it very dangerous. 
They are breeding grounds for a 
strain of viruses known as zoonotics, 
which are diseases born from the un-
natural intermingling of the bodily 
fluids of different species in an unsafe 
and unsanitary market that sold wild-
life, living and dead, for human con-
sumption. 
Other 
zoonotics 
include 
SARS, 
MERS, Zika, Ebola, swine flu, bird flu, 
HIV/AIDS, and now COVID. COVID–19 
has truly opened the world’s eyes to 
the danger of these markets and the 
global impact, and it should open our 
eyes to just how urgent the need for 
legislation around this is in order to 
prevent the loss of millions of lives. 
That is why over the course of the 
last year I wrote the Preventing Fu-
ture Pandemics Act along with my 
friend, Mr. FRED UPTON, and Senators 
CORY BOOKER and JOHN CORNYN in the 
Senate. We may not agree on much, 
but we agree on this: We have the 
power to prevent the next pandemic, 
and to do nothing would be an act of 
negligence. 
A vital lesson that we need to learn 
from COVID is that we must fundamen-
tally change the way that we interact 
with wildlife globally if we want to 
stop this from happening again. This 
means stopping deforestation and other 
habitat destruction, slowing and end-
ing global climate change, and global 
shutdown of live wildlife markets. 
Already we have seen how changes in 
temperature and weather patterns and 
encroaching human development have 
brought people and wildlife into more 
frequent and more intimate contact. 
Human consumption of wildlife is sim-
ply the most dangerous form of that 
contact. 
To get at the root of this problem, 
the Preventing Future Pandemics Act 
would establish the official foreign pol-
icy of the U.S. to be that we would 
work with other countries to shut 
down these markets, end the trade in 
terrestrial wildlife for human con-
sumption, and build international coa-
litions to reduce the demand for wild-
life as food. 
The bill would authorize funding for 
USAID to work on reducing demand for 
consumption of wildlife from wildlife 
markets, and support shifts to alter-
nate sources of food and protein in 
communities that rely upon this con-
sumption for food security. 
Moreover, to truly lead by example, 
this bill would end the import and ex-
port of wildlife for human consumption 
in and out of the United States. 
While wildlife is not a major source 
of protein in our country, these mar-
kets do exist here, and they still pose a 
danger. If we are to establish and main-
tain a position of international leader-
ship on this issue, we must practice 
what we preach. 
This bill will help us take significant 
steps to break down the silos between 
global health and conservation, be-
cause we know unequivocally that if 
we try to treat these as separate prob-
lems, we fail to solve either problem. 
After the economic and social devas-
tation of the past year, and the way 
that COVID–19 has upended all of our 
lives, it is my view that the Preventing 
Future Pandemics Act is a national se-
curity bill, a conservation bill, an ani-
mal wildlife bill, a small business bill, 
a travel industry bill, a manufacturing 
bill, a retail bill, a mental health bill, 
a housing bill, and a public transit bill. 
It is a bill to protect our lives and live-
lihoods from the threat of human con-
sumption of wildlife and the associated 
wildlife trade. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to rally around this in order 
to potentially save the world from suf-
fering the consequences of inaction and 
standing by hopelessly as we watch an-
other pandemic ravage our world. 
The next pandemic can be stopped, 
and the Preventing Future Pandemics 
Act is a vital first step. Let’s do it to-
gether. 
AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I agree 
with the comments of many of my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle ex-
pressing grave concern over the Presi-
dent’s decision to establish a date cer-
tain for the withdrawal of all U.S. mili-
tary forces from Afghanistan. I believe 
this decision is deeply misguided, and 
it is damaging to the long-term na-
tional security interests of the United 
States and our allies. 
The strawman argument of ending 
forever wars might be a convenient 
campaign slogan, but it is strategically 
naive and deeply offensive to those who 
have volunteered to fight to ensure 
that the very organization which at-
tacked us on September 11, 2001, is in-
capable of ever doing it again. 
This is their job. It is a job that I did 
on four deployments. It is our sworn 
duty. It is their sworn duty. They are 
proud to do it, and we honor them for 
it. 
The truth is our force levels in Af-
ghanistan are a fraction of what they 
once were, and have been steadily de-
creasing for years. Maintaining a small 
residual force is not an unaffordable or 
unsustainable burden. More than any 
other deployment in the world, the 
U.S. and NATO presence in Afghani-
stan delivers tangible strategic bene-
fits to the U.S. at a relatively small 
and ever-decreasing cost, not to men-
tion the immense humanitarian benefit 
to the people of Afghanistan itself, es-
pecially the women and the girls. 
The recent violence committed by 
the armed forces in Afghanistan only 
proves that the Taliban, al-Qaida, and 
ISIS-K clearly see this announcement 
as a full-fledged capitulation, and it re-
veals 
their 
true 
nature 
as 
untrustworthy and savage. 
A military withdrawal must always 
be based on conditions, not a calendar. 
By establishing a specific date, we are 
simply surrendering the hard-fought le-
verage we have gained over two dec-
ades, and we are inviting the Taliban 
to embark on a vicious reign of terror 
against the Afghanistan people. 
Furthermore, as a military man, I 
am utterly dismayed that we did not 
take the necessary steps to secure and 
prepare standoff basing in the region to 
project power when needed to conduct 
counterterrorism operations and to 
support the Afghan National Defense 
and Security Forces before announcing 
the withdrawal. 
We put the cart before the horse. We 
now have a moral obligation to ensure 
that the Afghan security forces can 
continue functioning with the proper 
military and financial support to keep 
the Taliban from once again plunging 
Afghanistan into darkness. 
Finally, and most urgently, we must 
honor our promises and keep faith with 
our partners and allies. Our values 
must remain the foundation of our for-
eign policy. If our partners and allies

lose faith in our ability to back them 
up, we willingly cede the field to an 
enemy who seeks our destruction. 
It is now, unfortunately, a moral im-
perative to find a way to expedite the 
safe passage of the very people who 
stood by us for nearly two decades. 
They have been loyal to our shared vi-
sion and have sacrificed so much to the 
pursuit of democracy. Their safety 
must be an absolute priority for this 
administration. 
So far, we have not observed suffi-
cient urgency in developing an inter-
agency plan to do this and in request-
ing the necessary resources and au-
thorities from Congress. If we don’t do 
this, the Afghans who helped our mili-
tary will be hunted down and murdered 
by the Taliban. 
We must ask ourselves: Did we learn 
anything from our clumsy withdrawal 
from Iraq in 2011? 
The only thing more expensive than 
maintaining a moderate level of sta-
bility in a country like Afghanistan is 
the bloodshed and cost we will bear if 
we are forced to return. 
This is not an academic, hypothetical 
consideration, nor is it a partisan 
issue. Like many others on this side of 
the aisle, I repeatedly and publicly ex-
pressed my deep concerns over Presi-
dent Trump’s impulse for a hasty with-
drawal. 
The Taliban is still allied with al- 
Qaida. If the Taliban prevails after our 
withdrawal, it is very likely that al- 
Qaida will once again have a safe haven 
to conduct terrorism, and this is the 
very reason we invaded Afghanistan in 
the first place. 
Fortunately, pushback from Congress 
and the previous administration slowed 
the withdrawal process while retaining 
negotiating leverage and key counter-
terrorism capabilities. Unfortunately, 
from my vantage point, this latest de-
cision has abandoned any semblance of 
strategy. It is a retreat. 
This hasty withdrawal is a tragic 
mistake, and we are going to regret it. 
I urge the President to change course 
before it is too late.

HONORING MICHAEL LECIK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Virginia (Ms. SPANBERGER) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to remember the life of a coura-
geous, kind, and selfless Virginian, 
Mike Lecik. 
Service was an unwavering part of 
who Mike was. Throughout his career, 
Mike served as an Air Force firefighter, 
an assistant fire chief with the U.S. De-
partment of Defense, and the assistant 
chief at the Huguenot Volunteer Fire 
Department in central Virginia. 
As an Air Force firefighter, Mike de-
ployed twice to the Middle East. After 
coming home to Powhatan County, he 
was proud to serve in his local volun-
teer fire department. He cared deeply 
for his community and his country. A 
few years ago, Mike was diagnosed 
with multiple myeloma, a blood cancer 
linked to the dangerous conditions of 
his service as an Air Force firefighter. 
I first got to know Mike because the 
VA did not recognize this connection, 
and he wanted to do something about 
it. He wanted to learn more about how 
the system could be changed for the 
better and for the benefit of his fellow 
servicemen and -women. 
This fight was not just about getting 
the support that he needed; rather, it 
was about the thousands of firefighters 
just like him who faced this challenge. 
Mike truly wanted every veteran fire-
fighter to get the care they deserved. 
Mike passed away earlier this year at 
the age of 41. 
Mike was dedicated to his commu-
nity, the safety of his neighbors, and, 
above all, his family. It was my honor 
to have him as a constituent. 
Mike leaves behind a family and a 
community that deeply cared for him, 
and he leaves behind a cause that is 
worth championing. 
Across the board, firefighters are 
more likely to be exposed to certain 
carcinogens. They are more likely to 
suffer certain diseases and illnesses be-
cause of their career. And they experi-
ence higher rates of cancer than the 
general U.S. population. 
This connection is well-documented 
by scientific research, but it is yet to 
be recognized by the VA, the Federal 
agency entrusted with caring for those 
who have borne the battle. 
Military firefighters put their lives 
on the line each day—not just to de-
fend our country but also to selflessly 
defend their fellow servicemembers. 
But to this day, thousands of veteran 
firefighters are left uncovered by the 
VA for certain types of cancer treat-
ments. 
Earlier this year, I reintroduced the 
Michael Lecik Military Firefighters 
Protection Act in Mike’s name to fix 
this longstanding issue. This bipartisan 
legislation would make sure diseases 
like Mike’s are recognized as presump-
tive service-connected disabilities. 
By recognizing the long-term effects 
of military firefighting and the dis-
eases that can arise from this career 
over time, our bill would provide much- 
needed peace of mind and security to 
thousands of veteran firefighters and 
their families. It would lift an undue 
burden off thousands of veterans expe-
riencing severe and often-terminal ill-
nesses. 
Right now, the VA doesn’t cover sig-
nificant treatment costs like those 
faced by Mike, as the VA, in many 
cases, does not recognize the direct 
service connection between firefighting 
and cancer as a presumptive service- 
connected disability beyond 1 year fol-
lowing Active Duty. 
Our legislation would establish the 
presumption that veteran firefighters 
who become disabled by serious dis-
eases, including heart disease, lung dis-
ease, and certain cancers like Mike’s, 
within 15 years of separating from Ac-
tive Duty contracted the illness due to 
their service in the military. 
By creating this presumption, the VA 
would be required to provide equitable 
disability benefits and treatment cost 
coverage to veteran firefighters like 
Mike. 
This legislation has the support of 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
from 
across the political spectrum, includ-
ing many who have served our country. 
Specifically, I would like to thank 
my Republican colleague, Congressman 
BACON from Nebraska, himself an Air 
Force veteran of nearly 30 years, for 
his continued partnership in leading 
this bill. I thank Congressman BACON 
for recognizing that this issue should 
unite us all because we all represent 
veterans with stories like Mike’s. 
Even as he was engaged in the battle 
of his life—for his life—Mike was eager 
to make progress on this issue. When I 
first reached out to Mike to ask wheth-
er he would like to be involved with 
the legislation, he never hesitated. 
Mike had already been in touch with 
our team about some of his issues with 
the VA. And when asked if he wanted 
to take up this challenge and make a 
difference through the legislative proc-
ess, he said: ‘‘Absolutely.’’ He was 
ready to take up the mantle for his fel-
low vets. It was his honor. 
Even as his illness progressed, he 
stayed apprised of new developments 
on this legislation, and my team was 
humbled to work with him. He showed 
incredible strength and determination 
that we will never forget. 
The Michael Lecik Military Fire-
fighters Protection Act is about a fun-
damental question: How do we show 
our gratitude and appreciation to those 
who served, to those who have put on 
the uniform, and to those who have 
worked under hazardous and dangerous 
conditions to keep their countrymen 
and fellow servicemembers safe? 
The answer is found beyond plati-
tudes. It is found beyond spoken prom-
ises. It is found in action. And it is 
found in delivering the benefits our 
veterans have earned through their 
sacrifice. 
No veteran who puts on the uniform 
should repeatedly have to make the ar-
gument that their injury, their illness, 
is connected to their service when the 
evidence is so apparent—to the degree 
that the majority of our States have 
already recognized the link between 
these serious diseases and the occupa-
tional hazards of firefighting and have 
enacted presumptive disability laws. 
In the case of Mike and thousands of 
firefighters like him, no veteran should 
experience a VA that refuses to help 
cover the costs of treating their serv-
ice-connected cancer. 
As I urge my colleagues to recognize 
the urgent need to pass the Michael 
Lecik Military Firefighters Protection 
Act, I am thinking of his wife, Tiffany, 
and his three daughters, Amery, Au-
brey, and Addy. He loved them deeply, 
and I work in his honor.

STANDING WITH ISRAEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to express my unwavering sup-
port for the United States’ greatest 
ally in the Middle East and the region’s 
only democracy, Israel. 
When I visited the region, I saw first-
hand the proximity of the danger 
Israelis face on a daily basis. 
With the Gaza Strip controlled by 
the Iranian-funded terror group Hamas, 
rockets are always pointing at the 
Jewish state. It is estimated that the 
militant group has more than 30,000 
rockets and mortars at their disposal. 
For the past week, Israel and its peo-
ple have been bombarded by more than 
3,000 rockets launched from within 
Gaza. Thank goodness for the Iron 
Dome, 
which, 
despite 
being 
over-
whelmed, saved countless lives. 
While some on the other side of the 
aisle and in the media attempt to draw 
a moral parallel between Hamas and 
Israel, there is simply no comparison 
to be made. 
As 
Prime 
Minister 
Benjamin 
Netanyahu said: ‘‘You cannot equate a 
democracy that values life with a ter-
ror organization that glorifies death.’’ 
Israel has an absolute right to defend 
itself, and while they make every effort 
to keep Palestinian civilians from 
harm, 
Hamas 
continues 
to 
inten-
tionally 
target 
population 
centers, 
seeking death and destruction. 
Hamas is not interested in peace. 
They are not interested in working to-
ward a lasting solution. Their only ob-
jective is to eliminate the Jewish 
state. 
Why some would choose to back 
Hamas despite its atrocious human 
rights record is beyond me. Why back a 
regime that stifles free speech, pros-
ecutes and assaults the press, treats 
women as second-class citizens, and 
has laws on the books that condemn its 
own citizens to death simply for selling 
land to a Jewish person? 
Madam Speaker, it is mind-boggling. 
I stand with Israel, and in doing so, I 
stand for peace. 
CONGRATULATING GRACE CHRISTIAN GOLF TEAM 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, author 
and avid golf fan P.G. Wodehouse once 
remarked: Golf ‘‘is the infallible test. 
The man who can go into a patch of 
rough alone, with the knowledge that 
only God is watching him, and play his 
ball where it lies is the man who will 
serve you faithfully and well.’’ 
Fittingly, I rise today to recognize 
Grace Christian School of Staunton, 
whose golf team won its first Virginia 
Association 
of 
Christian 
Athletics 
State championship. 
The Warriors shot an 18-hole total of 
355 in the championship tournament at 
the Club at Ironwood to overcome its 
closest competitor by 32 strokes. 
Caleb Maas led the Warriors with an 
impressive 86, while Preston Fitzgerald 
and Maddie Helmick each shot a pair of 
87s, with Isaiah Farlow carding a 95. 
Maas, Fitzgerald, and Helmick were 
also named to the all-State team for 
their performances throughout the sea-
son. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 
athletes, coaches, and staff on an excel-
lent season. I wish them all the best of 
luck moving forward. And keep hitting 
them straight. 
f 
NEW INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Ms. Bordeaux) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Madam Speaker, 
like so many of us in this Chamber, I 
spend a lot of time on the road driving 
from event to event. 
As 
someone 
who 
represents 
the 
metro Atlanta area, I have spent far 
more hours than I care to admit sitting 
on I–85 in bumper-to-bumper traffic. 
My staff have all had the experience of 
being on the phone with me as I pull off 
the road and try to find a spot with a 
strong signal in order to call into 
events because there is just no way I 
will make it in time with all the traf-
fic. 
Congestion is one of the issues we all 
hear about with frequency. It is not a 
Republican 
issue 
or 
a 
Democratic 
issue. It is a question I get frequently, 
regardless of whether I am at a town-
hall, speaking to a Chamber of Com-
merce, or visiting a small business: 
What is being done to ease congestion? 
This question is particularly impor-
tant as we continue to have a national 
conversation on infrastructure. Having 
spent my career in public policy and 
public finance, I know how important 
it is that we make smart investments 
today to set us up for success tomor-
row. 
That is why recently I rolled out my 
infrastructure 
agenda. 
I 
call 
it 
FutureFit The Suburbs. 
FutureFit The Suburbs is a vision to 
address our growing needs in the sub-
urbs to make smart investments now 
to prepare for the next century, from 
preparing for the impact of climate 
change to building the transit system 
of tomorrow. 
This agenda focuses on the needs of 
fast-growing suburbs, recognizing the 
need for transit and congestion relief 
in order to maintain economic viabil-
ity while addressing the climate crisis, 
and doing all of it in a way that 
leverages public-private partnerships 
in a fiscally responsible manner. 
The key is to do well by doing good. 
This initial launch of FutureFit The 
Suburbs contains four initiatives. 
First, I am proud to be introducing a 
new piece of bipartisan legislation 
today, the Build Up the Suburbs Act, 
along 
with 
Congressman 
CARLos 
Gimenez from Florida, and my Georgia 
colleague, 
Congresswoman 
LUCY 
MCBATH. 
Imagine a regional bus rapid transit 
system that would run along our major 
highways and express lanes, developing 
an electric bus equivalent of commuter 
rail to help people get from suburban 
hubs to major commercial hubs while 
skipping the traffic. The Build Up the 
Suburbs Act would fund exactly that. 
The next time you need to go to the 
airport, wouldn’t it be easier if you 
didn’t have to budget in an extra hour 
or two just to get there? 
Tomorrow, I will be introducing the 
National and Regional Greenways Act 
to provide funding for the construction 
and expansion of greenways across the 
country, corridors of land connecting 
disparate communities with beautiful 
recreational 
space 
and 
environ-
mentally friendly travel routes, there-
by reducing congestion and emissions. 
This program would support projects 
like the visionary Chattahoochee River 
Greenway, a proposed multiuse path 
that would run along the Chattahoo-
chee River in Georgia. 
Beyond immediate transit priorities, 
FutureFit The Suburbs focuses on how 
we can be smart in leveraging the 
power of public-private partnerships to 
maximize available resources. For ex-
ample, as more and more shopping goes 
online, retail malls, and the large plots 
of land that they sit on, are going un-
occupied and unused, taking up valu-
able real estate. Through low-interest 
and guaranteed loan programs, these 
areas can be restored in a way that 
serves the community. 
Finally, creating a national infra-
structure bank would provide Federal 
seed money to leverage significant pri-
vate sector investment in major infra-
structure projects. Private investment 
is on the sidelines and looking to in-
vest in our roads, bridges, broadband, 
and electric charging infrastructure. 
Change is coming, whether we like it 
or not. We can make smart invest-
ments now that enhance our quality of 
life, or we can spend a lot more time, 
money, and effort retrofitting the same 
projects years down the road. 
By investing now, we can help slow 
the effects of climate change, create 
jobs, and position the suburbs for suc-
cess in the years to come.

CELEBRATING JULIA TUCKER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure being here today. As we 
say in east Tennessee, you class up the 
joint. Thank you for allowing me to be 
here. 
Today, I rise to celebrate the 90th 
birthday of one of my dearest friends, 
Julia Tucker, 90 years old. 
Julia has served the Knoxville com-
munity in many different ways over 
the years. Julia was the first woman to 
chair the Knoxville City School Board, 
where she served with my daddy. 
Julia is a force to be reckoned with, 
and she fights for things that are im-
portant to her. Julia once saved her 
unconscious neighbors’ lives during a 
gas leak by dragging them out of their 
house.

Since Julia’s son, Bill, lost his tragic 
battle with AIDS in 1991, Julia has 
dedicated her life to raising money and 
awareness to combat the disease and 
also to fight the bigotry. I still have 
his minibike, a ‘‘Lil’’ Indian, in my col-
lection, and I treasure it very much. 
Julia also honored her son by build-
ing Williamswood Castle, which is a 
castle modeled after a Scottish hunting 
lodge, in Knoxville, Tennessee, Madam 
Speaker. Bill was a historic preserva-
tionist way before his time. People 
weren’t doing things like that, and Bill 
kind of set the mark for it. Bill was in-
credibly proud of his family’s Scottish 
heritage, and this castle is a unique 
way for Julia to preserve her son’s 
memory. 
Julia allowed my sweet little girl, 
Isabelle, to have her birthday party 
there, and it was magical. 
Julia also serves on committees and 
boards for local organizations. Julia 
adopts orphan dogs—I guess me being 
one of them—and fiercely loves her 
family and friends. 
When I was mayor of Knox County, I 
had the privilege of publicly recog-
nizing Julia’s exemplary work in the 
community, and now I am pleased to 
stand on the House floor and wish her 
a happy 90th birthday. 
Julia was the first person I knew who 
had cable TV. She introduced me to 
Shirley Temples and rare roast beef 
sandwiches when I was a little boy. 
Madam Speaker, I wish Julia a happy 
birthday. Julia is loved by many peo-
ple, and especially the Burchetts.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF CORPORAL ROLLEN 
DELANO BRADSHAW 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor Corporal Rollen 
Delano Bradshaw, an American hero 
and Korean War veteran, as Ten-
nessee’s 
Second 
Congressional 
Dis-
trict’s Veteran of the Month. 
Corporal 
Bradshaw 
was 
rejected 
three times from joining the military 
during the Korean War because of his 
partial blindness, but he didn’t let that 
get in the way of his patriotism. With 
just a seventh-grade education and a 
whole lot of persistence, he memorized 
the eye chart and was accepted into 
the United States Army on his fourth 
attempt. 
Corporal Bradshaw served in Korea 
for 18 months, where he worked as a 
postal clerk delivering mail to his fel-
low soldiers. While deployed, Corporal 
Bradshaw earned the Korean Service 
Medal with Bronze Star, the United 
Nations Service Medal, National De-
fense Service Medal, Meritorious Unit 
Commendation, and the Republic of 
Korea Presidential Unit Citation. 
Following his service, Corporal Brad-
shaw spent 17 years in American Le-
gion leadership roles, serving as com-
mander at Post 120 for 15 years and as 
Tennessee’s national executive com-
mitteeman for 20 years. 
Corporal Bradshaw remains dedicated 
to his military fraternity to this day. 
Every year, he coordinates Loudon 
County’s Memorial Day and Veteran’s 
Day ceremonies. Our country’s heroes 
are the men and women of our Armed 
Forces and those that wear our coun-
try’s badges, like Corporal Rollen D. 
Bradshaw, who served and sacrificed 
for our freedom. 
Thank you for your service. And, 
brother, I am truly sorry to hear about 
the passing of your sweet wife.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF JOHN 
EADE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as 
our Nation approaches Memorial Day 
2021, I am deeply privileged to enter 
into the CONGRESSIONAL
RECORD
the 
true story of a great soldier and an ag-
onizing battle during the War in Viet-
nam. 
The story recounts the superhuman 
valor of a great army soldier named 
John Eade, heroic son of my hometown 
of Toledo, Ohio. John is held in the 
highest esteem by all who know him. 
He is a faithful friend and a true pa-
triot, a superlatively strong soldier, 
yet a humble decorated warrior for lib-
erty. Yes, he is a Purple Heart and 
more. He has been tested beyond 
human limits his entire life. He has tri-
umphed against overwhelming odds, in-
cluding lifelong war wounds, time and 
time again. 
In November 1965, Sergeant John 
Eade, then 21, was deployed in Viet-
nam, a fire team leader in the 1st Cal-
vary division and its ill-fated 2nd Pla-
toon, Alpha Company. On November 14, 
1965, Sergeant Eade and his team were 
sent to reinforce their sister battalion 
that was engaged in very heavy fight-
ing at Landing Zone X-Ray in La 
Drang Valley. Two days later, believ-
ing the enemy was destroyed and the 
worst fighting seemingly over, the 1st 
and 2nd Platoons Bravo were all 
choppered out. But John Eade and his 
team left Landing Zone X-ray the 
morning of November 17, marching 10 
kilometers to nearby Landing Zone Al-
bany. They were the first to arrive. 
They established the command post 
and defense perimeter, and other com-
panies were still coming up the trail. 
Sergeant Eade, with Alpha’s 2nd Pla-
toon, was sent into the trees to the left 
while the 1st Platoon went right. That 
is when the two much larger North Vi-
etnamese regiments encamped nearby 
attacked. 
Sergeant Eade’s platoon was imme-
diately pinned down in ferocious hand- 
to-hand combat as the North Viet-
namese 
swarmed 
down 
on 
them 
through the trees. Sergeant Eade re-
flected, ‘‘it was like a gang fight. It 
was small groups of us versus small 
groups of them. It got down to knives. 
It got down to choking people.’’ 
Sergeant Eade and his team, Wilbert 
Johnson, Barry Burnite, and Oscar 
Barker, Jr., tried to outflank the at-
tacking Vietnamese but were badly 
outnumbered. Eade recounts: ‘‘Burnite, 
a machine gunner, was hit in the chest 
by shrapnel and his gun was disabled. 
Johnson, his crewman, dragged Burnite 
30 meters back to a position of cover in 
an effort to save him.’’ Eade recounted, 
‘‘It was the greatest feat of human 
strength I have ever witnessed. I don’t 
know if Burnite was still alive.’’ 
Johnson 
and 
Barker 
holed 
up 
amongst some trees and continued to 
fight. Johnson was killed and Eade was 
shot in the gut and the right shoulder, 
forcing him to fire his M–16 left-hand-
ed. Under RPC fire, Eade said his legs 
and boots were sprayed with shrapnel 
that left a large piece stuck in his foot, 
leaving him unable to walk. 
Barker tended to Eade’s wounds. Ev-
eryone else was dead. Eade urged Bark-
er to flee 50 meters beyond the woods 
where the command element was situ-
ated. Barker refused. Shortly there-
after, Barker was shot and Eade at-
tended him as he slowly died. Eade 
later reflected: ‘‘I don’t think anyone 
who studies war doesn’t get stuck on 
the Battle of Thermopylae. It is that 
thing of standing our ground to the 
last man. If you had your chance to cut 
out or stay, you would have stayed.’’ 
Despite some misgivings, according 
to official records, the U.S. Command 
Post called in a napalm strike on Ser-
geant Eade’s position. As a result, Ser-
geant Eade was set on fire and severely 
burned because of the air strike. He 
was further weakened but still alive. 
He managed to roll in the dirt to put 
out the flames. 
Sergeant Eade recalled that, among 
his problems, the napalm proved incon-
sequential. In fact, he said, ‘‘the na-
palm served a purpose by flushing the 
enemy out and gave me an opportunity 
to reduce the Vietcong numbers.’’ 
Later in the afternoon, still con-
scious but bleeding, he said he was sur-
prised by the sudden appearance of 
three 
enemy 
soldiers 
behind 
him. 
‘‘There were three North Vietnamese 
looking at me, one with a pistol.’’ Eade 
said he shot and killed two, but was 
shot in the face by the one with the 
pistol. 
The small caliber bullet destroyed 
his right eye socket and shattered 
parts of the sinus, making it difficult 
to breathe. He was knocked uncon-
scious. When he came to, the third Vi-
etnamese was gone. 
Small groups of North Vietnamese 
continued moving through the area 
until about midnight, Eade said. And 
he stopped using his rifle after dark so 
he wouldn’t give away his position. He 
said he managed to crawl around and 
throw grenades at some parties he as-
sumed were removing their dead after 
midnight. The enemy activity ended. 
He recalls it was a struggle to stay 
awake. He was on his third night with-
out sleep and believed if he fell asleep, 
he would be found and killed. 
Dawn came. He was still alive, 
though horribly wounded. Around 9 or 
10 in the morning, Infantryman Eade

said he heard someone moving toward 
him. He prepared to shoot but held his 
fire and then saw the shape of an 
American helmet. 
‘‘I yelled at them, ‘Give me some 
water.’ I was really thirsty. He looked 
at me and said, ‘You’re shot in the 
stomach. I can’t give you water.’ I told 
him I had been drinking water all 
night. But the soldier said ‘no.’ So I 
asked him for some morphine. I told 
him I used mine up on the other 
wounded. It really hurts. The soldier 
said: ‘You are shot in the head. I can’t 
give you morphine.’ So I said, ‘Well, 
give me a cigarette.’ They gave me 
that. And he said he never stopped 
smoking after that.’’ 
John Eade was awarded the Purple 
Heart. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the entire story of John Eade, 
a great American soldier. 
JOHN EADE: ‘‘I AM GOING TO DIE WELL’’ 
[From the Boston Herald, Nov. 15, 2010] 
(By Jules Crittenden) 
There are people who have the ability to 
surprise you with the evidence, against long 
odds, that it is possible to retain a sense of 
wonder, some ideals and even wistful dreams, 
when cynicism, demons and nightmares 
should have won out a long time ago. 
John Eade is like that, the kind of person 
you’re always glad to see. You know you’ll 
walk away with a little of that energy he 
barely manages to conceal behind a quiet fa-
cade, still retaining in his 60s—despite severe 
war wounds—an infantryman’s ability to 
walk 25 miles on short notice. 
And you know Eade will always leave you 
with something to think about—like what he 
had say about the Spartans at Thermopylae, 
when the movie ‘‘300’’ came out a few years 
back. 
It came up in one of our late-night phone 
conversations. Eade said he had been cap-
tivated by the story when he was in high 
school in Toledo, Ohio. Forty-odd years 
later, he was still. 
‘‘I don’t think anyone who studies war 
doesn’t get stuck on Thermopylae. It’s that 
thing of standing your ground to the last 
man,’’ Eade said. ‘‘Three days of fighting set 
up the Persians for their ultimate defeat. It 
changed history. It has taken on mythic pro-
portions. You want to be one of the 300. If 
you had your chance to cut out or stay, 
you’d have stayed.’’ 
Eade said it almost casually, like any of us 
would do that. Most people can only wonder 
if they would. But Eade knows what he is 
talking about. He’s an authority on the sub-
ject. 
In November 1965, Sgt. John Eade, then 21, 
was in Vietnam, among the first American 
regulars there, a fire-team leader in 2nd Pla-
toon, Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion of the 
historically ill-fated 7th Cavalry Regiment, 
1st Cavalry Division. They had already seen 
some combat, and as former paratroopers 
turned Air Cav, were a confident, well- 
trained and cohesive unit. 
Over Nov. 14, 15, and 16, elements of 2/7 Cav 
were sent in to reinforce its sister battalion, 
1/7 Cav, in the heavy fight at Landing Zone 
X-ray in the la Orang valley, where a recon-
naissance in force had encountered a large 
force of North Vietnamese regulars. On the 
16th, with the enemy at X-ray destroyed and 
the worst seemingly over, 1/7 was choppered 
out, along with 2/7’s Bravo. The rest of 2/7, 
with a company of 1/5 Cav, left X-ray the 
morning of Nov. 17, marching 10 kilometers 
to Landing Zone Albany. Just short of Al-
bany, the lead elements captured a couple of 
North Vietnamese soldiers. There was debate 
about whether they were deserters or an out-
post. 
Still mulling the implications, they moved 
on, the battalion CO calling his company 
commanders ahead for a conference. In Alba-
ny’s clearing of grassland and anthills, sur-
rounded by forest, 2/7’s Alpha Company 
began establishing a command post and a de-
fensive perimeter within which the heli-
copters could land and take them home. The 
battalion’s Delta, Charlie and Headquarters 
companies were still coming up the trail be-
hind them, with 1/5’s Alpha company bring-
ing up the rear. Eade, with Alpha’s 2nd Pla-
toon, was sent into the trees to the left, 
while 1st Platoon went right. That’s when 
the two North Vietnamese regiments en-
camped nearby attacked, along the length of 
the column. 
Eade discussed his experience with me five 
years ago for a Boston Herald article. It was 
the first time he had done so in a public 
venue. He recalled that his platoon was im-
mediately pinned down in ferocious fighting 
as the North Vietnamese swarmed on them 
through the trees. 
‘‘For the first hour and a half, it was in-
tense hand-to-hand,’’ Eade said. ‘‘It was like 
a gang fight. It was small groups of us versus 
small groups of them. It got down to knives. 
It got down to choking people.’’ 
First and 2nd platoons were taking the 
brunt of the attack on the landing zone’s pe-
rimeter. Delta, Charlie, HQ and 1/5 Alpha 
companies, strung out along the trail, were 
also under heavy attack, with similar scenes 
of desperate combat playing out as hundreds 
of men, American and Vietnamese, engaged 
among the trees. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese 
who had cut off the column were directly as-
saulting the Alpha’s command post among 
some anthills in the middle of the clearing. 
Eade said he and his fire team, Wilbert 
Johnson, Barry Burnite and Oscar Barker 
Jr., had some freedom of movement along a 
line of brush and tried to flank the attacking 
Vietnamese. 
‘‘We wanted to hunt them down and give 
the platoon a chance,’’ Eade said. ‘‘We bit off 
more than we could chew.’’ 
Burnite, a machine gunner, was hit in the 
chest by shrapnel and his gun was disabled. 
Johnson, his crewman, dragged Burnite 30 
meters back to a position of cover in an ef-
fort to save him. 
‘‘It was the greatest feat of human 
strength I have ever witnessed,’’ Eade said. 
‘‘I don’t know if Burnite was still alive.’’ 
Eade said he, Johnson and Barker holed up 
among some trees and continued to fight. 
Johnson was killed, and Eade was shot in the 
gut and the right shoulder, forcing him to 
fire his M–16 left-handed. Under RPG and 
mortar fire, Eade said his legs and boots 
were sprayed with shrapnel that left a large 
piece stuck into his foot, so he couldn’t 
walk. 
By about 3 p.m., much of the fighting had 
subsided around the fire team’s two sur-
vivors, Barker and Eade. Barker tended to 
Eade’s wounds in the lull, stuffing one of 
Eade’s dirty socks into his shoulder wound 
to stop the bleeding because they were out of 
bandages. 
‘‘I knew and he knew that everyone else 
was dead,’’ Eade said. He said he urged Bark-
er to try to save himself and run for the 
command post, which Eade estimates was lo-
cated about 50 meters of open ground beyond 
the woods, where the command element and 
mortars still held a perimeter. 
‘‘He refused to go,’’ Eade said. Shortly 
after that, Barker was shot, and Eade had to 
watch him die. It was a sucking chest wound, 
and it took a long time, Eade said. 
After Barker died, Eade was alone. 
‘‘My whole life, I’ve missed the people I 
was with,’’ Eade said at that point in the 
conversation. ‘‘I just miss them a lot.’’ 
I asked him what his thoughts and emo-
tions were at this time, as the last surviving 
man in his position with every expectation 
that he would be killed as the Vietnamese 
moved through the trees finishing off the 
wounded. I was under the impression that 
Eade had played dead to survive, but he said 
that wasn’t the case. 
‘‘Playing dead was a way to die. It made no 
sense to me. Our job was to hold that posi-
tion and kill the enemy,’’ Eade said. ‘‘I had 
this thing in my mind, part of the U.S. 
Army’s General Orders and the soldier’s code 
you learn in boot camp: ‘I will never forget 
I am an American fighting man. I will never 
surrender of my own free will. I will continue 
to resist to the utmost of my ability. I will 
not leave my post until properly relieved.’ ’’ 
Eade said he kept repeating it himself. 
‘‘I don’t think it was unique to me,’’ Eade 
said, citing the actions of men like Barker 
and Johnson. He said his seemingly hopeless 
position was made easier by his belief, estab-
lished weeks earlier after several men in the 
unit were killed in other actions, that he 
would not leave Vietnam alive. What Eade 
says about that may sound familiar to other 
veterans of heavy combat: 
‘‘It wasn’t a matter of living or dying. It 
was taking care of each other and doing your 
duty. The anticipation of a future is what 
you give up. The question was not, ‘Am I 
going to die?’ We all know the answer to 
that. The question was, ’How am I going to 
die? I am going to die well.’ ’’ 
In the command post, Alpha Company’s ex-
ecutive officer, Lt. Larry Gwin, reports they 
saw large groups of the enemy moving 
through 2nd Platoon’s area. The command 
post remained under assault by waves of Vi-
etnamese, still cut off from what was left of 
the rest of the battalion. 
A couple of 2nd Platoon soldiers who had 
made it out of the woods and across the open 
grassland to the command post said they 
didn’t think any Americans were alive in 
there. Despite some misgivings on the part 
of some officers, the decision was made to 
thwart a Vietnamese attack on the com-
mand post by calling in a napalm strike on 
2nd Platoon’s position. 
‘‘I think they made the right decision,’’ 
Eade said. He was on the edge of the A–1 
Skyraiders’ napalm strike. 
‘‘It set me on fire, but I managed to roll in 
the dirt and put it out,’’ Eade said, adding 
that among his problems, the napalm proved 
inconsequential. In fact, he said, the napalm 
served a purpose. ‘‘It flushed them out and 
gave me an opportunity to reduce the num-
bers.’’ 
Later in the afternoon, Eade said he was 
surprised by the sudden appearance of three 
enemy soldiers behind him. 
‘‘There were three North Vietnamese look-
ing at me, one with a pistol.’’ Eade said he 
shot and killed two, but was shot in the face 
by the one with the pistol. The small-caliber 
bullet destroyed his right eye socket and 
shattered parts of his sinuses, making it dif-
ficult to breathe. He was knocked uncon-
scious, and when he came to, the third Viet-
namese was gone. 
‘‘I was angry at myself for being shot in 
the head. I was angry at myself for being 
careless. I was really pissed off at the North 
Vietnamese. It was probably the most ma-
niacal moment of my life,’’ Eade said. He de-
clined to elaborate. 
Small groups of North Vietnamese contin-
ued moving through the area until about 
midnight, Eade said. He said he stopped 
using his rifle after dark so he wouldn’t give 
away his position. He said he managed to 
crawl around and throw grenades at some

parties he assumes were removing their 
dead. 
‘‘There was no shortage of grenades lying 
around,’’ Eade said. 
After midnight, the enemy activity ended. 
He recalls that it was a struggle to stay 
awake. He was on his third night without 
sleep, and believed that if he fell asleep, he 
would be found and killed. 
Dawn came. He was alive, though severely 
wounded. Around 9 or 10 in the morning, 
Eade said he heard someone moving toward 
him. He prepared to shoot, but held his fire. 
Then he saw the shape of an American hel-
met. 
‘‘I yelled at them, ‘Give me some water!’ ’’ 
Eade said. ‘‘I was really thirsty. He looked at 
me and said, ‘You’re shot in the stomach. I 
can’t give you water.’ I told him I had been 
drinking water all night, but he said no. So 
I asked him for some morphine. I told him I 
had used mine up on the other wounded. ‘It 
really hurts,’ I said. He said, ‘You’re shot in 
the head. I can’t give you morphine.’ So I 
said, ‘Well, then give me a cigarette.’ They 
gave me that.’’ 
He said he had never smoked before, but 
hasn’t stopped since. 
Eade’s experience was similar to what hun-
dreds of men up and down the column experi-
enced over the prior afternoon and night, 
though many did not survive the first few 
hours after the Vietnamese broke through 
and enveloped them shortly after 1 p.m. on 
the 17th. 
Gwin, who remembers firing at the oncom-
ing Vietnamese, and firing again to keep 
them down, has said he is haunted by the 
memory of the American dead that he saw 
strewn across the grassland and throughout 
the trees on the morning of the 18th. He re-
ports that the discovery of Eade alive where 
2nd Platoon had been destroyed was a tre-
mendous morale booster for the survivors. 
When the battle was over, Gwin said, the 
battalion that had marched to LZ Albany 
could fit into four deuce and a half trucks. 
Nearly three-quarters of them had been 
killed or wounded in a matter of hours. But 
he said that despite the trauma, morale was 
high and remained so in following weeks as 
replacements rotated into nearly empty pla-
toon tents and the battalion prepared to re-
turn to the field. 
‘‘The survivors rallied and cheered the fact 
that we had held the ground. We knew that 
we had killed a lot of them. We had given as 
good as we had gotten,’’ said Gwin. ‘‘The mo-
rale was very high in a perverse sort of way, 
because we had survived it.’’ 
Eade objects to the notion that his pla-
toon, while largely destroyed, was overrun. 
He argues that he stayed alive, kept fight-
ing, and remained in position. His platoon 
held. 
Gwin, noting that 2/7 Cav held its ground 
in one of the bloodiest days any battalion 
has experienced in U.S. military history, 
said, ‘‘John’s platoon held. If they hadn’t 
done what they did, we would have been 
overrun.’’ 
Eade was medevac’d, and none of his com-
rades saw him again for decades. Gwin said 
that years later after they were reunited, he 
and other la Orang vets tried to get a combat 
award for Eade. Gwin, who earned a Silver 
Star for his actions at LZ Albany and com-
pleted 45 combat assaults in his year in Viet-
nam, said he believes Eade’s actions merit a 
Distinguished Service Cross. But because 
there were no living American witnesses to 
Eade’s actions, Gwin said, the effort was un-
successful. Eade himself has said, regarding 
decorations, he is satisfied with the Combat 
Infantryman’s Badge. 
Eade spent 1966, the year after the la 
Drang, in the U.S. Army hospital at Valley 
Forge. That’s where the mother of his fire 
team’s machine gunner, Barry Burnite, came 
to see him. 
‘‘I don’t know how she found me,’’ Eade 
said. ‘‘She asked me, how did her son die? I 
kind of told her the truth and I kind of 
didn’t. I cleaned it up a bit. The uncontrol-
lable grief of that woman has stayed with me 
my whole life. Her pain and her grief was 
more than I could bear to look at. I can 
never think about it without wanting to 
cry.’’ 
Eade, though battered and disfigured, re-
covered and went to university in the late 
1960s. He became an architect. He pursued a 
career through what he called ‘‘serial jobs,’’ 
staying only until he became restless or 
angry, and moving on. He was largely soli-
tary, and to this day closely guards his pri-
vacy. Eade became chief of inspectional serv-
ices for the City of Boston in the 1990s, which 
is where I first met him. A lightly built, soft- 
spoken man with an eyepatch, an unexpected 
character in City Hall, a little odd and en-
gaging. Serious about his work, he had a rep-
utation for toughness and honesty. I only 
learned about his history several years later, 
and then it was by odd coincidence, through 
Gwin, our mutual friend, by then the infor-
mal head of a small informal group of com-
bat veterans, some Boston lawyers and in-
vestment bankers who form a sort of mov-
able VFW down in the businesss district. 
Gwin had seen Eade’s name in a local 
newspaper article and sought him out. Eade 
had been out of touch with his fellow la 
Drang vets for nearly 40 years, having made 
no effort to get in touch. 
‘‘You have to understand. All my friends 
were dead,’’ Eade explained. 
It was one of those typical silver-bullet 
Eade statements. He has a gift, or maybe the 
curse for it. Unsentimentally, matter-of- 
factly plumbing a terrible depth of human 
experience in a few words. 
These days, Eade seems to have friends ev-
erywhere he goes. There is always someone 
who walks up, glad to see him, when we walk 
through the city. They say little things 
about him in brief asides, something he did 
one time or another. I don’t know how many 
of them know that this quiet, gentle man is 
still a soldier, prouder of nothing more than 
to have been an American combat infantry-
man who held his ground. 
f 
THE KLAMATH PROJECT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
want to speak a little while today on 
the issue going on with the Klamath 
Basin, which straddles Northern Cali-
fornia and Southern Oregon, and the 
water supply that has been a long-time 
issue and dispute up there for many 
purposes, 
agriculture, 
hydroelectric 
power, and endangered fish species, and 
how these are going to be shared, adju-
dicated, et cetera. 
Currently, the battle in the basin 
there is how waters can be delivered to 
agriculture. Last year, in 2020, the situ-
ation was very dire where, initially, 
140,000 acre-feet was promised to the 
growers up there. And then they went 
ahead and started their planning proc-
ess. They had their crops in the field 
based on that number. The Bureau of 
Reclamation decided they were going 
to pull that back and not deliver that 
water. 
We were able to work with the De-
partment of the Interior and restore 
that water so that the crops that are 
already in the field planted would not 
die, that massive investment and mas-
sive loss to the farmers and to the com-
munity would not happen. 
This year, we have a similar path. In 
March, the Bureau estimated they 
would deliver 130,000 acre-feet of water, 
10,000 acre-feet less than last year. This 
of a water right that belongs in the 
basin of 390,000 acre-feet when fully de-
livered. 
And that is where we need to really 
discuss this today, is that we are talk-
ing about the elevation of the lake 
here. We have, at the full mark, 4,143.3 
elevation is a maximum lake. The 
project goes as low as 4,136 right down 
here. So that represents a heck of a lot 
of water. The farmer’s share of this, 
the 561 is the 390,000 I had mentioned. 
Currently, the lake sits at 4,140.4 feet 
of elevation, so that represents avail-
ability of 307,000 acre-feet of water sup-
ply. 
Now, the species of fish that we are 
talking about here are the longnose 
sucker fish that is in the lake. It lives 
in the lower part, the brown area of the 
lake there. And that is where it is best- 
suited. It is a bottom-feeding fish. 
So the problem is that the Bureau of 
Reclamation, taking the cue from U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife, has decided that the 
water that belongs to the farmers has 
been adjudicated over time. The Or-
egon courts have held that these water 
rights do belong to agriculture. This is 
after NEPA and the ESA went into ef-
fect in the Endangered Species Act Or-
egon 
Water 
Resources 
Department 
began the process of detailing and adju-
dicating these rights. 
So in reviewing the water rights of 
all the users in the basin, they noted 
that the Bureau claimed the reserved 
water rights apply only to the primary 
purpose of that water right, which is 
determined by a 1978 case, U.S. vs. New 
Mexico. 
The Ninth Circuit determined in a 
1983 case, the U.S. vs. Adair, that this 
land’s reservation was for the purpose 
of agriculture. So as we apply that to 
the Klamath Irrigation area, the KID 
took the Bureau of Reclamation to 
court over its decisions to increase 
downstream flows to salmon, as well as 
the retention of water for the sucker 
fish. 
So they want to retain this portion 
here for the sucker fish even though 
this portion of water does not belong to 
the Bureau or Fish and Wildlife to use 
for that purpose. 
This project was created over 100 
years ago for agriculture, to deliver 
water down this A Canal through a 
whole entire system there. This dam 
was completed, the Link River Dam, in 
1921, to help regulate that source. 
So in the process of Klamath Irriga-
tion District having taken them to 
court, the State ultimately agreed 
with KID that the Bureau has the right 
to store the water and administer the

water in Upper Lake, but the Bureau of 
Reclamation does not have the permit, 
the license, the right to use the water 
themselves for salmon in the river or 
for the sucker fish that stay in the 
lake. 
Going further, Section 8 of the Rec-
lamation Act clearly states that the 
Federal Government cannot interfere 
with the laws of States relating to the 
control or distribution of water used in 
irrigation. 
So in 1978, California vs. the U.S. cer-
tified that a State can impose require-
ments under distribution of water 
through a Federal reclamation project 
as long as they are consistent with 
clear Congressional directives as Con-
gress set this back up over 100 years 
ago and ongoing. The Congress has 
made it clear multiple times that the 
Klamath Project was designed and es-
tablished for irrigation. 
So if you want to concede just for a 
moment, playing along with Fish and 
Wildlife, that the current level at 
4,140.4, and you take it down to 4,138, 
there is 173,000 acre-feet of water avail-
able for farmers right now that should 
not be taken, even if you concede the 
sucker fish total. 
So we have got giant problems in the 
basin. 
f 
MATERNAL MORTALITY CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. KELLY) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, we are in the midst of a 
shameful healthcare crisis. In 2021, 
there is no reason that giving birth 
should be more dangerous for women 
today than it was for their mothers. 
Despite declining rates and maternal 
mortality around the world, in the 
United States, the rates have been 
climbing in recent years. Decades of in-
stitutional racism in our society and 
our healthcare system have brought us 
to this moment. 
Data released by the CDC last month 
shows that the maternal mortality cri-
sis is only worsening, and the risks are 
even greater for Black women and 
other women of color. Black women are 
three times more likely, and indige-
nous women are more than twice as 
likely to die from pregnancy-related 
causes as non-Hispanic women. Even 
worse, more than two-thirds of the 
deaths are preventable. 
Additionally, the rates of pregnancy- 
related complications are on the rise. 
And for every maternal death in the 
United States, there are approximately 
100 women who experience severe ma-
ternal morbidity, or a ‘‘near miss.’’ 
As chair of the Congressional Black 
Caucus Health Braintrust and co-chair 
of the Congressional Caucus on Black 
Women and Girls, I have seen so many 
examples of how the healthcare system 
fails Black women. 
Maternal mortality is a complex cri-
sis with inequities stemming from 
many factors, including access to care, 
standardization of care, bias, and rac-
ism. Pregnancy and birth should be one 
of the happiest times for a family, but 
for Black women that is too often not 
the case, and we must take action now 
to begin saving the lives and protecting 
the health of Black women. 
One of the most pressing issues re-
lated to the maternal mortality crisis 
we must address is access to high-qual-
ity, affordable healthcare. We know 
there are major risks associated with 
becoming uninsured shortly after preg-
nancy. 
b 1115 
That is why I fought to have ex-
tended Medicare coverage included in 
the American Rescue Plan, so that 
women are able to receive postpartum 
care up to 1 year after birth instead of 
the existing 60 days of coverage. 
But we need to take additional steps 
to incentivize every single State to 
permanently implement this policy. 
That is why, today, I am introducing 
the Helping Medicaid Offer Maternity 
Services Act, or Helping MOMS Act of 
2021. 
This 
bipartisan 
legislation 
will 
amend the American Rescue Plan to 
provide a permanent State option to 
extend postpartum Medicaid coverage 
from 60 days after delivery to a full 
year. The Helping MOMs Act would 
also authorize a 5 percent Federal med-
ical assistance percentage rate for the 
first year that States adopt extended 
coverage. 
Ensuring healthcare coverage for the 
entirety of the postpartum period will 
save lives and prevent needless com-
plications that endanger the health of 
mothers and their babies. This is an 
important step forward, but is not the 
only change that is needed. 
The Black maternal health crisis is a 
multifactorial epidemic, and solving it 
will require a multifaceted approach. 
That is why, tomorrow, I will reintro-
duce my Mothers and Offspring Mor-
tality and Morbidity Awareness Act, or 
the MOMMA Act. 
This comprehensive bill tackles a 
growing maternal mortality crisis and 
severe morbidity in five ways. The 
MOMMA Act will standardize maternal 
mortality and morbidity data collec-
tion across States and authorize a des-
ignated Federal agency to aggregate 
that data. 
Maternal heath advocates agree that 
standardization of data across the 
country is critical in fully under-
standing this crisis and informing fu-
ture decisions about how to improve 
women’s healthcare. 
This bill will empower the CDC to 
provide technical guidance and publish 
best practices to prevent maternal 
mortality and morbidity. It will au-
thorize evidence-based national obstet-
ric emergency protocol to save moth-
ers’ lives. 
The 
MOMMA 
Act 
will 
expand 
healthcare coverage through the full 
postpartum year after giving birth. 
Finally, the MOMMA Act will ensure 
improved access to culturally com-
petent care training and workforce 
practices throughout the entire deliv-
ery continuum. 
This aspect, in particular, is so im-
portant in addressing the harmful bi-
ases and misconceptions that are, un-
fortunately, persuasive through our 
healthcare 
system, 
but 
especially 
rampant when it comes to Black ma-
ternal health. We have already lost too 
many mothers to this crisis. 
While many of us celebrated Mother’s 
Day just a few weeks ago, families 
across the country mourned lost moth-
ers and babies and remembered trau-
matic and unacceptable birth stories. 
I have talked with husbands who are 
so frustrated with the way their wives 
were treated, and wonder if there is 
something else they could have done to 
protect them. I have heard the heart-
breaking stories of tragedy and loss di-
rectly from these fathers. I have cried 
with them and shared their pain. 
I introduce these bills, the Helping 
MOMS Act and the MOMMA Act, in 
honor of those mothers and families, 
and recommit myself to always fight-
ing for the health and safety of women.

WORKING TO HELP LOUISIANA 
STAND BACK UP 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, it has been 9 months since 
Hurricanes Laura and Delta devastated 
southwest Louisiana. 
Our region has endured natural dis-
aster after natural disaster. This past 
year has been incredibly challenging: 
two very powerful, major hurricanes; a 
crippling ice storm; and this week, on-
going, a severe rainfall event that is 
causing homes and businesses to flood. 
Many families will have to again re-
start the difficult process of rebuilding 
their lives. Our people have been resil-
ient in the face of great adversity, a 
show of incredible strength. 
But the need for help from the Fed-
eral Government is dire. While much 
work has been done, southwest Lou-
isiana has long-term recovery needs. 
To date, we have worked with our Fed-
eral partners to deliver well over $1 bil-
lion in disaster relief to Louisiana, 
with more on the way. 
We 
have 
worked 
with 
President 
Trump and President Biden to secure 
increased Federal assistance through 
cost-share adjustments, now at levels 
of 90 and 100 percent. 
These 
resources 
have 
supported 
southwest Louisiana’s most immediate 
needs: housing and rental assistance, 
utility repairs, debris removal, hazard 
mitigation, and other disaster response 
costs. 
Due to the COVID–19 pandemic and 
related bills, these Federal disaster ac-
counts 
have 
received 
supplemental 
funding well beyond normal appropria-
tions and are still available to the peo-
ple of southwest Louisiana. 
However, our region requires addi-
tional support in the form of long-term

recovery resources, primarily through 
community block grant funding. 
Louisiana’s Governor issued a formal 
request to the Biden administration in 
January of this year. My office has 
supported our Governor’s request in 
every way through every channel. We 
worked for months to build support in 
Congress for long-term recovery re-
sources, and our efforts to build that 
coalition has been successful. 
While that support exists broadly, 
the Biden administration must first re-
spond to our Governor’s official request 
for 
supplemental 
disaster 
funding. 
President Biden must formally request 
specific supplemental disaster relief 
from Congress. Only then can our 
brotherhood of support take action 
here in the House of Representatives. 
That is the way it works. We have com-
municated these extreme needs di-
rectly to the Biden administration and 
House leadership. 
Additionally, the State must do more 
to ensure private insurance companies 
are treating Louisiana citizens fairly. 
This has been a significant issue that 
has frustrated Louisiana citizens and 
hindered our recovery efforts. 
I will not stop fighting for the citi-
zens of south Louisiana, and I ask that 
my colleagues here in this body stand 
with us. I ask that our President stand 
with the people of Louisiana. We are 
one Nation. As a Republic of sovereign 
States, we have never failed to come to 
each other’s rescue in the wake of nat-
ural disaster. Now is one of those mo-
ments. 
This is a time when Americans must 
stand together as one. Every day, we 
are working to help Louisiana stand 
back up. 
f 
VIRGIN ISLANDS ECONOMY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
the Virgin Islands of the United States 
sits at the most southern, most eas-
terly point of the United States. Be-
cause of this geographic position and 
its proximity to South America and its 
almost sentry lighthouse position to 
the rest of the Caribbean, it has been 
fought over; exploited by many na-
tions; owned by seven; and used as a 
base by pirates, privateers, rum and 
drug runners, and even great corpora-
tions. 
Despite so much potential, the bene-
fits of our location, climate, our deep 
ports—one of the deepest in the Carib-
bean, our fertile soil—the people of the 
Virgin Islands have not received equi-
table return on investment and have 
instead been the spoils of others. 
Our people continue to work to cre-
ate economic benefits for our homes, 
jobs, skills, revenue, financial inde-
pendence. Our journey in oil refining is 
one such chapter in that search. 
In the 1960s, the Virgin Islands began 
refining oil. Our island of St. Croix be-
came the second-largest petroleum re-
finery in America. In 2012, the refinery 
closed, exacerbating the shocks of the 
Great Recession, leading to unemploy-
ment rates of 18 percent. Our govern-
ment made the decision to work to 
bring the refinery back and, after sev-
eral years, the terminal and refinery 
reopened. 
In the last few weeks, my office has 
been in contact with the EPA regard-
ing air emissions incidents, odors, and 
emissions around the vicinity of the re-
finery, which threaten the health of 
residents and our environment. 
On 
May 
14, 
the 
EPA 
ordered 
Limetree Bay, the owners of the ter-
minal and refinery, to pause all oper-
ations on the St. Croix refinery due to 
multiple improperly conducted oper-
ations that present an imminent risk 
to public health. Limetree Bay is in a 
community that is disproportionately 
affected by environmental burdens, and 
recent incidents have raised significant 
environmental justice concerns. 
My office has continued to discuss 
with the EPA regarding the shutdown 
of the refinery, which, when fully oper-
ational, contributes tremendously to 
the Virgin Islands’ economy. I have 
also been in contact with the owners of 
the refinery, as well as the Virgin Is-
lands local government, and I will 
share with you all, with this Congress, 
what we can do to rectify the issue. 
But part of my concern and one of 
the reasons I came to Congress was to 
create mechanisms and funding, incen-
tives so that communities like the Vir-
gin Islands, places long-neglected, can 
have the tools, funding, incentives, sta-
ble schools, healthcare, to create di-
verse sustainable industry. 
As I have said in the past, and con-
tinue to reiterate, the current prob-
lems in my community further dem-
onstrate the need for so many commu-
nities like it to have a diversified econ-
omy. This would provide flexibility. A 
diversified economy creates an eco-
nomic health in a community, not tied 
to a single industry or market sector. 
It also creates and supports innova-
tion. 
Not only do companies support one 
another financially, but they engender 
an ecosystem of new ideas and product 
generation. I recognize that funding 
from the American Rescue Plan should 
not only be used by the Virgin Island’s 
government to undergird our most vul-
nerable citizens, our children, mentally 
ill, our seniors; it should be used to 
support creation of clean resilient jobs. 
I and other Democrats recognize that 
we must rebuild our communities and 
our 
economy 
better 
than 
before 
through the American Jobs Plan. Now 
is the time to think boldly with a once- 
in-a-century investment to create mil-
lions of good-paying jobs to ensure 
America can outcompete any other 
country in the world. 
The President has promised to de-
liver clean drinking water, a renewed 
electric grid, high-speed broadband; 
build, preserve, retrofit more than 2 
million homes and commercial build-
ings; modernize our Nation’s schools 
and childcare facilities; upgrade vet-
erans’ hospitals and Federal buildings. 
The President’s plan includes $20 bil-
lion for new programs that will recon-
nect neighborhoods like the Virgin Is-
lands, cut off by historic investments, 
and ensure new projects increase op-
portunity, advance racial equity and 
environmental justice, promote afford-
able access, safeguard critical infra-
structure and services, and defend vul-
nerable communities. 
President Biden will call upon Con-
gress, our body, to ensure that new jobs 
create clean energy, and manufac-
turing and infrastructure are open and 
accessible to women and people of 
color. The House is working on this. 
We have a historic package to build 
back better, creating jobs and justice. 
f 
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank 
our men and women in uniform and re-
member those who gave their life for 
this country. 
The month of May is recognized as 
Military Appreciation Month, and we 
have several days dedicated to hon-
oring our servicemen and -women, as 
well as their families. 
May 7 is Military Spouse Apprecia-
tion Day. May 8 is Victory in Europe 
Day, marking the end of World War II 
in Europe. May 15 is Armed Services 
Day, where we thank Active Duty 
members from all branches of the mili-
tary. 
b 1130 
But on the last day of May, we have 
our most solemn occasion, Memorial 
Day, where we mourn those whom we 
lost in defense of this Nation. 
The tradition of Memorial Day dates 
back to 1864 in Boalsburg, Pennsyl-
vania. 
Three 
ladies 
decorated 
the 
graves of fallen Civil War soldiers, and 
the custom has continued every year 
since then. Boalsburg still puts on a 
traditional Memorial Day celebration, 
complete with a parade, a community 
walk to the cemetery, speeches, mili-
tary reenactments, and much more. 
In the days leading up to Memorial 
Day, many place flags or lay wreaths 
at the graves of our soldiers. We gather 
with friends and family to attend pa-
rades and special services to remember 
those lost. 
As we take the time to thank our Ac-
tive Duty members and remember the 
fallen, we must also never forget the 
soldiers who have not returned home. 
As the father of a wounded warrior, I 
thank God every day he returned home 
safely. Not every family has been as 
lucky, and we owe our greatest efforts 
to recovering the brave men and 
women who made the ultimate sac-
rifice for our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2557 
May 19, 2021 
Currently, there are more than 80,000 
American servicemembers who remain 
unaccounted for, from World War II, 
the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the 
Cold War, and the gulf wars. We must 
uphold our promise to our POW/MIA 
who made the ultimate sacrifice and 
work to return these members home to 
their families. 
That is why today I am introducing 
the Prisoners of War and Missing in 
Action Trade Agreement Resolution. 
As we develop trade ties in regions 
where servicemembers once engaged in 
combat, we must make every effort to 
guarantee these countries are active 
participants in aiding in the recovery 
of our fallen soldiers. While several of 
these nations have worked to assist in 
the research and recovery efforts, 
many challenges still exist. 
This resolution ensures that as we 
enter mutually beneficial trade agree-
ments, our trade partners will commit 
to the research and recovery efforts of 
our Nation’s missing servicemembers. 
In addition, it also sends a message 
to the families of those who are still 
waiting for their loved ones to return 
home. The United States will uphold 
the eternal promise to our Armed 
Forces to always bring our men and 
women home. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this resolution, es-
pecially in advance of Memorial Day 
weekend. As Memorial Day approaches 
and we make plans to see family and 
friends and to attend services and pa-
rades, let us remember that our free-
dom is not free and we owe thanks to 
those who died in sacrifice. 
May God bless them, and may God 
bless the United States of America.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Holy God, abide with us in our walk 
this day. 
When the path isn’t clear, grant us 
the gift of Your discernment. 
When we stumble over our own pride, 
pick us up and strengthen us with hu-
mility. 
Should we be caught in the web of de-
ceit, free us by Your truth. 
When temptation lures us off course, 
hold us accountable to the direction 
You intend for us. 
If along the way we should be injured 
by another in word or deed, fill our 
hearts and minds with forgiveness. 
When we are detoured by demands, 
help us to focus on to Your priorities. 
If we are overcome by anger at those 
who journey with us, may Your kind-
ness temper us that we may in turn be 
kind. 
When words get lost in misunder-
standing, give us the gift of gentleness 
that love would be found in our an-
swers. 
As we face danger, grant us courage. 
In the search for answers, may we 
find faith. 
And for Your many blessings as You 
guide us through this day, may we al-
ways be thankful. 
In Your sovereign name we pray. 
Amen.

ALS AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize 
the 
importance 
of 
ALS 
Awareness Month and continued Fed-
eral support of funding towards a cure 
for ALS. 
ALS a progressive nervous system 
disease that affects nerve cells in the 
brain and spinal cord, causing loss of 
muscle control. 
This devastating disease can affect 
anyone, anywhere, at any age, and, 
still today, is always fatal. 
Veterans are twice as likely to de-
velop ALS, which is why ALS has been 
designated a service-connected disease. 
Not only is there no cure for ALS, 
but there is also no effective treatment 
to halt or reverse the progression of 
the disease. 
Patients typically live 2 to 5 years 
after diagnosis. 
President Biden announced an initia-
tive to leverage a $50 billion invest-
ment over the course of his presidency 
through a new HHS program, called 
ARPA-Health. 
This investment would bring focus, 
scale, and innovation to combat dev-
astating 
diseases 
like 
ALS, 
Alz-
heimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. 
Madam Speaker, the need is urgent, 
and I would encourage my colleagues 
to join me in supporting these invest-
ments. Our response must meet the 
moment. 
f 
RECOGNIZING SERGEANT DAN 
McBRIDE 
(Ms. HERRELL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, in 
1942, Dan McBride enlisted as a para-
trooper in the U.S. Army. Sergeant 
Dan McBride is an American hero from 
New Mexico. 
Assigned to Fox Company, 502nd 
Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st 
Airborne, Dan’s job was a new mod-
ernization in military tactics. Para-
troopers jumped out of perfectly good 
airplanes to parachute behind enemy 
lines. 
On June 6, 1944, Dan jumped into Nor-
mandy on D-day as part of Operation 
Overlord. There he earned his first Pur-
ple Heart. 
On September 17, 1944, Dan jumped 
into Holland as part of Operation Mar-
ket Garden. There he earned his second 
Purple Heart. 
In December of 1944, Dan and the 
101st Airborne made their way to Bas-
togne, Belgium, where they held off a 
desperate push by the Germans in tem-
peratures well below zero, with no win-
ter clothes. The Battle of the Bulge is 
where Dan earned his third Purple 
Heart. 
His actions did not go overlooked. 
Amongst the multitude of medals he 
was awarded, Dan and his fellow para-
troopers, Dick Kline and James Mar-
tin, were featured in the book ‘‘Three 
of the Last Screaming Eagles.’’ 
That book has now been made into a 
documentary 
film 
called 
‘‘A 
Ren-
dezvous with Destiny,’’ which pre-
mieres on May 29 in Columbus, Ohio, at 
the National Veterans Memorial and 
Museum. 
We owe so much to our World War II 
veterans, of whom we have fewer every 
day. 
I 
am 
so 
proud 
of 
Sergeant 
McBride. I can’t think of a better way 
to honor his legacy than by immor-
talizing his story on film.

REBUILDING WITH THE AMERICAN 
JOBS AND FAMILIES PLAN 
(Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given

Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to

American Rescue Plan has made in all 
of our communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2558 
May 19, 2021 
A week or so back, I traveled to a 
town called Kewanee, Illinois, to visit 
our Head Start classrooms there. 
There was a teacher named Miss 
Candice, who told me that she loves 
her job. But she doesn’t stay for the 
pay, she doesn’t stay for the benefits, 
but for the families. 
Miss Candice has a student in her 
class, and before that student, she had 
that student’s siblings. All of the sib-
lings in that family had passed through 
her classroom. She feels that she has 
helped this family grow up. And she 
has. 
The American Rescue Plan isn’t just 
about the numbers, though. It is about 
the 143,000 children in the district I 
serve who will be helped, the 27 million 
children nationwide. Child poverty cut 
in half. We are rebuilding our commu-
nities all over this great country, and 
we can’t stop now. 
We can keep rebuilding with the 
American 
Jobs 
and 
Families 
Act. 
Today and together, we can make this 
a once-in-a century investment in our 
families, the future of our children, and 
our Nation. 
Let’s make sure teachers like Miss 
Candice can continue helping our fami-
lies. 
f 
VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today with great concern over the 
Biden administration’s foreign policy. 
The world has watched with growing 
concern as Hamas rockets have pum-
meled the Israeli people, forcing Israel 
to take retaliatory steps to protect its 
own citizens. This escalation occurs as 
the Biden administration has pivoted 
away from anything useful in the Mid-
dle East, neglecting Israel, which is 
one of our strongest allies. 
Just recently, we have learned that 
over $15 million in foreign aid from this 
year’s phony Democrat coronavirus 
package went to the Palestinians, who 
take their orders from the terrorist 
group Hamas, which is a proxy state 
for Iran, who wishes the total eradi-
cation of Israel. What message does 
this send to our allies, sending money 
to both sides? 
Similarly, President Biden is looking 
to restart the Obama-Biden Iran nu-
clear deal that President Trump smart-
ly left. That naive accord had broad bi-
partisan opposition, including from 
now-Senate Majority Leader CHUCK 
SCHUMER, and was strongly opposed by 
Israel. It is astounding that President 
Biden would take the word of the Ira-
nian Government, whose leaders call us 
their sworn enemy, and spurn our 
strongest ally in the region, Israel. 
We have got to do better. 
BRINGING AWARENESS TO 
TARDIVE DYSKINESIA 
(Mr. PETERS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise dur-
ing Mental Health Awareness Month to 
bring attention to tardive dyskinesia, 
or TD, a persistent and potentially dis-
abling movement disorder that can be 
a side effect of medications prescribed 
to treat mental illness. 
According to a survey of people diag-
nosed with TD, more than half reported 
that the disorder seriously disrupts 
their sleep and their ability to work. 
People living with TD often face stig-
ma, which can worsen mental health 
symptoms and cause withdrawal from 
society. 
While TD affects over half a million 
people in the United States, it remains 
a relatively unknown condition, often 
unrecognized, and patients suffering 
from the illness may be misdiagnosed. 
Earlier this month, Senator CHRIS 
MURPHY introduced S. 184, recognizing 
the week of May 2 to May 8 as Tardive 
Dyskinesia Awareness Week. 
Improving 
awareness 
and 
under-
standing of TD will help reduce the 
stigma of mental illness and help us 
provide better treatment to this under-
served patient population. 
f 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize May as National Foster Care 
Month and to say thank you to every 
parent, volunteer, and mentor who 
work with our foster children. 
I am a proud member of the Congres-
sional Caucus on Foster Youth and had 
a foster brother growing up, who is 
still part of my family. 
During this month, we renew our 
commitment to ensure that every child 
has a safe and loving family. 
I know firsthand how a supportive 
and loving home can make all the dif-
ference in a young person’s life. 
There are over 460,000 children and 
youth in foster care. These children 
and youth range from infants to 18 
years old, when they age out. 
Foster youth who transition out of 
the foster care system without a per-
manent home are at a higher risk of 
unemployment, poor educational out-
comes, health issues, early parenthood, 
long-term dependency on public assist-
ance, increased rates of incarceration, 
and homelessness. 
Every child deserves a safe, sup-
portive, and permanent family. We 
have the responsibility to continue to 
create policies that will improve the 
outcomes of the overall well-being of 
foster youth and their families. 
SUPPORT FOR LONGSHORE AND 
HARBOR WORKERS 
(Mr. MRVAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight legislation that I re-
cently introduced, the Longshore and 
Harbor Workers COVID–19 Compensa-
tion Act. 
I am extremely proud that this is my 
first piece of legislation and that it 
serves to protect the health, safety, 
and livelihoods of our Nation’s mari-
time workers. 
The current health pandemic has cre-
ated serious challenges for these essen-
tial workers, including unpaid, manda-
tory quarantine requirements resulting 
from COVID–19 contraction or expo-
sure. 
In the First Congressional District of 
Indiana, the Burns Waterway Harbor 
generates more than $15 billion in busi-
ness revenue and supports over 80,000 
workers, including union jobs with the 
International Longshoremen’s Associa-
tion. 
I appreciate the support of my chair-
man on the House Education and Labor 
Committee, BOBBY SCOTT, and I look 
forward to working with all of my col-
leagues to support this invaluable 
workforce and to move this legislation 
forward as soon as possible. 
f 
WORSENING DROUGHT CRISIS IN 
CALIFORNIA 
(Mr. VALADAO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VALADAO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to call attention to the 
worsening drought crisis in California, 
which has become so devastating that 
farmers are abandoning their crops in 
the fields. 
This 
was 
an 
asparagus 
field 
in 
Firebaugh, a small, rural town in my 
district. Recently, the farmer made the 
difficult decision to abandon the crop 
in that field to preserve water for his 
melon crops instead. You can clearly 
see the destruction this drought has 
wreaked on his farmland. 
Promised water will now not be de-
livered. Farmers all over California are 
unable to bring their crops to harvest, 
crops that would have fed families 
across the United States. 
With legislation like my bill, the 
RENEW WIIN Act, those farmers might 
have been able to save their fields rath-
er than be forced to waste and destroy 
half-grown produce our Nation relies 
on California to grow. 
If the House majority continues to 
refuse to take up legislation to address 
the drought, farmers won’t have to 
choose between asparagus or melons, 
because they won’t have the water to 
grow any food at all.

CLOSING 
A 
LOOPHOLE 
THAT 
BLOCKS PHARMACEUTICAL COM-
PETITION 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. 
VEASEY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
today, I urge my colleagues to pass the 
Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity 
Act, which will close a loophole that 
blocks 
pharmaceutical 
competition 
and prevents innovative treatments for 
opioid abuse disorders from coming to 
the market. 
The opioid crisis in this country, as 
you know, is very serious, and the 
COVID–19 pandemic has only exacer-
bated the problem. Because the pan-
demic and all of its underlying issues— 
fear of the virus, increased economic 
hardship, and the challenges of staying 
at home and maintaining a safe dis-
tance—opioid abuse disorders are sky-
rocketing, and the epidemic has taken 
a toll on communities in every corner 
of the country. 
I am proud to co-lead this piece of 
legislation and that our Democratic 
majority pushed ahead with bringing it 
to the floor again for a vote amid last 
week’s partisan attempts to hold this 
legislation hostage, because fighting 
the opioid epidemic cannot wait any 
longer. 
In the past 20 years, we have seen a 
drastic increase in opioid addiction, 
with nearly every State in the Nation 
seeing a spike in overdose deaths. Pass-
ing our Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclu-
sivity Act will help curb the senseless 
loss of life by expanding treatment op-
tions and driving down costs of new 
medicines.

HONORING CAPTAIN MICHAEL 
D’ANGELO GARIGAN 
(Mrs. GREENE of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
extraordinary life of Captain Michael 
D’Angelo Garigan, a dedicated law en-
forcement officer from my district, 
who passed away earlier this year. 
Officer Garigan was born in Gordon 
County to a well-known and highly re-
spected family. A Calhoun resident all 
his life, Captain Garigan invested in 
his community and bettered the lives 
of everyone around him. 
Captain Garigan served the people of 
Gordon County for over three decades 
as a deputy, detective, and coordinator 
for the Gordon County Sheriff’s Office. 
In fact, Captain Garigan was decorated 
over a dozen times for exemplary po-
lice work. 
Outside the office, Captain Garigan 
was an active member of his commu-
nity, serving his church as a deacon, 
broadcasting 
high 
school 
football 
games on the radio, and umpiring base-
ball and football games for local youth 
leagues. 
Captain Garigan’s exemplary con-
tribution to the people of Gordon Coun-
ty should be honored and remembered. 
That is why I have introduced House 
Resolution 301, commending Captain 
Garigan for his devotion to his family, 
community, church, and the Nation. 
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Captain Garigan’s family and the peo-
ple of Gordon County. 
f 
LET’S GET BACK TO WORK 
(Mr. TIMMONS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
TIMMONS. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
there are nearly 8 million job openings 
in the United States right now, yet the 
Federal Government is currently pay-
ing people to stay home instead of 
going to work. 
Last year, the government took steps 
to protect and support the American 
people during a once-in-a-lifetime glob-
al pandemic. It was the right thing to 
do at the time. Now science tells us 
that we can resume life as normal. 
Federal money was able to support 
workers during the peak of the pan-
demic, but now the best recovery plan 
is employment. The answer to our sup-
ply chain issues, rising unemployment 
rate, and inflation is not to continue to 
throw trillions of dollars at this prob-
lem. The real solution is to get people 
back to work. 
We need to follow the lead of States, 
like my home State of South Carolina, 
and discontinue participation in the 
Federal unemployment programs. 
Vaccines are available to anyone who 
chooses to get one. Let’s get back to 
work. 
f 
RISING UNEMPLOYMENT 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, former 
President Ronald Reagan once said, 
‘‘The best social program is a job.’’ 
Job creation and growing our econ-
omy are bipartisan issues that benefit 
all Americans. 
This past year, we saw the impact 
that COVID had on our businesses, 
both large and small. But now, as we 
are reopening the economy, many em-
ployers are unable to find workers to 
keep up with the high demand for 
goods and services. 
A major roadblock to businesses 
being able to hire staff comes from the 
Federal supplemental unemployment 
payments made on top of the unem-
ployment 
already 
received 
by 
the 
States. These payments have caused 
many potential employees to continue 
collecting 
unemployment 
from 
the 
government rather than reentering the 
workforce. 
Thankfully, many Republican Gov-
ernors, including Mississippi’s Gov-
ernor Tate Reeves, have ordered the 
end of the Federal unemployment pay-
ments now that the economy is open. 
As a Congress, we need to follow the 
example 
of 
Mississippi 
and 
other 
States and bring this program to a 
close, as more Americans find it pos-
sible to return to normal life. 
f 
THE EXEMPLARY CAREER OF TOM 
TENBRINK 
(Mr. HUIZENGA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the exemplary 
career of Tom TenBrink and his legacy 
of service, dedication, and success in 
the Jenison community. On behalf of 
west Michigan, it is an honor to ex-
press my appreciation and gratitude 
for his many years of service to the 
students, staff, and families of Jenison 
Public Schools. 
Mr. TenBrink’s distinguished career 
with the Jenison Public Schools is 
coming to an end, as he is retiring 
after 34 successful years, 18 of which 
were spent as superintendent of the 
district. 
As a faithful servant to west Michi-
gan, Mr. TenBrink has spent his tenure 
establishing Jenison Public Schools as 
a destination district. He has fostered a 
family culture, prioritizing the impor-
tance of adopting attitudes of servant 
leadership, while also maintaining a 
commitment to educational excellence. 
His steadfast leadership has led to 
the creation of the Jenison Inter-
national Academy, the development of 
a K–12 Spanish immersion program, 
and the building of the Jenison Center 
for the Arts and a new Kids First early 
childhood center. Furthermore, the dis-
trict has earned countless accolades 
under his leadership. 
Tom, thank you for your leadership, 
dedication, and commitment not only 
to the students, but to the Jenison 
community and all of west Michigan. I 
hope you enjoy retirement knowing 
that Jenison and Georgetown Township 
would not be the place it is today with-
out your leadership. 
f 
GET AMERICA BACK ON TRACK 
(Mr. MANN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to urge Americans who can get 
back to work, get back to work. 
It has been more than a year since 
the pandemic shut down the country. 
Today, nationwide coronavirus cases 
have dramatically decreased, and cases 
in Kansas alone are only 7 percent of 
what they were in January. We are get-
ting back to normal. Businesses are 
ready to reopen and welcome back cus-
tomers. 
Unfortunately, 
President 
Biden’s 
bonus, the new monthly unemployment 
checks being distributed on top of the 
checks unemployed persons already re-
ceive, is paying a premium for poten-
tial workers to remain at home rather 
than finding work. I have heard from

countless small business owners in the 
Big First who cite the Biden bonus as 
the reason why they cannot find work-
ers and completely reopen. 
The data doesn’t lie. There are nearly 
8 million open jobs in America right 
now, a new record. The Biden bonus, at 
a time when employers are searching 
for workers, is unwanted Federal Gov-
ernment interference in the market-
place. 
I recently joined fellow Kansas Re-
publicans in urging the Kansas Gov-
ernor to opt out of enhanced unemploy-
ment benefits. I cosponsored the Help 
Wanted Act, which addresses the severe 
labor shortages caused by the Federal 
unemployment policy. 
It is time to take off the masks, get 
our kids back to school, get our busi-
nesses open, and get people back to 
work so we can get America back on 
track.

LET US RESUME THE PEOPLE’S 
BUSINESS 
(Mr. BURGESS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, the 
pandemic has taken a terrible toll on 
the country. The pandemic has taken a 
terrible toll on Congress. In its current 
state, Congress is not working. We 
have restrictions on the voting process, 
we have widespread proxy voting and 
remote hearings. That has all contrib-
uted to the current state of dysfunc-
tion. But the good news is this can be 
fixed. 
Look, the Doctors Caucus are Mem-
bers of Congress with medical back-
grounds, 
well-versed 
in 
evaluating 
medical risks and benefits for patients, 
proposed courses of action, and we have 
worked vigorously to educate our con-
stituents that the coronavirus vaccines 
are safe and effective, yet we are not 
setting a good example of what hap-
pens when vaccine participation is 
high. 
The Doctors Caucus has sent requests 
to the Office of the Attending Physi-
cian and the Speaker of the House ap-
pealing for updated guidelines con-
sistent with the science and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control. 
There will be a motion on the floor of 
this House later this afternoon, fully 
supported by members of the Doctors 
Caucus. I urge all Members to carefully 
consider that proposal and to vote in 
favor. 
f 
CONDEMNING THE HORRIFIC 
SHOOTINGS IN ATLANTA 
(Ms. LETLOW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. LETLOW. Madam Speaker, as a 
woman of faith, I am called to love my 
neighbor as myself and to bear one an-
other’s burdens. My heart is heavy 
with the burden, pain, and loss experi-
enced by the Asian American and Pa-
cific Islander communities. 
Unfortunately, we have seen a na-
tionwide rise in hateful and harmful 
acts toward Asian Americans and Pa-
cific 
Islanders. 
Targeted 
violence 
against anyone based on who they are 
cannot be tolerated. It is not who we 
are as a people and goes against every-
thing we represent as a nation. 
Today, I had hoped to be able to sup-
port H. Res. 275, condemning the hor-
rific shootings of the eight Asian 
women in Atlanta, to honor the lives of 
the victims, and recognize the basic 
American fundamentals that reject ha-
tred and violence. 
Instead, what would have been a fit-
ting and honorable resolution ended up 
being just another vehicle for deliv-
ering cheap shots against our former 
President. 
I am disappointed that I cannot sup-
port this resolution as written.

GREATER 
HALL 
CHAMBER 
OF 
COMMERCE 
AGRIBUSINESS 
AWARDS 
(Mr. CLYDE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 2021 recipients 
of the Greater Hall Chamber of Com-
merce’s annual agribusiness awards. 
The Greater Hall Chamber of Com-
merce comes together each year to rec-
ognize and celebrate the contribution 
of agriculture in our everyday lives. We 
were blessed to be hosted by the Echols 
family at Jaemor Farms this year. 
The Farmer of the Year award went 
to Mr. Scott Glover of Glo-Crest Dairy 
and Mountain Fresh Creamery. In fact, 
I recently had the privilege to tour Mr. 
Glover’s farm, and it was indeed an im-
pressive operation. 
The Friend of Agriculture award was 
given to the Hall County School Dis-
trict’s Agri-Business Center for their 
agriculture programs and the related 
education they provide to their stu-
dents. 
Cargill, Incorporated, was awarded 
the Outstanding Agribusiness award 
for its generous donations of nearly 
$100,000 in the past number of years. 
Additionally, Mr. Phil Hulsey was in-
ducted into the Hall County Agri-
culture Hall of Fame for his incredible 
lifetime contributions as a dairyman. 
Agriculture is the leading industry in 
Georgia, bringing in about $73 billion 
annually. I thank the Greater Hall 
Chamber of Commerce for allowing me 
the opportunity to join them in hon-
oring agricultural leaders in Hall Coun-
ty, Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate this 
year’s winners on their achievements 
in the agriculture industry.

services 
director, 
Jason 
Phelps, of New Hartford, New York, for 
20 years of outstanding service to the 
people of upstate New York. 
Jason began his service as an intern 
for former Congressman Sherry Boeh-
lert in Washington, D.C., and, after a 
short time working for a nonprofit, be-
came a member of Boehlert’s Utica 
staff, where he dedicated himself to 
veterans’ case work. Jason has worked 
for five different Members of Congress 
in the Mohawk Valley and has served 
countless veterans across the region. 
No matter how complex the case, 
Jason is always ready to jump in to as-
sist 
our 
veterans. 
From 
cutting 
through VA red tape, to making sure a 
veteran and their family receives the 
Purple Heart they earned through their 
service, Jason approaches each case 
with determination and compassion. 
Not only is Jason an amazing vet-
erans’ advocate, he is also a role model 
and an inspiration to the many staff 
and interns he has worked with in all 
these offices throughout the years. 
Jason, thank you for your many 
years of service to our brave veterans 
and for also being the guiding light for 
our staff and our community. We all 
look forward to working with you for 
many more years to come.

REMEMBERING ANDRE THE GIANT 
(Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, last but certainly not 
least, today I rise to honor the life of 
the eighth wonder of the world on what 
would have been his 75th birthday: 
Andre Roussimoff, better known as 
Andre the Giant, who spent his final 
years in the small town of Ellerbe, 
right in the middle of the Ninth Dis-
trict of North Carolina. 
Standing 7 feet 4 inches tall and 
weighing over 500 pounds, Andre was 
known for his time in the World Wide 
Wrestling Federation, where he was a 
fan favorite. During his professional 
career, he headlined WrestleMania and 
also defeated Hulk Hogan to win the 
WWF World Heavyweight Champion-
ship. To nonwrestling fans, he is best 
known for playing the role of Fezzik in 
the 1987 film ‘‘The Princess Bride.’’ 
Despite his great size, those who 
knew him found him to be gentle and 
kind. Andre passed away at the age of 
46 in 1993, and his ashes were scattered 
on his beloved Ellerbe ranch. 
I am proud today to pay tribute to 
the memory of Ellerbe’s most famous 
resident.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and add extraneous material on 
H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug 
Exclusivity Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of H.R. 1629, the 
Fairness in Orphan Drugs Exclusivity 
Act, a bill that will help make some 
prescription drugs more affordable for 
the American people. 
This Democratic Congress is com-
mitted to lowering the costs of pre-
scription drugs so that families are no 
longer forced to choose between paying 
for a lifesaving drug or food and rent. 
This legislation today, H.R. 1629, closes 
the loophole that has blocked patients 
from accessing cheaper generic drugs. 
Last Congress, this legislation passed 
the Energy and Commerce Committee 
and the House by voice vote. Last 
week, it garnered support from a large 
majority in the House but not the two- 
thirds necessary to pass under suspen-
sion of the rules. And so, we are here 
again today to debate and pass H.R. 
1629 that will help us address two na-
tional crises: first, the soaring costs of 
prescription drugs; and second, the on-
going opioid epidemic. 
Madam Speaker, this legislation does 
that by closing a very narrow but real 
loophole in a program known as the or-
phan drug program. This program was 
created through the Orphan Drug Act, 
which has been successful in basically 
doing more research and discovery of 
new therapies to treat and even cure 
rare diseases. The law incentivizes the 
development of these lifesaving thera-
pies by awarding 7 years of market ex-
clusivity to manufacturers who receive 
orphan drug status. 
There are two ways that manufactur-
ers can receive these incentives. The 
first is when manufacturers develop 
drugs approved to treat diseases with 
patient populations of 200,000 or fewer. 
And the second way is if the manufac-
turer believes that the research and de-
velopment costs are not expected to be 
recouped by sales of the underlying 
drug. This is known as the cost recov-
ery pathway. It is rarely used, but un-
fortunately, it has led to manufactur-
ers sometimes inappropriately receiv-
ing additional exclusivity and, there-
fore, delaying lower cost generics from 
coming to the market. 
For 
example, 
under 
certain 
cir-
cumstances, if a manufacturer receives 
orphan drug status for one drug, that 
status and its incentives can be passed 
on to future drugs if those drugs treat 
the same condition and have the same 
active ingredient. The status and in-
centives would be available even if 
those future drugs do not meet the or-
phan drug qualifications. 
What this means, Madam Speaker, is 
that future drugs can benefit from the 
7 years of market monopoly without 
having to demonstrate that the drug 
will treat a population of 200,000 or 
fewer or that they may not be able to 
recoup the costs of producing the drug. 
As a result of this loophole, some 
manufacturers are marketing widely 
used drugs to large populations while 
also blocking generic competition from 
coming to market. 
Now, if I can give an egregious exam-
ple of this, it comes from one of our 
most effective drugs to combat opioid 
use disorder. In 1994, an oral formula-
tion of buprenorphine was granted or-
phan drug status. At the time, it was 
not expected that the drug would be 
prescribed frequently, and as a result, 
it 
was 
unlikely 
the 
manufacturer 
would recoup its development costs. 
More than 20 years later, however, in 
2017, the same manufacturer developed 
a new injectable formulation of the 
same drug with the same active ingre-
dient to treat the same condition. As a 
result, the manufacturer was able to 
prevent cheaper generics from coming 
to market. 
But by 2017, the opioid epidemic 
worsened. Our response to the crisis

May 19, 2021 
evolved, and millions were eventually 
prescribed buprenorphine for treat-
ment, generating billions of dollars in 
sales. 
We know that buprenorphine was not 
an orphan drug as the law envisions. 
Nevertheless, the new injectable drug 
was automatically granted orphan drug 
status and exclusivity based on the 
original oral drug’s orphan drug des-
ignation. This delayed the cheaper ge-
neric treatments for opioid use dis-
order from coming to market, and it 
kept the price of the drug high and lim-
ited access for those in need of treat-
ment. 
While the FDA eventually recognized 
this issue with this particular drug and 
revoked its orphan drug designation, 
its exclusivity delayed generic com-
petition that otherwise would be on the 
market today. 
The bottom line is, Madam Speaker, 
we need every tool available to combat 
the opioid epidemic, including low- 
cost, 
affordable 
medication 
treat-
ments, and loopholes like this have to 
be closed. 
H.R. 1629 would stop this from hap-
pening again in the future. It requires 
drug manufacturers to demonstrate in 
their application to the FDA that each 
drug application considered under the 
Orphan Drug Act cost recovery path-
way would be unable to recoup develop-
ment costs at the time of approval. 
This would include all drugs that seek 
the orphan drug designation under the 
cost recovery pathway, including the 
injectable buprenorphine example I 
just described. The bill would also en-
sure that these rules apply to drugs al-
ready on the market, so no drug manu-
facturers can claim orphan drug status 
without first meeting this require-
ment. 
Now, I want to explain, because I 
know this is complicated, this bill is 
narrowly tailored to fix a narrow but 
very real loophole in the law. We can-
not allow these manufacturers to game 
the system any longer, and that is why 
we have to close this loophole today. 
I thank Congresswoman DEAN, who is 
the sponsor of the bill. The merits of 
this bill are obvious, and I know she is 
going to talk about it more, but that is 
why it has received strong bipartisan 
support. I am confident that it will 
once 
again 
get 
bipartisan 
support 
today, make its way through the Sen-
ate, and the President will sign it. 
I regret that we were not able to pass 
this legislation last week under suspen-
sion, but I believe that we will come 
together today to close this loophole. I 
thank our ranking member of the full 
committee, Mrs. RODGERS, for all of 
her help with this. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Or-
phan Drug Exclusivity Act. 
The Orphan Drug Act was enacted to 
incentivize the development of drugs 
that treat rare diseases. Products des-
ignated as orphan drugs may be enti-
tled to 7 years of market exclusivity, 
meaning a drug produced by another 
manufacturer that contains the same 
active ingredient to treat the same 
condition is barred from entering the 
market during this time. 
However, we have seen in recent 
years that some drug manufacturers, 
in an effort to block competition from 
the market, have tried to take advan-
tage of a loophole in existing law. H.R. 
1629 will close this loophole and pre-
vent potential abuse of this program in 
the future. 
We must preserve incentives to inno-
vate, especially for drugs that treat 
rare diseases, while preventing bad ac-
tors from attempting to exploit those 
incentives to benefit from a national 
crisis, as was done during the opioid 
epidemic. 
This legislation strikes that careful 
balance. This bill garnered both Repub-
lican and Democrat support last Con-
gress. I hope we can continue to work 
together to move H.R. 1629 forward in 
the future on a bipartisan basis. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. DEAN), the sponsor of this bill. 
I commend her for all the work she 
has done on this bill. This has been sev-
eral Congresses now, and we are hoping 
this will be the final one where we get 
this bill passed. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member RODGERS and Chair-
man PALLONE for their leadership on 
this bill. 
I, once again, rise in support of H.R. 
1629, the Fairness in Orphan Drug Ex-
clusivity Act. 
This crucial legislation would close a 
current loophole that is used to block 
competition 
in 
the 
pharmaceutical 
marketplace. 
The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 provided 
incentives for prescription drug manu-
facturers to develop products to treat 
rare diseases. This includes an exclu-
sive 7-year marketing right for thera-
pies that receive an orphan drug des-
ignation. 
For a drug to qualify, it must either 
be a treatment for a disease or condi-
tion that affects fewer than 200,000 peo-
ple in the United States or a drug in-
tended for diseases that there is no rea-
sonable expectation to recoup research 
and development costs. 
It would require all drug manufactur-
ers who obtain orphan drug status to 
prove that they have no reasonable ex-
pectation that they will recover R&D 
costs. 
This legislation works to prevent 
companies from continuing to use or-
phan drug exclusivity status for a 
newly approved drug with an identical 
ingredient to the former version with-
out having to prove the inability to re-
coup costs. 
This exact circumstance, as the 
chairman described, happened when a 
manufacturer of a buprenorphine prod-
uct tweaked an older product that had 
received orphan drug status and subse-
quently was given a renewed orphan 
drug exclusivity. 
Buprenorphine is used as a treatment 
for opioid use disorder to help those re-
covering 
from 
addiction. 
Unfortu-
nately, at the time, the opioid epi-
demic was raging, as it is today, and 
was by no means a rare disease. And 
the drug was by no means a market 
loser. It was a moneymaker. 
Closing this loophole would ensure 
that products do not receive an unfair 
market advantage and will get more af-
fordable drugs to patients. It ensures 
consistency with the spirit and intent 
of the Orphan Drug Act. 
Know that we want to encourage and 
support the development of rare dis-
ease treatments and therapeutics. It is 
critically important. But we cannot 
allow this important incentive to be 
co-opted to allow for unfair market 
competition for drugs that are not a 
commercial loss. 
This bill was supported unanimously 
last Congress and has broad support 
among patient advocates. This bill is 
about ensuring market competition, 
reducing barriers to the development of 
new treatments, and, ultimately, sup-
porting patients. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter from 16 patient advo-
cacy organizations in support of this 
legislation.

Re H.R. 1629—The Fairness in Orphan Drug 
Exclusivity Act. 
Hon. MADELEINE DEAN, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MARC VEASEY, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVES DEAN AND VEASEY: 
Thank you for your leadership on the re-
introduction of H.R. 1629, The Fairness in Or-
phan Drug Exclusivity Act. Our nation is in 
crisis. Each day, 130 Americans die from an 
opioid overdose, and according to recent pro-
visional data from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, between June 2019 
and May 2020, the number of people who died 
of an opioid overdose increased by 38.4%. 
We have a responsibility to ensure that all 
treatment options are made available to 
those living with opioid use disorder {OUD). 
Last year, this important legislation was ap-
proved by the House of Representatives 
unanimously. Unfortunately, the Senate was 
unable to also act on the measure before the 
116th Congress adjourned. The new Congress 
now has an opportunity to pass this legisla-
tion swiftly and improve access to life-sav-
ing medication assisted treatments and pre-
vent more lives from being lost. We, the un-
dersigned organizations, support H.R. 1629 
and urge quick passage of this important bill 
that will help ensure the availability of vital 
treatment options for OUD that can save 
American lives. 
The Orphan Drug Act, enacted in 1983, al-
lows the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) to grant manufacturers Orphan Drug 
Designation (ODD) and Orphan Drug Exclu-
sivity (ODE) to a product developed to treat 
rare diseases and conditions affecting less 
than 200,000 patients. In addition, a manufac-
turer also can qualify for ODD and ODE if 
more than 200,000 patients are affected, but 
there is ‘‘no reasonable expectation’’ of re-
covering development costs. Few know about

this option, and as a result it is exceedingly 
rare with only three uses to date. 
In such cases, if a newly approved product 
has the same active ingredient as a previous 
product that received orphan designation 
and exclusivity because the FDA determined 
the original drug could not recoup its devel-
opment costs, the newly approved product 
does not have to demonstrate the inability 
to recoup its development costs. It does not 
matter how much time has passed, or how 
much money the newly approved drug is pre-
dicted to make. This loophole creates the po-
tential for abuses within the system, and it 
is not consistent with intent of the Orphan 
Drug Act. 
Enacting H.R. 1629 will: fix this loophole in 
a narrow and targeted manner to prevent 
this abuse of the Orphan Drug Act; preserve 
incentives for development of products treat-
ing rare diseases and conditions; and ensure 
new treatment options come to market to 
treat OUD. 
During this public health emergency, we 
need all the tools we can muster to fight this 
crisis. We should not tie one hand behind our 
back as the exploitation of this loophole 
would do. 
More than 2.1 million Americans live with 
OUD, making this disease far from rare. This 
disease is a national public health emer-
gency, and we need to close this loophole to 
ensure that all safe and effective treatments 
are available to fight this disease. Thank 
you again for your leadership on this issue, 
and we look forward to working with you to 
help pass H.R. 1629.

Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the Statement of Ad-
ministration Policy issued by the Of-
fice of Management and Budget on May 
17 of this year in support of this bill. 
STATEMENT OF ADMINISTRATION POLICY 
H.R. 1629—FAIRNESS
IN
ORPHAN
DRUG
EXCLU-
SIVITY
ACT—REP. DEAN, D–PENNSYLVANIA, 
AND TWO COSPONSORS 
The Administration supports House pas-
sage of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan 
Drug Exclusivity Act. Orphan drug status is 
intended to encourage companies to develop 
promising drugs for rare diseases. Current 
law provides market exclusivity for drugs 
that treat any disease or condition which (A) 
affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the 
United States, or (B) affects more than 
200,000 in the United States and for which 
there is no reasonable expectation that the 
cost of developing and making available in 
the United States a drug for such disease or 
condition will be recovered from that drug’s 
sales in the United States. H.R. 1629 affects 
only drugs that qualify under the latter pro-
vision. Current law allows market exclu-
sivity to be extended for a new version of the 
same drug without the drug developer having 
to show a lack of profitability for that new 
version as well. This legislation would close 
that loophole, requiring all drugs that obtain 
seven years of market exclusivity for condi-
tions affecting 200,000 or more people to il-
lustrate that they have no reasonable expec-
tation of recovering R&D costs through U.S. 
sales. 
The Administration applauds these steps 
to ensure Americans have access to high 
quality, affordable treatments. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Chairman PALLONE for his support on 
this bill, and I urge all members to sup-
port its passage. 
Mrs.

TO 
RESPOND TO JANUARY 6TH AP-
PROPRIATIONS ACT, 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 409 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 409 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 3233) to establish the Na-
tional Commission to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6 Attack on the United States Capitol 
Complex, and for other purposes. All points 
of order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The bill shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against provisions in the 
bill are waived. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the bill and on 
any amendment thereto to final passage 
without intervening motion except: (1) one 
hour of debate equally divided and controlled 
by the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Homeland Security or 
their respective designees; and (2) one mo-
tion to recommit. 
SEC. 2. Upon adoption of this resolution it 
shall be in order to consider in the House the 
bill (H.R. 3237) making emergency supple-
mental appropriations for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2021, and for other pur-
poses. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. The bill shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill are waived. The 
previous question shall be considered as or-
dered on the bill and on any amendment 
thereto to final passage without intervening 
motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations or their respective designees; 
and (2) one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), my 
friend, pending which I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. During 
consideration of this resolution, all 
time yielded is for the purpose of de-
bate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Yesterday, the Committee on Rules 
met and reported a rule, House Resolu-
tion 409. The rule provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 3233 to establish a Na-
tional Commission to Investigate the 
January 6 Attack on the United States 
Capitol Complex Act, under a closed 
rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Homeland Security 
or their designees and provides one mo-
tion to recommit. 
The rule also provides for consider-
ation of H.R. 3237, the Emergency Se-
curity Supplemental to Respond to 
January 6 Appropriations Act, 2021, 
under a closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form or their designees, and provides 
for one motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, it has been 133 days 
since an angry mob of insurrectionists 
tried to stop the certification of a free 
and fair election in America. The ques-
tion before us today is this: What are 
we going to do about it? 
Some of my colleagues on the other 
side want to sweep this dark chapter 
under the rug. Just last week, one Re-
publican said the events of January 6 
resembled a ‘‘normal tourist visit.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I was here presiding 
over the House on January 6. People 
died that day. Police officers were 
beaten and bloodied. America’s Cap-
itol, the symbol of our freedom and the

May 19, 2021 
citadel of our democracy, was dese-
crated by a mob that wanted to invali-
date an election. There was nothing 
normal about it. 
It is not normal for a mob to break 
into this complex to try and hang the 
Vice President of the United States 
and harm other elected officials. 
It is not normal for insurrectionists 
to try to stop the certification of an 
American election, one that judge after 
judge after judge said was free and fair. 
And it is not normal for Congress to re-
spond by doing nothing. That is why we 
are considering the underlying legisla-
tion contained in this rule. It will es-
tablish a bipartisan 9/11-style commis-
sion to investigate what happened, a 
commission led not by politicians, but 
by experts. 
Now let me say this plainly: A vote 
for this commission is a vote to make 
sure this never happens again. And I 
want to recognize the incredible work 
of the chairman and ranking member 
of the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity in navigating this truly bipartisan 
deal. It is one that will keep the focus 
where it should be, solely on the events 
of January 6. And I look forward to the 
Commission’s report at the end of the 
year. But the truth is, we cannot wait 
until then to fix what we already know 
needs fixing. 
We need to upgrade the physical safe-
ty of this and other Federal buildings. 
We need to increase security in district 
offices, repay the National Guard for 
their service in the aftermath of the in-
surrection, and provide support to the 
overworked Capitol Police force that 
keep us all safe day after day. 
Madam Speaker, this is how you re-
spond responsibly to what happened 4 
months ago, not with deflection or 
mistruths, but by taking action to pro-
tect not only this complex and those 
who work, serve, and visit here, but to 
also protect our very democracy, and 
making sure we never become a coun-
try that lets any angry mob decide who 
the next President will be. 
Madam Speaker, only the voters can 
do that. We need to put the facts on 
RECORD here, to tell the truth and not 
spread lies. And the truth is that some 
on the other side are afraid to do any-
thing around here because they are 
afraid, afraid of the truth, afraid be-
cause their leadership doesn’t want to 
offend the ex-President and his big lie. 
That is all I could think of when I read 
the minority leader’s deeply troubling 
statement opposing the January 6 com-
mission. 
Now, even though it is bipartisan, 
even though his own ranking member 
negotiated the deal, even though we 
gave him virtually everything he asked 
for during the negotiations, a Repub-
lican aide said it best when they were 
quoted in the press yesterday saying 
this: ‘‘I think Kevin was hoping that 
the Democrats would never agree to 
our requests; That way the commission 
would be partisan and we can all vote 
‘‘no’’ and say it is a sham operation, 
because he knows Trump is going to 
lose his mind.’’ Lose his mind over a bi-
partisan commission. 
Madam Speaker, this moment is a 
choice, a choice between the truth or 
siding with the originator of the big 
lie. To my friends on the other side, I 
am asking you to lead with the courage 
of your convictions. Vote your con-
science. Support this bipartisan com-
mission, not just because it is the right 
thing to do, but support it out of re-
spect, out of respect for your col-
leagues, for your staff and the support 
staff here, for the Capitol Police, but, 
most importantly, respect for this in-
stitution. 
Now, I have cast some tough votes in 
my career, but casting a vote to estab-
lish a bipartisan commission to estab-
lish an insurrection is not one of them. 
I appeal to my colleagues to do the 
right thing, to lead with courage, and 
support this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, the distinguished gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, Chairman 
MCGOVERN, for yielding me the cus-
tomary 30 minutes, and I yield myself 
such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule covers 
two items. The first item I will discuss 
is H.R. 3237, a supplemental appropria-
tions bill intended to provide security 
funding for the Capitol complex, in-
cluding funding for the U.S. Capitol 
Police, the National Guard, and other 
agencies that responded to the January 
6 attack on the Capitol complex, as 
well as to provide funds to address the 
coronavirus throughout a variety of 
agencies Congress directly controls. 
Although the process leading to this 
bill started out with bipartisan nego-
tiations, unfortunately, no deal was 
reached. Instead of negotiating with 
Republicans on our counterproposal, as 
is typical in these discussions, Demo-
crats walked away, once again, choos-
ing to go it alone with the bipartisan 
bill before us today. 
Madam Speaker, it is truly dis-
appointing that Democrats were un-
willing to continue to work towards an 
agreement with Republicans on a mat-
ter of this magnitude, and given that 
the Senate is in no hurry to take up 
this legislation, a few additional weeks 
of discussion could and likely would 
have led to a bipartisan product in-
stead of a product destined for the leg-
islative graveyard. 
In the wake of the January 6 attack, 
I would hope that the majority would 
join with Republicans and choose to 
speak with one voice. Instead, like so 
many items in this Congress, the ma-
jority has insisted on its way or the 
highway. And today, they are doing it 
so again with this partisan bill. 
House Republicans and even some 
Senate Democrats have concerns with 
this package. The bill creates a rapid 
response force with the D.C. National 
Guard. Any rapid response force in-
tended to provide backup for the 
United States Capitol Police and to 
protect the Capitol complex should be 
under the control of, and housed within 
Congress. 
As a number of my colleagues men-
tioned during the debate in the Com-
mittee on Rules yesterday, housing 
these capabilities within the D.C. Na-
tional Guard introduces the exact same 
concerns my friends on the other side 
raised in the aftermath of January 6, 
that Congress would be reliant on the 
executive branch to deploy this rapid 
response force. 
Madam Speaker, I have deep con-
cerns about putting this rapid response 
force under the control of any other en-
tity, whether that is the government 
or the District of Columbia or the exec-
utive branch. I also have grave con-
cerns about assigning this role to the 
military since this is undoubtedly a 
law enforcement function. 
Further bipartisan and bicameral ne-
gotiations would have helped us to tai-
lor the package to allay some of the se-
rious concerns Members have, and at 
the same time would direct funds to 
where they are needed most. 
Madam Speaker, I do know that what 
the House passes this week will not be 
the final word. And I am hopeful that 
in 
the 
not-too-distant 
future, 
the 
House will take up a different version 
of this package, one that has been ne-
gotiated with Republicans and that can 
pass the Senate, and I look forward to 
supporting that package before the 
President signs it into law. 
Madam Speaker, our second item for 
today is H.R. 3233, a bill which estab-
lishes a national commission to inves-
tigate the January 6 attack on the 
United States Capitol complex. 
I 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
JOHN 
KATKO and Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON 
of the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity for their hard work in putting this 
legislation together. They took an un-
workable and hyper-partisan proposal 
from the Speaker and turned it into a 
far better bill. I commend these two 
gentlemen for their desire to find bi-
partisan agreement. 
However, I continue to have concerns 
with the legislation, concerns that 
could have been addressed if several of 
the amendments proposed at our Com-
mittee on Rules hearing would have 
been made in order. 
b 1300 
On an issue this serious, the full 
House deserves the opportunity to de-
bate and discuss areas of disagreement 
to see if we can find common ground. 
One of these areas of continued dis-
agreement is that of scope, which re-
mains too narrow in the proposal. 
As the culture of our national poli-
tics has coarsened over the past several 
years, there has been a resulting broad-
er wave of political violence in this 
country. This includes events like the 
2017 domestic terror attack that tar-
geted Republican Members of Congress 
at a baseball practice, and which would 
have been catastrophically worse but 
for the bravery of the U.S. Capitol Po-
lice officers who were present that day.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2565 
May 19, 2021 
It includes the April 2 attack that 
killed U.S. Capitol Police Officer Billy 
Evans. 
It includes the wave of violence, riot-
ing, and property destruction that 
swept across the country last summer. 
The commission should have specific 
flexibility to examine these events in 
their appropriate context. 
I am also concerned about current 
language in the bill related to the on-
going work of law enforcement to bring 
the perpetrators of January 6 to jus-
tice. There are multiple investigations 
already underway. Several committees 
in both the House and the Senate have 
held, and will continue to hold, hear-
ings on the topic. 
The Architect of the Capitol is re-
viewing security vulnerabilities in the 
Capitol complex. As of yesterday, more 
than 450 people have been arrested in 
connection with the events of January 
6, with at least 100 more arrests to 
come. All of these individuals will be 
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the 
law, as well they should. 
Given each of these ongoing inves-
tigations and proceedings, I fear that 
adding yet another investigation from 
this proposed commission would only 
muddy the waters and make achieving 
due process and reaching justice all 
that much harder. 
For that reason, I supported an 
amendment offered in the Rules Com-
mittee that would ensure that the on-
going and critically important work of 
law 
enforcement 
would 
continue 
unimpeded by this commission. For 
reasons I do not fully understand, this 
amendment was blocked. 
Moreover, in my personal opinion, 
the commission would benefit from any 
revelations emerging from the inves-
tigations currently underway. 
In addition, I note that it was 14 
months between the events of 9/11 and 
the creation of the 9/11 commission. 
During that time, many facts emerged 
that informed the investigation of the 
commission. The same could be true 
here. As such, it makes sense to take 
more time prior to commencing an un-
dertaking like this commission. 
Though I have reservations about the 
bill, I have no reservations at all about 
the job Ranking Member KATKO and 
Chairman THOMPSON have done. I am 
hopeful that this bill will be improved 
further as it proceeds through the leg-
islative process. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I also agree with the gentleman that 
Chairman 
THOMPSON
and 
Ranking 
Member KATKO deserve an enormous 
amount of credit. They negotiated a 
truly bipartisan deal. 
I have taken note of the letter that 
Minority Leader MCCARTHY
sent to 
Speaker PELOSI of all the things he 
wanted in this deal, and he got vir-
tually every one of them, all in this bi-
partisan deal. Now, all of a sudden, it is 
not good enough. 
All of the concerns that my good 
friend raised are addressed in this bill. 
The commission could look at any-
thing and investigate anything related 
to the violence that occurred here on 
January 6. 
I mean, what happened here, isn’t 
that a big enough deal to merit an in-
vestigation? 
I don’t get it. 
In the bill, by the way, is language 
that is quite clear about how this com-
mission will not interfere with any 
other ongoing investigations. In fact, 
very similar to the 9/11 commission, it 
will be informed by other investiga-
tions and complement other investiga-
tions. 
So, again, I urge my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans, to vote for 
this commission, out of respect for the 
people who work here, out of respect 
for this institution, out of respect for 
our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from the District of 
Columbia (Ms. NORTON). 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, as 
the Congresswoman from the District 
of Columbia, where the January 6 in-
surrection occurred, I was one of the 
first Members of Congress to call for 
and introduce legislation to create a 9/ 
11-style commission to investigate the 
attack and to ensure that it never hap-
pens again. I strongly support the com-
mission bill. 
The supplemental security appropria-
tions bill provides $66.7 million to 
eliminate the long-running deficit in 
the Federally-funded D.C. Emergency 
Planning and Security Fund. That fund 
pays for the unique public safety and 
security costs D.C. incurs as the Na-
tion’s capital, and is designed to cover 
the District’s costs up front, so that 
D.C. does not have to expend local 
funds for Federal purposes and seek an 
appropriation to be reimbursed after 
the fact. 
Over the last several years, our Re-
publican colleagues have opposed fully 
funding the D.C. Fund. The January 6 
insurrection 
shows 
Congress 
must 
never shortchange security in the Na-
tion’s Capitol again. 
I also appreciate that the appropria-
tions bill would mirror two of my bills. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia. 
Ms. NORTON. I also appreciate that 
the appropriations bill would mirror 
two of my bills, prohibiting the use of 
funds in the bill to install permanent 
aboveground fencing at the Capitol 
complex, and requiring Capitol Police 
officers to wear body cameras. 
In February, I introduced legislation 
to prohibit funds for permanent fencing 
at the Capitol complex, and in March 
the House passed my bill to require 
Federal police officers to wear body 
cameras as part of the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act of 2021. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, I will offer an amend-
ment to the rule to bring up House 
Resolution 
153, 
a 
resolution 
con-
demning the recent hate crimes com-
mitted against Asian Americans and 
Pacific Islanders. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of my 
amendment in the RECORD, along with 
extraneous 
material, 
immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 4 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Mrs. STEEL), my good friend, 
the author of the resolution, to further 
explain the amendment. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the previous question. 
If the previous question is defeated, 
Republicans will amend this rule to im-
mediately consider House Resolution 
153, the condemning recent hate crimes 
committed against Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders. 
This bipartisan bill was the very first 
bill I introduced in Congress. 
I am here today to condemn the re-
cent discrimination and violence the 
AAPI community has experienced. I 
spoke on this issue yesterday, and I am 
proud to be standing here again today. 
I was born in Korea and raised in 
Japan. I am living my American Dream 
and I am a proud American. I am hon-
ored every day to represent my com-
munity in Congress. Unfortunately, 
hate crime against the Asian-American 
community is not new. And as an 
American who loves this country dear-
ly, this issue is very personal to me. 
Hate 
crimes 
committed 
against 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders 
have been on the rise since the start of 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Between 
March and December of last year, near-
ly 3,000 firsthand accounts of Asian- 
American and Pacific Islander hate 
crimes were recorded in the United 
States. The reporting has now been up-
dated by the group Stop AAPI Hate, 
and between March 2020 and March 
2021, more than 6,000 hate crimes or 
hate incidents were reported. This in-
cludes physical assault, verbal assault, 
and online bullying of Asian Ameri-
cans. 
My home State of California makes 
up more than 40 percent of these inci-
dents and crimes. It is heartbreaking 
to read the news stories of these 
crimes, and my heart goes out to all 
those who have been victims of this vi-
olence. That is why the first bill I in-
troduced in Congress in February was 
H. Res. 153. It is the only bipartisan 
legislation in the House of its kind, and 
I am proud that it has been cospon-
sored by several of my Democratic col-
leagues, 
including 
Congressmembers

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2566 
May 19, 2021 
KATIE
PORTER, LOU
CORREA, ALAN 
LOWENTHAL, and MIKE LEVIN. 
This resolution is very simple. It con-
demns all expressions of anti-Asian and 
Pacific Islander intolerance, and calls 
on Federal, State, and local officials to 
work together to investigate and im-
prove reporting of these crimes. 
Yesterday, I spoke about how I was 
disappointed that this truly bipartisan 
resolution was not a part of this fixed 
conversation, and was not being con-
sidered on the floor. But, today, we 
have another opportunity to show soli-
darity with our AAPI community and 
vote on my bipartisan resolution. 
Discrimination and hate against any 
community are against the funda-
mental values of American cultural. 
Discrimination and hate have no place 
in this great country. Madam Speaker, 
I am proud that my resolution has sup-
port from both sides of the aisle, unlike 
the other bills on the floor today. I 
hope we can work together to put an 
end to this hate. I am asking my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question so that I can bring my bipar-
tisan bill condemning hate crimes 
against AAPI on the floor. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reference the text of S. 937 and H. Res. 
275, a bill and a resolution we are con-
sidering this week. S. 937 was passed 
yesterday, and right after this debate, 
we are going to adopt H. Res. 275. They 
are two pieces of legislation con-
demning hate crimes against Asian 
Americans in this country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Ms. 
SHERRILL). 
Ms. SHERRILL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
3233, which creates a bipartisan inde-
pendent commission to investigate the 
attacks on the Capitol on January 6. 
Why do we need this commission? 
We need this commission because the 
American people must understand ex-
actly what happened so we can all 
forge a more resilient democracy. 
We need this commission because, on 
January 6, I was lying on the floor to 
avoid possible shooters in this very 
Chamber, holding a gas mask in one 
hand and a phone in the other as I 
called my husband in case I didn’t 
make it home. 
We need this commission because, de-
spite our own experiences, despite 
video footage, despite testimony by po-
lice, it has been suggested that this 
was simply a normal tourist event. 
Well, we have a lot of tourism where I 
am from. People visit our beautiful 
shore and historic sights, and no tour-
ist event I have ever seen looks like 
that day. 
As The New York Times reported: 
The pure savagery of the mob was 
breathtaking, as cataloged by injuries 
inflicted. One police officer lost an eye; 
another, the tip of his finger. Still an-
other was shocked so many times with 
a taser gun that he had a heart attack. 
Madam Speaker, we need this com-
mission. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
b 1315 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. GALLEGO). 
Mr. 
GALLEGO. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when I joined the Marine Corps, the 
most sacred part of my oath was to de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic. I took that oath again when 
I was sworn into office as a Member of 
Congress. I never thought I would have 
to defend this oath against domestic 
enemies on the floor of Congress—but 
on January 6, I did. 
Democracy is fragile. We have seen it 
across the world: When leaders cower 
in the face of an attack on democracy, 
it can be lost. Let’s be clear: Democ-
racy itself was violently attacked on 
January 6. If we don’t stand up for it, 
it will happen again. If we don’t tell 
the truth about what happened on Jan-
uary 6, it will happen again. If we don’t 
have swift and harsh accountability for 
everyone involved in January 6, it will 
happen again. 
If all of us don’t stand up to traitors 
and cowards in defense of our Constitu-
tion, January 6 will happen again. That 
is why all of us have an obligation 
today to defend our democracy and 
support the creation of a national com-
mission to investigate the January 6 
attack, because it can never be allowed 
to happen again. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD
a statement 
from the family of United States Cap-
itol Officer Howie Liebengood, who 
died by suicide. His death was a direct 
result of the trauma and strain from 
the January 6 attack. 
Madam Speaker, in the statement, 
the 
family 
of 
Officer 
Liebengood 
states: ‘‘We believe a thorough, non-
partisan investigation into the root 
causes of and the response to the Janu-
ary 6 riot is essential for our Nation to 
move forward. Howie’s death was an 
immediate outgrowth of those events.’’

BOTH PIECES OF LEGISLATION 
WASHINGTON, DC—Today, the Office of Con-
gresswoman Jennifer Wexton (D–VA) re-
leased the following statement from the fam-
ily of United States Capitol Police Officer 
Howie Liebengood regarding the National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Complex 
Act and the Emergency Security Supple-
mental to Respond to January 6th Appro-
priations Act. 
‘‘We believe a thorough, non-partisan in-
vestigation into the root causes of and the 
response to the January 6th riot is essential 
for our nation to move forward. Howie’s 
death was an immediate outgrowth of those 
events. Every officer who worked that day, 
as well as their families, should have a bet-
ter understanding of what happened. Uncov-
ering the facts will help our nation heal and 
may lessen the lingering emotional bitter-
ness that has divided our country. We im-
plore Congress to work as one and establish 
the proposed Commission. 
‘‘Additionally, improved mental health for 
USCP officers has been one of our goals for 
the past four months. Through the tireless 
efforts of Congresswoman Wexton, we are 
honored a wellness program bearing Howie’s 
name has been proposed in the security sup-
plemental along with more resources for the 
program. We welcome and support the new 
funding and staffing initiatives that will 
help prevent future tragedies among the 
USCP.’’ 
Howie C. Liebengood grew up and lived in 
Vienna, Virginia and was Congresswoman 
Wexton’s constituent. He was raised in the 
Capitol Hill community, where his father, 
Howard S. Liebengood, served for decades as 
a Hill staffer and later the Senate Sergeant 
at Arms. Howie received a Bachelor’s Degree 
at Purdue University, a Master ’s Degree at 
the University of Memphis, and started a ca-
reer as a race car driver in the 1990s. Howie 
joined the Capitol Police in 2005 and served 
as an officer for 15 years He was assigned to 
the Senate division and often worked at the 
Delaware entrance of the Russell Senate Of-
fice Building. Howie took his life on January 
9, and his death was a direct result of the 
trauma and strain from the January 6th at-
tack on the Capitol and the around-the-clock 
shifts in the subsequent days. He is survived 
by his wife, Dr. Serena McClam Liebengood, 
his siblings, John Liebengood and Anne Win-
ters, and many family and friends who loved 
him dearly. 
Following Howie’s death, Dr. Liebengood 
and Howie’s family have been advocating 
[iqconnect.house.gov] to have Howie’s death 
designated ‘‘in the line of duty;’’ to support 
much needed USCP reforms; and to promote 
positive change around mental health issues 
for his fellow law enforcement officers, both 
with the Capitol Police and with law enforce-
ment agencies generally. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, there is 
hardly anything this Congress can do 
that will be more important than hav-
ing a bipartisan commission to look at 
the insurrection that occurred in this 
Capitol on January 6. There was an at-
tempt to overturn our Constitution 
and to displace the electoral college 
and the peaceful transition of power 
that makes our country unique and 
special among the countries of the 
world. 
This wouldn’t have happened but for 
the President at the time telling peo-
ple to come to Washington on January 
6—no other date but the day of the 
electoral college—to fight like hell or 
you won’t have a government anymore 
and telling them he would walk with 
them to the Capitol and told them 
where to go. 
This cannot happen again. If we don’t 
have this commission and reveal the 
truth, it will happen again. There is 
only one reason you wouldn’t vote for 
this, Madam Speaker: if you can’t han-
dle the truth. Get the truth out. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a May 19 letter

from the Bipartisan Policy Center in 
support of H.R. 3233, the National Com-
mission to Investigate the January 6 
Attack on the United States Capitol 
Complex Act. 
In the letter, the cochairs of the 9/11 
Commission, Governor Tom Kean and 
Representative Lee Hamilton state: ‘‘A 
full accounting of the events of Janu-
ary 6 and the identification of meas-
ures to strengthen the Congress can 
help our country heal.’’ 
[From BPC Action] 
BPC ACTION URGES SUPPORT FOR H.R. 3233 
H.R. 3233, the ‘‘National Commission to In-
vestigate the January 6 Attack on the 
United States Capitol Complex Act,’’ is a 
crucial step for the country to get the truth 
of those shocking events and agree on how to 
ensure they never occur again. The Bipar-
tisan Policy Center is encouraged that the 
agreement reflects the principles of 9–11 
Commission chairs Gov. Tom Kean and Rep. 
Lee Hamilton, who stated, ‘‘A full account-
ing of the events of January 6th and the 
identification of measures to strengthen the 
Congress can help our country heal.’’ 
A single narrative of the facts of that day 
and actionable recommendations for pre-
venting them from recurring are the predi-
cate for ensuring our democracy is respected 
and protected. This bipartisan, independent 
commission is structured so experts will be 
empowered to objectively assess the evidence 
and chart a path forward. 
In this midst of opportunity for growth and 
healing, it is crucial that we reflect on our 
history: the strength of the 9/11 commission 
was that it was bipartisan and unified by the 
imperative of national security. Twenty 
years later, we are reminded of the security 
challenges this nation faces, and we must 
come together in the same way we did fol-
lowing 9/11. 
We applaud the House and Senate commit-
tees and law enforcement investigations that 
have laid groundwork for an independent 
commission to begin its work—and House 
and Senate leaders, especially Chairman 
BENNIE
THOMPSON
and Ranking Member 
JOHN KATKO, for creating a process that has 
a real chance for success. We urge Congress 
to support H.R. 3233. 
[From Issue One] 
JOINT STATEMENT FROM GOVERNOR TOM KEAN 
AND CONGRESSMAN LEE HAMILTON, CHAIR-
MAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE 9/11 COM-
MISSION 
‘‘We very strongly urge House Members to 
support H.R. 3233, the bipartisan National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Complex. 
That bill would create a 9/11 style commis-
sion to investigate the January 6th assault 
on the U.S. Capitol. That was a dark day in 
American history, one of the darkest. 
‘‘As Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/ 
11 Commission, unity of purpose was key to 
the effectiveness of the group. We put coun-
try above party, without bias, the events be-
fore, during and after the attack. We sought 
to understand our vulnerabilities in order to 
prevent future attacks or future acts of ter-
rorism. 
‘‘Today, democracy faces a new threat. The 
January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was one 
of the darkest days in the history of our 
country. Americans deserve an objective and 
an accurate account of what happened. As we 
did in the wake of September 11, it’s time to 
set aside partisan politics and come together 
as Americans in common pursuit of truth 
and justice.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON), who is the 
distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Homeland Security. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. 
Res. 409, which allows for the debate on 
H.R. 3233, the National Commission to 
Investigate the January 6 Attack on 
the United States Capitol Complex Act. 
After months of negotiations, last 
week I was pleased to introduce this 
measure with the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO). 
Back in 2007, I was proud to be the 
lead sponsor of legislation to imple-
ment the unfulfilled recommendations 
of the 9/11 Commission. I can say with 
certainty, at that time, I could never 
have imagined that I would be standing 
here today, almost 15 years later, advo-
cating for the establishment of a 9/11- 
style commission to investigate a vio-
lent domestic attack on the United 
States Capitol. 
On January 6, the world watched 
Americans storm the Capitol and en-
gage in violence to try to intimidate 
and prevent Congress from carrying 
out its constitutional duty to certify a 
Presidential election, a solemn process 
central to the peaceful transfer of 
power in our democracy. 
Like the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the 
events of January 6 have cast a long 
shadow on our country. Like the 9/11 
terrorist attacks, it has raised funda-
mental questions about information- 
sharing, 
coordination, 
preparedness, 
and response at all levels of govern-
ment. 
When the defenses around the citadel 
of our democracy fail as profoundly as 
they did on January 6, then attention 
must be paid. At least one Capitol Po-
lice Officer died because of the cause of 
the violence that day. Others died too, 
and injuries were extensive also—not 
the least of which is the body blow of 
Americans’ confidence that the reforms 
undertaken after 9/11 would deliver bet-
ter information-sharing and coordina-
tion to keep us secure. 
H.R. 3233 authorizes the establish-
ment of a 10-member commission that 
mirrors the 9/11 Commission, the gold 
standard for bipartisan commissions. 
The January 6 Commission would be 
required to investigate and report on 
all the facts and causes of the attack 
including relevant influencing factors 
that may have contributed to the at-
tack. 
Given how politically charged the 
events of January 6 have become, we 
need to come together in a patriotic, 
bipartisan way and approve this inde-
pendent body, just as we did when we 
approved the creation of the 9/11 Com-
mission. The 9/11 Commission acted not 
out of partisanship, but out of patriot-
ism. We need that same sense of duty 
today. Apathy is not a security strat-
egy, and neither are ignorance or will-
ful disregard. 
After such a shocking attack, noth-
ing short of a full accounting of what 
took place will put us on the path to 
improving our homeland security. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my 
good friend, the distinguished chair-
man of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, for his excellent work on this 
bill; and I want to thank his ranking 
member and negotiating partner. I 
think they, frankly, moved us in the 
right direction toward agreement. 
We continue to have concerns. It is a 
long, legislative process. Obviously, we 
will have to pass something through 
the Senate as well. So it is my hope we 
can build upon their work and continue 
to move forward. 
We are not prepared at this time to 
provide huge support for this bill. We 
think it can continue to improve. But 
that doesn’t take anything away from 
my appreciation and admiration for 
the gentleman from Mississippi for his 
good work. We will continue to try and 
work with him and others and get to a 
place we can all come to agree. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
let’s be clear that opposition to this 
commission is not about substance or 
policy; it really is about politics, plain 
and simple. At least, my Republican 
colleagues in the Senate side are will-
ing to admit that. Senator THUNE said 
that there is concern among Repub-
licans that the findings could be 
‘‘weaponized politically and drug into 
next year’’. 
I get that his members want to ‘‘be 
moving forward and not looking back-
ward,’’ but this was an attack on the 
United States Capitol, and all the peo-
ple who work here. It was an attack on 
our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a CNN article entitled ‘‘Repub-
licans fear January 6 probe could un-
dercut 2022 midterm message.’’ 
[From CNN, May 19, 2021] 
REPUBLICANS FEAR JANUARY 6 PROBE COULD 
UNDERCUT 2022 MIDTERM MESSAGE 
(By Manu Raju) 
Senior Republicans are making clear they 
have little interest in moving forward with a 
sweeping January 6 investigation in part be-
cause a detailed probe could become politi-
cally damaging and amount to a distraction 
for their party just as control of Congress is 
at stake in next year’s midterm elections. 
Publicly and privately, Republicans are 
making that case, with Senate GOP Whip 
John Thune noting that there’s concern 
among some GOP members that the findings 
of the probe ‘‘could be weaponized politically 
and drug into next year.’’ ‘‘I want our mid-
term message to be on the kinds of things 
that the American people are dealing with: 
That’s jobs and wages and the economy and 
national security, safe streets and strong 
borders—not relitigating the 2020 elections,’’ 
Thune told CNN. ‘‘A lot of our members, and 
I think this is true of a lot of House Repub-
licans, want to be moving forward and not 
looking backward. Anything that gets us re-
hashing the 2020 elections I think is a day 
lost on being able to draw a contrast be-
tween us the Democrats’ very radical left- 
wing agenda.’’ 
Thune’s comments came moments after 
Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell an-
nounced his opposition on the floor, con-
tending it would duplicate ongoing probes

and contending the deal—which was reached 
between a House Republican and House Dem-
ocrat—is designed to find a conclusion that 
would be in ‘‘Democrats’ hands.’’ The com-
mission would be structured so 10 members— 
chosen equally between the leaders from 
both political parties—could report by year’s 
end on what happened on January 6, as well 
as the ‘‘influencing factors’’ behind it. 
It’s clear that such an investigation would 
also look at then-President Donald Trump’s 
role in promoting the January 6 ‘‘Stop the 
Steal’’ rally, his lies that the election was 
stolen and his efforts to subvert the will of 
voters. Moreover, it could put an uncomfort-
able focus on some conservative GOP sen-
ators and House members who sought to 
overturn the election results in Congress, 
while keeping the issue front-and-center as 
the investigation plays out over the next 
year. 
And there are ample questions about 
whether House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy 
would be forced to testify to explain what 
Trump was saying on January 6 given the 
two spoke during a heated phone call that 
day. 
‘‘It would be a distraction,’’ one senior 
GOP source told CNN, arguing any investiga-
tion should also look at left-wing extremism 
as well. 
Similar concerns were voiced through the 
Senate Republican Conference on Wednes-
day, coming hours after a group of members 
huddled privately with McCarthy earlier in 
the morning. 
Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and 
member of leadership, said that in addition 
to his concern about a commission’s work 
overlapping with criminal probes, he accused 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of pushing the 
investigation to help Democrats’ chances at 
keeping control of Congress. 
‘‘Well, part of the concern is that’s the 
plan,’’ Cornyn said. ‘‘That’s Pelosi’s plan.’’ If 
the probe dragged out until the next year, he 
added: ‘‘That would be the Democrats’ 
dream. . . . I generally don’t try to help 
Democrats.’’ 
While the bill is expected to pass the House 
on Wednesday, it’s an open question whether 
it will pass the Senate, where 60 votes would 
be needed to break a GOP filibuster. 
Thune, the chief GOP vote counter, said 
they haven’t taken the caucus’ temperature 
yet on the plan. 
‘‘I would say that there’s a skepticism 
about what’s happening in the House right 
now and whether or not what comes out is a 
proposal that will be fair.’’ 
Sen. Gary Peters, who chairs the Demo-
cratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said 
there’s a reason why Republicans are bat-
tling the commission. 
‘‘They’re afraid of the truth because it 
puts them on the wrong side of what is 
right,’’ Peters, a Michigan Democrat, said 
Wednesday. 
Asked if he is concerned the probe could 
last into the midterm season when the GOP 
wants to focus on jobs, Republican Sen. 
Thom Tillis of North Carolina said: ‘‘There’s 
a lot of stuff we need to focus on.’’ 
‘‘Why shift our attention away from that, 
when we already have an infrastructure in 
place to address a lot of the things that the 
commission seems to be stood up to ad-
dress,’’ Tillis asked. ‘‘Seems redundant.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL). 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of truth and jus-
tice. The chairman and the ranking 
member are two honorable men. We all 
can see this, Madam Speaker, and I am 
happy about that. 
That attack was born of lies. This 
year marks the 20th anniversary of the 
worst external terrorist attack in our 
modern history. The gravest attack 
ever on American democracy came 133 
days ago. That attack was born of lies. 
It was born about the voting, about 
elections, and about our democracy. 
These lies divided our country. They 
spread across our land like a plague. 
On December 11, I warned on this 
floor of elected officials across this Na-
tion amplifying big lies. On January 6, 
the world saw the result. Like the 9/11 
Commission it is modeled after, this 
commission must hold allegiance only 
to the truth. A full investigation of 
this attack must reflect on how the 
spark of insurrection was ignited and 
who fanned the flames. It is our sacred 
duty, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ESPAILLAT). 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the rule and the un-
derlying bills. January 6 was an un-
precedented event that exposed the 
real threat to the beating heart of our 
democracy: our Capitol and all of us 
who work in it. 
Shortly after the insurrection, I ex-
pressed the need to form a 9/11-style 
commission, not only to get to the bot-
tom of this and who was responsible for 
it, but also to ensure that it never hap-
pens again. This is exactly what these 
bills do, Madam Speaker. 
The security of our Capitol and our 
democracy is not a partisan issue. 
However, the other side of the aisle has 
attempted to turn this into a sideshow, 
Madam Speaker, into a circus. I submit 
to you that the attempted murder of 
our Vice President, the attempted mur-
der of our Speaker, and the attempted 
murder of any one of us is not a side-
show, it is not a circus, it is a real 
threat to everyone across this great 
land. 
Taken together, these two critical 
bills will help us finally recover from 
the January 6 insurrection. We must 
ensure that these sacred Halls will 
never again be overrun by racist thugs 
against our democracy. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the rule and the es-
tablishment of a national commission 
to study the events of January 6, 2021. 
The January 6 insurrection was a vio-
lent and bloody attack on our democ-
racy. Domestic terrorists stormed this 
building. They did so in order to stop 
the peaceful transition of power and to 
keep Donald Trump in office, even 
after he lost the 2020 election fair and 
square. 
We have never seen this type of at-
tack before in this country. I pray we 
never will again. That is why we need 
to establish a national commission to 
understand how this happened, to gath-
er all the facts surrounding these 
events, and, most importantly, to en-
sure it never happens again. 
I want to thank Chairman THOMPSON 
and Ranking Member KATKO for work-
ing across the aisle to establish this bi-
partisan commission. The people who 
took part in this insurrection caused 
great damage to this building, dozens 
of people were injured, and five people 
lost their lives. But despite the horror 
of that day, our democracy endured. 
This commission will allow us to un-
derstand how this happened and how 
we prevent it and gather all the facts. 
The search for truth matters. Pro-
tecting our democracy matters. This 
should be a bipartisan vote to strongly 
support the work of this commission. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am having trouble trying to figure out 
exactly what the problem that some of 
my Republican colleagues may have 
with this bill. Maybe, based on the lack 
of speakers, they are having trouble 
figuring it out too. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania 
(Ms. SCANLON), who is a distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the rule and 
underlying bills before us today. 
It has been over 4 months since the 
attack on the Capitol, an attack which 
disrupted a joint session of Congress 
and threatened one of the most essen-
tial pillars of our American Govern-
ment: the peaceful and democratic 
transfer of power. That lawless assault 
threatened not just the foundations of 
our government, but also the lives of 
those who served their fellow citizens 
here. That assault shattered the illu-
sion of security and sanctity of this 
building, the United States Capitol. 
We remain eternally grateful for the 
bravery and patriotism of the members 
of the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropoli-
tan Police who heroically defended this 
building, its occupants, and our democ-
racy. 
But it is long past time to launch an 
independent, bipartisan examination of 
what occurred on January 6, why it oc-
curred, and how to prevent it from ever 
happening again. We need a commis-
sion with the power and authority to 
collect 
evidence 
and 
make 
rec-
ommendations across multiple agen-
cies, committees, and branches of gov-
ernment impacted by the attack. 
Almost as soon as the tear gas and 
broken glass had been cleared in the 
wee hours of January 7, we began hear-
ing calls for unity. But what has re-
mained illusive is a shared set of facts 
behind which the Nation can unify and 
forge a path to healing and account-
ability for the events of January 6. 
That path starts with these bills. 
We cannot repair the damage to our 
government and the rule of law so long

as we have national leaders or those 
who seek to be propagating lies about 
why our government was attacked and 
the gravity of the events of January 6. 
Those falsehoods are incredibly dan-
gerous, and so long as they remain un-
challenged 
by 
a 
bipartisan, 
inde-
pendent commission, we are never 
going to get past the dark part of our 
history. 
In addition to creating this bipar-
tisan commission, we also need to pass 
the emergency supplemental appro-
priations bill to fund the many addi-
tional expenses which were created by 
the Capitol attack, including overtime, 
staffing, training for law enforcement, 
reimbursing the National Guard, and 
so much more. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
for this rule. 
b 1330 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman very much for 
yielding. 
I was here on 9/11, and I could see the 
billowing smoke as we ran for our lives 
as the planes were hitting the Pen-
tagon and the aftermath. 
I was here on January 6 when 
screaming voices came and glass began 
to break, as the video has shown us, 
the video of the beatings. My tribute to 
all the officers—we have heard the 
story of Officer Fanone. 
All we want is truth, and all we want 
is for the big lie to be undone. 
It is important to support H.R. 3233, 
the National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the 
United States Capitol Complex, and the 
underlying 
emergency 
supplemental 
that General Honore and his com-
mittee so aptly did. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON
and 
Ranking Member KATKO for their hard 
work. Be reminded of the fact that it 
was the former President still lin-
gering, lashing around instead of allow-
ing the transfer of peaceful government 
to go. He is now pushing big lies. 
I wanted the Vice President to live. I 
wanted the Speaker to live. I wanted 
Members to live. I wanted Black offi-
cers not to be under the threat of rac-
ist overtones. So this commission will 
listen to it all. 
I ask my colleagues to get rid of the 
big lie, stand by the Constitution, the 
flag, and justice and equality for all. 
Pass H.R. 3233, the National Commis-
sion to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Com-
plex Act. 
Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Sub-
committee on Crime, Homeland Security, and 
Terrorism, and a senior member of the Home-
land Security, and Budget Committees, I rise 
in strong support of the rule governing debate 
of H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Supple-
mental to Respond to January 6th Appropria-
tions Act of 2021, and H.R. 3233, the National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Complex. 
H.R. 3237 provides $1.9 billion in funding to 
respond to the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol 
on January 6, 2021, when thousands of do-
mestic terrorists inspired by the 45th President 
stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent, crazed, 
and desperate effort to disrupt the Joint Meet-
ing of Congress prescribed by the Constitution 
to tally the votes of presidential electors and 
announce the results to the nation and the 
world. 
H.R. 3233, the National Commission to In-
vestigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol 
Complex Act, which establishes a national 
commission charged with investigating and re-
porting upon the facts and causes of the Janu-
ary 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol as well 
as the influencing factors that may have pro-
voked the attack on our democracy. 
Specifically, the January 6 Commission’s 
mandate includes: 
1. examining and evaluating evidence devel-
oped by relevant Federal, State, and local 
governments, in a manner that is respectful of 
ongoing investigations, regarding the facts and 
circumstances of the attack; 
2. building upon other investigations regard-
ing the attack and targeted violence and do-
mestic terrorism related to such attack; and 
3. reporting to the President and Congress 
regarding its findings, conclusions, and rec-
ommendations for corrective measures taken 
to prevent future acts of targeted violence and 
domestic terrorism and improves the security 
posture of the United States Capitol Complex 
in a manner that preserves the accessibility of 
the Capitol Complex for all Americans, and 
strengthen the security and resilience of nation 
and American democratic institutions against 
domestic terrorism. 
Like September 11, 2001, we cannot and 
must not ever forget the existential threat 
faced by our democracy on January 6, 2021, 
when thousands of domestic terrorists inspired 
by the 45th President stormed the U.S. Capitol 
in a violent, crazed, and desperate effort to 
disrupt the Joint Meeting of Congress pre-
scribed by the Constitution to tally the votes of 
presidential electors and announce the results 
to the nation and the world. 
Mr. Speaker, the morning of September 11, 
2001 is, and will always be, a day like no 
other. 
It is a day all living Americans will remem-
ber because not since Pearl Harbor had there 
been such a dastardly and deadly attack on 
American soil. 
On that day, we were united in our shock 
and anger and sadness and in our resolve to 
defend our country and protect the freedoms 
that has made America the greatest country in 
the history of the world. 
I experienced the same gamut of emotions 
on January 6: grief, hope, resolve, and fierce 
commitment to protect our country. 
Mr. Speaker, the assault on the U.S. Capitol 
by domestic terrorists and insurrectionists 
rightly takes its place as one of the darkest 
moments in our nation’s history since the Civil 
War. 
Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrection 
caused tragic loss of life and injuries, while 
leaving behind widespread physical damage to 
the Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for 
Members, Congressional employees, and the 
Capitol Police. 
It bears repeating often that the Congress 
and the nation owe undying gratitude to the 
men and women who answered the call of 
constitutional duty and heroically won the day 
on that bloody and deadly afternoon. 
That is why I introduced H. Res. 169, a res-
olution commending the officers of the United 
States Capitol Police Department, the Metro-
politan Police Department of Washington, DC, 
and other law enforcement personnel for their 
selfless and heroic service in defense of 
American democracy in responding to the as-
sault on the United States Capitol by domestic 
terrorists on January 6, 2021. 
H. Res. 169 notes that the January 6, 2021 
siege of the Capitol assault resulted in one of 
the worst days of injuries for law enforcement 
in the United States since the September 11, 
2001, terrorist attacks but that the officers of 
the United States Capitol Police Department, 
the Metropolitan Police Department of Wash-
ington, DC, and other uniformed law enforce-
ment officers stood their ground in defense of 
American democracy while being attacked 
metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and 
other weapons. 
The resolution conveys the thanks and ap-
preciation of a grateful nation to them for their 
selfless and heroic service, encourages all 
educational and media institutions throughout 
the United States to teach and celebrate the 
story of their heroism and patriotism; and calls 
upon all Americans to read, celebrate, and re-
vere the Constitution of the United States, fi-
delity to which is the surest best means of 
forming a more perfect union, establishing jus-
tice, ensuring domestic tranquility, providing 
for the common defense, promoting the gen-
eral welfare, and securing the blessing of lib-
erty to them and their posterity. 
Mr. Speaker, the domestic terrorists and 
seditionists who attacked the Capitol Building 
on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their 
ardent defenders and apologists across the 
aisle have stated falsely, on a ‘‘normal tour 
visit’’; nor was their effort to lay siege to the 
Capitol and disrupt the processes of govern-
ment an act of persons who love their country. 
And it is absurd to suggest that it was a 
celebration of the United States and what it 
stands for when the leading edge of terrorists 
desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading 
the treasonous Confederate flag through the 
building and when, because of their insurrec-
tion, several members of law enforcement 
made the supreme sacrifice and scores more 
were seriously injured. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few mo-
ments to explain why the intended purpose of 
the January 6 insurrection—to disrupt the Joint 
Meeting of Congress to tally the votes of pres-
idential electors and announce the results to 
the nation and the world—was the greatest 
threat to the American Experiment since the 
Civil War when the proslavery forces would 
rather make war than let the nation survive 
and the pro-freedom forces would accept war 
rather than let the nation perish. 
The Framers understood and declared to 
the world that democratic governors derived 
their powers from the knowing and voluntary 
consent of the governed as expressed in free, 
fair, and unfettered elections unmarred by the 
influence or sabotage of any foreign country or 
entity not a member of the political community. 
The most important feature of a democracy 
is that it is the voters who alone can confer 
the legitimate consent and authorization nec-
essary to govern upon the governors who are 
then duty-bound to represent the voters’ inter-
ests, and only their interests.

May 19, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, the fundamental democratic 
compact between the governed and the gov-
ernors is that the latter’s authority and continu-
ance in office comes exclusively from the gov-
erned and allegiance is owed exclusively to 
the governed. 
This agreement can only be reached 
through free and fair elections, a breach of 
which threatens the vitality and viability of the 
social contract upon which democratic self-rule 
of, by, and for the people depends. 
Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln called the 
United States the ‘‘last best hope of man on 
earth’’ and stated at Gettysburg the impor-
tance of finishing the work we are in to ensure 
that ‘‘government of the people, for the peo-
ple, by the people does not perish from the 
earth.’’ 
By our actions in voting to establish and 
empower a National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol 
Complex, we are taking an indispensable step 
in ensuring the preservation of our democracy, 
which has been the envy of the world for more 
than 240 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me 
in voting for the rule and the underlying legis-
lation, H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security 
Supplemental to Respond to January 6th Ap-
propriations Act of 2021, and H.R. 3233, the 
National Commission to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6 Attack on the United States Capitol 
Complex. 
Mr. COLE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining 
for us on both sides. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CICILLINE). The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 61⁄2
minutes remaining. 
The gentleman from Oklahoma has 171⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage all Members here today to read 
today’s 
Washington 
Post 
editorial 
questioning Leader MCCARTHY’s polit-
ical courage in opposing this bill and 
calling for him to testify under oath 
about his eyewitness experience of the 
violence and former President Trump’s 
apparent indifference to it. 
The editorial also criticizes his false 
equivalence of Black Lives Matter pro-
tests to the Capitol invasion and his 
minimization of the insurrection’s sig-
nificance, which only encourages the 
lies on which it is based. 
I include that article in the RECORD. 
[From the Washington Post, May 18, 2021] 
OPINION: KEVIN MCCARTHY PLUMBS NEW 
DEPTHS OF POLITICAL COWARDICE 
(Opinion by the Editorial Board) 
Democratic and Republican negotiators 
agreed last week to create a high-level, ex-
pert commission with subpoena power to 
conduct an examination of the Jan. 6 Capitol 
invasion, one of the lowest moments in U.S. 
history. But House Minority Leader Kevin 
McCarthy (R–Calif.) on Tuesday threw his 
negotiators under the bus, condemning the 
compromise and vowing to oppose the bill 
creating the commission when it comes to a 
House vote Wednesday. 
Many Republicans do not want an impar-
tial panel to remind the public of their par-
ty’s role in the event. A fair inquiry would 
examine how GOP lawmakers fed the elec-
tion lies that inspired the mob, and how they 
built Jan. 6, which should have featured a 
pro forma counting of electoral votes, into a 
showdown over the 2020 presidential election. 
Republican lawmakers who signed a spurious 
lawsuit seeking to overturn the results bear 
some guilt; those who went on to object to 
the counting of electoral votes from several 
swing states bear even more. 
An honest proceeding would also require 
Mr. McCarthy to testify under oath about 
his eyewitness experience of the violence— 
and to then-President Donald Trump’s ap-
parent indifference. Mr. McCarthy has re-
sisted offering the public a frank accounting 
of his interactions with Mr. Trump, includ-
ing on a phone call during which Mr. McCar-
thy reportedly begged Mr. Trump to stop the 
mob. Mr. McCarthy has concluded that what-
ever political benefits he receives from em-
bracing Mr. Trump are worth the price of his 
integrity. 
If there are to be hearings, Mr. McCarthy 
argued, they should examine not only the 
Capitol invasion but other politically moti-
vated violence, such as the riots surrounding 
the Black Lives Matter protests last sum-
mer. The point is to draw a false equivalence 
between a historically unique attack on the 
nation’s seat of government, in which Mr. 
Trump and other Republicans are directly 
implicated, and crimes that left-leaning ac-
tivists committed—crimes that did not occur 
in the halls of Congress, that did not aim to 
interrupt the peaceful transition of power, 
that did not reflect a plot to overturn a pres-
idential election. 
Mr. McCarthy knows Democrats will never 
endorse a panel designed to mislead the na-
tion about Jan. 6, so his proposal for a broad-
er mandate is a ruse: He simply does not 
want any investigation at all. House Demo-
crats should nevertheless advance the com-
promise plan on Wednesday. Then the public 
will see whether there are 10 Senate Repub-
licans willing to approve the deal. Senate 
Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ky.) on 
Tuesday did not rule out supporting it, rais-
ing minor concerns about its structure that 
should be negotiable. But if Senate Repub-
licans capitulate to the calculations driving 
Mr. McCarthy, House and Senate committees 
should use their subpoena power to conduct 
their own investigations, even if that means 
Democrats lead the inquiries without Repub-
lican cooperation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN), a distinguished 
member of the Rules Committee. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, the 
January 6 insurrection against our 
Congress, our Constitution, and our 
election was one of the worst political 
crimes in American history. 
It interrupted the peaceful transfer 
of power. It injured, wounded, hospital-
ized more than 140 law enforcement of-
ficials 
who 
were 
punched, 
kicked, 
maced, spat upon, and speared by Con-
federate battle flags, Donald Trump 
flags, American flags. They had eyes 
gouged. One lost several fingers. 
They turned the Capitol of the 
United States and this Chamber into a 
crime scene. 
The independent January 6 commis-
sion legislation brought forth by Chair-
man THOMPSON, a Democrat, and Con-
gressman KATKO, a Republican, is bi-
partisan in composition: five Repub-
licans and five Democrats, equal sub-
poena power. It is nonpartisan in de-
sign and in function. 
Its whole purpose is to determine the 
events and the causes of those events 
on January 6 so we can prepare effec-
tively to stop it from ever happening 
again to the people of America. 
The key precedent was the 9/11 Com-
mission, which was critical for mobi-
lizing public attention to the dangers 
of al-Qaida and other foreign terror 
networks and helping us to rectify in-
adequacies in our security infrastruc-
ture and to prepare to defend our de-
mocracy. 
Today, the number one security 
threat facing the American people is 
domestic violent extremism, and we 
saw what domestic violent extremism 
can do when it broke into our House on 
January 6. 
According to the Secretary of Home-
land Security, Alejandro Mayorkas: 
‘‘Domestic violent extremism poses the 
most lethal and persistent terrorism- 
related threat to our country today.’’ 
Abraham Lincoln made a beautiful 
speech that I recommend to all of my 
colleagues before they vote on this leg-
islation today, the Lyceum Address, 
where he said all the armies of Europe, 
all the armies of Africa and Asia, could 
never conquer American democracy. 
But if there is a mortal threat to us, it 
will come from within, from dissension 
within, and threats to the constitu-
tional order from within. 
We must pay attention to what hap-
pened on January 6, and we must honor 
those brave men and women who 
fought for hours against medieval-style 
waves of violence raining down upon 
them on that day. And we must do 
honor to future generations of Ameri-
cans to find out exactly what happened 
and why, and how to stop it in the fu-
ture. 
Let’s pass this legislation today. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose the rule. 
The majority is proposing two signifi-
cant pieces of legislation today. Unfor-
tunately, concerns remain with both of 
them. 
H.R. 3237, the supplemental appro-
priations package intended to provide 
funds for the security of the Capitol 
complex is, unfortunately and unneces-
sarily, a partisan bill. 
It was the subject of bipartisan nego-
tiations, and there is no reason we 
could not have gotten to a bipartisan 
result had the majority wanted to do 
so. Instead, we are left with a partisan 
package that does not meet the needs 
of the institution and, frankly, has no 
chance of becoming law in its current 
form. 
I would urge my friends particularly 
to look at the section relating to the 
rapid response force. That is something 
where I think, honestly, with a little 
bit more reflection, we could find some 
common ground. 
I think it is a mistake to put a force 
like that under the control of either 
the District of Columbia or the execu-
tive branch. I think we need direct con-
trol of that ourselves. I know some of 
my colleagues on the other side feel 
strongly that way, too. It simply

makes sense that if we are having a 
crisis here, we ought to make the deci-
sion if we need an extra force. 
I think if we keep working at it, we 
are going to find some common ground 
there, and I hope that we do. 
H.R. 3233 establishes a commission to 
investigate the January 6 attack on 
the Capitol complex. Here, too, I want 
to acknowledge that real progress was 
made in the course of negotiations, and 
I want to commend particularly Chair-
man THOMPSON and Ranking Member 
KATKO for having brought us closer to 
agreement. 
However, on our side, many of us 
continue to have reservations about 
this bill and the parameters of the 
commission itself. After all, the events 
of January 6 did not occur in a vacu-
um. If we truly hope to find answers for 
the American people, then we must 
take into account everything, all the 
other political violence that has taken 
place in recent years. 
I would just ask my friends to go 
back—and I know they have—and look 
at the 9/11 Commission, which did ex-
actly that. It didn’t just look at 9/11. It 
looked at the attack on the USS Cole. 
It went back to the attack on the Afri-
can Embassies that we experienced. 
There is room here, I think, for con-
text and additional discussion. We also 
have concerns structurally with some 
of the staffing provisions and other 
items that I have mentioned that we 
hopefully would look at. We would like 
to continue to work on that. 
I think we could have made good 
progress had any of the amendments 
that were offered in the Rules Com-
mittee been made in order. My friends 
chose not to do that. That is their 
privilege to do so, but I think it prob-
ably obstructed what could have been a 
larger bipartisan vote for this par-
ticular piece of legislation. 
But, again, we will see going forward. 
What we do here isn’t the final arbiter. 
This is one stage in the process. The 
United States Senate is the next stop. 
Hopefully, there will be some changes 
made there. Then, it will have to come 
back here. We should look at both of 
these matters as stops in a journey, or 
parts of a journey, not as the final de-
cision on any of them. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the previous 
question and ‘‘no’’ on the rule, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I am deeply dis-
appointed that any of my Republican 
colleagues would oppose the creation of 
this commission. There is a lot of talk 
all the time about the need for biparti-
sanship, and that is what we have here. 
This is true bipartisanship. 
The distinguished minority leader 
sent a letter to Speaker PELOSI asking 
for an equal 5:5 ratio in appointments 
by Democrats and Republicans on this 
commission. He got it. 
He asked for coequal subpoena power. 
He got it. 
He asked for no inclusion of findings 
or other predetermined conclusions 
which ultimately should be rendered by 
the commission itself. He got it. 
Now, maybe the gentleman didn’t 
think he would, but Chairman THOMP-
SON and Ranking Member KATKO, who 
was appointed by the minority leader 
to negotiate on behalf of the Repub-
licans, came to a deal, a genuinely bi-
partisan deal to look into the horrific 
acts of what happened in this Chamber 
on January 6. 
I was here that day. They were not 
ordinary tourists who came in here. My 
colleagues on the Republican side who 
are here today, there are pictures of 
them helping to barricade the doors. 
They know exactly what happened on 
January 6. 
Those people who attacked the Cap-
itol were not here to make a political 
point. They were here to desecrate this 
building and hurt people. 
We, as Members of Congress, signed 
up for this job. But I want Members to 
vote for this commission, not because 
of us, but because of the people who 
work here, our staff, the support staff, 
the Capitol Police, the people who 
work in our cafeterias, the people who 
maintain this building. They were 
traumatized by what happened here. 
Our response to all of this is: Well, 
let’s move on. Let’s not do this, in 
spite of a truly bipartisan negotiation 
and a bipartisan commission. 
This is so disappointing. I mean, 
don’t talk to us about bipartisanship, 
and then when you get it, you turn 
your back on it. 
Madam Speaker, I am sick and tired 
of those who want to hover around 
mistruths and lies and spread con-
spiracy theories. What happened 133 
days ago can never be normalized. We 
all have to speak the truth, and we 
must act to prevent it from ever hap-
pening again. That starts with not only 
passing this rule but passing this bipar-
tisan bill to establish a bipartisan com-
mission to produce a report for the 
American people so that we know 
clearly and credibly as to what hap-
pened and that we can take additional 
actions to make sure it never happens 
again. 
As I said in my opening, vote for this 
out of respect for this institution, out 
of respect for our democracy, out of re-
spect for the truth, out of respect for 
the people who work for you, who come 
here every day and work for you. We 
owe it to them and to this country to 
move forward. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. COLE is as follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 409 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the

committed against Asian-American and Pa-
cific Islanders. The resolution shall be con-
sidered as read. The previous question shall 
be considered as ordered on the resolution 
and preamble to adoption without inter-
vening motion or demand for division of the 
question except one hour of debate equally 
divided and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary. 
SEC. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative 
days to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Mississippi? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3233, the National Commission to In-
vestigate the January 6 Attack on the 
United States Capitol Complex Act. 
On January 6, the world watched 
Americans storm the Capitol and en-
gage in violence to try and intimidate 
and prevent Congress from carrying 
out its constitutional duty to certify a 
Presidential election, a solemn process 
central to the peaceful transfer of 
power in our democracy. 
Many of us sitting here today were 
rushed out of this very Chamber by 
Capitol Police to safety as violent 
attackers roamed the halls, hunting for 
our colleagues and the Vice President. 
I was in the gallery that day watch-
ing the debate when this temple of our 
democracy was desecrated and debased. 
At least one Capitol Police officer 
died because of the violence that day. 
Others died, too. 
And there were extensive injuries as-
sociated with the attacks, not the least 
of which was the body blow to Ameri-
cans’ confidence that the reforms un-
dertaken after the 9/11 terrorist at-
tacks would make us more secure. 
Like the 9/11 attacks, the events of 
January 6 have cast a long shadow on 
our country. And like the 9/11 attacks, 
the January 6 attack raises funda-
mental questions about information 
sharing, 
coordination, 
preparedness, 
and response at all levels of govern-
ment. 
We need a bipartisan commission 
made up of experts to come together to 
give us an unvarnished view of what 
happened that day, examine why our 
systems failed, and develop bipartisan 
recommendations for reform to address 
any identified gaps.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2577 
May 19, 2021 
I am proud to be here with my part-
ner on the Homeland Security Com-
mittee, the gentleman from New York, 
JOHN KATKO, to debate a bill that es-
tablishes a 10-member commission that 
mirrors the 9/11 Commission, the gold 
standard for bipartisan commissions. 
The January 6 commission would be 
required to investigate and report on 
the facts and causes of the attack, in-
cluding relevant contributing factors. 
A commission of this nature, in some 
form, has been talked about by Mem-
bers of Congress, national security ex-
perts, and others for some time now. 
Over the past 4 months, discussion 
drafts have been circulated, pros and 
cons have been weighed, and obstacles 
have been overcome to get us to this 
day. 
Given how politically charged the 
events of January 6 have become, we 
need to come together in a patriotic, 
bipartisan way and approve this inde-
pendent body just as we created the 
9/11 Commission. 
The 9/11 Commission acted, not out of 
partisanship, but out of patriotism. We 
need that same sense of duty today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this year, we will ob-
serve the 20th anniversary of the ter-
rorist attacks on September 11, 2001. It 
will serve as a somber reminder of the 
fragility of our security, the bravery of 
our law enforcement and first respond-
ers, and the resilience of our democ-
racy. 
After the attacks on 9/11, Congress 
recognized the importance of estab-
lishing a bipartisan commission to in-
vestigate these brazen acts of ter-
rorism. This body recognized the need 
to find the truth and help all of us un-
derstand how these heinous acts that 
not only forever changed our country, 
but also the entire world, could have 
been carried out. 
The highly respected 9/11 Commission 
identified numerous challenges that 
needed to be addressed, which ulti-
mately led to many concrete rec-
ommendations that were later enacted 
into law. These critical reforms vastly 
improved our information sharing, in-
telligence collection, vetting capabili-
ties, and broader homeland security en-
terprise. 
The security breach that took place 
at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was 
completely unacceptable. It was a 
major breakdown in information shar-
ing and preparedness, much like the 
shortfalls that existed prior to 9/11. It 
was not only an attack on this institu-
tion but an attack on our law enforce-
ment brethren who defend us every 
day. 
Unfortunately, we know that the 
Capitol, Federal buildings, and even 
Members of Congress remain a target 
for extremists of all ideologies, as we 
all saw most recently during the April 
2 vehicle attack that took the life of 
Capitol Police Officer William ‘‘Billy’’ 
Evans. 
The bill before us today, H.R. 3233, 
would create an independent, bipar-
tisan commission to investigate the 
relevant facts and circumstances relat-
ing to the January 6 attack on the Cap-
itol, as well as targeted violence and 
domestic terrorism relevant to that at-
tack. 
It also charges the commission with 
providing and finding recommenda-
tions to, among other things, prevent, 
prepare for, and respond to similar at-
tacks; improve the security posture of 
the Capitol complex; and ensure the se-
curity of Members of Congress and con-
gressional staff. 
Modeled after the 9/11 Commission, 
this bill creates a 10-member panel 
with five commissioners appointed by 
each party and equal subpoena author-
ity. 
While the expedited December 2021 
deadline would only give the commis-
sion about 6 months to do its job, there 
is good reason for that: The American 
people and the Capitol Police deserve 
answers and action as soon as possible 
to ensure that nothing like this ever 
happens again. 
We must find answers to the many 
questions surrounding that day. What 
information was known leading up to 
January 6? Why was that information 
not shared with the proper entities? 
Why were Capitol Police officers left so 
unprepared? Who failed to provide 
them with support? Why did it take so 
long for reinforcements to come to 
their aid? How can we improve the de-
cisionmaking and bureaucracy that is 
clearly hampering the Capitol Police 
and the security of the Capitol com-
plex? How can we ensure that the Cap-
itol, Members of Congress, and our 
staffs are secure from attacks? And 
how do we ensure that this is a safer 
place for the members of the Capitol 
Police force who risk their lives every 
day to protect us? 
These are only a few of the many 
questions that need to be answered. 
The American people and the Capitol 
Police deserve those answers. 
As I have called for since the days 
just after the attack, an independent, 
9/11-style review is critical for remov-
ing the politics around January 6 and 
focusing solely on the facts and cir-
cumstances of the security breach at 
the Capitol, as well as other instances 
of violence relevant to such a review. 
Make no mistake about it, Mr. 
THOMPSON and I know this is about 
facts. It is not partisan politics. We 
would have never gotten to this point 
if it was about partisan politics. 
Thanks to the strong partnership 
with Mr. THOMPSON, the Homeland Se-
curity Committee remains a bipartisan 
committee focused on securing the Na-
tion while leaving partisanship at the 
door, which is exactly what the Amer-
ican people expect of us. 
Chairman THOMPSON and I were able 
to work together to block out all the 
political noise surrounding the Janu-
ary 6 attack and turn the Speaker’s 
partisan proposal into a reasonable, 
nonpartisan bill. 
Now, H.R. 3233 is nearly identical to 
the original commission bill, H.R. 275, 
that I, along with 30 other Republican 
cosponsors, introduced on January 13, 6 
days after the attack. 
I 
sincerely 
appreciate 
Chairman 
THOMPSON’s robust collaboration and 
strong commitment, as well as his 
friendship, by working together on this 
effort. The American people expect 
Congress to put partisanship aside for 
the sake of our homeland security. 
I fully recognize that in a diverse 
body like this, Members come down on 
different sides of different issues. I wel-
come that. We all should. That is 
America; because, after all, none of 
this is personal. It is about our mutual 
desire to keep America safe and secure. 
To my friends on both sides of the 
aisle, I welcome honest, vigorous, and 
civil debate. 
At the end of the day, I strongly be-
lieve this is fair and necessary legisla-
tion. I encourage all Members, Repub-
licans and Democrats alike, to put 
down their swords just for once and 
support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, let me just say to the ranking 
member, this won’t be the last time 
that we put together legislation for the 
good of this country, I assure you of 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
TORRES), the vice chair of the Home-
land Security Committee. 
b 1615 
Mr. TORRES of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, when I was sworn in the week 
of January 6, I never imagined living 
through an insurrection against the 
U.S. Capitol during the electoral col-
lege vote count. 
On January 6, I felt the same sense of 
shock and trauma that I had felt on 9/ 
11. Like most of America, I took for 
granted that the peaceful transfer of 
power is so natural as to transcend 
even the most turbulent period of par-
tisan politics. 
I was wrong. We were all wrong. De-
mocracy is too fragile to be taken for 
granted. It demands from all of us a 
vigilant defense. 
As Members of the United States 
Congress, we took an oath to defend 
and uphold the Constitution of the 
United 
States. 
The 
insurrection 
against the U.S. Capitol was a literal 
and metaphorical assault on the very 
Constitution we have been charged 
with defending. 
The January 6 Commission is, there-
fore, not a choice, but an obligation. 
We have a duty to investigate what 
happened and why it happened and who 
is responsible. 
As a Congress, if we are not able or 
willing to ascertain the full truth sur-
rounding an invasion of our very home,

May 19, 2021 
of our Nation’s Capitol, then why are 
we here? The 11th-hour attempt to sab-
otage a bipartisan, bicameral position 
is not a difference of opinion, nor is it 
politics as usual. It is an abdication of 
the oath that we took to uphold the 
Constitution. 
The United States of America is not 
a cult of personality, it is a Nation of 
laws. And our loyalty should not be to 
one political figure or one political 
party. Our highest loyalty should be to 
our country and the Constitution that 
governs it. 
We must never forget that the truth 
trumps politics. And if the truth is 
what we seek, then we have nothing to 
fear from bringing the clarity that 
only truth can bring to the chaos and 
confusion of January 6. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. MEIJER). 
Mr. MEIJER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express my strongest support 
for H.R. 3233, a bill to establish a bipar-
tisan commission to investigate the 
disgraceful January 6 attack on this 
institution. 
Let us be clear, the imperative to 
have a public, objective, fact-based in-
vestigation of the Capitol attack is not 
a partisan issue and it should never be 
treated 
as 
such. 
A 
violent 
mob 
breached this building to disrupt the 
lawful 
Presidential 
transition 
and 
threaten the lives of Vice President 
PENCE and Members of Congress. That 
this mob attacked the Capitol with the 
encouragement of prominent elected 
officials is a chilling reminder of Presi-
dent Reagan’s warning that ‘‘freedom 
is never more than one generation 
away from extinction.’’ 
Unfortunately, many who rightly 
criticized and condemned the attack 
that day have walked back their words 
or softened their speech. But even more 
troubling, there has been an active ef-
fort to whitewash and rewrite the 
shameful events of that day to avoid 
accountability and turn away from dif-
ficult truths. 
If we avoid confronting what hap-
pened here just a few short months 
ago, we can be sure that intimidation, 
coercion, and violence will become a 
defining feature of our politics. 
On the evening of January 6, as I was 
walking back to the Capitol after it 
was cleared of rioters, I received a text 
from a constituent who asserted that 
those who stormed the Capitol today 
were the true American heroes, that 
the election was a fraud, and that I 
must know that that was true. He then 
warned: ‘‘You can bet that there will 
be more blood on Congress’ hands if 
you let that stand.’’ 
I refuse to accept that possibility, 
this abrogation of our sacred obliga-
tion to the Republic. There is no re-
placement for an independent, bipar-
tisan commission with a mandate to 
produce a definitive report to the pub-
lic to clear away myths and fictions 
and get right on the facts. 
This is not picking at a scab. In order 
to scab over, a cut has to first heal. 
Rather than start to mend, the wound 
from January 6 was hastily bandaged 
and continues to fester. Only by airing 
it out and addressing what occurred 
can we hope to move past and heal. I 
applaud my friend, Congressman JOHN 
KATKO, for his good-faith, bipartisan 
leadership to put this commission in 
place. 
Mr. Speaker, I supported this effort 
in January, I support it today, and I 
urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today, as a member of the Com-
mittee 
on 
Homeland 
Security, 
in 
strong support of H.R. 3233, Chairman 
THOMPSON
and 
Ranking 
Member 
KATKO’s bill to form a bipartisan, inde-
pendent commission to investigate the 
January 6 domestic terrorism attack 
on the United States Capitol. 
On January 6, the world witnessed an 
attempted insurrection against our 
government to overturn the will of the 
American people. I know that because I 
was right here in this House Chamber 
that day as doors were barricaded and 
Members and staff were forced to evac-
uate. The mob that stormed our Cap-
itol, resulting in the death of a Capitol 
police officer, tore down the American 
flag and desecrated the seat of our de-
mocracy. These lawless thugs, led by 
members of extremist groups like the 
Oath Keepers, and Proud Boys, and 
Stop the Steal, attempted an insurrec-
tion. In the end, they failed. We gath-
ered back together here, uncowed, and 
the electoral college was certified. 
Mr. Speaker, but true healing cannot 
come without a serious investigation 
and real accountability. I am very 
proud that last night, the bipartisan 
Problem Solvers Caucus, 29 Democrats 
and 29 Republicans, came together to 
endorse this legislation, putting aside 
politics to get to the bottom of what 
happened that day. 
This bipartisan commission, modeled 
on the 9/11 Commission, will undertake 
an investigation into the facts and 
what caused the attack. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation will 
help us deter further would-be extrem-
ists, and provide the law enforcement 
homeland security community with 
the tools needed to protect the Capitol 
and our country from future attacks. 
I thank Chairman THOMPSON
and 
Ranking Member KATKO for their ex-
traordinary leadership and months of 
hard work together on the bill, the way 
governing should occur. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to join in sup-
port of securing and protecting the 
very foundation of our democracy. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. JEFFRIES), 
chair of the Democratic Caucus. 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the distinguished chair for his tremen-
dous leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, the January 6 bipar-
tisan commission will explore what 
happened on that fateful day, why it 
happened, and how do we prevent an-
other violent insurrection and attack 
on the Capitol from ever happening 
again. 
In the aftermath of the attack on 
Pearl Harbor, America had a bipartisan 
commission. In the aftermath of the 
September 11 attack, America had a bi-
partisan commission. In the aftermath 
of the attack on this Capitol on Janu-
ary 6, America should have a bipar-
tisan commission. 
The violent insurrection was an at-
tack on the Congress, the Constitution, 
and the Capitol. Lives were lost. More 
than 140 officers were seriously injured. 
A violent mob stormed this building to 
assassinate the Speaker, hang Mike 
Pence, and hunt down Members of Con-
gress. They urinated, defecated, and 
desecrated the citadel of our democ-
racy. 
It was a violent attack designed to 
bring about one objective; halt Con-
gress from undertaking our constitu-
tional responsibilities. And yet, a few 
of my colleagues seem to want to con-
vince America that it was all puppies 
and rainbows. We will not be hood-
winked. We will not be bamboozled. We 
will not be led astray. 
The January 6 bipartisan commission 
will find the truth, the whole truth, 
and nothing but the truth. And that is 
the American way. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Rhode Island (Mr. LAN-
GEVIN), the former Secretary of State 
from Rhode Island, who is now a mem-
ber of the Committee on Homeland Se-
curity. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 3233. On Sep-
tember 11, 2001, I was a freshman in 
Congress. We suffered attacks that day 
because of a failure of imagination. 
Since then, I have dedicated myself to 
getting ahead of the curve, to seeing 
over the horizon, to preventing another 
such devastating surprise. Yet, on Jan-
uary 6, I, along with so many others, 
was caught by surprise. 
In the past 5 months, I have re-
flected. What signs did we miss? Were 
we unprepared for a tide of American 
rioters? Why were some citizens actu-
ally taking the big lie about the elec-
tion seriously enough to actually com-
mit violence? 
The January 6 commission will an-
swer these and many other difficult 
questions 
and 
deliver 
a 
complete 
record for posterity of what could pos-
sibly have happened to bring about 
such a betrayal of our democracy. 
We will not defeat darkness with 
darkness. We need light. We will not 
defeat lies with lies. We need truth. 
This commission will bring forth the 
truth and it is only the truth that can 
truly heal the rift that is tearing our 
country apart.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2579 
May 19, 2021 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
THOMPSON and Ranking Member KATKO 
for their leadership. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, January 6 
is going to haunt this institution for a 
long, long time. No, it was not the joy-
ous day on Capitol Hill with our con-
stituents celebrating the start of a new 
Congress and a new administration. 
COVID came first, then this. 
So nearly 5 months later, we still 
don’t have the answers to the basic 
questions: Who knew what? When? 
What did they do about it? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, 
KATKO and THOMPSON, for the really 
good job on working together to estab-
lish a bipartisan commission seeking 
to find the answers to the questions 
that are still out there. 
Hundreds of people were arrested. 
People died. Millions of dollars of dam-
age to this building, feces spread on the 
walls, and, yes, the very core of democ-
racy, this institution, was threatened. 
I wasn’t in the Chamber that day 
when the breach was attempted, but I 
heard the shouts, saw the flash bangs, 
smelled the gas on that sorry day. And 
if it had not been for the brave Capitol 
and 
Metropolitan 
policemen 
and 
women that day, who knows how many 
of our heads would have been swinging 
on those gallows that were constructed 
on the east front of the Capitol. 
I talked to the exhausted SWAT 
team members, the police, and watched 
some of the body cams. I talked to 
some of our still-shaken colleagues 
who endured that day. 
Mr. Speaker, we need the answers, 
not political rhetoric. That is what 
this bipartisan commission can provide 
for all of us, for our country. Let the 
truth shine in. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from California, (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman 
THOMPSON
and 
Ranking 
Member KATKO for this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is simply about 
the truth. It is about the truth behind 
the assault on our Capitol on January 
6. Enough with lies. Enough with con-
spiracy theories. The January 6 com-
mission will have the power, power to 
find the truth. It will have subpoena 
power to compel people to testify, to 
testify under oath under penalty of 
perjury. 
An attack on our Capitol, an attack 
on our democracy, an attack on the 
election of our President—these cannot 
be tolerated, and they cannot happen 
again. 
What happened? What happened Jan-
uary 6? This bill is about sunshine, this 
bill is about transparency. That is why 
I ask for every Member on this floor, I 
ask you to vote ‘‘aye’’ on this most im-
portant measure. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I just want 
to note for the RECORD that the sub-
poena to which my colleague from 
California 
mentioned 
can 
only 
be 
issued if there is a consensus by both 
sides of the aisle on the commission. It 
is not something that one side can do 
unilaterally. And that is one of the key 
provisions 
of 
this, 
because 
it 
depoliticizes the process and it is a 
consensus-driven process. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN), a 
member of the Committee on Home-
land Security. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
and still I rise, and I rise today under-
standing that William Cullen Bryant 
was right: ‘‘Truth, crushed to earth, 
shall rise again.’’ Whether you believe 
that it was just a group of tourists 
walking through the Capitol or not, 
you should want this commission. 
b 1630 
If you believe that it was an insurrec-
tion, you should want this commission. 
You should want this commission be-
cause you cannot bury the truth in an 
earthly grave of lies and not realize the 
words 
of 
William 
Cullen 
Bryant, 
‘‘Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise 
again.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chair-
man THOMPSON and the ranking mem-
ber for standing together to make this 
moment 
possible. 
Bipartisanship 
is 
achieved when you have good decent 
people who can stand together for the 
good of all. 
God bless you, dear brothers. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairman and I thank the 
ranking member for showing, no mat-
ter how much confusion and upside 
down interpretation that leadership 
may give in changing their mind, truth 
will prevail. 
Let us show what America is today. 
Let us show what unity is today. Let 
me take a few moments to explain why 
the intended purpose of the January 6 
insurrection to disrupt the joint meet-
ing of Congress to tally the votes of 
Presidential electors and announce the 
results to the Nation and the world was 
the greatest threat to the American 
Experiment since the Civil War, when 
the pro-slavery forces would rather 
make war than let the Nation survive, 
and pro-freedom forces would accept 
war rather than let the Nation perish. 
Mr. Speaker, I was here on 9/11, and I 
understand what we did not get accom-
plished, yet when we became part of 
the Homeland Security Committee, we 
moved the 9/11 Commission that still 
stands as the standard-bearer for find-
ing out what happened. 
All the American people want, and 
those officers who were beat and beat 
and beat, is to find out the truth. This 
commission will help us find out the 
truth. It will answer the cry of those 
law enforcement officers who were 
called racial names. We will be able to 
explain why someone was trying to kill 
the Vice President, kill the Speaker, 
and kill Members of Congress. 
This is a truth time. Can we stand for 
truth? 
And might I add, I want to thank all 
of those officers who put their line in 
front for us. Let us get them the truth 
so the Nation will know the truth and 
so we can stand on the truth and be 
free. 
Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Sub-
committee on Crime, Homeland Security, and 
Terrorism, and a senior member of the Home-
land Security, and Budget Committees, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 3233, the National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the Capitol Complex Act, which estab-
lishes a national commission charged with in-
vestigating and reporting upon the facts and 
causes of the January 6, 2021, attack on the 
U.S. Capitol as well as the influencing factors 
that may have provoked the attack on our de-
mocracy. 
Specifically, the January 6 Commission’s 
mandate includes: 
1. examining and evaluating evidence devel-
oped by relevant Federal, State, and local 
governments, in a manner that is respectful of 
ongoing investigations, regarding the facts and 
circumstances of the attack; 
2. building upon other investigations regard-
ing the attack and targeted violence and do-
mestic terrorism related to such attack; and 
3, reporting to the President and Congress 
regarding its findings, conclusions, and rec-
ommendations for corrective measures taken 
to prevent future acts of targeted violence and 
domestic terrorism and improves the security 
posture of the United States Capitol Complex 
in a manner that preserves the accessibility of 
the Capitol Complex for all Americans, and 
strengthen the security and resilience of nation 
and American democratic institutions against 
domestic terrorism. 
Like the 9/11 Commission, the measure es-
tablishes a 10–person bipartisan commission 
with five commissioners, including the Chair, 
appointed by the Speaker of the House and 
the Majority Leader of the Senate and five 
commissioners, including the Vice Chair, ap-
pointed by the Minority Leaders of the House 
and Senate. 
Like the 9/11 Commission, the January 6 
Commission will be granted authority to issue 
subpoenas to secure information to carry out 
its investigation but only upon agreement be-
tween the Chair and the Vice Chair or a vote 
by a majority of Commission members. 
January 6 Commissioners must have signifi-
cant expertise in the areas of law enforce-
ment, civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, intel-
ligence, and cybersecurity. Current govern-
ment officers or employees are prohibited from 
appointment. 
The January 6 Commission will be required 
to issue a final report with findings regarding 
the facts and causes of the attack, along with 
recommendations to prevent future attacks on 
our democratic institutions, by December 31, 
2021. 
Like September 11, 2001, we cannot and 
must not ever forget the existential threat 
faced by our democracy on January 6, 2021, 
when thousands of domestic terrorists inspired

May 19, 2021 
by the 45th President stormed the U.S. Capitol 
in a violent, crazed, and desperate effort to 
disrupt the Joint Meeting of Congress pre-
scribed by the Constitution to tally the votes of 
presidential electors and announce the results 
to the nation and the world. 
Mr. Speaker, the morning of September 11, 
2001, is, and will always be, a day like no 
other. 
It is a day all living Americans will remem-
ber because not since Pearl Harbor had there 
been such a dastardly and deadly attack on 
American soil. 
My heart still grieves for those who perished 
on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 
77, American Airlines 11, and United Airlines 
175. 
When the sun rose on the morning of Sep-
tember 11, none of us knew that it would end 
in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade 
Center Towers in New York City and the Pen-
tagon and in the grassy fields of Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, as hard as it is to believe, out 
of a tragedy so overwhelming and horrific, 
something good and great emerged in the 
aftermath of September 11. 
On that day there were no Republicans or 
Democrats; there were no Northerners or 
Southerners or West or East Coasters. 
We were not Red State or Blue State; we 
were all simply Americans. 
On that day, we were united in our shock 
and anger and sadness and in our resolve to 
defend our country and protect the freedoms 
that has made America the greatest country in 
the history of the world. 
I experienced the same gamut of emotions 
on January 6: grief, hope, resolve, and fierce 
commitment to protect our country. 
Mr. Speaker, the assault on the U.S. Capitol 
by domestic terrorists and insurrectionists 
rightly takes its place as one of the darkest 
moments in our nation’s history since the Civil 
War. 
Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrection 
caused tragic loss of life and many injuries, 
while leaving behind widespread physical 
damage to the Capitol Complex and emotional 
trauma for Members, Congressional employ-
ees, and the Capitol Police. 
It bears repeating often that the Congress 
and the nation owe undying gratitude to the 
men and women who answered the call of 
constitutional duty and heroically won the day 
on that bloody and deadly afternoon. 
That is why I introduced H. Res. 169, a res-
olution commending the officers of the United 
States Capitol Police Department, the Metro-
politan Police Department of Washington, DC, 
and other law enforcement personnel for their 
selfless and heroic service in defense of 
American democracy in responding to the as-
sault on the United States Capitol by domestic 
terrorists on January 6, 2021. 
H. Res. 169 notes that the January 6, 2021, 
siege of the Capitol assault resulted in one of 
the worst days of injuries for law enforcement 
in the United States since the September 11, 
2001, terrorist attacks but that the officers of 
the United States Capitol Police Department, 
the Metropolitan Police Department of Wash-
ington, DC, and other uniformed law enforce-
ment officers stood their ground in defense of 
American democracy while being attacked 
metal pipes, discharged chemical irritants, and 
other weapons. 
The resolution conveys the thanks and ap-
preciation of a grateful nation to them for their 
selfless and heroic service, encourages all 
educational and media institutions throughout 
the United States to teach and celebrate the 
story of their heroism and patriotism; and calls 
upon all Americans to read, celebrate, and re-
vere the Constitution of the United States, fi-
delity to which is the surest best means of 
forming a more perfect union, establishing jus-
tice, ensuring domestic tranquility, providing 
for the common defense, promoting the gen-
eral welfare, and securing the blessing of lib-
erty to them and their posterity. 
Mr. Speaker, the domestic terrorists and 
seditionists who attacked the Capitol Building 
on January 6, 2021, were not, as some of 
their ardent defenders and apologists across 
the aisle have stated falsely, on a ‘‘normal tour 
visit’’; nor was their effort to lay siege to the 
Capitol and disrupt the processes of govern-
ment an act of persons who love their country. 
And it is absurd to suggest that it was a 
celebration of the United States and what it 
stands for when the leading edge of terrorists 
desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading 
the treasonous Confederate flag through the 
building and when, because of their insurrec-
tion, several members of law enforcement 
made the supreme sacrifice and scores more 
were seriously injured. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few mo-
ments to explain why the intended purpose of 
the January 6 insurrection—to disrupt the Joint 
Meeting of Congress to tally the votes of pres-
idential electors and announce the results to 
the nation and the world—was the greatest 
threat to the American Experiment since the 
Civil War when the proslavery forces would 
rather make war than let the nation survive 
and the pro-freedom forces would accept war 
rather than let the nation perish. 
Mr. Speaker, the Framers had first-hand ex-
perience with the types of abuses and 
usurpations committed by political leaders who 
ruled them but were not accountable to them 
and detailed many of those wrongs in the 
Declaration of Independence. 
The Framers understood and declared to 
the world that democratic governors derived 
their powers from the knowing and voluntary 
consent of the governed as expressed in free, 
fair, and unfettered elections unmarred by the 
influence or sabotage of any foreign country or 
entity not a member of the political community. 
The Framers understood that if elections are 
influenced by foreign actors or authoritarian 
forces within, then voters are reduced from the 
great role of citizens to mere subjects, and 
government for and by the people is a sham. 
The most important feature of a democracy 
is that it is the voters who alone can confer 
the legitimate consent and authorization nec-
essary to govern upon the governors who are 
then duty-bound to represent the voters’ inter-
ests, and only their interests. 
Mr. Speaker, the fundamental democratic 
compact between the governed and the gov-
ernors is that the latter’s authority and continu-
ance in office comes exclusively from the gov-
erned and allegiance is owed exclusively to 
the governed. 
This agreement can only be reached 
through free and fair elections, a breach of 
which threatens the vitality and viability of the 
social contract upon which democratic self-rule 
of, by, and for the people depends. 
Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln called the 
United States the ‘‘last best hope of man on 
earth’’ and stated at Gettysburg the impor-
tance of finishing the work we are in to ensure 
that ‘‘government of the people, for the peo-
ple, by the people does not perish from the 
earth.’’ 
By our actions in voting to establish and 
empower a National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol 
Complex, we are taking an indispensable step 
in ensuring the preservation of our democracy, 
which has been the envy of the world for than 
240 years. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 3233, the National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol 
Complex Act. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. CLARKE). 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the 
American people, our Republic, my col-
leagues, congressional staff, Capitol 
Police officers, and the late Officer 
Brian Sicknick, in support of H.R. 3233, 
the National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the 
United States Capitol Complex Act. 
Let me be very clear: What took 
place on January 6 in the United 
States Capitol Building was an act of 
domestic terrorism. To witness this 
hallowed place, the seat of our democ-
racy, being breached and invaded by a 
mob of incensed blood-thirsty individ-
uals, sycophants, all as we barricaded 
ourselves in our offices and on this 
floor, fearing for our lives, was dev-
astating beyond belief. It was an at-
tack on our democracy. Full stop. 
This commission is necessary to en-
sure all parties involved are brought to 
justice and the American people are 
made aware of the facts and causes 
that led to this heinous act of domestic 
terrorism. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, how much time do we have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Mississippi has 16 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from New 
York has 20 minutes remaining. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
SWALWELL). 
Mr. 
SWALWELL. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
today, our country has a choice: Our 
Constitution or chaos? 
Our democracy was attacked on Jan-
uary 6. We survived this once, but we 
will not survive another attack. This 
commission ensures that we are better 
prepared if one is to come to this House 
again. 
We don’t just owe this to our democ-
racy, we owe it to the men and women 
in uniform, who fought in hand-to-hand 
combat for hours to protect our lives. 
These are the cops that we see every 
day. These are the cops who take care 
of us. Three of them lost their life. One 
of them lost a number of fingers, and 
one of them had his eye gouged out. 
Don’t walk away from these cops.

May 19, 2021 
We can’t agree on much as a country 
anymore. We choose the news that 
agrees with us. But this commission 
cannot be spun. The testimony is the 
testimony. It is unimpeachable. It is 
going to be factual. And we owe those 
facts, the ground truth, not only to our 
democracy, but to the police officers 
who so bravely served us that day. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Miss RICE). 
Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 3233, the 
National Commission to Investigate 
the January 6 Attack on the United 
States Capitol Complex Act. 
This cannot be said enough. January 
6 was an act of domestic terrorism. An 
armed mob of insurrectionists stormed 
the Capitol intending to murder the 
Speaker, the Vice President, and Mem-
bers of Congress. 
We cannot let our friends on the 
other side of the aisle whitewash the 
events of that day. We cannot let them 
gaslight the American people by call-
ing January 6 an ordinary tourist visit. 
The 9/11-style commission we are pro-
posing in this bill will issue a full re-
port on the facts and provide rec-
ommendations to prevent future at-
tacks. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
truly 
appreciate 
Chairman 
THOMPSON
and 
Ranking 
Member KATKO for negotiating this bill 
in good faith. 
I thank my friend, Ranking Member 
KATKO, for actually recognizing the 
events of January 6 and working to 
find a bipartisan path forward, despite 
the opposition in his own party. That is 
a true act of courage and being a true 
American. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Mrs. DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, the in-
surrectionists attacked this very build-
ing we are standing in right now. The 
violent mob attacked, bear-sprayed, 
and beat down the police officers who 
protect us every day. 140 officers were 
injured, and we need to care about 
that. Some have died, and they de-
served better. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
accountability 
and 
truth are the foundation upon which 
all of our rights and freedoms exist. We 
need answers, and this commission will 
give them to us. We need account-
ability, and this commission will pave 
the way for full accountability. We 
need an independent commission, and a 
vote against it is a vote for a cover-up. 
Choose ye this day whom you will 
serve. Our democracy or the big lie? 
History will remember us. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BARRAGA´ N). 
Ms. BARRAGA´ N. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the National Com-
mission to Investigate the January 6 
Attack on the United States Capitol 
Complex Act. 
So many questions have surfaced 
since the attempted insurrection from 
January 6, but one question encom-
passes everything: What happened? 
A truth-telling commission will set 
the record straight about the January 6 
uprising, its causes, and potential re-
medial measures. This is about a fact- 
finding and truth-telling mission. It 
was the very absence of these two 
things that helped bring the insurrec-
tion on January 6. 
We can’t move on until we look back 
and make sure we know what hap-
pened, why, and make sure it never 
happens again. 
On behalf of fallen Capitol Police Of-
ficer Sicknick, the men and women of 
the U.S. Capitol Police, the congres-
sional and Capitol Hill staff that keep 
our offices running, and the American 
people, we must uncover the truth. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Virginia (Mrs. LURIA). 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, like all of 
us, I watched with horror as our Cap-
itol was overrun on January 6 by those 
seeking to overturn a free and fair elec-
tion. 
As a 20-year Navy veteran, I swore an 
oath multiple times throughout my ca-
reer to support and defend our Con-
stitution against all enemies, foreign 
and domestic. As Members of Congress, 
we swear the same oath, and we swear 
this oath, not as a member of a polit-
ical party, but as Americans. There is 
no carve-out for political expediency. 
I implore every Member of this body 
to uphold their oath and vote in sup-
port of this bipartisan commission. The 
American people deserve to understand 
exactly what happened that day in 
January. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues 
not to turn this into a partisan litmus 
test, not to pit Republican against 
Democrat, and not to perpetuate the 
big lie. Finding the truth should not be 
controversial or a question of partisan-
ship. 
This is about our shared future, the 
future of this Congress, and the future 
of democracy. We must do this to-
gether, and I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a list-
ing of national security, military, and 
elected officials, former Members of 
Congress, U.S. Attorneys, diplomats, 
all who have specific expertise in this 
matter before the body today. 
LETTER FROM FORMER SENIOR NATIONAL SE-
CURITY, MILITARY, AND ELECTED OFFICIALS 
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO CREATE A BIPAR-
TISAN 1/6 COMMISSION 
DEAR
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS: We are 
former senior national security, military, 
and elected officials who have represented or 
served Democrats, Republicans, or adminis-
trations of both parties. We write to encour-
age this Congress to establish an inde-
pendent and bipartisan national commission 
to investigate the January 6th assault of the 
U.S. Capitol Complex and its direct causes, 
and to make recommendations to prevent fu-
ture assaults and strengthen the resilience of 
our democratic institutions. 
We also write to you with great urgency in 
light of what we collectively see as an exi-
gent and growing threat. The events of Janu-
ary 6th exposed severe vulnerabilities in the 
nation’s preparedness for preventing and re-
sponding to domestic terrorist attacks. The 
immediate security failings that permitted a 
lethal breach of the Capitol Complex by 
armed extremists raise serious questions and 
demand immediate solutions. 
But January 6th was also the result of 
complex national security threats. These in-
clude coordinated disinformation campaigns, 
nontransparent financing of extremist net-
works, potential foreign influences, and 
white supremacist violent extremism, which 
the Department of Homeland Security iden-
tified in an October 2020 report as among 
‘‘the most persistent and lethal threat[s] in 
the Homeland.’’ As FBI Director Christopher 
Wray testified to you recently, ‘‘January 6th 
was not an isolated event. The problem of 
domestic terrorism has been metastasizing 
across the country for a long time now and 
it’s not going away anytime soon.’’ Under-
standing how these forces culminated in an 
attack on the infrastructure of our democ-
racy is critical to preventing future attacks. 
In the wake of September 11th, the admin-
istration and Congress jointly acknowledged 
that the attack’s causes were complex and 
that an independent and well-equipped na-
tional commission was an essential tool to 
aid the federal government. Congressional 
inquiries, law enforcement activities, and a 
national commission not only worked in par-
allel, but critically complemented each oth-
er’s necessary work. An independent com-
mission should not supplant the ongoing 
work 
by 
the 
legislative 
and 
executive 
branches, but it can uniquely support them 
by providing comprehensive and expert rec-
ommendations for Congress to act upon. 
Commissions—properly 
empowered, 
resourced, and led—can establish a full pic-
ture of events and an analysis of their 
causes, 
from 
which 
nonpartisan 
rec-
ommendations 
can 
authoritatively 
flow. 
With dedicated time, resources, and expert 
staffing, they can also exclusively focus on 
the matter at hand over an appropriate time 
horizon. Given the gravity of January 6th as 
a national security matter—the violent dis-
ruption to the transition of power and the 
continuing threat of future attacks—a na-
tional commission examining the lead up to 
the January 6th assault, and the attendant 
security lapses, is not only appropriate, but 
a critical component of the national re-
sponse. 
A failure to deploy the full suite of tools 
available to fully understand January 6th 
and address its causes will leave the Capitol, 
and the nation, vulnerable to future attacks. 
In bipartisan fashion, we have successfully 
marshaled these tools before, and we implore 
you to do so once again. 
Sincerely, 
(Note: All titles are former positions or 
military ranks held prior to retirement.)

rorism, National Security Council.

Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a 
joint statement from Governor Tom 
Kean and former Congressman Lee 
Hamilton in support of this commis-
sion. 
[From Issue One] 
JOINT STATEMENT FROM GOVERNOR TOM KEAN 
AND CONGRESSMAN LEE HAMILTON, CHAIR-
MAN AND VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE 9/11 COM-
MISSION 
‘‘We very strongly urge House Members to 
support H.R. 3233, the bipartisan National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Complex. 
That bill would create a 9/11 style commis-
sion to investigate the January 6th assault 
on the U.S. Capitol. That was a dark day in 
American history, one of the darkest. 
‘‘As Chairman and Vice Chairman of the 9/ 
11 Commission, unity of purpose was key to 
the effectiveness of the group. We put coun-
try above party, without bias, the events be-
fore, during and after the attack. We sought 
to understand our vulnerabilities in order to 
prevent future attacks or future acts of ter-
rorism. 
Today, democracy faces a new threat. The 
January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was one 
of the darkest days in the history of our 
country. Americans deserve an objective and 
an accurate account of what happened. As we 
did in the wake of September 11, it’s time to 
set aside partisan politics and come together 
as Americans in common pursuit of truth 
and justice.’’ 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD a let-
ter 
from 
Protect 
Democracy, 
Ian 
Bassin, Executive Director. 
PROTECT DEMOCRACY, 
Washington, DC, May 19, 2021. 
PROTECT
DEMOCRACY
URGES
REPRESENTA-
TIVES TO SUPPORT H.R. 3233, THE NATIONAL 
COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE THE JANUARY 6 
ATTACK
ON
THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL 
COMPLEX ACT 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On January 6th the 
very foundations of our democracy—and our 
Congress and Capitol that lie at its heart— 
came under attack. More than 130 days later, 
Members of Congress, their staff, and their 
constituents are still struggling to come to-
gether to understand what happened and how 
to prevent it from ever happening again. 
We strongly urge you to vote in favor of 
H.R. 3233, the National Commission to Inves-
tigate the January 6 Attack on the United 
States Capitol Complex Act, which would es-
tablish an independent national commission 
to comprehensively investigate the January 
6th attack on the U.S. Capitol Complex. 
This bipartisan bill is a measured and 
thoughtful response to the attack. It will 
bring together a bipartisan group of experts 
to examine the facts and circumstances sur-
rounding the January 6th attack. The Com-
mission is structured to ensure it is a bipar-
tisan endeavor: all reports must be agreed to 
by a majority of Commission members and 
the Commission may only issue subpoenas 
upon an agreement between the Chair and 
the Vice Chair or a vote by a majority of 
Commission members. 
The Commission will build on the work 
that has begun in various congressional com-
mittees to gather information and hold hear-
ings on the attack. It will not intefere with 
those ongoing efforts nor will it delay imme-
diate security fixes to the Capitol Complex. 
By creating this Commission, Congress can 
assure the American people, and all who 
work in the Capitol Complex, that these 
events and the circumstances leading up to 
them are thoroughly investigated outside of 
the pressured and partisan environment of 
Congress itself. 
We are grateful to Chairman Bennie 
Thompson and Ranking Member John Katko 
for their leadership in advancing this critical 
legislation, and we urge continued bipartisan 
support for the bill. Today marks an impor-
tant milestone toward seeking a shared un-
derstanding, protecting our cherished free-
doms, and restoring faith in government. 
Sincerely, 
IAN BASSIN, 
Executive Director, Protect Democracy. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, we have had a number of my 
colleagues come before us encouraging 
this body to support this commission 
and this legislation. They have spoken 
valiantly in support of it. They have 
put their hearts and souls into making 
sure that it is correct and proper. 
I am happy, again, to share with my 
colleague from New York. I appreciate 
working with him, and I appreciate the 
ability to work out our differences. I 
think it should be part of the role 
model for future legislation in this 
body. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives. 
b 1645 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I also 
thank him for his great leadership 
working with Ranking Member KATKO 
on bringing this bipartisan legislation 
to the floor for a bipartisan commis-
sion. 
Let’s talk about where we are. Here 
we are in the Capitol of the United 
States. The dome of the U.S. Capitol 
has always been a beacon of democracy 
and hope to America and to the world. 
Under this dome, our Nation has abol-
ished slavery; secured equal protec-
tions for all; ended a civil war; enfran-
chised women; established Medicare 
and Medicaid, voting rights and civil 
rights; and met the needs of the Amer-
ican people. 
Under 
this 
dome, 
schoolchildren 
learn about their country’s history and 
what we are doing to advance their fu-
ture. They come here and see us honor 
those who have contributed to the suc-
cess of our country: Washington, Lin-
coln, Jefferson, et cetera. But they 
know that our Founders, those patri-
ots, wanted us to be working for a bet-
ter future as we honor our history. 
Under this dome, when children learn 
about our country’s history, they also 
learn about what we are doing for their 
futures. Legislators pass laws. The 
press engages with our democracy, re-
porting on it. Staff and workers enable 
all of this to happen. 
This dome is a symbol of the deter-
mination of America. But this was not 
always so. Let us recall that the dome 
of the Capitol was built during the 
Civil War as our country was riven by 
brutal conflict. At the time, many said 
the iron and steel used for construction 
were needed for the war effort. They 
urged the President not to continue 
the work on the dome. President Lin-
coln said no. He knew that our country 
needed a symbol of strength and unity, 
a reminder of the shared ideals and 
common purpose that built our Nation. 
It was a beacon of hope to guide us 
through times of darkness, and he 
knew that the work must continue as a 
sign of our strength and the unity of 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, on January 6, and in the 
days, weeks, and months after, the 
Capitol dome was, once again, such a 
beacon. 
Would we prevail? 
January 6 was the day called for in 
the Constitution to validate the Presi-
dential election. It was not just an-
other day in the life of Congress. That 
day, one of the darkest days in our his-
tory, our temple of democracy was 
under assault by insurrectionists. 
The gleeful desecration of our Cap-
itol resulted in multiple deaths and 
physical harm to over 140 members of 
law enforcement and terror and trauma 
among staff, workers, and even Mem-
bers. 
The insurrection was called for to 
impede our constitutional mandate, 
but the Congress returned to the Cap-
itol that night to accomplish our pur-
pose. We agreed in a bipartisan way 
that day that we would return to the 
Capitol, and that sent an important 
signal to the world. 
The insurrection called for people to 
impede our constitutional mandate,

but we returned to the Capitol. Thanks 
to the courage of the Capitol Police, 
Members, and support workers, we 
showed the country and, indeed, the 
world that we would not be diverted 
from our duty and that we would re-
spect our responsibility to the Con-
stitution of the United States. 
We take that oath to protect and de-
fend the Constitution. Again, in a bi-
partisan way, we agreed to come back 
to the Capitol. 
Today, over 4 months later, many 
questions regarding the circumstances 
of this assault on our democracy and 
response to it remain. It is imperative 
that we seek the truth of what hap-
pened on January 6. 
To do that, Congress must, in a spir-
it, I believe, of bipartisanship and pa-
triotism, establish an independent and 
bipartisan 
9/11-type 
commission. 
Today, thanks to the leadership of 
Chairman BENNIE THOMPSON and Rank-
ing Member JOHN KATKO, legislation to 
create such a commission is on the 
House floor. 
It is important to note, Mr. Speaker, 
that this is happening 41⁄2 months after 
the January 6 insurrection. Mr. Speak-
er, my colleagues know, but many were 
not here at the time, legislation estab-
lishing the 9/11 Commission, 9/11/2001, 
was not signed into law until the end of 
November 2002, over 14 months after 
the attacks. 
So, people have been saying: How 
come we don’t have a commission? 
It takes time to build bipartisanship 
and come to agreement. Let us hope 
that the leadership that Mr. THOMPSON 
and Mr. KATKO have demonstrated will 
be leadership that we will follow and 
that we will continue in the most bi-
partisan way in order to seek the 
truth. 
Today, 4 months later, many ques-
tions regarding the circumstances still 
exist. This commission is designed to 
be impartial and experienced. The leg-
islation requires that the commis-
sioners be ‘‘prominent United States 
citizens with national recognition and 
significant depth of experience.’’ 
It also indicates that they should not 
be Members of Congress or elected in 
another capacity. Commissioners will 
be appointed from the highest echelons 
of government service; law enforce-
ment; civil rights, civil liberties, and 
privacy; Armed Forces; intelligence; 
counterterrorism; cybersecurity; tech-
nology; and law. 
The commission will be, again, bipar-
tisan and bicameral, with commis-
sioners appointed by the majority and 
minority leadership in the House and 
Senate. It will be actionable and effec-
tive, culminating in a final report on 
the facts and causes of January 6, 
along with recommendations to pre-
vent further attacks on our democratic 
institutions. 
I heard earlier Chairman THOMPSON 
acknowledge the support and endorse-
ment of the previous chairs of the 9/11 
Commission, Governor Kean and Chair-
man Lee Hamilton from Congress, the 
co-chairs of the 9/11 Commission. They 
had written to us earlier about the 
need for such a bipartisan commission, 
but they also wanted not only to find 
out the truth so this doesn’t happen 
again, but also to reinforce our com-
mitment to democracy and take us on 
a path that is better and more uni-
fying. 
That is a responsibility we have, and 
that is a hope that I have emerging 
from this debate and this vote today, 
that we will be able to have a strong 
bipartisan vote that takes us down a 
path more unifying for our country. We 
have this opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, the press says to me: 
Why don’t you just go do your own 
task force and your own select com-
mittee to investigate this? You have 
the votes, you have subpoena power, 
and you have this or that. 
I said: I don’t want to do that. We 
want this to be as it is shaped, bipar-
tisan with shared responsibility and 
shared staff in a way that the public 
will have respect for the outcome. 
To that end, 140 national security 
leaders have called for such a commis-
sion. This is what they have said: ‘‘The 
events of January 6 exposed severe vul-
nerabilities in the Nation’s prepared-
ness for preventing and responding to 
domestic terrorist attacks. The imme-
diate security failings that permitted a 
lethal breach of the Capitol complex by 
armed extremists raise serious ques-
tions and demand immediate solutions. 
. . . A failure to deploy the full suite of 
tools available to fully understand Jan-
uary 6 and address its causes will leave 
the Capitol, and the Nation, vulnerable 
to future attacks.’’ 
This list is nonpartisan, 140 Demo-
crats and Republicans. I don’t even 
know what party some of them are. 
I include their statement in the 
RECORD, Mr. Speaker. 
LETTER FROM FORMER SENIOR NATIONAL SE-
CURITY, MILITARY, AND ELECTED OFFICIALS 
CALLING ON CONGRESS TO CREATE A BIPAR-
TISAN 1/6 COMMISSION 
DEAR
MEMBERS
OF
CONGRESS: We are 
former senior national security, military, 
and elected officials who have represented or 
served Democrats, Republicans, or adminis-
trations of both parties. We write to encour-
age this Congress to establish an inde-
pendent and bipartisan national commission 
to investigate the January 6th assault of the 
U.S. Capitol Complex and its direct causes, 
and to make recommendations to prevent fu-
ture assaults and strengthen the resilience of 
our democratic institutions. 
We also write to you with great urgency in 
light of what we collectively see as an exi-
gent and growing threat. The events of Janu-
ary 6th exposed severe vulnerabilities in the 
nation’s preparedness for preventing and re-
sponding to domestic terrorist attacks. The 
immediate security failings that permitted a 
lethal breach of the Capitol Complex by 
armed extremists raise serious questions and 
demand immediate solutions. 
But January 6th was also the result of 
complex national security threats. These in-
clude coordinated disinformation campaigns, 
nontransparent financing of extremist net-
works, potential foreign influences, and 
white supremacist violent extremism, which 
the Department of Homeland Security iden-
tified in an October 2020 report as among 
‘‘the most persistent and lethal threat[s] in 
the Homeland.’’ As FBI Director Christopher 
Wray testified to you recently, ‘‘January 6th 
was not an isolated event. The problem of 
domestic terrorism has been metastasizing 
across the country for a long time now and 
it’s not going away anytime soon.’’ Under-
standing how these forces culminated in an 
attack on the infrastructure of our democ-
racy is critical to preventing future attacks. 
In the wake of September 11th, the admin-
istration and Congress jointly acknowledged 
that the attack’s causes were complex and 
that an independent and well-equipped na-
tional commission was an essential tool to 
aid the federal government. Congressional 
inquiries, law enforcement activities, and a 
national commission not only worked in par-
allel, but critically complemented each oth-
er’s necessary work. An independent com-
mission should not supplant the ongoing 
work 
by 
the 
legislative 
and 
executive 
branches, but it can uniquely support them 
by providing comprehensive and expert rec-
ommendations for Congress to act upon. 
Commissions—properly 
empowered, 
resourced, and led—can establish a full pic-
ture of events and an analysis of their 
causes, 
from 
which 
nonpartisan 
rec-
ommendations 
can 
authoritatively 
flow. 
With dedicated time, resources, and expert 
staffing, they can also exclusively focus on 
the matter at hand over an appropriate time 
horizon. Given the gravity of January 6th as 
a national security matter—the violent dis-
ruption to the transition of power and the 
continuing threat of future attacks—a na-
tional commission examining the lead up to 
the January 6th assault, and the attendant 
security lapses, is not only appropriate, but 
a critical component of the national re-
sponse. 
A failure to deploy the full suite of tools 
available to fully understand January 6th 
and address its causes will leave the Capitol, 
and the nation, vulnerable to future attacks. 
In bipartisan fashion, we have successfully 
marshaled these tools before, and we implore 
you to do so once again. 
Sincerely, 
(Note: All titles are former positions or 
military ranks held prior to retirement.)

Marie Yovanovitch, U.S. Ambassador. 
Dov S. Zakheim, Under Secretary of De-

Ms. PELOSI. After the bipartisan 
agreement on this commission was 
reached, 
the 
respected 
bipartisan 
chairs of the 9/11 Commission, Thomas 
Kean and Lee Hamilton, endorsed it, as 
was mentioned by the chairman and as 
I referenced earlier. 
I want to repeat it because I think it 
bears repetition: 
We very strongly urge House Members to 
support H.R. 3233, the bipartisan National 
Commission to Investigate the January 6 At-
tack on the United States Capitol Complex 
bill that would create a 9/11-style commis-
sion to investigate the January 6 assault on 
the U.S. Capitol. That was a dark day in 
American history, one of the darkest. 
As chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 
Commission, unity of purpose was key to the 
effectiveness of the group. We put country 
above party, without bias, the events before, 
during, and after the attack. We sought to 
understand our vulnerabilities in order to 
prevent future acts of terrorism. 
The chair and vice chair went on to 
say: 
Today, democracy faces a new threat. The 
January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was one 
of the darkest days in the history of our 
country. Americans deserve an objective and 
accurate account of what happened. 
Mr. Hamilton and Governor Kean 
said: 
As we did in the wake of 9/11, it is time to 
set aside partisan politics and come together 
as Americans in common pursuit of truth 
and justice. 
As I said earlier, Mr. Speaker, the 
Capitol of the United States has always 
been a glorious beacon of democracy 
for the American people and for the 
world. 
This legislation is about something 
larger even than the commission, vital 
as the commission is. This legislation 
is about our democracy, about ensuring 
that the Capitol dome remains a sym-
bol of freedom and about preserving 
America’s role as an emblem of resil-
ience, determination, and hope to the 
world. 
Indeed, 
creating 
this 
commission 
sends a resounding message to terror-
ists both at home and abroad: The com-
mitment of the United States Congress 
to the Constitution and to the Amer-
ican people is unshakeable. 
In establishing the truth of January 
6, this commission will protect our 
temple of democracy and our democ-
racy itself. It will ensure that such an 
attack shall never happen again. 
Can we just not wait, Mr. Speaker, 
for a time very soon when children 
come here to learn, where the press can 
cover in a more open way, and where 
the American people can come into the 
people’s House? 
That is what this Chamber has been 
called, the people’s House. They come 
to witness the debate that affects their 
lives. And whatever our disagreement 
about policy, they are assured that we 
are unified in our commitment in hon-
oring our Constitution and respecting 
the institution in which we serve. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong bipar-
tisan vote for H.R. 3233 to establish the 
national commission to investigate the 
January 6 attack on the United States 
Capitol complex. I do so with the great-
est appreciation and respect to Chair-
man BENNIE THOMPSON and to Ranking 
Member KATKO, and I hope, again, that 
the spirit of bipartisanship that they 
engendered in bringing this legislation 
to the floor will only grow as we go for-
ward with the commission and with its 
recommendations. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
Speaker for her comments. 
I want to reiterate for everyone to 
understand: The way that Mr. THOMP-
SON and I crafted this bill, we crafted it 
in such a manner to make sure it 
would be depoliticized entirely. There 
is an equal number of members on both 
sides appointed by both sides. They 
have equal subpoena power. They can’t 
subpoena one person without the other 
person on the other side of the aisle 
agreeing. They have to hire staff to-
gether, all those things. 
I want to make sure people under-
stand that we did this for a reason be-
cause that is exactly what made the 9/ 
11 Commission successful and made it 
effective. 
As someone who was in Federal law 
enforcement for 20 years before I took 
this job, I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, 
that our country is infinitely safer be-
cause of what the 9/11 Commission did. 
We are much stronger against ter-
rorism, and we share information in 
much better ways than we ever did—for 
example, the Joint Terrorism Task 
Forces, which are all over this country. 
I ask my colleagues to consider the 
fact that this commission is built to 
work. It will be depoliticized, and it 
will get the results we need because the 
Capitol itself and the Capitol Police of-
ficers will be better off for it. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mrs. 
GREENE). 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise in opposition to this bill and 
to the January 6 commission. I do so as 
a Member of Congress because I believe 
this institution’s duty is to serve the 
people of this country and not itself. 
In this past year, we have witnessed 
violent riots in American cities all 
over this country. We have witnessed 
tremendous damage. Minneapolis city 
officials estimate 700 buildings were 
damaged, burned, or destroyed, includ-
ing 360 local businesses. There has not 
been a commission launched to study 
the reasons why that happened. 
There has not been an investigation 
to stop the BLM and antifa riots that 
have hurt innocent people and at-
tacked government buildings and Fed-
eral courthouses, taken over police pre-
cincts, created autonomous zones in 
the city of Portland, and done so much 
damage to people all over the country. 
Studies show 570 protests in 220 dif-
ferent U.S. locations turned violent 
over the summer. The $1 billion-plus 
riot damage is estimated to be the 
most expensive in insurance history. It 
resulted in up to $2 billion of damages 
in 20 cities across the U.S., mostly con-
centrated in L.A., Detroit, Miami, D.C., 
and New York. 
b 1700 
As a person who was a victim of the 
January 6 Capitol attack, I can tell 
you that I am against the violence that 
happened that day, but I do not believe 
a January 6 commission will achieve 
any resolution because we have already 
had our Department of Justice arrest 
445 people, with 100 more to be arrested 
soon. 
There are also reports of people being 
held for 23 hours in solitary confine-
ment. That should not be happening. 
These people haven’t even had a court 
date yet. 
What is going to happen with the 
January 6 commission is the media is 
going to use this to smear Trump sup-
porters and President Trump for the 
next few years and cover up the real 
damage that is happening to the people 
of this country, which is tearing down 
our economy, ripping our borders wide 
open, and hurting this country. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
the majority leader of the Democratic 
Party. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding, and I thank 
the chairman for his work. 
I have been here a long time. This is 
my 40th year in the Congress of the 
United States. I came at the same time 
Ronald Reagan was elected President 
of the United States. It was clearly a 
time of difference in the House and in 
the country between Republicans and 
Democrats, but it was also a time 
when, frankly, the JOHN KATKOs of the 
Congress were in the majority in the 
Republican Party. And by that I mean, 
Mr. Speaker, people who wanted to 
work together to get results that, 
while not perfect for either side, were 
good for the country. 
So while I thank Mr. THOMPSON for 
the hard work he has done, I thank Mr. 
KATKO as well for doing what Ameri-
cans expect us to do, to come together, 
looking at a challenge to our country 
and to our people, coming to a decision 
to resolve those challenges and those 
problems. 
That is what Mr. THOMPSON and Mr. 
KATKO have done. Indeed, I think this 
is, in some ways, the best of days and, 
in some ways, the worst of days be-
cause we have seen today two Repub-
lican leaders turn what ought to be a 
nonpolitical issue, an issue with ref-
erence to a unique event, not just a 
demonstration that has occurred.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2587 
May 19, 2021 
I grew up in the 1960s. Whether it was 
civil rights or Vietnam, there were a 
lot of demonstrations. But the Capitol 
of the United States was not attacked. 
It 
was 
not 
invaded. 
It 
was 
not 
breached. 
The work of the Congress of the 
United States was not stopped because 
people were trying to get through the 
door, with some Members trying to 
stop them who then said: These are 
just tourists. 
It is sad because what the minority 
leader in the Senate and the minority 
leader in the House said is exactly 
what Mr. KATKO
pointed out. They 
wanted a commission that was even, as 
the 9/11 Commission was even, so that 
both sides would have an equal voice. 
What was the resolution that Mr. 
THOMPSON
and Mr. KATKO
attained? 
Equal division, equal voice. Not only 
equal voice in terms of numbers but, 
for instance, one of the things that was 
controversial was about subpoenas. Mr. 
THOMPSON and Mr. KATKO arrived at a 
resolution that said both sides have to 
agree, or alternatively, the committee 
can agree. In light of the fact that the 
committee is evenly divided, it would 
obviously have to be a bipartisan re-
quest for subpoenas. 
Now, what we didn’t agree on was the 
distraction and the dissembling. Let’s 
look at this corner; don’t look here. 
Let’s look at this corner; don’t look 
here. Let’s look at that corner; don’t 
look there. Don’t look at just the inva-
sion, the insurrection that occurred on 
January 6; look at everything else be-
cause maybe we can confuse the issue 
enough that we will lose sight of the 
insurrection on January 6. We ought 
not to do that. 
I have been here a long time, but I 
also know the history of the House, and 
I do not know of any other instance 
that is analogous to January 6, not 
one. 
In 1812, of course, there was a similar 
invasion, but it was from a foreign 
enemy. It was not the enemy within. I 
said that on the floor that morning as 
we finished the business of the House, 
notwithstanding the insurrection. 
Mr. Speaker, it is vital that Congress 
establish 
a 
bipartisan, 
independent 
commission to investigate January 6, 
not some other date. That does not ab-
solve any wrongdoing anywhere at any 
time. But it says that this unique in-
surrection is a danger to our democ-
racy, not to Republicans or Democrats, 
to our democracy, to our Congress, to 
the people’s House and the United 
States Senate, which was occupied. At 
least this House was not occupied. 
But Members were terrified, work 
was stopped, and democracy, for a 
short period of time, was overtaken by 
armed, violent insurrectionists. 
Certainly, each one of us ought to be 
very concerned about getting to the 
bottom of why that happened. How did 
it happen? How can we stop it from 
happening again? What are the re-
sources that we need, and, yes, who was 
responsible? Some, perhaps, are going 
to vote against this because that is 
what they fear. 
The 9/11 Commission, as Mr. KATKO 
pointed out, made America safer. It 
made this institution safer. It made 
our law enforcement more acutely 
aware of the failures that led to 9/11. I 
hope this commission does the same. I 
have talked to numerous Republicans 
who tell me they think it was right 
that we focused on January 6. Don’t be 
distracted. Don’t cover up or make it 
more lacking in clarity by trying to 
deal with every problem that we may 
have. Focus on January 6. 
Together, Mr. KATKO and Mr. THOMP-
SON negotiated a bipartisan agreement 
to move forward with such a commis-
sion based on input from Democrats 
and Republicans. There are going to be 
a significant number of Republicans 
who vote for this bill. 
Unfortunately, the truth has been a 
victim over the last couple of weeks. It 
was okay for LIZ CHENEY to tell the 
truth once, but when the former Presi-
dent of the United States kept telling a 
lie, and she said that is a lie each time 
that he said it, well, that was not ap-
propriate, so she was removed. But the 
truth was removed with her. See no 
evil, hear no evil. 
The commission, as a result of Rank-
ing Member KATKO’s participation in 
these discussions, will be equally com-
posed, as I said. It will have subpoena 
power that will be shared by both sides. 
I was pleased that we reached a bipar-
tisan agreement and sad for this insti-
tution, for this country, for the Amer-
ican people who must think: Well, 
can’t you agree on anything? 
The minority leader got what he 
asked for, yet he won’t take yes for an 
answer. Trump does not want this com-
mission. That can be my only expla-
nation. 
Throughout my career, both in the 
State senate for 12 years, as president 
of the Senate, and here in this body for 
40, I think I am known on the other 
side of the aisle as somebody you can 
work with. I hope that is the case be-
cause I think that is the way Ameri-
cans want us to work. 
President Trump opposes this com-
mission. I am not sure why. It is deeply 
disappointing that there is a division 
among Republicans about whether to 
support 
the 
ranking 
member 
who 
worked hard to get to this place and 
got what the minority leader asked for, 
except for the distraction, except for 
the dissembling. He didn’t get that. 
But he got everything else. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my Republican 
colleagues will think not about their 
politics, not about the former Presi-
dent, not about themselves. I hope they 
will think of the country, of this Con-
gress, of this House. As they do so, I 
hope they say to themselves: We will 
vote for this legislation. 
What if George Bush had said we 
shouldn’t have a 9/11 Commission, per-
haps out of fear that somehow the ad-
ministration would have been per-
ceived as being responsible for 9/11? 
They weren’t. Wouldn’t all of us have 
said: What are you talking about that 
we are not going to have a commission 
to see how we can protect the Capitol 
and why this Capitol was stopped from 
doing the work of our democracy? 
This legislation is going to pass. It is 
going to pass on a bipartisan basis, and 
I want to thank Mr. KATKO for having 
the courage and the integrity to stand 
up, fighting for what the minority 
leader asked for. 
I say to Mr. THOMPSON that that is 
the funny thing about this. I hope Sen-
ators will think long and hard about 
rejecting this bipartisan compromise 
to move forward, to protect our democ-
racy, and to lift it up as the beacon 
that it has been and needs to be not 
only for our own citizens but for all the 
world. 
How sad that day was as the world 
watched, as TVs showed them Amer-
ica’s citadel of democracy and of free-
dom invaded by its own citizens. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ It is the right thing to 
do. 
b 1715 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I had not intended to speak, 
but the careful mask of bipartisanship 
seems to have faltered here at the last, 
with the majority leader’s attacks on 
the minority leader, who has not spo-
ken, and the minority leader in the 
Senate for comments he has made in 
public but not in debate. 
So what was an image of bipartisan 
cooperation has now become one more 
partisan attack. It caused me to be-
lieve that it was important to stand up 
and say this: How can you have a bipar-
tisan commission with an all-Democrat 
staff? How do you do that? 
And why is it that there is no will-
ingness to look into all of the riots and 
the arson and the violence and the 
burning? If we are concerned about the 
danger that police officers were in on 
January 6—and certainly they were— 
then why don’t we have that concern 
for the dangers, the violence, the inju-
ries, the deaths that have been faced by 
police officers across this country? 
Why is one form of political violence 
equivalent to 9/11 when a blind eye has 
been turned by this Congress, or at 
least by the majority in this Congress, 
to that same phenomenon across this 
country for a year? Where is the in-
quiry into that? 
When the images are raised, the lurid 
images of insurrection—let me just say 
this. If it was an insurrection, it was 
the worst example of an insurrection in 
the history of mankind. It was a riot, 
it was a mob, it was significant, and it 
was troublesome. 
But this is not bipartisanship, and I 
fear that the gentleman from New 
York may find that he has been played. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2588 
May 19, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I am not going to argue 
with the previous speaker. I just say: 
Read the bill. And if you read the bill, 
you will understand it is a bipartisan 
bill. 
It is not a partisan bill; it is abso-
lutely bipartisan. The staff will be 
picked just like the staff was picked 
for the 9/11 Commission. It is just like 
the earlier bill the ranking member 
talked about, the Rodney Davis bill. 
We looked, Mr. Speaker, at this issue 
because the world saw what happened 
on January 6, and it is clear that we 
put together a bipartisan bill for the 
good of the country. It is in that spirit 
that we are here today. 
Mr. Speaker, how much time is re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Mississippi has 6 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from New 
York has 15 minutes remaining. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from New York (Mrs. CARO-
LYN B. MALONEY), the chair of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chair-
man and ranking member for their ex-
traordinary leadership, for doing the 
right thing, and for working to make 
this country safer and stronger. 
Like my friend on the other side of 
aisle from North Carolina, I didn’t in-
tend to speak either. 
As a New Yorker, I was closely in-
volved in supporting the work of the 9/ 
11 Commission. It, too, like January 6, 
was one of the darkest days in the his-
tory of our country, and we needed an-
swers on how such a horrible thing 
could happen. Almost 3,000 people were 
murdered just because they went to 
work that day. Many things needed to 
be answered. 
This body came together. We were 
united; we were determined; we passed 
the Commission. We had two out-
standing leaders, Governor Kean and 
Lee Hamilton. They did everything to-
gether. They issued a report that sold 
more copies than Harry Potter. I nomi-
nated it for a National Book Award. It 
laid out what happened so clearly from 
their joint investigations. More impor-
tantly, it told us what to do about it. 
They had a series of recommendations 
to make this country safer. 
This body worked together and en-
acted most of them, and it did make 
this country safer. In fact, I get peri-
odic reports from the law enforcement 
in my city on attempts to hurt us and 
how the reforms and the programs we 
put in place are helping us, making us 
stronger and protecting us better. 
We need this January 6 commission, 
for the sake of America. Let’s stop 
fighting long enough to work together 
to help our country understand what 
happened. 
Why did it take 4 hours for the Na-
tional Guard to respond? In New York, 
they would have been there in 10 min-
utes. Why didn’t they respond to all of 
the news reports about what was hap-
pening? We need answers. Let’s come 
together and work together and get 
them. 
A January 6 commission, I urge for 
the sake of the country, everyone 
should vote for it. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, look, 
things have changed a lot since the 9/11 
Commission. Back then, we did not 
have a problem on either side of the 
aisle 
condemning 
anti-Semitic 
re-
marks. Now one side has a problem 
doing that. 
Back then, we had never, in the his-
tory of Congress, had one party com-
mit what arguably is felony, up to 20 
years in prison, by preventing an ongo-
ing session of Congress, the exact 
charge, 18 USC 1512, that is being al-
leged against people that came in. As a 
judge, I would have no problem sen-
tencing anybody that broke into the 
Capitol, anybody that committed a 
crime here. 
But let’s be real. The partisanship 
has been dramatic. That is why it is 
different now than the 9/11 Commis-
sion. Let’s get back to being bipartisan 
and not use every tool as a partisan 
stick to beat Republicans with. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of this bill, the Na-
tional Commission to Investigate the 
January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
I want to thank Chairman THOMPSON 
and Ranking Member KATKO for bring-
ing this bill to the floor. 
On January 6, we witnessed one of 
the darkest moments in our Nation’s 
history when a violent mob attacked 
the U.S. Capitol. These individuals 
desecrated the Halls of Congress, at-
tacked 
law 
enforcement, 
and 
at-
tempted to stop the democratic proc-
ess. The clearest way for us to uphold 
our oath to defend the Constitution 
and protect this institution, our de-
mocracy, from those who directly at-
tempted to thwart its operations, is 
through 
an 
independent, 
evenly-di-
vided, bipartisan commission. We need 
to understand not just what were the 
breakdowns in security and the failures 
of our intelligence, but why. What are 
those issues which caused fellow Amer-
icans to believe they needed to over-
throw their government? 
Those who believe the former Presi-
dent had no culpability should not be 
afraid of a commission that derives its 
power from both sides equally. 
I ask all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this bill. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from New York for his work 
on this effort. I appreciate my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
and the intent of what we are trying to 
accomplish. 
Obviously, we are all very concerned 
and should be concerned about what 
occurred on January 6, all of us who 
were here in the Chamber, all of us who 
saw what unfolded. 
My concern, and the reason that I am 
opposing this legislation, is that I be-
lieve we have got a significant amount 
of power with our existing structures 
in place, the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, and otherwise. While the inves-
tigation is going on at the Department 
of Justice, we ought to be looking at 
that and using those powers to do what 
we can to seek the truth wherever it 
may lead. 
I have questions right now for the 
Department of Justice. We have got 450 
Americans who have been arrested. I 
don’t know for how long, I don’t know 
how many of them are in jail, or for 
what period of time. We are trying to 
look into that. I have sent letters to 
the Department of Justice to get those 
answers. 
I wish the gentlewoman who spoke, 
the chair of the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, would afford us the 
ability to call people forward from the 
Department of Justice. Let’s inquire as 
to what is going on. Let’s inquire about 
the investigations. Let’s inquire about 
the facts that have been found. Let’s 
use the powers that we have and the 
powers of this body and the commit-
tees we have to seek the information 
and the truth, wherever it may lead. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank Chairman THOMPSON for 
his leadership. 
While the events of January 6 were 
devastating and will stain our coun-
try’s history forever, I have no doubt 
that democracy will prevail. 
This Nation has fought back against 
hatred, authoritarianism, and fascism 
since the very founding. 
Yes, I stand proudly today to ask for 
a January 6 commission so that we can 
develop a full public record that will 
let us know how we can avoid this in 
the future. 
We should all vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I just want to take a 
few moments to address some of the ar-
guments that have been made here 
today, and some of the arguments that 
have been made in opposition to this 
bill. 
One of them is talking about the 
scope of the commission being too nar-
row. I want to note that the commis-
sion is granted sufficient scope and 
flexibility to investigate targeted vio-
lence and domestic terrorism relevant 
to the January 6 attack. It will be up 
to the commission to decide how far 
they want to go with that perimeter. 
Do I feel that the attack on the Cap-
itol on April 2 that killed a Capitol Po-
lice Officer is relevant? I do. I hope the 
commission does, too.

May 19, 2021 
Do I feel that the June 17 attack on 
Republican Members of Congress is rel-
evant to the January 6 attack? I do. I 
hope the commission does. They have 
the flexibility to do so, if they want. 
If there are other issues outside of 
this scope, we can look into them. We 
can have separate legislation. I encour-
age my colleagues, who are concerned 
about that, to do that. 
Another charge I heard was that the 
commission could be controlled by par-
tisan staff hired unilaterally by the 
commission chair. That is simply not 
true. 
Here is what the bill does. It requires 
consultation between the chair, ap-
pointed by the Democrats, and the vice 
chair, appointed by the Republicans, 
for any hiring of staff. Further, it re-
quires that it be in accordance with the 
rules agreed upon by the commission. 
The commission creates the rules as a 
team. They then hire as a team. 
Lastly, there has been some concerns 
or arguments made about the criminal 
investigations. Make no mistake about 
it. This commission has nothing to do 
with the criminal investigations. This 
commission, by law, cannot interfere 
with criminal investigations. Criminal 
investigations alone won’t get us what 
we need, like the 9/11 Commission con-
cluded. It won’t get us the rec-
ommendations, the insight, the exper-
tise from the people on the commission 
who can come in, look at the Capitol 
security matrix, and say this is what 
needs fixing. A prosecutor can’t tell 
you that. The commission can. That is 
what we want to do. 
Second, the bill specifically requires 
the commission to respect ongoing in-
vestigations and build upon the inves-
tigations, learn from them, and avoid 
unnecessary duplication. 
This language, in that respect, goes 
further than the 9/11 Commission in 
H.R. 275 in granting deference to other 
ongoing investigations. 
So I just want to make sure people 
are clear about that going forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 1730 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the gentleman from New York 
and the other Republicans who are sup-
porting this for their bipartisanship. 
To the other 90 percent of our friends 
on the other side of the aisle, holy cow. 
Incoherence. No idea what you are 
talking about. 
Benghazi, 
you 
guys 
chased 
the 
former Secretary of State all over the 
country, spent millions of dollars. We 
have people scaling the Capitol, hitting 
the Capitol Police with lead pipes 
across the head, and we can’t get bipar-
tisanship. 
What else has to happen in this coun-
try? 
This is a slap in the face to every 
rank-and-file cop in the United States. 
If we are going to take on China, if 
we are going to rebuild the country, if 
we are going to reverse climate change, 
we need two political parties in this 
country that are both living in reality, 
and you ain’t one of them. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask that 
we all take a deep breath right now. 
Everybody breathe for a minute and 
everybody stop the theatrics, and ev-
erybody stop the arguments that are 
not relevant to this issue. 
This is a very solemn moment. We 
are here to talk about something that 
is very important to the entire of our 
Government and the entire of our 
country. I ask that we think about the 
officers and their families and conduct 
ourselves accordingly. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gen-
tlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. WAT-
SON COLEMAN). 
Mrs. 
WATSON 
COLEMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to say that Janu-
ary 6 was a frightening experience. It 
was an assault upon the fundamentals 
of this Government. It was an assault 
upon the place I thought I was going to 
be the safest I could possibly be, and 
we politicize this. 
This is an opportunity to bring this 
bipartisan commission into existence 
so that we can get out of the politics of 
it and look at the facts that happened, 
the evidence that happened, and the 
recommendations that will ensue from 
that effort. 
I wholeheartedly support this effort. 
I am grateful for the bipartisanship of 
it, and I pray that all of our colleagues 
will support this. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time remains? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 91⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Mis-
sissippi has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close and I yield myself the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation is not 
about partisan politics. It is about 
finding the truth and addressing the 
vulnerabilities of our security appa-
ratus so that we can emerge stronger 
and better prepared. 
The January 6 attack was a com-
pletely preventable failure of intel-
ligence, information sharing, decision-
making, and preparedness. The Capitol 
Police and D.C. police suffered greatly 
and continue to suffer as a result. 
The institutions of our democracy 
are and will continue to be a target for 
extremists set on using violence to fur-
ther their ideology. We, in Congress, 
owe it to this Nation, to our constitu-
ents, and to the dedicated men and 
women who risk their lives every sin-
gle day to protect those institutions— 
and I honor them—to see that we learn 
from those attacks, that we get an-
swers to the hard questions, and that 
we do not repeat the mistakes of the 
past. 
Capitol 
Police 
Officers 
Brian 
Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, as 
well as D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey 
Smith, all lost their lives in the wake 
of the January 6 attack. Over 140 more 
law enforcement officers—140—were in-
jured as a result of that attack. 
Less than 4 months later, on April 2, 
Capitol Police Officer William ‘‘Billy’’ 
Evans was killed and another officer 
was injured when yet another extrem-
ist attacked the Capitol. 
And, of course, we can’t forget the 
2017 terrorist attack against Repub-
lican Members of Congress during prac-
tice for the Congressional Baseball 
Game. Were it not for the officers in-
volved, there would be scores of dead 
Congressmen. That is the plain truth. I 
acknowledge 
the 
heroic 
efforts 
of 
David Bailey and Crystal Griner. 
We owe it to all of these officers and 
their families to ensure that nothing 
like this ever happens again. This leg-
islation is modeled directly on the leg-
islation that created the 9/11 Commis-
sion. I sincerely believe that this com-
mission, with strong support from this 
body, will embark on an objective, non-
partisan search for answers and solu-
tions, just as the 9/11 Commission did. 
Again, I want to thank my friend, 
Chairman THOMPSON, for his partner-
ship. 
I urge everyone in the body, on both 
sides—not just my side and not just the 
other side, all of us—to set aside poli-
tics just this once—just this once. I beg 
Members to pass this bill. 
I was a prosecutor for 20 years prior 
to coming here to Congress, and many 
times we would meet at 4:30 in the 
morning or 5:00 in the morning, and 
they would get ready to go out and do 
the raids and arrest very, very dan-
gerous people. I was always the last 
person to see them before they went 
out to get these awful, dangerous peo-
ple off the street: drug dealers, mur-
derers, violent people. They did their 
job every day, and I was sending them 
into harm’s way. It always made my 
heart sink. 
Imagine being a family member of 
these officers who do this. So let’s take 
a deep breath and think about what is 
really important here. These people, 
every single day, are willing to lay 
down their lives for us. 
They deserve better, and we are 
going to deliver this. We are going to 
deliver it on behalf of Capitol Police 
Officer Brian Sicknick. We are going to 
deliver it on behalf of Capitol Police 
Officer Howard Liebengood. We are 
going to deliver it on behalf of Capitol 
Police Officer William ‘‘Billy’’ Evans. 
We are going to deliver it on behalf of 
D.C. Police Officer Jeffrey Smith. We 
are going to deliver it on behalf of D.C. 
Police Officer Michael Fanone and so 
many others who struggle with the 
events of that day. We do so on behalf 
of the people who risked their lives for 
us and continue to, like Capitol Police

Officer David Bailey and Capitol Police 
Officer Crystal Griner. 
I want these officers and their fami-
lies to know that we are doing it not 
for us and not for politics. We are doing 
it for them. We are doing it for them. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
At the outset, let me salute Mr. 
KATKO for his agreeing to work in a bi-
partisan manner so that we can get 
this bill to the floor and adopted today. 
Mr. Speaker, we are here today at a 
unique moment in American history. 
Trust in our government’s ability to 
share information and coordinate at all 
levels to keep our democracy secure 
was severely shaken by the January 6 
attack. 
We need a bipartisan commission 
with experts who put country ahead of 
party to come together, just as the 
commission did, to lay out the facts 
and proposed solutions to make us 
more secure. 
When the chairman of the 9/11 Com-
mission issued their final report, they 
concluded a message to the public. It 
asked that each of us remember how 
we felt on that day of the attack. It 
asked that we recall the grief and sor-
row. 
This moment is no less historic, no 
less important, no less momentous, and 
it requires the same common action, 
both as Congress and as a country. 
I, too, salute the brave men and 
women of the Capitol Police who put 
their lives on the line on January 6 
protecting this citadel of democracy, 
and it is in their spirit that I ask that 
you vote in support of this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, the 
chairman and ranking member of the House 
Homeland Security Committee have nego-
tiated in good faith over several weeks a bi-
partisan bill—H.R. 3233—to establish a ten- 
member national commission to investigate 
the January 6th attack on the Capitol. 
I’m voting yes. 
If enacted into law both the Republican and 
Democrat leaders would each select five com-
missioners who would be tasked with inves-
tigating the ‘‘facts and causes’’ of the attack. 
The Commission may issue subpoenas, but 
subpoenas may only be issued by agreement 
between the Chair and Vice Chairperson of 
the Commission—one Democrat and one Re-
publican—or by the vote of a majority of the 
members of the Commission. 
Any interim report, or the final report—which 
must be submitted to the President and Con-
gress no later than December 31, 2021—must 
be agreed to by a majority of Commission 
members. 
According to the text of H.R. 3233, the final 
report should include ‘‘findings, conclusions, 
and recommendations, which may include 
changes in law, policy, procedures, rules, or 
regulations, to improve the detection, preven-
tion, preparedness for, and response to tar-
geted violence and domestic terrorism and im-
prove the security posture of the United States 
Capitol Complex and ensure the security of 
Members of Congress and staff.’’ 
The attack on January 6 resulted in a tragic 
loss of life and physical injury. 140 Capitol and 
D.C. police officers were injured on January 
6th, including 15 who were hospitalized. Three 
police officers later died—including a brave 
Capitol police officer from New Jersey, Brian 
Sicknick, who died of a stroke on January 7th 
and two other officers died by suicide. Four ri-
oters died—one was shot by police. 
It is my hope that the Commission will es-
tablish the truth and provide a way forward to 
ensure that such an attack never happens 
again. 
Ms. SLOTKIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
express my strong support for H.R. 3233, 
which would create an independent, bipartisan 
‘‘National Commission to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6 Attack on the United States Capitol 
Complex.’’ 
The attack on the Capitol was one of the 
darkest days in our Nation’s history—an as-
sault on the foundation of our democratic sys-
tem, and an attempt to stop Congress’s work 
through violence. I am proud that we didn’t let 
the attempt succeed: thanks to the heroism 
and incredible sacrifices of the U.S. Capitol 
Police that day to defend the heart of our de-
mocracy, both houses of Congress returned to 
the Capitol and worked through the night to 
certify and uphold the will of the American 
people. 
Now, it is our duty to ensure that such an 
attack on our democracy is never able to hap-
pen again. That work begins with ensuring 
that we have an honest, independent inves-
tigation of what happened that day and how it 
was possible—a task perfectly suited for the 
commission the House has voted to create 
today, with bipartisan support. This bill creates 
a 1/6 Commission that follows the model set 
by the 9/11 Commission, whose landmark in-
vestigation wasn’t just for Washington insiders 
or policy wonks, but the American people. 
The 9/11 Commission’s final report was writ-
ten in easily accessible prose, and published 
as a bestselling paperback which was avail-
able in bookstores and newsstands across the 
country. It helped ordinary Americans under-
stand how such an appalling attack had been 
possible, who needed to be held accountable, 
and what we as a nation had to do to ensure 
it would never happen again. 
And two decades later, its impact hasn’t 
faded: even today, a whole generation of 
Americans who were just children on 9/11, or 
were even born after the attacks, have looked 
to the Commission’s work to help them make 
sense of that dark chapter in our history. 
The Commission also delivered a vital 
wake-up call to our national security establish-
ment. As one of the first dozen staff members 
at the Office of the Director of National Intel-
ligence, which grew out of the 9/11 Commis-
sion’s recommendations, I saw firsthand how 
the Commission’s independent investigation 
pushed our government to meet the serious 
challenges we faced. I keep my original, dog- 
eared copy of the 9/11 Commission report in 
my congressional office as a constant re-
minder, because it drove systemic change 
where systemic failures had occurred. 
The 1/6 Commission that the House has ap-
proved today is built on the same principles 
that enabled the success of the 9/11 Commis-
sion: It has a bipartisan structure—five Repub-
licans, five Democrats—and bipartisan support 
in Congress. 
It will operate by consensus and will have 
the subpoena power, budget and staff needed 
to conduct a proper investigation. 
And it has a mandate to look at the full 
scope of facts and causes that led to or influ-
enced this specific, unprecedented attack on 
our democracy. As those of us from Michigan 
are well aware, this attack didn’t happen in 
isolation. It was the result of months, if not 
years, of escalating rhetoric and activity— 
which is why it’s vital that this commission has 
a strong, focused mandate. 
But even beyond its structure, what charac-
terized the 9/11 Commission’s work was a 
commitment among its members to work to-
gether in good faith, to uncover the truth be-
hind what led to the attack on our Nation, no 
matter how disturbing or painful. 
As Governor Tom Kean and Congressman 
Lee Hamilton, the bipartisan leaders of the 
9/11 Commission, said in a statement today, it 
was their commitment to ‘‘put country over 
party, without bias’’ that led to the ‘‘unity of 
purpose [that] was key to [its] effectiveness.’’ 
The Commission’s findings and work were 
seen as objective and legitimate because of 
that combination of structure and patriotic, 
good faith commitment—the model only works 
if we have both. 
That’s why it’s so important that this is, from 
its very design, a bipartisan initiative. To that 
end, I want to take a moment to thank Chair-
man THOMPSON and Ranking Member KATKO 
for their leadership and their commitment to 
finding this consensus. 
As a member of the Committee on Home-
land Security, and as Chair of the Sub-
committee on Intelligence and Counterter-
rorism, I have been honored to work alongside 
them both over the past few years. Their col-
laboration sets an example that we would all 
do well to follow. 
We cannot allow this vital inquiry to turn into 
a political football—it’s simply too important to 
our country. That’s why I opposed an early 
proposal for this bill that skewed the number 
of commissioners towards Democratic ap-
pointees. 
I’m committed to ensuring that this commis-
sion has the credibility it needs to take on this 
investigation, and I am pleased that the bill we 
passed today gives it the structural integrity it 
needs. That’s why I urge my Republican col-
leagues in the Senate to take the time, and do 
what I did last week: actually sit down and 
read this bill. 
Print out a copy of it, as well a copy of the 
bill from 2002 which created the 9/11 Commis-
sion. Put them side-by-side, take out a pen 
and mark up the similarities. 
You’ll see that in so many cases, this bill 
uses the exact same language on scope, par-
ticipation and authorities as the 9/11 Commis-
sion authorization, which was approved by a 
Republican-led House, and signed into law by 
a Republican president. 
Because, let’s be clear: if you oppose this 
bill and the commission it creates, you would 
have opposed the 9/11 Commission twenty 
years ago. The American people deserve the 
truth, and we owe it to them as their elected 
representatives to ensure they hear it in its en-
tirety from an independent and objective body 
they can trust. And if you oppose this bipar-
tisan legislation, you are choosing political ex-
pediency over ensuring that our citizens hear 
the truth they deserve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2591 
May 19, 2021 
The 9/11 attacks took place during my first 
week of graduate school, and I joined the CIA 
because I wanted to help make sure nothing 
like it ever happened again—a motivation that 
was informed by a clear understanding of 
what had happened and of our own failures, 
made possible by the 9/11 Commission. 
Today, I will cast my vote in support of tak-
ing the next step that will help us understand 
this attack on our Nation—no matter how dis-
turbing or painful that truth may be. 
Its work will be vital to meeting the new se-
curity challenges we face, and to beginning to 
heal the divisions across our country. I urge 
my colleagues in the Senate to join the House 
in passing this bill and starting an honest con-
versation with the American people. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
today I rise in support of H.R. 3233, the Na-
tional Commission to Investigate the January 
6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex 
Act. 
Just four months ago, the nation stood still 
as the Capitol of the United States—the very 
beacon of our democracy—was attacked by a 
violent and armed mob of insurrectionists. 
Seeking to interrupt, even prevent, the pro-
ceedings to certify the result of the 2020 Gen-
eral Election, these insurrectionists descended 
upon our capital city inspired by the rhetoric of 
former President Donald Trump and leaders in 
the Republican party. What then transpired on 
January 6 will be recorded as one of the dark-
est days in the history of our nation and of de-
mocracies everywhere. 
The halls of the Capitol remain littered with 
remnants of the attack. Shattered glass panes, 
broken furniture, and missing statues now de-
fine the building—none of which compare to 
the trauma and fear still lingering in the minds 
of Members, aides, press, and support staff 
alike. Three officers of the U.S. Capitol Police 
Force lost their lives, and hundreds more were 
injured during the hours-long siege. 
That is why the establishment of this bipar-
tisan commission is necessary, Mr. Speaker. 
Composed of both Republicans and Demo-
crats, it would explore the events that led to 
the attack, the security failures at the Capitol 
complex, and the corrective measures nec-
essary to prevent it from ever happening 
again. Members of the commission would be 
experts in the fields of law, security, and intel-
ligence. They would be thorough in their in-
vestigation, wide in their scope, and united in 
their mission to uncover the truth. 
Those who oppose the commission as part 
of an effort to write off what happened, or to 
simply ‘‘move on,’’ clearly don’t understand 
what is at stake. The same hatred that drove 
the insurrectionists that day is still alive and 
well—even present here in this body. If we fail 
to address, review, and reflect on what hap-
pened on January 6th, I fear that this hatred 
will go unpunished, and therefore remain prev-
alent in our society and in the Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the swift passage of the 
legislation and hope for its immediate consid-
eration in the Senate. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.R. 3233, the National Commission to 
Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United 
States Capitol Complex Act. 
On January 6, 2021, our democratic repub-
lic came under direct attack in an attempt to 
block the certification of Joseph R. Biden as 
the duly elected President of the United States 
of America. Donald Trump and others sought 
to subvert the will of voters when they incited 
violent rioters to invade the U.S. Capitol with 
the hope of overturning a legitimate election. 
Criminals and domestic terrorists, many es-
pousing racist and hateful ideologies, dese-
crated the sacred center of the people’s gov-
ernment. This was terrifying and infuriating for 
those whose lives were in danger and for the 
millions of Americans who watched in horror. 
I am grateful for the actions of the U.S. Capitol 
Police and DC Metropolitan Police officers 
who put their lives on the line to protect this 
institution and the people who work here. I 
also mourn for the lives that were lost. 
Many questions remain about the actions of 
those involved and the security response that 
day, as well as in the days prior to and fol-
lowing the violent attack on the Capitol. The 
country deserves answers. This independent, 
bipartisan commission will investigate and re-
port the facts surrounding the events of Janu-
ary 6. It will provide a full and fair accounting 
of the mistakes made and lessons learned. 
And, importantly, the commission will rec-
ommend steps that Congress and the federal 
government can take to prevent future vio-
lence and strengthen our democratic institu-
tions. 
Our Nation is resilient, and the Constitution 
will endure because of the commitment of 
those who have sworn to support and defend 
it. In keeping with my oath, I look forward to 
acting on the findings of the National Commis-
sion so the country emerges stronger from this 
dark chapter of its history. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 409, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the passage of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
RAISING A QUESTION OF THE 
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to raise a question of the privileges of 
the House and send to the desk a reso-
lution (H. Res. 414) directing the At-
tending Physician to take timely ac-
tion to provide updated mask wearing 
guidance applicable to the Hall of the 
House of Representatives and com-
mittee meeting spaces for Members 
and staff who are vaccinated against 
Covid–19, consistent with the public 
guidance released by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention on May 
13, 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 414 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention issued a guidance on May 13, 
2021 stating that Americans who are fully 
vaccinated against Covid-19 no longer need 
to wear masks indoors or outdoors in almost 
all scenarios; 
Whereas the three widely available vac-
cines against Covid-19 are highly effective; 
Whereas Dr. Anthony Fauci stated on May 
16 that, ‘‘It is very unlikely that a vac-
cinated person, even if there’s a break-
through infection, would transmit it to 
someone else.’’; 
Whereas those who are fully vaccinated are 
shown not to carry the viral load necessary 
to spread the virus, and therefore do not pose 
a significant risk; 
Whereas those who have not yet received 
the vaccine pose no real threat to those who 
have been vaccinated; 
Whereas there may be Members of the 
House of Representatives whose personal 
physician, for various reasons, may rec-
ommend that they do not receive the vac-
cine; 
Whereas those who want to continue wear-
ing a mask or taking other forms of pre-
caution may do so; 
Whereas Members of the House of Rep-
resentatives have a responsibility to send a 
message to the American people that we can 
trust the safety and efficacy of the available 
Covid-19 vaccines; 
Whereas the continued House mask man-
date sends the erroneous message that the 
efficacy of the vaccines cannot be trusted; 
Whereas the continued House mask man-
date is not based on the best available 
science, is contrary to the latest CDC guid-
ance, and is not in line with the protocols in 
place in the United States Senate and at the 
White House; and 
Whereas the continued House mask man-
date hinders the ability of the House to prop-
erly and effectively conduct the people’s 
business: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Attending Physician, in 
consultation with the Director for the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, 
should take timely action to provide updated 
mask wearing guidance applicable to the 
Hall of the House of Representatives and 
committee meeting spaces for Members and 
staff who are vaccinated against Covid-19, 
consistent with the public guidance released 
by the CDC on May 13, 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Hoyer moves to lay the resolution on 
the table. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to table. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 218, nays

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN REMEM-
BRANCE 
OF 
THE 
HONORABLE 
CHARLES ELSON ‘‘BUDDY’’ ROE-
MER 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, on this somber occasion, we 
rise to honor the late Buddy Roemer. 
He was born in Shreveport, Lou-
isiana, in 1943. He was a Harvard-edu-
cated reformer with big ideas. 
He represented Louisiana’s Fourth 
Congressional District here in the 
House from 1981 to 1988. He served as 
the 52nd Governor of Louisiana, and he 
was a former candidate for President of 
the United States. 
He passed away at the age of 77 on 
May 17, 2021. 
Please join us in a moment of silence 
in honor of his public service and his 
important contributions to Louisiana 
and our Nation. 
f 
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR A 
THIRD RECONSTRUCTION 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address the injustice of poverty 
and low wealth. 
Let me just say, this pandemic has 
exposed the toll of longstanding, inter-
locking 
inequities 
stemming 
from 
structural racism, poverty, economic 
inequality, ecological devastation, and 
many more systemic barriers keeping 
people living on the edge. 
Our country now stands at a tipping 
point. Mr. Speaker, 140 million people 
are poor or one healthcare crisis, job 
loss, or emergency away from eco-
nomic desperation. We must prioritize 
their needs and give them the oppor-
tunity to live in dignity and with hope. 
We can realize the third reconstruc-
tion to fully address poverty and low 
wages from the bottom up, from hous-
ing to healthcare, water, education, 
and more. We need a third reconstruc-
tion to revive our moral and political 
commitments to democracy and the 
founding principles of this country. 
That is why Congresswoman PRAMILA 
JAYAPAL and I have worked with great 
leaders, such as Bishop William Barber 
and Dr. Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the 
Poor People’s Campaign, A National 
Call for a Moral Revival. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
cosponsor our resolution, and I want to 
thank the millions of people whose 
voices we have heard. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. DON 
HARP 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor Dr. Don Harp, 
who passed away on April 20 at the age 
of 82. 
Dr. Harp was born in Inman, Georgia, 
where he had a humble upbringing as a 
farmer. He went on to become a base-
ball star and student leader at Young 
Harris College and Huntington College. 
He was also dedicated in his pursuit of 
ministry, going on to earn a doctorate 
from the McCormick Theological Semi-
nary in Chicago. 
Dr. Harp’s accolades are impressive, 
but his greatest legacy was his gift of 
connecting with people. He could al-
ways find good in any situation and 
gave unselfishly to his alma mater and 
friends. 
As a husband, father, and grand-
father, many say that his greatest love 
was his family, and those who knew 
him best know his greatest love was 
also the Lord. 
Mr. Speaker, I had the honor and 
privilege of serving with Dr. Harp on 
the Young Harris College board of 
trustees. Don Harp loved Young Harris 
College, and Young Harris College 
loved Don Harp. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time.

FULLY ADDRESSING POVERTY 
AND LOW WAGES 
(Ms. JAYAPAL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, Ma-
hatma Gandhi, a great leader on non-
violence, said poverty is the worst form 
of violence. 
Let me be clear: We allow poverty 
when we take no action to eradicate it. 
145 million Americans today live in 
poverty in the wealthiest country in 
the world. 
We allow poverty to continue when 
we approve bloated military spending, 
when structural racism is everywhere, 
when 55 of the largest corporations did 
not even pay $1 in taxes last year, when 
32 million people do not even get paid 
$15 an hour, and 87 million Americans 
remain uninsured or underinsured. 
Poor people in this country are suf-
fering, without the food they need to 
eat, without the wages they deserve,

without the dignity they have a right 
to. 
We, in Congress, have the power to 
end poverty. We must act immediately 
with resolve, moral clarity, and with 
complete attention to the lives of poor 
people who demand to be seen and re-
spected with our actions. 
That is why I am so proud to co-in-
troduce with Representative BARBARA 
LEE this bold and necessary resolution 
that commits Congress to eradicating 
poverty from the bottom up. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we say to poor 
people everywhere, we see you, and we 
will eradicate poverty in our country 
with you.

REMEMBERING CHARLES ELSON 
‘‘BUDDY’’ ROEMER, III 
(Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in memory of Charles 
Elson ‘‘Buddy’’ Roemer, III, who was 
born October 4, 1943, and died on May 17 
of this year, a couple of days ago, went 
home to his reward. 
Buddy was a very nice guy, and he 
had a saying: ‘‘I love Louisiana, but I 
hate Louisiana politics.’’ Many of us 
can understand that remark. 
He was an American patriot, an in-
vestor, and a banker. He served in this 
body, the House of Representatives, 
from 1981–1988. He was the 52nd Gov-
ernor of Louisiana, 1988–1992. He will be 
missed, remembered, loved, and re-
spected. 
f 
RENEWING AMERICA’S FAILING 
WATER SYSTEMS 
(Mr. TONKO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, we must 
act swiftly and with boldness to renew 
America’s failing water systems. 
We know the heartache of failing 
water systems all too well: lead, PFAS, 
disruptive water main breaks, and 
unaffordable bills. 
Yesterday, I introduced bold national 
drinking 
water 
legislation, 
written 
with my friend, the chair of the Com-
mittee 
on 
Energy 
and 
Commerce, 
FRANK PALLONE, to restore America’s 
most critical infrastructure, and one of 
our most basic responsibilities of gov-
ernment, our drinking water systems. 
The AQUA Act delivers on President 
Joe Biden’s promise to remove every 
lead service line in the country, includ-
ing removing lead from the drinking 
water systems of some 400,000 schools 
and childcare centers. 
Our bill invests heavily in the Drink-
ing Water State Revolving Fund, to 
put resources in the hands of folks on 
the ground who know what their com-
munities need. 
It delivers a financial lifeline to local 
water systems in return for a multi- 
year commitment that they will not 
shut off anyone’s water because of fi-
nancial 
hardship 
during 
this 
dev-
astating and prolonged pandemic. 
Let’s rise to meet the moment. Let’s 
do our jobs. Let’s build back the right 
way so every American can use and 
trust the water coming out of our taps. 
f 
URGING 
PRESIDENT 
BIDEN 
TO 
NOMINATE AN AMBASSADOR AT 
LARGE 
FOR 
THE 
OFFICE 
OF 
INTERNATIONAL 
RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM 
(Mr. HILL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to bring attention to the rising rate of 
religious persecution around the world, 
where billions are persecuted for prac-
ticing their chosen faith. 
One of the tools we have to combat 
global religious injustice is the Office 
of International Religious Freedom at 
the State Department. However, this 
office 
remains 
without 
leadership. 
Thus far, President Biden has ne-
glected to appoint an ambassador-at- 
large for International Religious Free-
dom. 
That is why I led a bipartisan and bi-
cameral letter to President Biden to 
take action and appoint an ambas-
sador-at-large for International Reli-
gious Freedom. 
Religious freedom is one of the most 
basic human rights, Mr. Speaker, yet 
religious persecution continues around 
the world in countries like Iran, Rus-
sia, and China. 
President Biden must act now and 
nominate this ambassador and give the 
U.S. Government a leading voice to 
combat this persecution and ensure a 
future where all mankind can freely 
practice their religion of choice with-
out fear. 
f 
STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH 
ASIAN AMERICAN AND PACIFIC 
ISLANDERS 
(Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with 
my Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander brothers and sisters. 
Asian Americans continue to experi-
ence violence, harassment, and dis-
crimination. Across our country, our 
AAPI communities live in fear of being 
targets of deadly violence and racist 
slurs, simply because of who they are. 
As we work to invest and rebuild our 
communities, we must make one thing 
clear: Hate and racism have no home 
here, not in our policies, and not in our 
hearts. 
Yesterday, we passed the COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act to send to the Presi-
dent’s desk. Today, we passed a resolu-
tion condemning the horrific shooting 
in Atlanta. 
We are making progress, but we must 
never lose sight of the work that lies 
ahead to combat the hatred and vio-
lence against the AAPI community and 
root out racism against our brothers 
and sisters. 
f 
SMALL BUSINESS IS THE MAIN 
DRIVER OF NEW JOBS 
(Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, a 
while back, I visited a small business 
called Craft Axe Throwing and Beer. 
What an interesting combination of ac-
tivities, I thought. I had driven by it a 
number of times, but I stopped in one 
day. Seeing this team make a living, 
enjoying themselves, I thought to my-
self, that is what it is all about. 
Mr. Speaker, the main driver of new 
jobs in America is small business. The 
good news is that unemployment has 
been on a steady downward trend. But 
now, the hard news: the April jobs re-
port. It was bad. At the same time, 
small business owners report that they 
can’t fill the job openings that they 
have. Why? Earlier necessary govern-
ment assistance during the pandemic is 
now interfering with the successful 
transition back to meaningful work. 
A little good news: Wages are going 
up. Let’s let America run. 
f 
ENCOURAGING APPLICATIONS FOR 
UNITED STATES SERVICE ACAD-
EMIES 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to encourage young people in my 
district to learn more about the oppor-
tunities offered by our U.S. service 
academies. 
One of the greatest honors of being a 
Member of Congress is having the abil-
ity to nominate outstanding students 
for appointment to West Point, the 
Naval Academy, the Air Force Acad-
emy, and the Merchant Marine Acad-
emy. 
As high school students contemplate 
what they will do after graduation, I 
encourage them to consider the bene-
fits of attending one of our service 
academies, including the unique oppor-
tunities for leadership and entry to a 
range of careers, at no cost to the stu-
dent or their family. 
The process is competitive, so it is 
never too early to get started. 
I encourage any students in Penn-
sylvania’s Fifth Congressional District 
who might be interested in attending a 
service academy to attend our next 
virtual information session hosted by 
my office on May 27 at 7 p.m. They 
may sign up at scanlon.house.gov. 
I look forward to nominating another 
amazing group of young leaders to the 
service academies this fall.

ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO 
DEFEND ITSELF 
(Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, for 10 days, moms, dads, and 
grandparents have been lying awake at 
night, waiting for the inevitable warn-
ing call of sirens to pick up their chil-
dren and run to the nearest bomb shel-
ter. 
No one should live with this type of 
fear. No one should live with the fear 
that missiles could rain down and de-
stroy their homes and lives at any mo-
ment. Yet, this is the reality that 
many Israeli families are living right 
now. 
For 10 days, Israel has been defending 
itself from attacks launched by Ira-
nian-backed terrorists. Let’s be clear: 
Israel has the right to defend herself 
and its homeland from terrorist at-
tacks. 
Israel is one of the United States’ 
greatest allies in the Middle East, and 
we cannot waver in our support of 
Israel during this challenging time. 
Today, I am standing with the people 
of Israel, and I urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
My hope is that peace and calm can 
quickly be restored in the region. Until 
that happens, we must continue stand-
ing in solidarity with the Nation of 
Israel and its people. 
f 
ATTACK ON JEWISH PEOPLE IN 
LOS ANGELES 
(Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, over 
the last 5 years, we have seen a 40 per-
cent increase in anti-Semitic hate 
crimes. Most are lone wolf property 
crimes, late at night. 
But last night in Los Angeles, we saw 
something new: organized violence. A 
small caravan of SUVs, waving Pales-
tinian flags, drove to a significantly 
Jewish neighborhood. Dozens of men, 
wearing all black, with faces covered, 
disembarked at a restaurant, chanting 
‘‘death to the Jews.’’ They demanded 
that diners either answer the question: 
‘‘Are you Jewish?’’ And if they an-
swered ‘‘yes’’ or they objected to the 
question, they were beaten, some sent 
to the hospital. 
Nearby, an Orthodox Jew, dressed 
distinctively, was chased down by a 
caravan waving Palestinian flags. He 
ran for his life, and thank God, he 
found safety. 
The Los Angeles Police Department 
will investigate these hate crimes. I 
also ask that those who criticize the 
Israeli Government to avoid rhetoric 
which will infuse these anti-Semites 
with the view that they are somehow 
part of the American mainstream. 
ONGOING TERRORIST ATTACKS 
AGAINST THE STATE OF ISRAEL 
(Mr. JACKSON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to express support for one of our 
most loyal allies, Israel. 
Unlike many of my colleagues across 
the aisle, I will not waver in my sup-
port for democracy, and I will not turn 
a blind eye to the ongoing terrorist at-
tacks against the State of Israel. 
The simple fact is, Israel uses weap-
ons to protect its citizens from ter-
rorism, and Hamas uses its weapons 
with the goal of murdering civilians 
and annihilating the State of Israel as 
a whole. 
There is no moral equivalence be-
tween the two, and any attempt to 
make Israel out as the aggressor is not 
rooted in fact. Israel has the right to 
defend itself as a sovereign country. 
In 2014, Congress unanimously passed 
a Democrat-led resolution condemning 
Hamas attacks on Israel after they had 
launched approximately 300 rockets. 
This time, Hamas has launched over 
4,000 rockets into Israel in just 10 days, 
yet, it is not clear to me that Demo-
crats in this House would support a 
similar resolution today. 
That is a sad and problematic shift. 
Congress must continue its support 
for U.S. aid to Israel, and Congress 
must confront terrorists and their 
backers, like Iran. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, ac-
cording to recent data from my dis-
trict, the number one concern of my 
constituents is the Biden border crisis. 
Let me repeat that: The number one 
concern of my constituents in North 
Carolina is the crisis at our southern 
border, over 1,600-miles away. 
It is beyond clear that the response 
by the Biden administration has not 
simply been weak; it has also been 
counterproductive. Americans nation-
wide are sensing what the inter-
national community has known for the 
past 6 months: Our leaders are not 
strong, our border is open, and America 
is ripe for the taking. 
Fifteen hundred illegal immigrants 
cross into our country daily without 
ever being tracked, according to border 
data. Two Yemeni men on a terror 
watchlist were just apprehended at the 
border, and this administration has 
turned a blind eye to one of our biggest 
national security crises in recent his-
tory. 
Mr. Speaker, I am disappointed, be-
cause it seems that the political ma-
neuvering of one select class has co- 
opted the good of the people. What can 
we, as individual Americans, do in the 
face of such abject disregard for our 
well-being? We can speak out. 
b 1915 
PROMISING ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to highlight Oklahoma’s 
efforts to bolster its economy and get 
its citizens back to work. 
There is no doubt the pandemic 
caused not only illness, but major 
interruption in our daily lives. Millions 
became jobless through no fault of 
their own and had to rely on additional 
Federal unemployment assistance to 
survive. 
But today the situation has changed, 
Mr. Speaker. We have a rebounding 
economy and over 158 million Ameri-
cans have received at least one vaccine 
dose. With more than 8 million job 
openings nationwide, the time has 
come to encourage Americans to get 
back to work. 
The continued expansion of Federal 
assistance is hampering this promising 
economic recovery across the country 
and in my home State of Oklahoma. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say Okla-
homa is leading the country’s eco-
nomic recovery by providing $1,200 
signing bonuses beginning in June, for 
individuals who go back to work and 
stay 
employed 
for 
six 
continuous 
weeks. There are over 68,000 job post-
ings in Oklahoma currently, with 7,500 
in Oklahoma City alone. These are 
good-paying jobs across a variety of in-
dustries, including the energy and 
manufacturing sectors. Hundreds of 
employers 
are 
offering 
competitive 
wages and generous benefits. 
f 
ANTI-SEMITISM ON THE RISE 
(Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a very sad time in America. As was dis-
cussed earlier today in debate, we used 
to 
have 
bipartisan 
agreements 
on 
things. One of those was when anti- 
Semitism was raising its ugly head. 
One party here on the floor still speaks 
up against, will vote against anti-Se-
mitic statements and call them out for 
what they are, and another will not. 
I heard my friend across the aisle, 
BRAD SHERMAN, just appropriately de-
crying the violence, these anti-Jewish 
folks in California, this incident. Well, 
that surely could be something we 
could once again, come back together 
in a bipartisan way and condemn the 40 
percent rise in violence against Se-
mitic people. It is time to come to-
gether on that. It will show the world.

May 19, 2021 
thoughts. First of all, we are stronger 
as a country when we stand up against 
hate at all times. 
Today, in the Judiciary Committee, 
we saw the results of hate now 100 
years in the making, and that is the 
Tulsa race riots. The Tulsa race riots 
showed that attackers looted and in-
tentionally burned an estimated 1,256 
homes in Greenwood, America’s Black 
Wall Street, along with nearly all of 
the district’s churches, schools, and 
businesses. 
The testimony of yesteryear saw 
hundreds of men march through the 
main business section of White town 
with their hats off and their hands up. 
The brutality was unmentionable. Men, 
women, and children, driven like cat-
tle, huddled like horses, treated like 
beasts. 
Today, we heard from Viola Fletcher, 
107 years old; Hughes van Ellis, 100 
years old; and Lessie Benningfield 
Randle, 106 years old. We ask for jus-
tice for them. 
In addition, I want to take note that 
this is Asian American and Pacific Is-
lander Heritage Month, and to be able 
to say that we stand against the hor-
rific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on 
March 16, 2021. We have to stand 
against hate. I am glad that we passed 
the bipartisan commission on January 
6 to show that America is unified. 
Finally, some good news to my con-
stituents: We will be launching the 
child tax credit effort. We want you to 
get that child tax credit. 
f 
THREE MAJOR CRISES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. JOHNSON) is recognized for 
60 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members have 5 legislative days to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
include extraneous material on the 
subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Louisiana? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, during my time tonight, my 
colleagues and I will address three 
major crises happening here at home, 
happening close to home at our south-
ern border; and happening to our clos-
est ally in the Middle East, and that is 
Israel. 
Each of these issues that my col-
leagues will discuss tonight can and 
should be addressed in a bipartisan 
way. We should all want Americans to 
get back to work. We should all want 
to end the humanitarian crisis at our 
border, and we should all want to sup-
port one of our closest allies from ter-
rorism. 
It is time for President Biden and our 
Democrat colleagues to work with Re-
publicans to solve these problems for 
the American people and for our allies. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Tennessee’s Sixth District (Mr. 
ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to express my steadfast support for the 
nation of Israel, our closest and great-
est ally in the Middle East. 
Hamas, a designated terrorist organi-
zation, has been targeting civilians by 
firing thousands of rockets on Israeli 
cities. These attacks are both tragic 
and unacceptable, and Israel undeni-
ably has the right to continue to de-
fend itself. 
As Hamas continues these attacks, 
the United States must show its un-
wavering support for Israel, condemn 
this aggression by Hamas, and sanction 
those who fund terrorism, such as Iran. 
That is why I am a cosponsor of the 
Palestinian 
International 
Terrorism 
Support Prevention Act introduced by 
Representative BRIAN MAST. America 
does not tolerate those who fund ter-
rorists, and this legislation would put 
in place sanctions on governments and 
individuals that do. 
The nation of Israel is the only de-
mocracy in the Middle East, and the 
relationship we share is indispensable. 
With the world watching, we must send 
a clear message to Hamas, Islamic 
jihadists, and those that fund them 
that the United States stands with 
Israel. 
I unequivocally support our friend, 
Israel, and recognize its right to self- 
defense in the face of these horrific as-
saults by Hamas. I pray for peace in Je-
rusalem and for the safety of all 
Israelis. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
those remarks on Israel. We do stand 
strong with them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from Arkansas’ Second District 
(Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my friend from Louisiana for bringing 
our Members to the floor tonight to 
talk about something that is so essen-
tial to American life, our careers, our 
work, our independence, our ability to 
pursue happiness. 
This pandemic has thrown many off 
track for that, and it is House Repub-
licans that want to make sure we pur-
sue policies that get people back to 
work, back to opportunity, back to 
independence. 
Our small businesses in my home 
State of Arkansas and local economies 
across our country are recovering from 
the devastation of the pandemic. They 
now face a threat that has resulted 
from President Biden and House Demo-
crats’ inflated and fiscally irrespon-
sible approach to unemployment bene-
fits. 
The Wall Street Journal reports 
there are over 8 million job openings, 
Mr. Speaker, in the United States right 
now. That is almost more jobs open 
than every person currently out of 
work. 
Instead of encouraging these posi-
tions to be filled, my friends on the 
other 
side 
of 
the 
aisle 
have 
disincentivized going back to work and 
have made these benefits so appealing 
that it has disrupted labor markets 
across the country, particularly in Ar-
kansas, 
particularly 
lower-income 
labor markets. 
Medical workers, small businesses, 
and restaurants all tell me that this is 
creating problems for them. It has hurt 
States so much that a handful of indi-
vidual States are now rejecting partici-
pating in Federal unemployment bene-
fits. 
This is not the direction we need to 
go, and it does not take an economist 
to understand this is not a permanent 
solution. We cannot keep tying policies 
back to a once-in-a-century pandemic 
that will systematically change our 
country forever. 
The solution is simple, and it is what 
House Republicans are advocating and 
have been advocating for months. We 
need policies that encourage Ameri-
cans to get back to work, not policies 
that encourage reliance on the Federal 
Government. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield next to the gentle-
woman from Illinois’ 15th District 
(Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Congressman JOHNSON for 
hosting this Special Order on so many 
important issues that our country is 
facing. 
I stand for peace, and a lasting one. 
Side by side, the American and Israeli 
people have stood for freedom and de-
mocracy in the face of authoritarian 
aggression. Side by side, the American 
and Israeli people have stood for jus-
tice with restraint in the face of reck-
less violence. Side by side, the Amer-
ican and Israeli people have stood for 
peace through self-defense in the face 
of terrorism. 
President Trump was working with 
various Islamic nation-states in the 
Middle East to adopt the Abraham Ac-
cords in order to foster better diplo-
matic relations with the nation of 
Israel. Unfortunately, Joe Biden has 
brought 
this 
peace 
process 
to 
a 
screeching halt. 
We know Hamas is a terrorist organi-
zation, and they are funded by Iran. 
The Biden administration continues to 
negotiate with Iran to get them back 
in the Iran deal. Iran is a funder of ter-
rorists, and the Iran deal would make 
it easier for them to commit and fund 
terror. Iran has provided money to 
Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist 
organizations. These groups’ intention 
is to destroy Israel and the Jewish 
state. 
The ongoing rocket attacks against 
Israeli civilians show why America 
must 
act 
immediately 
to 
support 
Israel, condemn Hamas, and sanction 
those who fund terrorism. 
My family and I will continue to pray 
for the peace and safety and for the 
people of Israel as they combat ter-
rorism.

H2597 
May 19, 2021 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, we are admonished even by 
Scripture to pray for the peace of 
Israel, and we will. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Minnesota’s Seventh Dis-
trict (Mrs. FISCHBACH). 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Louisiana for 
organizing 
the 
Special 
Order 
this 
evening. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in soli-
darity with the State of Israel. As the 
only democracy in the Middle East, 
Israel is among our greatest allies and 
friends. 
Since the beginning, Israel has had 
two goals: to live as a Jewish state and 
to do so in peace. 
This was true at its founding, and it 
remains true today. 
But just as it has been throughout 
history, Israel again finds itself under 
attack, this time by Hamas terrorists, 
who, with the help of Iran, are bent on 
destroying the only Jewish state in the 
world. 
Does Israel not have a right to defend 
itself? 
Make no mistake, Hamas is not in-
terested in peace. They want to destroy 
Israel and its people, and are willing to 
use women, children, and journalists as 
human shields to do so. 
Some, including Members of this 
body, have taken to propaganda to 
paint Israel as the aggressor, but that 
is 
nothing 
more 
than 
cheap 
gaslighting. Israel is not now, nor have 
they ever been, an aggressor state. Its 
only actions have been in its own de-
fense. 
There is simply no moral equivalence 
between a nation defending itself and 
those who would use terrorism to anni-
hilate the Jewish people. In fact, de-
feating this terrorism is a prerequisite 
for peace. 
Mr. Speaker, these ongoing attacks 
are exactly why the United States 
must stand with our Israeli allies, con-
demn Hamas terrorists, and sanction 
those who provide them support. I call 
on all Members of this distinguished 
body to continue our long history of 
support for our Israeli allies. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. NEHLS), a former sheriff. 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, it is time 
to get Americans back to work. The 
vaccine is available for all. Cases are 
down across the country. Businesses 
have openings they need to fill. 
Using COVID as an excuse to stay 
home and collect unemployment insur-
ance is not healthy for our economy or 
workers. We should be encouraging 
folks to take control of their lives and 
get back to work, but the multitril-
lion-dollar proposals out of the Biden 
administration 
and 
the 
continued 
COVID Federal unemployment insur-
ance payments of $300 per week are en-
couraging folks to stay home. 
We just saw the Democrats and the 
Biden administration deliver 266,000 
new jobs in the month of May, when 
the Dow Jones predicted 1 million jobs 
would be added. 
b 1930 
Why this incredible underachieve-
ment? Because the policies of the 
Democrats and the Biden administra-
tion are failing our economy, failing 
our business owners, and failing the 
American people. 
Gas prices are skyrocketing across 
the country. The per-pound cost of cop-
per is more than double what it was 
just 12 months ago. And the price of 
homes is rising. The annual inflation 
rate is triple what it was in 2020 and 
the highest it has been in over a dec-
ade. 
These are the consequences of spend-
ing trillions of dollars on COVID relief 
and continuing to pay people not to 
work. The swamp continues to waste 
taxpayer dollars on failed policies they 
say we can fix by continuing to spend 
trillions more. When is enough enough? 
When are we going to let the free mar-
ket flourish? 
That is the path back to our historic 
economy pre-COVID. The sooner we de-
cide to get back to lower taxes, less 
regulation, and more economic free-
dom, the quicker we can get the Amer-
ican people back to work and the econ-
omy back to health. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Florida’s 26th District (Mr. GIMENEZ). 
Mr. GIMENEZ. Mr. Speaker, one 
thing has been made absolutely clear 
in last’s month abysmal jobs report: 
More 
government 
spending, 
bigger 
mandates 
and 
regulations, 
incentivizing people to stay on unem-
ployment, and punishing States that 
encourage small mom and pops to re-
open is not the way to Build Back Bet-
ter. It is time for us to pursue policies 
that put Americans back to work. 
All the so-called experts and eco-
nomic forecasters wanted to believe so 
hard that the massive $1.9 trillion 
spending package that the Speaker and 
President Biden rammed through Con-
gress was going to be the answer. But 
the truth always prevails. That is why, 
for the first time in Congress, Demo-
crats actually joined Republicans on a 
major piece of legislation in voting 
against that sham of a bill. But it 
passed anyway. 
When Republicans stood up on this 
floor to explain line item by line item 
what was wrong with that bill and why 
this was the wrong approach, we got 
attacked by our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle for everything 
imaginable. But once again, we were 
proven right. The Speaker and Presi-
dent Biden were proven wrong. 
Now, they are wanting to do this all 
over again with infrastructure. The 
current infrastructure proposal being 
put forward not only adds trillions of 
dollars in spending on top of the $1.9 
trillion Congress has already approved 
to be spent in the previous spending 
spree, but now the solution is paying 
for it by raising taxes. Once again, the 
American people are being lied to 
about who is actually going to be af-
fected by those tax hikes. 
The spinmasters are trying to paint a 
picture that equates the big evil word 
‘‘corporation’’ as big-box players and 
tech 
behemoths 
such 
as 
Amazon, 
Netflix, and Facebook. But here is the 
truth, the term ‘‘corporation’’ is really 
only a tax designation for a business 
entity. Corporations include your local 
mom-and-pop restaurant. It includes 
the local corner street pharmacy. It in-
cludes the farms that supply the local 
farmers markets. It is the local fisher-
men, the family-run dance studio, the 
store that sells football uniforms to 
the local high school team, the music 
instructor helping prepare kids for the 
next concert, and the guy who scraped 
together his earnings and started a 
plumbing business. 
While the progressive left wants to 
take swipes at major billionaire com-
panies through extreme taxation, they 
are bringing all of us along with them. 
We are all going to be paying more. 
At a time when our economy has con-
tinued to rebound from the COVID–19 
pandemic, we should be encouraging 
small businesses to reopen, rehire 
workers, and spur our local economies, 
not punishing them with more taxes 
and more regulations. 
America’s small businesses and our 
middle-class workers deserve much 
better than this. I know we can and 
will do better if my colleagues across 
the aisle choose to work with us in ear-
nest. 
Let’s 
stop 
this 
political 
grandstanding for the majority and get 
to work. 
Republicans are waiting, and we are 
willing. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, there are three major crises 
we are talking about again tonight: the 
economic crisis here at home, the cri-
sis happening close to home at our 
southern border, and what is happening 
to our closest ally in the Middle East, 
Israel. 
I yield to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania’s 12th District (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Louisiana for 
yielding. 
The current economic crisis facing 
our Nation is troubling but not sur-
prising. Skyrocketing inflation, rising 
gas prices, and growing unemployment 
are the results of a White House that 
fundamentally believes more govern-
ment is the solution. 
To be clear, President Biden’s mas-
sive tax-and-spend policies constitute a 
losing formula, which will drag our Na-
tion deeper into debt and government 
dependency. The April jobs report is a 
testament to this. 
A record 8 million jobs are available. 
However, only 266,000 were filled last 
month because Biden is promoting gov-
ernment control rather than the sus-
tainable income of a job. 
Job creators across Pennsylvania, in 
the 
hospitality, 
energy, 
manufac-
turing, agriculture, and many other in-
dustries, say the same thing: They are 
struggling to find workers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2598 
May 19, 2021 
Biden’s policies are detrimental to 
our economic recovery and are the last 
thing America needs. Even more frus-
trating, the solution to get us back on 
track has been present all along: re-
open the economy, stop piling debt on 
our children, and get Americans back 
to work. 
It is time that President Biden recog-
nizes that Big Government is the prob-
lem, and only the ingenuity and resil-
ience of the American people will lead 
us to prosperity. 
Now more than ever, our government 
needs to get out of the way and allow 
Americans to reclaim control of their 
lives and their government. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Georgia’s 12th District (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. JOHNSON for yielding and for hold-
ing this Special Order this evening. 
Thanks to the success of Operation 
Warp Speed, we have been able to get 
millions of Americans vaccinated. 
Georgia 
has 
led 
the 
Nation 
in 
COVID–19 economic recovery, and I am 
proud to say that Georgia’s economy 
has reached prepandemic levels. 
Now that the CDC has rolled back 
mask recommendations, we are finally 
seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. 
But there is a lot of work to be done 
to get this great American economy, 
the greatest economy in the world, 
growing 
again. 
Unfortunately, 
the 
Biden administration is asleep at the 
wheel when it comes to what needs to 
be done to spur economic growth. 
As of March, U.S. job-makers re-
ported 8.1 million available jobs, a 
record high. But I am hearing from 
small businesses that they can’t get 
their employees to go back to work. 
That is because President Biden and 
congressional Democrats are paying 
people more money to stay home than 
to go to work. 
I am grateful that, starting next 
month, our Governor, Governor Kemp, 
is ending the extra $300 in Federal 
weekly jobless payments. It is time for 
all States to opt out of this Federal job 
supplement 
and 
quit 
wasting 
tax-
payers’ money. 
Let’s get Americans back to work 
and focus on rebuilding our economy. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN), who knows 
quite a bit about handling a crisis. He 
is the highest-ranking military officer 
ever elected to the United States Con-
gress and also my friend. 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, the 
gentleman is not only my friend and 
colleague but also not well enough ac-
knowledged as the largely singular au-
thor of the Commitment to Civility by 
the bipartisan freshman classes in 2017. 
That document, unfortunately, is too 
well hidden. I thank you again for all 
the work you did because you laid it 
out, and it is more applicable today 
than it was back 41⁄2 years ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my 
support for getting America back to 
work. That support, if I spoke as loud 
as the support that I gave, you would 
probably have to tone down the micro-
phone system. 
As we look toward the future and to 
getting our economy back on track, I 
am increasingly concerned with the 
Federal Government’s indiscriminate, 
uncalculated interference. 
In April, we saw the unemployment 
rate increase to 6.1 percent at a time 
when you have more ‘‘help wanted’’ 
signs out than you can imagine. Frank-
ly, as I drive across my district in the 
beautiful part of northern Michigan 
where summer has just now thought 
about arriving, and I see all those 
‘‘help wanted’’ signs hanging in the 
windows of countless small businesses. 
That number, unfortunately, comes as 
no surprise, given the current adminis-
tration’s policies. 
We in Congress should be thoroughly 
angered that with so many businesses 
looking for help, we instead advance 
policies that encourage people to stay 
unemployed. 
The expanded unemployment bene-
fits served a positive and caring pur-
pose when businesses were being forced 
to close in response to the pandemic a 
year ago. However, as more Americans 
get vaccinated, and we return to a 
more normal life, the need is not the 
same as it was in March 2020. 
Instead, the extra $300 a week Presi-
dent Biden and the Democrats gave in 
their latest relief bill to those who stay 
unemployed does little but distort the 
job market, disrupt our supply chains, 
and encourage many to simply stay 
home instead of finding a job. 
Meanwhile, the backbone of our econ-
omy, small businesses across the coun-
try, are struggling to find enough 
workers, despite offering competitive 
wages, benefits, and, in many cases, 
hiring bonuses. 
To start addressing this problem, 
States like Michigan should imme-
diately end their participation in the 
enhanced supplemental unemployment 
program. 
The only way for us as a country to 
fully recover from this pandemic is by 
having the Federal Government stop 
sabotaging our economy and instead 
encourage Americans to get back to 
work. 
The dignity of work, of a job well 
done, cannot be underestimated when 
it comes to bolstering our citizens with 
a sense of faith in the future and faith 
in our country. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Tennessee’s 
Eighth 
District 
(Mr. 
KUSTOFF). 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I would 
like to recognize my friend and col-
league from Louisiana (Mr. JOHNSON), a 
great leader. I thank him for orga-
nizing this evening. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to address two 
different fronts of President Biden’s 
policies, both of which are failing the 
American people. 
The April jobs report showed that the 
economy added less than 270,000 new 
jobs. That is disappointing, and it was 
an underperformance from the 1 mil-
lion jobs that economists expected. 
It really should be no surprise to 
anyone because the enhanced unem-
ployment benefits that were approved 
by Congress, against all of our objec-
tions, under President Biden’s initia-
tive have truly disincentivized people 
from going back to work. 
Then, on the second front, we have 
seen over the past week or so Hamas 
continue to launch thousands of rock-
ets at Israel, aiming to kill as many in-
nocent lives as possible. 
Let me be clear: I strongly condemn 
these attacks. Everybody on this side 
of the aisle strongly condemns those 
attacks. We fully support Israel’s un-
equivocal right to defend herself and 
her citizens. 
Yet, President Biden has taken a 
weak approach, demonstrating to ter-
rorist organizations that his adminis-
tration won’t stand up for one of our 
greatest nations, greatest friends, and 
greatest allies, and that is Israel. 
America’s support of our strongest 
ally in the Middle East, it should never 
be quiet. That sends a terrible message 
to the rest of the world. 
Ultimately, we need a government 
that is more efficient, more effective, 
and accountable. 
We need to get people back to work. 
We must reopen our economy, lower 
taxes, and get our children back in 
school. 
Lastly, we have to show the rest of 
the world that our support for Israel 
will never waver, that we stand strong 
in defending the Jewish state together 
as one. 
You know, Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu once said, and I will para-
phrase: If Arabs put down their weap-
ons today, there would be no more vio-
lence. If the Jews put down their weap-
ons today, there would be no Israel. I 
think that pretty much sums it up. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, that does sum it up. It is a 
very real crisis we face. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas’ First District (Mr. GOH-
MERT). 
b 1945 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, here is 
an article by Tristan Justice: ‘‘April 
job numbers are so bad, CNBC thought 
it was a typo.’’ 
Another article: ‘‘New stimulus pack-
age: Unemployment benefits, $300 per 
week extended till September.’’ 
‘‘America’s Vanishing Workforce,’’ 
article by Megan Cassella and Rebecca 
Rainey. 
And this one, The Hill: ‘‘It is time for 
States to take the lead in getting 
Americans back to work,’’ by Anthony 
Hughes. 
Why is that? It is because we have an 
administration that is doing every-
thing it can in conjunction with the 
Democrats in Congress to keep people 
from going back to work.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2599 
May 19, 2021 
Now, when I was between my sopho-
more and junior year at Texas A&M, I 
was accepted on an exchange program 
for the summer to the Soviet Union. 
And at one point, being out at a collec-
tive farm many miles outside of Kiev, I 
couldn’t tell what was cultivated and 
what wasn’t. It looked brown. It didn’t 
look good. But all the farmers in the 
middle of the morning—10, 10:30—they 
are sitting out under a tree in the 
shade, and they are visiting. 
And I tried to have a smile and use 
my best Russian. And I asked, ‘‘When 
do you work out in the field?’’ Because 
I had stood there for a while. And they 
all laughed, and I thought maybe I 
didn’t say it right in Russian. 
And finally one of them said, ‘‘I 
make the same number of rubles if I 
am out there in the sun as I do in the 
shade, so I stay in the shade.’’ 
I got a message from one of my 
friends, a lady, that says her yard guy 
says he can’t get people to come back 
to work. He has got 125 yards. And her 
hairdresser’s kids, they are not work-
ing, all because of this big bonus if you 
don’t work. It is time to get people 
back to work, having them earn their 
money. America will be better for it. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. STEFANIK), 
our newly elected conference chair-
woman. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans across this country are facing cri-
sis after crisis. 
Just think, just over a year ago, in 
early 2020, our economy was booming, 
our standing in the world was strong, 
we had just rebuilt our Nation’s mili-
tary, and our communities and families 
were thriving. 
Here we are, a little over one year 
later, in just over 100 days, President 
Biden and Speaker PELOSI have dis-
mantled 
that 
foundation, 
and 
the 
American people are paying the price. 
Americans are suffering under four 
crises from the far-left radical socialist 
policies of President Biden and Speak-
er PELOSI. 
First, American families are facing 
an economic crisis, fueled by trillions 
of dollars in uncontrolled spending, 
rampant inflation, and unemployment 
benefits that incentivize workers to 
stay home while businesses are des-
perate to hire employees. 
We just experienced one of the worst 
jobs reports in over 20 years, with un-
employment rising, cost of living in-
creasing every single day, and small 
businesses unable to hire. This impacts 
every hardworking American family, 
and it is a crisis with no end in sight, 
except the trillions and trillions of dol-
lars in new taxes proposed by President 
Biden and Speaker PELOSI. 
Second, American families are facing 
an energy crisis. This is the first time 
my generation is experiencing wide-
spread gas lines and stations with no 
gas. If we do find gas, Americans are 
paying more at the pump than they 
have in 7 years. This is unacceptable, 
and it is unaffordable for every Amer-
ican family. 
Third, President Biden and Speaker 
PELOSI have single-handedly created a 
historic border crisis leading to ramp-
ant human trafficking, an influx of 
criminals and dangerous drugs, like 
fentanyl, rushing across the border. 
And make no mistake, this does not 
just affect our border States along the 
southern border, every State in this 
country is a border State and every 
city is a border city experiencing the 
consequences of this border crisis. 
Fourth, the world is watching in hor-
ror as we are facing a national security 
crisis in the Middle East and a resur-
gent Russia and China. Israel is under 
attack by Iranian-backed terrorists, 
and our radical socialist Democrat col-
leagues across the aisle cannot decide 
whose side they are on. 
Let me be clear, my colleagues, the 
Republicans, we stand with Israel. 
More importantly, the American peo-
ple stand with Israel. And these four 
crises are impacting every American 
family across this Nation. In my dis-
trict, in New York’s 21st District, 
small businesses have more ‘‘Help 
Wanted’’ signs than they have workers. 
Restaurants, like Ted’s Fish Fry in Up-
state New York, have been forced to 
close one day a week, just as we are 
heading into summer, because they are 
unable to hire workers. 
Families are bearing the brunt of the 
abrupt 
tax 
hikes 
caused 
by 
sky-
rocketing gas prices. Border patrol 
agents that should be securing our 
northern border have been sent to the 
southern border, leaving hundreds of 
miles of border in my district exposed 
to drug traffickers and criminals. 
And people are struggling to grasp 
the unthinkable. How is the Biden ad-
ministration negotiating with Iran, the 
world’s largest state sponsor of terror, 
who has targeted our friends, neigh-
bors, and the soldiers of the 10th Moun-
tain Division in my home district. 
Republicans and the American people 
are united in rallying against the de-
structive, radical far-left policies of 
Biden and Pelosi, causing crisis after 
crisis in our country every day. 
We will continue to stand strongly 
with American workers, American fam-
ilies, small businesses, as well as our 
allies around the world. And we will 
fight back against these policies that 
have led to the devastation and de-
struction across this country. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank our conference chair 
from the great State of New York, and 
we will go across the country to the 
other coast to the State of California, 
the 25th District represented by Mr. 
GARCI´A. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in direct support 
of our most critical ally, Israel. 
Rarely in history has the strategic 
alliance between two nations been 
more meaningful and necessary to the 
pursuit of worldwide stability than the 
modern 
partnership 
between 
the 
United States and Israel. 
I believe the recipe for a lasting rela-
tionship between our two nations and 
achieving stability in the region in 
pursuit of peace, is comprised of the 
following key tenets. 
Number one, maximum foreign mili-
tary funds from the U.S. to Israel with 
a focus on providing Israel a quali-
tative military edge. 
Number two, an undivided Jerusalem 
as the capital of Israel. 
Number three, the Golan Heights 
must remain under the control of 
Israel. 
Number four, the worldwide elimi-
nation of boycott divestment and sanc-
tions against Israel and Jewish com-
munities here in the U.S. Such prac-
tices are blatantly anti-Semitic. 
Number five, prosecution of and de-
fense against mutual threats to Israel 
in the United States. Any threats to 
Israel should be treated as a threat to 
the United States. 
Number six, we cannot allow a nu-
clear-capable Iran, and we should not 
reenter the JCPOA nuclear deal. 
Mr. Speaker, I have seen war first-
hand. War is an ugly thing, but failing 
to unequivocally support an ally as 
critical as Israel in pursuit of world-
wide stability is the ugliest of things, 
especially at a time like this when sta-
bility worldwide is eroding in front of 
us. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress and this 
administration to fully support Israel. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Cali-
fornia, and I move to the great State of 
Texas next, the 36th District. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. BABIN). 
Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend from Louisiana (Mr. JOHN-
SON). 
Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor 
today with one clear message for the 
American people: Bad policies have bad 
consequences. 
Not that many weeks ago, we had a 
thriving and stable economy. We were 
energy-independent. We were a sov-
ereign Nation with a secure border. 
Now, roughly 100 days into Joe Biden’s 
presidency, we are living in what feels 
like the twilight zone with gas short-
ages, 2008 levels of inflation, rampant 
and out-of-control spending, high un-
employment rates, destruction in the 
Middle East, political correctness and 
wokeness, winning the war on common 
sense, and worst of all, a massive bor-
der crisis. 
These things didn’t just happen, 
folks. They are the direct result of the 
left’s conscious policy decisions—or 
rather delusions. Is this the America 
they really wanted? 
Unfortunately, 
the 
mainstream 
media wants to distract you from the 
colossal failures of America’s weakest 
President and his administration. In 
fact, the liberal media dedicated ap-
proximately zero minutes of airtime to

the April illegal border crossing num-
bers, which were the worst in our Na-
tion’s history. 
But I am here to tell you the truth. 
Biden’s foolhardy policies have created 
a disaster on America’s southern bor-
der. He has failed us. He has failed you 
and your family. And most impor-
tantly, he has failed to maintain the 
sovereignty of our beloved Nation. 
We cannot begin to comprehend the 
lasting impact that Biden’s border cri-
sis will have on the sanctity and secu-
rity of this Nation. And as I wade 
through the anarchic waters of living 
in Joe Biden and the Democrat’s Amer-
ica, I am reminded of the words of 
Alexander the Great, when he said, ‘‘I 
am not afraid of an army of lions led 
by a sheep; I am afraid of an army of 
sheep led by a lion.’’ 
My friends, leadership is everything. 
And sadly, right now, our country is in 
desperate need of a real leader. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for that 
great reminder. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE), my friend 
from Georgia’s 8th District. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding his time. 
Mr. Speaker, we are all seeing gas 
prices soar—35 percent since January, 
since this administration took office. 
Whereas, what this administration in-
herited, under President Trump, was 
low and affordable energy costs and our 
Nation had actually achieved energy 
independence. There was record low un-
employment numbers across all demo-
graphics. And prior to COVID, the av-
erage hourly wage earnings rose at the 
fastest rate in decades. 
So what has changed? Well, what has 
changed is a reversal of those policies 
that work. Unfortunately, President 
Biden has proved that he is far more 
concerned with appeasing the fringe 
left-wing environmental extremists in 
his party than he is in helping the av-
erage American by lowering energy 
costs and creating good-paying jobs. 
So with prices continuing to soar and 
massive labor shortages, it only makes 
sense that we should be doing the right 
kinds of things to get people back to 
work. And make no mistake, Biden’s 
reckless energy policies have con-
sequences. 
I know I hear all the time from vet-
erans in my district who literally are 
having to make the choice between 
driving 45-plus miles to a veteran’s 
clinic or trying to have enough money 
to survive. 
However, on day one, President Biden 
celebrated the canceling of the Key-
stone Pipeline and eliminated tens of 
thousands of jobs and millions of dol-
lars for our economy. And yet, yester-
day, the Biden administration gave the 
green light to finishing Russia’s pipe-
line going down to Germany. 
This is the height of hypocrisy. Are 
you kidding me? That we are not going 
to allow our own country to have a 
pipeline, but we are going to approve it 
for Russia? That pipeline with Russia 
is literally going to give billions of rev-
enue to the Putin regime, and the com-
pletion thereof is going to cause our al-
lies in Europe to have to rely more 
heavily on Russian oil. We are the ones 
who ought to be selling American oil to 
Europe, not enabling their reliance 
upon the Kremlin. 
Under President Trump, we had a 
policy where America was first. It ap-
pears under this current administra-
tion that America is last. And I will 
just repeat this: This is what we have: 
Under President Biden, sanctions 
against Russia are canceled and they 
build 
a 
pipeline. 
Under 
President 
Biden, he cripples our own economy by 
canceling Keystone. 
It is time for us to get back to work. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, may I inquire how much time 
I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 201⁄2 minutes remaining. 
b 2000 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Louisiana for his leadership to-
night and for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today because it 
is time to get Americans back to work. 
At the beginning of the pandemic, in-
dustries of all types were desperately 
trying to keep their doors open and 
thousands of Americans lost their jobs. 
Since then, Congress has passed meas-
ures aimed to aid individuals and busi-
nesses, including five bipartisan relief 
bills, which I supported. 
Today, we are starting to return to 
normal. Businesses across the country 
are opening their doors to pre-COVID 
operation levels. However, these indus-
tries are facing a new challenge: Get-
ting qualified employees to return to 
work. 
This is abundantly apparent in my 
district. The number one need of busi-
nesses, both manufacturing and service 
industries, is qualified and trained 
workers. 
This past April, Clarion County held 
their annual career fair. Employers 
from numerous sectors gathered and 
hoped to find employees of all skill lev-
els, great paying, family sustaining 
jobs available. Sadly, the career fair 
lacked individuals ready to rejoin the 
workforce. 
Stories like this are, unfortunately, 
not unique. Right now, there are more 
job openings in the United States than 
any point in our Nation’s history. 
Mr. Speaker, as we continue to re-
turn to normal and more restrictions 
are lifted, we must continue to follow 
the science and encourage Americans 
to reenter the workforce. It is time to 
fully reopen America for business and 
put Americans back to work. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, Joe 
Biden says America is on the move 
again. But to me, folks, it looks like 
Americans are still at home. There are 
a record 8 million job openings in 
America right now. Eight million, 
folks. That is the population of the 
great State of Tennessee, where I come 
from. 
We are hurting small business recov-
ery and the economic growth. We have 
got to get our country back to work, 
Mr. Speaker. Joe Biden and the Demo-
crat policies are not helping our recov-
ery. The $15 minimum wage makes it 
harder on the very small businesses. 
The McDonald’s restaurants in the dis-
trict that I represent are now starting 
folks off at $15 an hour, and some are 
offering health benefits as well. 
Bonus unemployment benefits that 
we are paying Americans to stay at 
home is just not working. The job-kill-
ing regulations that are directed at in-
dustries, like our energy sector, as 
well. The Green New Deal and more of 
this push to the left is only hurting us 
further. 
Worst of all, we are pushing tax in-
creases during an economic recovery. 
This is totally backwards, Mr. Speaker, 
and this is keeping Americans depend-
ent on Big Government, which I am not 
so certain is not the ultimate goal. 
Instead, we need to be encouraging 
the private sector to invest in recovery 
areas. My Opportunity Extension Act 
does just that, giving investors more 
time to use the highly successful Op-
portunity Zones program. 
Opportunities Zones are in areas that 
are hit hardest by COVID economic 
fallout. These Opportunity Zones rep-
resent areas such as our rural areas 
and our inner cities, areas which I am 
proud to represent. 
Our Opportunity Zones were respon-
sible for $52 billion—$52 billion, Mr. 
Speaker—in new investment, and a half 
a million new jobs in our underserved 
areas before COVID hit. 
This bill renews investment in these 
communities. 
It 
spurs 
economic 
growth. It attracts business. It is cre-
ating good-paying jobs, a much better 
alternative than the Federal Govern-
ment handouts being pushed by many 
of my colleagues across the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to dis-
cuss my bill further with anyone who 
is interested. 
I thank the vice chairman for yield-
ing to me. I appreciate you for orga-
nizing this event, brother. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend for his im-
portant comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, just like that, America faces 
four simultaneous crises: loss of con-
trol of the border, energy supply dis-
ruption, a sudden spurt of stagflation, 
and a key ally under assault. 
Why is all this happening at once on 
the eve of the 4-month anniversary of 
Inauguration Day?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2601 
May 19, 2021 
Because a weak President signals a 
weak America. The President sets the 
tone, and, today, it is very different 
than the previous 4 years. 
On the world’s stage, our adversaries 
are newly emboldened, and our allies 
more vulnerable. After several years of 
creative Trump peace deals, Israel is 
already under attack. 
Is that a coincidence? 
No. Hamas and other terrorists knew 
that with Trump there would be con-
sequences. They know with Biden there 
will be none. 
At our southern border, we have 
plateaued at a 20-year high for illegal 
border crossings. It is not slowing 
down. The word is out: You can cross 
without consequences. In fact, Biden 
and his allies think progress is expand-
ing the throughput. 
Persons are also now experiencing 
gas shortages, last seen with Jimmy 
Carter. Even before, the price at the 
pump sky-rocketed. 
Why? 
Because this President doesn’t value 
or fight for American energy independ-
ence, like the last one. Instead, he can-
cels our pipelines and green-lights Rus-
sia’s. Now families have new worries 
about their fuel budgets, while being 
lectured to by this legislation on leftist 
green energy fiascos. 
Perhaps, most pressing of all, our 
economy is not recovering as it should, 
while all the warning signs of inflation 
grow stronger. Practically every day I 
hear the same thing from North Caro-
lina small businesses, that they cannot 
find workers. And after that last pa-
thetic jobs report, it is clear that this 
isn’t isolated to any home State. 
Biden isn’t fighting for jobs. He is 
paying more to not have one. 
What we are seeing across the board 
is trickle-down weakness, and the ad-
verse effects are clear. For the first 
time in 4 years, America has a Presi-
dent who backs down without a fight, 
and it is costing us. Biden is nowhere 
to be found on the issues that matter. 
In his absence, Republicans will keep 
fighting for the American people. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, we will keep fighting, indeed. 
I thank the gentleman for his com-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, Americans are bewildered 
about what is happening in our Nation 
today. Americans who actually work 
have deep concerns about the future of 
our country. It is incredible to observe, 
from my perspective as a humble con-
stitutionalist servant within this au-
gust body, exactly what is going on 
with my colleagues across the aisle and 
our 
newly 
inaugurated 
executive 
branch. 
We have moved from policies out of 
our executive that put America first to 
policies out of the President’s adminis-
tration to put America last. We are 
facing $31 trillion in debt. 
Let me help my American brothers 
and sisters who work very hard to earn 
their living and have portions of their 
income seized and sent to Washington, 
D.C., let me help them get their head 
wrapped around $31 trillion in debt. 
If this body, which is responsible con-
stitutionally for all Federal spending, 
were to run a $1 billion surplus in a fis-
cal year—meaning we spent $1 billion 
less in Federal expenditures than we 
took in Federal revenue, $1 billion—it 
would require 31,000 years of a $1 bil-
lion surplus to address a $31 trillion 
debt. A trillion is a thousand billion, 
and a billion is a thousand million. 
It is insane what is being presented 
as fiscal responsibility out of the Biden 
administration’s White House in their 
budget request. 
President Biden shut down the Key-
stone pipeline, killed thousands of 
American jobs overnight with the 
stroke of his pen on his first day in of-
fice, and now has approved support for 
a Russian pipeline under the guise of 
ecological concern, which is why he 
shut down Keystone, which is done in-
credibly clean in America. 
The oil and gas industry, the energy 
industry in America is the cleanest in 
the world. We are going to shut down 
an American pipeline and approve and 
authorize a Russian pipeline. It is ab-
surd the direction we are going in. 
Our border crisis. My sources, which 
are accurate, we have added at least 
700,000 to 800,000 illegal crossings this 
year. Our vice president, alledgedly, 
has been put in charge of handling the 
border. She can’t find her way to south 
Texas. We should send a map to the 
White House. 
Israel. Could you imagine what our 
response should be as a nation if we re-
ceived 6,000 to 8,000 rockets fired at our 
citizens? 
We should be standing unwavering 
beside our ally, Israel. A nation that 
stands against Israel stands against 
itself. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker for 
allowing me to address the House, and 
I thank my colleague for holding this 
important Special Order this evening. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD). 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, today, our 
prayers are with our faithful friend and 
ally, Israel. The country is under at-
tack by Hamas, a terrorist organiza-
tion that will stop at nothing to kill 
and destroy. 
The world is watching and hoping 
that Iran-backed Hamas and the Pales-
tinian Liberation Organization will 
cease their destructive and reckless at-
tacks on Israel. 
Recently, pre-COVID, I had an oppor-
tunity to visit Israel. I spoke with one 
mom who talked about the horrific de-
cision they are faced with at times. 
When the alarm goes off, when the mis-
siles are coming in Israel, they know 
they have about 13 seconds to make it 
to a shelter, and they are faced with 
the decision of: Which child on the 
playground do you take with you? 
This has got to stop. Israel’s actions 
are a clear example of a nation com-
mitted to duty and responsibility of 
protecting their citizens. We know that 
Israel will continue to need our sup-
port, even after this attack subsides. 
While other nations fueled by anti- 
Semitism act to boycott, divest, and 
sanction Israel, the U.S. hopes for pros-
perity and flourishing for the Israeli 
people. As such, we support continued 
economic cooperation and bold secu-
rity assistance that benefits Israelis 
and Americans alike. 
We applaud and stand by the accom-
plishments of the Trump administra-
tion to improve peace in the Middle 
East. We recognize Jerusalem as the 
true 
capital 
of 
Israel. 
We 
affirm 
Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan 
Heights. We celebrate the historic 
Abraham Accords, reestablishing diplo-
matic ties between Israel and their re-
gional neighbors. 
We oppose efforts within the U.N. to 
undermine Israel on the global stage. 
We also oppose Iran’s nuclear ambi-
tions and call for the United States to 
withdraw from the Iran deal. 
While the Washington left remains 
weak on Israel, the American people 
stand strongly in support of the Israeli 
people. It is time for Democrats to re-
ject the extreme left, anti-American, 
anti-Israel, pro-Marxist agenda. They 
need to work with Republicans to pass 
a bill to provide security aid to the 
Israeli Government. 
b 2015 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
the Second District of Alabama (Mr. 
MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank Representative JOHNSON for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, in the last few days, 
Hamas and Palestinian Islamic jihad 
have fired 4,000 rockets targeting mil-
lions of Israeli civilians across the 
country. Thanks to Israel’s Iron Dome, 
many of these rockets have been inter-
cepted, saving thousands of lives. The 
Iron Dome is a byproduct of bipartisan 
support from Congress that provides 
critical missile defense and coopera-
tion. 
Tragically, not all of these rockets 
have been intercepted, resulting in 
senseless deaths of many innocent ci-
vilians, women and children among 
them. 
These terrorist attacks against our 
strongest ally must stop, and Pales-
tinian leaders have a responsibility to 
do all they can to stop it. 
I commend my colleagues and our 
government leaders from both sides of 
the aisle who have condemned this vio-
lence, telling the world and our mutual 
enemies that America stands strong 
with Israel. 
To those who blame Israel and accuse 
them of terrorism, I will say what I 
have always told my children: Don’t be 
the first ones who start a fight, but you 
must be willing to finish it. 
Israel has a right to defend their citi-
zens and their nation’s sovereignty.

The Lord told Abraham: I will make 
of thee a great nation, and I will bless 
them that bless thee, and I will curse 
them that curseth thee; and in thee 
shall all families of the Earth be 
blessed. 
I am proud to stand firm with Israel. 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; may 
they be secure who love you. 
Psalm 122.6. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Amen to 
that. I appreciate my friend and those 
great comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield next to the gen-
tleman from the Sixth District of the 
great 
State 
of 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) with more thoughts about 
Israel. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, a 
tragedy is going on in Israel. Over 4,000 
rockets have been shot from Gaza and 
a 
handful 
from 
Lebanon. 
Twelve 
Israelis and about 200 Gazans have 
died. This is entirely unprovoked on 
Israel’s part. It may have something to 
do with a future election on the West 
Bank. Iran is showing support for 
Hamas and is giving them financial 
aid, so they are partly responsible. 
Gaza, of course, could be a liveable, 
modern country. It used to be a vaca-
tion destination. And prior to 2005, 
when Israel turned it over, there were 
greenhouses for an agriculture sector. 
It is their own fault by collectively 
electing a government which not only 
declares a unilateral war, but chooses 
residential and commercial facilities as 
military 
locations, 
guaranteeing 
deaths of civilians, including children. 
Israel is a strong country, and, of 
course, they will not be defeated mili-
tarily. There is a danger, however. As 
explained by James Burnham in his 
book, ‘‘Suicide of the West’’—now over 
50 years old—a decadent West may 
blame themselves for the corruption 
and lack of caring for human life in 
Gaza. 
Some Members of this body are al-
ready doing this. 
The United States and Israel must 
not shirk from our responsibilities as 
moral leaders of the world. We support 
Israel in defending themselves from the 
attacks of the morally bankrupt gov-
ernment in Gaza. We encourage them 
to continue this fight for as long as 
necessary to make sure their citizens 
are not at risk in the future. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
the Ninth District of the great State of 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my good friend, the gentleman from 
Louisiana, our Republican vice chair, 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, since the onset of the 
pandemic, our small businesses have 
been faced with immeasurable chal-
lenges. Though our recovery from the 
pandemic is underway, businesses now 
face an unnecessary worker shortage 
due in part to enhanced unemployment 
compensation 
payments 
that 
disincentivize work. 
Each week, I speak with small busi-
ness owners from across my district 
who tell me they have open jobs, but 
can’t fill them and compete with en-
hanced unemployment. One of the larg-
est employers in my district, East 
Penn Manufacturing, is hosting weekly 
job fairs to fill hundreds of good-paying 
manufacturing jobs they have avail-
able and are going unfilled. 
Enhanced unemployment compensa-
tion was never intended, Mr. Speaker, 
to be permanent, but it is now dis-
rupting the labor market on the onset 
of what can be a strong recovery. As 
more Americans continue to get vac-
cinated and our COVID cases continue 
to decline, it is time for us to stop this 
disincentivizing work. 
Unemployment assistance programs 
should be revised to target those un-
able to work, such as parents with chil-
dren at home due to school closures or 
those not physically able. Those who 
can work and choose not to should not 
be able to receive generous unemploy-
ment compensation at a rate often 
more than $20 per hour. 
The U.S. Department of Labor re-
ports 8.1 million jobs were open in 
March, and there are plentiful well- 
paying jobs in every industry offering 
incentives for new hires across Penn-
sylvania. Despite this, Pennsylvania’s 
unemployment rate is even higher than 
the national average. 
That is why last week I sent a letter 
to the Governor of Pennsylvania urg-
ing him to better target supplemental 
unemployment compensation to those 
who truly need it and reinstate work 
search requirements that were waived 
last year. Despite an abundant job 
market, 
our 
economy 
added 
only 
266,000 jobs last week. 
Mr. Speaker, as I close, businesses 
are creating new jobs every day. We 
owe it to them to at least create job 
seekers. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank all my colleagues for 
participating tonight. I realize we are 
out of time. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

UNFUNDED LIABILITIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, be-
fore I start my presentation—and I am 
going to focus sort of on some of the 
economics, the debt and economic 
growth, particularly in some of the 
proposals that are hitting the House 
right now—I wanted to touch on some-
thing. 
We just heard a number of folks get 
up and talk about their love and caring 
for Israel, the Middle East, and the 
concerns of the conflict. I want to do 
something that is a little bit different. 
I have intense concern that our rela-
tionship with a fair and functioning re-
public in the Middle East never become 
a partisan issue. 
Maybe this will make sense. I have 
been here for a few years, and there has 
always been the ability for those on 
the left and the right to stand up and 
say: Look, we have a country that 
works. No country is perfect, but it 
works, and it respects human rights, 
and it is a functioning republic and a 
democracy in the Middle East. 
I was really sort of heartbroken last 
week. Just before I did one of these 
presentations, there was a presentation 
by not many Members, but some who 
said some pretty awful things. So I 
hope as we all want the country of 
Israel to prosper and do well—we want 
everyone in the region to prosper and 
do well—but we have to accept there 
are other bad actors particularly fi-
nancing things coming through Iran to 
some very bad actors to do horrible, 
horrible things in the region. 
I wish we could sort of step back a 
few months and think of the joy that 
many of us felt with the Abraham Ac-
cords that good things were happening. 
The caring for Israel needs to be bipar-
tisan, and my fear is we are seeing that 
start to slip where some on the hard 
left are moving away from supporting a 
fellow republic. 
This is not a good thing for all of us, 
and we need to sort of rethink that dis-
cussion, stand up for our friends, and 
tell our enemies that they can have a 
home in our hearts if they stop the bad 
acts. And maybe the Middle East, one 
day, really does have a future, as we 
saw with the vision that came from the 
Abraham Accords. 
Mr. Speaker, I get frustrated when I 
watch the floor. We all sit in com-
mittee, and so often what comes 
through these microphones are sort of 
trite talking points. 
So let’s go back to the big picture: 
What are we doing to actually deal 
with it? 
I have a new chart. I am trying to 
find over and over and over how do we 
actually all come together and under-
stand the reality? 
This is our future. This is my 5-year- 
old daughter’s future. It is $101 trillion 
in debt adjusted in today’s dollars. So 
this isn’t 30 years of inflation. This is 
today’s dollars. This is our future in 30 
years. 
Many of us want to get behind the 
microphone and say: This is Democrat; 
this is Republican. 
It is demographics. We are getting 
older as a society. We are getting older 
as a people. And the reality of it is 67 
percent of our 30-year debt is the un-
funded portion of Medicare. 
Remember, Mr. Speaker, when you 
pay your FICA tax, you are paying the 
part A, the hospital portion. The part B 
and D, someone, a retiree contributes a 
little tiny sliver to. The rest comes out 
of the general fund. When you actually 
take a look at our population, Mr. 
Speaker, the cost of healthcare, those 
things, then you start to realize it is 
the core driver of our debt. 
The blue here is the unfunded liabil-
ity with Social Security. So if you be-
lieve Americans have the right to these

earned benefits—these are earned bene-
fits—then why is it so hard to have an 
honest conversation about the un-
funded liability? 
Because, Mr. Speaker, you will get 
behind these microphones and the 
handful around here who would tell the 
truth about the math, then this be-
comes an attack television commercial 
because you told the truth. I am pas-
sionate that during my time here I am 
going to make these programs survive 
and prosper, but you first have to un-
derstand the scale of the problem. 
Mr. Speaker, do you see the little 
green wedge over here? 
At the end of 30 years, the $101 tril-
lion of debt in today’s dollars, only $3 
trillion of it is the rest to government. 
So when you get a politician who will 
say: Oh, it is the military; it is waste 
and fraud; it is foreign aid, then they 
are lying to you or they don’t own a 
calculator. 
Once again, we have got to have this 
honest conversation: The unfunded li-
abilities in Medicare and Social Secu-
rity drive U.S. sovereign debt. 
So why talk about this today? 
We have lots and lots and lots and 
lots and lots of spending that has come 
up this year. I want to walk through 
what that does. I haven’t even been 
able to do the math on the charts if we 
continue just what we have done this 
year, just in the few months what that 
actually means to the future. 
You would think we would be having 
this discussion: Hey, the economy is 
getting better. Our society is opening 
up. Let’s get Americans to work, and 
let’s get prosperity going. Because if 
we don’t have actually amazing and ro-
bust economic growth, then dealing 
with that $101 trillion of unfunded li-
ability becomes almost mathemati-
cally impossible. 
So just to try to put some things in 
context, we held a hearing today in the 
Ways and Means Committee on infra-
structure. Now, most of the discussion 
ended up becoming about infrastruc-
ture financing. But I decided it was 
good to actually come up here and 
show 
what 
is 
actually 
roads 
and 
bridges. 
So, Mr. Speaker, do you see the or-
ange right there? 
Mr. Speaker, $115 billion out of the— 
what is it—$2-something trillion is ac-
tually just roads and bridges. Much of 
the rest of the spending, if you want to 
be brutal about it, is other things that 
come shockingly close to paybacks for 
constituencies that help finance the 
left. But a lot of them are things that 
ultimately don’t belong in the infra-
structure: medical expansion and long- 
term care. It is something that is real 
we need to deal with. 
Does long-term care belong in an in-
frastructure bill? 
Republicans and Democrats can nail 
this. We can get this here. 
I will also give you another thing, 
Mr. Speaker. Many of us believe infra-
structure is actually much more than 
our traditional idea of roads and 
bridges. 
If you start to think it through, how 
much of it is technology? 
If I came to you tomorrow, Mr. 
Speaker, and said: What is the street 
down in your neighborhood going to 
look like a decade from now? 
Fifteen years from now? 
I am desperately hoping my 5-year- 
old never drives. I want her in an au-
tonomous vehicle. 
If we actually have this technology 
coming, then what does traffic look 
like? 
What does a smart city look like? 
I have done presentations here on the 
floor before of what does the future of 
infrastructure look like in a world of 
interconnectivity, where cars can be 
traveling at pretty impressive speeds 
talking to each other, your carrying 
capacity on the existing roads today 
change. 
How much discussion have we had 
that the future of infrastructure has a 
huge technology base to it? 
The information coming to your ve-
hicle tells you when there is a fire 
truck, when school is out, when there 
is a water main break to keep moving 
and flowing traffic. 
That is when my intense frustration 
is—much of the debate we have today 
is: Let’s pay back our political con-
stituencies. Let’s put this much into 
roads and bridges. And, oh, let’s com-
pletely be funding the infrastructure of 
past decades instead of being visionary 
about what the future looks like. 
b 2030 
I will give you a simple example of 
that just as a thought experiment. I 
have a fixation on the future of 
healthcare 
as 
a 
type 
of 
interconnectivity. 
Telemedicine 
be-
comes sort of a telehealth using sen-
sors and those things—cars talking to 
each other, transportation, products, 
drones. Okay, you need broadband. 
Broadband in the future for areas 
like my State of Arizona that don’t 
have it isn’t running a copper line or a 
fiber-optic line out to the middle of no-
where. It is a satellite. This last week-
end, I think we launched another 54, or 
whatever it is, low-Earth orbit sat-
ellites. 
But we have $100 billion of spending 
for moving broadband particularly out 
to rural America. Rural America, if we 
would understand technology of today 
instead of sounding like we are a dec-
ade behind, we have for my Tribal com-
munities in the middle of nowhere 
broadband. We just now need to get our 
laws, our financing, our subsidies to 
this part of this century. That is part 
of the thought experiment. 
This is one I want to try to have a 
real, 
brutally 
honest 
conversation 
about because the President has gotten 
up multiple times and said his infra-
structure package is paid for. Well, it 
is not. When you spend some time on 
it, the new taxes, a substantial number 
of them are fake. They are just fluff be-
cause when you look at the $265 trillion 
in spending that is the baseline in the 
bill, as best we can score it, $1.95 tril-
lion is the revenue. It is not real. A big 
portion of it comes from, hey, we are 
going to get the entire world to do a 
corporate minimum tax inversion so 
the 
companies 
leaving 
the 
United 
States because we raised corporate 
taxes won’t happen. 
For the Biden tax plan, for NANCY 
PELOSI’s, for the Democrats’ tax plan 
to actually work, there are components 
in here. You need the rest of the world 
to adopt a minimum tax so we don’t go 
back to pre-2016 when companies were 
abandoning the United States and tak-
ing much of that tax revenue with 
them. 
Another thing, there is a substantial 
area there where we believe there are 
billions and billions—maybe a couple 
of hundred billion—and we are going to 
collect more taxes. We are going to get 
those tax cheats. Okay, let’s say that is 
even real. How many years would it 
take to hire, train, and be able to col-
lect? Some of the estimates you are 
talking about will take several years 
before that even becomes effective. 
There are a number of things like 
that on the revenue side that are fan-
ciful. Also, no one has started to score 
the raise of corporate taxes that are in 
the Democrats’ tax portion of the in-
frastructure plan. We did a presen-
tation last week that showed about a 
million people will lose their jobs in 
the first 24 months. There will be a 
million less jobs because of the cor-
porate tax, and that is just the cor-
porate tax. That is not talking about 
the change of basis, the capital gains, 
the tax on the wealthy, all of those 
other things. 
We were trying to make an argu-
ment: If the hunger is for revenues for 
some of these, stop subsidizing the 
really, really ultrarich. When they buy 
their multimillion-dollar house on a 
beachfront, should we subsidize flood 
insurance? 
If 
someone 
is 
really 
wealthy, should you subsidize their 
electric vehicle, their solar panels, 
their power wall? 
It turns out, we were coming up with 
close to $1.4 trillion in the 10-year win-
dow that looks to be subsidies for the 
very well-off. If you do the ultra-well- 
off, it cuts that number down, but it is 
still a stunning amount of money. 
So, there is a path where you could 
cut spending instead of doing things 
that would distort economic growth be-
cause, as many of you know who may 
have watched some of these presen-
tations, I have an absolute fixation on 
the working poor. The miracle we had 
in this country in 2018 and 2019, where 
we were starting to crush the separa-
tion of income and equality, it was 
working. We came up with something 
that I believe Democrats supported, 
but they just didn’t support how we got 
there. 
We made working men and women’s 
labor valuable. We made what talents 
they brought to the marketplace valu-
able. We tried to once again say: If you 
care and love the working poor, and

May 19, 2021 
you want them to become much less 
poor, you can’t devalue their labor. But 
that is what we are doing right now. 
The number one thing you can do to 
do economic violence to the working 
poor is open up your borders. What 
happens when you import substantial 
numbers of people with similar skill 
sets? We have great data on this. You 
functionally have subjected that work-
ing-poor population in your country to 
a decade of misery where their wages 
don’t flatline. They actually go down. 
The other thing you do is inflation. 
Inflation concentrates punishment on 
elderly who have saved and the work-
ing poor because now the ability to buy 
that house, now the ability to buy an 
asset becomes so much more difficult 
to get to. 
I am not sure the left has processed 
what is going on at this moment and 
how much economic violence is actu-
ally being done by the economic deci-
sions that have happened the last few 
months here. So, let’s take a quick 
look here. 
Do you remember a couple of years 
ago, you know, way, way back, maybe 
like 2019? We would engage in debates 
here on how we are spending too much 
money on the military, too much for 
this, and 4.7 percent of GDP that year 
was going to be in borrowing. People 
were really upset on the left, and many 
of us were upset with too much spend-
ing on the right. 
This year, we are over 201⁄2 percent. If 
you want to understand inflation, if 
you want to understand what is hap-
pening to asset prices, if you are want-
ing to understand why that first-time 
homebuyer can’t buy the home, why 
that working-poor family can’t seem to 
dig themselves out, this is the begin-
ning of what we are doing. 
We are pumping so much spending, 
and the Federal Reserve is having to fi-
nance it, to create functionally fake 
money, because here is what we are 
doing. We sell bonds. Right now, the 
Federal Reserve is buying our bonds 
like crazy—in many ways, just cre-
ating cash out of thin air. There is this 
old saying: What is inflation? Inflation 
is too many dollars chasing too few 
goods. 
Instead of financing production and 
productivity in our society like the tax 
reform did in 2017, where we saw in-
credible wage growth with no inflation, 
what we did now is we helicopter- 
dropped money. Now, we have lots of 
cash in our society, which has all been 
borrowed, chasing not enough produc-
tion because we didn’t incentivize pro-
duction. We incentivized buying things. 
Great politics until you start to blow 
up people’s lives with the cost of their 
goods. 
How dangerous is inflation? You hear 
a number of our friends from the Fed-
eral Reserve—I talked to one a couple 
of nights ago, one of the region presi-
dents. She said: DAVID, it is transitory. 
How many of you have watched a lot of 
the leading economists, even the lead-
ing economists on the left side, in the 
last 3 or 4 days? They are now sounding 
the alarm. This inflation rate is not 
what they call transitory. It is not just 
a blip for 90 days, and then it is going 
away. 
There are geeky things. I am the sen-
ior Republican on the House side for 
the Joint Economic Committee, and 
there are things we will look at, being 
able to buy a futures contract on a 
steel that you are doing a multiyear 
project on, things like that. You al-
most can’t buy those right now. 
There are so many industries that 
say their inflation curve is already out 
beyond this year and into 2022. This is 
really dangerous, where we are at. 
Think of this. Last month, if you had 
annualized, we were at 4.2. But the im-
portant thing is, look at the explosion. 
Functionally, as soon as the adminis-
tration started rolling out this func-
tionally deficit financing, even though 
the President says, hey, I am paying 
for it—but you just saw, on giving 
credit for everything, there is still an-
other $600 billion of borrowing in just 
the infrastructure proposal, not all the 
others. 
This is a problem. There is a canary 
in a mine. Some folks should be really 
starting to make a point on this. 
Mr. Speaker, how many minutes do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona has 101⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Okay, I will talk 
faster. 
I know this is a little bit geeky, but 
this is important. Open borders, infla-
tion, these are components that just 
crush the very people who we were hav-
ing so much success with for a couple 
of years. 
We all talk a great game about car-
ing about working men and women, but 
we are engaged in economic malfea-
sance right now. I understand it is 
complicated, but the numbers don’t lie. 
When you start looking at these 
charts right now, when you start see-
ing just parts of the PPI hitting a 12 
percent annualized in the commodity 
goods last month, we really, really, 
really need to start taking this seri-
ously. 
Do you continue to float more debt 
to chase more helicopter money to go 
out and buy more constituents? You 
are going to see sort of a false economy 
for some of the calculations this year, 
where you may see a number that says: 
Hey, income inequality also shrunk 
this year because we gave out so much 
cash, but we also created economic vio-
lence because we created detachment 
from work. 
Remember, losing a year of work, 
losing a year of skills, losing a year of 
progress in your career path even for 
the working poor has a multiplier ef-
fect that if you look over the lifetime 
career, it is pretty devastating. 
You saw the decisions that were 
made to keep schools closed and the 
amount of economic violence to work-
ing women in our Nation. In 2019, there 
were more females in the labor market 
than men. Today, that just isn’t true. 
The last one I will give, for those 
folks who fixate on monetary policies, 
you are in an unusual moment. Re-
member, there is a difference between 
fiscal policy and monetary policy. 
Monetary is Federal Reserve: Hey, we 
are going to shrink the money supply. 
We are going to increase the money 
supply. We are going to do this to pro-
tect the purchasing value of the dollar 
for overseas, for in the country. We are 
going to use interest rates. We are 
going to use bank reserves. We are 
going to use those things as tools. 
The fiscal side is: We spend money. 
We borrow money. 
What happens when we are bor-
rowing, because we are spending so 
much, we are borrowing so much that 
we distort what they call monetary 
supply. All of a sudden, the Federal Re-
serve is having to step in and finance 
our chaos. It turns out Congress, be-
cause of its spending now, is distorting 
monetary supply. 
What this chart shows is—just take a 
look—this was the Federal Reserve bal-
ance sheet. Just before COVID, it was 
shrinking. The economy was doing so 
stunningly well. We had economic 
growth. The working poor were getting 
dramatically less poor. We had almost 
no inflation. Productivity was begin-
ning to spike in the economy. 
Remember, how do you pay people 
more money? You pay them more be-
cause of inflation and productivity. 
Well, when you pay someone more for 
inflation, they don’t get anything. 
When you pay them for productivity 
because there are new plants and 
equipment and these types of economic 
investments, that is the golden child. 
That is where you are paying people 
more because we have invested in them 
and in plants and equipment. 
That is also what is so devastating 
about the left’s tax plan right now. 
When you raise capital gains the way 
they are talking about doing without 
incentivizing investments in produc-
tivity 
and 
investments 
in 
people 
through those organizations, they are 
going to be paid less money. 
When you raise corporate taxes, 
there will be less money for those 
things that make jobs more productive, 
and we have already seen the numbers. 
We are going to unemploy a million 
people if the current corporate tax 
model comes in. 
We are now spending so much money 
that we are just distorting the mone-
tary supply for us in the world because 
the Federal Reserve needs to keep buy-
ing our bonds. They try to keep inter-
est rates as level as possible for as long 
as possible because, God forbid, when 
you are floating the scale of debt we 
are floating today, could you imagine 
if the next set of refinancing, the next 
set of bonds, were at traditionally the 
interest rates we had a decade or two 
decades ago? 
b 2045 
So I want to sort of close on this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2605 
May 19, 2021 
This over here is 2013 to 2016. This is 
2016 to 2019. Most of this economic 
change was really 2018 and 2019. 
This is mean family income. If you 
take a look, the blue is the poorest 
quartiles in our society. 2016, 2015, 2014, 
2013, going back, they were getting 
their heads kicked in. Income inequal-
ity really was growing, but it was 
growing under the Obama’s administra-
tion’s policies. 
If you take a look at what happened 
after tax reform, income inequality 
shrank. The blue here is our lowest 
quartiles. I hate that number, but it is 
economics. Working men and women, 
particularly the working poor, saw al-
most a 10 percent increase in their 
wages in those couple years. The 
wealthy only saw about 2.9 percent. 
If anyone ever wants to really dive 
into it, the discussion between supply- 
side economics and Keynesian econom-
ics and the distortion that politics 
have turned to those things, if you ac-
tually care about where we are going— 
you remember the very first chart that 
showed $101 trillion of debt that is 
coming at us. We are making our soci-
ety and our country incredibly fragile 
to an interest rate spike, a military 
conflict, or another pandemic. 
If we need infrastructure, let’s build 
infrastructure. We can work out the fi-
nancing mechanisms. But does long- 
term care really belong in the infra-
structure bill? We need a revolution in 
what healthcare is, because you saw on 
the first chart, healthcare is the pri-
mary driver of U.S. sovereign debt. 
Once 
again, 
understand 
the 
ACA, 
Obamacare, 
the 
Republican 
alter-
native, Medicare for All, are not pieces 
of legislation that change the cost of 
healthcare. When you see them, the 
percent of GDP that goes to healthcare 
stays the same. They are financing 
bills. This is one of the thought proc-
esses here that has been so difficult to 
crack through our skulls. We keep hav-
ing debates on this floor that are about 
who pays and who gets subsidized. We 
don’t have conversations of what we 
can do to unleash creativity in tech-
nology, whether it be in environment, 
whether it be in infrastructure, wheth-
er it be in healthcare. 
Until this place starts to see this in 
a holistic sort of continuous circle of 
healthcare actually has something to 
do with infrastructure, but the way 
you keep debt financing it, the debt be-
comes our fragility, and the debt is 
what is going to crush our future and 
do true economic violence to the work-
ing poor, and even to my 5-year-old 
daughter’s future. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

HONORING NEWLYN WING 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Asian American and Pacific Islander 
Heritage Month, I would like to recog-
nize Newlyn Wing. 
Newlyn Wing is a current resident of 
Orlando, Florida, who over the last 5 
years has become a passionate advo-
cate for building leadership coalitions 
in the Asian-American and Orange 
County communities. 
With a family history stemming from 
Michigan and Vietnamese refugees, he 
grew 
up 
experiencing 
the 
individ-
ualistic and collectivistic cultures of 
the United States and Vietnam. His up-
bringing created a belief within Newlyn 
that our collective well-beings are tied 
to each other’s progress. He believes 
when our best individual efforts and 
perspectives are shared, we can all 
progress forward. 
This principle led him to pursue lead-
ership positions and projects with local 
and national nonprofits and associa-
tions. He holds roles as the president of 
the National Association of Asian 
American Professionals, Orlando chap-
ter, and the chief strategy officer role 
with the NAAAP national. Newlyn is 
passionate about strategies and part-
nerships that give individuals a plat-
form for building their leadership and 
having a true impact in their indus-
tries and communities. 
In his work within the Orange Coun-
ty community, Newlyn has created 
leadership programs for high school 
and college students, helped lead voter 
education initiatives, and led efforts to 
increase the representation of Asian 
American Pacific Islanders in commu-
nity leadership positions. He is grateful 
for the amazing leadership teams he 
has been a part of and for the oppor-
tunity to serve his community. 
Outside of his community volunteer 
work, Newlyn currently serves as asso-
ciation manager for Junior Chamber 
International USA, a not-for-profit or-
ganization of young active citizens. 
The JCI USA mission, to provide devel-
opment opportunities that empower 
young people to create positive change, 
aligns with Newlyn’s passion and back-
ground. 
For this and more, Mr. Newlyn Wing, 
we honor you. 
HONORING ADRIAN LEE 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize Adri-
an Lee.

For this and more, Adrian Lee, we 
honor you. 
HONORING DR. HEFANG LIN 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Asian Amer-
ican Pacific Islander Heritage Month, I 
would like to recognize Dr. Hefang Lin. 
Dr. Hefang Lin received her Ph.D. in 
statistics from Virginia Tech in 1999. 
She has published many papers in jour-
nals, such as the Journal of Statistical

ing the community together while pro-
moting inclusivity and the rich herit-
age of Asian Americans, since 2012. In 
order to advocate for Asian cultures, 
diversity, and inclusiveness, she leads 
numerous events, such as cultural per-
formances, art contests, and awards. 
During the pandemic, when face masks

Dr. Lin now lives with her husband in 
Oviedo, Florida, and has two beautiful 
daughters. 
For this and more, Dr. Hefang Lin, 
we honor you. 
HONORING ONCHANTHO AM 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize 
Onchantho Am. 
Onchantho Am makes no secret of 
her humble beginnings. She is a child 
of Cambodian refugees who escaped the 
Khmer Rouge. Due to unfortunate cir-
cumstances, she and her siblings were 
removed from her parents’ care and 
placed in the foster system. One of her 
first recollections of the judicial sys-
tem was when she advocated on behalf 
of her siblings to have them reunited

under one roof. Rather than being bro-
ken by such adversity, she embraced 
her experiences to fuel a passion for 
public service and child advocacy. She 
aged out of the foster system and went 
on to become the first in her family to 
attend college and graduate from the 
University of Florida. She earned her 
J.D. from Stetson University College of 
Law, where she earned the prestigious 
Victor O. Wehle Trial Advocacy Award 
and the Thomas E. Penick, Jr. Award. 
Onchantho is the vice president of 
quality and chief legal officer of 
IMPOWER, Inc., where she leads the 
organization to new levels working 
diligently to improve the lives of chil-
dren and families. 
Outside of work, Mrs. Am is heavily 
involved in the legal and the Asian 
American Pacific Islander community. 
As the president of the Greater Orlando 
Asian American Bar Association, she 
put public service and community out-
reach to the forefront, spearheading 
several successful virtual programs, in-
cluding the Voter Initiative, the Asian 
Fusion Nights, Cooking for a Cause, 
and Stop AAPI Hate panel. She is also 
an active board member of the Na-
tional Association of Asian American 
Professionals, a member of the Orange 
County Asian American Committee, 
and the scholarship chair of the Orange 
County Bar Association Foundation. 
But for all her accomplishments and 
accolades, her greatest pride and joy is 
to share with her husband the adven-
ture of raising three multiracial daugh-
ters to become strong, empowered 
women. 
For this and more, Mrs. Onchantho 
Am, we honor you. 
HONORING SHALLY WONG 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander Heritage

we honor you. 
HONORING SADIQULLAH BABURI 
Mr. SOTO. In honor of Asian Amer-
ican and Pacific Islander Heritage 
Month, I would like to recognize 
Sadiqullah Baburi. 
Sadiqullah Baburi, born on June 10, 
1977, to father Baqi Baburi and mother 
Sadeeqa Baburi in Kandahar, Afghani-
stan, is the oldest of eight siblings. The 
Soviet occupation of the eighties took 
many of his family members’ lives and 
forced him and his family to flee their 
home and brought them to the United 
States in the year 1990. 
Supporting his family financially, 
Sadiq worked as a dishwasher with his 
brother-in-law Mohamed Amin in a 
diner in Schenectady, New York, until 
they gathered enough money to build 
their own restaurant in Newark, New 
Jersey. After several years, he moved 
with his entire family to Florida and 
eventually 
opened 
his 
newest 
res-
taurant with his brother-in-law, Ken-
nedy Chicken and Grill, named after 
the airport he and his wife first arrived 
in as immigrants. The restaurant em-
ploys many immigrants who came to 
the U.S. seeking new opportunities as 
he and his family did years ago. 
b 2100 
At the present moment, Sadiq has 
four children. He and his wife have 
been married since 1996. Mr. Baburi 
contributes to many local charities 
through his small business work in the 
central Florida community. 
For this and more, Mr. Sadiqullah 
Baburi, we honor you. 
HONORING FRANCISCO RUEDA HALILI, M.D., 
F.A.C.S. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, in honor of 
Asian American and Pacific Islander 
Heritage Month, I would like to recog-
nize Dr. Francisco Rueda Halili, M.D., 
F.A.C.S. 
Dr. Francisco ‘‘Frank’’ Halili, M.D., 
is a man who appears to have more 
than 24 hours in a day. And for every 
single second of those extra hours, 
there is a man living life to the fullest, 
a man of God and country. He uses his 
time, talents, and treasures to help 
others. 
A board-certified general surgeon in 
the central Florida area for more than 
27 years, Dr. Halili’s sharp mind and 
skillful hands have sought to provide 
the best care for everyone he meets. It 
is hard to even imagine the number of 
lives he has changed either directly or 
indirectly as a doctor. 
Born in Manila, Philippines, to Fili-
pino-U.S. immigrants who made sac-
rifices, like many other immigrants do 
when starting over in the U.S., he was 
instead raised by his grandmother in 
the Philippines. 
A graduate of Ateneo de Manila High 
School, he would eventually attend 
Florida Southern College, majoring in 
biochemistry, and later attend medical 
school at the University of Miami 
School of Medicine, class of 1988. 
Dr. Halili did his surgical residency 
at Brookdale Hospital Medical Center 
in Brooklyn, New York, and started his 
private practice in 1993 as a general 
surgeon in Kissimmee, Florida. 
Anyone who has ever seen Dr. Halili 
in the operating room knows of his 
love for his alma mater and UM Hurri-
cane sports. His medical students and 
nurses can easily spot him proudly 
wearing anything and everything Uni-
versity of Miami, orange and green, all 
the way down to his famous orange-col-
ored operating room shoes. Go Canes. 
Over his 27-year career, it is hard to 
say exactly how many hours Dr. Halili 
has spent in surgery, with delicate 
hands caring for his patients. But for 
every one of those hours, getting to the 
four hospitals no matter what time or 
emergency, he has somehow defied the 
laws of physics and created even more 
time in the day to be a full-time loving 
husband to Joanna and devoted father 
to Francis and Francene. 
For this and more, Dr. Francisco 
Halili, we honor you. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
NEWS FROM OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, since 
our last couple of floor periods, I had a 
chance to visit our southern border one 
more time, and I would like to point 
out what is going on there because I 
think it is the most important issue in 
America today. 
So that our listeners understand, 
there are two classes of people who 
come to our border. There are people 
who are caught or deal with the Border 
Patrol—and a lot of people want to be 
found by the Border Patrol because 
they think they can come into this 
country through an asylum process— 
and there are other people who sneak 
across the border. 
In April, our Border Patrol touched— 
or dealt with about 178,000 individuals. 
A year ago, that number was 17,000. So 
we have voluntarily gone up from hav-
ing the Border Patrol deal with about 
17,000 to 178,000. 
As we deal with more people who are 
touched by the Border Patrol, the Bor-
der Patrol has to spend more time 
doing paperwork, particularly with the 
children. 
We have another group of people 
coming across the border called get-

aways. Because they are get-aways, no-
body knows exactly how many there 
are. We do have drones. We do have our 
new wall together with sensors. And we 
are guessing right now that the num-
ber of get-aways has gone from about 
10,000 a month a year ago to 30,000 a 
month. 
We feel when you combine the two 
totals, we are going from about 10,000 a 
month people coming across our border 
to—just guessing—70- to 80,000 people a 
month crossing our border. 
One thing I found at the border is 
that it is a misnomer to say most or all 
of these people are necessarily coming 
from Mexico or Central America. The 
last time I was down there, we looked 
at the three western sectors of the 
Mexican border. There are nine sectors. 
We looked at the San Diego, El Centro, 
and Yuma sectors. 
In the San Diego sector, the second 
most 
common 
nationality 
coming 
across at the time we were down there 
was Russian. In the other two sectors, 
the most common nationality for quite 
a while had been Brazilian. 
While I was there, we watched Border 
Patrol process a group of about 40 peo-
ple coming across. They weren’t even 
from one country. It was a group, and 
some of the people were from Russia, 
some were from Romania, some were 
from Cuba. 
When we looked at the facilities the 
Border Patrol had down there, they had 
names of countries in—what else to 
call them—pens, where they were hold-
ing people. Sometimes a lot of people 
were kind of squished together. 
Another country that people are 
commonly coming from was Ecuador. I 
said a lot of people are coming here 
from Cuba. We saw a large pen for peo-
ple from India, though, to be honest, 
nobody was in it. But in any event, 
people are coming here from all around 
the world. 
We also noticed at the border that 
the huge slats used to build the wall, 
which they had to cut short on, are ap-
parently being stolen. Somebody paid 
for all these things that were supposed 
to be used to build a wall that was 30 
feet high above the ground and 8 feet 
below the ground. 
We cut short the building of that 
wall right when President Biden was 
sworn in. We already paid for the 
equipment. There was a lot of equip-
ment used to put together the wall 
that had been rented. Apparently that 
money was wasted. Right now, the 
slats used for the wall are apparently 
being stolen at night by people who are 
selling them on the market. 
One other observation about the 
wall: There has been an increase of 
traffic coming by boat in the San Diego 
area. And the reason the Border Patrol 
thinks that is true or the reason it is 
true is because of the effectiveness of 
the wall. Because the wall is doing a 
good job, people are more likely to get 
in a boat, go 20 miles out to sea and 20 
miles back to come in. 
The people who are let in this coun-
try pending an asylum hearing are put 
all over the country. They are fre-
quently left with a nonprofit organiza-
tion, perhaps the Catholic Social Serv-
ices, and they find somewhere for them 
everywhere you look. 
Another thing that you have to real-
ize as things get worse with the wall is 
the number of drugs coming across the 
southern border. I had always won-
dered what would happen to the drug 
cartels as marijuana was legalized in 
the United States. One of the argu-
ments for legalization of marijuana is 
it would weaken the drug cartels. Be-
cause they would no longer have to 
sneak the drugs across the border, that 
what would happen is that they would 
grow the marijuana in greenhouses 
here—Colorado, 
Washington, 
where 
have you—and the drug gangs would 
dry up. Not so. 
I recently heard an anecdote in which 
a lot of marijuana was shipped across 
the border, and they couldn’t find any-
body to sell it to because the quality of 
marijuana grown in America is supe-
rior to the marijuana grown in Mexico. 
Because it is no longer that profitable 
to ship marijuana across the border, 
what happens is there has been a dra-
matic increase in more severe drugs: 
heroin; cocaine; meth; and the worst of 
all, fentanyl. 
We recently hit a new record in 
which we have had 90,000 deaths in a 12- 
month period in the United States. In 
Milwaukee County, of which I rep-
resent a part, there were 540 deaths last 
year. Milwaukee County is not big like 
Cook County or some of these other 
counties around here. It is about a mil-
lion people. 540 deaths in Milwaukee 
County is a huge deal. For whatever 
reason, I think the press has underpub-
licized it. 
b 2110 
I think one of the reasons for the big 
increases is because you are seeing 
more and more dangerous drugs com-
ing across the southern border. 
I would like to give a tip of the cap 
to the dogs that the Border Patrol uses 
at the border. When we were down 
there, we saw dogs who had detected 
fentanyl located in a gas tank. Of 
course, a gas tank smells so much, you 
figure there is no way that a dog could 
detect that because the smell of the 
gasoline is so strong. But even there, 
the dogs had detected it. 
The thing is, the dogs could only 
sniff so many cars coming across. It 
would be a good idea if the Border Pa-
trol would get more dogs. 
In any event, if you want to talk 
about 
an 
underpublicized 
problem: 
90,000 deaths in America last year from 
drug overdoses. At least at the drug ad-
ministration in Milwaukee County, 
they speculated that the drugs that 
killed every one of the 540 people down 
there, either the drugs themselves or 
the ingredients for the drugs came 
across the southern border. 
Now, you might say: Can we do any-
thing to prevent this? Can we do any-
thing to prevent there being 17,000 up 
to 178,000 contacts coming across the 
border? Yes. 
Why did we not have a problem a lit-
tle while ago, and what changed it? 
First of all, President Trump had ne-
gotiated something called the migrant 
protection protocol in which people 
were held on the Mexican side of the 
border pending a hearing for asylum. 
Because of that, less people showed up 
in the first place. President Biden got 
rid of President Trump’s agreement 
with Mexico to hold people at the 
southern border. First of all, more peo-
ple are let in right away, and secondly, 
it advertises to prospective illegal im-
migrants around the world that now is 
the time to come. 
Secondly, we had an asylum coopera-
tive agreement with the Central Amer-
ican countries to hold people south of 
the Mexican border. In other words, if 
somebody wanted to come up from 
Venezuela and said, ‘‘I need protection. 
I need asylum,’’ they were held in Cen-
tral American countries. Obviously, if 
they were concerned that they were 
being persecuted by the government, 
why would you have to come to the 
United States? It would be perfectly 
fine to stay in Guatemala, stay in El 
Salvador, wherever. That agreement 
was torn apart. 
Finally, we changed the way we are 
dealing with COVID. Given the big deal 
we make about COVID, it is kind of 
surprising the Biden administration is 
letting people in without being tested 
for COVID, but they are. 
Between these three things, we have 
managed to go to probably about 10,000 
people who we don’t want coming here 
a month to an unknown number, but 
probably 70,000 to 80,000. 
I am afraid what will happen is that 
number will continue to grow. One of 
the reasons it is so much greater than 
it was in the past is because the gangs 
that help people get here charge people 
to come here. They charge $3,000 for a 
Mexican to cross the border, about 
$5,000 for a Central American. I am told 
$9,000 to $10,000 for a Brazilian. 
Obviously, as it is easier to come 
here, the drug gangs will educate peo-
ple in other countries and market in 
other countries to see if they can get 
here. 
Other comments that I learned at the 
border: We already, in this fiscal year, 
have 6,000 arrests. That is over twice 
the amount we had in the entire last 
fiscal year. And these are for very seri-
ous crimes. 
I also want to point out that usually 
you frequently only know if somebody 
has committed a crime or if somebody 
is a criminal if they committed a crime 
in this country. You don’t know if they 
are coming here to escape from another 
country. So, we are letting an in-
creased number of a criminal class in 
this country. 
It is estimated that 33 percent of the 
women who come to this country, on 
their way up, as they walk through 
Mexico, are abused. Some of these 
women may find they have to pay the

money they are supposed to give to the 
gangs by being trafficked, and that is a 
horrible thing. I don’t know where 
these people are in this building who 
purport to be concerned about human 
trafficking, but one way women can 
pay their way, for their $5,000 or $8,000 
or whatever, is obvious. The current 
system encourages that. 
Another problem with it is when peo-
ple cross the border, and it is a very 
mountainous border, whether you are 
in Arizona, whether you are in Cali-
fornia, whether you are in New Mexico, 
you can wind up dehydrating to death. 
The drug gangs that show people how 
to get here do not take people nec-
essarily all the way to civilization. 
They take them across the Mexican 
border, and they may say there is a 
town 10 miles that way or 15 miles that 
way. There may or may not be a town 
that close. 
The Americans do put jugs of water 
out for people and hope they survive. 
But last year, in the Tucson sector 
alone, they found 100 people dehydrated 
to death, which is another problem 
that you have with this hodgepodge at 
the border. 
Another problem that you find out is 
the children who come across the bor-
der, sometimes the children are people 
who are borrowed or rented or what-
ever from other people and are not re-
lated to the people who claim to be 
their parents or relatives in some fash-
ion. Sometimes, we are able to identify 
that with DNA testing. Sometimes, we 
don’t. 
Children come up, maybe young chil-
dren, even 7- or 8-year-old children, 
have fastened to their clothing who 
they are supposed to contact when 
they come here. The United States, 
under a bad court decision—in my 
opinion, a bad court decision—those 
children, rather than, say, being sent 
back to their parents in Honduras, may 
be sent to their supposed aunt or uncle 
in New York. 
In the United States, when the chil-
dren come to the border, they provide 
transportation to get those little kids 
to somewhere in the United States. 
The idea being that once one child 
comes here, eventually, the rest of the 
family is going to follow. 
All the way across the board, we have 
a very dangerous situation. I implore 
the Biden administration to do some-
thing about this, and I implore the 
American public to get upset about 
this and demand that their Congress-
man does something. 
I think the first thing we have to do 
is, of course, beg the Mexican Govern-
ment to reinstate the migrant protec-
tion protocol, beg the Central Amer-
ican governments to reinstate the asy-
lum cooperative agreements, and do 
what we can to immediately test for 
COVID the people coming across the 
border. 
The next thing we have to do, Mr. 
President, is address the Vice Presi-
dent. The Vice President was appointed 
over 8 weeks ago now to be the czar for 
the southern border. I have been at the 
border three times this year. You do 
not know what is going on at the bor-
der unless you literally sit down, talk 
to the Border Patrol agents, talk to 
law enforcement of the counties that 
are on the border, talk to the ranchers 
who have to live with people crossing 
their land. 
Clearly, Vice President Harris is not 
interested in finding these things out. I 
have made bad hires in my life. I have 
assigned people to jobs that maybe 
they couldn’t do that well. I beg Presi-
dent Biden, who says he is a moderate, 
to find somebody else to be the border 
czar. 
The current situation in which we 
have the number of people let in this 
country rocketing up is just unaccept-
able. If Ms. HARRIS, or Vice President 
Harris, can go 8 weeks without visiting 
the border, it clearly shows that she is 
insubordinate, is not interested in 
doing a good job. There must be some-
body else in the Biden administration 
who can pick up the slack and express 
some interest in closing our border. 
I should digress and point out that 
this does not mean we are anti-immi-
gration. In 2019, almost 850,000 new citi-
zens were sworn in, in this country. 
There are work visas, as well. There 
are plenty of ways to come into this 
country legally, but we do not need 
this massive sea of people coming here 
illegally. 
Again, I implore the American pub-
lic. When we see the Border Patrol 
touch 178,000 people a month, that is 
unacceptable. When we talk about 
30,000 getaways, that is not acceptable. 
The numbers are going to continue to 
spiral up as we have had public com-
ments from both the President and 
Vice President that indicate they are 
not interested in enforcing our laws. 
b 2120 
Now I would like to touch briefly on 
another crisis that I hope the Amer-
ican public expresses their concern 
about during our 3-week recess. 
There have always been people trying 
to destroy America. And America is 
such a hope for people all around the 
world, both our example and the fact 
that we do have many immigrants 
coming here. There have been various 
ideologies which have been used to 
overthrow our government, or change 
our government so it is no longer in ac-
cordance with our Constitution. 
John Adams said our Constitution is 
fit for a moral and religious people and 
not fit for anyone else. 
There was a time when Marxists tra-
ditionally felt they could destabilize 
the American population and that way 
have a rebellion in the United States. 
Eventually, they gave up hope on tra-
ditional Marxism, or at least gave up 
hope for a while. 
The reason they gave up hope is, 
quite frankly, the American middle 
class was so prosperous. And in Amer-
ica you could find just by going to 
work, 
working 
hard, 
saving 
some 
money, you could buy a house bigger 
than what you would find in any other 
country. And as a result, the lure of 
Marxism, which took over in China— 
albeit with some mistakes made by the 
American 
Government—which 
took 
over in Russia, which took over in 
Cambodia, resulting in maybe over 100 
million deaths of Marxists caused in 
other countries, not to mention the de-
struction of the churches, the destruc-
tion of the family. That failed. 
More recently, the left-wingers in our 
university system has taken it upon 
themselves to talk about critical race 
theory. Now under classic Marxism, 
they try to take over by educating the 
American public that they should be 
bitter and angry, and they should want 
to revolt so that they could own the 
factories or own the big houses, and 
have a revolution that way. 
The new effort is to try to create 
anger based on race, and they call it 
critical race theory. And they want to 
tell people that if you don’t have all 
you have, it must be because of racism. 
If you don’t have the nice house you 
want, if you don’t have a big amount in 
your savings account, or whatever, 
that is the problem. 
Recently, I ran into a little bit of 
what I will call critical race theory in 
one of my local high schools. In the 
high school, a teacher educated a class, 
which was devoted to racism, men-
tioned that in the past year, 4 percent 
of the kids in this high school were 
Black, and 20 percent of the kids who 
were arrested were Black. The teacher 
told the kids, of course, or implied to 
the kids that this was the result of rac-
ism. 
There is a problem twice. First of all, 
you are educating people in the United 
States of America, which we have just 
covered, the whole rest of the world 
wants to get in here. You are educating 
kids that America is not worth pre-
serving, America is not worth fighting 
for, America is a bad country. 
Secondly, you educate people that if 
they are arrested for drugs, for fight-
ing, what have you, or if the police 
interact with you, it is not a matter of 
you did something wrong, it is a mat-
ter of racism. 
I can’t think of any clearer way to 
make sure that people do not progress 
in our system than telling them that if 
they do something wrong, the punish-
ment was not because they deserve the 
punishment, it was because of racism. 
But this is the mindset that is out 
there right now in our schools. It is the 
mindset that is out there in our large 
businesses and in our military. 
I think people have to educate them-
selves as to what critical race theory 
is, because clearly, the goal of critical 
race theory is to make people not 
proud or not respect the United States 
and, furthermore, make people bitter 
and angry, and tell people rather than 
work hard—you work 45–50 hours a 
week, try to afford a house, try to have 
children, buy a car—it tells people if 
you don’t have all you want, it is be-
cause of racism.

May 19, 2021 
And there is no way teaching our 
young people that is going to lead to 
anything other than resentment and a 
great deal of unhappiness. I think it is 
obvious that America does not have 
the racist problems that other coun-
tries have. And I beg people to read 
about countries like India, countries 
like Somalia, where minor ethnic dif-
ferences 
result 
in 
deaths, 
huge 
amounts of discrimination. 
Here in the United States, in recent 
years, Asians, and before that, many 
other 
different 
so-called 
minority 
groups 
outdid 
financially—finances 
aren’t everything—but financially ex-
ceeded the native-born. 
We can see that America is not a rac-
ist country because I talked about, a 
second ago, people from all around the 
world are trying to get in here, and al-
most nobody ever wants to leave. So 
when it really comes to saying it is 
bad, no one wants to leave, but the 
whole rest of the world tries to come 
here, be it from Africa, be it from 
Latin America, be it from the Indian 
subcontinent, be it from Southeast 
Asia. 
So many wonderful people come here. 
My district has a lot of Hmong who are 
tremendously successful, despite com-
ing from a very different background, 
loving America, taking full advantage 
of the opportunities that are there. 
However, if we let this pernicious ide-
ology get in our schools and get in our 
businesses, it will be a success for the 
left-wing groups that have always 
wanted to destroy the special country 
that is America. 
And I encourage parents and grand-
parents and employees to report or 
publicize when they are forced to put 
up with this stuff in the schools or in 
the businesses. 
There is something for our wonderful 
American listeners to deal with over 
the next 3 weeks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities towards the

Let us pray. 
Precious Lord, we praise You because

neglecting Your plans for our future, as 
You prepare us to stand in Your pres-
ence without a single fault. 
Lord, prosper the work of our Sen-
ators. Make their efforts as secure as 
the mountains. Inspire them to strive

Conciliation Procedures’’. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, so the 
Spanish philosopher, Jorge Santayana, 
is credited with the saying, ‘‘Those 
who cannot remember the past are con-
demned to repeat it.’’ 
When it comes to January 6, we 
would all do well to heed that advice. 
But right now, there is an effort on the 
part of the House Republican leader-
ship to make sure we forget that that 
fateful day ever happened. 
Later today, the House will vote on 
establishing an independent Commis-
sion to investigate the events of Janu-
ary 6, a complement to the investiga-
tion in the House and Senate commit-
tees. Both sides negotiated for months. 
The House Republican leader made 
three specific requests in February. All 
three were granted by House Demo-
crats. Modeled after the bipartisan 9/11 
Commission, it will have equal rep-
resentation from both Democrats and 
Republicans. Subpoenas can only be 
issued if Members from both sides 
agree. 
It appeared we had reached a con-
sensus with the support of rank-and- 
file 
Republicans 
and, 
frankly, 
I 
thought the Speaker was being very 
generous because subpoena power is so 
important when you look into some-
thing, but she did that. I salute her for 
it. But even when she went that far, at 
the eleventh hour, the House Repub-
lican leadership turned tail, threw its 
own negotiators under the bus, and de-
cided to try to sabotage the Commis-
sion. Once again, they are caving to 
Donald Trump and proving that the 
Republican Party is still drunk off the 
Big Lie. 
Just one week after House Repub-
licans fired Congresswoman CHENEY for 
simply telling the truth about the elec-
tion, their new leadership is trying to 
kill a bipartisan investigation—a very 
down-the-middle bipartisan investiga-
tion—of the attack on our Capitol. 
At the root of both efforts is the 
shameful desire to protect Donald 
Trump and perpetuate the Big Lie, 
even though it undermines our democ-
racy, because when people don’t believe 
elections are on the level, that is the 
beginning of the end of a democracy. 
What the Republicans are doing—the 
House Republicans—is beyond crazy. 
To be so far under the thumb of Donald 
J. Trump, letting the most dishonest 
President in American history dictate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2746 
May 19, 2021 
the prerogatives of the Republican 
Party, will be its demise. Mark my 
words. Whatever that means for Demo-
crats, it is bad for America. 
We all know there needs to be a thor-
ough and honest accounting of what 
took place on January 6, the greatest 
attempt at insurrection since the Civil 
War. We have to make sure such a des-
picable event never repeats itself. That 
is why we need the investigation. 
Getting at the truth is more impor-
tant now that some Republicans are 
trying to rewrite history. It is just in-
credible what they are doing. How dis-
honest can they be, in abject fear of 
the most dishonest President who has 
ever sat at the White House, Donald 
Trump, who will tell lies at will? He 
doesn’t care. It is only his own ego. We 
know that. One Member said it was a 
‘‘boldfaced lie’’ to call it an insurrec-
tion and likened the mob to a ‘‘normal 
tourist visit.’’ Give me a break. 
Several Members have spread the lie 
that 
it 
was 
actually 
Antifa 
that 
stormed the Capitol and so have some 
commentators on one of our leading 
news 
networks—shamefully, 
shame-
fully. 
One Republican went so far as to say 
the mob, not the police, were the real 
victims of the violence that day. Can 
you imagine being in the family of one 
of the police officers who died or was 
injured? It is bad enough, but hearing 
that? How far will they go in obeisance 
to the lying President Donald Trump? 
How far? 
These are dangerous lies rooted fun-
damentally in the Big Lie that has 
seemingly enveloped the Republican 
Party. Shame on them. Shame on the 
Republicans for choosing the Big Lie 
over the truth—not all Republicans, 
but the majority who seem to be doing 
it. Shame. Shame on them for defend-
ing the mob over our Capitol Police of-
ficers. And shame on the House Repub-
lican leadership for punishing Repub-
licans who tell the truth, instead of 
those who poison faith in our democ-
racy. 
Here in the Senate, we will have a 
vote on the January 6 Commission. The 
only way to stop these lies is to re-
spond with the truth, with facts, with 
an honest, objective investigation of 
what happened that day. 
An independent Commission can be 
the 
antidote 
to 
the 
poisonous 
mistruths that continue to spread 
about January 6. That is what our 
Founding Fathers believed in. They be-
lieved in a fact-based nation, and they 
believed the facts will come out. Peo-
ple will have different views when they 
see those facts and assemble those 
facts, but they believe in the truth. 
I can’t think of a time when a polit-
ical party has been so abjectly far 
away from the truth than the perpet-
uation of the Big Lie. 
So again, the Senate will vote on the 
January 6 Commission. It ought to 
gain bipartisan support. There are re-
ports—sad, unfortunate reports—that 
the Republican leader here in the Sen-
ate might be following his House col-
leagues down the rabbit hole and will 
oppose the Commission. I hope that 
isn’t true. 
But the American people will see for 
themselves whether our Republican 
friends stand on the side of truth or on 
the side of Donald Trump’s Big Lie. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. President, on voting rights, the 
Texas State Senate recently passed a 
bill that repeals all requirements for 
carrying a handgun, including a valid 
license, registering fingerprints, and 4 
hours of training. Texas would be the 
sixth State to pass a permitless carry 
law, with Louisiana waiting in the 
wings. If both Texas and Louisiana 
pass these laws, fully a third of Ameri-
cans would live in States where it was 
legal to carry firearms without train-
ing or a license. 
Just one week after the Texas legis-
lature advanced that law to make it as 
easy as possible to carry a handgun, it 
advanced another law to make it hard-
er to vote. You need stringent identi-
fication to vote and no identification 
to carry a handgun. What the heck is 
going on in Texas? 
Just think about that for a moment. 
Across the country, Republican legisla-
tures are removing all barriers to carry 
firearms, while at the same time put-
ting up barriers around voting. The po-
litical right wants to make it easier for 
felons to get a gun but harder for 
younger, poorer, and non-White Ameri-
cans to vote. It is hard to think of a 
more reactionary vision for our coun-
try, a more backward-looking vision, a 
vision that eventually will be repudi-
ated not only in the history books but 
in our Nation’s politics. 
Sadly, as voter suppression laws 
sweep through Republican State houses 
from Florida, Montana, and every-
where in between, the political right is 
actually bragging about how success-
fully they are restricting the franchise. 
Last week, a spokesperson for Herit-
age Action, the lobbying arm of the 
far-right think tank, told a group of 
Republican donors that Heritage Ac-
tion was drafting new voter restric-
tions and literally handing them over 
to State legislatures in order to give 
the laws ‘‘that grassroots feel.’’ She 
went on to crow about how ‘‘quickly 
and quietly’’ her organization managed 
to get new limits on voting passed in 
Iowa. She told the donors that she 
looked at her team of rightwing lobby-
ists and said: ‘‘It can’t be that easy.’’ 
That is how the far right is talking 
about making it harder for Americans 
to vote. Behind closed doors, with well- 
heeled donors, they are laughing about 
how easy it is to limit American voting 
rights, and that is because Republican 
legislatures, from one end of the coun-
try to the other, are eagerly and will-
fully going along. It is despicable. 
In this country, in a democracy, 
when your side loses an election, you 
try to win more voters over. You don’t 
try to stop the other side from voting. 
But seizing on that Big Lie that the 
election was stolen, Republican legisla-
tures are orchestrating the greatest 
contraction of voting rights since the 
end of reconstruction and the begin-
ning of Jim Crow. 
These laws cannot go unanswered. 
Senate Democrats are moving forward 
with legislation, S. 1, to combat this 
rash of voter suppression laws. It has 
gone through the Rules Committee, 
and it will receive a vote here on the 
Senate floor. 
Our Republican colleagues need to 
decide if they are going to stand up for 
democracy or not. 
CLEAN CARS FOR AMERICA 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
clean cars, yesterday, at an event in 
Michigan, President Biden declared 
that the future of the auto industry is 
electric. He is absolutely right. 
But even though the transition to 
electric vehicles has already begun, it 
is progressing too slowly. China is out-
pacing the United States in the elec-
trical vehicle market, and the only 
way we are going to meet our ambi-
tious climate targets is to accelerate 
the transition to zero-emission vehi-
cles. 
That is why I was so glad to hear 
President Biden get into the specifics 
and talk about the many ways that 
government, industry, and labor can 
partner up to put more electric vehi-
cles on the road and create more jobs 
in the process. 
At the heart of that effort is legisla-
tion called Clean Cars for America. It 
is a proposal I drafted and introduced 
several years ago, and now it has be-
come a central component to the 
American Jobs Plan and President 
Biden’s Build Back Better agenda. 
Through a mixture of point-of-sale 
incentives for consumers, charging in-
frastructure investments, and support 
for American manufacturing of electric 
vehicles, it would make electric vehi-
cles affordable for all Americans and 
create thousands and thousands and 
thousands of good-paying union jobs in 
automaking, construction, and battery 
manufacturing. 
We need a large-scale effort to 
achieve an electric vehicle future. 
Clean Cars for America is the way to 
get there. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 2 
years ago, I spoke to a gathering of 
friends of Israel. At the time, I was 
working to advance pro-Israel legisla-
tion to combat the BDS movement.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2747 
May 19, 2021 
This was a far-left effort to create 
worldwide anti-Israel boycotts. I was 
struck, at the time, by the opposition 
to the bill from the far left, and I said 
the Democrats had to stand up to the 
growing chorus of anti-Israel voices in 
their own ranks or we would all come 
to regret it. 
Well, fast-forward to today. Our 
friends in Israel are now in their sec-
ond week of a difficult counterterror-
ism campaign. They are responding to 
unprovoked 
rocket 
attacks 
raining 
down on their people. Predictably, the 
radical fringe has leapt to excuse the 
acts of terror and, of course, blame 
Israel, as usual. But, now, dispropor-
tionate pressure is not only being 
placed on Israel by far-left activists. 
Now, sitting Members of Congress are 
actually joining in. One Democratic 
House Member has lately called Israel 
an ‘‘apartheid state.’’ Another said it is 
guilty of ‘‘terrorist acts.’’ 
For a long time, Republicans and 
Democrats have stood together in 
standing with Israel. I am proud of all 
of the work we have accomplished to-
gether, like improving Israel’s Iron 
Dome defenses, providing precision- 
guided munitions and Joint Strike 
Fighters, and collaborating on counter- 
tunneling technology to thwart terror-
ists. These bipartisan efforts have paid 
dividends for Israel and for the United 
States. 
As recently as 2014, during the last 
major 
conflict 
between 
Israel 
and 
Hamas, 
most 
Democrats 
stood 
unhesitatingly with Republicans to un-
equivocally condemn Hamas and sup-
port Israel. But, now, rather than hav-
ing Israel’s back, senior Democrats 
have actually pressured Israel to end 
its defensive operations. They have 
called for a ceasefire and urged leaders 
to strive for peace through a nego-
tiated two-state solution—as if Israeli 
Prime Ministers from across the polit-
ical spectrum haven’t made good faith 
efforts in the past toward peace. 
Of course, in this case, Israel is not 
fighting the Palestinian Authority. 
They are not up against the Pales-
tinian Authority. They are not at war 
with the Palestinian people. They are 
fighting 
Hamas. 
Everybody 
around 
here surely knows by now that Hamas 
is a terrorist group that opposes a two- 
state solution. They want Israel de-
stroyed. That is who this fight is be-
tween—Israel and Hamas—not the Pal-
estinian Authority, not the Palestinian 
people. It is between Israel and Hamas, 
Israel versus terrorists. 
So let’s dispense with this ‘‘both 
sides’’ nonsense. Only one side has 
taken credible steps toward peace, and 
even 
when 
rocketed by terrorists, 
Israel takes extraordinary pains to 
avoid harming civilians. This includes 
giving advance warning to Palestinian 
civilians in the places they are about 
to strike. It calls them up in advance 
and says: Get out of there. We are 
about to strike. 
Frankly, Israel is taking more care 
to protect Palestinian civilians than is 
Hamas, which intentionally hides be-
hind innocent people in violation of the 
laws of war and then exploits their 
deaths to advance the cause. Hamas 
doesn’t 
represent 
Palestinians 
any 
more than it represents the rest of the 
region’s Arabs, which is to say, not at 
all. 
For decades, administrations mistak-
enly assumed the road to Middle East 
peace led through agreement between 
Israel and the Palestinians and that 
nothing else could be addressed until 
this was resolved. In reality, the pre-
vious administration facilitated the 
Abraham Accords—a historic step that 
helped Israel normalize relationships 
with majority-Muslim countries like 
the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, 
and Sudan. Morocco normalized its re-
lationship as well. This progress to-
ward peace, based on shared geo-
political and economic interests, came 
in spite of intransigence from leaders 
in Gaza. 
Now the Biden administration wants 
to deny this historic progress. A few 
days ago, the President’s spokeswoman 
argued incredibly that with respect to 
the prior administration, ‘‘We don’t 
think they did anything construc-
tive’’—really?—regarding 
‘‘the 
long-
standing conflict in the Middle East.’’ 
Really? The recognition between Israel 
and 
four 
Arab 
countries 
is 
not 
progress? Give me a break. 
Now, as Israel battles terrorists, the 
Democratic chairman of the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee indicated 
this week that he might try to obstruct 
the supply of precision technologies 
that helps Israel avoid civilian casual-
ties. How does that make sense? And 
remember that Chairman MEEKS only 
chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee 
because the far-left primaried the pre-
vious chairman—a staunch Democratic 
supporter of Israel—right out of his 
seat in Congress. You can see where 
the far left is trending. This effort to 
block arms sales is basically the same 
play that some Democrats ran with 
Saudi Arabia and the Iran-backed 
Houthis in Yemen. Let’s just think 
about that. Fortunately, the latest re-
ports suggest the chairman may be 
backing down from this. I certainly 
hope so. 
Yet the White House still can’t give a 
straight answer on whether and when 
we will help Israel replenish the Iron 
Dome system that protects its citizens. 
Leading Democrats are even talking 
about easing sanctions on the Iranian 
regime, which helps fund terrorist 
proxies like Hamas and keeps their 
rocket arsenals full. They come from 
Iran—and the administration still pro-
poses to cut our own U.S. defense fund-
ing after inflation. 
So, 
listen. 
Israel’s 
enemies 
are 
watching—make no mistake—not just 
Hamas but Hezbollah and Iran’s Is-
lamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. We 
cannot send the signal that terrorist 
attacks on American allies will be met 
with 
mealy-mouthed 
attempts 
to 
blame both sides. 
ABORTION 
Now, Mr. President, on a completely 
different matter, when President Biden 
nominated Xavier Becerra to run the 
Department of Health and Human 
Services, it was clear what the Nation 
was getting—a hardened culture war-
rior with no health or medical exper-
tise. Where Secretary Becerra did have 
experience was in trying to impose a 
far-left social agenda. 
He fought and fought in Federal 
court to make religious nonprofits pay 
for things that violated their con-
sciences until he finally got creamed in 
the Supreme Court by a ruling that 
was 7 to 2. Before that, he had fought 
and fought to force crisis pregnancy 
centers to advertise abortion, trying to 
coerce a certain kind of leftwing 
speech out of private groups. The Su-
preme Court slapped him down then as 
well. That was the resume Secretary 
Becerra brought to his current posi-
tion. 
Last week, in a hearing before the 
House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, the Secretary either forgot 
about Federal law on abortion or re-
vealed that he just didn’t care what 
was on the books. When a Member of 
Congress used the common term ‘‘par-
tial-birth 
abortion,’’ 
the 
Secretary 
coyly suggested he didn’t know what 
that meant. He tried to get the Con-
gressman to use the more clinical ver-
biage that helps the far-left conceal 
this grotesque subject. Then, when 
pressed, Secretary Becerra claimed 
‘‘there is no law that deals specifically 
with the term ‘partial-birth abor-
tion.’ ’’ 
Well, the Secretary may wish that 
were the case, but it isn’t. That is com-
pletely false. 
U.S. Code, title 18, section 1531 is the 
Federal ban on partial-birth abortions. 
It uses the exact term seven times. It 
defines the banned practice in all of its 
barbaric detail. Back in 2003, I was 
proud to join with almost two-thirds of 
the Senate when we passed this main-
stream law. Our Federal ban on this 
awful procedure remains widely pop-
ular with the American people. It is 
the bare, bare minimum. Yet President 
Biden’s HHS Secretary is either igno-
rant of the Federal law or wants to pre-
tend that it actually doesn’t exist. 
Remember, the far left has kept 
America one of just seven countries— 
seven—in the world that allows elec-
tive abortions on demand after 20 
weeks. Countries across Europe, like 
France, Spain, Germany, Norway, and 
Denmark, all limit elective abortion to 
before 20 weeks. The far left wants 
America to be an outlier on the global 
fringe, and President Biden’s HHS Sec-
retary either doesn’t know or won’t 
admit that the phrase ‘‘partial-birth 
abortion’’ even appears in Federal law. 
A misstatement like that is embar-
rassing enough, but the radicalism that 
lies behind it is even worse.

S2748 
May 19, 2021 
made the decision to oppose the House 
Democrats’ slanted and unbalanced 
proposal for another commission to 
study the events of January 6. 
As everybody surely knows, I repeat-
edly made my views about the events 
of January 6 very clear. I spoke clearly 
and left no doubt about my conclu-
sions. Federal law enforcement has 
made at least 445 arrests and counting 
relating to crimes committed that day. 
Hundreds of those people have been 
charged. Law enforcement investiga-
tions are ongoing, and Federal authori-
ties say they expect to arrest at least 
100 or so more. Bipartisan investiga-
tions are also underway and have been 
for months at the committee level here 
in the Senate. 
There is, has been, and there will 
continue to be no shortage of robust in-
vestigations by two separate branches 
of the Federal Government. So it is not 
at all clear what new facts or addi-
tional investigation yet another Com-
mission could actually lay on top of ex-
isting efforts by law enforcement and 
Congress. 
The facts have come out, and they 
will continue to come out. What is 
clear is that the House Democrats have 
handled this proposal in partisan bad 
faith, going right back to the begin-
ning, from initially offering a laugh-
ably partisan starting point to con-
tinuing to insist on various other fea-
tures under the hood that are designed 
to centralize control over the Commis-
sion’s process and its conclusions in 
Democratic hands. 
I have been an outspoken critic about 
all of the episodes of political violence 
that our Nation has seen over the past 
year. I support the strong existing in-
vestigations and justice for any Amer-
ican—any American—who has broken 
the law. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Republican whip. 
AMERICAN FAMILIES PLAN 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a couple 
of weeks ago, President Biden unveiled 
his so-called American Families Plan, 
which one might summarize as free 
stuff—free preschool, free community 
college, lots of government subsidies. 
It sounds great, but the problem, of 
course, is that none of that is really 
free. The government may not send in-
dividuals a bill for any of those items, 
but that doesn’t mean they don’t have 
to be paid for by someone. So President 
Biden proposed a raft of tax hikes to at 
least partially pay for his proposals—a 
hike in the capital gains tax, an addi-
tional new death tax to add to the one 
we already have, and a hike in the top 
income tax rate. 
Now, President Biden is selling these 
tax increases as tax hikes on wealthy 
Americans, whom Democrats view as a 
bottomless source of funding for new 
government programs, but there are 
two problems with that. 
In the first place, there is no ques-
tion that some middle-class Americans 
will be hit by President Biden’s new 
death tax. While he provides an exemp-
tion for gains of $1 million or less, the 
truth is that it is possible to die with 
an estate whose value has increased by 
more than $1 million over the course of 
your life, while never breaking out of 
the middle class. We are not talking 
about individuals with a yearly income 
of $1 million; we are talking about the 
lifetime gains on assets an individual 
has at his or her death. 
Then, of course, there is a good bet 
that many of those individuals’ heirs— 
the ones whose inheritance will be di-
minished by this tax—are thoroughly 
middle class. Your parents might die 
with an estate that has gained $1 mil-
lion-plus in value, but you yourself 
might be earning just $40,000 or $50,000 
a year. 
All this is especially true in the case 
of family farms and businesses. Farm-
ing is a cash-poor business. Farmers 
might have land that has appreciated 
over decades by substantially more 
than $1 million even though the farm-
ers themselves may at times struggle 
even to break even. Levying President 
Biden’s new tax at death could perma-
nently destroy a family farm or busi-
ness. 
Now, President Biden has suggested 
that he will carve out an exemption for 
family farms and businesses if the next 
generation commits to running them, 
but it remains to be seen what that ex-
ception looks like and whether it truly 
protects family farms. He has not 
pledged to carve out an exception for 
middle-class Americans whose inherit-
ance will be hit by this new tax. 
Then there is the fact that President 
Biden’s new income tax hike will also 
hit small businesses, many of whose 
owners pour a substantial part of their 
profits back into the business instead 
of raking in a large salary. 
But even leaving all that aside and 
supposing that President Biden’s new 
taxes will be levied only on wealthy 
Americans, there is still a problem. 
Sure, if you are in the middle class, the 
government might not be sending you 
a tax bill, but that doesn’t mean you 
won’t be negatively affected by these 
taxes. 
You see, Democrats operate under 
the entirely false assumption that you 
can tax higher earners without con-
sequences, that you can tax invest-
ments without consequences, and that 
you can tax businesses without con-
sequences. In Democrats’ world, you 
can heavily tax something, but no one 
will behave any differently. No one will 
reduce his or her investments. No busi-
ness will flee high tax rates by moving 
overseas. No business will pass on high-
er tax bills to consumers in the form of 
higher prices at a time when inflation 
is already on the rise. 
But, of course, in the real world, peo-
ple do respond to tax hikes. Businesses 
raise prices on their products, they 
limit wage growth to their workers, 
and they create fewer jobs. In fact, 
studies suggest that 50 to 70 percent or 
more of the burden of corporate tax 
hikes is borne by workers in the form 
of lower wages and fewer job opportuni-
ties. 
Corporations also move overseas. Be-
fore Republicans lowered the corporate 
tax rate to make American businesses 
more competitive in the global econ-
omy, a significant number of American 
companies were moving their head-
quarters overseas. 
Small businesses hit with big tax 
hikes cut jobs or limit their creation of 
new ones. They raise prices. They de-
cide not to expand. 
Investors hit with major tax hikes 
decide not to invest as much. Since in-
vestment fuels jobs and innovation, 
both of those suffer as a result. 
In every one of these cases, ordinary 
Americans are affected—not just the 
rich; not just millionaires; ordinary, 
middle-class 
Americans. 
After 
all, 
most Americans, if they are not self- 
employed or working for government, 
are employed by businesses. If the busi-
ness they work for isn’t doing well, 
their prospects are going to be signifi-
cantly affected. If businesses hold down 
wages to deal with the impact of tax 
hikes, for example, ordinary Ameri-
cans’ long-term earning potential will 
be diminished. These effects may not 
sound as concrete as being handed a 
tax bill, but they have just as real of 
an impact on Americans’ income and 
Americans’ lives. 
Democrats talk a lot about making 
the rich pay their fair share. We hear it 
constantly. From the way Democrats 
talk, you would think that rich people 
rarely pay any taxes. That is not even 
close to being the case. 
The fact is that our tax system is 
highly—highly—progressive, the most 
progressive in the world, and the tax 
relief Republicans passed 3 years ago 
actually made it even more progres-
sive. 
In 2013, individuals making over $1 
million paid twice as much per dollar 
in taxes—I should say in 2018, individ-
uals making over $1 million paid twice 
as much per dollar in taxes as individ-
uals making between 75,000 and $100,000 
or more than 10 times—10 times as 
much per dollar as individuals making 
between $20,000 and $30,000. 
It would be interesting to know what 
exactly Democrats consider to be a fair 
share. 
When 
financially 
successful 
Americans are paying half of their in-
come in taxes, is that when it is fair? 
Seventy-five percent of their income? 
Ninety-five percent of their income? 
And when they are paying that much, 
what happens then? Well, I have al-
ready indicated what happens. Invest-
ment declines, wages stagnate, prices 
go up, job creation goes down, and ordi-
nary Americans start feeling the con-
sequences. But, unfortunately, Demo-
crats are so used to viewing the 
wealthy as an inexhaustible source of 
money that they refuse to admit that 
hiking taxes on wealthier Americans 
will have consequences. 
It even goes further than that. It is 
not just that Democrats view wealthier 
Americans as an inexhaustible source

of money; it is that Democrats are well 
on their way to a kind of Marxist-style 
class warfare that demonizes success. 
Nowhere is that more evident than in 
the fact that Democrats are proposing 
a capital gains tax hike on the wealthy 
that will fail to maximize government 
revenue. That is right. Democrats 
could actually get more revenue to pay 
for their social programs if they raised 
the capital gains tax less. Democrats 
are proposing a capital gains increase 
so substantial that it will actually re-
turn less government revenue—thanks 
to the resulting decrease in invest-
ment—than a lower rate hike would re-
turn. 
At the level of tax hike Democrats 
have proposed, the tax hike becomes 
less about raising government revenue 
and more about punishing more pros-
perous Americans for being successful, 
which is a pretty un-American way of 
looking at things. Democrats like to 
portray the wealthy as a bunch of bil-
lionaires sitting on inherited piles of 
money and not doing a day’s work. But 
the truth is that a lot of prosperous 
people in this country are, A, not bil-
lionaires, and B, only wealthy because 
they worked hard, saved, and made 
prudent financial decisions and took 
advantage of the opportunities they 
were given. 
Focusing 
on 
punishing 
successful 
Americans for being successful instead 
of focusing on how we can create op-
portunity and remove obstacles to suc-
cess for everyone else is counter-
productive because it has a negative ef-
fect on our economy. It fosters an at-
mosphere of envy instead of possibility, 
hostility 
instead 
of 
determination. 
Rather than focusing on how we can 
lift everybody up, the focus becomes on 
how we can drag part of society down. 
Rather 
than 
counterproductively 
hiking taxes to punish the successful 
or pay for an ever-increasing array of 
government programs, we should be fo-
cusing on creating an economy that 
gives every single American the chance 
for success and that reduces the need 
for government programs by increasing 
economic opportunity for all Ameri-
cans. Unfortunately for the American 
people, Democrats’ tax hikes will have 
the opposite effect. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has 
been my good fortune to serve in the 
U.S. Senate for several terms and in 
the House before. I can remember this 
Chamber from my first visit when I sat 
in that Gallery as a college student and 
watched the proceedings of the U.S. 
Senate, and I can remember so many 
historic days that I have been blessed 
to have a front-row seat to observe 
great memories. But in addition to 
those great memories, there is one sad 
memory—no, it was more than sadness; 
one memory that brings sadness and 
anger—and it is related to January 6 of 
this year. 
I remember that day so well. The 
Vice President of the United States, 
Michael Pence, was presiding over the 
U.S. Senate. We were counting the 
electoral votes to determine the offi-
cial outcome of the previous election. 
The President of the United States, 
Donald Trump, was holding a rally 
near the White House, not far from 
Capitol Hill. The demonstrators who 
came to his rally then marched on this 
Capitol, and what transpired after that 
was historic and shameful. 
I remember the moment when the 
Vice President of the United States 
was spirited off that platform, yanked 
by his arms out that door. Clearly his 
security detail felt that his life was in 
danger, and they removed him. 
I remember a member of the Capitol 
Police coming, standing on the podium 
in front of the Senate, and saying that 
we should remain in our seats, that 
this was going to be a safe place, this 
room, the Senate Chamber. Then they 
started bringing in the staff, who were 
gathered around the Chamber, to stand 
along the walls because of the safety of 
this circumstance. So we knew there 
was something happening in the Cap-
itol. 
Minutes later, just minutes later, 
that 
same 
Capitol 
policeman 
an-
nounced: ‘‘Evacuate this room as fast 
as you can. As quickly as you can, 
move off this scene and go to another 
place.’’ 
I never thought that I would see that 
in the U.S. Capitol Building, nor in the 
Chamber of the U.S. Senate, but it was 
a reality. 
As we quickly moved out through the 
exits, all the Senators and staff, I re-
member looking out the window and 
seeing hundreds of people descending 
on the Capitol. That was the snapshot 
in my mind as we quickly escaped the 
danger in the U.S. Capitol Building. 
We know at the end of the day that 
at least five people lost their lives. We 
know that 140 law enforcement were 
assaulted by this mob who tried to 
take control of the Capitol during the 
electoral college count. Of course, 
there is ample historic evidence of 
what happened—videotapes galore, vid-
eotapes from every angle, information 
gathered. 
That is why I was skeptical when 
they suggested creating a Commission 
to chronicle what happened on January 
6. We saw it. We lived it. America 
watched it, many times on live tele-
vision. 
The 
videotapes 
have 
been 
played over and over and over again to 
dramatize what was happening as peo-
ple were spraying so-called bear spray 
in the faces of law enforcement, beat-
ing them with poles, crashing through 
the windows of the Capitol and break-
ing down the doors to come inside. 
We know what happened after we 
evacuated this Chamber. The mob took 
over. Oh, they had their glory as they 
were taking pictures of one another 
going through our desks here, acting 
like this was a holiday and that they 
were somehow patriots in that shame-
ful moment. 
I questioned whether we needed a 
Commission to establish this. It is 
there. But then last week, there was a 
vivid reminder that, despite reality and 
despite the evidence, there are people 
who want to rewrite history. Let me 
note one in particular. 
Congressman ANDREW CLYDE, Repub-
lican of Georgia, at a House Oversight 
Committee hearing on the January 6 
riot, said that the House floor was not 
breached, that supporters of former 
President Donald Trump who stormed 
the Capitol behaved ‘‘in an orderly 
fashion.’’ Congressman CLYDE went on 
to say that if you looked at the video-
tapes, you could see that ‘‘there was an 
undisciplined mob. There were some ri-
oters, and some who committed acts of 
vandalism.’’ 
Then he went on to say: 
Watching the TV footage of those who en-
tered the Capitol, and walk through Stat-
uary Hall showed people in an orderly fash-
ion staying between the stanchions and 
ropes taking videos and pictures, you know. 
That is what the Congressman said. 
He said: 
If you didn’t know that TV footage was a 
video from January the sixth, you would ac-
tually think it was a normal tourist visit. 
End of quote from Congressman 
CLYDE. 
This is a quote from Congressman 
PAUL GOSAR, Republican from Arizona. 
The law enforcement officials in the 
Capitol were ‘‘harassing peaceful patri-
ots.’’ 
So far, more than 440 people have 
been charged by our government with 
participating in this attack, 440 of Con-
gressman 
CLYDE’s 
orderly 
tourists. 
Many have ties to rightwing extremist 
groups, the FBI said. They recounted 
that five people died in the events that 
led up to the attack. It is outrageous. 
We know President Trump and his 
followers have been pursuing the Big 
Lie when it comes to the results of the 
election. The President has finally em-
barrassed even some Republican fol-
lowers with his extreme statements in 
that regard. But now his loyalists are 
turning on the facts and the videotapes 
and the reality of January 6. 
This has to come to an end. The 
truth has to prevail. This Commission, 
which I understand Senator MCCON-
NELL has now said he opposes, is abso-
lutely necessary—a bipartisan Com-
mission to establish once and for all 
what did occur, as if we have to, but we 
do. Otherwise, Congressman CLYDE, 
Congressman GOSAR, and others will 
set out to rewrite history and blame 
other forces for being at work that day. 
I join Senator SCHUMER in calling for 
the creation of this Commission and 
demanding a vote on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate for its creation so that we 
can establish once and for all what did 
occur on January 6 and must never 
happen again. 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. President, years ago, I traveled 
to Israel with then-minority leader 
Senator Harry Reid. We met with 
Shimon Peres, and something happened 
that I have never forgotten.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2750 
May 19, 2021 
Senator Reid asked: ‘‘What do you 
see as the greatest threat in the world 
to the United States?’’ That was just a 
couple of years after 9/11 when that 
question was posed. I thought Peres 
might cite terrorism or loose nukes. 
Instead, he said without hesitation: 
‘‘China. Don’t you see that?’’ 
Economically, 
strategically, 
dip-
lomatically, China was already focused 
like a laser on advancing its position 
as the world’s most powerful nation, 
and that was 16 years ago. 
Five days ago, China launched a 
spacecraft safely and landed it on 
Mars, becoming only the second nation 
in history, after the United States, to 
land on the Red Planet. 
In 1957, at the height of the Cold War, 
the Soviet Union became the first na-
tion to launch an Earth-orbiting sat-
ellite into space. That launch shocked 
the world and caught us off guard. Our 
response was an unprecedented com-
mitment to reclaim America’s domi-
nance in the world as a leader in sci-
entific and technological discovery and 
innovation. The effort became known 
as America’s Sputnik moment. Twelve 
years later, America put a man on the 
Moon. 
You might say that now, instead of a 
Sputnik moment, America is going 
through a Zhurong moment. That is 
the name of the Chinese Mars rover, 
Zhurong. 
Let me be clear. While China is our 
fastest growing competitor, the United 
States has lost some ground globally as 
many nations recognize the importance 
of R&D investments to their industrial 
innovation and competitiveness. In 
1960, 
just 
3 
years 
after 
Sputnik 
launched, the United States accounted 
for approximately 69 percent of the 
world’s R&D funding. By 2018, 58 years 
later, this percentage had dropped from 
69 percent to 28 percent. Others were 
joining in the pursuit of technology 
and innovation at a record clip. 
The question is, Can we come to-
gether, as Americans did in the last 
century, 
to 
make 
investments 
in 
science, technology, and competitive-
ness to guarantee that America’s econ-
omy remains the world’s largest and 
most innovative? 
Some Members of Congress and the 
Senate—and 
we 
have 
heard 
their 
speeches on the floor—say: Go slow. No 
hurry. Well, I think they are com-
mitted to a solid second-place finish 
for the United States of America, and I 
don’t want to be a part of it. 
The Endless Frontier Act, which we 
are going to consider, gives us a reason 
for hope. It is broad-based. It is bipar-
tisan. It shows leadership by Majority 
Leader CHUCK SCHUMER; Senator TODD 
YOUNG, Republican of Indiana; along 
with 
Commerce 
Committee 
Chair 
MARIA CANTWELL of Washington and 
Ranking Member ROGER
WICKER
of 
Mississippi. 
Like America’s response to Sputnik, 
the new era of scientific and techno-
logical discovery will be driven by seed 
money from the Federal Government, 
but this effort is not limited to govern-
ment spending. America is home to the 
world’s best research colleges and uni-
versities and laboratories, like the Ar-
gonne National Lab in my State of Illi-
nois. They are part of this effort too. 
We will harness the combined efforts of 
America’s best scientific and techno-
logical minds in the public sector and 
the private sector. 
The Endless Frontier Act and broad-
er competitiveness package represent 
the largest investment in U.S. science 
and technology since the Apollo era. It 
will authorize more than $100 billion 
over 5 years to support breakthrough 
scientific discovery and technological 
innovation in 10 key areas vital to 
building an innovation economy for the 
21st century and creating good jobs in 
the process. These key areas include 
fields such as advanced energy, semi-
conductors, artificial intelligence, bio-
technology and genomics, quantum 
computing, robotics, materials science, 
disaster prevention, and, of course, 
cyber security. 
If you need a reminder of why it is 
urgent that we improve U.S. cyber se-
curity, look at how the ransomware at-
tack last week by Russian cyber crimi-
nals on a major American oil pipeline 
caused long gas lines and panic buying 
throughout the eastern half of our 
country. 
Investing strategically in these 10 
key innovation areas will enable the 
United States to protect America’s po-
sition as a leader in the global econ-
omy and protect our national security. 
It will reinvigorate and expand our in-
dustrial and manufacturing base, and 
it will create a stronger middle class in 
our country. 
The Endless Frontier Act will also 
strengthen the security of essential 
supply chains and our ability to solve 
disruptions caused by crises. Remem-
ber those fearless doctors and nurses 
working in COVID–19 wards last year, 
when they had to dress in garbage bags 
because of a nationwide shortage of 
PPE? A nation as wealthy and powerful 
as ours should never be caught so dan-
gerously unprepared. This bill will 
make sure that we aren’t. 
Here 
is 
another 
cautionary 
tale 
about 
supply-line 
disruption. 
In 
Belvidere, IL, which is in the northern 
part of our State, workers at the 
Stellantis plant are proud of their 
work assembling Jeep Cherokees. 
In late March, that plant was forced 
to shut down because of a global short-
age of microchips. The plant is sched-
uled to reopen as soon as the end of 
this month. But late last week, the 
company announced that the plant will 
be forced to shut down one of its two 
production lines in late July, again be-
cause of microchip shortages. As many 
as 1,600 employees could be laid off. 
You can’t build a prosperous econ-
omy and stable middle class if you 
can’t secure your supply lines. We 
know that American workers can build 
cars and trucks for the future because 
they are already doing it, and they are 
going to be launching it in many places 
around our Nation. Just this week, 
President Biden visited an electric ve-
hicle assembly plant in Michigan. And 
they are doing it today as well in Nor-
mal, IL, where a company called 
Rivian—remember the name: R-I-V-I- 
A-N, Rivian—repurposed and expanded 
a former Mitsubishi assembly plant to 
produce the company’s first assembly 
plant for electric cars and trucks. Is 
this going to work? Will it actually 
have a demand for electric vehicles? 
Remember this one too. Amazon has 
already ordered 100,000 delivery vans 
from this plant. By the end of the year, 
Rivian expects to employ 2,500 people 
at the Normal assembly plant, 2,500 
workers in good-paying, middle-class 
jobs in America. The Endless Frontier 
Act and President Biden’s American 
Jobs Plan provides the leadership and 
resources to make sure that America 
remains the world leader in the 21st 
century. 
On another critical issue, let me say 
that we need to get serious when it 
comes to combating intellectual prop-
erty theft and counterfeiting. The pre-
vious administration’s policies were 
haphazard. We can do better. The End-
less Frontier Act will impose tough 
sanctions on entities that violate U.S. 
intellectual property and trade protec-
tions. 
I am working with Senator CASSIDY, 
a Republican from Louisiana, and oth-
ers on a bipartisan bill that provides 
additional safeguards to combat the 
sale of counterfeit goods, especially on 
the internet. 
As I said, the Endless Frontier Act 
and competitiveness package will in-
vest more than $100 billion over 5 years 
to support breakthrough technologies. 
Now, $100 billion is a big investment, 
but it is dramatically less than what 
China is now spending in the same 
areas. And it is far less when adjusted 
for inflation than what we spent on the 
race for space. 
If we contributed the same share of 
our GDP to science and technology 
today as we did in the early 1960s—1 
percent of our overall economy—we 
would have to spend $900 billion, not 
$100 billion, in this effort. 
My support for the Endless Frontier 
Act builds on my commitment to se-
curing steady, predictable funding in-
creases for so many research Agencies 
of the Federal Government but espe-
cially for NIH. They provided the life-
saving vaccines that allow us to take 
off our masks and resume our lives. 
Monday, I went out to NIH with sev-
eral of my colleagues. Senator BLUNT 
led a group from the Appropriations 
Committee. We met with NIH Director 
Francis Collins, Dr. Anthony Fauci, 
and scientists who are working on 
breakthrough discoveries. 
It was 6 years ago that Senator ROY 
BLUNT, Republican from Missouri, and 
I made an informal pact. We worked to-
gether to increase the NIH budget by 5 
percent a year over and above infla-
tion. With the help of Senator PATTY

MURRAY and LAMAR ALEXANDER, we in-
creased the NIH budget more than 40 
percent. 
Because of those modest investments 
and the genius of NIH-funded research-
ers, we have a real chance of devel-
oping better treatments and cures for 
terrible diseases, including cancers, 
sickle cell, and Alzheimer’s. 
The race for the future isn’t an ei-

invest 
in 
science or breakthrough technologies. 
We have to invest in both. I will con-
tinue to work with Senators from both 
parties to preserve steady, predictable 
funding increases for research. 
No one bill will safeguard our na-
tional security or resolve all of our 
outstanding issues with China. We still 
have a lot of work to do, both in Con-
gress and diplomatically. We still have 
to strengthen our immigration system 
so that America continues to welcome 
immigrants who want to put their ge-
nius to work for the good of America, 
as Nikola Tesla and Albert Einstein did 
in the last century, as did Katalin 
Kariko, the Hungarian-born Nobel lau-
reate whose NIH-funded research paved 
the way for today’s COVID vaccines. 
Strengthening America’s role as a 
global leader in science and technology 
is an essential piece of our effort to 
preserving our leadership in the world. 
For that reason, I support the Endless 
Frontier Act, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Wyoming. 
ISRAEL 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, on 
the way over to the floor, I received a 
CNN news alert, and the headline is: 
‘‘Biden dramatically scales up the pres-
sure on Netanyahu.’’ 
So I come to the floor to tell you and 
to tell the Nation that I stand with 
Israel. Like millions of Americans, I 
have been disturbed to see the Biden 
administration make a false equiva-
lence between Israel and the terrorist 
group Hamas. There is no equivalence 
here. 
Hamas is a terrorist group funded by 
Iran. These terrorists have fired over 
3,000 missiles into population centers 
in Israel. Israel has every right to de-
fend itself. If Hamas stopped fighting, 
there would be peace. If Israel stopped 
fighting, there would be no peace. 
Hamas would continue to attack Israel. 
President Biden’s readout of his call 
this morning with Prime Minister 
Netanyahu stated: 
The president conveyed to the prime min-
ister that he expected a significant de-esca-
lation today on the path to a ceasefire. 
President Biden doesn’t get to tell 
Israel what to do. We all want peace. 
We all want a cease-fire. A cease-fire 
happens when Hamas stops its terrorist 
campaign. Until then, Israel has every 
right to the proportional response it is 
making right now. Israel has every 
right to take out the terrorist leaders 
that are directing the attacks on its 
citizens. 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Mr. President, I would like to move 
now to a separate topic, and the one for 
which I originally came to the floor, 
and I came to the floor to talk about 
our economy. 
In April, the unemployment rate 
went up. Surprisingly, it went up. It 
was supposed to go down. It went up, 
and so are prices all around the coun-
try. The experts in the White House ac-
tually thought that we were going to 
add 1 million new workers in America 
last month. In reality, only about 
266,000 Americans went back to work. 
So the so-called experts at the White 
House were wrong, and they were 
wrong by three-quarters of a million 
workers. 
Now, 40,000 of those people who went 
back to work went to government jobs, 
which means the cost of government 
continues to grow. The private sector 
was able to only hire 220,000 people 
rather than 1 million. It was the most 
disappointing jobs report in over 20 
years. 
There has also been a slowdown in 
the middle of a recovery, which is sur-
prising to many. You know, before Joe 
Biden took office, we saw a fantastic 
economic recovery, and it was the fast-
est one in American history. We were 
bouncing back from the coronavirus 
shutdown. It is a very different story 
now. It is no coincidence that this is a 
direct result of President Biden’s poli-
cies. 
And the policies—the Democrats all 
voted for this, and the Republicans all 
voted against it. The Democrats and 
President Biden, party-line vote, voted 
to extend a bonus payment for workers 
to stay home, paying people more to 
stay at home than they could make at 
work, in many cases. People aren’t 
lazy. They are logical, and it is a per-
fectly logical thing to do; that they 
took up the President on his offer to 
stay home when they were paid more 
to stay home than they could make at 
work. 
So, as a result, job openings right 
now are at an alltime high. Businesses 
can’t find workers. Everywhere I go in 
Wyoming, I see ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs. 
The president of Delta Airlines re-
ported they canceled 100 flights last 
month 
because 
they 
couldn’t 
find 
enough people to work. They had peo-
ple ready to fly. They didn’t have peo-
ple who were ready to work. 
People want to work. People want to 
hire others. The incentives coming 
from government are absolutely wrong. 
Joe Biden and Big Government are get-
ting in the way of people returning to 
work. 
There is another big problem I heard 
about. I heard about it this past week-
end in Wyoming. The business owners I 
heard can’t find workers because of in-
centives coming out of this administra-
tion—‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs up—and 
from other people asking me: Why are 
prices going up? Why is inflation back? 
You know, under the Obama-Biden 
administration, we saw the same thing. 
It is called the middle-class squeeze, 
where prices are going up faster than 
wages are going up. April was the worst 
month for inflation since the great re-
cession 13 years ago. 
In effect, inflation means that the 
money in your wallet buys less. So, in 
a sense, you have a pay cut. Inflation is 
a regressive tax. It means the poorer 
you are, the more it hurts and the 
fewer things you can buy for the 
money you have. The big donors in the 
Democratic league, they are going to 
be just fine. They won’t even notice 
rising prices. They don’t notice when 
gas prices go up. The Silicon Valley 
hotshots and the masters of the uni-
verse in Manhattan, they are going to 
be just fine. 
It is families—working families in 
Wyoming and New Mexico and across 
the country who are struggling to get 
by. They are the ones who are going to 
get hurt the most. Just look at the 
cost of a trip to the grocery store. 
First, you have to go to the grocery 
store, and to you get there, you have to 
drive. Well, the price of gasoline is 
going up. Across the Nation now, the 
price of a gallon of gasoline is over $3 
a gallon. A year ago, it was about $2 a 
gallon. 
Since Joe Biden took office, it has 
gone up nearly 70 cents a gallon. That 
hits people when they fill up because 
they have to drive getting back to 
work. In Wyoming and New Mexico, 
people drive long distances, and we use 
more gas than most. So people in our 
States are paying more than many 
other places. 
And I don’t think it is a coincidence 
that the price of gas has gone up. Joe 
Biden’s first action in office was to 
draw a target on the back of American 
energy and pull the trigger. He shut 
down the Keystone XL Pipeline. He 
banned new oil and gas leases on Fed-
eral lands. He has restricted the pro-
duction of American energy. We need 
energy. We need it now. 
Gas prices affect the price of every-
thing else. It costs more and more to 
transport things across the country, 
and that is why we are seeing prices go 
up at the grocery store. Working fami-
lies are getting squeezed. And this is a 
direct result of the policies of the 
Biden administration. 
One reason this is happening is be-
cause President Biden is flooding the 
country with so-called easy money. We 
are finding out it is not too easy. In the 
month 
of 
March, 
President 
Biden 
signed into law a $2 trillion slush fund 
for basically liberal spending. It was 
described as a coronavirus relief pack-
age but, in fact, when you take a look 
at it, less than 9 percent of the money, 
a very small percentage of the money, 
actually went for medical care. 
He crammed it through Congress— 
party-line vote, absolutely no Repub-
lican support—put the bill on the Na-
tion’s credit card, and the Federal Re-
serve started to print more money. 
Now, money doesn’t grow on trees, 
doesn’t come from a printer, and you

cannot print your way to prosperity. 
The money has to come from some-
where. 
History shows that this is a strategy 
that eventually backfires. Nations try 
to print free money, and they end up 
poorer than ever. Get-rich schemes 
don’t work, never have, and they aren’t 
going to this time either. Inflation is 
going up every single month since the 
election. 
Now, the White House experts tell us 
not to worry. These are the same ex-
perts that predicted there would be 1 
million new jobs and people working 
last month and that the unemployment 
rate would drop. But much of the $2 
trillion that President Biden signed 
into law hasn’t even gone out the door 
yet, and the President is asking for 
trillions and trillions more. 
The House of Representatives, the 
other night, put out a proposal related 
to the infrastructure bill, one that I 
am trying to work with the adminis-
tration on. They are requesting $7.1 
trillion, an astonishingly high amount 
of money. If the President gets his way 
and we keep spending like this at the 
request from the House, inflation is 
only beginning. 
You don’t have to take my word for 
it. Listen to the liberal economist 
Larry Summers. He was in the Clinton 
administration as well as the Obama 
administration. He was Clinton’s Sec-
retary of the Treasury and played an 
economic role in the Obama adminis-
tration. 
He warned against President Biden’s 
spending spree. He called that $2 tril-
lion slush fund the least responsible 
spending bill he has seen in four dec-
ades—the least responsible spending 
bill in four decades. That is before all 
this additional spending may be com-
ing. 
Well, this is what he said after 
April’s inflation numbers came out. He 
said: 
I was . . . worried . . . about inflation . . . 
[yet] it’s . . . moved much faster, much soon-
er than [even] I . . . predicted. 
That is Larry Summers—Clinton ad-
ministration and Obama administra-
tion—commenting on the Biden poli-
cies. 
People who save money their whole 
lives for retirement are now watching 
their hard-earned savings go down with 
a stroke of Joe Biden’s pen. Their buy-
ing ability is shrinking. People who did 
the right thing, who worked hard, and 
saved their money are now being pun-
ished by Biden policies. 
Under President Biden, we are seeing 
more government, more taxes, more 
spending, and, as a result, the Amer-
ican people are suffering. They are see-
ing flat wages, higher prices, and dis-
appointing job creation. We see gas 
lines. We see people hoarding gasoline. 
It sounds like it was in the 1970s. And 
President 
Biden 
should 
remember 
those times because he was still a 
Member of the Senate back then. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to continue and finish my remarks 
with an additional 60 seconds. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
President Biden should remember 
that by 1980, the American people had 
had enough. We changed course. We 
thought it was enough of Jimmy Car-
ter, and we elected Ronald Reagan 
President. 
It is time to change course again. 
Let’s create more American energy. 
Let’s set down the taxpayer’s credit 
card. Put it away. Cut up the credit 
card. Stop the reckless spending. 
American families have been paying 
the price. The people in the middle are 
being squeezed. The American people 
expect and deserve better. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we 
come to the floor today after a lot of 
hard work by the Commerce Com-
mittee to pass out the Endless Frontier 
bill last week—24 to 4. I know my col-
leagues from the committee will be out 
here to speak on this important legis-
lation, as will the majority leader, Sen-
ator SCHUMER, who authored this im-
portant legislation, and our colleague 
from 
Indiana, 
Senator 
YOUNG. 
We 
thank them for kick-starting what is a 
very important national discussion 
about how much we should be investing 
in research and development or what I 
would say is American ingenuity or, to 
put it a little more simply, I just say 
American know-how, because we are a 
nation of people who know how to in-
novate, who know how to use science 
to transform our economy, and we have 
done it over and over and over again. 
I don’t know. Maybe it came with, in

May 19, 2021 
way across the ocean, you had to be an 
adventurer to begin with. If you had to 
settle the frontier, you had to be inno-
vative in your own right. If you had to 
continue to expand our country, you 
had to have a great ability to take 
risks in order to calculate and move 
forward. 
Yet, somehow, in the United States 
of America, we are blessed with inge-
nuity in our DNA. We as a nation are a 
nation that has figured out that if we 
continue to partner together with 
those great, creative minds, that the 
investment by both the public sector 
and the private sector and through our 
universities and now our community 
colleges and now research centers— 
that we can grow our economy, com-
pete on an international level, and pro-
tect opportunity for future Americans. 
So it has been many eras of innova-
tion. When I think about it, I think 
about Thomas Edison and the light 
bulb, I obviously think about Henry 
Ford and automobiles, and in my part 
of the world, we think about Bill Boe-
ing and aviation. Innovation is so 
much part of our DNA that I don’t 
think we sometimes absorb the littler 
things that we might not know about. 
People probably don’t know about 
Nathan Stone Stubblefield, a Kentucky 
inventor who in 1902 demonstrated the 
first wireless transmission of commu-
nication using magnets. I know we 
have a big wireless industry today, but 
people probably don’t know that, in 
1902, a Kentucky inventor basically 
helped to turn the page on a new gen-
eration of technology. People probably 
don’t know that a Louisiana professor, 
J. Lawrence Smith, in 1850, invented 
the microscope. Think about how much 
that led to the important discussions 
of science and healthcare for us as a 
nation. People probably don’t know 
that, in Indiana, a State police officer 
invented the breathalyzer test, a gen-
tleman named Robert Borkenstein, 
who basically just said, ‘‘We don’t 
know what is happening here,’’ and he 
introduced 
and 
created 
the 
breathalyzer test. 
That is what America is. America is 
the spirit of know-how and getting 
things done. 
In fact, a report read: 
Americans prioritize being a world leader 
in scientific achievements more than other 
global [communities]. 
That is from the Pew Research Cen-
ter report by Cary Funk and several 
other authors last September. 
The report goes on to read: 
[S]even in ten Americans believe it is very 
important for the United States to be a lead-
er in scientific achievements. 
Clearly, what makes us different 
than other nations is that we are will-
ing to put significant American tax 
dollars on the table to ensure that the 
national investment, the research in 
science, and the development of our 
ecosystem take place. That investment 
is matched with a good education sys-
tem, capital formation, and, as I said, 
private sector investments in research 
and development. All of that has con-
tinued to make us the world leader in 
science and technology innovation. It 
also helps us create job growth here at 
home. 
The question before us today is, How 
much research and development should 
our government be doing given how im-
portant the practical sciences and engi-
neering are to the next generation of 
Americans? 
We are here to discuss this proposal 
by Senators SCHUMER and YOUNG, who, 
as I said, have been working on this 
concept for years because, no doubt, we 
have fallen off the pace—that is to say, 
the pace of scientific research invest-
ment at least as a percentage of the 
GDP. 
Even though President Bush, in his 
second term, tried to signal the impor-
tance of this investment, he issued a 
report basically calling the American 
Competitiveness Initiative the leading 
world innovation agenda. That was in 
February of 2006. 
In fact, at that time, President Bush 
said: 
[T]he role of government is not to create 
wealth; the role of our government is to cre-
ate an environment in which the entre-
preneur can flourish, in which minds can ex-
pand, in which technologies can reach new 
frontiers. 
George Bush had it right. He knew 
that this competitiveness issue was 
starting to challenge us from a com-
petitive perspective, and he knew that 
we needed to make a bigger invest-
ment. 
Unfortunately, with the two at-
tempts that we had—the America 
COMPETES Act in 2007 and the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act in 2010—it really 
was a goal by us to basically double the 
NSF budget within a 7-year window. 
While we started out in the right direc-
tion, we had a huge economic down-
turn, and these goals were not met. If 
we had kept our promises to these 
science agencies, we would have in-
vested $80 billion more in innovation 
investments over the last 14 years than 
we have done today. 
The challenge that we face now is 
that, after decades of not living up to 
what had been outlined for America 
COMPETES, we now know that it is an 
environment in which we are facing 
much more aggressive competition. We 
have to think about the lack of invest-
ment that we did not realize in the 
context of how long it takes to do tech-
nology breakthroughs. 
Look at just one example, the inter-
net as we know it today. Literally, in 
the 1960s, the ARPANET was first 
talked about. It took us to the 1990s to 
really, with the University of Illinois 
and Marc Andreessen, to affect what 
we would later know as hypertext links 
and a browser. Today, what it means to 
us is more than $2 trillion annually to 
our economy. 
When you think about the invest-
ments we are asking our colleagues to 
make today, we have to consider that, 
in fact, Federal dollars for R&D is near 
its lowest point in 60 years as a per-
centage of the GDP. I can’t say that we 
are going to discover the next internet, 
but I can say that, if we continue to 
underinvest in this, we will be short-
changing generations of innovation. 
There is no doubt that key invest-
ments in research and development in 
other parts of the world are certainly 
getting attention. Since 2000, research 
and development in China has grown 
by 1,600 percent; in Taiwan and Korea 
by 400 percent; while, in the United 
States, just by 150 percent. That is in a 
20-year window of looking at this issue. 
Americans believe that competition 
is good, and we believe that competi-
tion helps to drive innovation. So you 
won’t find me as one on the floor who 
is obsessed about other nations as 
much as giving a perspective here 
about what the world market oppor-
tunity represents. If we are not making 
the investments here in science and 
technology and innovation, not only 
are we missing opportunities in our 
own country, we are missing opportu-
nities around the globe. The rest of the 
Nation, in an information age, is not 
going to sit by idly, so we have to 
think about how we move ahead on 
critical technology that helps us in all 
sectors of our economy—how it helps 
us with supply chains and, certainly, 
how it helps us with national security. 
What we are talking about here, with 
this bill proposed by our colleague 
Leader SCHUMER and Senator YOUNG, is 
more than a doubling of NSF’s budget 
in 5 years; it is the start of trying to 
catch up. It is also a $17 billion invest-
ment in energy innovation—a key sec-
tor of our economy in which we need to 
make continued transformation. That 
represents a 28-percent increase in 
some of the projects from the Office of 
Science and things like ARPA-E that 
could see investment. 
What we are also investing in, which 
our colleagues were very adamant 
about and very convincing, is a new 
tech directorate—that is to say that 
our research is very good with basic 
and very good with applied but that we 
actually have to get better with the 
user implementation of our science and 
spur more innovation in a more rapid 
fashion. So we are investing, between 
this new tech directorate and tech 
hubs, nearly $39 billion to help stimu-
late the faster translation of our ad-
vancements into real innovation. This 
is something the committee thought 
long and hard about, and we took testi-
mony from experts who have worked 
on innovation issues for many years. 
In this bill, we also increase the pro-
tection of intellectual property from 
our universities. 
We are helping our universities do 
better tech transfer but also protect 
their intellectual property. In an infor-
mation age, when so much is published 
online, if other nations, hungry for de-
velopment, can read our research and 
act an effect on it because we haven’t 
patented it, then we need to do a better 
job of patenting our innovations and 
helping our universities.

S2754 
May 19, 2021 
Our universities are unbelievable re-
search institutions, and helping them 
spend more time on tech transfer is 
something that we have done in the 
Pacific Northwest. A new program ush-
ered in there literally led to 20 startups 
from research that had been done but 
just hadn’t been translated into new 
areas. 
We also are trying to help get more 
regional diversity to our research and 
investment dollars. There are about 25 
States in our Nation that previously 
qualified for a program that says they 
should get a share of research dollars. 
This legislation says all the money 
being spent here, 20 percent of it should 
go to that, what is called EPSCoR ef-
forts, which is expanding research and 
development into those States. 
And for the first time, we will have 
over at NSF an office of diversity—an 
office to focus on the lack of women 
and minorities in science and to make 
real progress on this issue. 
People see the chart behind me, and, 
yes, it is no mistake, the picture we 
picked. 
The point here is that we know from 
NSF’s own research that we can’t be 
passive about this. Literally, the Uni-
versity of Washington got an NSF 
grant that helped them study why we 
are not making more progress with 
women and minorities in science and 
innovation, and they came back with: 
It can’t be passive. You can’t just put 
dollars on the table for STEM. You 
can’t just put a few programs in place. 
It has to be an active approach to 
changing many aspects to the way we 
educate in science. 
I am very proud of the University of 
Washington on this point because they 
made changes, and now of those who 
are teaching in what are considered 
STEM sciences at the University of 
Washington, 70 percent of them are 
women or people of color. So we have 
changed what the face of teaching 
science looks like at the University of 
Washington, and now we have to 
change some of the criteria and cur-
riculum so that we can continue to at-
tract more people. This bill is a very 
good step in that direction. 
So what are we trying to achieve? We 
are trying to achieve what NSF Direc-
tor Panchanathan is saying. He is say-
ing that we need, in this next decade 
and in decades to come, innovation ev-
erywhere, tied to opportunity every-
where, tied to our universities. That is 
what we are trying to do in advancing 
this legislation. 
We processed over 100 amendments in 
committee and a broad range of input 
from our colleagues. We will, I am sure, 
here in regular order process many 
more, but, hopefully, these amend-
ments and more of the substance of 
this underlying bill we will go into in 
detail. We have to remember what our 
goals are with this investment—to stay 
competitive, to create future jobs, to 
help our economy by unleashing inno-
vation, to protect our national secu-
rity, and do what Americans know how 
to do best—that is, use that ingenuity 
to help create a better future. 
I will see if my colleagues want to 
speak, but we will be coming back to 
expand on many other layers of this 
legislation. We will be back to talk 
about semiconductors. We will be back 
to talk about the new tech directorate. 
We will be back to talk about NASA 
funding. We will be back. 
And that reminds me. If anybody at 
home is saying, ‘‘Well, you know, OK, 
that was interesting; I don’t really 
know about this; what is American in-
novation?’’ just go and Google two 
things. You can either look at SpaceX 
rocket return, which they did in 2015, 
or Blue Origin. In both of those—the 
New Shepherd and the Falcon, two dif-
ferent approaches—there are literally 
engineers who said: If we are going to 
go to space, if we are going to go to the 
Moon, if we are going back to the Moon 
and go to Mars, we need to figure out 
how to have returnable rockets. 
Just go Google those two clips, and 
you will see alive and well the spirit of 
American ingenuity when those engi-
neers see that rocket returning from 
outer space and reland because they 
have pulled off an incredible achieve-
ment. You will see jubilant joy and ex-
citement over that accomplishment. 
I guarantee you, we will not see ev-
erything that this bill will unleash, but 
I guarantee you it will unleash things 
that will deliver that kind of excite-
ment for Americans in the future, and 
we will have to be very thankful that 
this Congress set the record straight on 
the level of investment we need to 
achieve to keep us competitive. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, the 21st 
century will be shaped by the outcome 
of the strategic competition between 
the United States and China. Like our 
Nation’s previous contest with the So-
viet Union, the outcome of this great 
contest will help determine the world 
that our children and our grand-
children live in. 
There are only two real possibilities: 
Either the United States will remain 
the preeminent global superpower or 
we will be replaced by China. This 
truth is recognized on both sides of the 
aisle in this body. The contest between 
our two countries will involve every as-
pect of national life—including mili-
tary might, diplomatic skill, economic 
strength, and the deepest values that 
shape our societies. 
The scope and complexity of this 
challenge calls for bold action, and 
that is what the Endless Frontier Act 
is about. This week the Senate has an 
opportunity to come together on a bi-
partisan basis and move forward on 
legislation, now known as the United 
States Innovation and Competition 
Act. This will make our Nation more 
economically 
competitive, 
improve 
protections for U.S. intellectual prop-
erty and research, and keep us a step 
ahead of China in this area of high- 
stakes competition. 
This bill does so by increasing re-
search at the National Science Founda-
tion and dramatically increasing R&D 
at a new National Science Foundation 
directorate. Other Agencies in the Fed-
eral Government will also see dramatic 
increases in the important research 
that they perform. 
The Endless Frontier Act, as re-
ported by the Commerce Committee, is 
a major part of this comprehensive leg-
islative effort. Other committees have 
also been important partners in this 
legislation. In particular, I congratu-
late Chairman MENENDEZ and Ranking 
Member RISCH of the Foreign Relations 
Committee for producing the Strategic 
Competition Act, which was reported 
out of their committee on a 21-to-1 
vote. 
I also commend Homeland Security 
and Governmental Affairs Chairman 
PETERS
and 
Ranking 
Member 
PORTMAN; Banking Committee Chair-
man BROWN
and Ranking Member 
TOOMEY; Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions Committee Chair MURRAY 
and Ranking Member BURR; and Judi-
ciary Chair DURBIN and Ranking Mem-
ber GRASSLEY for their important con-
tributions to the substitute product. 
I will focus my remarks on the Com-
merce Committee’s contributions to 
the Endless Frontier Act. Last week, 
the Commerce Committee held a mark-
up to consider this legislation. We con-
sidered hundreds of amendments and 
adopted over 100 of them into the re-
ported bill, including over 20 bipar-
tisan, separately introduced bills. The 
markup at times was challenging, but 
in the end the bill passed the com-
mittee on a bipartisan 24-to-4 vote. 
The Endless Frontier Act will en-
hance U.S. science and technology 
leadership through key investments in 
R&D, regional economic development, 
and manufacturing. 
The bill will accomplish these goals 
in the following ways: First, it will pre-
serve the core basic research mission of 
the National Science Foundation. The 
NSF is the world’s gold standard for 
funding basic research, a sector that 
fuels new waves of innovation across 
our society. Basic research answers the 
fundamental questions of scientific in-
quiry needed to develop major innova-
tions. The internet, GPS, cell phones, 
and many other breakthrough tech-
nologies have their origins in National 
Science Foundation-funded research. 
The Endless Frontier Act will author-
ize funding increases in NSF’s core 
science portfolio to support the most 
promising research proposals. That is 
the first thing. 
Secondly, this bill will establish a 
new Directorate of Technology and In-
novation at the NSF to drive faster in-
novation 
in 
key 
technology 
focus 
areas, such as artificial intelligence, or 
AI, and robotics. We included strong 
coordination measures to ensure that 
programs at the new Technology Direc-
torate do not duplicate R&D programs 
of other Federal Agencies, such as the 
Department of Energy. These provi-
sions are designed to ensure the wise

expenditure of taxpayer dollars by pre-
venting bureaucratic turf wars, which 
can slow down innovation. 
Third, this legislation will protect in-
tellectual property and research from 
foreign 
governments—most 
notably, 
China. The Endless Frontier Act will 
establish a research security office at 
the NSF and create a clearinghouse to 
share information about security risks. 
It also puts forward policies to protect 
controlled information, including a 
plan for background checks on re-
searchers. 
In addition, it will take critical steps 
to guard against Chinese intellectual 
property theft by prohibiting NSF 
funds from going to researchers who 
are part of a Chinese talent program or 
an institution with formal ties to a 
Confucius Institute. This is a new and 
important step. 
Fourth, this bill will reduce the geo-
graphic concentration of R&D in a 
handful of States and universities. Put 
simply, this bill will be a game changer 
for the R&D geographic diversity that 
many of us have sought for years, if 
not decades. America can maintain our 
leadership over China only with a sus-
tained effort that is national in scope. 
We should tap into the wide-ranging 
talents, expertise, and capabilities of 
Americans across this land, including 
Nevada and Mississippi. 
The Endless Frontier Act will help 
address these long-standing disparities 
by increasing funding for the Estab-
lished Program to Stimulate Competi-
tive Research, which we have all come 
to know as EPSCoR. Participation in 
EPSCoR helps institutions in many 
States and Territories improve their 
research 
capacities 
and, 
therefore, 
compete more effectively for Federal 
R&D funding. The legislation also in-
vests in minority serving institutions 
and builds up research capacity in 
emerging institutions, which have tra-
ditionally received a relatively small 
share of Federal research dollars. 
No. 5, this bill will boost regional 
economic development through the Re-
gional Technology Hub Program. 
No. 6, it will support manufacturing 
programs, in part, by quadrupling the 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership 
Program, which already exists. 
No. 7, it will help America win the 
‘‘New Space Race’’ against China by in-
cluding the NASA Authorization Act, 
which the Senate passed unanimously 
last year. The NASA bill allows Con-
gress to set priorities and guardrails 
for the space Agency’s exploration and 
research programs. 
No. 8, this bill will authorize a num-
ber of telecommunication programs to 
improve our telecom workforce and 
help get all Americans connected to 
high-speed and reliable broadband. 
This bill also includes several bills 
that I have championed, including the 
Rural STEM Education Act, the Ad-
vanced Technological Manufacturing 
Act, the Improving Minority Participa-
tion and Careers in Telecommuni-
cations Act, and the Telecommuni-
cations Supply Chain Diversity Pro-
motion Act—significant legislation and 
a mouthful, too. 
Overall, this is a strong bill, but it 
can be made better. As I mentioned at 
the Commerce Committee’s markup 
last week, although the bill reported 
out of the committee makes important 
changes to the underlying bill, I regret 
the rushed process that was followed. 
The underlying bill was introduced 
on April 20, just under a month ago. 
Only yesterday, Senate Majority Lead-
er SCHUMER laid down a 1,400-page sub-
stitute that not only includes the End-
less Frontier Act, but major legislation 
from the Foreign Relations, Homeland 
Security, Banking, HELP, and Judici-
ary Committees. Now known as the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act— 
USICA, I suppose—this legislation will 
make significant changes to our inno-
vation ecosystem and the missions of 
our Federal Agencies. 
A bill of this magnitude would nor-
mally take a year to write and involve 
soliciting input from Members and 
stakeholders across our country to 
craft a consensus package. Clearly, the 
Senate should consider this bill with 
an open amendment process. 
Prematurely shutting down debate 
on amendments without this open 
process would send a false signal to 
China and the American people that we 
are divided in an area where, actually, 
we are united and together. 
And then, when all is said and done, 
the effort will have to be paid for and 
will be subject to appropriations. 
I hope the majority’s determination 
to rush this legislation through the 
Senate is not designed to use a par-
tisan reconciliation bill to appropriate 
funding for these important initiatives. 
Science has always been debated in a 
bipartisan way in this body. Leaving 
one party on the sidelines in the appro-
priation process, which I hope will not 
happen, would have a detrimental con-
sequences for the long-term stability of 
this legislation. 
So on the whole, I am positive and 
optimistic about this bill and about the 
process that will get us to the end of 
both parties’ desire. 
I thank my colleague, Senator CANT-
WELL, for her work as chair of the Com-
merce Committee to get this bill on 
the floor today, and I look forward to 
working with her to improve the bill in 
the next step in the process—an open 
amendment process

ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

WORKER SHORTAGE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to give short remarks on three 
different subjects. Probably, for people 
wanting to speak, it will take me about 
10 or 12 minutes. 
Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, ef-
fective vaccines are available on de-
mand to anyone who wants to take the 
shot. That means individuals and busi-
nesses are beginning to return to a de-
gree of normalcy we have all been wait-
ing for. 
However, as I have made my annual 
tour through Iowa’s 99 counties, I have 
heard from business after business that 
they are desperate for workers, but job 
applicants are scarce. Those that do 
apply often don’t show up for inter-
views. 
Nationally, the economy added over 
700,000 fewer jobs than were expected 
last month. This is very concerning, as 
a vibrant labor market is vital—vital— 
to a strong economy. 
I get that some individuals, even 
after being vaccinated, may be leery of 
returning to the market after a year of 
staying home to be safe, but the vac-
cines have been shown to virtually 
eliminate the chance of serious illness. 
Hopefully, the recent CDC guidelines 
that reinforce this by easing mask 
guidelines will reassure individuals 
that it is safe to return to work. 
However, Iowa employers repeatedly 
informed me that the biggest impedi-
ment to finding workers is the over- 
the-top 
unemployment 
benefits 
ex-
tended as part of President Biden’s so- 
called COVID relief bill. 
I had 13 county meetings throughout 
Iowa during our last Senate recess, and 
in all but one of them, this came up as 
a very important issue. 
The simple fact is this: Under that 
partisan COVID package, many indi-
viduals can earn more if they don’t 
work than if they do work. That is 
wrong in principle and has proven dis-
astrous in practice, and, as a matter of 
fact, in American society, a job is very 
essential and center to the quality of 
life. 
As my Republican colleagues and I 
have warned for months, incentives 
matter. If you can earn more not work-
ing than working, it makes perfect 
sense not to work. I don’t blame work-
ers for taking that deal. I blame gov-
ernment policy that puts the indi-
vidual workers in this predicament. 
Even prominent liberal economists 
have acknowledged a problem with

continuing to provide increased unem-
ployment benefits. For instance, Presi-
dent Obama’s former chief economic 
adviser, Jason Furman, admitted that 
if he were in a low unemployment 
State, he would be—these are his 
quotes—‘‘thinking 
seriously 
about 
whether paying people more to not 
work than to work was a good thing to 
continue doing.’’ 
This is the case in Iowa, which has an 
unemployment rate of 3.7 percent. That 
is low even in normal times, but it 
should be even lower as Iowa has more 
job openings than unemployed people. 
I stand firmly behind Governor Rey-
nolds, who recently announced Iowa 
would end its participation in the 
counterproductive 
enhanced 
benefit 
program, and that ending will be effec-
tive June 12. 
President Biden talks about the gov-
ernment creating jobs by spending tril-
lions of borrowed dollars, all while 
spending more borrowed money to pay 
people not to work. Now, that fails the 
commonsense test. 
In Iowa, the private sector is already 
creating more jobs than we can fill. 
The economy is poised to take off if the 
government just gets out of the way. 
Politicians should live by the same 
principle as doctors: ‘‘First, do no 
harm.’’ 
We shouldn’t continue pandemic-era 
policies longer than they are nec-
essary. That will only slow our eco-
nomic recovery. Just as the CDC up-
dated its guidance based upon the new 
reality about masks and about the vac-
cine, it is time for Congress to conform 
its policies to the conditions on the 
ground. 
PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. President, on another subject, 
yesterday I participated on a call with 
Canadian counterparts that serve in 
Canada’s Parliament. 
Just for a little background on these 
meetings, until the pandemic or until 
people got so busy they couldn’t travel 
back and forth between the two coun-
tries, over a period of more than a half 
a century, there have been meetings of 
Canadian Parliamentarians and Mem-
bers of the American Congress on an 
annual basis. 
One time, the U.S. Congressmen 
would go to some place in Canada; the 
next year, the Canadian Parliamentar-
ians would come down here. 
In the recent 5 to 10 years, this has 
been done more like yesterday by 
Zoom or by a few people from Canada 
coming down here more often than we 
went up there. 
But over the period of my years in 
the U.S. Senate, I presume I have par-
ticipated in at least 15 of those meet-
ings where we travel back and forth, 
and I found them very helpful in talk-
ing about problems between the two 
countries. The problem is, it is almost 
laughable that we have very many 
problems between Canada and the 
United States. So we would end up 
talking about two or three issues, but 
they were problems that had to be 
worked out. 
So we had this meeting yesterday by 
Zoom, as I just said. We discussed 
issues of concern that impact both leg-
islative bodies in our respective coun-
tries. 
Canada and the United States share 
the same values and are closely tied to 
each other culturally and economi-
cally. Canada is our closest ally. We 
need to effectively work with Canada 
and Canadians on issues that impact 
both countries. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden made a hasty decision to shut 
down the construction of the Keystone 
XL Pipeline—a decision that cost the 
United States and Canada over 10,000 
jobs. 
This decision by President Biden sent 
a clear signal to other democratic 
countries across the globe. That mes-
sage is, it doesn’t matter if it will cost 
your State jobs and raise gas prices or 
irritate an ally; you would be better to 
listen to ideologues in your party who 
say something like this: Pipelines that 
transport oil are bad. 
But while the Keystone XL Pipeline 
is better known, the Canadians who 
were meeting yesterday were worried 
about the current pipeline in use that 
goes by the name of Enbridge Line 5. 
The pipeline, which has been in use 
since 1953, delivers the bulk of Cana-
dian crude exports to the United States 
and also supplies fuel to Ontario and 
Quebec. 
In June of 2019, the State of Michigan 
filed a lawsuit to compel the decom-
missioning of the segment of Line 5 
that runs under Lake Michigan. The 
basis of the suit is that the pipeline is 
a public nuisance that could become a 
source of pollution if it leaks. This 
month, the Canadian Government filed 
a request to stop the State of Michigan 
from shutting down the pipeline. 
Shutting down the pipeline would 
have an immediate effect on crude oil 
supplies for refineries and, as a result, 
increase the price of gas for Americans. 
We saw it over the past 7 or 8 days, how 
the Colonial Pipeline’s shutdown has 
increased the price of gas—if you could 
buy gas. So we ought to be thinking 
about these problems. 
For the sake of North American en-
ergy independence and for American 
jobs and to mend relations with our 
closest allies, I am asking the Gov-
ernor of Michigan to reconsider this 
lawsuit. For that matter, President 
Biden ought to step in and the entire 
Democratic Party ought to reconsider 
their stance on the use of pipelines. 
Take a cue from the former Governor 
of Michigan, now Energy Secretary 
Granholm, who said pipelines are ‘‘the 
best way to move oil.’’ 
INSPECTOR GENERAL’S ACT OF 1978 
Mr. President, my last comment, 
which will be very short, deals with the 
subject of the Inspector General’s Act 
of 1978. 
When we passed that act, we required 
a President who wants to remove an IG 
to provide Congress specific reasons 
why that IG was removed. When Con-
gress revised the IG act 30 years later, 
we amended that notification require-
ment and made it even stronger. We re-
quire Presidents to tell us their rea-
sons and do it in no less than 30 days in 
advance of the removal. Neither of 
these provisions did anything to pre-
vent the President from performing his 
constitutional responsibility to hire 
and fire people within the executive 
branch of government. 
Unfortunately, Presidents from both 
political parties—let me emphasize 
‘‘from both political parties’’—seem to 
have a hard time following this simple 
notice requirement. 
When 
President 
Obama 
fired 
IG 
Walpin of the Corporation for National 
and Community Service early in his 
term, he sent a vaguely worded letter 
saying only that he had ‘‘lost con-
fidence’’ in Mr. Walpin. When Presi-
dent Trump fired IGs Linick and At-
kinson last year, he sent letters to 
Congress saying exactly the same 
thing. 
As I explained to both Presidents 
when they sent those letters, merely 
telling Congress that you have ‘‘lost 
confidence’’ in an IG isn’t enough ex-
planation. The loss of confidence oc-
curs only after something happens. 
When announcing their decision to re-
move an IG from office, Presidents 
need to tell us what that ‘‘something’’ 
is. They need to explain why they have 
lost confidence. Failing to do so misses 
the point of the notice requirement en-
tirely. The notice requirement isn’t 
about a President’s confidence in the 
IG; it is about the public’s confidence 
in the inspector general system across 
the board. 
IGs are put in office to serve as gov-
ernment watchdogs. If IGs are carrying 
out their duties as intended, they are 
likely going to make more enemies 
than friends. They may uncover things 
that make the sitting President and 
his political appointees very uncom-
fortable. So what? No President is 
going to like every investigation that 
an IG undertakes or every report that 
an IG prepares. But IGs should not be 
fired just for doing their jobs or to pre-
vent them from releasing findings that 
may be embarrassing to an administra-
tion, Republican or Democratic. 
Requiring the President to explain in 
advance why he or she is removing an 
IG gives Congress time to evaluate 
those reasons. It helps assure Congress 
and the public that the termination 
isn’t based on politics but on real prob-
lems with the IG’s ability to carry out 
their job. 
Of course, there has been no shortage 
of bad IGs who are deserving of re-
moval. In fact, I probably had some-
thing to do with removing five or six of 
them in the years I have been in the 
U.S. Senate. Maybe some of those who 
ought to be removed are still in office. 
Recently, I called on the President, 
President Biden, to remove the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency IG due to an 
independent report by the Council of 
the Inspectors General on Integrity

and 
Efficiency 
that 
verified 
long-
standing claims to my office that she 
abused her authority. 
Whistleblowers originally came to 
my office in 2015 with concerning re-
ports that the IG was personally and 
publicly demeaning her employees. She 
referred 
to 
them 
with 
demeaning 
names such as ‘‘weasel.’’ The IG also 
allowed her deputy to threaten employ-
ees who blew the whistle to my office. 
That was over 5 years ago, and—can 
you believe it?—the abuse is still hap-
pening today. 
Based on my investigations and the 
CIGIE’s findings, I firmly believe the 
IG needs to go, but I don’t get to make 
that decision. Only the President can 
make that decision. He gets to decide 
when to exercise his constitutional au-
thority. He has a right to do so and will 
ultimately be accountable to the peo-
ple for a decision that he makes. All he 
has to do, all that is required for him 
to do under this law, is to give Con-
gress proper notice. That is how things 
should work. That is how things were 
designed to work, but unfortunately, 
that is not what has been happening. 
It is clear to me that we have to be 
even clearer that when we say we want 
reasons, we actually mean it. When 
making the decision to remove an IG, 
Presidents must send substantive, spe-
cific reasons to Congress in advance ex-
plaining the actions they are taking 
and why they are taking those actions. 
That is why I introduced S. 587, the 
Securing Inspector General Independ-
ence Act. In addition to making the no-
tice requirement even more clear, my 
bill would limit who can be an IG in an 
acting capacity and require CIGIE to 
provide guidance for annual whistle-
blower training for all IG employees. 
My cosponsors and I have an interest 
in keeping our IG system strong and 
neutral, and that is what this bill does. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to sup-
port it and ask that the Homeland Se-
curity Committee give it full consider-
ation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, 
before my friend from Iowa leaves the 
floor, and he is my friend, I didn’t come 
to debate the Line 5 Pipeline that goes 
under the Great Lakes of Michigan, but 
I will say that this is an aging pipeline 
under a precious resource called the 
Great Lakes, 20 percent of the world’s 
freshwater. The Governor is really bal-
ancing right now what are issues that 
relate to safety and trying to make 
sure that we don’t have a spill in the 
Great Lakes that would just devastate 
not only our economy and way of life 
but the country’s as well. 
S. 1260 
Mr. President, I always say that the 
people 
in 
Michigan 
can 
outwork, 
outbuild, 
and 
outimagine 
anybody. 
Whether we are building the new Ford 
all-electric F–150 truck that President 
Biden rode yesterday when he was in 
Michigan or whether it is armored ve-
hicles that keep members of the mili-
tary safe in war zones; whether it is 
solar panels and wind turbines and ap-
pliances and furniture or dollies strong 
enough to move helicopters, Michigan’s 
manufacturing workers are the best in 
the world, period. Their hard work 
makes our Nation stronger. 
Unfortunately, there are times when 
our Nation hasn’t returned the favor. 
Each year, Federal Agencies spend bil-
lions of dollars in taxpayer money on 
products from the private sector, ev-
erything from vehicles, to office fur-
niture, to electronics. 
The Buy American Act, which was 
signed back in 1933, says the Federal 
Government should give preference to 
high-quality products here in America. 
Common sense, right? American tax-
payer dollars should go to American 
manufacturers, American businesses, 
and American workers. Unfortunately, 
loopholes and waivers and outright 
noncompliance by Federal Agencies 
mean that, too many times, American 
taxpayer dollars instead go to foreign 
companies that compete against Amer-
ican 
manufacturers 
and 
American 
workers. 
Back in 2018, I released a report that 
showed that between 2008 and 2016, ex-
ceptions and waivers to the Buy Amer-
ican Act allowed Federal Agencies to 
spend about $92 billion on foreign-made 
products. That is $92 billion in missed 
opportunities for American businesses 
and American workers. 
That is why Senator BRAUN and I in-
troduced the Make It in America Act, 
along with Senator PETERS, Senator 
PORTMAN, and Senator BALDWIN. I am 
grateful that Chairman PETERS
and 
Ranking Member PORTMAN
got this 
commonsense bill into the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs 
Committee as part of the bill in front 
of us today, the Endless Frontier Act. 
I also want to thank President Biden. 
His administration reached out to me 
and asked to be briefed on the report 
that we had done, and initial executive 
orders that they put in place were very 
much in line with our recommenda-
tions, and I know they are very sup-
portive of this bill. 
My legislation ensures that we are 
holding Federal Agencies accountable 
when enforcing Buy American Act ac-
tivities. It adds new guardrails to the 
waivers. Right now, we have waivers, 
but there has been no transparency, no 
accountability, and over the years, no 
training really for how to administer 
it. Sometimes it is just easier to do a 
waiver than it is to do an extensive 
search about whether there are busi-
nesses in America that could do this 
work or provide a product. 
It also calls on products purchased by 
Federal Agencies to incorporate more 
domestic content. The supply chain is 
so important. So much of our job cre-
ation is in the parts that go into the 
product. And it helps ensure that 
American companies aren’t undercut 
by cheap foreign products. 
Of course, rules don’t matter if no-
body enforces them, so, again, it is im-
portant that this legislation makes the 
Made in America Office a permanent 
part of the Office of Management and 
Budget. It will ensure that American 
workers and businesses receive pref-
erence regardless of who is in the Oval 
Office. 
It is important to emphasize that the 
legislation doesn’t just benefit big 
businesses, and this is important. It 
calls for Agencies to use a wonderfully 
successful entity called the Manufac-
turing Extension Partnership so that 
small 
businesses 
and 
medium-sized 
manufacturers have more opportuni-
ties to sell their products to the Fed-
eral Government or provide materials 
for 
federally 
funded 
infrastructure 
projects. And, by the way, there is of-
tentimes a situation where a company 
could retool pretty quickly to provide 
a product if they knew that we were in-
terested, if we were going to purchase, 
and we should give them the oppor-
tunity if there is an American com-
pany that can step up and be able to 
create that for us. 
Everyone says we need to make more 
things in America, and here is an op-
portunity to put those words into ac-
tion. I urge colleagues to pass the End-
less Frontier Act, to get the Make It in 
America Act signed into law, and use 
our American tax dollars to purchase 
great American products that support 
great-paying American jobs. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
CHINA 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
like calling the Presiding Officer ‘‘Mr. 
President.’’ 
Let me appreciate the Presiding Offi-
cer’s support about what I am going to 
speak today to address one of the most 
significant foreign policy challenges of 
our time, which is the U.S.-China rela-
tionship; a challenge that the Senate, I 
believe, is ready to meet with bold, bi-
partisan action. 
Just weeks ago, the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee made history 
when we passed the Strategic Competi-
tion Act of 2021 by an overwhelming bi-
partisan vote of 21 to 1. This historic, 
bipartisan 
legislation 
is 
clear-eyed 
about the challenges we face, and it is 
designed to meet this consequential 
moment in U.S.-China relations. 
Over the past few years, China has 
accelerated its rise to power and sharp-
ened its efforts to undermine the lib-
eral international order that brought 
the American people and our allies so 
much prosperity and stability in the 
20th century. 
We invited China to be engaged in 
the international order. We invited 
them into the World Trade Organiza-
tion. We invited them into an inter-
national forum. We opened markets 
with them, all with the expectation 
that China, by being ultimately invited 
into the international order, would be 
part of the international order. 
Unfortunately, instead of playing by 
the rules, China, under Xi Jinping, has

May 19, 2021 
sought to undermine them. Today, 
China is challenging the United States 
across every dimension of power—polit-
ical, diplomatic, economic, innovation, 
military, even cultural—and advancing 
an alternative and deeply disturbing 
model for global governance based on 
old-fashioned 
military 
antagonism, 
predatory economic practices, and dig-
ital authoritarianism. 
The breathtaking scope, scale, and 
urgency of these challenges demands a 
policy and strategy that is genuinely 
competitive. Because of China’s ac-
tions, the national security and eco-
nomic future of the United States de-
pends on framing our relationship with 
China today through the lens of stra-
tegic competition. 
This is not about a zero-sum rela-
tionship or resurrecting a cold war 
mentality. This is about recognizing 
that in the 21st century, our strategic 
competition will revolve around the 
geo-economics of the future and Amer-
ica’s ability to successfully compete in 
new and emerging technologies and 
other hotly contested domains. This is 
about securing a regional and inter-
national order for the 21st century 
built on progressive values, one that 
encourages healthy and fair economic 
competition, promotes global security 
and stability, and strengthens human 
rights around the world. 
So how do we achieve this vision? 
Ranking Member RISCH and I incor-
porated input from almost every mem-
ber of the committee to build the Stra-
tegic Competition Act. I believe the 
Presiding Officer had amendments as 
well, which mobilizes all of our stra-
tegic, economic, and diplomatic tools 
to clearly confront the challenges 
China possesses to our national and 
economic security. 
So I am eager to see the Strategic 
Competition Act move on the floor, 
alongside the other pieces of this pack-
age, recognizing, as I have for years, 
that America’s ability to compete with 
China begins at home, replenishing the 
sources of our national strength. That 
is why the investments in the Endless 
Frontier Act provisions and the other 
domestic measures drafted by various 
committees are equally important. 
But even if we did all of those things 
alone, it would not meet our challenge 
with China because, first and foremost, 
China is a foreign policy challenge. 
That is why the Strategic Competition 
Act reaffirms our alliances and part-
nerships. It prioritizes building func-
tional, problem-solving regional archi-
tecture in our Indo-Pacific strategy. 
Every witness we had before the com-
mittee, as we prepared for this legisla-
tion, said, You have to get your Indo- 
Pacific strategy right in order to be 
able to meet the challenge of China 
under Xi Jinping. 
It promotes U.S. leadership within 
international 
organizations. 
It 
counters malign efforts by the People’s 
Republic of China and the Chinese 
Communist Party to influence those 
institutions, and it grounds our foreign 
policy in American values by author-
izing a broad range of human rights 
and civil society measures to address 
abuses in Xinjiang with ethnic Uighurs 
and to demonstrate our commitment 
to the people of Hong Kong, Tibet, and 
China’s civil society. 
It counters China’s predatory eco-
nomic practices by addressing their 
rampant intellectual property theft 
and unfair state subsidies. It helps 
other 
countries 
work 
together 
to 
counter 
China’s 
corrupt 
practices. 
China goes throughout the world hold-
ing itself out as being generous to na-
tions in Africa and Latin America and 
elsewhere, but what it ends up being is 
a debt trap of diplomacy where these 
countries become hostage to China— 
not only economically, but then, in a 
transactional basis, China says, Well, 
you can’t recognize Taiwan anymore; 
or China says, You have to vote with us 
at the U.N. Human Rights Commission 
and a whole host of other international 
forums. 
And 
it 
bolsters 
U.S. 
economic 
statecraft, those economics tools we 
can deploy to advance our foreign pol-
icy goals like investing in supply chain 
security, infrastructure development, 
digital connectivity, and cyber secu-
rity. 
Now, I do want to take a couple of 
minutes today to directly address an 
emerging line of criticism I have heard 
that this bill is somehow seeking to ig-
nite a new cold war with China. Noth-
ing could be further from the truth. 
The reality is that for more than 40 
years, the United States has sought to 
draw China into the international com-
munity as a responsible stakeholder. 
But any clear and accurate assessment 
of China’s behavior and, particularly, 
its behavior in recent years under the 
hypernationalist 
leadership 
of 
Xi 
Jinping suggests that simply con-
tinuing down that path would only re-
sult in disaster for the United States, 
for China, and for the entire world. 
Let’s just review some of China’s ac-
tions. China is committing genocide in 
Xinjiang against the Uighur people 
through forced labor. China has dis-
missed, out of hand, the ruling of the 
International Tribunal for the Law of 
the Sea with regards to its excessive 
maritime claims in the South China 
Sea, which it is militarily building up 
on and trying to intercede in the right-
ful passage of nations in the South 
China Sea. 
China has walked away from the 
commitments it made to respect intel-
lectual property rights. China has cho-
sen to betray its legally binding obliga-
tions and its own commitments to the 
people of Hong Kong, crushing ‘‘one 
country, two systems’’ and the vibrant 
democracy, economic activity, and au-
tonomy of the people of Hong Kong. 
China refuses to respect the reli-
gious, cultural, and linguistic auton-
omy of the Tibetan people and is seek-
ing to subvert the religious succession 
of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. China 
is using its Belt and Road Initiative to 
exploit lesser developed economies to 
its own advantage. China threatens the 
efforts of the international community 
to deal with climate change by build-
ing more coal-fired power plants at a 
rate that outpaces the rest of the 
world. 
So we must empower Americans, our 
partners, and our allies to protect 
against these egregious efforts to un-
dermine human rights, security, and 
our environment. We simply cannot 
turn a blind eye to China’s actions or 
wish it into becoming a better inter-
national actor. 
Now, I realize that in discussing the 
Strategic Competition Act, I laid out a 
laundry list of big, structural policy 
issues with China that we will need to 
confront as a nation, but it is essential 
that the United States meets this mo-
ment if we hope to build a more perfect 
world, one that reflects our cherished 
commitment to free societies, free 
markets, freedom of expression, free-
dom of movement, and the dignity of 
all humankind. At the end of the day, 
that is what this Strategic Competi-
tion Act is all about. 
So I look forward to a robust debate 
and discussion with my colleagues over 
the next week or two about how to re-
structure and rework U.S. policy to-
wards China so that we can be, after 
far too long, genuinely competitive. 
Together, we have to ensure the United 
States reclaims our place as a leader of 
nations and a force for good in a cha-
otic and increasingly complex world. 
MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. President, now, on another note, 
I know we have great challenges in the 
world. We are having a great challenge 
in the Middle East. I would just simply 
say that I am not a fan of having reso-
lutions brought to the floor of the Sen-
ate without the appropriate consider-
ation of the committee of jurisdic-
tion—in this case, the Senate Foreign 
Relations 
Committee—so 
that 
in-
formed, deliberate debate and con-
sensus agreements come together in 
the best pursuit of foreign policy. 
It is easy to get caught up in the pas-
sions of the moment. It is much more 
difficult to think about what is the 
right policy and procedure and action 
the United States should take in any 
given part of the world. 
So I know there is a bunch of resolu-
tions that are being flown around— 
none of which have gone to the com-
mittee—some that have merit in each 
and every dimension but also have 
challenges. They fall short of what I 
think would need to be done, and I 
would urge colleagues to, particularly 
at this moment, have restraint, and I 
would urge the ability for the com-
mittee to be able to consider what is 
the 
appropriate 
course 
of 
action, 
whether it be at this time or any other 
time, as our Nation faces global chal-
lenges. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2759 
May 19, 2021 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, during 
my recent travels across Iowa on my 
99-county tour, I couldn’t help but no-
tice the number of ‘‘Help Wanted’’ or 
‘‘Now Hiring’’ signs on storefronts 
along nearly every highway and Main 
Street. 
In an era where we seem to live 
through one unprecedented occurrence 
after another, the dire job situation 
has become the latest extraordinary 
event as millions of Americans remain 
unemployed, despite an abundance of 
jobs that need to be filled. 
In fact, the number of available jobs 
has reached an alltime record high, 8.1 
million positions that need to be filled. 
And 44 percent of all small business 
owners have openings they cannot fill, 
another record. What makes this all 
the more stunning is that the Nation’s 
unemployment 
rate 
increased 
last 
month to 6.1 percent. There are now 
more than 9 million jobless Americans, 
and nearly a third of those have been 
unemployed for a year or more. 
In Iowa, the number of unemployed 
slowly inched upwards in February and 
March, and we continue to have more 
job openings than we do job seekers. 
There are more than 62,000 job listings 
posted on the Iowa Workforce Develop-
ment website, which exceeds the total 
number of Iowans filing for unemploy-
ment benefits. 
The jobs span a variety of occupa-
tions and locations in the State, and 
employers are desperate to fill them. 
The police department of Iowa City is 
urgently trying to hire 10 officers and 
is offering a $5,000 signing bonus to new 
recruits. And I should note that an-
other factor here could be the ongoing 
efforts to defund the police being 
pushed by folks on the left. 
The owner of the Blind Pig res-
taurant in Cedar Rapids is paying high-
er wages plus a $500 sign-on bonus, but 
even that isn’t enough to attract work-
ers. He says in the past he would get up 
to 50 applicants when he placed a ‘‘Help 
Wanted’’ notice, but now he might get 
2. Yep, that is it. Two, he said, if he is 
lucky. 
So what gives? Part of the problem is 
that the government pays folks more 
to stay home than to go to work. 
I have heard from restaurant owners 
in Bellevue who need about 36 employ-
ees between their two locations and 
can only find 20. They have been forced 
to suspend plans to expand, costing ad-
ditional jobs and stifling economic de-
velopment. 
Similarly, the owner of a small busi-
ness in Cedar Rapids that offers good- 
paying jobs that don’t require a college 
degree was turned down by three sepa-
rate people because they chose to stay 
on unemployment instead. 
I have also heard from folks who run 
in-home care services in West Des 
Moines and Cedar Rapids about their 
difficulties hiring providers for their 
professional care teams. Again, this is 
all due, in large part, to the Federal 
Government’s excessive unemployment 
perks. 
This may have made some sense a 
year ago, when there was plenty of un-
certainty. But due to the success of Op-
eration Warp Speed, we now have vac-
cines; and COVID cases, hospitaliza-
tions, and deaths are trending down. 
Despite thousands being out of work 
in Siouxland, local businesses can’t 
find the workers they need. The store 
manager of Sam’s Mini Mart says: 
‘‘People come in here and say, why 
work when I don’t have to, when unem-
ployment’s going to pay me?’’ He goes 
on to say: ‘‘We’ve even upped our 
wages, our starting wages, and nothing 
seems to work.’’ 
Paying people not to work is not 
helpful. It is delaying us from return-
ing to normal, prepandemic life. For 
our 
businesses 
in 
Iowa, 
‘‘normal’’ 
means operating at full capacity. 
If we are going to begin erasing the 
damages caused by the last year of the 
pandemic and get our economy moving 
again, we cannot continue to let Demo-
crats disincentivize work. 
Thankfully, in Iowa, our great Gov-
ernor, 
Kim 
Reynolds, 
has 
already 
taken steps to curb the excessive Fed-
eral unemployment that has kept 
Iowans on the sidelines and created 
these challenges for our employers. 
Now, we need to do more nationwide. 
As a senior member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, I am hoping to lead a bi-
cameral effort to end the enhanced 
perks at the Federal level. The Get 
Americans Back to Work Act, which I 
helped put forward, decreases the extra 
Federal unemployment benefits to $150 
per week at the end of this month and 
then fully repeals them at the end of 
June. 
It is time for Congress, the Biden ad-
ministration, and State leaders across 
the country to do their jobs and help 
Americans get back to work. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ROSEN). The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I was 
watching Senator ERNST
give this 
speech. And as to that ‘‘Help Wanted’’ 
sign, I thought I was back in Spring-
field, MO, my hometown, where I was 
this weekend. There were occasions 
when I was driving down a block, and I 
started looking to see if there was a 
place that didn’t have a ‘‘Help Wanted’’ 
sign up. They were everywhere—‘‘Help 
Wanted’’ signs, hiring bonuses, rates 
well above the minimum wage. Our 
minimum wage is $10.30 in our State. 
There were rates well above that being 
advertised on the ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs. 
You know, we all were disappointed 
by the job numbers that were issued at 
the end of April. But, obviously, the 
job numbers didn’t reflect the fact that 
there weren’t jobs to be had. It was just 
that there weren’t people taking the 
jobs to be had. 
We need to think about everything 
we can to create an environment where 
people want to go back to work, where 
people are encouraged to go back to 
work, and where people who can’t go 
back to work have that basic unem-
ployment benefit. Nobody is begrudg-
ing that, but I think it is clear that we 
have made some mistakes here. 
Now, many of us were concerned 
about this when it initially came up, 
and we were not able to turn back the 
additional bonus at the time, though 
the predictions were just too true 
about what might happen. 
What small businesses in Missouri 
are saying is pretty consistent all over 
the State. In St. Louis, the manager of 
Mary Ann’s Tea Room said: ‘‘It is 
heartbreaking that the business is 
there, but I can’t hire anyone.’’ And 
that restaurant was forced to just close 
down because they didn’t have enough 
workers. 
In Kansas City, the president of the 
Big Biscuit restaurant said: ‘‘We’ve 
never had a hiring drought like this be-
fore.’’ And according to him, he said, 
there is ‘‘no doubt we are up against 
unemployment that has been artifi-
cially increased and stimulus payments 
that give people the opportunity not to 
show up for work.’’ 
In Branson, just as the busy summer 
season is getting underway, the general 
manager at Mel’s Hard Luck Diner 
says he is so short-staffed that they 
have to close Sunday evenings now—a 
time when they would normally be 
open, just to compensate for the fact 
that they don’t have enough people to 
do the 7 evenings and 7 days of business 
that they were used to doing. He says 
he can’t even get people to show up for 
a job interview, let alone show up to 
work. 
Just down the street in Branson, at 
one of the great theme parks in Amer-
ica, the Silver Dollar City Theme Park, 
they told me a couple of weeks ago 
that they could hire 150 people the next 
day—that would still be their view, by 
the way—if they could find 150 people. 
They have 150 jobs, and they have more 
customers than they have people, so 
not everybody could get in the park 
that would normally be able to come to 
the park. 
In Columbia, right in the middle of 
our State, the owner of Just Jeff’s said: 
‘‘There’s not a person that I come into 
contact with . . . as a businessowner or 
manager or something like that, that 
isn’t in a terrible pinch right now for 
help.’’ 
That is just a snapshot of all we are 
seeing. I talked to one person who runs 
a family hotel chain. It is a big family 
hotel chain based in St. Louis. He said: 
We have the customers now who are 
coming back, but we don’t have the 
help. We could fill more rooms than we 
are filling if we had people who could 
clean the rooms and get them ready 
the next day. 
Businesses are ready to be back and 
be fully open, but they don’t have the 
workers they need. 
We had an amendment in the CARES 
Act, one of the five bipartisan bills we 
passed last year, that would have pre-
vented people from making more when 
they are unemployed than when they

are working. I said at the time, when I 
voted for that amendment, that I was 
concerned that these enhanced unem-
ployment benefits would really create 
a time when people didn’t want to go 
back to work, and, unfortunately, that 
is exactly what happened in Missouri 
and around the country. 
It has been a tough year, we all know 
that, for small business owners. We 
stepped up and tried to think of early 
ways to keep people on their payrolls 
rather than on the unemployment 
rolls. By the way, even at that time, 
many of those businesses were saying, 
well, that is a great idea. We would 
like to keep them on our payroll, but 
they can make more money on the un-
employment rolls. Is that fair to them, 
to not let them go to this unemploy-
ment that the government and its poli-
cies made so appealing? 
They were trying to fight the worst 
public health crisis ever and trying to 
keep businesses afloat. Now they are 
trying to figure out: As we come out of 
the public health crisis, what do we do 
to keep that business going? 
You know, that misguided govern-
ment policy—that comment Ronald 
Reagan used to make—is one of the 
scariest things you could hear: ‘‘I am 
from the government, and I am here to 
help.’’ This seems to be a case where 
that truly has been a scary thing: The 
government, trying to help, trying to 
reach out and do what at least a major-
ity of our colleagues thought was the 
right thing, has created a situation 
that is different than it needs to be. 
Twenty-one States have now either 
decided to stop participating already 
or have announced that they are going 
to stop participating. Governor Parson 
in Missouri made that decision. As 
Senator ERNST
mentioned, the Gov-
ernor of Iowa has made and 19 other 
Governors have made that decision. 
The average unemployment benefit 
in the States in America right now is 
$618 a week. That is the average. That 
includes the $300 that the Federal Gov-
ernment has put into every one of 
those checks that are still going out at 
that level. That is $15.46 an hour. Cer-
tainly, one way to mandate a $15 hour-
ly pay rate is just to decide that is 
what you are going to make if you are 
unemployed. Well, it hasn’t worked. It 
won’t work. Our State of Missouri and 
other States are moving away from 
this. 
In Washington, we make policies, and 
one of our responsibilities is to be sure 
that we are keeping an eye on unin-
tended consequences. The law of unin-
tended consequences is one of the great 
certainties of making law, and we need 
to watch out for that. We have a huge 
unintended consequence here. We saw 
what happened when now the Biden ad-
ministration is trying to explain why 
it is not their policies that appear to be 
slowing the recovery down, but we all 
know that this is part of that problem. 
We have done something to cause 
this problem. We need to figure out 
how to solve this problem. This should 
not be something that States, one at a 
time, reject. We need to get our econ-
omy back on track as quickly as pos-
sible. 
There is virtue in work, and I hope 
we make work more appealing again 
than not working. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in February of this year, there was bi-
partisan conversation about what is 
the next step dealing with COVID. We 
knew we were coming out of it. Vac-
cines were going in arms. States were 
opening up. My State in Oklahoma was 
rapidly opening in February, and there 
was this dialogue about what would 
happen in the economy. 
Unfortunately, in the middle of that 
dialogue, my Democratic colleagues 
determined: We were going to go this 
on our own. 
We still stay engaged. One of the big 
issues, though, was unemployment. 
Would there be additional unemploy-
ment benefits that would be done? 
Now, myself and multiple others 
raised the issue on both sides of the 
aisle: How would this be handled? 
If it was a year before—literally, in 
March of 2020, there was an extension 
of unemployment because unemploy-
ment was at 15 percent at that point, 
and there were no jobs to be had. But 
in March of this year, when the agree-
ment was finally made and a straight 
partisan bill was passed, we weren’t at 
15 percent unemployment. It was at 6 
percent and driving down to the floor. 
Now we are below 4 percent. 
The challenge that we have is, there 
is additional unemployment benefits 
that have extended all the way until 
September. 
Now, that bill passed—a straight par-
tisan bill—in March. By the Sunday 
after Palm Sunday, when I was back in 
my 
State, 
I 
was 
already 
having 
businessowners catching me and say-
ing: What in the world? I can’t hire 
now because I am competing for wages 
with someone in the Federal Govern-
ment. 
What has that meant for right now? 
Now and May, what does that mean for 
us in Oklahoma? 
In Oklahoma, there are 37 percent 
more jobs available now than there 
were a year and a half ago before the 
pandemic began, when we were at the 
best economy in 50 years. Literally, 
there are more job openings in Okla-
homa now than there have ever been in 
the history of our records. 
Let me run that past everybody 
again. There are more openings in 
Oklahoma right now for jobs than ever 
in the history of our recordkeeping for 
our State, but we can’t fill jobs because 
people are making so much money on 
unemployment and they get the first 
$10,000 of that written off on their 
taxes. 
Those 
two 
pieces 
together 
incentivize people, literally, to be able 
to stay home. 
Our State has had to take a pretty 
radical step, quite frankly. We have 
stepped in with 20 other States and 
have ended the unemployment assist-
ance, but we have had to take it the 
next step because we have so many job 
openings in our State. We are literally 
giving a $1,200 bonus to anyone who 
will go back to work. For the first 
20,000 people who will actually get off 
of unemployment benefits and go back 
to work, we are paying a $1,200 bonus 
to those individuals to return to work. 
What in the world? Why would we have 
to do this as a State? Our State is tak-
ing leadership, and I am grateful to 
Governor Stitt and his continued lead-
ership to be able to help navigate our 
economy and our families. But why 
would we want to have a situation 
where we have literally disincentivized 
work and encouraged people to not re-
turn to work? What Governor Stitt has 
set up is an encouragement to actually 
get back to work. That is better for 
families. That is better for children. 
That is better for our economy. 
Right now in Oklahoma, if you are 
going to build anything—and I mean 
build 
anything—good 
luck 
finding 
building supplies. And it is not because 
we don’t have lumber. It is not because 
we don’t have bricks. It is not because 
we don’t have windows and shingles 
and all those things. Good luck getting 
it because they can’t get enough labor 
to actually do the manufacturing. So 
everyone is running behind simply be-
cause there is a shortage of labor be-
cause we are incentivizing people to 
stay home rather than to be able to 
come back. 
Shots are in arms. Our rates of 
COVID have decreased dramatically. It 
is time for us to return to work. But 
now we are going to have a situation 
where we have right now—where half 
the country is incentivized to stay 
home. Now you have 21 States—slight-
ly less than half the country—that are 
trying to incentivize people to get back 
to work. 
We need, as a nation, to incentivize 
work and to encourage families to be 
able to be engaged in productive activi-
ties. It is right for families. It is right 
for our economy. It is certainly right 
for us as a nation. And I thank Gov-
ernor Stitt for his leadership in this 
area and for what we continue to do, 
but we have to get back to basic poli-
cies that don’t disincentivize work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, 
let me say that I agree with my col-
league from Oklahoma who just talked 
about the impact of the Federal supple-
ment 
on 
unemployment 
that 
was 
passed here in this Chamber and signed 
into law by the President. It is time to 
end 
it 
because 
the 
situation 
has 
changed dramatically, hasn’t it? 
Back when the unemployment addi-
tional benefit from the Federal Gov-
ernment was put in place, we had peo-
ple who couldn’t go to work. Thanks to 
COVID, businesses actually were shut 
down, many by government edict.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2761 
May 19, 2021 
There were people who lost their jobs 
through no fault of their own. There-
fore, this Chamber stood up and said: 
OK, for those people, we ought to pro-
vide a Federal supplement on top of the 
State 
unemployment 
insurance 
in 
order to make them whole, essentially. 
Initially it was $600. Now it is $300. 
That is on top of the State unemploy-
ment. 
Now you have an exact opposite situ-
ation. You have all these jobs that are 
open. I just learned that in Oklahoma, 
it is a record number. Guess what. It is 
a record number nationally as well: 8.1 
million jobs are being offered right 
now. That is more jobs than we have 
ever had open in the United States of 
America, and it is happening right 
now. 
At the same time, you have people on 
unemployment insurance who are get-
ting the additional $300 on top of the 
State benefit. In Ohio, the average is 
$360 plus $300, so 660 bucks a week. 
Plus, the first $10,000 is not taxed. So if 
you are a truckdriver making 40,000 
bucks a year, you are being taxed, but 
if you are on unemployment insurance, 
your first $10,000 of UI is not being 
taxed. How is that fair? 
Well, it creates an additional dis-
incentive to go to work. I am not say-
ing it is the only reason people aren’t 
going back to work, but if you talk to 
the small business folks in your State, 
you will find it is one of the big rea-
sons. I think it is the biggest one. 
Another one is that people are having 
a tough time finding childcare. I get 
that. Childcare is expensive. Part of 
the solution to that, of course, is to get 
the kids back to school. Fifty-four per-
cent of K–8 schools are back in busi-
ness, but the rest aren’t. Schools being 
closed makes it really tough for par-
ents to go back to work because one 
parent has to be there to take care of 
the kids. That is true. 
Then, finally, there is an issue of the 
skills gap. I get that. The jobs that are 
available, some of them are skilled 
jobs. There are 720,000 manufacturing 
jobs in America open right now—right 
now. Yet a lot of them do require a 
skill level that, unfortunately, our sys-
tem of education and training has not 
prepared people for. This is why our 
young people need to be given more op-
portunities to get those industry-rec-
ognized certificates to become a welder 
or become a technician or become a 
coder in the IT world or become a 
truckdriver, because we need those 
skills badly. 
But the biggest reason, again, that I 
am hearing all over my State of Ohio is 
the fact that people are saying: You 
know what, I am making what I can 
make on UI, and that is more than I 
can make at work. For 42 percent of 
Americans, on average, that is true. 
Forty-two percent are making more on 
UI. That is not even including the fact 
that the first $10,000 is tax-free. In 
Ohio, it is more than double the min-
imum wage. That is what people are 
making. 
So this is a problem right now, and 
we should face it. By the way, it is in 
the interest of everybody to resolve 
this issue. It is in the interest of the 
small businesses that can’t find people. 
Some of these businesses are literally 
shutting down. Geordie’s, a restaurant 
in Columbus, OH, is closed. They lit-
erally closed because they can’t find 
workers. Other restaurants all over the 
State of Ohio are going 5 days a week 
instead of 6 or 7 days a week or cutting 
a shift because they can’t find workers. 
So it is definitely helpful for those 
small businesses and for all businesses, 
but, second, it is great for the taxpayer 
to not have to pay that extra 300 bucks 
a week. It is billions of dollars, tens of 
billions of dollars, even hundreds of bil-
lions of dollars when it is all added to-
gether, compared to what it would be 
under current law, where the $300 sup-
plement goes until Labor Day—Labor 
Day—with 8.1 million jobs open right 
now. 
Finally, I would argue it is particu-
larly good for workers to get back to 
work, to get back to their careers, to 
get back to the training they need to 
keep up with what is going on at work. 
It is not in anybody’s interest to 
have folks not back in the workforce. 
We should all want people to be back at 
work getting the fulfillment you get 
from work and the dignity and self-re-
spect that come from work, but getting 
a paycheck and getting healthcare in-
surance again and getting back into 
their 401(k) plans and, again, closing 
that resume gap so they are up to 
speed on the training. 
I will tell you what is happening, and 
this is what concerns me and I think 
should concern every Member of this 
Chamber. Businesses are adjusting. Do 
you know what they are doing? They 
are not just shutting down. They are 
not just closed 2 days a week. They are 
not just cutting out a shift. Some of 
them are changing the way they oper-
ate in order to be more efficient. What 
does that mean? That means, when you 
can’t find workers, you turn to tech-
nology, you turn to automation. And it 
is happening. 
I know there are Members of this 
Chamber who think that by giving 
more money to people, this is a very 
smart thing to do and it is helping ev-
erybody. It is not helping because 
those jobs are not going to be there in 
the future. 
There was a story in the Washington 
Post today about Huntington Banc-
shares. It is a bank in Columbus, OH. 
They are fielding literally dozens of 
calls from business owners who are try-
ing to get financing to buy more equip-
ment that will offset their loss in 
workers; in other words, more automa-
tion, more technology that they would 
not have otherwise gone to, but be-
cause they can’t find any workers, they 
are using their money they would have 
paid workers to go to more technology. 
Those jobs are gone. 
I know, again, some people, maybe on 
my side of the aisle, think that might 
be a good thing, a more efficient econ-
omy. I want people at work. I want 
companies to be hiring more people. 
A good friend of mine is a manufac-
turer. She has about 200 people. She 
makes a great product—windows—in 
Ohio, southwest Ohio, Hamilton, OH. 
She is looking for 60 people right now. 
Sixty people. She is offering a signing 
bonus of a thousand bucks and offering 
other benefits. People aren’t showing 
up. But when the $300 ends and when 
the additional $10,000 of unemployment 
insurance not being taxed ends, people 
will go back to work. 
The first State to decide ‘‘You know 
what, we are going to unilaterally just 
say we are not going to take the $300‘‘ 
was the State of Montana. My col-
league from Montana told me recently 
that he has a friend who is a hotel 
owner, and he was having a job fair 
every week trying to get people to 
come in to apply for jobs. He was get-
ting about one applicant per week. The 
week after the Governor said no more 
$600 or no more $300 benefit on unem-
ployment insurance in addition to the 
State benefit, 60 people showed up. 
That may be an extreme example, but 
I have to tell you, it is going to make 
a big difference. 
Let’s help get this economy going 
again. We are turning the corner on 
COVID. We have a situation now where 
we can actually get started again, get 
the businesses reopened. 
I talked about the business owner in 
Columbus, OH, who was closed down. 
Do you know what his comment was? 
He said: I used the PPP program. 
That is the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, which we all passed here. 
I got through COVID. We struggled, 
but we made it through COVID. We 
could make it through COVID, but now 
we can’t make it because of our own 
government paying people more not to 
work on unemployment insurance than 
we can pay them to work. 
He feels like his own government has 
turned on him. 
That is not helping anybody. It is not 
helping the small businesses, it is cer-
tainly not helping the taxpayer, and it 
is not helping those individuals who 
are not getting back to work, back to 
their routines, back to the training, 
back to the 401(k) plan, back to their 
healthcare plan, and having the oppor-
tunity 
to 
achieve 
their 
American 
dream. 
I hope that we change our minds here 
and don’t continue this until Sep-
tember 6 and decide, instead, let’s get 
people back to work. 
I would also be for a $100-a-week sign-
ing bonus if people were to go back to 
work. I think that would be a good use 
of funding. Let’s, say, do that for 6 
weeks and at the same time stop the 
$300 Federal supplement. By doing 
that, those 8-million-plus jobs that are 
available right now would start to get 
filled, and we could really get our econ-
omy back on track. 
I yield back my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2762 
May 19, 2021 
Mr. WICKER. Madam President, my 
friend from Ohio is correct. In many re-
spects, it ought to feel like morning 
again in America. After all, COVID–19 
is finally on the retreat. The vaccines 
have been a roaring success because of 
Operation Warp Speed. One hundred 
and twenty-four million Americans are 
now fully immunized, and another 30 
million are halfway there. With the ex-
ception of a few holdout States, the 
mask mandates are gone, thank good-
ness. By all measures, our economy 
should be firing on all cylinders, but 
America now has a workforce problem. 
People are not heading back to work. 
In February, the Congressional Budg-
et Office predicted our economy would 
return to its prepandemic size by the 
middle of the year without receiving 
any new stimulus from Congress. Re-
grettably, Democrats in this Chamber 
brushed off that optimism from the 
CBO. They decided to pass more stim-
ulus, to the tune of $1.9 trillion. 
This time, the money was excessive. 
It was poorly targeted and passed with-
out 
bipartisan 
consensus. 
Three 
months later, the results are unflat-
tering for my Democratic friends. Last 
month, our economy produced a paltry 
266,000 jobs when experts had predicted 
over 1 million jobs—this at a time 
when our economy has a record 8 mil-
lion jobs available, jobs that need to be 
filled. 
Small businesses are desperate to 
hire. Restaurants, for instance, are 
having trouble finding people to be-
come waiters and chefs. The National 
Restaurant Association reports that, in 
January, 8 percent of restaurant opera-
tors said finding and keeping workers 
was their No. 1 concern. That number 
doubled in February. It doubled again 
in March and then again in April. Ac-
cording to the latest survey, 57 percent 
of restaurant operators now say that 
finding and keeping employees is their 
biggest problem. The same problem ex-
ists across multiple sectors—hotels, 
construction, lawn care, welding, tech. 
The list goes on. 
Americans would be streaming back 
into the workforce if not for the coun-
terproductive policies passed by the 
majority. Government is now paying 
millions of able-bodied Americans to 
stay home, to stay home when they 
could be back on the job. Expanded un-
employment benefits have become a 
hindrance to our recovery rather than 
a help, just as many of us had warned. 
March 2020 was a unique moment of 
emergency that called for urgent finan-
cial relief for the American people. 
This body passed it on a sweeping bi-
partisan basis. But it is now May of 
2021. 
The 
hour 
of 
emergency 
has 
passed. Americans need policies to help 
them reenter the workforce. 
Fortunately, millions of Americans 
have Governors who are pushing back 
against Washington’s pay-to-stay-at- 
home policies. Governor Tate Reeves, 
in my State of Mississippi, is one ex-
ample. I commend Governor Reeves for 
opting out of the expanded Federal un-
employment funds in order to help our 
State embark on a full recovery. Near-
ly half of all Governors now share the 
same mind and are saying no to those 
unnecessary funds. 
Madam President, the American peo-
ple elected a 50–50 Senate and a nar-
rowly divided House. They do not want 
drastic changes or dramatic growth of 
government. They simply want to put 
this pandemic behind them and get 
back to providing for their families. 
Americans need government to get 
out of the way, and Republicans stand 
with the American people and on the 
side of a full recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, 
first, I would like to associate myself 
with the fine remarks of the Senator 
from Mississippi, who sees every day, 
when he is home traveling in his State, 
the same things I am seeing in Wyo-
ming—‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs all around 
our home States, as businesses are 
looking for people to hire, and the gov-
ernment’s incentives are making it 
that much harder to find workers. 
Job openings right now are at a 
record high in America. There were 8 
million jobs available going into April. 
Yet in that month, only about one- 
quarter of a million people actually 
were hired. The unemployment rate ac-
tually went up. 
We lost manufacturing. We lost re-
tail. We lost healthcare jobs last 
month. Construction jobs were flat. 
Ten million people are unemployed 
right now, even though there are 8 mil-
lion job openings. 
Every Senator I talk to says that 
there are ‘‘Help Wanted’’ signs all 
around their home State. Nearly every 
American who wants a job should be 
able to find one. Yet it is really not 
happening. 
The question has been asked and an-
swered on this floor by various Mem-
bers of the Republican Party: Why 
can’t small businesses find workers? 
Why are so many of these jobs unfilled? 
Because something like this doesn’t 
just happen on its own. Oh, no. This 
happens as a direct result of the Presi-
dent’s policies. 
President Biden and Democrats are 
paying people to stay home. That is 
why so many people are staying home. 
They are being paid more to not work 
than to work. According to one anal-
ysis, nearly half of all people on unem-
ployment benefits with the unemploy-
ment benefit bonus payment—the extra 
check—are making more money by 
staying at home than they would make 
if they go to work. 
These people aren’t lazy. Oh, no. 
When the President and Democrats 
offer people free money to stay home, 
it is perfectly logical—people take 
them up on the offer. 
I believe the American people want 
to work. That is what I see at home in 
Wyoming. That is who we are. That is 
the fiber of the American people. We 
are the hardest working people in the 
world. American businesses want to 
hire. Yet Joe Biden and Big Govern-
ment are getting in the way. 
President Biden has actually ex-
tended bonus payments until Sep-
tember. We are now in May. May, June, 
July, August, September—month after 
month, after month, after month of 
more of this. This is a grave danger to 
small businesses across America. If 
they can’t find workers, they might 
have to close again. Then those job 
openings will no longer be there, and 
they will be gone forever. 
President Biden appears to be, in my 
opinion, in denial on this. He held a 
press conference recently, and this is 
what he said: It is all ‘‘loose talk.’’ 
This is not loose talk. This is basic 
arithmetic. Job openings are going up; 
hiring is slowing down; and nearly half 
of workers make more money by stay-
ing at home. 
‘‘Loose talk’’ is when the President 
of the United States tells us everything 
is just fine when it is not. April was the 
most disappointing jobs report in more 
than 20 years—two decades. Yet Presi-
dent Biden says the jobs report ‘‘shows 
we’re on the right track.’’ 
No, it doesn’t. Hiring has slowed 
down. Some say people aren’t return-
ing to work because of coronavirus. 
Madam President, let me tell you, it 
is very unlikely. We are vaccinating 2 
million people a day. One in three 
Americans is now—these are adults— 
fully vaccinated already. We are get-
ting the virus behind us. We have been 
very successful with Operation Warp 
Speed. 
We should be filling the 8 million 
jobs available right now. Yet what are 
President Biden and the Democrats 
doing to fix the problem? Nothing, 
nothing at all. I believe they are mak-
ing it worse by extending these bonus 
payments. It is time the President and 
Democrats worked for a solution. 
You know, I am proud that the peo-
ple of Wyoming and the Governor of 
Wyoming have done just that. Wyo-
ming has taken a leadership role, along 
with approximately 20 other States, in 
ending these bonus payments. It is 
going to give our economy a boost. It is 
going to lead to more hiring. 
It is time for President Biden and the 
Democrats to follow the successful lead 
of the people of Wyoming. Stop paying 
people a bonus to stay home. Reward 
the hard work that is a part of America 
and Americans’ DNA. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
earlier this month, the Department of 
Labor’s jobs report showed an uptick of 
the unemployment rate to 6.1 percent 
and employers only adding 266,000 jobs, 
despite widespread projections of ap-
proximately 1 million jobs to be gained 
in April. 
To call this a dismal jobs report 
would be an understatement. It was the 
worst jobs miss since 1998. Yet it is not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2763 
May 19, 2021 
surprising considering the many con-
versations I have had with Kansans 
throughout my travels. I have heard 
constantly how employers are strug-
gling to find people for open jobs, 
largely because folks are staying at 
home due to the increased unemploy-
ment dollars and the stimulus checks 
that Democrats continue to push. 
Earlier this year, Democrats forced 
through legislation—without any Re-
publican support—that provided $300 
more per week in Federal unemploy-
ment benefits. This additional benefit, 
when coupled with the extended unem-
ployment benefits offered by States, al-
ready means that the average recipient 
is making $15 to $20 per hour to stay 
home. 
Democrats have made it more profit-
able for many Americans to stay unem-
ployed. That is because these policies 
are not intended to help our economic 
recovery. They are intended to reform 
our American system and create more 
dependency on the government. 
This leap toward socialism comes at 
a time when our Nation is on its way to 
reaching herd immunity and businesses 
are emerging from government-im-
posed lockdowns. Now President Biden 
has delivered them a government-fund-
ed labor shortage. 
I recently heard from a wonderful 
small business in my hometown of 
Great Bend, KS, that are short-staffed 
by some 70 employees—that is 70 em-
ployees they are short-staffed. They 
are unable to match the strong incen-
tive to stay home provided by the Fed-
eral unemployment benefits in order to 
rehire their workforce. The company’s 
mission is to provide educational and 
work opportunities for people with de-
velopmental disabilities, giving nearly 
200 individuals in the area the inde-
pendence, inclusion, and training that 
they need to achieve success. This 
labor shortage directly affects their 
ability to meet the needs of the people 
they serve. 
I have heard stories from manufac-
turers across Kansas struggling to re-
call their workers, despite offering gen-
erous benefits and high-wage jobs or 
restaurants remaining closed because 
they don’t have enough employees for 
their basic operations. 
Homes aren’t being built because of a 
lack of labor, and hotels are turning 
away business because they don’t have 
employees. One company even shared a 
story of offering a high-skilled and 
high-wage position only to be turned 
down because the prospective employee 
claimed they were comfortable on un-
employment, and the hours clashed 
with the local bowling league. 
We have seen the broader supply 
chain begin to feel the impacts, as a 
lack of truckdrivers means that build-
ing materials, computer chips, and 
common household goods like tooth-
paste and toilet paper can’t reach their 
destination, or food processing plants 
are short-staffed and turning out less 
product than usual, driving up the cost 
for consumers. 
Coupled with the trillions of Federal 
dollars that have gone out the door so 
far, we are beginning to see inflation. 
In fact, the Department of Labor’s re-
cently released consumer price index 
for April showed the largest spike in 
inflation since 2008. 
There are a record 8 million jobs— 
that is 8 million opportunities waiting 
to be filled across this country. In my 
home State of Kansas, we have 57,000 
job openings, and the March labor re-
port shows over 58,000 Kansans received 
unemployment insurance. 
While there are certainly people who 
need access to increased unemploy-
ment benefits during the heart of this 
pandemic, 
unemployment 
insurance 
was never meant to be a permanent 
salary replacement. 
Rather, the benefit is meant to pro-
vide temporary assistance while folks 
get back on their feet. The government 
should not be in the business of cre-
ating lucrative government depend-
ency that makes it more beneficial to 
stay unemployed rather than return to 
work. That is called socialism. 
Nearly half of the States have halted 
the additional benefits, and I have 
called for the Democratic Governor 
from my home State to do the same. 
Unfortunately, no State in the Union 
with 
a 
Democratic 
executive 
has 
stepped up and dropped the benefits, 
despite many of these States having 
the highest unemployment rates in the 
country. Instead, Democrats in Con-
gress are moving to make the enhanced 
benefits permanent. 
For all these reasons, last week, 15 of 
my colleagues joined me in introducing 
the Get Americans Back to Work Act, 
which decreases Federal unemploy-
ment benefits to $150 per week at the 
end of May and then fully repeals them 
altogether at the end of June. Not only 
will this help get people back to work 
but the savings generated can be used 
to pay for roads and bridges. 
Let me close by saying ‘‘work’’ is not 
a four-letter, dirty word. A job brings 
dignity and purpose to all who have 
one. Over the past year, we have made 
great strides to develop safe and effec-
tive vaccines. Because more Americans 
are getting their shots, we have seen 
COVID cases decline to nearly a quar-
ter of where they were in January. Now 
is the time for folks to get back to 
work, to get our kids back in school, 
and 
get 
our 
economy 
back 
to 
prepandemic levels. 
I yield the floor. 
S. 1260 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. WAR-
REN). The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, 
if I could just say something, for a sec-
ond, while the Senator from Mississippi 
is here. It has been one of the great 
joys 
to 
collaborate 
with 
Senator 
WICKER on so many important policies 
last year, working on everything from 
aviation 
to 
maritime 
and 
foreign 
issues, and now working on this legis-
lation and infrastructure and on many 
things that we want to do for the fu-
ture. I thank him for his collaborative 
work on this process. 
No one probably relished the speed at 
which we moved through on this bill 
from our committee perspective, but, 
nonetheless, I think the committee ac-
tually had a lot of joy in the fact that 
we were at regular order and could 
process so many amendments and have 
that diverse of a conversation. The sub-
ject matter, in and of itself, is so im-
portant—it really is—to get this right. 
When I think about our attempts at 
America COMPETES in 2007 and 2010, 
we were enthusiastic, but we didn’t 
convince the rest of everybody to put 
the money behind it. It makes me 
think that I am glad we are creating 
more of a robust debate about why this 
competitive issue is so important. 
AMENDMENT NOS. 1517 AND 1547 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the following amend-
ments be called up and reported by 
number: the Tillis-Hirono amendment 
No. 1517 and the Scott-Johnson amend-
ment No. 1547; further, that at 4 p.m. 
today the Senate vote in relation to 
the amendments in the order listed, 
with no amendments in order prior to 
those votes in relation to the amend-
ments, with 60 affirmative votes re-
quired for adoption, and 2 minutes of 
debate, equally divided, between the 
two votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. WICKER. Reserving the right to 
object—and I shall certainly not ob-
ject—I simply want to say that this is 
the beginning of what I hope is an open 
amendment process, and I want to 
thank the chair of the Commerce Com-
mittee for working with us to get these 
first two amendment votes scheduled 
this afternoon. And I certainly with-
draw my reservation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the amend-
ments by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. 
TILLIS], for himself and others, proposes an

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1012 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, in a 
moment I will propound a unanimous 
consent request. Before I do, I want to 
make some brief remarks. 
Right now, gas stations all over the 
eastern seaboard are suffering from a 
week-long gas shortage that has left 
thousands of stations completely out of 
gas. What we have seen is reminiscent 
of the 1970s, when Americans had to sit 
in long lines to fill their cars with gas. 
Why are we experiencing this crisis? 
Because Russian hackers attacked the 
Colonial Pipeline, which had to shut 
down operations on May 7. 
What is the reward Russia gets for 
attacking our infrastructure? Well, on 
the topic of Russia, just yesterday, 
President Biden doubled down on what 
is becoming a consistent ‘‘soft on Rus-
sia’’ position from the Biden adminis-
tration, making the decision to dis-
regard 
bipartisan 
legislation 
that 
passed through this body seeking to 
shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline 
that Putin is desperately trying to 
complete between Russia and Ger-
many. 
That pipeline had been shut down. 
We had succeeded in a bipartisan vic-
tory, stopping that pipeline, but, sadly, 
Putin resumed building the pipeline 
shortly after Joe Biden was elected. 
Yesterday, President Biden made the 
decision to refuse to enforce the bipar-
tisan sanctions on the company build-
ing the pipeline for Putin. 
If that wasn’t enough, it is clear the 
Biden administration does know how 
to shut down pipelines—the Keystone 
Pipeline. His first day in office, Joe 
Biden signed an Executive order shut-
ting down the Keystone Pipeline, de-
stroying 11,000 jobs, including 8,000 
union jobs—all destroyed by the Biden- 
Harris administration. For whatever 
reason, the Biden-Harris administra-
tion seems to have a philosophy that 
American pipelines and American jobs 
are bad, but Russian pipelines and Rus-
sian jobs are apparently good. And 
Russian hackers should get rewarded 
with Putin getting billions of dollars 
because Joe Biden refuses to stand up 
to Putin. 
On the impact here at home of the 
Russian 
hacking, 
Colonial 
Pipeline 
transports 100 million gallons of fuel 
all over the east coast every day. It is 
responsible for transporting 45 percent 
of the fuel on the east coast, running 
from Texas to New Jersey. 
The Colonial Pipeline is a critical 
piece of infrastructure, and when it 
shut down, it gravely disrupted the 
daily lives of millions of Americans— 
fuel for cars, for aviation fuel, for heat-
ing homes, all completely shut down. I 
am standing here today because one 
thing this crisis has shown us is that 
we need to diversify how we transport 
energy in this country so that if our 
critical 
infrastructure 
is 
attacked 
again—and we know it is going to be 
attacked again—that we have other re-
liable ways to transport energy. 
One way to strengthen redundancy 
and to strengthen our ability to make 
it through another attack is to allow 
liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to be 
transported by rail. 
Last year, the Pipeline and Haz-
ardous Materials Administration final-
ized a rule allowing the safe transpor-
tation of LNG by rail. What this rule 
does is enable natural gas that is used 
for transportation, that is used for gen-
erating electricity, for heating homes, 
for manufacturing, to be transported 
by railroad, which helps Americans in 
hard-to-reach areas access the fuel that 
they need. It also takes pressure off of 
other critical infrastructure to meet 
our energy needs. 
Yet, now that Joe Biden is President 
and he has empowered officials in his 
administration who have a repeated 
and demonstrated hostility to Amer-
ican pipelines and American jobs and 
American energy independence, this 
rule is in jeopardy. When the Secretary 
of Transportation was before the Sen-
ate for confirmation, I repeatedly 
asked the Secretary to commit to 
maintaining the existing rule of allow-
ing the safe transport of LNG by rail, 
and, repeatedly, the Secretary refused 
to make that commitment. The fool-
ishness of that position is now evident

to everyone as we have gas lines and 
skyrocketing gas prices on the east 
coast and throughout the country. 
Therefore, Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 1012 and that 
the Senate proceed to its immediate 
consideration. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
Mr. MARKEY. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
appreciate the points that my col-
league from Texas is making, but the 
bill he is proposing to pass by unani-
mous consent has not been considered 
by the Commerce Committee, and it 
would drastically and unilaterally tie 
the hands of the Department of Trans-
portation from protecting communities 
from having massive amounts of dan-
gerous, explosive liquefied natural gas 
shipped right through their towns and 
cities. I understand that the Repub-
licans and natural gas companies want 
to railroad through the Senate a bill 
that would undermine the safety of the 
railroads in our communities, but we 
just can’t allow this to happen. 
In 2020, the Trump administration 
moved to allow trains of 100 or more 
cars to begin transporting liquefied 
natural gas with no additional safety 
regulations. It did this over the objec-
tions of the attorneys general of 15 
States and the District of Columbia. 
Firefighters 
opposed 
it. 
Railroad 
unions that represented the railroad 
employees objected to it. The environ-
mental community objected to it as 
did the National Transportation Safety 
Board. 
Listen to this: A train of 110 tank 
cars, filled with liquefied natural gas, 
would have more than five times the 
equivalent energy of the Hiroshima 
atomic bomb. 
We cannot put our firefighters, our 
railway workers, and our homes and 
families at risk from loose regulations 
on what could be catastrophically dan-
gerous trains. Too many lives are at 
stake, and the Department of Trans-
portation should have the ability to re-
view this rule. This bill that is being 
propounded right now would blind our 
safety watchdog when we should be 
putting these threats under a micro-
scope. 
I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Madam President, as the 
Senator from Massachusetts knows, 
there is an existing rule that went 
through the ordinary process in final-
izing the rule—the ordinary notice and 
comment process—that has been pro-
mulgated by the Pipeline and Haz-
ardous Materials Safety Administra-
tion. 
The Senator from Massachusetts also 
knows the reality that accidents by 
rail are very rare. While we surely 
don’t want to see any accidents occur 
or have disruptions in transporting 
LNG by rail, what we have seen by the 
cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline 
is that nothing is certain. There are 
risks to everything, but by taking pre-
cautions and diversifying our transpor-
tation methods for fuel, we make our 
energy industry more resilient to at-
tacks and accidents when they, pre-
dictably, do happen in the future. 
Furthermore, LNG is already trans-
ported by vessels and tanker trucks 
and has been for decades. Obviously, 
accidents can happen at sea or with 
tanker trucks, but that doesn’t stop us 
from transporting LNG in those ways. 
Accidents on railroads are rare, and if 
we can transport LNG by sea and in 
tanker trucks on the road, we should 
also be able to transport it by rail, 
where it is safer and more efficient and 
more effective. 
Lastly, to cope with the shutdown, 
the 
Department 
of 
Transportation 
granted waivers for hours-of-service re-
quirements to truckdrivers and Jones 
Act waivers for vessels to continue to 
transport fuel to try to alleviate the 
shortage. That just underscores the 
need for LNG by rail as well. 
Unfortunately, 
as 
Americans 
are 
standing in gas lines, the answer they 
are being given by Washington Demo-
crats is, the challenges you are facing 
don’t matter to the Democrats. What 
we have seen from this objection is 
that Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS 
support higher gas prices—much higher 
gas prices that you will have to pay at 
the pumps. They understand that much 
higher gas prices fall disproportion-
ately on low-income Americans and 
that they fall disproportionately on Af-
rican Americans and Hispanics. The 
Biden-Harris Democrats are willing to 
jack up your gas prices, to make you 
wait in line, and to say, essentially, 
‘‘tough luck.’’ They have no answers, 
but they are going to block getting en-
ergy for your home, for your vehicle, 
for your life, for your family. 
As we stand here today with a crisis 
at our southern border, as we stand 
here today with a gas crisis and gas 
lines, as we stand here today with an 
inflation crisis on the verge of erupt-
ing, and as we stand here today with 
war in the Middle East, sadly, we are 
seeing a reprise of the 1970s—the same 
failed policies producing the same dis-
astrous results—except, in the rerun, 
Joe Biden is Jimmy Carter 2.0 and 
KAMALA HARRIS is Walter Mondale. The 
country, sadly, is paying the price for 
the extreme and failed policies, and we 
are just 4 months into it. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
TRIBUTE TO ROGER BEVERAGE 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
there is a lot going on right now. I 
have already spent time on the floor 
today to talk about some of the eco-
nomic 
issues—inflation, 
unemploy-
ment—that are happening. There are a 
number of jobs that are open in my 
State. In fact, there is a record number 
of job openings in my State. There is 
unrest in the Middle East right now, 
and there are all kinds of things that 
are happening in the world. 
Yet I can’t help, just for a moment, 
pausing to be able to reflect on a friend 
of mine who, in a few days, will be sit-
ting and hanging out with his 12 grand-
children and enjoying a moment of re-
tirement. 
His name is Roger Beverage. Roger 
Beverage just retired as the CEO of the 
Oklahoma Bankers Association. He is 
not the big banker guy. He is the com-
munity banker guy. For 30 years, he 
led our State in banking and engaged 
in issues from the smallest of the small 
banks in rural Oklahoma to family- 
owned community banks that are scat-
tered around our State. He worked 
tirelessly to help individuals get access 
to banking who were blocked out, and 
he made sure that everyone had a shot. 
He has been a remarkable leader, and 
he is just a great grandpa. 
In the days ahead, I celebrate his get-
ting time with his 12 grandchildren be-
cause he has given so much to so many 
others. As he spends time with his five 
kids—just the five kids who carry 
around the 12 grandchildren at this 
point—and as he spends time with his 
bride of 43 years, Paula, I want to say 
thank you to him. 
Roger wasn’t born in Oklahoma; he 
was born in Nebraska. If you know Ne-
braska and Oklahoma’s long heritage 
of football, you will know there has 
been quite a rivalry for a long time. 
Roger graduated from college and went 
to law school. When he finished up law 
school in 1971, he enlisted in the U.S. 
Army right in the middle of the Viet-
nam era. He served 2 years in the 
Army, working as a lawyer. He then 
served 6 more years in the Reserves 
after that. He retired as Captain Bev-
erage. He is also a person who has 
never been shy or would walk away 
from a challenge and is one who has 
constantly been focused on service. 
In the middle of times that people up 
here in Washington, DC, wanted to 
equate 
big 
banks 
and 
community 
banks the same and to say: Let’s put 
the pressure on the big banks but 
‘‘leave the little banks alone,’’ often 
the little banks got caught up in that 
fight, and he was one of the folks who 
was constantly stepping out and say-
ing: Allow community banks to serve 
communities. 
In rural communities, like many of 
mine in Oklahoma, that bank was es-
sential to the economic development of 
what is happening in farming, in ranch-
ing; what is happening in every single 
person getting access to a car loan or a 
home loan or just being that friend 
when they need a chance to talk about 
financial advice. 
Now, Roger is a leader, and you can 
imagine, with bankers, who all have

lots of opinions and lots of great lead-
ers, he didn’t agree with everybody all 
the time, but I would tell you some-
thing I know about Roger: He always 
listened. Always. 
People would ask me about Roger 
and what I think of him, and I would 
say: He is a servant leader. He is a hard 
worker. He is a person who listens. He 
has strong opinions, but his strong 
opinions are based on his own experi-
ence in the facts of the day, but he is 
also a humble worker who is actually 
working for the best of everyone. 
He will be missed in my State—21 
years of serving in the State chamber 
and leadership in so many areas in our 
State—but I am grateful today and in 
the days ahead that he is going to fi-
nally get a chance to just be grandpa 
and hang out with those 12 grand-
children. 
Enjoy those days, Roger. Thank you 
for what you have done to be able to 
help lead our State in this area and to 
be able to serve so many community 
bankers all across the Nation. 
I yield the floor.

NORD STREAM 2 PIPELINE 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, as 
the disasters pile up left and right from 
these early months of the Biden Presi-
dency, one might be called the Tail of 
Three Pipelines—three separate pipe-
lines, three separate challenges, united 
by one consistent theme. In each case, 
the foolishness and weakness of the 
Biden administration has led to the 
disaster. 
First, President Biden began his ad-
ministration by killing the Keystone 
XL Pipeline on day one. This decision 
was a gift to the radical environ-
mentalist nonprofit industry in Wash-
ington, DC, and destroyed thousands of 
good, high-paying, blue-collar, Amer-
ican jobs, including many jobs in my 
home State of Arkansas. 
Second, last week Russian-affiliated 
hackers attacked the Colonial Pipe-
line—an artery that supplies nearly 
half the fuel for the east coast—caus-
ing widespread gas shortages across the 
Southeast. 
Instead of making the hackers feel 
the full wrath of the U.S. Government, 
the Biden administration called the at-
tack a private sector concern. Colonial 
then paid the hackers over $4 million 
in ransom, presumably with Biden ad-
ministration foreknowledge and acqui-
escence, if not explicit support. This 
payment, of course, will only encour-
age further such attacks on American 
companies. 
Third and finally, yesterday the 
Biden administration announced it will 
waive major, legally mandated sanc-
tions against the Russian Nord Stream 
2 Pipeline into Germany. This refusal 
to implement sanctions approved by 
Congress directly benefits by design 
the Russian company building Nord 
Stream 2 and its CEO, who—you won’t 
believe it—is a former Communist, 
East German Stasi officer and long-
time crony of Vladimir Putin. 
President Biden’s decision to cave on 
Nord Stream 2 is just the latest show 
of weakness towards Russia by this ad-
ministration, which is strange, coming 
from a party that spent the last 4 years 
all chesty and boastful, pretending 
they were Jack Ryan in a Tom Clancy 
novel. 
Nord Stream 2 will serve as a noose 
around the neck of Europe’s energy 
supply. It will allow Russia to squeeze 
the sovereign nations of Eastern and 
Central Europe into submission. 
You may think I am exaggerating, 
but Russia has used energy as a weapon 
of foreign policy many times in the 
past. In 2009, for instance, Russia shut 
off the flow of natural gas to Europe 
during a dispute with Ukraine, causing 
energy shortages in the dead of winter. 
Russia has reduced or shut off gas to 
Austria, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, 
and Slovakia whenever those countries 
have refused its demands or otherwise 
displeased the Kremlin. 
Nord Stream 2 will deepen Europe’s 
addiction to Russian gas and make it 
ever more dependent on the dealer. All 
of Europe could suffer, but Ukraine 
would be hurt the most of all. If the 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline comes online, 
Russia could bypass Ukraine entirely. 
This would not only cost Ukraine’s 
economy billions of dollars in transit 
fees, it would also give Russia the abil-
ity to isolate and starve this proud na-
tion. It is hard to imagine a worse time 
for this to happen, with Russian troops 
massed on the Ukrainian border, while 
Russia’s dictator salivates over con-
quering or further partitioning this 
country. 
It is no wonder that the vast major-
ity of Europe sees the dire danger 
posed by this pipeline. The European 
Parliament 
voted 
overwhelmingly 
against it on three separate occasions, 
including just last month. The United 
Kingdom, France, and Eastern Europe 
firmly oppose its construction as well. 
It is only a small but influential group 
of German elites who support this mis-
guided plan. 
It is ironic that these men and 
women of power and privilege would 
doubtlessly claim to support the so- 
called liberal international order, as is 
the fashion in such circles, but their 
actions are directly empowering a dic-
tator who poses the greatest threat to 
their dreams; a man who rose to power 
and has maintained it through extor-
tion, murder, and brutality. 
Putin’s most recent political rival, 
Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with a 
nerve agent and today is rotting in a 
Russian penal colony. Navalny’s only 
crime was exposing the corruption and 
depravity of the Russian state. Yet 
President Biden wants to enrich and 
reward this very regime. 
Ultimately, the pipeline is emblem-
atic of the Biden administration’s 
‘‘America last’’ foreign policy, but 
there is still time to stop it. I am urg-
ing the President to reverse course im-
mediately. There is little room for 
error left at this late, perilous stage. 
Nord Stream 2 is 95 percent completed. 
Like an outstretched arm, Russia’s 
pipeline 
extends 
ominously 
within 
reach of Germany’s shore. We have to 
move quickly and in concert with our 
allies to make sure it extends no fur-
ther. 
This Russian pipeline is bad for 
America and bad for Europe. If the 
President wishes to take the reins of 
international leadership, this is his op-
portunity. Kill Nord Stream 2 now, and 
let it rust beneath the waves of the 
Baltic.

ONLINE PRIVACY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, one of the benefits of vaccine 
rates going up is that school districts 
will no longer have an excuse to keep 
kids and teachers at home for virtual 
learning. But if I know kids—and as a 
mom and a grandmom, I can assure 
you, I understand the kiddos—getting 
them back in the classroom won’t get 
them away from the screens. 
These big tech companies in China 
and the Silicon Valley have done their 
jobs well. For many American kids, de-
vices are integrated into their every-
day lives. There is no escaping that 4- 
inch plate of glass in their pockets. It 
has become a part of their culture. 
Now, this addiction to tech doesn’t 
sit well with many parents and watch-
dogs. We have all heard arguments that 
in order to break this addiction, we 
need to somehow change the culture 
and persuade young people to break 
their own ties with Big Tech. I have a 
different argument: It is Big Tech that 
needs to change its culture. 
As we all know, many of these com-
panies are little more than glorified ad 
agencies. Facebook, Twitter, Google, 
and TikTok have all been successful 
because of their advertising strategies. 
Their job is to get eyeballs on content 
and keep fingers scrolling up and down 
the screen. This means that with every 
shiny new update, their advertising al-
gorithms have also gotten an update. 
The more complex and pervasive 
these tracking figures become, the 
harder it is for users to understand 
what data these companies are col-
lecting and how that data is going to 
be used. Not even tech-savvy adults 
can keep up with the legalese in those 
updated privacy policies. 
I think if I went around this Chamber 
and asked ‘‘When is the last time you 
read the terms of service on an app up-
date?’’ I am willing to bet the answer 
for most of us would be ‘‘Well, it was a 
long time ago,’’ or it could be maybe 
even never. 
Big tech companies have taken ad-
vantage of that, and they have created

within their sphere a culture of push-
ing boundaries. It is do first, apologize 
later, and never ever respond to ques-
tions about their policies with a 
straight answer. 
This Congress, I reintroduced the 
BROWSER Act as a way of pushing 
that culture toward a more consumer- 
friendly consent model. It would re-
quire tech companies to add opt-in and 
opt-out features to their data collec-
tion policies and inject some trans-
parency into the relationship between 
the user and the service provider. It is 
a great place to start and a key ele-
ment of my virtual new protection 
agenda. 
Regulation hasn’t kept up with inno-
vation—that much is clear—but nei-
ther has demand for corporate respon-
sibility and transparency. It is time to 
change that, and I encourage all of my 
colleagues on each side of the aisle to 
take a look at the BROWSER Act. 
But what about those kids? Tech 
companies are increasingly catering to 
young demographics, which means the 
kids are exposed to more of the online 
world every day, which, depending on 
what corner you find yourself in, is a 
productive educational experience, or 
it could be a life-and-death situation. 
Now, the science tells us that, phys-
ically, children do not have the cog-
nitive ability to understand the adver-
tisements and data collection scenarios 
that they are being thrown into. Their 
brains 
are 
simply 
not 
developed 
enough. But the security moms out 
there are keeping an eye on all of this, 
and they will tell you they do not need 
an anatomy lesson to know when their 
child is in over their head. They see 
their children following trails left for 
them by predators, and they are both-
ered. They see their daughters falling 
apart over body image and self-esteem 
issues made worse by photoshopped im-
ages. They see the violence and the 
sexual content in music and movies 
that is created for adults, but children 
are being exposed to this. 
They have a really bad feeling about 
the expanding role of technology in 
their child’s life. The stats and the 
scandals we are seeing every day back 
up their concerns. 
According to Common Sense Re-
search, 98 percent of children in this 
country—98 percent of children in this 
country—under the age of 8 have access 
to a mobile device at home. In 2011, 
just over half of the children had that 
kind of access. This means that 98 per-
cent of children under age 8 are sub-
jected to unprecedented levels of sur-
veillance, data collection, and adver-
tising attacks, even in supposedly kid- 
friendly apps. 
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, 
got caught tracking children on their 
school-provided 
devices 
outside 
of 
school hours. Amazon got caught col-
lecting recordings from children’s Echo 
Dot Kids devices. Parents and regu-
lators have raked Google, TikTok, and 
Facebook over the coals for pushing 
products to children that would in-
crease social media addiction. 
In 2020, the National Center for Miss-
ing and Exploited Children received a 
recordbreaking 21.7 million reports of 
suspected child sexual exploitation, 
and 21.4 million of those reports came 
from electronic service providers. If 
you are looking for the danger, there it 
is. 
During yesterday’s meeting of the 
Commerce Committee’s Consumer Pro-
tection Subcommittee, Baroness Kid-
ron had it right when she said that 
Facebook has not earned our trust, and 
I would encourage my colleagues work-
ing with me on this issue to apply this 
fact to Big Tech in general. 
These companies are entangled in our 
daily lives and in the lives of our chil-
dren, and they have no incentive to 
loosen their grip on our attention by 
making things easier to understand. 
Therefore, we have no incentive to as-
sume they are acting with the interest 
of their customers in mind. 
Remember that terms of service 
agreement we talked about earlier? 
Well, imagine standing by and asking a 
child to read, understand, and make an 
informed choice about whether to click 
the ‘‘accept’’ button. This is prepos-
terous. We need to bring the parents 
back into the conversation and inject 
accountability and transparency into 
the process. 
Last 
Congress, 
I 
introduced 
the 
SAFE DATA Act with my colleagues, 
Senators WICKER, THUNE, and FISHER. 
This bill contained a requirement that 
companies not transfer data collected 
from children between the ages of 13 
and 16 without the explicit consent of 
their parent or guardian. This Con-
gress, I hope my colleagues, Demo-
cratic and Republican, will be willing 
to work with me on similar legislation 
that truly targets this problem of child 
exploitation online. 
We will never change the culture of 
Big Tech—the culture Big Tech has 
created for itself—if we don’t take 
steps right now to deincentivize the 
monetization of children’s attention 
and browsing habits. This is a bipar-
tisan issue. 
The Zuckerbergs and the Dorseys and 
the Pichais of the world who have come 
to testify before the Commerce Com-
mittee—they understand this. It wasn’t 
a pleasant experience for them, but I 
do believe they have gotten the point. 
They need to understand that when it 
comes to privacy and safety mistakes, 
there is no safe harbor to be found here 
in the U.S. Senate, especially when it 
concerns the exploitation of our pre-
cious children. 
What we have going on is going to be 
even more unpleasant when these secu-
rity moms start upping the ante and 
start cutting off the flow of all that 
valuable underage data that is pro-
duced by their children online that is 
being data-mined by these big tech 
companies and then sold to advertisers, 
sold to the highest bidder. That is the 
breaking point we are rapidly ap-
proaching. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I be permitted 
to complete my remarks before the 
scheduled vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CICADAS 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am 
fortunate enough to live in Baltimore, 
and I say that because I can commute 
every night to home, which is a real 
pleasure, to be able to be with my fam-
ily in the evening. My wife Myrna and 
I normally take a morning walk before 
I start the day, and I can get the morn-
ing report from my neighbors as to 
what is on their minds. 
So, this morning, you might be sur-
prised to learn that the major topic of 
discussion was the Brood X, also known 
as the cicadas. These are the cicadas 
that appear every 17 years. Now, I must 
tell you, that became our subject be-
cause we were all trying to avoid step-
ping on them as we were walking. 
Most of us would describe world 
events of the past calendar year as un-
precedented, and this characterization 
is not wrong. For public health, for the 
economy, and for our democracy, the 
year 2021 has indeed brought us chal-
lenges previously unimaginable. How-
ever, 2021 also marks a predictably pre-
dictable 
natural 
phenomenon: 
the 
emergence of what is known as the 17- 
year cicadas. Reliably, every 17 years, 
these insects emerge in the Mid-Atlan-
tic in droves. People greet their visits 
with equal amounts of scorn and ex-
citement. Some of that is depending 
upon age. 
I hope that we can use this 17-year 
marker to celebrate the scientific con-
tributions of an unappreciated Mary-
lander and reflect more broadly on the 
history of the relationship between hu-
mans and the natural environment in 
the Mid-Atlantic, especially the Chesa-
peake Bay. 
Maryland sees the highest concentra-
tion of cicadas on the east coast. Sci-
entists estimate that in some places, 
we have more than 25 or 30 cicadas per 
square foot or more than 1 million per 
acre. In addition to this astonishing 
quantity, male cicadas will perform a 
mating song that, in large groups, can 
reach the same decibel level as a lawn-
mower. 
The cicadas’ visits last only a matter 
of weeks for the purpose of mating, 
molting, and laying eggs that will 
eventually burrow into the ground and 
repeat the process in another 17 years. 
In the words of prominent Maryland 
scientist Benjamin Banneker, ‘‘If their 
lives are short, they are merry,’’ not-
ing that ‘‘they still continue on singing 
till they die.’’ 
Benjamin Banneker’s original hand-
written document describing the cica-
das in 1800 is at the Maryland Center 
for History and Culture in Baltimore. 
He accurately predicted the next 17- 
year cycles. Over the course of his life, 
he witnessed four 17-year cycles of ci-
cadas. Benjamin Banneker may have

been the first scientist to observe and 
record the 17-year lifecycle of cicadas. 
Banneker was born in 1731. His fa-
ther, Robert Bannaky, was a formerly 
enslaved Black man. His mother Mary 
was a free woman of mixed racial herit-
age. 
Banneker demonstrated a keen inter-
est in the sciences after his maternal 
grandmother taught him to read and 
write, and he continued his education 
at a Quaker schoolhouse in Baltimore 
County. He quickly excelled in the area 
of mathematics and astronomy and is 
now considered one of the first African- 
American intellects to gain widespread 
fame. 
He is probably best known for au-
thorizing a series of commercially suc-
cessful farmers’ almanacs that pre-
dicted weather and tidal patterns for 
farmers and fishermen. Banneker also 
predicted lunar and solar eclipses, con-
tributed to surveying the land for the 
U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, and re-
portedly built the first domestically 
produced wooden clock in the country. 
In addition to his contributions to 
science and agriculture, Banneker ad-
vocated for abolition in a series of let-
ters 
he 
exchanged 
with 
President 
Thomas Jefferson. 
Mainstream 
historical 
narratives 
have largely excluded Banneker’s ac-
complishments as a prominent Black 
intellect in the early days of our Na-
tion. As we consider the enormous in-
terest in the arrival of cicadas, it is ap-
propriate 
that 
we 
acknowledge 
Banneker’s early leading role in pre-
dicting the 17-year cycle. 
There are few historical artifacts 
from Banneker’s home in Maryland, 
which burned down shortly after his 
death. Fortunately, we have the Ben-
jamin Banneker Historical Park and 
Museum in Catonsville, MD, which Bal-
timore County administers. The park 
tells the story of his remarkable life 
and the impact the natural environ-
ment of the Chesapeake Bay had in 
sparking his intellectual curiosity. 
Maryland 
Governor 
Larry 
Hogan 
issued a proclamation declaring May 
and June 2021 as Maryland Magicicada 
Months to recognize the return of the 
17-year periodical cicadas and to gen-
erate public awareness about this phe-
nomena. 
Fortunately, cicadas’ buzz is worse 
than their bite. Cicadas do not chew, 
bite, or sting, so they are not a threat 
to humans, pets, animals, or most 
plants. 
The unit of time marked by the ar-
rival of the periodic cicadas in the re-
gion is a useful interval to observe how 
the local environment has changed 
over time. 
Two years after the last emergence of 
cicadas in 2006 was the first year the 
University of Maryland Center for En-
vironmental Science’s report card was 
released. The habitat health values 
were generally poor overall in 2006, 
with a dramatic reduction in bay 
grasses. In 2019, the overall score for 
Chesapeake Bay was a C-minus. This 
means the bay is in moderate health 
and is slightly improving over time. 
For its first ever score, the Chesapeake 
Bay scored B-minus. That means the 
larger watershed is in good health. 
The path to success for Chesapeake 
Bay’s restoration remains steep and is 
only becoming more challenging due to 
the harmful effects of climate change. 
Warmer and wetter weather conditions 
work against progress on removing pol-
lutants and creating habitats condu-
cive 
to 
population 
regrowth. 
The 
Chesapeake Bay Clean Water Blueprint 
set forth a timeline for the six water-
shed jurisdictions that end in 2025. 
Now more than ever, we need State, 
local, and Federal partners working in 
tandem to meet these goals. The 
Chesapeake Bay Program will play a 
central role in that effort, bringing 
various Federal Agencies, State and 
local governments, and nonprofit orga-
nizations together to meet these goals. 
A 17-year review of progress for the 
Chesapeake Bay should energize the 
community to work hard to meet our 
goals. In order to do so, we need the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
to play its role as the referee for the 
Chesapeake Bay Program. The success 
of the effort depends on the stringent 
enforcement of statewide pollution re-
duction plans by the EPA. 
As we consider the next arrival of ci-
cadas in the area in 2038, it is impos-
sible not to look ahead to the climate 
goals the Biden administration has 
enumerated. By 2030, President Biden 
has pledged that the United States 
should have reduced economy-wide net 
greenhouse gas pollution by 50 to 52 
percent. This goal is also referred to as 
the nationally determined contribu-
tion, which is formally submitted to 
United Nations Framework Convention 
on Climate Change. President Biden 
made this announcement during the 
Leaders Summit on Climate, which 
serves to demonstrate the return of the 
United States to leadership on climate 
issues. 
The natural environment is probably 
one of the most obvious markers of the 
passage of time and provides an appro-
priate moment of reflection. Seasonal 
changes, growing trees and crops, and 
even the arrival of the cicadas can push 
us to acknowledge where we have met 
our objectives and where we have fallen 
short on our goals. In terms of our 
local and global environmental res-
toration goals, we have a lot of work to 
do before 2037. 
TRIBUTE TO LOUISE FOSTER 
Madam President, as we reflect on 
change, I would like to take this oppor-
tunity to congratulate a member of my 
personal staff, Louise Foster, on her 
matriculation at Columbia University 
School of International and Public Af-
fairs this fall. 
‘‘Weezie,’’ as everyone who knows her 
calls her, has spent the last 3 years 
providing outstanding public service in 
my Washington, DC, office, first as a 
staff assistant on the frontline of con-
stituent service and now as a legisla-
tive aide, applying science to environ-
mental and infrastructure policy. 
While my staff and I will miss her, we 
wish her the very best of luck and a lit-
tle cicada magic in her academic pur-
suits. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1517 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 
up to 2 minutes of debate, equally di-
vided on amendment 1517. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 2 min-
utes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
would like to thank Senator TILLIS for 
working with me on this amendment, 
amendment No. 1517, to the U.S. Inno-
vation and Competition Act, which 
comes from our work on the IDEA Act, 
a bill that passed the Judiciary Com-
mittee last month with bipartisan sup-
port. 
Promoting innovation is key to en-
suring the United States remains com-
petitive in an increasingly competitive 
global economy. Unfortunately, the 
limited data that is available suggests 
large segments of American society are 
not engaging with a key component of 
the innovation economy, the U.S. pat-
ent system. 
Women make up only 13 percent of 
inventors. Black and Hispanic college 
graduates patent at approximately half 
the rate of their White counterparts. 
Closing 
these 
patent 
gaps 
would 
turbocharge the U.S. economy. 
One study found that including more 
women and Black Americans in the 
early stages of innovation could grow 
our economy by 3.3 percent. Hold that 
thought. Another found that elimi-
nating the patent gap for women with 
science and engineering degrees alone 
would grow the economy by another 2.7 
percent. We are talking about hundreds 
of billions of dollars of growth to our 
economy. 
But if we have any hope of closing 
these patent gaps, we must first get a 
firm grasp on who is and who is not 
using the patent system. Unfortu-
nately, the PTO—Patent and Trade-
mark Office—does not collect demo-
graphic data on applicants. As a result, 
researchers are forced to guess an ap-
plicant’s gender based on his or her 
name, determine an applicant’s race by 
cross-referencing census data, or ex-
plore other options that are time-con-
suming, unreliable, or both. 
Our amendment solves this problem. 
It would enable the PTO to collect de-
mographic data from patent applicants 
on a volunteer basis. I want to repeat 
that. This is on a volunteer basis. No-
body is forcing anyone to provide this 
kind of information. This data could 
then be analyzed by the PTO and out-
side researchers to identify where pat-
ent gaps exist and how to address 
them. 
Let me be clear. Simply providing re-
searchers more data would not solve

the patent gaps facing women, racial

OFFICER

The

Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, there are 
inventors in Colorado and Hawaii and 
across this Nation whom we don’t even 
know about because the fact is, we 
have missed the opportunity to engage 
more people and have more diverse in-
ventors. 
We have to look at this from several 
different perspectives. Let’s look at it 
from a national security perspective. 
I have chaired the Intellectual Prop-
erty Subcommittee for the last two 
Congresses. We heard endless reports of 
how China is churning out patents and 
more 
and 
more 
patents, 
breaking 
records every day. This commonsense 
amendment does nothing more than 
allow people to submit information 
that we can use to get a better beat on 
communities that we need to get into 
to create more intellectual property, to 
create more patents, and to get more 
people engaged in the patents and in-
tellectual property system. With this 
bill, I believe we will make great 
strides. 
I hope everybody will vote for this 
amendment. 
Thank you.

AMENDMENT NO. 1547 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 
up to 2 minutes of debate, equally di-
vided, on amendment No. 1547. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
was 
dev-
astating to our Nation and Congress 
came together in a bipartisan fashion 
to provide unprecedented relief for 2020. 
Unfortunately, 
Democrats 
ditched 
that bipartisan approach in their so- 
called COVID bill, the American Res-
cue Plan, which was full of wasteful 
spending which has nothing to do with 
the crisis. It didn’t receive a single Re-
publican vote. Only 10 percent of the 
funds in the American Rescue Plan are 
related to COVID–19 and spending for 
vaccines is less than 1 percent. 
With our Nation nearly $30 trillion in 
debt and rising inflation, this spending 
is irresponsible and reckless. 
One of the more ridiculous examples 
of waste was $350 billion included for 
State and local bailouts, even though 
our States are doing just fine. In fact, 
California just announced it will have a 
$75 billion surplus. Reckless spending 
has consequences, and we need to be 
fiscally responsible in every use of tax-
payer dollars. 
This amendment would simply pay 
for the U.S. Innovation and Competi-
tion Act and all provisions of this bill 
by 
using 
unobligated, 
unnecessary 
funding for the American Rescue Plan. 
I ask for your support. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
enjoy working with my colleague from 
Florida on many issues, but on this 
particular issue, I disagree. 
This amendment harms both my 
State and our Nation. It literally is 
saying: Take the money that went to 
local governments in the rescue plan 
and repeal it to pay for the Endless 
Frontier Act. 
It said by the date of the enactment 
of this, if that money is repealed, it 
can go and take other money that was 
part of the recovery plan that isn’t 
spent and start taking money from it. 
I think this is the wrong way to do 
that. This would take money imme-
diately away from Tribes. It would 
take money away from healthcare. It 
would 
take 
money 
away 
from 
broadband and, eventually, it could 
take money away from things like 
aerospace, manufacturing, and money 
that is there for the people who have 
been impacted by the downturn who no 
longer have jobs and need to be re-
trained and skilled. 
I think we should pay for the Endless 
Frontier Act as our appropriator col-
leagues will get the chance. Please 
don’t ruin this bill by basically trying 
to pay for it with repealing State dol-
lars.

S2770 
May 19, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 226 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I am proud to stand today in sup-
port of our great ally Israel. Israel is a 
vibrant democracy that supports cap-
italism, champions human rights, and 
holds free and open elections. Since its 
reestablishment in 1948, the United 
States has been Israel’s most fervent 
supporter, and my home State of Flor-
ida has maintained a strong relation-
ship 
with 
Israel 
throughout 
these 
years. 
As Governor, I took a stand against 
discrimination and prohibited State 
agencies and local governments from 
contracting with companies boycotting 
Israel. I also signed legislation to en-
sure the State of Florida will not sup-
port those who participate in the BDS 
movement. 
I traveled to Israel three times as the 
Governor of Florida to support our 
strong economic partnership and cele-
brate the opening of the new Embassy 
in 
Jerusalem. 
Israel’s 
economic 
strength is key to its ability to defend 
itself and our common interests. 
Last Congress, I was proud to cospon-
sor a bill recognizing Israel’s sov-
ereignty over the Golan Heights and 
also supported the Eastern Mediterra-
nean Security and Energy Partnership 
Act to promote security and energy 
partnerships in the Eastern Mediterra-
nean. 
While 
I 
visited 
Israel 
numerous 
times, my most recent trip as Senator 
gave me a clear perspective on Israel’s 
proximity 
to 
its 
enemies 
Hamas, 
Hezbollah, ISIS, and Iran. For decades, 
the people of Israel have endured 
unyielding 
attacks 
from 
terrorist 
groups, like Hamas, which with Iran’s 
support and funding wish to destroy 
the Jewish State and its people. 
Now, as thousands of rockets rain 
down, our resolve to stand with Israel 
must be stronger than ever. I want to 
be clear: Israel has every right to de-
fend and protect its people from ter-
rorist attacks and to do whatever is 
necessary to stop the murder of its 
citizens and foreign nationals residing 
in Israel. 
No country—certainly not the United 
States—would allow the murder of its 
citizens. The terrorists blasting these 
rockets into Israel are the same terror-
ists that chant ‘‘Death to America.’’ 
They don’t believe in democracy, and 
they want Israel wiped off the face of 
the Earth. As our great ally and the 
only shining example of democracy in 
the Middle East, Israel deserves our 
full support. Today and every day, the 
United States must align with those 
fighting for freedom and democracy, 
clearly denounce terrorism, and stand 
up against those who do not respect 
human rights. 
The Trump administration made tre-
mendous efforts to facilitate peace and 
prosperity 
between 
our 
great 
ally 
Israel and neighboring Arab nations, 
but we see the Biden administration 
trying to unravel this progress and ap-
pease illegitimate Palestinian leaders, 
demonstrating once again the Demo-
crats’ reckless disregard for the secu-
rity and prosperity of Israel. 
The Palestinian leadership, which 
has been operating as a dictatorship for 
15 years, had their last election for 
President in 2005. Biden has restored 
U.S. aid to the Palestinians, who open-
ly support terrorism, wage war against 
Israel, and do not recognize its exist-
ence. 
I am disgusted to see the anti-Israel 
agenda being pushed by the radical 
left. The Biden administration can’t go 
down this path. They need to stop try-
ing to rejoin the horrible Iran deal. 
Biden needs to stop his weak and mis-
guided strategy and keep maximum 
pressure on the Ayatollah until Iran is 
no longer a threat to U.S. national se-
curity. 
Israel 
deserves 
our 
full 
support; 
Israel deserves the right to peace and 
security; Israel deserves the right to 
protect its people from reprehensible 
terrorist attacks; and Israel deserves 
the right to take whatever means are 
necessary to stop the murder of its 
citizens and foreign nationals residing 
in Israel. 
Because we have no greater ally in 
our efforts to preserve peace and secure 
our interests in the Middle East, I am 
proud to lead 29 of my colleagues today 
to condemn the escalating attacks by 
Hamas against Israel and thank them 
for joining me on this effort. 
The resolution reaffirms the unwav-
ering commitment of the United States 
to Israel and its right to take whatever 
means necessary to stop the murder of 
its citizens and foreign nationals resid-
ing in Israel. It is time for the U.S. 
Senate to say that enough is enough 
and unanimously adopt this resolution 
to make it clear that the United States 
stands with Israel. These terrorists 
need to know that acts of aggression 
toward Israel will never be tolerated. 
President Biden should take imme-
diate action to remind these terrorists 
and the world of the strong and unwav-
ering support of the United States for 
the Israeli people, and we should stop 
cowering to the anti-Israel radical left. 
I look forward to my colleagues join-
ing me today to stand with Israel. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
S. Res. 226, submitted earlier today. I 
further ask that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SANDERS. Reserving the right 
to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object, and I will 
object to the unanimous consent re-
quest by Senator SCOTT and offer my 
own resolution. Unlike Senator SCOTT’s 
resolution, mine is short and to the 
point, and I think it expresses the feel-
ings of the overwhelming majority of 
people in our country and, in fact, 
throughout the world. 
This is what our resolution says: 
Whereas every Palestinian life matters; 
and 
Whereas every Israeli life matters: 
Now, therefore be it resolved that the Sen-
ate urges an immediate cease-fire to prevent 
any further loss of life; and further esca-
lation of conflict in Israel and the Pales-
tinian territories, and supports diplomatic 
efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian con-
flict, to uphold international law and to pro-
tect the human rights of Israelis and Pal-
estinians. 
I would like to thank my colleagues 
Senator WARREN, Senator VAN HOLLEN, 
Senator KAINE, Senator CARPER, Sen-
ator HEINRICH, Senator MURPHY, Sen-
ator MERKLEY, Senator OSSOFF, Sen-
ator LEAHY, and Senator MARKEY for 
cosponsoring this resolution. 
I would also like to point out that 
those of us who are supporting an im-
mediate cease-fire are certainly not 
alone. We join with nearly unanimous 
calls from the European Union, with 
United Nations Secretary General An-
tonio Guterres, with Pope Francis, and 
with many others. In other words, all 
over the world people are seeing the 
terrible tragedy that is taking place in 
the region, and they want an end to it 
as quickly as possible through a cease- 
fire. 
Now, I happened to have read Sen-
ator SCOTT’s resolution, and I was par-
ticularly struck by one sentence in it 
on page 2. What it says: 
The Senate mourns the loss of innocent 
life caused by Hamas’ rocket attacks. 
That is on page 2. Now, I certainly 
agree with that, and I think every 
Member of Congress agrees with that. 
The loss of 12 innocent Israeli lives is, 
in fact, a tragedy. 
But what about the loss of 227 Pales-
tinian lives, including 64 children and 
38 women? Does Senator SCOTT not be-
lieve that the loss of those Palestinian 
lives, 64 children and 38 women, among 
others, is not a tragedy? 
I believe that we should be mourning 
the loss of Israeli life, but we should 
also be mourning the loss of Pales-
tinian lives or perhaps some people 
think that Palestinian lives don’t mat-
ter. I would hope not. 
And let us be very clear that when we 
talk about the tragedy that is now tak-
ing place in Gaza, what we are talking 
about is not only the terrible loss of 
life. As I hope most people know, Gaza, 
before this war, was an extremely poor 
and desperate community, and the lat-
est Israeli bombardment has only made 
a bad situation much, much worse. 
Let us remember, Gaza has been 
under a blockade since 2007, imposed by 
Israel and Egypt. Most people are un-
able to leave. Basic necessities are ex-
tremely hard to obtain. 
Gaza is the home to about 2 million 
inhabitants. Its population density is 
among the highest in the world—just a

huge amount of people squeezed into a 
very small area. More than half of the 
population of Gaza, some 56 percent, 
live below the poverty line. Seventy 
percent of the population is receiving 
aid, according to estimates by the 
United Nations. Food rations con-
stitute most of that aid. Unemploy-
ment in Gaza is around 45 percent; 48 
percent of the population is under the 
age of 18; and 70 percent—let me re-
peat—70 percent of the young people in 
Gaza are unemployed, with no hope for 
the future. 
And because of this war, the bom-
bardment from Israeli planes, the situ-
ation has gotten even worse. 
Today’s New York Times reports that 
the Israeli bombardment has—this is 
from the New York Times—‘‘damaged 
17 hospitals and clinics in Gaza.’’ Got 
that? Seventeen hospitals and clinics 
have been damaged. 
The bombardment has ‘‘wrecked its 
only coronavirus test laboratory, sent 
fetid wastewater into its streets and 
broken water pipes serving at least 
800,000 people. Sewage systems inside 
Gaza have been destroyed. A desalina-
tion plant that helped provide fresh 
water to [a quarter of a million] people 
in the territory is offline. Dozens of 
schools have been damaged or closed, 
forcing some 600,000 students to miss 
classes. Some 72,000 Gazans have been 
forced to flee their homes.’’ 
That is from the New York Times 
this morning. Perhaps the situation 
has gotten even worse. I don’t know. I 
want everybody to think for a moment 
what it means to be living in a very 
small territory, with dozens and dozens 
of planes attacking and bombing. What 
does it mean, in particular, to the chil-
dren of Gaza? 
Jess Ghannam, a professor of psychi-
atry at the University of California 
San Francisco who specializes in the 
psychological effects of armed conflict 
on children, told USA Today: 
[What] children in Gaza are exposed to on 
a regular basis exceeds anything, anything 
that any children anywhere else in the world 
experience. There’s basically no place to go 
for these children. They are unable to es-
cape. 
When you put people under this sort 
of continued, intense pressure, with no 
hope for a better future, you cannot be 
surprised when violence erupts. Indeed, 
3 years ago, in May of 2018, I wrote a 
letter, with 12 of my colleagues, urging 
the Trump administration to do more 
to alleviate the ongoing humanitarian 
crisis in Gaza. In that letter, we cited 
Israeli defense officials—Israeli defense 
officials—who were warning that if the 
crisis was not addressed, it could lead 
to yet another eruption of violence. 
Why didn’t we take notice then? And 
when this latest war ends, will the 
United States once again turn away? 
Will we consign those children, once 
again, to the horrible conditions they 
are forced to live under today? And I 
would hope that my colleagues appre-
ciate that we must not do that. 
Senator SCOTT’s resolution says a lot 
about Hamas terrorists in Gaza. And 
let us be clear, Hamas is a terrorist or-
ganization. It is a corrupt organiza-
tion, and it is a repressive organiza-
tion. But here is the irony: It is resolu-
tions like Senator SCOTT’s that help 
Hamas. Hamas would be overjoyed if 
Senator SCOTT’s resolution were to 
pass. 
Now, why is that? Let us understand 
that one of Hamas’s goals is to show 
Palestinians that they represent the 
real resistance to the occupation. Sen-
ator SCOTT’s resolution would help 
them do just that. By making this all 
about Hamas, Hamas, Hamas, Senator 
SCOTT is effectively echoing Hamas’s 
own argument that Hamas is the true 
face of Palestinians’ struggle, and I re-
ject that, because, my friends, day 
after day, year after year, decade after 
decade, nonviolent Palestinian activ-
ists struggle against the daily violence 
and harassment of occupation—vio-
lence and harassment subsidized, by 
the way, with billions of U.S. taxpayer 
dollars. 
Let us be very clear. No one is argu-
ing that Israel or any government does 
not have the right to self-defense and 
the responsibility to protect its people. 
We 
should 
understand 
that, 
while 
Hamas’s firing rockets into Israeli 
communities is absolutely unaccept-
able, today’s conflict did not begin 
with those rockets. It goes much, much 
deeper. 
For years we have seen a deepening 
Israeli occupation in the West Bank 
and East Jerusalem and a perpetual 
blockade on Gaza, all of which makes 
life increasingly unbearable for the 
Palestinian people. The truth is that 
these policies, like this current war, 
will 
continue 
to 
strengthen—to 
strengthen—extremists on both sides, 
including Hamas. If you want to 
strengthen Hamas, support this war. 
We, Congress, must understand that 
in more than a decade of his rightwing 
rule in Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu has 
cultivated an increasingly intolerant 
and authoritarian-type of racist na-
tionalism. In his frantic effort to stay 
in power and avoid prosecution for cor-
ruption, Netanyahu has legitimized ex-
tremist forces, such as the Jewish 
Power party, by bringing them into the 
government. 
Moreover, we should understand that 
these dangerous trends are not unique 
to Israel. What was going on and what 
is going on in Israel, in my view, is a 
political tragedy, but it is part of a 
trend that is going on around the 
world, including here in the United 
States, where we are seeing the rise of 
authoritarian nationalist movements. 
These movements exploit ethnic and 
racial hatreds in order to build power 
for a corrupt few, rather than pros-
perity, justice, and peace for the many. 
For the last 4 years, these movements 
have had a friend in the Trump White 
House, and on January 6, those forces 
attacked this very Chamber. 
It is no accident that the only Euro-
pean Union country that did not join 
the nearly unanimous statement yes-
terday calling for a cease-fire was Hun-
gary. Hungary did not join the rest of 
the European Union, and Hungary, of 
course, is led by the ethno-nationalist 
authoritarian Viktor Orban, a strong 
ally of both Netanyahu and Donald 
Trump. 
Now, some may choose to be on that 
side, but that is not the side I choose to 
be on. We must be on the side of those 
who want to build a society based on 
real security and political equality and 
based upon the principles of economic 
justice, racial justice, political justice, 
social justice, and environmental jus-
tice. I believe we must stand in soli-
darity with those Palestinians and 
Israelis working to build a future of 
equality and peaceful coexistence and 
not with the intolerant extremists on 
either side, who wish to destroy that 
future. 
In this moment of crisis, the United 
States should be urging an immediate 
cease-fire. My colleagues, I strongly 
believe that the United States has a 
major role to play in helping the world 
build a more peaceful and prosperous 
future, one in which human rights are 
upheld and the life of every human 
being is valued. 
We should be leading the world in 
combating the existential threat of cli-
mate change. We should be leading the 
world in making sure that every person 
on Earth, no matter what country he 
or she lives in, receives a vaccine to 
protect them from the COVID–19 virus, 
and, yes, we should lead the world in 
attempting to bring the Israeli people 
and the Palestinian people together. 
If the United States is going to be a 
credible voice on human rights on the 
global stage, we must recognize that 
Palestinian rights matter. Palestinian 
lives matter. 
Madam President, I object to the 
Scott resolution. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, today is a sad day for the U.S. 
Senate, and one we will not forget. No 
one in this body supports the loss of in-
nocent lives—no one. But let me be 
very clear about what we just wit-
nessed. We just saw the Democratic 
Party completely abandon the sov-
ereignty of Israel in support of a ter-
rorist organization. The radical left is 
fully embracing the lie of false equiva-
lence and refuses to plainly state: 
Israel has the right to defend itself, pe-
riod. 
The resolution I offered today simply 
reaffirms our support of Israel, one of 
our greatest allies and our most impor-
tant ally in the Middle East. And it 
condemns the escalating terrorist at-
tacks against Israel. 
This isn’t controversial. In fact, it is 
in line with everything America has 
stood for, for generations. It is actually 
in line with what my colleague just 
wrote in his op-ed for the New York 
Times. He said: ‘‘No one is arguing that 
Israel, or any government, does not

have the right to self-defense or to pro-
tect its people.’’ So why is he objecting 
to this today? Does he agree with the 
radical left that the United States 
shouldn’t follow through with a crit-
ical arms sale to Israel as it continues 
to face attacks? 
It was not long ago that the Senate, 
including my colleague, stood with 
Israel on a bipartisan basis. In fact, in 
2014, when Israel was again subject to a 
barrage of rockets targeting innocent 
Israelis, then-Majority Leader Reid of-
fered a resolution supporting Israel’s 
right to defend itself against Hamas. 
The 2014 resolution even acknowl-
edges the simple truth that ‘‘Hamas re-
fuses to recognize Israel’s right to 
exist.’’ It also said: ‘‘Hamas refuses to 
recognize Israel’s right to exist.’’ It 
says: ‘‘Hamas uses rockets to indis-
criminately target civilians in Israel.’’ 
It says: ‘‘Hamas intentionally uses ci-
vilians as human shields.’’ And it re-
solved to ‘‘condemn Hamas’s terrorist 
actions.’’ 
The Senate, including my colleague, 
unanimously supported then-Majority 
Leader Reid’s resolution supporting 
Israel’s right to defend itself against 
Hamas and never said at that time that 
the resolution would embolden Hamas. 
Yet, today, something has changed for 
my colleague. You are seeing a growing 
and dangerous anti-Israel agenda per-
meate the Halls of Congress. Israel is a 
country surrounded by nations and ter-
rorist groups that want it wiped off the 
face of the Earth. And as rockets rain 
down in Israel, my colleague refuses to 
stand with our ally. 
I will say it again. Today is a sad day 
for the U.S. Senate and one we will not 
forget. I will never accept a weakened 
position on Israel—never. I will never 
stop fighting to support Israel and en-
sure the Biden administration upholds 
the longstanding and special partner-
ship between the United States and 
Israel. 
I yield the floor. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 225 
Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. Res. 225, submitted earlier 
today; further, that the resolution be 
agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, 
and that the motions to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table with no intervening action or de-
bate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, reserving the right to object, my 
colleague is wrong for trying to boil 
this down in an attempt to distract 
from the reality we are seeing here 
today. 
The radical left is fully embracing 
the lie of false equivalence and refuses 
to plainly state: Israel has the right to 
defend itself, period. 
My 
colleague’s 
resolution 
offers 
nothing supporting Israel’s rightful ef-
forts to stop this repeated cycle of vio-
lence. No one in this body welcomes 
the loss of innocent life—no one. But 
we cannot and I will not accept the 
left’s ignorance of the evil and dev-
astating role Iran plays in funding and 
supporting Hamas, the terrorist orga-
nization responsible for taking inno-
cent lives. 
My 
colleague’s 
resolution 
offers 
nothing to condemn Iran, the world’s 
largest state sponsor of terrorism. My 
colleague’s resolution offers nothing to 
condemn Hamas. 
Here is the difference between Israel 
and Hamas. Hamas uses its rockets to 
kill innocent Israelis. Israel uses its 
rockets to defend its people. It should 
not be difficult for the Senate to sim-
ply reaffirm our support of Israel, one 
of our greatest allies and our most im-
portant ally in the Middle East, and 
condemn the escalating terrorist at-
tacks against Israel and its right to 
end the murder of its citizens. 
It wasn’t difficult to get that done in 
2014, when my colleague and every 
other Member of the Senate unani-
mously supported then-Majority Lead-
er Reid’s resolution supporting Israel’s 
right to defend itself against Hamas. 
The same resolution also said: ‘‘Hamas 
refuses to recognize Israel’s right to 
exist.’’ It says: ‘‘Hamas uses rockets to 
indiscriminately target civilians in 
Israel.’’ And it says: ‘‘Hamas inten-
tionally 
uses 
civilians 
as 
human 
shields.’’ And it resolved to ‘‘condemn 
Hamas’s terrorists actions.’’ 
So what does my colleague believe 
has changed about the facts on the 
ground since then? Here is what has 
changed. The Democrats now have a 
powerful and growing anti-Israel cau-
cus in their party who defend terrorism 
against Israel. The Democratic Party 
has abandoned American values, and 
now they are abandoning American al-
lies. 
And, as I said earlier, we can’t allow 
this dangerous anti-Israel agenda to 
permeate the Halls of Congress. We 
can’t allow a blatant blind eye to be 
turned to Israel. 
Israel is a country surrounded by na-
tions and terrorist groups that want it 
wiped off the face of Earth. I will never 
accept a weakened position on Israel— 
never. And I am not going to stop 
fighting to support Israel and ensure 
the Biden administration upholds a 
longstanding and special partnership 
between the United States and Israel. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
situation in the Middle East is a stark 
contrast from that of just 9 months 
ago. 
Last summer, the United States 
helped broker the Abraham Accords—a 
historic step in the relationship be-
tween Israel and the United Arab Emir-
ates. The UAE became the third Arab 
country—the first Gulf State—to rec-
ognize and normalize relations with 
Israel. Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan 
would follow suit shortly thereafter. 
These 
agreements 
mark 
historic 
progress toward peace in decades and 
appear to open a new era of diplomacy 
in the Middle East. 
Today, though, the optimism we felt 
just a little less than a year ago has 
been replaced with more violence— 
more violence—and more destruction 
than we have seen in years and civilian 
casualties that continue to climb every 
day. 
Hamas has fired thousands of rockets 
into civilian populations in Israel. If 
not for the Iron Dome anti-rocket de-
fense system and the U.S. support and 
funding that made it possible, the 
death toll would be significantly higher 
than it is. 
Just as any sovereign state under at-
tack by terrorist forces would do, 
Israel has defended its citizens. Given 
the way Hamas uses Palestinian civil-
ians as human shields—a war crime, by 
the way, for which Hamas alone is re-
sponsible—the counterstrikes have car-
ried a human cost. 
As the conflict has intensified, some 
of our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle have called into question 
Israel’s right to defend itself. They 
have acted as though there is some 
moral equivalency between the ter-
rorist acts of Hamas and Israel’s right 
to defend itself. They have called on 
the President to speak out against the 
conduct of Israel but not Hamas. It is 
as though they think that Israel is 
somehow a terrorist group, not the 
other way around. 
As I said, Hamas has launched thou-
sands of rockets specifically headed to-
ward civilian targets in Israel. The 
moral equivalency argument between 
Hamas’s attack and Israel’s response is 
clearly divorced from any reality. 
Let’s be clear, though. This conflict 
is not a welcome development for any-
one. The Israeli and the Palestinian 
people are bearing the cost of a conflict 
that they had no hand in creating. 
It is important to remember that two 
things can be true. First, Israel has a 
right to defend itself. If Hamas or any 
other terrorist group or state launches 
an attack on Israel, its government has 
both the right and the responsibility to 
respond and protect its citizens. Sec-
ondly, the number of civilian casual-
ties on both sides, particularly the 
number of children, is heartbreaking. 
Both of those things are true. 
The violence and destruction we are 
seeing is devastating, made even more 
upsetting by the progress we appeared 
to have made just last year. But this is 
not a conflict between two govern-
ments; this is a sovereign state defend-
ing itself against a terrorist attack. 
I am afraid that message has been 
lost on President Biden. When asked 
about the conflict earlier this week, 
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki 
said the administration is using ‘‘quiet 
and intensive diplomacy’’—‘‘quiet and 
intensive diplomacy’’ while the rockets 
are raining down on civilian popu-
lations in Israel. 
The only democracy in the Middle 
East is being attacked by a terrorist

organization, and the diplomatic strat-
egy of the leader of the free world in-
cludes remaining quiet. I am reminded 
of President Obama’s statement—bi-
zarre now, in retrospect—talking about 
‘‘leading from behind,’’ an oxymoronic 
doctrine which gave way to disastrous, 
albeit 
predictable, 
consequences 
in 
Libya. We continued to see the dire 
cost of poor American leadership in 
other foreign countries. In Yemen, in 
Iraq, Syria, and Ukraine, leading from 
behind has done nothing but harm the 
cause of peace. 
I hope this serves as a wake-up call 
for President Biden of the dangers of a 
similar quest. ‘‘Quiet and intensive di-
plomacy’’ is not the appropriate course 
when one of our closest allies in the 
world is being attacked by an inter-
nationally recognized terrorist organi-
zation. 
But we can’t lose sight of the country 
behind the curtain, the silent financier 
of this conflict, which is Iran, the No. 
1 state sponsor of international ter-
rorism, because this is, in fact, a proxy 
war waged against the Jewish State. 
Iran is a prolific state sponsor of ter-
rorism and has felt growing pressure 
from the United States and its allies in 
recent years. The Trump administra-
tion withdrew from the Iran nuclear 
deal and placed sanctions on hundreds 
of businesses and individuals who have 
helped finance Iran’s illicit activities. 
And there is no question that Iran 
stood to lose the most from the peace 
agreements brokered last year. The 
threat of Iran was largely responsible 
for these countries to come together 
and to lay down their arms and to work 
together. 
The Biden administration has made 
clear it intends to recklessly revive the 
Iran deal, while loosening the sanc-
tions that would provide the United 
States leverage to negotiate better 
terms. These important sanctions tar-
get Iran’s support for terrorist groups 
like Hamas, as well as its ballistic mis-
sile development and human rights vio-
lations. 
Removing them now, essentially uni-
laterally, is a grave mistake. Simply 
by signaling this intent, President 
Biden has already emboldened and en-
couraged 
Iran’s 
malign 
activities 
through its proxies—Hamas, Hezbollah, 
and others. 
This current loss of life and destruc-
tion demonstrate that Iran is capable 
of wielding deadly force, even with lean 
resources. Fewer sanctions, though, 
have meant less cash flowing to their 
terrorist proxies. 
This week, we are reminded of the 
saying that has been around for years: 
‘‘If Hamas laid down its weapons today, 
there would be no more violence. If 
Israel laid down its weapons, there 
would be no more Israel.’’ 
America must remain steadfast in 
our commitment to support Israel, as 
well as our responsibility to counter 
threats posed by terrorist organiza-
tions like Hamas and malign nation 
state actors like Iran. 
I hope for a day in the future when 
the Middle East can be a place of 
peace, stability, and democracy, but we 
simply will not reach that point with-
out a strong and secure Israel. 
I stand in full support of Israel and 
will continue to fight for a strong U.S.- 
Israel relationship. The United States 
does not bow down to terrorist organi-
zations, and we will not allow our al-
lies to be bullied and beaten by Hamas 
or any other terrorist group. 
(Mr. OSSOFF assumed the Chair.) 
S. 1260 
Mr. President, on one final matter, 
we know the Endless Frontier legisla-
tion, which is on the floor today, is 
part of our response to the competition 
caused by an increasingly belligerent 
and aggressive China, and I am glad 
the Senate has taken up consideration 
of this legislation. 
In coming days, I expect both sides to 
offer amendments to strengthen this 
legislation and to ensure that it ad-
dresses a broad range of strategic 
threats. As Leader MCCONNELL
has 
said, a robust amendment process is 
critical to the success of this legisla-
tion. 
One of the most pressing needs, 
though, is to bolster our domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing, which 
will be addressed and is addressed by 
the underlying bill. We rely on these 
microelectronic 
circuits, 
or 
semi-
conductors, for everything from our 
telephones that we have in our pockets 
to the cars in our driveways, to the 
missile defense systems that are right 
now knocking down Hamas rockets 
raining down over Israel. 
Over the past couple of decades, as 
our need for semiconductors has in-
creased, as we have become more tech-
nologically centric, so has our depend-
ence on the countries that produce 
those semiconductors. 
Here is a graphic reminder of our de-
pendency on foreign supply chains in 
order to supply these critical semi-
conductors that are so important to 
our economy and to our national secu-
rity. As you can see, 63 percent of the 
global market supply of semiconduc-
tors comes from Taiwan, 18 percent 
comes from South Korea, 6 percent 
from China, but nearly 90 percent of 
chips are sourced from Southeast Asia. 
As we learned in the pandemic called 
COVID–19, vulnerable supply chains are 
something we need to be aware of and 
to fight against. 
I am reminded of what President 
Jimmy Carter said in 1980 in the State 
of the Union Message when he spoke 
about the Persian Gulf and Soviet 
threats to the movement of essential 
energy supplies through the Strait of 
Hormuz. President Carter at that time 
articulated the Carter doctrine, as it 
came to be known. He said: 
An attempt by any outside force to gain 
control of the Persian Gulf region will be re-
garded as an assault on the vital interests of 
the United States of America. 
In other words, it would be an act of 
war because of the dramatic depend-
ence that the United States had at that 
time on oil flowing through the Strait 
of Hormuz. 
But I think you could consider today 
that semiconductors are the new oil. 
Instead of the Strait of Hormuz, we are 
now dependent on a supply chain from 
parts of the world we can no longer de-
pend upon. 
Just as a blockade would have left 
the 
world 
with 
devastating 
con-
sequences, a blockade of the semicon-
ductor supply chain would have far- 
reaching, negative consequences to our 
national security and economy. In fact, 
we are getting a glimpse of what that 
might look like right now. 
There is a global semiconductor 
shortage that is largely related to 
COVID–19 and has led to far-reaching 
consequences across virtually every in-
dustry. In Texas a couple of weeks ago, 
I met with executives from companies 
across the range of industries that 
have been impacted by the shortage of 
semiconductors, including automotive, 
consumer electronics, and defense. 
So we need a strong response to re-
store domestic semiconductor manu-
facturing, which is why last year, Sen-
ator WARNER, the Senator from Vir-
ginia, and I introduced what we call 
the CHIPS for America Act. Thanks to 
the leadership of then-Chairman JIM 
INHOFE on the Senate Armed Services 
Committee, that became law, and it 
will help restore American semicon-
ductor manufacturing by creating a 
Federal incentive to encourage chip 
manufacturing right here in the U.S.A. 
But the thing we couldn’t do then, 
even though the amendment we intro-
duced passed 96 to 4, to authorize this 
Federal incentive program, the one 
thing that was missing was the money 
and the finances in order to make this 
happen. 
My preference is always to fund 
things through the regular order when-
ever possible. We simply cannot get 
into the habit of cutting the Appro-
priations Committee out of the appro-
priations process. But there is clearly 
broad support for the CHIPS for Amer-
ica Act. As I said, 96 Senators voted to 
include it in the Defense Authorization 
Act. 
I am committed to securing funding 
for the program created by the bill, and 
there have been many conversations 
about the alternatives available to us 
on how to do so. 
Originally, we introduced a tax credit 
provision, but unfortunately that did 
not seem to gain the traction that we 
needed. When we tried to get the fund-
ing in December, we came up empty-
handed. 
But today I am glad to say there is a 
significant 
emergency 
appropriation 
included in the underlying bill. But un-
fortunately, politics being what it is 
and Washington being a political city, 
there are unnecessary and purely polit-
ical provisions related to the payment 
of prevailing wages, which U.S. semi-
conductor 
manufacturing 
companies 
already pay their employees, and they

May 19, 2021 
have created a problem for funding this 
noncontroversial measure to bring chip 
production back to American soil. 
I have reached out to our friends 
across the aisle to try to work in good 
faith to reach a compromise that al-
lows this funding to pass with a broad 
bipartisan majority. There is a clear 
and urgent need to bolster domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing and to 
secure one of our most, if not the most, 
critical supply chains. 
Here is what a recent support of the 
National Security Commission on Arti-
ficial Intelligence said: 
[T]he United States is almost entirely reli-
ant on foreign sources for production of cut-
ting-edge semiconductors critical for defense 
systems and industry more broadly, leaving 
the U.S. supply chain vulnerable to disrup-
tion by foreign government action or natural 
disaster. 
It is clear that other countries—no-
tably China—are steadily investing in 
their 
own 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing. Today, as I speak, China is 
building 17 fabs, or manufacturing fa-
cilities, in the People’s Republic of 
China. 
The United States needs to compete, 
and in order to do so, we need to pass 
this essential funding. We should not 
be bogged down by bipartisan or polit-
ical points to be scored when, in fact, 
they really don’t make any difference 
to the semiconductor industry because 
they already pay high wages. The only 
reason to do this is to try to advance 
the interests of organized labor and im-
pose additional costs on the construc-
tion of these advanced fabrication fa-
cilities. 
The fact is, this actually expands the 
role of prevailing wage requirements 
because this is essentially private con-
struction, funded in part—in a modest 
part—by U.S. Federal tax dollars. So 
now is not the time to let politics get 
in the way of our progress. It is just 
simply too important to our country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before 
the Senator from Texas leaves the 
floor, I want to acknowledge that in 
Oklahoma, last Sunday, I was with a 
group of people, and, independent of 
each other, they asked the same ques-
tion: Where is America, and what is 
happening over there right now? Our 
best friend and most loyal ally in that 
part of the world, Israel, is being hit by 
terrorists, and we are sitting back and 
not doing anything. It is just not 
thinkable that that could happen. 
I think one of the most meaningful 
things that I had not heard before, 
stated this way, that the Senator from 
Texas stated was, if Hamas were to 
stop the attacks on Israel, Israel would 
do nothing, but if Israel were to stop 
responding, there would be no Israel 
left. 
That is the situation we have there. 
It is something that is not understand-
able. It is something that we are going 
to do everything we can to reverse. 
That is not why I am here on the 
floor, but I just wanted to mention 
that. 
S. 1260 
Mr. President, on this legislation 
that we are working on right now, we 
have an amendment. Senator SHELBY 
and I, jointly, have an amendment. 
Now, we did this initially because I 
chaired the Senate Armed Services 
Committee 
and 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee, and it is an agreement 
that we had 10 years ago. We agreed on 
parity, that anything that we do that 
is going to be defense-related is going 
to be equaled by nondefense. 
Now, that has been our pattern, 
Democrats and Republicans, for 10 
years, but now the situation has 
changed, the way it is structured now 
in this bill, so that there is nothing in 
there for defense. 
Here we are in the most threatened 
position we have ever been in with 
China. Yet the China bill is doing all 
these things with China, but it is not 
doing anything in terms of the mili-
tary that we are suffering under right 
now. 
We have to remember—a lot of people 
have forgotten this—that two adminis-
trations ago, in the Obama administra-
tion, we had a situation where, during 
the last 5 years—that would have been 
from 2010 to 2015—the President at that 
time, President Obama, had reduced 
the budget for defense by 25 percent. 
During the same timeframe, China had 
increased theirs by 83 percent. 
Now, just look at that. That is what 
was happening. That was back in 2015, 
and now the situation is really getting 
worse because, since that time, China 
has 
increased 
its 
capabilities 
in 
hypersonics and other areas, so that 
they are actually ahead of us in many 
areas. 
So what we want to do is just to be 
sure that, whatever product we come 
out with, we end up having parity be-
tween defense spending and nondefense 
spending. It is something we have been 
doing for a long period of time. 
So the threat has not improved over 
the last 3 years but has only gotten 
worse. I think that any bill that really 
seeks to address the threat from 
China—the whole threat from China— 
must also address China’s very real 
military and its broader military-civil 
fusion that is taking place right now. 
That is why any response can’t sepa-
rate out military and economic com-
petition. It must be whole of govern-
ment. And this bill is only focused on 
economic competition, not military. 
Our amendment, SHELBY’s amend-
ment and mine, will make sure that 
any increase in nondefense, discre-
tionary spending will be matched by 
the same level of increase to the de-
fense spending. Now, this is not some-
thing that is just Republican. This is 
something that was agreed upon some 
10 years ago by Democrats and Repub-
licans. Yet that is not what we are 
looking at with this. So this would 
merely be going back and agreeing 
with what we all agreed to, Democrats 
and Republicans. 
In fact, in this document right here— 
we often refer to this document. This is 
the NDAA document that was put to-
gether, to remind my fellow Members 
here, this was six Democrats and six 
Republicans, all recognized in their 
skills in military planning, coming up 
with this document. This was 2018. Yet, 
today, it is just as applicable as it was 
back then. And that is what they talk 
about—what is necessary this year to 
spend on military to try to keep some 
type of a parity with China. 
Now, this has to be our top priority. 
Our security underwrites everything 
else we do as a nation. That is why 
America is viewed as the leader of the 
free world. It can’t be either one or the 
other. It has got to be both. 
The Chinese are competing against 
us in every area, and this bill currently 
does nothing to bolster our national 
defense to confront this threat or to le-
verage our military and intelligence 
community’s significant research and 
development expertise in this area. It 
doesn’t establish the sort of coopera-
tion between our defense and commer-
cial sectors on technology and techno-
logical development that we need. 
China isn’t just investing in tech-
nology, manufacturing, and research; 
they are also investing in military. 
They are putting more money into 
modernizing their military than ever 
before. China is on a modernization 
sprint. They have been channeling 
money into building weapons that we 
don’t even have yet, like hypersonics. 
I was embarrassed about a year ago 
when China came out and in China, in 
their parade, they were displaying 
hypersonics, things we don’t even have 
yet. That didn’t used to be that way. It 
used to be, following the Second World 
War, that we always kept ahead at that 
time. We recognized that there was a 
risk there and that the risk was some-
thing we had to meet. 
So they are on track to dominate in 
new capabilities like artificial intel-
ligence and hypersonics and other 
areas. So, meanwhile, we are crawling 
forward because we aren’t giving our 
military the resources they need to 
stay competitive with China. 
We know what that looks like. It is 
at least 3 to 5 percent in real growth. 
Now, that is actually what is in this 
document right now. They have up-
dated this to show that right now we 
should, in order to stay even with 
China, be upgrading somewhere be-
tween 3 and 5 percent, this year, in this 
budget. And we are reducing the 
amount. It doesn’t even meet the cost 
of living. 
So in the military advantage—that is 
what we use to deter China from mov-
ing from economic aggression to mili-
tary aggression—we have already lost 
our edge in some areas. So, to maintain 
our military advantage, it is going to 
take investment, but President Biden 
is not willing to make the investment

we need. He is proposing to cut our de-
fense budget, and that doesn’t even 
keep pace with inflation. 
So, meanwhile, he is proposing to in-
crease all other spending almost 20 per-
cent, and in this bill here it spends as 
much on microchips for the auto indus-
try as it does on microelectronics for 
our national defense. Can you believe 
that? 
If we don’t invest in our military de-
terrent, it is hard to see how any of our 
other efforts—diplomacy, innovation, 
economic growth—will succeed either. 
So we will continue to work in a bi-
partisan fashion to address these needs. 
I really believe that this should be the 
first amendment to come up. I don’t 
know. I am not in charge of that. But 
it should be. It is one that should be 
easy to pass because it was agreed to 10 
years ago—that we didn’t need to be in 
a position where we are not keeping up 
with China. 
So our amendment does one simple 
thing. It is parity. It says any change 
that you make in the nondefense 
spending you have to have in defense 
spending at the same time. I believe 
that should happen. It should take 
place. I am hoping that we will have an 
opportunity to vote on that tomorrow. 
With that, I yield the floor.

HONORING FIREMAN SECOND 
CLASS MARTIN DAYMOND YOUNG 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, Navy Fire-
man 2nd Class Martin Daymond Young, 
born on May 11, 1920, was one of nine 
children who grew up in a busy house-
hold in the tiny Dukes community in 
Hancock County, KY. His family said 
their goodbyes when he enlisted in the 
Navy in the summer of 1940 and he 
headed to the South Pacific—to Pearl 
Harbor. 
Sadly, Daymond Young was one of 
the 429 crew members who perished 
aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 
7, 1941. He was 21 years old. The trag-
edy of his death was even more unbear-
able for his family because he was bur-
ied in a mass grave among scores of un-
identified shipmates. 
His siblings and particularly his twin 
sister, Daisy, did all they could to keep 
his memory alive for their children, 
who remember a photo of Daymond in 
his Navy uniform that was always 
proudly displayed in her home. All of 
his nieces and nephews looked up to 
him even though most had never met 
him. 
Beginning 
in 
2015, 
new 
dental, 
anthropologic and mitochondrial DNA 
analyses were employed to identify 
those who had fallen at Pearl Harbor, 
eventually certifying Daymond’s re-
mains in 2019. His family members 
wanted to bury him on what would 
have been his 100th birthday, May 11, 
2020, but the coronavirus pandemic 
made travel and a public ceremony im-
possible. So, finally, on May 15, 2021, 
the remains of Daymond Young re-
turned to beautiful Hancock County, 
KY, where he was buried alongside his 
ever-devoted sister Daisy. Among those 
welcoming him were his nephew, Lay-
man Hawkins, of Lewisport, KY, and 
the many relatives and residents who 
knew him only by his legacy of sac-
rifice for his country. 
The tragedy of war, the unanswered 
questions of forensic science, and even 
the restrictions of a pandemic were ul-
timately unable to separate the re-
mains of this honorable sailor from his 
loving family and the community that 
refused to forget him. Likewise, we are 
honored to remember him, and to this 
returning sailor, we say, ‘‘Welcome 
home. Fair winds and following seas.’’

75TH ANNIVERSARY OF CASPER 
COLLEGE 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
stand today to recognize the 75th anni-
versary of Casper College, a commu-
nity, regional, and State pillar of edu-
cation. Casper College is one of Wyo-
ming’s great educational institutions, 
with the mission of ‘‘Education for a 
Lifetime.’’ 
Casper College was the first commu-
nity college in Wyoming. The idea for 
the college began following World War 
I. After 19 years of study and debate, a 
measure to establish the college was 
passed by the Wyoming Legislature. It 
was signed into law in February 1945 by 
then-Governor Lester C. Hunt. Casper 
Junior College opened in 1945 on the 
third floor of the Natrona County High 
School building. Timing was ripe for 
Casper College to meet the demands of 
the ‘‘greatest generation’’ of service 
men and women who were eligible for 
the newly offered GI bill. Since that 
time, Casper College has continued 
that same spirited mission. The college 
is an incredible success story, growing 
into one of the largest and most com-
prehensive community colleges in the 
Rocky Mountain West. 
In 1955, the rapidly expanding 2-year 
school moved to its present location on 
the 
hills 
below 
Casper 
Mountain. 
Today, the campus comprises 28 build-
ings on more than 200 acres. Casper 
College offers more than 140 academic 
transfer and technical and career pro-
grams. Eleven universities offer ad-
vanced 
degrees 
through 
university 
partnership programs. There are 40 
University 
of 
Wyoming 
programs 
through the Casper College 2+2 Degree 
plan. 
Casper College has received numer-
ous awards and national recognition. 
In 2020, the College Consensus named 
Casper College one of the Fifty Best 
Community Colleges in the United 
States. The school was also named the 
ninth-best community college in the 
Nation in a recent study conducted by 
the personal finance outlet WalletHub. 
This study recognizes where students 
can receive the best education at the 
lowest price. In 2021, Great Value Col-
leges named Casper College as one of 
America’s most beautiful community 
college campuses. 
Casper College’s core values are in-
tegrity, 
people, 
diversity, 
forward- 
thinking, 
and 
community. 
Alumni 
leaders include former Vice President 
of the United States Dick Cheney, the 
late country singer and rodeo cowboy 
Chris LeDoux, artist Chris Navarro, re-
nowned entomoligist Wayne Hunter, 
and Marlan Scully, American physicist 
best known for his work in theoretical 
quantum optics. The alumni list also 
includes former professional athletes 
Earle Higgins, Bob Lackey, and Flynn 
Robinson. With over 4,000 students 
each semester, Casper college will con-
tinue to produce outstanding artists, 
athletes, academics, and professionals. 
Under the direction and guidance of 
President Darren Divine, staff, and fac-
ulty, Casper College continues a tradi-
tion of excellence started by the found-
ers 75 years ago. They are educating, 
teaching, and training the next genera-
tion of leaders and professionals. The 
college board of trustees are Chair 
Steve Degenfelder, Vice Chair Tim 
Kugle, Secretary Sue Schilling, and 
Trustees Kathy Dolan, Liz Batton, 
Scott Bennion, and Susan D. Miller. 
Student Senate leaders for this anni-
versary year are President Anastacia 
Slack, School of Business & Industry; 
Bre Long and Dylan Cornelius, School 
of Fine Arts & Humanities; Tierra 
Price and Jakob Duncan, School of 
Health Science; Madelyn Polys and 
Morgan Bundy, School of Science; 
Emma Mercer and Abby Hudman, 
School of Social & Behavioral Science; 
Logan 
MacKearney 
and 
Charissa 
Parker, 
Freshman 
Representatives; 
and members Paige Noble and Dani 
Warner.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING THE FIRST ALL-FE-
MALE NO. 1 SINGLE IN COUNTRY 
MUSIC 
∑ Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, in 
Music City, we have a saying: ‘‘It all 
begins with a song.’’ It is our universal 
truth and the foundation of hundreds 
of iconic moments in country music. 
This year, we have the privilege of 
celebrating the breakthrough of one of 
Nashville’s most promising young art-
ists. Her moment appropriately began 
with a very special song and a very spe-
cial group of songwriters. 
It is my pleasure to recognize for the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the first song 
in country music written, performed, 
and produced by an all-female team to 
hit the No. 1 spot on the charts. 
Congratulations to songwriter and 
performer Tenille Arts, songwriter Al-
lison Cruz, and songwriter and pro-
ducer Alex Kline on the historic suc-
cess of ‘‘Somebody Like That.’’ On be-
half of the entire Tennessee congres-
sional delegation, I thank you for your 
stunning contribution to the beau-
tifully 
female 
future 
of 
country 
music.∑

TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER JAEGER 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I rise to recognize one of my State’s in-
credible educators, Jennifer Jaeger, 
who announced her retirement after al-
most three decades of work in the 
Clark County School District. 
A native Nevadan, Mrs. Jaeger was 
born and raised in Las Vegas and began 
her work in education at UNLV, where 
she earned a bachelor’s degree in sec-
ondary education and a master’s degree 
in middle level education and edu-
cational leadership. Since obtaining 
her educator license, Mrs. Jaeger has 
worked in four different Las Vegas 
schools in capacities ranging from dean 
of students to assistant principal to, 
presently, principal of the Robert O. 
Gibson Leadership Academy. 
Mrs. Jaeger has an accomplished his-
tory in serving Tier I, Title I schools 
and was recognized for her excellence 
in fostering a positive school culture 
and climate. During her time as prin-
cipal, Robert O. Gibson Leadership 
Academy received several accolades, 
including 
being 
named 
a 
Magnet 
School of Excellence for the year 2020 
and one of the first Purple Star 
Schools of Nevada for showing ‘‘a com-
mitment to understanding and address-
ing the unique needs of military-con-
nected students.’’ 
Through her career, Mrs. Jaeger put 
immense focus on the well-being of her 
students, including through her work 
with low-income families to identify 
kids in need of new shoes. Her work has 
yielded annual benefits for students 
and families in need through the Warm 
the Soles program. 
I ask my colleagues to join in me 
celebrating the amazing work of Jen-
nifer Jaeger. Her service to Nevada 
schools and the community at-large 
has been exemplary and worthy of rec-
ognition.∑

TRIBUTE TO JULIANA URTUBEY 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. Presi-
dent, 
I 
rise 
to 
recognize 
Juliana 
Urtubey, an outstanding Nevada educa-
tor and the 2021 National Teacher of 
the Year. 
Each year, the Council of Chief State 
School Officers honors one incredible 
educator as the National Teacher of 
the Year. This honor is the most pres-
tigious recognition for teachers in the 
country, and I am proud to honor Ms. 
Urtubey’s achievement today. Juliana 
Urtubey is the first Latina Teacher of 
the Year candidate from the State of 
Nevada, the first Latina national final-
ist since 1992, and the first Nevada 
Teacher of the Year awardee in the his-
tory of the program. In addition, Ms. 
Urtubey is only the third special edu-
cator to receive this amazing honor. 
Ms. Urtubey has been an educator for 
11 years and teaches at Kermit R. 
Booker, Sr. Innovative Elementary 
School in Las Vegas, NV. There, she 
serves as a special education co-teach-
er for the prekindergarten through 
fifth grade levels and as an instruc-
tional strategist in developing supports 
to meet students’ differing academic, 
social-emotional, and behavioral needs. 
Ms. Urtubey is also a national board 
certified teacher and holds a bachelor’s 
degree in bilingual elementary edu-
cation and a master’s degree in special 
bilingual education. Through her im-
pressive 
teaching 
career, 
Juliana 
Urtubey has also held the role of board 
of directors member and teaching fel-
low with the National Board for Profes-
sional Teaching Standards, senior pol-
icy fellow with Nevada Teach Plus, and 
teacher fellow with the organization 
Understood. 
In the classroom, Ms. Urtubey is also 
known as Ms. Earth for her work in 
unifying the community through mu-
rals and gardens in local schools. In 
this pursuit, Ms. Urtubey played a sig-
nificant role in fundraising for garden 
programs at two Las Vegas schools. 
I ask my colleagues to join in me 
celebrating 
this 
achievement.

TRIBUTE TO ROGER BEVERAGE 
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it’s my 
honor to recognize Roger Beverage, a 
distinguished 
Oklahoman 
and 
dear 
friend, who recently retired from his 
role as president and chief executive 
officer of the Oklahoma Bankers Asso-
ciation. While Roger is a native of 
Plattsmouth, NE, he has called Okla-
homa home for decades. He began his 
career as a trial lawyer, where he 
transitioned to a leading role with the 
Nebraska 
Bankers 
Association 
and 
later as the director of the Nebraska 
Department of Banking and Finance. 
For the past 33 years, Roger has led the 
Oklahoma Bankers Association. He de-
voted much of his life to advocating for 
the banking community across Okla-
homa and Washington, DC. There is no 
question his tireless work has left a 
lasting impact on our State. While it is 
sad to see him retire, I have great con-
fidence that his successor and son, 
Adrian, will carry forward the influen-
tial legacy of his father in the years 
ahead.∑

REMEMBERING VICE ADMIRAL 
JOHN CURRIER 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the memory of a de-
voted veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, 
VADM John Currier, who passed away 
in March of 2020. I would like to take 
the time today to reflect on his service, 
courage, and tenacity as the hangar at 
the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Tra-
verse City is dedicated in his honor. 
Born and raised in Westbrook, ME, 
Vice Admiral Currier began his career 
in service as a police officer. Further 
expanding his devotion to serve, Vice 
Admiral Currier commissioned from 
Officer Candidate School as a naval 
aviator in 1976. He was first assigned to 
U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, 
where a few years later, his skills and 
commitment to protect were tested. 
On a snowy late October evening in 
1980, the Coast Guard received a dis-
tress call from the TERRY T., a burn-
ing and sinking fishing vessel in 30 foot 
seas. Winds were gusting over 60 knots 
and visibility was cut to three-quarters 
of a mile from heavy rain, according to 
reports. Currier, unfaltering in his 
duty to be Semper Paratus, was able to 
maneuver his aircraft into position 
based only on voice commands by the 
hoist operator. He had rescued eight of 
the crew when two men were swept off 
the deck and were in the water. He was 
able to fly the aircraft into position in 
order to get the rescue basket beneath 
the 
drowning 
crew 
members 
and 
brought them on board. 
Vice Admiral Currier was awarded 
the Harmon International Aviation 
Trophy, but his accolades and awards 
for rescue missions do not stop there. 
The Alaska Air Command SAR Pilot of 
the Year Award, American Helicopter 
Society, Fredrick L. Feinberg Award, 
and the Naval Helicopter Association 
SAR Aircrew of the Year, all have been 
awarded to Vice Admiral Currier for 
various 
hazardous 
rescue 
missions 
throughout his career. 
During his career, Vice Admiral 
Currier stood the watch at six Coast 
Guard air stations, from Alaska to 
Florida. He was designated as an aero-
nautical engineer in 1982, and after a 
few years in Alaska, Vice Admiral 
Currier was assigned to Air Station 
Traverse City in 1985. 
Other assignments have included dep-
uty program manager for the Coast 
Guard and Navy HH-60H/J joint heli-
copter acquisition at the Naval Air 
Systems Command, and chief of SAR 
operations and directory of auxiliary 
for the Ninth Coast Guard District. 
Vice Admiral Currier then served as 
commanding officer of Air Stations De-
troit and then Miami, which was then 
the world’s busiest air-sea search and 
rescue unit. An alumnus of the Univer-
sity of Southern Maine, he held a mas-
ter’s in business administration from 
Embry-Riddle University. He was a 1996 
graduate of the U.S. Air Force Air War 
College and held a level III acquisition 
program manager certification. 
Subsequently, he was assigned as Pa-
cific area chief of operations, then area 
chief of staff, and was appointed com-
mander of the 13th District, which cov-
ers the Pacific Northwest. He assumed 
the duties of the Coast Guard’s chief of 
staff in 2009, later transitioning that 
position to the service’s first deputy 
Commandant for Mission Support. Vice 
Admiral Currier assumed duties as the 
28th Vice Commandant in May 2012, 
during which time he was awarded the 
title of Ancient Albatross of the Coast 
Guard, until his retirement in May of 
2014. 
Vice Admiral Currier was a devoted 
military man and was supported by an 
incredible spouse—his wife of 45 years, 
Mary Jane Currier. They were known 
for their hospitality and for throwing 
spectacular parties for fellow Coast 
Guard members, family, and friends. 
Mary Jane and John had two sons, Ben-
jamin and Andrew. John was a devoted 
father 
who 
spent 
countless 
hours 
coaching Little League and teaching 
his two sons woodworking and auto 
mechanics. In his retirement, Vice Ad-
miral Currier and Mary Jane enjoyed 
boating on Lake Michigan with their 
four grandchildren. 
Mr. President, I ask you and my fel-
low colleagues to join me in cele-
brating the life and service of Vice Ad-
miral John Currier. As we remember 
Vice Admiral Currier’s life, I have no 
doubt his surviving wife, children, and 
family have found comfort in the pre-
cious moments they shared and in the 
love he showed them. With the U.S. 
Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City 
hangar now dedicated in his memory, I 
hope those who had the honor of serv-
ing beside Vice Admiral Currier re-
member his legacy when they enter it 
and that future Coast Guardsman are 
inspired by his devoted and honorable 
career.∑

RECOGNIZING ABRACADABRA’S 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, the chal-
lenges of the COVID–19 pandemic have 
not been easy for small business own-
ers and their employees to overcome. 
Throughout the pandemic, many were 
forced to temporarily close their doors. 
Those that reopened had to innovate 
their business models to comply with 
local guidelines and public health man-
dates. As we turn the corner on the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I am proud to re-
launch Support Local Gems, a state-
wide initiative, on May 21 to encourage 
Idahoans to support local small busi-
nesses in their communities. This 
month, as a senior member and former 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I 
will honor six small businesses located 
throughout the State of Idaho. I am 
pleased to honor Abracadabra’s in Twin 
Falls as one of the Idaho Small Busi-
nesses of the Month for May 2021. 
The Twin Fall’s Abracadabra’s is a 
breakfast-style bistro owned by Josh 
and Jonathan Swain and Nikki Bourne. 
The brothers have made it their mis-
sion to bring childhood magic back to 
breakfast food for all ages. The res-
taurant is renowned for engaging its 
customers through unique specialty 
dishes and an outside-the-box atmos-
phere. Customers rave about the cre-
ative food designs and the interactive 
dining experience. Its popularity has 
led to the restaurant winning the 
Magic Valley Readers’ Choice Award 
for Best Breakfast in 2020. 
Amid the pandemic, Abracadabra’s 
was instrumental in providing essen-
tial items to the local community. 
Last spring, many local grocery stores 
experienced 
shortages 
of 
everyday 
items. The restaurant adapted its busi-
ness model to provide wholesale prod-
ucts like bacon, eggs, flour, and sani-
tizing products in bulk to the commu-
nity. Through the use of online order-
ing and curbside pickup processes, cus-
tomers 
remained 
safely 
socially 
distanced while retrieving basic gro-
cery items that they desperately need-
ed. Thanks to their innovative think-
ing, the owners addressed the changing 
needs of their community while keep-
ing their staff safe and employed. 
Congratulations to Abracadabra’s in 
Twin Falls on being selected as an 
Idaho Gem for the month of May. You 
serve as an example in your commu-
nity and are an outstanding example of 
what it means to be one of Idaho’s 
Local Gems.∑

S2778 
May 19, 2021 
Those that reopened had to innovate 
their business models to comply with 
local guidelines and public health man-
dates. As we turn the corner on the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I am proud to re-
launch Support Local Gems, a state-
wide initiative, on May 21 to encourage

nesses in their communities. This 
month, as a senior member and former 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I

throughout the State of Idaho. I am 
pleased to honor Great Harvest in 
Idaho Falls as one of the Idaho Small 
Businesses of the Month for May 2021. 
The Great Harvest Bread Company in 
Idaho Falls is owned and operated by 
Tiffani and John Van Orman. With two 
locations in Eastern Idaho, the bak-
eries are known for their vast selection 
of artisan breads, sweets, and treats. 
They pride themselves on using the 
freshest ingredients and making their 
products completely from scratch. 
Since its establishment over 20 years 
ago, the business has been actively in-
volved in the Idaho Falls community, 
donating money and baked goods to 
school fundraisers, church gatherings, 
and local charitable causes. While the 
pandemic has impacted their business, 
it has not deterred their charitable ef-
forts. During the March 2020 shutdown, 
Great Harvest kept all of their employ-
ees on the payroll and increased their 
production. The Van Ormans donated 
the extra food items to their local food 
pantry, YMCA, local school districts, 
hospitals, and emergency responders. 
They also placed Generosity Tables 
stocked with free baked goods outside 
of their bakeries and encouraged cus-
tomers to take them to people in need. 
Their spirit of generosity is what de-
fines Idaho’s small businesses, and 
Great Harvest Bread Company has 
stepped up for its community during 
these hard times. 
Congratulations to Great Harvest in 
Idaho Falls on being selected as an 
Idaho Gem for the month of May. You 
serve as an example in your commu-
nity and are an outstanding example of 
what it means to be one of Idaho’s

Happy Day is a four-generation fam-
ily business founded by Bruce and Joy 
Finch in 1969. After opening their first 
franchise restaurant in the Lewiston 
area, the couple went into business 
with Bruce’s father, Charles, and began 
to expand their venture. With 10 years 
of business under their belts, Bruce and 
Joy reorganized their budding com-
pany, officially naming it ‘‘Happy 
Day’’ to commemorate Joy’s delight 
that their company was flourishing. 
Today, the business comprises 13 fran-
chise and independent restaurants and 
a catering and events division. This has 
enabled the company to provide jobs 
for more than 450 employees in the In-
land Northwest. 
Above all else, Happy Day is known 
for its commitment to service. Each 
year, thousands of wildland firefighters 
battle wildfires throughout the West. 
In an effort to keep them fed, Happy 
Day provides hundreds of meals to 
these firefighters at their fire camps. 
In addition, the company has long sup-
ported 
veterans. 
Happy 
Day 
res-
taurants have served more than 100,000 
meals to local veterans through its 
monthly Tuesday Vets Meal initiative 
where veterans can eat for free. Their 
enduring 
dedication 
to 
community 
service has garnered them local and na-
tional awards, including being inducted 
into the Idaho Hall of Fame in 2016. 
Happy Day’s efforts to serve their com-
munity make them an exceptional ex-
ample of service-oriented small busi-
ness leadership. 
Congratulations to Happy Day on 
being selected as an Idaho Gem for the 
month of May. You serve as an exam-
ple in your community and are an out-
standing example of what it means to 
be one of Idaho’s Local Gems.∑

RECOGNIZING MOUNTAIN 
MADNESS SOAP 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, the chal-
lenges of the COVID–19 pandemic have 
not been easy for small business own-
ers and their employees to overcome. 
Throughout the pandemic, many were 
forced to temporarily close their doors. 
Those that reopened had to innovate 
their business models to comply with 
local guidelines and public health man-
dates. As we turn the corner on the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I am proud to re-
launch Support Local Gems, a state-
wide initiative, on May 21 to encourage 
Idahoans to support local small busi-
nesses in their communities. This 
month, as a senior member and former 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I 
will honor six small businesses located 
throughout the State of Idaho. I am 
pleased to honor Mountain Madness 
Soap in Coeur d’Alene as one of the 
Idaho Small Businesses of the Month 
for May 2021. 
Mountain Madness Soap is a spe-
cialty handmade soap and bath prod-
ucts company founded by Jennifer and 
Andy Morsell. The business began with 
Jennifer’s hobby of making organic 
soaps in her kitchen and giving them 
as gifts to friends and family. The en-
thusiastic reception she received in-
spired Jennifer and her husband to 
start their own business selling the 
soaps at local farmers markets and 
craft fairs. The pair eventually moved 
to Coeur d’Alene, where they opened 
their first shop. The business quickly 
found success as demand soared for 
their locally sourced soap and bath 
products. Finding themselves unable to 
keep pace with demand, the business 
expanded into a larger facility in 2016, 
enabling them to increase the size of 
their retail space and expand their pro-
duction and fulfillment facilities. 
To overcome the challenges and 
retrictions of the pandemic, Mountain 
Madness adapted its operations to con-
tinue serving the community safely. 
Jennifer and Andy kept the store open 
by implementing face mask require-
ments for employees, rigorous sanita-
tion 
of 
facilities, 
and 
by 
adding 
curbside pickup and at-home deliv-
eries. Jennifer and Andy made the safe-
ty of their customers and employees 
the top priority. They adapted quickly 
to new challenges and developed ways 
to bring their products to their cus-
tomers. And through that quick and in-
novative response, they managed to 
grow their business despite the hard-
ship. Mountain Madness continues to 
support its fellow Idaho small busi-
nesses by purchasing locally sourced 
product materials from other small 
businesses. 
Congratulations to Mountain Mad-
ness Soap on being selected as an Idaho 
Gem for the month of May. You serve 
as an example in your community and 
are an outstanding example of what it 
means to be one of Idaho’s Local 
Gems.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2779 
May 19, 2021 
The Pocatello Sandpiper was founded 
by Bob Angell in 1975 and is currently 
owned by Rod Russell. With two loca-
tions in Eastern Idaho, the restaurant 
is known for its cozy atmosphere and 
steak and seafood offerings. It has be-
come a staple of the local community, 
garnering awards for Best Restaurant, 
Best Steak and Seafood, Best Fine Din-
ing, and Best Place To Take A Date 
awards in the Idaho State Journal’s 
Readers’ Choice Awards. 
Rod and his wife, Kathleen, have 
served as leaders in the local commu-
nity during the pandemic. The res-
taurant avoided layoffs, raised wages, 
and provided special meals to employ-
ees and their families even though they 
operated at a loss. In addition to the 
measures taken by the restaurant, 
upon receiving their $1,200 stimulus 
check, the Russells began thinking of 
ways to give back to their community. 
As the brother of a truckdriver, Rod 
heard firsthand some of the challenges 
facing truckers amid supply chain 
shortages. To show thanks to an under-
appreciated group of essential workers, 
the Pocatello Sandpiper partnered with 
Idaho State Police and other small 
businesses to provide more than 600 
free meals to truckdrivers in acknowl-
edgment of their critical work. Rod’s 
commitment to service allowed this 
small business to prioritize the needs 
of both its employees and the commu-
nity. 
Congratulations to the Sandpiper in 
Pocatello on being selected as an Idaho 
Gem for the month of May. You serve 
as an example in your community and 
are an outstanding example of what it 
means to be one of Idaho’s Local 
Gems.∑

RECOGNIZING TLC FOR TOTS 
∑ Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, the chal-
lenges of the COVID–19 pandemic have 
not been easy for small business own-
ers and their employees to overcome. 
Throughout the pandemic, many were 
forced to temporarily close their doors. 
Those that reopened had to innovate 
their business models to comply with 
local guidelines and public health man-
dates. As we turn the corner on the 
COVID–19 pandemic, I am proud to re-
launch Support Local Gems, a state-
wide initiative, on May 21 to encourage 
Idahoans to support local small busi-
nesses in their communities. This 
month, as a senior member and former 
chairman of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I 
will honor six small businesses located 
throughout the State of Idaho. I am 
pleased to honor TLC for Tots as one of 
the Idaho Small Businesses of the 
Month for May 2021. 
TLC for Tots is a family-owned 
childcare and preschool learning center 
located in Nampa, ID. In 2006, owners 
Dave and Elizabeth Fetzer started the 
business out of their home, providing 
individualized attention to each of its 
students. The business quickly outgrew 
its original location, relocating in 2008 
to a larger facility where it remains 
today. The owners credit their success 
to their phenomenal staff who are con-
stantly training and reeducating them-
selves to provide high-quality care. Ad-
ditionally, TLC for Tots facilitates 
early intervention programs and spon-
sors family events to ensure the con-
tinued growth of their students. 
TLC for Tots has remained com-
mitted to combating the spread of 
COVID–19. At its facility, temperature 
checks 
are 
regularly 
administered, 
daily cleanings are conducted through-
out the facility, and staff were required 
to wear masks throughout the day dur-
ing the height of the pandemic. The 
business provides more than a dozen 
jobs to the Nampa community and has 
been dedicated to serving local families 
while adhering to COVID–19 guidelines. 
Congratulations to TLC for Tots on 
being selected as an Idaho Gem for the 
month of May. You serve as an exam-
ple in your community and are an out-
standing example of what it means to 
be one of Idaho’s Local Gems.∑

RECOGNIZING FARMERS FEEDING 
UTAH 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to commend the outstanding charitable 
efforts of the Farmers Feeding Utah 
campaign, a project of the Miracle of 
Agriculture Foundation and the Utah 
Farm Bureau Federation. As the pan-
demic brought new challenges to farm-
ers, ranchers, and families everywhere, 
volunteers 
and 
community 
leaders 
across the State joined together to 
help our neighbors in need. 
Last year, disruptions to our food se-
curity and supply chains led to un-
charted economic hardship for both 
producers and consumers. For many, 
this included putting food on the table. 
Nevertheless, Utahns were determined 
to chart new opportunities for creative 
and charitable giving. 
Recognizing an alarming increased 
demand in food pantries statewide, the 
Utah 
Farm 
Bureau 
Federation 
launched a campaign to deliver food to 
disadvantaged 
Utah 
families. 
To 
achieve this, the Farmers Feeding 
Utah program collects generous dona-
tions used to purchase commodities 
from Utah farmers facing pandemic-re-
lated market shortages and losses. 
These products are distributed to food 
pantries with the help of numerous 
community-based organizations, which 
in turn sustains our farms and ranches. 
To date, the Farmers Feeding Utah 
campaign has collected over 1.5 million 
pounds of food, worth over $3.2 million, 
from donations by individuals and or-
ganizations 
passionate 
about 
alle-
viating hunger. These extraordinary 
acts of kindness have provided nutri-
tional relief to more than 23,000 Utah 
families 
along 
the 
Wasatch 
front, 
northern Utah, the Navajo Nation, and 
across southern and rural Utah. 
The success of this initiative under-
scores Utah’s excellence in fielding so-
lutions to complex problems, to the 
benefit of individuals and families in 
need. The collaboration of diverse part-
ners across the agriculture industry, 
health sector, and religious and aca-
demic 
institutions 
highlights 
our 
State’s esteemed tradition of charity. 
In addition to the Utah Farm Bureau 
Federation, partners like Utah State 
University’s Hunger Solutions Insti-
tute and Create Better Health pro-
grams, the Utah Department of Agri-
culture & Food, the Farm Bureau Fi-
nancial Services, the Utah Petroleum 
Association, the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, and scores of gen-
erous Utah companies and individuals 
have provided invaluable support to 
this effort. 
There is more work to be done, which 
is why the Farmers Feeding Utah pro-
gram continues to organize food drives 
and deliver critical assistance in cities 
all over Utah. With every additional 
meal donated to a hungry family, our 
Utah 
family 
grows 
ever 
stronger. 
Thank you to all involved in this tre-
mendous public-private service initia-
tive, with special gratitude for the 
strong leadership of Ron ‘‘The Milk-
man’’ Gibson as Farm Bureau presi-
dent. Keep up the great work.∑

certain Filipino World War II veterans 
from the numerical limitations on im-
migrant visas, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Filipino Vet-
erans Family Reunification Act of 2021. 
This important legislation would expe-
dite the visa process for adult children 
of Filipino World War II veterans, so 
they can reunite with their relatives in 
the United States. Today, fewer than 
6,000 Filipino World War II veterans re-
main. Many of these veterans are now 
in their late 80s and 90s, and have been 
separated from their loved ones for far 
too long. 
During World War II, more than 
250,000 Filipino soldiers fought under 
the American flag to protect and de-
fend the United States in the Pacific

theater. These Filipino soldiers fought 
shoulder 
to 
shoulder 
with 
U.S. 
servicemembers, 
and 
approximately 
60,000 died in battle. The U.S. govern-
ment promised these veterans com-
pensation and benefits in exchange for 
their loyal service to our country. 
However, 
after 
the 
war, 
Congress 
passed the Rescission Act of 1946, deny-
ing Filipino veterans many of the bene-
fits conferred to other World War II 
veterans. 
Filipino World War II veterans were 
not awarded U.S. citizenship until 1990, 
more than 40 years after they risked 
their lives for our Nation. Although 
the Immigration Act of 1990 granted 
U.S. citizenship to approximately 26,000 
Filipino nationals who served during 
World War II, the law did not confer 
citizenship or residency to their chil-
dren. Therefore, the children of the Fil-
ipino veterans are required to apply for 
family-based green cards which are 
subject to an annual limitation as well 
as a country cap. Under the cap, only 
seven percent of recipients are per-
mitted to come from a single country. 
These limitations have created a large 
backlog of people trying to reunite 
with family from the Philippines and 
as a result, some Filipino applicants 
must wait nearly two decades before 
their petitions can be considered. 
In an attempt to partially resolve 
this issue, in 2016 under the Obama Ad-
ministration, U.S. Citizenship and Im-
migration Services (USCIS) established 
the Filipino World War II Veterans Pa-
role (FWVP) program to reunite vet-
erans and their surviving spouses with 
their adult children and siblings. Under 
FWVP, USCIS can grant parole on a 
discretionary, case-by-case basis, to a 
veteran’s family member so that they 
may come to the United States as they 
wait for their immigrant visa to be-
come available. This policy recognizes 
the extraordinary contributions and 
sacrifices of Filipino veterans while 
also allowing these elderly veterans to 
be cared for by family. Despite the 
value of this program, the Trump Ad-
ministration announced its intention 
to terminate FWVP and in December 
2020, published final steps to end this 
program in the Federal Register. I 
joined Rep. ED CASE in sending a bi-
cameral and bipartisan letter with col-
leagues to President Biden in Feb-
ruary, urging the new administration 
to rescind the termination efforts and 
renew FWVP. 
The threat to end FWVP persists to 
this day. The legislation that I am in-
troducing, the Filipino Veterans Fam-
ily Reunification Act of 2021, would re-
solve this issue permanently and fulfill 
our nation’s promise to honor the Fili-
pino World War II veterans’ service to 
our country. This bill would help to re-
unite these families by exempting the 
sons and daughters of Filipino World 
War II veterans from immigration lim-
itations in the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act. This change in law 
would benefit only a few thousand sur-
viving Filipino World War II veterans 
who desperately want to be reunited 
with their children in their last years. 
I call on my Senate colleagues to 
quickly pass this bill. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
WARNER, Mr. RUBIO, Mrs. SHA-
HEEN, Mr. CORNYN, Mr. BENNET, 
Mr. BLUNT, Mrs. GILLIBRAND, 
Mr. BURR, Mr. HEINRICH, Mr. 
SASSE, 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. 
COTTON, Mr. KING, and Mr. 
RISCH): 
S. 1714. A bill to amend the Central 
Intelligence Agency Act of 1949 to au-
thorize the provision of payment to 
personnel of the Central Intelligence 
Agency who incur qualifying injuries 
to the brain, to authorize the provision 
of payment to personnel of the Depart-
ment of State who incur similar inju-
ries, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to introduce the Helping Amer-
ican Victims Afflicted by Neurological 
Attacks Act, the HAVANA Act. Our 
bill would provide assistance to the 
employees of the intelligence commu-
nity and other Federal Agencies who 
have suffered from traumatic brain in-
juries at the hands of our foreign ad-
versaries. 
I am joined today by a bipartisan 
group of cosponsors, including Sen-
ators WARNER and RUBIO, the chairman 
and vice chair of the Senate Intel-
ligence Committee, and Senators SHA-
HEEN, CORNYN, BENNET, BURR, GILLI-
BRAND, BLUNT, HEINRICH, SASSE, FEIN-
STEIN, COTTON, KING, and RISCH. Most 
of those are members of the Intel-
ligence Committee, and they share my 
deep concern and my determination to 
get to the bottom of what has hap-
pened to these brave men and women 
who have been attacked. 
For many years, American personnel 
serving in Cuba, China, and elsewhere 
have experienced unexplained, serious 
medical 
harm, 
including, 
in 
some 
cases, permanent brain injuries. These 
conditions are believed to be connected 
to a mysterious direct energy weapon 
used by those who are our adversaries. 
As we investigate the source of pre-
vious attacks and seek to prevent fu-
ture ones, the bill that I am intro-
ducing today would provide additional 
financial assistance to Americans who 
were injured and who continue to expe-
rience 
debilitating 
symptoms. 
Too 
many of the victims have had to fight 
to get the medical care they need for 
their injuries. This is completely unac-
ceptable. 
Last year, the National Academies of 
Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
released a report on the more than 40 
American diplomats at the U.S. Em-
bassy in Havana, Cuba, and at least a 
dozen American diplomats at the U.S. 
Consulate in Guangzhou, China, who 
suffered symptoms ‘‘consistent with 
the effects of directed, pulsed radio-
frequency energy.’’ Just this month, 
the New York Times reported that the 
number of American personnel who 
have fallen ill under these mystifying 
circumstances is much higher, possibly 
more than 130 cases. Now, we are even 
hearing reports of cases occurring 
within the United States. 
The injuries that many of these vic-
tims have endured are significant and 
life-altering. These attacks have left 
Americans serving our country with 
damage that ranges in severity but can 
include reduced balance, eyesight, and 
hearing. Some have severe, permanent 
headaches. Others have brain injuries 
that have resulted in reduced cognitive 
function. Many of them can no longer 
perform their jobs and have been forced 
to medically retire. 
To make matters worse, some of the 
victims did not receive the financial 
and medical support they should have 
expected from their government when 
they first reported their injuries. This 
is an outrageous failure on the part of 
our government to care for those who 
serve. 
Our bill would give additional au-
thority to the CIA Director and to the 
Secretary of State to provide financial 
support to these Americans who experi-
ence traumatic brain injuries from at-
tacks that occur while serving our 
country. Due to limitations in the cur-
rent law, several victims suffering 
from cognitive impairment are not re-
ceiving all of the medical care and 
other assistance they need to cope with 
the impacts of their injuries. The au-
thorities provided in the HAVANA Act 
will help to rectify this problem. 
I have spoken personally with some 
of the victims of these heinous attacks. 
This is a group who unfortunately is 
growing in number. To those victims, I 
want to pledge to them today that, 
along with the cosponsors of our bill, I 
am totally committed to making sure 
that our government finds out who is 
responsible for these devastating at-
tacks, and I further pledge to the vic-
tims that you will receive the financial 
support and medical care that you de-
serve. 
I have spoken several times to CIA 
Director Burns about these attacks, 
and I am heartened by his commitment 
and his attitude. He has made commit-
ments to the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee, as has the Director of National 
Intelligence, to care for these victims 
and to get to the bottom of these at-
tacks. 
We need a whole-of-government ap-
proach to identify the heartless adver-
sary who is deliberately targeting 
American personnel. 
The public servants who work in our 
Embassies and Consulates and in other 
locations overseas make many personal 
sacrifices to represent America’s inter-
ests. They deserve our strong support 
when they are harmed in the line of 
duty, just as we care for soldiers who 
are injured on the battlefield. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join 
us in supporting this vital legislation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2785 
May 19, 2021 
S. 1718. A bill to amend the Rosie the 
Riveter/World War II Home Front Na-
tional Historical Park Establishment 
Act of 200 to provide for additional 
areas to be added to the park, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the ‘‘Rosie the Riveter 
National Historic Site Expansion Act.’’ 
The Rosie the Riveter WWII Home 
Front National Historical Park honors 
the history of Richmond, California as 
the home of World War II shipyards 
and the women and men who supported 
the war effort domestically. 
Richmond, California was chosen as 
the site for this National Historical 
Park because it has so many surviving 
sites and structures from the World 
War II era that help tell the diverse 
stories of the home front. According to 
the National Park Service, ‘‘these sto-
ries include the mobilization of Amer-
ica’s industry and the changes in pro-
duction techniques; the struggle for 
women’s and minority rights; the labor 
movement; the growth of pre-paid med-
ical care; advances in early childhood 
education and day care; recycling and 
rationing; major shifts in population; 
and changes in arts and culture.’’ 
This 
legislation 
would 
add 
the 
Nystrom Elementary School to the ex-
isting National Historical Park. 
During World War II, the Nystrom 
Elementary school was built to teach 
the children of shipyard workers. The 
school was part of a planned develop-
ment including the Maritime Child De-
velopment center, which has already 
been preserved as part of the park, and 
the Nystrom housing area, which has 
been scheduled for future preservation 
and redevelopment by the city of Rich-
mond. 
The bill would also give the National 
Park Service the authority to add addi-
tional sites to the park through coop-
erative agreements and to acquire ad-
ditional sites for inclusion in the park. 
Having 
the 
Nystrom 
Elementary 
school identified as a site of the park 
will help the National Historical Park 
better preserve, interpret, and share 
that history with visitors. To under-
stand the social changes that occurred 
during World War II, it is important to 
have sites that represent those changes 
as tangible evidence. 
The City of Richmond and the West 
Contra Costa Unified School District 
support adding the school to the site. I 
thank my colleague, Representative 
MARK
DESAULNIER, for championing 
this effort in the House. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
passage of the ‘‘Rosie the Riveter Na-
tional Historic Site Expansion Act’’ as 
quickly as possible. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

S. RES. 226 
Whereas the United States designated 
Hamas as a terrorist organization on October 
8, 1997; 
Whereas Hamas, a terrorist organization, 
seized power of Gaza in 2007; 
Whereas Hamas continues to control Gaza 
and to work alongside other terror groups to 
attack Israeli civilians, while refusing to 
recognize Israel or to attempt to negotiate 
peace; 
Whereas in May of 2021, Hamas and its Pal-
estinian terrorist allies in Gaza, which are 
funded by Iran, have launched the largest 
barrage of rockets into Israel in decades, tar-
geting Israeli civilians and cities, including 
Jerusalem, Israel’s capital; 
Whereas the State of Israel is a key ally 
and a strategic partner of the United States; 
Whereas, since Israel’s founding in 1948, 
Congress has repeatedly expressed our Na-
tion’s unwavering commitment to the secu-
rity of Israel; and 
Whereas cooperation between Israel and 
the United States is of great importance: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) opposes the escalating and indiscrimi-
nate rocket attacks by Hamas against Israel; 
(2) mourns the loss of innocent life 
caused by Hamas’ rocket attacks; 
(3) urges continued and steadfast support 
for Israel, because we have no greater ally in 
our efforts to preserve peace and secure our 
interests in the Middle East; 
(4) affirms its unwavering commitment 
to our ally, Israel, and its right to defend 
itself and its civilians against terror by 
whatever means necessary to stop the mur-
der of Israeli citizens and foreign nationals 
residing in Israel; 
(5) supports and stands with Israel as it 
defends its people from these reprehensible 
terrorist attacks; and 
(6) reaffirms its strong support for 
Israel’s right to peace and security.

At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. POINT OF ORDER TO ENSURE UNITED 
STATES ADEQUATELY FUNDS NA-
TIONAL DEFENSE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Senate makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Relative to the February 2021 Congres-
sional 
Budget 
Office 
spending 
baseline, 
President Joseph R. Biden has proposed more 
than $6,000,000,000,000 in nondefense spending 
outside the annual appropriations process. 
(2) President Biden’s fiscal year 2022 budget 
request proposes to increase spending in the 
nondefense discretionary category by almost 
20 percent while cutting the United States 
defense budget in real terms. 
(3) 
This 
Act 
contains 
more 
than 
$100,000,000,000 of authorizations of appro-
priations without a single additional dollar 
authorized to be appropriated for the Depart-
ment of Defense. 
(4) The United States Armed Forces has 
lost $400,000,000,000 relative to inflation since 
2011. 
(5) The People’s Liberation Army has expe-
rienced real budget growth for more than 
two decades, including 6.8 percent growth in 
2021. 
(6) A July 22, 2019, statement by Speaker of 
the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi 
and Senator Chuck Schumer stated that 
‘‘Democrats have always insisted on parity 
in increases between defense and non-de-
fense’’. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that Congress should ade-
quately fund national defense with a whole- 
of-government investment plan for strategic 
competition with the People’s Republic of 
China, including by adhering to the principle 
of parity between increases for defense and 
nondefense spending, which would result in 
significant real growth for the defense budg-
et. 
(c) POINT OF ORDER FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022.— 
It shall not be in order in the Senate to con-
sider— 
(1) a concurrent resolution on the budget,

the budget, that determines and declares as 
the appropriate level of new discretionary 
budget authority for major functional cat-
egory 050 (National Defense) for fiscal year 
2022 an amount that is less than the total 
amount of the appropriate level of new dis-
cretionary budget authority determined and 
declared for all major functional categories 
other than major functional category 050 for 
fiscal year 2022; 
(2) a bill or joint resolution reported pursu-
ant to section 310 of the Congressional Budg-
et Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 641), or an amendment 
to, conference report on, amendment be-
tween the Houses in relation to, or motion 
on such a bill or joint resolution, that appro-
priates amounts for 1 or more major func-
tional categories other than major func-
tional category 050 for fiscal year 2022 and 
does not appropriate amounts for major 
functional category 050 for fiscal year 2022 in 
an amount that is not less than the amount 
appropriated under that measure for all 
major 
functional 
categories 
other 
than 
major functional category 050 for fiscal year 
2022; or 
(3) a bill or joint resolution making appro-
priations for fiscal year 2022, or an amend-
ment to, conference report on, amendment 
between the Houses in relation to, or motion 
on such a bill or joint resolution, that would 
cause the total amount of appropriations for 
the revised nonsecurity category for fiscal 
year 2022 to exceed the total amount of ap-
propriations for the revised security cat-
egory for fiscal year 2022. 
(d) WAIVER
AND APPEAL.—Subsection (c) 
may be waived or suspended in the Senate 
only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of 
the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An af-
firmative vote of three-fifths of the Members

SCHUMER to the bill S. 1260, to establish

SEC. 3236. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON MOD-
ERNIZATION OF NUCLEAR TRIAD. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the modernization of land-based inter-
continental ballistic missiles, ballistic mis-
sile submarines, and nuclear-capable heavy 
bomber aircraft is essential to the success of 
any arms control efforts with the People’s 
Republic of China; 
(2) the bipartisan consensus on the mod-
ernization of the nuclear triad was essential 
to the ratification of the Treaty between the 
United States of America and the Russian 
Federation on Measures for the Further Re-
duction and Limitation of Strategic Offen-
sive Arms, signed April 8, 2010, and entered 
into force February 5, 2011 (commonly known 
as the ‘‘New START Treaty’’); 
(3) continued support for modernization of 
the triad will be a necessary consideration 
during ratification of any future arms con-
trol treaty with the People’s Republic of 
China; and 
(4) the modernization of the United States 
nuclear triad is a critical priority as the 
Russian Federation and the People’s Repub-
lic of China continue to advance and mod-
ernize their nuclear forces. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is policy of 
the United States— 
(1) to advance United States strategic de-
fensive capabilities both quantitatively and 
qualitatively; 
(2) to ensure the safety, reliability, and 
performance of United States nuclear forces; 
and 
(3) to fully modernize the United States 
nuclear triad to ensure a credible deterrent. 
SA 1526. Mr. BARRASSO submitted 
an amendment intended to be proposed 
to amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr. 
SCHUMER to the bill S. 1260, to establish 
a new Directorate for Technology and 
Innovation in the National Science 
Foundation, to establish a regional 
technology hub program, to require a 
strategy and report on economic secu-
rity, 
science, 
research, 
innovation, 
manufacturing, and job creation, to es-
tablish a critical supply chain resil-
iency program, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
Strike section 3250 and insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 3250. ADDRESSING CHINA’S SOVEREIGN 
LENDING 
PRACTICES 
IN 
LATIN 
AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Since 2005, the Government of China has 
expanded sovereign lending to governments 
in Latin America and the Caribbean with 
loans that are repaid or collateralized with 
natural resources or commodities. 
(2) Several countries in Latin America and 
the Caribbean have received a significant 
amount of sovereign lending from the Gov-
ernment of China and are now facing chal-
lenges in repaying those loans. 
(3) In 2009, the People’s Republic of China 
became a member of the Inter-American De-
velopment Bank. 
(4) Since it was established in 1959, the 
Inter-American Development Bank has com-
pleted a total of nine capital increases. 
(5) The ninth capital increase occurred in 
March 2010, resulting in an increase of 
$70,000,000,000 of total capital, the largest 
capital increase in the Bank’s history. 
(6) The United States Congress has never 
authorized and appropriated a capital in-
crease for the Inter-American Development 
Bank before the formal completion of the re-
view of the capital needs of the Bank and ne-
gotiations on the capital increase. 
(7) In March 2021, the Board of Governors of 
the Inter-American Development Bank ap-
proved a resolution authorizing the analyt-
ical work required to consider a potential 
capital increase. 
(8) At the meeting, President Claver- 
Carone outlined how the Inter-American De-
velopment Bank Group in 2020 reached his-
toric financing levels of nearly $24,000,000,000 
for governments and firms in the region in 
response to the COVID–19 pandemic. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the Government of China’s predatory 
economic practices and sovereign lending 
practices in Latin America and the Carib-
bean negatively influence United States na-
tional interests in the Western Hemisphere; 
(2) the Inter-American Development Bank, 
the premier multilateral development bank 
dedicated to the Western Hemisphere, should 
play a significant role supporting the coun-
tries of Latin America and the Caribbean in 
achieving sustainable and serviceable debt 
structures; and 
(3) the United States should work with the 
Inter-American 
Development 
Bank 
to 
strengthen the Bank’s ability to help the 
countries of Latin America and the Carib-
bean achieve lasting economic development 
and debt restructuring. 
(c) ADDRESSING CHINA’S SOVEREIGN LEND-
ING IN THE AMERICAS.—The Secretary of the 
Treasury and the United States Executive 
Director to the Inter-American Development 
Bank shall use the voice, vote, and influence 
of the United States— 
(1) to advance efforts by the Bank to help 
countries restructure debt resulting from 
sovereign lending by the Government of 
China in order to achieve sustainable and 
serviceable debt structures; and 
(2) to establish appropriate safeguards and 
transparency and conditionality measures to 
protect debt-vulnerable member countries of 
the Inter-American Development Bank that 
borrow from the Bank for the purposes of re-
structuring Chinese bilateral debt held by 
such countries and preventing such countries 
from incurring subsequent Chinese bilateral 
debt. 
(d) BRIEFINGS.— 
(1) IMPLEMENTATION.—Not later than 90 
days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, and every 90 days thereafter, the Presi-
dent shall provide to the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate and the Com-
mittee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives a briefing detailing efforts 
to carry out subsection (c). 
(2) PROGRESS
IN
ACHIEVING
SUSTAINABLE 
AND
SERVICEABLE

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2799 
May 19, 2021 
(1) According to the Integrated Country 
Strategy for the United States Mission to 
China, released on August 29, 2018— 
(A) ‘‘Chinese law enforcement and security 
services employ extra-judicial means against 
U.S. citizens without regard to international 
norms’’; and 
(B) exit bans ‘‘are sometimes used to pre-
vent U.S. citizens who are not themselves 
suspected of a crime from leaving China as a 
means to pressure their relatives or associ-
ates who are wanted by Chinese law enforce-
ment in the United States’’. 
(2) The Government of China has imposed 
exit bans on United States citizens in the 
context of criminal charges and private com-
mercial disputes. 
(3) Imposing exit bans on foreign nationals 
is authorized by Article 28 of the Exit and 
Entry Administration Law of the People’s 
Republic of China, which— 
(A) lists the circumstances under which 
‘‘foreigners shall not be allowed to exit 
China’’, including ‘‘other circumstances in 
which exit shall not be allowed in accordance 
with laws or administrative regulations’’; 
and 
(B) assigns responsibility for administering 
exit/entry matters to the Ministry of Public 
Security and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
with public security organs responsible for 
administering ‘‘the stay and residence of for-
eigners. 
(4) Such exit bans against United States 
citizens may violate Article 35 of the Con-
sular Convention Between the United States 
of America and the People’s Republic of 
China, done at Washington September 17, 
1980, which states that— 
(A) if a United States national is ‘‘placed 
under any form of detention’’, the Govern-
ment of China shall notify the United States 
consulate within 4 days; and 
(B) a United States consular officer is enti-
tled to ‘‘be informed of the reasons for which 
said national has been arrested or detained 
in any manner.’’ 
(5) Such exit bans may also violate Article 
36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Re-
lations, done at Vienna April 24, 1963, and in 
effect in China as of August 1, 1979, which re-
quires the Government of China to ‘‘without 
delay, inform the consular post of the send-
ing State if, within its consular district, a 
national of that State. . .is detained in any 
other manner.’’. 
(6) Many United States citizens are not 
aware of a ban on their exit until they at-
tempt to leave China and once they are made 
aware of the ban, Chinese authorities provide 
very little information to the United States 
citizen, or to United States consular officials 
regarding— 
(A) the nature of the ban; 
(B) which Chinese government entity is re-
sponsible for the ban; and 
(C) what procedures must be followed to re-
solve the dispute related to the ban. 
(7) The apparent extra-judicial application 
of exit bans to United States citizens pre-
sents a serious human rights concern that 
violates due process rights to which United 
States citizens are entitled under inter-
national law. 
(c) INELIGIBILITY
OF CERTAIN ALIENS
FOR 
VISAS.—If the Secretary of State determines 
that an official of the Government of China 
has been substantially involved in the for-
mulation or execution of a policy that pro-
hibits certain United States citizens from 
leaving China in an attempt to convince a 
relative of such citizens to submit himself or 
herself into the custody of the Government 
of China for prosecution, to compel United 
States citizens to participate in Chinese gov-
ernment investigations, or to aid the Gov-
ernment of China in resolving civil disputes 
in favor of Chinese parties— 
(1) such official may not be issued a visa to 
enter the United States or be admitted to 
the United States; and 
(2) any visa or other documentation to 
enter or to be present in the United States 
that was previously issued to such official 
shall be revoked by the Secretary of State, 
in accordance with section 221(i) of the Im-
migration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 
1201(i)). 
(d) TERMINATION OF VISA INELIGIBILITY.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary of State 
may terminate visa ineligibility under sub-
section (c) with respect to an individual if 
the Secretary of State determines that— 
(A) credible information exists that the in-
dividual did not engage in the activity for 
which visa ineligibility was imposed; 
(B) the individual has been prosecuted ap-
propriately for the activity for which visa in-
eligibility was imposed; 
(C) the individual has— 
(i) credibly demonstrated a significant 
change in behavior; 
(ii) been subject to an appropriate con-
sequence for the activity for which visa in-
eligibility was imposed; and 
(iii) credibly committed to not engage in 
an activity described in subsection (c) in the 
future; or 
(D) the termination of visa ineligibility is 
in the national security interests of the 
United States. 
(2) NOTIFICATION.—Not later than 15 days 
before the date on which visa ineligibility is 
terminated under paragraph (1) with respect 
to an individual, the Secretary of State shall 
submit a report to the Committee on For-
eign Relations of the Senate, the Committee 
on the Judiciary of the Senate, the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs of the House of 
Representatives, and the Committee on the 
Judiciary of the House of Representatives 
that describes the justification for the termi-
nation. 
(e) ANNUAL REPORT TO CONGRESS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 1 year after 
the date of the enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter for the following 5 years, 
the Secretary of State shall submit a report 
to the congressional committees listed in 
subsection (d)(2) that identifies— 
(A) to the extent practicable, all of the 
Chinese officials who were substantially in-
volved in the formulation or execution of a 
policy that prohibits certain United States 
citizens from leaving China in an attempt— 
(i) to convince a relative of such citizens to 
submit himself or herself into the custody of 
the Government of China for prosecution; 
(ii) to compel United States citizens to 
participate in Chinese government investiga-
tions; or 
(iii) to aid the Government of China in re-
solving civil disputes in favor of Chinese par-
ties; 
(B) the individuals who have had visas de-
nied or revoked pursuant to subsection (c) 
during the preceding year, including the 
dates on which such denials or revocations 
were imposed or terminated, as applicable; 
(C) the number of United States citizens 
who the Government of China has prohibited 
from leaving China for any of the reasons de-
scribed in subsection (c); and 
(D) for each of the United States citizens 
referred to in subparagraph (C), the period 
during which they have been forced to re-
main in China. 
(2) FORM.—The report required under para-
graph (1) shall be submitted in unclassified 
form, but may include a classified annex. 
(3) EXCLUSION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE 
INFORMATION.—The Secretary of State may 
not include any personally identifying infor-
mation of any United States citizen in any of 
the reports submitted to Congress under 
paragraph (1). 
(4) PRIVACY
ACT.—Any information ob-
tained by the Secretary of State to complete 
the report under this subsection shall be sub-
ject to section 552a of title 5, United States 
Code (commonly known as the ‘‘Privacy 
Act’’). 
(f) WAIVER FOR NATIONAL INTEREST.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary of State 
may waive the application of subsection (c) 
in the case of an alien if the Secretary deter-
mines that such waiver— 
(A) is necessary to permit the United 
States to comply with the Agreement Re-
garding the Headquarters of the United Na-
tions, signed at Lake Success June 26, 1947, 
and entered into force November 21, 1947 
(TIAS 1676), or any other applicable inter-
national obligation of the United States; or 
(B) is in the national interest of the United 
States. 
(2) NOTIFICATION.—Upon granting a waiver 
under paragraph (1), the Secretary of State 
shall submit a report to the congressional 
committees listed in subsection (d)(2) that— 
(A) details the evidence and justification 
for the necessity of such waiver; and 
(B) if such waiver is granted pursuant to 
paragraph (1)(B), explains how such waiver 
relates to the national interest of the United 
States.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The People’s Republic of China has not 
entered into a treaty or agreement with the 
United States or any other party that places 
binding limits on its shorter-range, inter-
mediate-, or strategic-range ballistic mis-
siles, verified by national technical means 
and by on-site inspections, as the United 
States and the Russian Federation have done 
through the Intermediate-Range Nuclear 
Forces (INF) Treaty, the START I and 
START II Treaties, and the New START 
Treaty, each of which took multiple years to 
successfully negotiate. 
(2) The People’s Republic of China pos-
sesses significantly fewer intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, submarine launched bal-
listic missiles, and heavy bombers than the 
Russian Federation or the United States, 
and according to the Defense Intelligence 
Agency, the People’s Republic of China’s 
warhead stockpile is in the ‘‘the low couple 
of hundreds’’, a fraction of the size of the ar-
senals of the Russian Federation and the 
United States. 
(3) The People’s Republic of China has re-
peatedly declined invitations by the United 
States to enter into trilateral negotiations 
for an arms control treaty or other agree-
ment regarding its nuclear arsenal.

days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Secretary of State, in consultation

Secretary of Health and Human Services and 
the Administrator of the United States 
Agency 
for 
International 
Development, 
should— 
(1) immediately engage in multilateral and 
bilateral negotiations to provide surplus 
COVID–19 vaccines held by the United States 
to countries in need of such vaccines with 
the best opportunity for impact; 
(2) evaluate the perception of people 
throughout the world regarding— 
(A) the efforts made by the United States 
to supply COVID–19 vaccines to countries in 
need of such vaccines; and 
(B) the contributions made by other coun-
tries to supply COVID–19 vaccines to coun-
tries in need of such vaccines; and 
(3) integrate public diplomacy with the 
technical response to the worldwide COVID– 
19 vaccine shortage to the fullest extent 
practicable.

strategy and report on economic secu-
rity, 
science, 
research, 
innovation, 
manufacturing, and job creation, to es-
tablish a critical supply chain resil-
iency program, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
At the end of division C of the amendment, 
add the following: 
TITLE VI—TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION 
ACCOUNTABILITY AND PREVENTION 
SECTION 3601. SHORT TITLE. 
This 
title 
may 
be 
cited 
as 
the 
‘‘Transnational Repression Accountability 
and Prevention Act of 2021’’ or as the ‘‘TRAP 
Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 3602. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The International Criminal Police Or-
ganization (INTERPOL) works to prevent 
and fight crime through enhanced coopera-
tion and innovation on police and security 
matters, including kleptocracy, counterter-
rorism, cybercrime, counternarcotics, and 
transnational organized crime. 
(2) United States membership and partici-
pation in INTERPOL advances the national 
security and law enforcement interests of 
the United States related to combating 
kleptocracy, 
terrorism, 
cybercrime, 
nar-
cotics, and transnational organized crime. 
(3) Article 2 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that the organization aims ‘‘[to] en-
sure and promote the widest possible mutual 
assistance between all criminal police au-
thorities . . . in the spirit of the ‘Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights’ ’’. 
(4) Article 3 of INTERPOL’s Constitution 
states that ‘‘[i]t is strictly forbidden for the 
Organization to undertake any intervention 
or activities of a political, military, reli-
gious or racial character’’. 
(5) These principles provide INTERPOL 
with a foundation based on respect for 
human rights and avoidance of politically 
motivated actions by the organization and 
its members. 
(6) Some INTERPOL member countries 
have used INTERPOL’s databases and proc-
esses, including Notice and Diffusion mecha-
nisms and the Stolen and Lost Travel Docu-
ment Database, for activities of a political 
or other unlawful character and in violation 
of international human rights standards, in-
cluding making requests to INTERPOL for 
interventions related to purported charges of 
ordinary law crimes that are fabricated for 
political or other unlawful motives. 
(7) According to the Justice Manual of the 
United States Department of Justice, ‘‘[i]n 
the United States, national law prohibits the 
arrest of the subject of a Red Notice issued 
by another INTERPOL member country, 
based upon the notice alone’’ and requires 
the existence of a valid extradition treaty 
between the requesting country and the 
United States, a valid request for provisional 
arrest of the subject individual, and an ar-
rest warrant issued by a United States Dis-
trict Court based on a complaint filed by the 
United States Attorney’s Office of the sub-
ject jurisdiction. 
SEC. 3603. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States: 
(1) To use the voice, vote, and influence of 
the United States, as appropriate, within 
INTERPOL’s General Assembly and Execu-
tive Committee to promote the following ob-
jectives aimed at improving the trans-
parency of INTERPOL and ensuring its oper-
ation consistent with its Constitution, par-
ticularly articles 2 and 3, and Rules on the 
Processing of Data: 
(A) Support INTERPOL’s reforms enhanc-
ing the screening process for Notices, Diffu-
sions, and other INTERPOL communications 
to ensure they comply with INTERPOL’s 
Constitution and Rules on the Processing of 
Data (RPD). 
(B) Support and strengthen INTERPOL’s 
coordination with the Commission for Con-
trol of INTERPOL’s Files (CCF) in cases in 
which INTERPOL or the CCF has determined 
that a member country issued a Notice, Dif-
fusion, or other INTERPOL communication 
against an individual in violation of articles 
2 or 3 of the INTERPOL Constitution, or the 
RPD, to prohibit such member country from 
seeking the publication or issuance of any 
subsequent Notices, Diffusions, or other 
INTERPOL communication against the same 
individual based on the same set of claims or 
facts. 
(C) Support candidates for positions within 
INTERPOL’s structures, including the Presi-
dency, Executive Committee, General Secre-
tariat, and CCF who have demonstrated ex-
perience relating to and respect for the rule 
of law. 
(D) Seek to require INTERPOL in its an-
nual report to provide a detailed account of 
the following information, disaggregated by 
member country or entity: 
(i) 
The 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it received. 
(ii) 
The 
number 
of 
Notice 
requests, 
disaggregated by color, that it rejected. 
(iii) The category of violation identified in 
each instance of a rejected Notice. 
(iv) The number of Diffusions that it can-
celled without reference to decisions by the 
CCF. 
(v) The sources of all INTERPOL income 
during the reporting period. 
(E) Support greater transparency by the 
CCF in its annual report by providing a de-
tailed account of the following information, 
disaggregated by country: 
(i) The number of admissible requests for 
correction or deletion of data received by the 
CCF regarding issued Notices, Diffusions, 
and other INTERPOL communications. 
(ii) The category of violation alleged in 
each such complaint. 
(2) Put in place procedures, as appropriate, 
for sharing with relevant departments and 
agencies credible information of likely at-
tempts 
by 
member 
countries 
to 
abuse 
INTERPOL communications for politically 
motivated or other unlawful purposes so 
that, as appropriate, action can be taken in 
accordance with their respective institu-
tional mandates.

partments or agencies took in response to

SEC. 71002. SEAFOOD IMPORT MONITORING PRO-
GRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) It remains the policy of the United 
States to take action to curtail the global 
trade in seafood and seafood products derived 
from illegal, unreported, or unregulated fish-
ing, including the links of such trade to 
forced labor and transnational organized il-
legal activity. 
(2) The Federal Government and State au-
thorities have implemented measures to pre-
vent United States persons from engaging in 
illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing, 
using forced labor in the production of sea-
food, and fraudulently concealing relevant 
information concerning the production of 
seafood, including— 
(A) enhanced enforcement activities by the 
Coast Guard and effective enforcement by 
Federal and State authorities of criminal 
and civil penalties; 
(B) actions taken by the National Marine 
Fisheries Service of the National Oceanic 
and Atmospheric Administration to enhance 
traceability of seafood produced in the 
United States, including actions taken pur-
suant to division B of the Consolidated Ap-
propriations Act, 2018 (Public Law 115–141; 
132 Stat. 400) and the Magnuson-Stevens 
Fishery Conservation and Management Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq.); and 
(C) inspections undertaken by the Food 
and Drug Administration and the Depart-
ment of Agriculture of aquaculture facilities 
in the United States. 
(3) Seafood that is the result of illegal, un-
reported, or unregulated fishing, forced 
labor, or human trafficking may still enter 
United States commerce as those conditions 
remain a severe problem in the global fish-
eries sector, as reflected in reports and stud-
ies prepared by the United States Inter-
national Trade Commission (USITC), the 
International Labour Organization (ILO), 
and the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (FAO). 
(4) According to a study and model by the 
USITC published in March 2021, nearly 11 
percent of total United States seafood im-
ports and more than 13 percent of United 
States imports caught at sea in 2019 were de-
rived from illegal, unreported, or unregu-
lated fishing. 
(5) As recognized by the FAO, traceability 
of fish and fishery products is critical for 
verifying the integrity of a supply chain and 
ensures the quality and safety of the fishery 
products of the supply chain, the legality of 
such products, and that such products origi-
nate from fisheries that are sustainably 
managed. 
(6) Effective implementation of the Agree-
ment on Port State Measures to Prevent, 
Deter, and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported, 
and Unregulated Fishing set forth by the 
Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations, done at Rome, Italy Novem-
ber 22, 2009, and entered into force June 5, 
2016, including the provisions of the agree-
ment relating to cooperation, will be en-
hanced by ensuring effective traceability of 
seafood imported into the United States.

tion under section 301(b), the Trade Rep-

and maintain a process for exclusion re-
quests from duties under section 301(b) un-
less the Trade Representative determines 
and certifies to the appropriate congres-

move unreasonable or discriminatory prac-
tices burdening commerce in the United 
States; or 
‘‘(B) is impractical due to the low value of 
the duties imposed.

tification, the Trade Representative shall 
brief the appropriate congressional commit-

‘‘(2) CRITERIA DESCRIBED.—The criteria de-
scribed in this paragraph for exclusion of ar-
ticles from duties under section 301(b) in-
clude the following:

clusion would result in severe economic 
harm to the requester. 
‘‘(B) Whether the article or a reasonable 
substitute is not commercially available to 
the requester. 
‘‘(C) Whether the imposition of the duty 
with respect to the article would unreason-
ably increase consumer prices for day-to-day 
items consumed by low- or middle-income 
families in the United States. 
‘‘(D) Whether the imposition of the duty 
would have an unreasonable impact on man-
ufacturing output of the United States. 
‘‘(E) Whether the imposition of the duty 
would have an unreasonable impact on the 
ability of an entity to fulfill contracts or to 
build critical infrastructure. 
‘‘(F) Whether the failure to grant the ex-
clusion is likely to result in a particular en-
tity or entities having the ability to abuse a 
dominant market position.

section shall not apply to duties imposed

resolution process under the World Trade Or-
ganization.

imposing any duty under section 301(b), the 
Trade Representative, in consultation with 
such other Federal agencies as the Trade 
Representative considers appropriate, shall 
publish a notice in the Federal Register re-
garding the criteria that the Trade Rep-
resentative will apply and the evidence it 
will evaluate in determining whether a re-
quest for exclusion from such duty satisfies 
the requirements of the exclusion process 
under subsection (b)(1). 
‘‘(f) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
‘‘(1) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘appropriate congressional 
committees’ means—

ment.

that article from the imposition of such a

sult in severe economic harm to the re-
quester;

mines that granting the exclusion would im-
pair the ability of the United States to main-
tain effective pressure to remove an unrea-
sonable or discriminatory practice burdening 
United States commerce, the Trade Rep-
resentative shall exclude that article from 
the imposition of such a duty if the Trade 
Representative determines following a re-
quest from a United States entity or an asso-
ciation of those entities that— 
(i) the article or a reasonable substitute is

sumed by low- or middle-income families in

an unreasonable impact on manufacturing 
output of the United States;

ties having the ability to abuse a dominant

SEC. 73006. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LEADER-
SHIP AT WORLD TRADE ORGANIZA-
TION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The United States had led the forma-
tion, as well as reform, of rules governing 
the multilateral trading system since World 
War II. 
(2) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization (in this sec-
tion referred to as the ‘‘WTO’’) and a key ar-
chitect of the organization. 
(3) The United States secured important 
commitments in the WTO to facilitate trade 
in goods and services, to prevent the applica-
tion of non-scientific restrictions on United 
States agriculture, and to protect United 
States intellectual property. 
(4) The United States uses the rules of the 
WTO to benefit workers, farmers, fishers, 
and businesses in the United States by facili-
tating access to the 90 percent of the world’s 
consumers who live outside the borders of 
the United States. 
(5) The fundamental purpose of the WTO is 
to create space for members to negotiate 
with each other, and the WTO reserves to 
those members exclusively the right to nego-
tiate and adopt rules that reduce and elimi-
nate trade barriers and discriminatory treat-
ment. 
(6) The prompt settlement of disputes in 
which a member of the WTO considers that 
its rights are being impaired by the actions 
of another member is essential to the func-
tioning of the WTO and the maintenance of 
a proper balance between the rights and obli-
gations of members. 
(7) The WTO’s dispute settlement function, 
including in particular the Appellate Body, 
has increasingly failed to enforce the rules of 
the WTO in a timely manner, and has 
usurped the negotiating prerogative of mem-
bers by creating new obligations and rights 
that are inconsistent with or not included in 
the rules negotiated by members. 
(8) The creation of those obligations and 
rights undermines— 
(A) the WTO’s negotiating function by dis-
couraging members from making conces-
sions; and 
(B) the WTO’s dispute settlement function 
by encouraging overuse of the process and 
undermining its legitimacy, including by 
preventing free market economies from re-
sponding to globally trade distortive prac-
tices by nonmarket economies. 
(9) The WTO does not have sufficient rules 
to discipline the distortive economic policies 
of nonmarket economies, such as policies re-
lating to excess capacity and forced tech-
nology transfer, the special treatment those 
economies afford to state-owned enterprises, 
and their massive and opaque industrial sub-
sidies. 
(10) There is long-standing bipartisan sup-
port in Congress to reform the WTO to ad-
dress those failings. 
(11) The current presidential administra-
tion, as well as prior administrations, raised 
concerns about the failings described in this 
subsection and have made reform of the WTO 
a top priority of United States trade policy. 
(12) The United States urges WTO members 
to work constructively with the United 
States to assess the reasons why the existing 
WTO rules have proven inadequate in order 
to create an atmosphere within the WTO 
that is conducive to the development of new 
rules less subject to jurisprudential drift. 
(13) The guiding principle for reform of the 
WTO, and the lens through which WTO mem-
bers should consider specific reform pro-
posals, is the restoration of the WTO’s capa-
bility and capacity for negotiation among 
members. 
(14) The United States has achieved its 
trade policy objectives through active lead-
ership at the WTO, and an absence of that 
leadership would be filled by nonmarket 
economies that are hostile to a host of 
United States interests. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) while the United States finds value and 
usefulness in the WTO, in order to fulfill the 
needs of the United States and other free and 
open economies in the 21st century, signifi-
cant reforms are needed; 
(2) the United States must therefore con-
tinue to demonstrate leadership to achieve 
reforms that restore the effectiveness of the 
WTO’s— 
(A) negotiating function; 
(B) dispute settlement function so that it 
transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces 
outcomes negotiated by members rather 
than usurping their primacy by creating new 
rights or obligations; and 
(C) rules for special and differential treat-
ment to ensure those rules promote advance-
ment for truly developing countries, rather 
than becoming tools for globally competitive 
countries, like the People’s Republic of 
China, to engage in protectionism and mar-
ket distortions;

(3) the efforts to reform the negotiating 
function of the WTO should revitalize the ne-
gotiating function by providing confidence 
to members that the WTO operates accord-
ing to the rules as negotiated and adopted by 
members; 
(4) a revitalized negotiating function must 
include new rules that reflect the 21st cen-
tury economy, further combat anticompeti-
tive and protectionist barriers, and ensure 
disputes are efficiently resolved; 
(5) the United States Trade Representative 
should continue to lead efforts to work with 
WTO members to pursue reforms at the WTO 
that— 
(A) ensure the dispute settlement mecha-
nism faithfully applies the rules adopted by 
members, including by undertaking meas-
ures to ensure the WTO’s Appellate Body 
does not create new rights and obligations; 
(B) improve public confidence in dispute 
settlement by promoting greater trans-
parency and efficiency in the conduct of pro-
ceedings; 
(C) redress the consistent failure by cer-
tain members to satisfy their notification 
obligations under various WTO agreements, 
including through measures that strengthen 
accountability; 
(D) ensure rules for special and differential 
treatment are appropriately reserved for 
countries whose state of development and 
global competitiveness actually warrants 
such flexibility; 
(E) create new rules and structures that 
can serve the interests of the United States 
while promoting peace, prosperity, good gov-
ernance, transparency, effective operation of 
legal regimes, the rule of law, and free enter-
prise; and 
(F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations 
currently underway with Japan and the Eu-
ropean Union; and 
(6) the United States Trade Representative 
should explore and assess specific reform 
proposals, including— 
(A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that 
further the interests of the United States 
while limiting the benefits accruing to coun-
tries that are not parties to those agree-
ments; 
(B) efforts to ensure that incorrect inter-
pretations by the Appellate Body, including 
with respect to the Agreement on Safe-
guards, the Agreement on Implementation of 
Article VI of the General Agreement on Tar-
iffs and Trade 1994, and the Agreement on 
Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are 
corrected, and not to be deemed preceden-
tial; 
(C) new rules and norms to address prac-
tices of nonmarket economies, such as prac-
tices relating to state-owned enterprises, 
which certain countries often utilize for ob-
jectives that cause severe trade distortions; 
and 
(D) better implementation of existing 
rules, such as the prohibition in paragraph 4 
of Article XIV of the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade on currency manipulation, 
to ensure that those rules are effective to 
preserve the rights of free market econo-
mies.

SEC. 3234. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING 
UNIVERSAL 
IMPLEMENTATION 
OF 
UNITED 
NATIONS 
SANCTIONS 
ON 
NORTH KOREA. 
It is the policy of the United States to sus-
tain economic pressure on the Government 
of the Democratic People’s Republic of 
Korea (referred to in this section as the 
‘‘DPRK’’) until the regime undertakes con-
crete, 
verifiable 
actions 
toward 
denuclearization, including by— 
(1) pressing all nations, including the PRC, 
to implement and enforce existing United 
Nations sanctions with regard to the DPRK; 
(2) pressing all nations, including the PRC, 
and in accordance with United Nations Secu-
rity Council resolutions, to end the practice 
of hosting DPRK citizens as guest workers, 
recognizing that such workers are dem-
onstrated to constitute an illicit source of 
revenue for the DPRK regime and its nuclear 
ambitions; 
(3) pressing all nations, including the PRC, 
to pursue rigorous interdiction of shipments 
to and from the DPRK, including ship-to- 
ship transfers, consistent with United Na-
tions Security Council resolutions; 
(4) pressing the PRC and PRC entities— 
(A) to cease business activities with United 
Nations-designated entities and their affili-
ates in the DPRK; and 
(B) to expel from the PRC individuals who 
enable the DPRK to acquire materials for its 
nuclear and ballistic missile programs; 
(5) enforcing United Nations Security 
Council resolutions with respect to the 
DPRK and United States sanctions, includ-
ing those pursuant to the North Korea Sanc-
tions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 
(Public Law 114–122), the Countering Amer-
ica’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act 
(Public Law 115–44), the Otto Warmbier 
North Korea Nuclear Sanctions and Enforce-
ment Act of 2019 (title LXXI of division F of 
Public Law 116–92), and relevant United 
States executive orders; 
(6) welcoming the interagency review man-
dated by the national security memorandum 
issued by President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., on 
January 21, 2021, and entitled ‘‘National Se-
curity Memorandum on United States Global 
Leadership to Strengthen the International 
COVID–19 Response and to Advance Global 
Health Security and Biological Prepared-
ness’’, as an opportunity to make appro-
priate adjustments, consistent with existing 
law, to United States and multilateral sanc-
tions to ensure that such sanctions do not 
inadvertently hinder legitimate humani-
tarian access and travel to the DPRK; and 
(7) reinforcing eligibility for special valida-
tion travel to the DPRK related to repatri-
ation of the remains of United States vet-
erans from the Korean War, as is permitted 
under section 208(a)(3) of the North Korea 
Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of

TITLE ll—NATIONAL FAB LAB NETWORK 
SEC. lll1. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘National 
Fab Lab Network Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. lll2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Scientific discoveries and technical in-
novations are critical to the economic and 
national security of the United States. 
(2) Maintaining the leadership of the 
United States in science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics will require a di-
verse population with the skills, interest, 
and access to tools required to advance these 
fields. 
(3) Just as earlier digital revolutions in 
communications and computation provided 
individuals with the internet and personal 
computers, a digital revolution in fabrica-
tion will allow anyone to make almost any-
thing, anywhere. 
(4) These creations include elements of a 
typical household basket of goods (fur-
nishings, apparel, food production equip-
ment, shelter, transportation, education and 
communication, recreation, and other goods 
and services), personal technology, means for 
personal expression, the production of digital 
fabrication machinery, community design, 
and manufacturing capability. 
(5) The Center for Bits and Atoms of the 
Massachusetts 
Institute 
of 
Technology 
(CBA) has contributed significantly to the 
advancement of these goals through its work 
in creating and advancing digital fabrication 
facilities, or ‘‘fab labs’’ in the United States 
and abroad. 
(6) Such digital fabrication facilities may 
include 
MakerSpaces, 
Hackerspaces, 
and 
other creative spaces that use digital fab-
rication as a platform for education, innova-
tion, entrepreneurship, personal expression, 
public access, and social impact. 
(7) Such digital fabrication facilities pro-
vide a model for a new kind of national lab-
oratory that operates as a network, linking 
local facilities for advanced manufacturing, 
providing universal access, cultivating new 
literacies, and empowering communities.

(9) A coordinated array of national public- 
private partnerships will be the most effec-
tive way to accelerate the provision of uni-
versal access to this infrastructure for work-
force development, science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics education, devel-
oping inventions, creating businesses, pro-
ducing personalized products, and mitigating

TITLE IV—LIMITATIONS ON 
MODIFICATIONS TO TRADE AGREEMENTS 
SEC. 6401. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Section 8 of article I of the United 
States Constitution provides Congress with 
authority over international trade. Congress 
has used that authority to approve a number 
of trade agreements, including the WTO 
Agreement. 
(2) Section 8 of article I of the United 
States Constitution provides Congress with 
authority to provide intellectual property 
protections 
in 
order 
to 
‘‘promote 
the 
progress of science and useful arts’’. People 
in the United States rely on those protec-
tions to support jobs and continue the highly 
successful leadership of the United States 
with respect to innovation. 
(3) The United States may not withdraw or 
otherwise alter the rights and obligations for 
the United States arising from a congres-
sionally approved trade agreement without 
the consent of Congress. 
(4) The United States is a global leader in 
containing and ending the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
(5) Innovators in the United States suc-
cessfully and rapidly brought to fruition vac-
cines that provide highly effective protec-
tion against COVID–19. At facilities across 
the United States, thousands of United 
States workers are working around the clock 
to manufacture COVID–19 vaccines, contrib-
uting to the rapid, global scale up of manu-
facturing that is expected to reach at least 
10,000,000,000 doses by the end of 2021. 
(6) The United States is a founding member 
of the World Trade Organization. The United 
States has secured and supported critical 
commitments in the WTO for protection of 
intellectual property of United States per-
sons and globally, including under the Trade- 
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
Rights Agreement or the TRIPS Agreement. 
(7) In implementing the Uruguay Round, 
Congress established under section 315 of the 
Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 
3581) that it is the objective of the United 
States to ‘‘accelerate the implementation’’ 
of the TRIPS Agreement and to ‘‘seek enact-
ment and effective implementation by for-
eign countries of laws to protect and enforce 
intellectual property rights that supplement 
and strengthen the standards’’ of the TRIPS 
Agreement. 
(8) Longstanding intellectual property pro-
tections are critical to efforts by the United 
States and the biopharmaceutical industry 
to develop and manufacture vaccines for 
both people in the United States and around 
the world. 
(9) The United States is committed to pro-
viding global access to COVID–19 vaccines. 
(10) In order to accelerate production and 
distribution 
of 
COVID–19 
vaccines, 
bio-
pharmaceutical manufacturers in the United 
States are collaborating at a scale that pre-
viously was unimaginable, including by en-
tering into hundreds of voluntary manufac-
turing, production, and other partnerships 
around the world. 
(11) Manufacturing each of the COVID–19 
vaccines involves highly specialized and 
unique infrastructure and equipment, as well 
as highly trained and experienced personnel. 
Manufacturing and distributing safe and ef-
fective COVID–19 vaccines on a global scale 
is incredibly challenging. Many experts on 
vaccine production and distribution are 
warning that waiving intellectual property 
protections will undermine the global re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic and com-
promise vaccine safety, including by dis-
rupting the distribution of scarce raw mate-
rials for vaccines that existing vaccine mak-
ers with proven track records for delivering 
high-quality, safe, and effective vaccines 
need to continue their own production. 
(12) The United States Trade Representa-
tive announced without any consultation 
with Congress that the United States will 
support a waiver of intellectual property 
protections under the TRIPS Agreement for 
COVID–19 vaccines. That decision is not con-
sistent with the intellectual property negoti-
ating objectives of the United States set 
forth in section 315 of the Uruguay Round 
Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3581). 
(13) That waiver announcement created 
confusion, and raised concerns that a suc-
cessful effort to suspend protections will 
weaken already strained supply chains and 
foster the proliferation of ineffective and po-
tentially dangerous vaccines. 
(14) The Trade Representative has not ex-
plained how a waiver of the TRIPS Agree-
ment will expand vaccine production and ac-
cess, particularly considering that the major 
impediments to vaccination efforts include 
the following: 
(A) The difficulty in meeting the technical 
specifications 
of 
production 
and 
appro-
priately ensuring that finished vaccines are 
high-quality, safe, and effective. 
(B) The scarcity of raw materials for the 
vaccines. 
(C) Last-mile distribution and cold-chain 
storage. 
(D) Trade barriers to the free flow of inputs 
and finished products. 
(15) The Government of the People’s Re-
public of China and the Government of the 
Russian Federation are engaged in large 
scale industrial espionage and technology 
theft of intellectual property of United 
States persons. The Department of Justice 
has issued indictments in connection with 
attempts sponsored by the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China to steal 
United States vaccine research with respect 
to COVID–19. 
(16) The Government of the People’s Re-
public of China and the Government of the 
Russian Federation are using their vaccines 
as part of diplomatic efforts that may be 
contrary to the national security interests of 
the United States. Vaccines for COVID–19 
manufactured by persons in the People’s Re-
public of China and the Russian Federation 
appear to be less efficacious than those man-
ufactured by producers in the United States. 
The Academy of Military Science, the sci-
entific arm of the military of the People’s 
Republic of China, is sponsoring the prin-
cipal effort by the People’s Republic of China 
to develop its own mRNA vaccine. 
(17) At a hearing before the Committee on 
Finance of the Senate on May 12, 2021, the 
Trade Representative would not commit ei-
ther— 
(A) to ensure that any waiver of the TRIPS 
Agreement would exclude the People’s Re-
public of China and the Russian Federation; 
or 
(B) to ensure that Congress has advance 
access to the negotiating proposals of the 
United States for any such waiver. 
(18) 
The 
innovative 
biopharmaceutical 
companies in the United States contribute 
more than $1,100,000,000,000 annually to the 
United States economy, and employ more 
than 500,000 workers making 1.4 times the 
average earnings in the United States, in-
cluding 153,000 workers who do not have a 
college degree. 
(19) Waiving intellectual property protec-
tions, particularly of the mRNA technology 
platform in which the Defense Advanced Re-
search Project Agency invested not less than 
$250,000,000, raises serious economic and na-
tional security concerns. 
SEC. 6402. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the United States should continue to 
act as a global leader to help contain and end 
the COVID–19 pandemic at home and abroad; 
(2) innovators in the United States are al-
ready heroes for their breakthrough work in 
developing and producing COVID–19 vac-
cines. 
(3) it should be a priority of the global 
community, with the assistance of the 
United States, to efficiently and quickly 
manufacture and distribute COVID–19 vac-
cines around the world, and in particular to 
those countries that are most vulnerable; 
(4) current impediments to further vac-
cination efforts are due to— 
(A) the technically difficult manufacturing 
requirements for vaccines; 
(B) the need to appropriately ensure that 
vaccines are high-quality, safe, and effective; 
(C) raw material constraints; and 
(D) difficulties in distribution; 
(5) intellectual property protections for 
COVID–19 vaccines have not impeded vac-
cination efforts for COVID–19; 
(6) intellectual property protections in fact 
help ensure the safe and efficient manufac-
turing of COVID–19 vaccines; 
(7) waiving intellectual property protec-
tions could lead to the production of sub-
standard, ineffective, and potentially unsafe 
COVID–19 vaccines; 
(8) the Trade Representative must consult 
with Congress before taking a position on 
the current TRIPS Agreement waiver pro-
posal before the WTO and any further pro-
posals to waive or weaken intellectual prop-
erty obligations under the TRIPS Agree-
ment; 
(9) Congress and the people of the United 
States are entitled to comprehensive expert 
analysis regarding the implications of a 
waiver to the TRIPS Agreement for jobs, 
economic growth, public health, and na-
tional security in the United States; and 
(10) the United States must oppose any 
waiver to intellectual property obligations 
under the TRIPS Agreement for the response 
to the COVID–19 pandemic until those impli-
cations are fully analyzed.

CHINA. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The Thrift Savings Fund invests more 
than $700,000,000,000 on behalf of plan partici-
pants. As the guardian of the retirement 
funds of approximately 6,000,000 Federal ci-
vilian and military plan participants, it is 
critical that sums in the Thrift Savings 
Fund are not invested in securities linked to 
the economy of the People’s Republic of 
China. 
(2) Companies headquartered in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China have repeatedly com-
mitted corporate espionage, violated sanc-
tions imposed by the United States, flouted 
international 
property 
laws, 
committed 
theft, and failed to comply with audit and 
regulatory standards designed to safeguard 
investors. 
(3) The Thrift Savings Plan is known for 
its low management fees and comprehensive 
array of investment strategies. The provi-
sions of this section, and the amendments 
made by this section, will not increase fees 
imposed on participants of the Thrift Sav-
ings Plan. 
(4) The November 2017 selection of the 
MSCI ACWI Index by the Federal Retirement 
Thrift Investment Board, initially scheduled 
to be effective in 2020, would violate the 
terms of subsection (i) of section 8438 of title 
5, United States Code, as added by subsection 
(b)(1) of this section. 
(b) PROHIBITION ON ANY TSP FUND INVEST-
ING IN ENTITIES BASED IN THE PEOPLE’S RE-
PUBLIC OF CHINA.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Section 8438 of title 5, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(i) Notwithstanding any other provision 
of this section, no fund established or over-
seen by the Board may include an invest-
ment in any security of— 
‘‘(1) an entity based in the People’s Repub-
lic of China; or 
‘‘(2) any subsidiary that is owned or oper-
ated by an entity described in paragraph 
(1).’’. 
(2) DIVESTITURE OF ASSETS.—Not later than 
30 days after the date of enactment of this 
Act, the Federal Retirement Thrift Invest-
ment Board established under section 8472(a) 
of title 5, United States Code, shall— 
(A) review whether any sums in the Thrift 
Savings Fund are invested in violation of 
subsection (i) of section 8438 of that title, as 
added by paragraph (1) of this subsection; 
(B) if any sums are invested in the manner 
described in subparagraph (A), divest those 
sums in a manner that is consistent with the 
legal and fiduciary duties provided under 
chapter 84 of that title, or any other applica-
ble provision of law; and 
(C) reinvest any sums divested under sub-
paragraph (B) in investments that do not 
violate subsection (i) of section 8438 of that 
title, as added by paragraph (1) of this sub-
section. 
(c) PROHIBITION
ON
INVESTMENT
OF
TSP 
FUNDS
IN ENTITIES BASED
IN
THE PEOPLE’S 
REPUBLIC OF CHINA THROUGH THE TSP MU-
TUAL
FUND
WINDOW.—Section 8438(b)(5) of

adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(E) A mutual fund accessible through a 
mutual fund window authorized under this 
paragraph may not include an investment in 
any security of— 
‘‘(i) an entity based in the People’s Repub-
lic of China; or

QUALITY 
INFRASTRUC-
TURE INVESTMENT STANDARDS. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should ini-
tiate collaboration among governments, the 
private sector, and civil society to encourage 
the adoption of the standards for quality 
global infrastructure development advanced 
by the G20 at Osaka in 2018, including with 
respect to the following issues: 
(1) Respect for the sovereignty of countries 
in which infrastructure investments are 
made. 
(2) Anti-corruption. 
(3) Rule of law. 
(4) Human rights and labor rights. 
(5) Fiscal and debt sustainability. 
(6) Social and governance safeguards. 
(7) Transparency. 
(8) Environmental and energy standards. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the United States should 
launch a series of fora around the world 
showcasing the commitment of the United 
States and partners of the United States to 
high-quality development cooperation, in-
cluding with respect to the issues described 
in subsection (a). 
SEC. 3113. UNITED STATES SUPPORT FOR INFRA-
STRUCTURE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—The Global Infrastructure 
Coordinating Committee (GICC) was estab-
lished to coordinate the efforts of the De-
partment of State, the Department of Com-
merce, the Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Energy, the Department of 
Transportation, the United States Agency 
for International Development, the United 
States Trade and Development Agency, the 
Development Finance Corporation, the Ex-
port-Import Bank of the United States, and 
other agencies to catalyze private sector in-
vestments around the world and to coordi-
nate the deployment of United States Gov-
ernment technical assistance and develop-
ment finance tools, including project prepa-
ration services and commercial advocacy. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the world’s infrastructure needs, includ-
ing in the transport, energy, and digital sec-
tors, are vast and growing; 
(2) total or partial ownership or acquisi-
tion of, or a significant financial stake or 
physical presence in, certain types of infra-
structure, including ports, energy grids, 5G 
telecommunications networks, and undersea 
cables, can provide an advantage to coun-
tries that do not share the interests and val-
ues of the United States and its allies and 
partners, and could therefore be deleterious 
to the interests and values of the United 
States and its allies and partners; 
(3) the United States must continue to 
prioritize support for infrastructure projects 
that are physically secure, financially via-
ble, economically sustainable, and socially 
responsible; 
(4) achieving the objective outlined in 
paragraph (3) requires the coordination of all 
United States Government economic tools 
across the interagency, so that such tools 
are deployed in a way to maximize United 
States interests and that of its allies and 
partners; 
(5) the GICC represents an important and 
concrete step towards better communication 
and coordination across the United States 
Government of economic tools relevant to 
supporting infrastructure that is physically 
secure, financially viable, economically sus-
tainable, and socially responsible, and should 
be continued; and 
(6) the executive branch and Congress 
should have consistent consultations on 
United States support for strategic infra-
structure projects, including how Congress 
can support such initiatives in the future. 
(c) REPORTING
REQUIREMENT.—Not later 
than 180 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, and semi-annually thereafter for 
5 years, the Secretary of State, in coordina-
tion with other Federal agencies that par-
ticipate in the GICC, and, as appropriate, the

sistance, or other means; 
(2) a detailed explanation of the United 
States and partner country interests served 
by the United States providing support to 
such projects; and 
(3) a detailed description of any support 
provided by other United States allies and 
partners to such projects.

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. 
(a) LEADERSHIP
IN INTERNATIONAL STAND-
ARDS SETTING.—It is the sense of Congress 
that the United States must lead in inter-
national bodies that set the governance

interoperable, and stable digital domain. 
(b) 
COUNTERING
DIGITAL 
AUTHORITARIANISM.—It is the sense of Con-
gress that the United States, along with al-
lies and partners, should lead an inter-
national effort that utilizes all of the eco-
nomic and diplomatic tools at its disposal to

authoritarianism’’). 
(c) 
NEGOTIATIONS

DIGITAL
TRADE 
AGREEMENTS

ing alliance, and other nations, as appro-
priate. 
(d) FREEDOM OF INFORMATION IN THE DIG-
ITAL AGE.—It is the sense of Congress that 
the United States should lead a global effort

cluding the ability to safely consume or pub-
lish information without fear of undue re-
prisals, is maintained as the digital domain 
becomes an increasingly integral mechanism 
for communication.

sense of Congress that the United States 
should lead a global effort to develop and 
adopt a set of common principles and stand-
ards for critical technologies to ensure that 
the use of such technologies cannot be 
abused by malign actors, whether they are 
governments or other entities, and that they 
do not threaten democratic governance or 
human rights. 
(f) FORMATION
OF
DIGITAL
TECHNOLOGY

(4) promote exports of United States ICT 
goods and services and increase United 
States company market share in target mar-
kets;

SEC. 3133. FINDINGS ON CHINESE INFORMATION 
WARFARE AND MALIGN INFLUENCE 
OPERATIONS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) In the report to Congress required under 
section 1261(b) of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), the President 
laid out a broad range of malign activities 
conducted by the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China and its agents and enti-
ties, including— 
(A) propaganda and disinformation, in 
which ‘‘Beijing communicates its narrative 
through state-run television, print, radio, 
and online organizations whose presence is 
proliferating in the United States and 
around the world’’; 
(B) malign political influence operations, 
particularly ‘‘front organizations and agents 
which target businesses, universities, think 
tanks, scholars, journalists, and local state 
and Federal officials in the United States 
and around the world, attempting to influ-
ence discourse’’; and 
(C) malign financial influence operations, 
characterized as the ‘‘misappropriation of 
technology and intellectual property, failure 
to appropriately disclose relationships with 
foreign 
government 
sponsored 
entities, 
breaches of contract and confidentiality, and 
manipulation of processes for fair and merit- 
based allocation of Federal research and de-
velopment funding’’. 
(2) Chinese information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations are ongoing. In 
January 2019, then-Director of National In-
telligence, Dan Coats, stated, ‘‘China will 
continue to use legal, political, and eco-
nomic levers—such as the lure of Chinese 
markets—to shape the information environ-
ment. It is also capable of using cyber at-
tacks against systems in the United States 
to censor or suppress viewpoints it deems po-
litically sensitive.’’. 
(3) In February 2020, then-Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher 
Wray, testified to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary of the House of Representatives that 
the People’s Republic of China has ‘‘very ac-
tive [malign] foreign influence efforts in this 
country,’’ with the goal of ‘‘trying to shift 
our policy and our public opinion to be more 
pro-China on a variety of issues’’. 
(4) The PRC’s information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations continue to adopt 
new tactics and evolve in sophistication. In 
May 2020, then-Special Envoy and Coordi-
nator of the Global Engagement Center 
(GEC), Lea Gabrielle, stated that there was a 
convergence of Russian and Chinese nar-
ratives surrounding COVID–19 and that the 
GEC had ‘‘uncovered a new network of 
inauthentic Twitter accounts’’ that it as-
sessed was ‘‘created with the intent to am-
plify 
Chinese 
propaganda 
and 
disinformation’’. In June 2020, Google re-
ported that Chinese hackers attempted to 
access email accounts of the campaign staff 
of a presidential candidate. 
(5) Chinese information warfare and ma-
lign influence operations are a threat to the 
national security, democracy, and economic 
systems of the United States and its allies 
and partners. In October 2018, Vice President 
Michael R. Pence warned that ‘‘Beijing is 
employing a whole-of-government approach, 
using political, economic, and military tools, 
as well as propaganda, to advance its influ-
ence and benefit its interests in the United 
States.’’. 
(6) In February 2018, then-Director of the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Christopher 
Wray, testified to the Select Committee on 
Intelligence of the Senate that the People’s 
Republic of China is taking advantage of and 
exploiting the open research and develop-
ment environments of United States institu-
tions of higher education to utilize ‘‘profes-
sors, scientists and students’’ as ‘‘nontradi-
tional collectors’’ of information. 
(b) PRESIDENTIAL DUTIES.—The President 
shall— 
(1) protect our democratic institutions and 
processes from malign influence from the 
People’s Republic of China and other foreign 
adversaries; and 
(2) consistent with the policy specified in 
paragraph (1), direct the heads of the appro-
priate Federal departments and agencies to 
implement Acts of Congress to counter and 
deter PRC and other foreign information 
warfare and malign influence operations 
without delay, including— 
(A) section 1043 of the John S. McCain Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 
Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), which author-
izes a coordinator position within the Na-
tional Security Council for countering ma-
lign foreign influence operations and cam-
paigns; 
(B) section 228 of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public 
Law 116–92), which authorizes additional re-
search of foreign malign influence operations 
on social media platforms; 
(C) section 847 of such Act, which requires 
the Secretary of Defense to modify con-
tracting regulations regarding vetting for 
foreign ownership, control and influence in 
order to mitigate risks from malign foreign 
influence; 
(D) section 1239 of such Act, which requires 
an update of the comprehensive strategy to 
counter the threat of malign influence to in-
clude the People’s Republic of China; 
(E) section 5323 of such Act, which author-
izes the Director of National Intelligence to 
facilitate the establishment of Social Media 
Data and Threat Analysis Center to detect 
and study information warfare and malign 
influence operations across social media 
platforms; and 
(F) section 119C of the National Security 
Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes 
the establishment of a Foreign Malign Influ-
ence Response Center inside the Office of the 
Director of National Intelligence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3104 
May 19, 2021 
SEC. 3134. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS 
FOR 
THE 
FULBRIGHT-HAYS 
PRO-
GRAM. 
There are authorized to be appropriated, 
for the 5-year period beginning on October 1, 
2021, 
$105,500,000, 
to 
promote 
education, 
training, research, and foreign language 
skills through the Fulbright-Hays Program, 
in accordance with section 102(b) of the Mu-
tual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act 
of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2452(b)). 
SEC. 3135. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING 
ANTI-ASIAN RACISM AND DISCRIMI-
NATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) Since the onset of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, crimes and discrimination against 
Asians and those of Asian descent have risen 
dramatically worldwide. In May 2020, United 
Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres 
said ‘‘the pandemic continues to unleash a 
tsunami 
of 
hate 
and 
xenophobia, 
scapegoating 
and 
scare-mongering’’ 
and 
urged governments to ‘‘act now to strength-
en the immunity of our societies against the 
virus of hate’’. 
(2) Asian American and Pacific Island 
(AAPI) workers make up a large portion of 
the essential workers on the frontlines of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, making up 8.5 percent 
of all essential healthcare workers in the 
United States. AAPI workers also make up a 
large share—between 6 percent and 12 per-
cent based on sector—of the biomedical field. 
(3) The United States Census notes that 
Americans of Asian descent alone made up 
nearly 5.9 percent of the United States popu-
lation in 2019, and that Asian Americans are 
the fastest-growing racial group in the 
United States, projected to represent 14 per-
cent of the United States population by 2065. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the reprehensible attacks on people of 
Asian descent and concerning increase in 
anti-Asian sentiment and racism in the 
United States and around the world have no 
place in a peaceful, civilized, and tolerant 
world; 
(2) the United States is a diverse nation 
with a proud tradition of immigration, and 
the strength and vibrancy of the United 
States is enhanced by the diverse ethnic 
backgrounds and tolerance of its citizens, in-
cluding Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers; 
(3) the United States Government should 
encourage other foreign governments to use 
the official and scientific names for the 
COVID–19 pandemic, as recommended by the 
World Health Organization and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention; and 
(4) the United States Government and 
other governments around the world must 
actively oppose racism and intolerance, and 
use all available and appropriate tools to 
combat the spread of anti-Asian racism and 
discrimination. 
SEC. 3136. SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT MEDIA 
AND 
COUNTERING 
DISINFORMATION. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress makes the fol-
lowing findings: 
(1) The PRC is increasing its spending on 
public diplomacy including influence cam-
paigns, advertising, and investments into 
state-sponsored media publications outside 
of the PRC. These include, for example, more 
than $10,000,000,000 in foreign direct invest-
ment 
in 
communications 
infrastructure, 
platforms, and properties, as well as bringing 
journalists to the PRC for training pro-
grams. 
(2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, 
the United Front Work Department (UFWD), 
and UFWD’s many affiliates and proxies, has 
obtained unfettered access to radio, tele-
vision, and digital dissemination platforms 
in numerous languages targeted at citizens 
in other regions where the PRC has an inter-
est in promoting public sentiment in support 
of the Chinese Communist Party and expand-
ing the reach of its misleading narratives 
and propaganda. 
(3) Even in Western democracies, the PRC 
spends extensively on influence operations, 
such as a $500,000,000 advertising campaign to 
attract cable viewers in Australia and a 
more than $20,000,000 campaign to influence 
United States public opinion via the China 
Daily newspaper supplement. 
(4) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this sub-
section as ‘‘RFA’’), a private nonprofit 
multimedia news corporation, which broad-
casts in 9 East Asian languages including 
Mandarin, Uyghur, Cantonese, and Tibetan, 
has succeeded in its mission to reach audi-
ences in China and in the Central Asia region 
despite the Chinese Government’s— 
(A) 
efforts 
to 
practice 
‘‘media 
sov-
ereignty,’’ which restricts access to the free 
press within China; and 
(B) campaign to spread disinformation to 
countries abroad. 
(5) In 2019, RFA’s Uyghur Service alerted 
the world to the human rights abuses of 
Uyghur and other ethnic minorities in Chi-
na’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. 
(6) Gulchehra Hoja, a Uyghur journalist for 
RFA, received the International Women’s 
Media Foundation’s Courage in Journalism 
Award and a 2019 Magnitsky Human Rights 
Award for her coverage of Xinjiang, while 
the Chinese Government detained and har-
assed Ms. Hoja’s China-based family and the 
families of 7 other RFA journalists in retal-
iation for their role in exposing abuses. 
(7) In 2019 and 2020, RFA provided widely 
disseminated print and digital coverage of 
the decline in freedom in Hong Kong and the 
student-led protests of the extradition law. 
(8) In March 2020, RFA exposed efforts by 
the Chinese Government to underreport the 
number 
of 
fatalities 
from 
the 
novel 
coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan Province, 
China. 
(b) THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR GLOB-
AL MEDIA.—The United States Agency for 
Global Media (USAGM) and affiliate Federal 
and non-Federal entities shall undertake the 
following actions to support independent 
journalism, 
counter 
disinformation, 
and 
combat surveillance in countries where the 
Chinese Communist Party and other malign 
actors are promoting disinformation, propa-
ganda, and manipulated media markets: 
(1) Radio Free Asia (RFA) shall expand do-
mestic coverage and digital programming for 
all RFA China services and other affiliate 
language broadcasting services. 
(2) USAGM shall increase funding for 
RFA’s Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur, and Can-
tonese language services. 
(3) Voice of America shall establish a real- 
time disinformation tracking tool similar to 
Polygraph for Russian language propaganda 
and misinformation. 
(4) USAGM shall expand existing training 
and partnership programs that promote jour-
nalistic standards, investigative reporting, 
cybersecurity, and digital analytics to help 
expose and counter false CCP narratives. 
(5) The Open Technology Fund shall con-
tinue and expand its work to support tools 
and technology to circumvent censorship 
and surveillance by the CCP, both inside the 
PRC as well as abroad where the PRC has ex-
ported censorship technology, and increase 
secure peer-to-peer connectivity and privacy 
tools. 
(6) Voice of America shall continue and re-
view opportunities to expand its mission of 
providing timely, accurate, and reliable 
news, programming, and content about the 
United States, including news, culture, and 
values. 
(7) The networks and grantees of the 
United States Agency for Global Media shall 
continue their mission of providing credible 
and timely news coverage inclusive of the 
People’s Republic of China’s activities in 
Xinjiang, including China’s ongoing genocide 
and crimes against humanity with respect to 
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims, includ-
ing through strategic amplification of Radio 
Free Asia’s coverage, in its news program-

TITLE II—INVESTING IN ALLIANCES AND 
PARTNERSHIPS 
Subtitle A—Strategic and Diplomatic Matters 
SEC. 3201. APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CON-
GRESS DEFINED. 
In this subtitle, the term ‘‘appropriate 
committees of Congress’’ means— 
(1) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on Appropriations of the 
Senate; and 
(2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the 
House of Representatives. 
SEC. 3202. UNITED STATES COMMITMENT AND 
SUPPORT FOR ALLIES AND PART-
NERS IN THE INDO-PACIFIC. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the United States treaty alliances in 
the Indo-Pacific provide a unique strategic 
advantage to the United States and are 
among the Nation’s most precious assets, en-
abling the United States to advance its vital 
national interests, defend its territory, ex-
pand its economy through international 
trade and commerce, establish enduring co-
operation among like-minded countries, pre-
vent the domination of the Indo-Pacific and 
its surrounding maritime and air lanes by a 
hostile power or powers, and deter potential 
aggressors; 
(2) the Governments of the United States, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand are critical allies 
in advancing a free and open order in the 
Indo-Pacific region and tackling challenges 
with unity of purpose, and have collaborated 
to advance specific efforts of shared interest 
in areas such as defense and security, eco-
nomic 
prosperity, 
infrastructure 
connectivity, and fundamental freedoms; 
(3) the United States greatly values other 
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, in-
cluding with India, Singapore, Indonesia, 
Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam as well 
as regional architecture such as the Quad, 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Community (APEC), which are essential to 
further shared interests; 
(4) the security environment in the Indo- 
Pacific demands consistent United States 
and allied commitment to strengthening and 
advancing our alliances so that they are pos-
tured to meet these challenges, and will re-
quire sustained political will, concrete part-
nerships, economic, commercial, and techno-
logical cooperation, consistent and tangible 
commitments, high-level and extensive con-
sultations on matters of mutual interest, 
mutual and shared cooperation in the acqui-
sition of key capabilities important to allied 
defenses, and unified mutual support in the 
face of political, economic, or military coer-
cion; 
(5) fissures in the United States alliance 
relationships 
and 
partnerships 
benefit 
United States adversaries and weaken collec-
tive ability to advance shared interests; 
(6) the United States must work with allies 
to prioritize human rights throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region; 
(7) as the report released in August 2020 by 
the Expert Group of the International Mili-
tary 
Council 
on 
Climate 
and 
Security 
(IMCCS), titled ‘‘Climate and Security in the 
Indo-Asia Pacific’’ noted, the Indo-Pacific 
region is one of the regions most vulnerable 
to climate impacts and as former Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense for Installations 
and Environment Sherri Goodman, Sec-
retary General of IMCCS, noted, climate 
shocks act as a threat multiplier in the Indo- 
Pacific region, increasing humanitarian re-
sponse 
costs 
and 
impacting 
security 
throughout the region as sea levels rise, fish-
ing patterns shift, food insecurity rises, and 
storms grow stronger and more frequent; 
(8) the United State should continue to en-
gage on and deepen cooperation with allies 
and partners of the United States in the 
Indo-Pacific region, as laid out in the Asia 
Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115– 
409), in the areas of— 
(A) forecasting environmental challenges; 
(B) assisting with transnational coopera-
tion on sustainable uses of forest and water 
resources with the goal of preserving bio-
diversity and access to safe drinking water; 
(C) fisheries and marine resource conserva-
tion; and 
(D) meeting environmental challenges and 
developing resilience; and 
(9) the Secretary of State, in coordination 
with the Secretary of Defense and the Ad-
ministrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development, should facilitate 
a robust interagency Indo-Pacific climate re-
siliency and adaptation strategy focusing on 
internal and external actions needed— 
(A) to facilitate regional early recovery, 
risk reduction, and resilience to weather-re-
lated impacts on strategic interests of the 
United States and partners and allies of the 
United States in the region; and 
(B) to address humanitarian and food secu-
rity impacts of weather-related changes in 
the region. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to deepen diplomatic, economic, and se-
curity cooperation between and among the 
United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand, in-
cluding through diplomatic engagement, re-
gional development, energy security and de-
velopment, scientific and health partner-
ships, educational and cultural exchanges, 
missile defense, intelligence-sharing, space,

open, inclusive, resilient, and healthy Indo- 
Pacific that is characterized by democracy,

overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, 
democratic values, and territorial integrity, 
and to uphold peace and prosperity and 
strengthen democratic resilience; 
(3) the United States should seek to expand 
avenues of cooperation with the Quad, in-
cluding more regular military-to-military 
dialogues, joint exercises, and coordinated 
policies related to shared interests such as

time security; 
(4) the recent pledge from the first-ever 
Quad leaders meeting on March 12, 2021, to 
respond to the economic and health impacts

itime domains, further advances the impor-
tant cooperation among Quad nations that is

Pacific region, the United States Inter-
national Development Finance Corporation, 
the Japan International Cooperation Agen-
cy, and the Japan Bank for International Co-
operation, including through partnerships 
with other multilateral development banks,

cific region that are sustainable and offer a 
viable alternative to the investments of the 
People’s Republic of China in that region 
under the Belt and Road Initiative; 
(6) in consultation with other Quad coun-

motion to the same effect has been disagreed 
to. All points of order against the motion to 
proceed to the commission bill are waived. 
The motion to proceed is not debatable. The 
motion is not subject to a motion to post-
pone. A motion to reconsider the vote by

member) located outside the United States, 
if such establishment constitutes the reloca-
tion of the business unit so eliminated. For

members of such group (including any entity 
treated as a member of such group by reason 
of this paragraph). 
‘‘(5) OPERATING EXPENSES NOT TAKEN INTO 
ACCOUNT.—Any amount paid or incurred in 
connection with the ongoing operation of a 
business unit shall not be treated as an 
amount paid or incurred in connection with 
the establishment or elimination of such 
business unit.

‘‘(1) APPLICATION
TO
DEDUCTIONS
FOR
DE-
PRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.—In the case

retary may provide) of business units elimi-
nated within the United States.’’.

CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS DETER-
MINED WITHOUT REGARD

tion 952 of such Code is amended by adding

AND
PROFITS
DETERMINED

REGARD
TO

the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Taiwan is a free and prosperous democ-
racy of nearly 24,000,000 people and is an im-
portant contributor to peace and stability 
around the world. 
(2) Section 2(b) of the Taiwan Relations 
Act (Public Law 96–8; 22 U.S.C. 3301(b)) states 
that it is the policy of the United States— 
(A) ‘‘to preserve and promote extensive, 
close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and 
other relations between the people of the 
United States and the people on Taiwan, as 
well as the people on the China mainland and

economic interests of the United States, and

decision to establish diplomatic relations 
with the People’s Republic of China rests 
upon the expectation that the future of Tai-
wan will be determined by peaceful means’’; 
(D) ‘‘to consider any effort to determine 
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful 
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, 
a threat to the peace and security of the 
Western Pacific area and of grave concern to 
the United States’’;

fensive character’’; and

other forms of coercion that would jeop-
ardize the security, or the social or economic 
system, of the people on Taiwan’’.

Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2016, the

China has intensified its efforts to pressure 
Taiwan through diplomatic isolation and

vers in and around the Taiwan Strait illus-
trate a clear threat to Taiwan’s security.

Congress that— 
(1) both the United States and Taiwan have 
made significant strides since 1979 in bol-
stering their defense relationship;

matically increased the capability of its 
military forces since 1979; 
(3) the People’s Republic of China has in 
recent years increased the use of its military 
forces to harass and provoke Taiwan with 
the threat of overwhelming force; and 
(4) it is the policy of the United States to 
consider any effort to determine the future 
of Taiwan by anything other than peaceful 
means, including by boycotts or embargoes,

Western Pacific area, and of grave concern to 
the United States.

TITLE 
ll—REVITALIZING 
MULTILAT-
ERAL EXPORT CONTROL DIPLOMACY 
FOR CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES ACT 
SEC. ll01. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘Revital-
izing Multilateral Export Control Diplomacy 
for Critical Technologies Act’’. 
SEC. ll02. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) United States arms embargoed coun-
tries are implementing malign and aggres-
sive industrial policies using non-market 
means and engaging in predatory investment 
to gain control of critical technologies in 
order to achieve market dominance and con-
trol supply chains. 
(2) These countries integrate their indus-
trial policies into initiatives that break 
down the barriers and distinctions between 
the commercial sector and the military to 
ensure that critical technologies support the 
development of their military. 
(3) These countries seek to obtain critical 
technologies from the United States and cov-
ered United States allies and partners. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the fast-paced nature of technological 
innovation and the systemic diversion of 
technological innovation and know-how by 
United States arms embargoed countries for 
the benefit of developing and enhancing 
their militaries, challenges the effectiveness 
of existing multilateral fora established spe-
cifically to prevent such export control 
risks, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement; 
and 
(2) the ability of United States arms em-
bargoed countries to access critical tech-
nologies that affect the national security of 
the United States should spur the United 
States to work with covered United States 
allies and partners to develop unified export 
control policies to eliminate or substantially 
reduce the global availability of critical 
technologies to United States arms embar-
goed countries. 
SEC. ll03. STRATEGY TO CONTROL THE AVAIL-
ABILITY 
OF 
CRITICAL 
TECH-
NOLOGIES. 
(a) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It is the policy 
of the United States to— 
(1) work with covered United States allies 
and partners to develop unified export con-
trol policies to eliminate or substantially re-
duce the global availability of critical tech-
nologies to United States arms embargoed 
countries, including by— 
(A) leading regular and rapid bilateral and 
plurilateral negotiations with respect to spe-
cific critical technologies with different 
groupings of such allies and partners; 
(B) using policy instruments, including 
tax, investment, licensing, lending, and 
trade, to provide incentives to such allies 
and partners; and 
(C) using, if necessary, existing authori-
ties, including trade remedies, the United 
States Munitions List, the Entity List, eco-
nomic sanctions, and other authorities avail-
able under the International Emergency 
Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); 
(2) ensure critical technologies do not ad-
vance the economic strategies, industrial 
policy goals, or military capabilities of 
United States arms embargoed countries; 
(3) carry out joint research and develop-
ment projects with covered United States al-
lies and partners, with adequate safeguards 
for the protection and promotion of any re-
sulting intellectual property, to— 
(A) advance a broad range of scientific and 
technical disciplines, including with respect 
to critical technologies that may be affected 
by the implementation of the strategy re-
quired by subsection (b); and 
(B) develop alternative markets to com-
pensate for lost sales opportunities; and 
(4) enhance the sharing of information 
with covered United States allies and part-
ners that have entered into a multilateral 
export control agreement with the United 
States described in section ll04(d). 
(b) STRATEGY.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—The President, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Commerce, 
the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of 
State, the Director of National Intelligence, 
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Sec-
retary of Energy, shall develop a strategy to 
work with covered United States allies and 
partners to develop unified export control 
policies to eliminate or substantially reduce 
the global availability of critical tech-
nologies to United States arms embargoed 
countries. 
(2) INDUSTRY CONSULTATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The President shall— 
(i) inform and solicit input in writing from 
representatives of relevant United States in-
dustries in developing the strategy required 
by paragraph (1); and 
(ii) submit to the appropriate congres-
sional committees input received pursuant 
to clause (i). 
(B) DISCLOSURE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMA-
TION
PROHIBITED.—No such committee, or 
member thereof, may disclose any informa-
tion made available under subparagraph 
(A)(ii) that is submitted on a confidential 
basis unless the committee determines that 
the withholding of that information is con-
trary to the national interest of the United 
States. 
(3) MATTERS TO BE INCLUDED.—The strategy 
required by this subsection shall include the 
following: 
(A) An identification of critical tech-
nologies that are priorities for— 
(i) the national security and the defense in-
dustrial base of the United States; and 
(ii) the economic strategies, industrial

uct (as defined in part 25.003 of the Federal

ance with the needs of agencies, divisions,

gram on the domestic supply chain, cost ef-
fectiveness of the program, and access to 
covered testing equipment and personal pro-
tective equipment for the Federal agencies 
and health care entities pursuant to subpara-
graph (B)(i)(II). 
‘‘(E) COVERED TESTING EQUIPMENT AND PER-
SONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.—For purposes 
of this paragraph, the term ‘covered testing 
equipment and personal protective equip-
ment’ means test supplies (which may in-
clude test kits, reagents, and swabs), res-
pirators, masks, gloves, eye and face protec-

SA 1632. Mr. SCOTT of Florida sub-
mitted an amendment intended to be 
proposed to amendment SA 1502 pro-
posed by Mr. SCHUMER to the bill S. 
1260, to establish a new Directorate for 
Technology and Innovation in the Na-
tional Science Foundation, to establish 
a regional technology hub program, to 
require a strategy and report on eco-
nomic security, science, research, inno-
vation, manufacturing, and job cre-
ation, to establish a critical supply 
chain resiliency program, and for other 
purposes; which was ordered to lie on 
the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title II of divi-
sion C, add the following: 
SEC. 3236. SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR THE 
UNITED STATES MILITARY. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The United States faces numerous na-
tional security threats from around the 
world, including from the People’s Republic 
of China, the Russian Federation, the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic Re-
public of Korea, and international terrorist 
and crime networks aided by United States 
enemies, such as the Republic of Cuba and 
the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
(2) The United States is engaged in a new 
Cold War with the People’s Republic of 
China, which is— 
(A) building up its military to defeat the 
United States; 
(B) stealing United States intellectual 
property and jobs; 
(C) harassing neighboring Asian countries 
and United States allies and partners; 
(D) 
committing 
genocide 
against 
the 
Uyghurs; and 
(E) denying basic rights to the people of 
Hong Kong. 
(3) The People’s Republic of China is fo-
cused on world domination through oppres-
sion and communist rule. 
(4) According to prominent research insti-
tutions, including the Center for Strategic 
and International Studies and the Stock-
holm International Peace Research Insti-
tute, the Chinese Communist Party has in-
creased its defense spending more than 700 
percent during the last decade, with an addi-
tional 6.8 percent increase anticipated in this 
fiscal year. 
(5) Security and foreign policy experts 
widely acknowledge that— 
(A) the People’s Republic of China is not 
forthcoming or transparent with information 
related to military spending; and 
(B) China’s military spending may be con-
siderably higher than its reported figures. 
(6) The National Defense Strategy Commis-
sion, in its report, Providing for the Common 
Defense: The Assessment and Recommendation 
of the States, recommended that ‘‘Congress 
increase the base defense budget at an aver-
age rate of three to five percent above infla-
tion through the Future Years Defense Pro-
gram and perhaps beyond’’. 
(7) When considering the inflation crisis he 
has created, President Biden’s proposed de-
fense budget would represent a cut to spend-
ing, despite— 
(A) new and mounting threats to United 
States national security and to our allies; 
and 
(B) the need for sufficient military support 
to deter our enemies and maintain the most 
lethal fighting force in the world. 
(8) President Biden’s proposed budget re-
quest includes $715,000,000,000 for the Depart-
ment of Defense, which is well below the 
funding needed to keep pace with inflation, 
while the President’s nondefense discre-
tionary spending request is $769,400,000,000, 
which represents an increase of 15.9 percent 
compared to the current fiscal year. 
(9) In the Department of Defense’s fiscal 
year 2021 Future Years Defense Program, the 
projected request for the Department of De-
fense in fiscal year 2022 was targeted at 
$722,000,000,000, which is $7,000,000,000 higher 
than President Biden’s actual defense budget 
request for fiscal year 2022. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) President Biden’s defense budget— 
(A) does not provide adequate resources to 
deter or defeat United States enemies; 
(B) does not even keep up with inflation; 
and 
(C) does not restore our military readiness 
that was diminished by budget cuts and the 
sequester under President Barack Obama, 
which arbitrarily reduced defense spending 
across the board; 
(2) the lack of sufficient funding will re-
quire the Department of Defense to choose 
between— 
(A) 
providing 
for 
United 
States 
servicemembers’ compensation and benefits; 
(B) providing for United States forces’ 
modernization and readiness needs; and 
(C) any other priorities that the Biden Ad-
ministration chooses to pursue; 
(3) President Biden’s decision to reduce de-
fense spending— 
(A) harms the United States’s long-term 
strategic competition against the People’s 
Republic of China and other adversaries; and 
(B) weakens our standing on the global 
stage; and 
(4) the Biden Administration should work 
with Congress to ensure that the United 
States military has all the necessary re-
sources to build and sustain the over-
whelming military might that the United 
States expects and deserves. 
SA 1633. Ms. WARREN submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr. 
SCHUMER to the bill S. 1260, to establish

Congress that—

the Indo-Pacific provide a unique strategic 
advantage to the United States, enabling the 
United States to advance its vital national 
interests, defend its territory, expand its 
economy through international trade and 
commerce, prevent the domination of the 
Indo-Pacific and its surrounding maritime 
and air lanes by a hostile power or powers, 
and deter potential aggressors; 
(2) the Governments of the United States, 
Japan, the Republic of Korea, Australia, the 
Philippines, and Thailand are critical allies 
in advancing a free and open order in the 
Indo-Pacific region and tackling challenges 
with unity of purpose, and have collaborated 
to advance specific efforts of shared interest 
in areas such as defense and security, eco-
nomic 
prosperity, 
infrastructure 
connectivity, and fundamental freedoms; 
(3) the United States greatly values other 
partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, in-
cluding with India, Singapore, Indonesia, 
Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam as well 
as regional architecture such as the Quad, 
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations 
(ASEAN), and the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Community (APEC), which are essential to 
further shared interests; 
(4) the security environment in the Indo- 
Pacific demands consistent United States 
and allied commitment to strengthening and 
advancing our alliances so that they are pos-
tured to meet these challenges, and will re-
quire sustained political will, concrete part-
nerships, economic, commercial, and techno-
logical cooperation, consistent and tangible 
commitments, high-level and extensive con-
sultations on matters of mutual interest, 
mutual and shared cooperation in the acqui-
sition of key capabilities important to allied 
defenses, and unified mutual support in the 
face of political, economic, or military coer-
cion; 
(5) the United States must work with allies 
to prioritize human rights throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region; 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to deepen diplomatic, economic, and se-
curity cooperation between and among the 
United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand, in-
cluding through diplomatic engagement, re-
gional development, energy security and de-
velopment, scientific and health partner-
ships, educational and cultural exchanges, 
missile defense, intelligence-sharing, space, 
cyber, and other diplomatic and defense-re-
lated initiatives; 
(2) to strengthen and deepen the United 
States’ bilateral and regional partnerships, 
including with India, Taiwan, ASEAN, and 
New Zealand; 
(3) to cooperate with Japan, the Republic 
of Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and 
Thailand to promote human rights bilat-
erally and through regional and multilateral 
fora and pacts; 
(4) to strengthen and advance diplomatic, 
economic, and security cooperation with re-
gional partners, such as Taiwan, Vietnam,

PERTAINING

GION OF ETHIOPIA 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 25, S. Res. 97. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 97) calling on the 
Government of Ethiopia, the Tigray People’s 
Liberation Front, and other belligerents to 
cease all hostilities, protect human rights, 
allow unfettered humanitarian access, and 
cooperate with independent investigations of 
credible atrocity allegations pertaining to 
the conflict in the Tigray Region of Ethi-
opia. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic and an amendment to 
the preamble to strike the preamble 
and insert the part printed in italic, 
and an amendment to the title as fol-
lows: 
Whereas the United States and the Federal 
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia share an im-
portant relationship and more than a century of 
diplomatic relations; 
Whereas Ethiopia is the second most populous 
country in Africa and plays a key role in ad-
vancing security and stability across sub-Saha-
ran Africa, including as a top contributor of 
uniformed personnel to United Nations peace-
keeping missions; 
Whereas tensions between Prime Minister 
Abiy Ahmed’s Prosperity Party and the Tigray 
People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), which was 
part of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia until 
late 2019, escalated when the TPLF held elec-
tions in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia on Sep-
tember 9, 2020, despite the decision by the Fed-
eral Government of Ethiopia to postpone general 
elections due to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the TPLF rejected the postponement 
of general elections and considered the exten-
sion of the term of the Federal Government to be 
unconstitutional, and the Federal Government 
subsequently deemed the Tigray regional elec-
tions illegitimate; 
Whereas, in the early hours of November 4, 
2020, Prime Minister Abiy ordered a military of-
fensive in response to an attack by the TPLF on 
the Northern Command of the Ethiopian Na-
tional Defense Forces (ENDF), which evolved 
into an armed conflict between the ENDF and 
allied forces on one side and the TPLF on the 
other side, with thousands of deaths reported; 
Whereas the Government of Ethiopia rejected 
all offers, including one extended by African 
Union Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa in November 
2020, to mediate talks with the TPLF; 
Whereas, on November 28, 2020, the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia claimed victory in the conflict 
after taking Mekelle, the capital city of the 
Tigray Region, with Prime Minister Abiy an-
nouncing that his forces had ‘‘completed and 
ceased the military operations’’ and would shift 
focus to rebuilding the region and providing hu-
manitarian assistance while Federal police at-
tempt to apprehend leaders of the TPLF; 
Whereas clashes have continued in the Tigray 
Region and Ethiopian soldiers and allied forces 
have pursued prominent TPLF leaders, notably 
killing former Minister of Foreign Affairs of 
Ethiopia Seyoum Mesfin as part of a ‘‘stabi-
lizing mission . . . to bring to justice perpetra-
tors’’; 
Whereas, in 2020, prior to the outbreak of 
fighting in the Tigray Region, there were more 
than 1,800,000 people internally displaced in 
Ethiopia and approximately 2,000,000 people in 
the Tigray Region were already in need of hu-
manitarian assistance; 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray Region has 
prompted more than 61,000 Ethiopians to seek 
refuge in Sudan, has displaced as many as 
500,000 people internally, and has caused severe 
shortages of food, water, medical supplies, and 
other necessary goods for those who remain in 
the region; 
Whereas the conflict has disrupted harvests, 
livelihoods, markets, and supply chains, food 
and medical supplies have been looted, and re-
strictions and bureaucratic impediments con-
tinue to constrain the humanitarian response, 
with nearly 4,000,000 people in the Tigray Re-
gion estimated to require urgent food assistance, 
including 100,000 Eritrean refugees; 
Whereas, during the first few weeks of the 
conflict, there was a complete shutdown of elec-
tricity, banking, internet, and telephone services 
throughout the Tigray Region by the Govern-
ment of Ethiopia, with government reports of 
TPLF forces also destroying communications in-
frastructure, and subsequent service restorations 
have been limited; 
Whereas, in addition to the shutdown of tele-
phone and internet services, which has severely 
limited the flow of information on the conflict 
and the humanitarian situation, journalists 
have been restricted from accessing much of the 
Tigray Region, several journalists have been ar-
rested in connection to their coverage of the 
conflict, and one journalist working for the 
Tigray Mass Media Agency was killed; 
Whereas, although the Government of Ethi-
opia entered into an agreement with the United 
Nations on November 29, 2020, to facilitate hu-
manitarian access to the Tigray Region, that ac-
cess is not yet unfettered; 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, the Secretary 
General of the Norwegian Refugee Council stat-
ed, ‘‘Twelve weeks since the fighting began, the 
basic elements of a response on the scale needed 
are still not in place. It is false to say that aid 
is increasingly getting through. Aid has only 
gone to the places with little conflict and more 
limited needs and is not keeping pace with the 
humanitarian crisis as it inevitably grows over 
time.’’; 
Whereas, on February 6, 2021, the United Na-
tions World Food Programme (WFP) announced 
a new agreement with the Government of Ethi-
opia to rapidly scale up the deployment of emer-
gency food assistance while improving the proc-
ess for reviewing and approving requests from 
United Nations and humanitarian partner agen-
cies; 
Whereas humanitarian access to the refugee 
camps that were home to almost 100,000 Eritrean 
refugees at the start of the conflict has been es-
pecially 
restricted, 
with 
the 
Hitsats 
and 
Shimelba camps still completely inaccessible, 
and the United Nations Refugee Agency esti-
mates that 20,000 Eritrean refugees displaced 
from those camps remain unaccounted for; 
Whereas United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees Filippo Grandi has expressed alarm 
about the ‘‘overwhelming number of disturbing 
reports of Eritrean refugees in Tigray being 
killed, abducted and forcibly returned to Eri-
trea’’; 
Whereas, in November 2020, four humani-
tarian workers, including one employee of the 
International Rescue Committee and three em-
ployees of the Danish Refugee Council, were 
killed at Hitsats refugee camp; 
Whereas challenges to access have signifi-
cantly restricted the reporting and documenta-
tion of atrocities, but survivor and eye-witness 
testimony and satellite imagery have enabled re-
ports to emerge of targeted violence or indis-
criminate attacks against civilians committed by 
multiple parties to the conflict; 
Whereas examples of reported atrocities com-
mitted in the Tigray Region include the mas-
sacre in the town of Mai Kadra on November 9, 
2020, in which, according to estimates from the 
Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC), 
more than 600 civilians died from what the 
EHRC Chief Commissioner concluded was ‘‘for 
no reason other than their ethnicity,’’ and a 
mass killing in the city of Axum on November 28 
through 29, 2020, which involved, according to 
reports from Amnesty International, the system-
atic killing of ‘‘hundreds of unarmed civilians’’ 
after Ethiopian and Eritrean troops retook the 
city; 
Whereas United Nations Special Representa-
tive of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence 
in Conflict Pramila Patten has highlighted re-
ports of sexual and gender-based violence, in-
cluding a high number of alleged rapes in 
Mekelle; 
Whereas, on January 27, 2021, the United 
States Government publicly confirmed that Eri-
trean Defense Forces (EDF) are participating in 
the conflict in alliance with the ENDF and 
called for the immediate withdrawal of all EDF 
soldiers from the Tigray Region, and credible re-
ports have emerged that EDF soldiers partici-
pating in the conflict have attacked civilians, 
including Eritrean refugees, and looted and de-
stroyed homes and religious institutions; 
Whereas Ethiopia has been beset for nearly a 
decade by multiple human rights and humani-
tarian challenges, including targeted ethnic vio-
lence, intercommunal conflict, natural disasters, 
and political unrest; 
Whereas, since mid-2020, the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, Amnesty International, and the Ethio-
pian Human Rights Commission have reported 
atrocities and a rise in ethnic and intercom-
munal violence in other parts of Ethiopia, in-
cluding in the Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, 
Somali, Afar, and Oromia regions; 
Whereas, according to international human 
rights organizations, during the conflict in the 
Tigray Region, ethnic Tigrayans throughout 
Ethiopia have been suspended from their jobs 
and prevented from leaving the country, and 
there are reports of surveillance and mass ar-
rests of citizens of Ethiopia based on their eth-
nicity; 
Whereas, in March 2021, President Biden 
asked Senator Christopher Coons to serve as an 
emissary to convey the President’s grave con-
cerns to Prime Minister Abiy about the humani-
tarian crisis and human rights abuses in the 
Tigray Region and the risk of broader insta-
bility in the Horn of Africa;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3172 
May 19, 2021 
Whereas Ethiopia is undergoing a fragile po-
litical transition, with the postponed 2020 gen-
eral elections rescheduled for June 2021, except 
in the Tigray Region, where elections have not 
yet been scheduled; 
Whereas the Government of Ethiopia has re-
stricted the right of several opposition political 
parties to peacefully assemble and organize, and 
a number of opposition leaders have been jailed 
since the summer of 2020, with varying degrees 
of due process violations and procedural delays 
in their trials, leading some major opposition 
parties to threaten to withdraw from the forth-
coming general elections; 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray Region, 
intercommunal violence in other parts of Ethi-
opia, and the erosion of political and civic space 
calls into the question whether the general elec-
tions in June 2021 can meet the aspirations and 
expectations of the Ethiopian people and inter-
nationally accepted standards for free and fair 
elections; and 
Whereas the conflict in the Tigray Region oc-
curs within the context of complicated regional 
and global dynamics, including ongoing nego-
tiations between Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan 
over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, 
Ethiopia’s rapprochement with Eritrea, threats 
posed by the violent extremist organization Al- 
Shabaab, a struggle for influence and power 
among regional and global actors, increasingly 
hostile border disputes between Ethiopia and 
Sudan, and the fragile democratic transition 
and peace process in Sudan: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, 
That the Senate— 
(1) calls for the immediate cessation of hos-
tilities in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia; 
(2) condemns in the strongest terms all vio-
lence against civilians; 
(3) calls on the Government of Eritrea to im-
mediately and fully withdraw its military forces 
from Ethiopia, and condemns in the strongest

Tigray Region or elsewhere in Ethiopia; 
(4) strongly disapproves of the escalation of 
political tensions between the Government of 
Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation

of electricity, banking, telephone, and internet 
services throughout the Tigray Region and 
other parts of Ethiopia where communications 
have been restricted; 
(6) appreciates the willingness of Sudan to 
welcome refugees fleeing the conflict in the 
Tigray Region; 
(7) urges the Government of Ethiopia to— 
(A) take tangible steps toward improving hu-
manitarian access in keeping with commitments 
made to the United Nations World Food Pro-
gramme and Secretary of State Antony Blinken; 
(B) pursue accountability for human rights 
abuses and atrocities; and 
(C) make progress on other key issues with re-
gard to the conflict in the Tigray Region and 
threats to regional stability following the visit of 
Senator Coons; 
(8) calls on the Government of Ethiopia to— 
(A) ensure that any apprehensions of TPLF 
members are carried out with the least possible 
use of force and that the rights to which those 
detained are entitled under Ethiopian and inter-
national law are fully respected; 
(B) require the immediate and full withdrawal 
of Eritrean forces from Ethiopia; 
(C) release all opposition leaders, supporters, 
and activists detained on the basis of their polit-
ical activity and views as well as journalists de-
tained on the basis of their reporting, and re-
spect the rights of all Ethiopians to free expres-
sion and political participation, without dis-
crimination based on ethnicity, ideology, or po-
litical affiliation; and 
(D) convene a credible and countrywide proc-
ess of national dialogue and reconciliation in-
clusive of all nonviolent political parties, ethnic 
communities, religious groups, and civil society 
organizations in Ethiopia to work toward the 
sustainable resolution of grievances and chart a 
democratic and peaceful path forward for the 
country; 
(9) urges all parties to the conflict to— 
(A) cease all hostilities, commit to a political 
solution for resolving existing differences, fully 
comply with international humanitarian law, 
and refrain from actions that could continue, 
spread, or escalate the conflict, particularly at-
tacks on civilian targets; 
(B) make demonstrable progress to guarantee 
unfettered and immediate humanitarian access, 
for personnel and supplies, to areas affected by 
the conflict, and take all possible steps to pro-
tect the safety of civilians, including refugees, 
displaced persons, and humanitarian aid work-
ers; and 
(C) allow for, and cooperate with, inde-
pendent and transparent investigations of any 
alleged human rights abuses committed in the 
course of the conflict in the Tigray Region and 
other conflicts across Ethiopia, and hold per-
petrators to account in a credible process; and 
(10) urges the Secretary of State, the Secretary 
of the Treasury, and the Administrator of the 
United States Agency for International Develop-
ment, in coordination with the heads of other 
relevant Federal departments and agencies, to—

of the Government of Ethiopia, the Government 
of Eritrea, and the TPLF to encourage the full 
cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of 
Eritrean forces, mitigate the humanitarian crisis 
that has emerged from the conflict, and support 
an inclusive process of national dialogue and 
reconciliation; 
(B) immediately establish criteria to end the 
pause of all non-life-sustaining assistance to 
Ethiopia and support programming to meet im-
mediate humanitarian needs, including of refu-
gees and internally displaced persons, advance 
nonviolent conflict resolution and reconciliation 
throughout the country, and aid a democratic 
transition in Ethiopia; 
(C) take continued actions to ensure that a 
‘‘full, independent, international investigation 
into all reports of human rights violations, 
abuses, and atrocities’’ committed in the course 
of the conflict as called for by Secretary of State 
Blinken on February 27, 2021, is conducted, and 
impose strict accountability measures on those 
found responsible; 
(D) use all diplomatic, developmental, and 
legal tools to prevent further ethnic-based vio-
lence and mass atrocities, including by non- 
state armed groups, and promote competitive 
multi-party democracy in Ethiopia; and 
(E) maintain close coordination with inter-
national allies and multilateral organizations 
regarding efforts to address the conflict in the 
Tigray Region and other regions of Ethiopia 
and bring attention to the conflict in inter-
national fora, including the United Nations Se-
curity Council.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER ROGER 
MILLER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Roger 
Miller for his 40 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children. Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Miller has worked throughout his 
career to serve the people of Somerset Coun-
ty. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank him for his work to pro-
tect life and property in our community and 
wish him continued health, safety, and suc-
cess.

CONDEMNING 
THE 
HORRIFIC 
SHOOTINGS IN ATLANTA, GEOR-
GIA ON MARCH 16, 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 18, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as 
Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, 
Homeland Security, and Terrorism, and a sen-
ior member of the Homeland Security, and 
Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of 
H. Res. 275—Condemning the horrific shoot-
ings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021, 
and reaffirming the House of Representative’s 
commitment to combating hate, bigotry, and 
violence against the Asian-American and Pa-
cific Islander community. 
Madam Speaker, we all awoke earlier this 
year to the horrific news that in suburban At-
lanta, Georgia, a 21-year old angry white man 
murdered 8 persons at three Asian massage 
spas. 
Among the innocent victims were 6 young 
Asian American women who worked in the es-
tablishments. 
The suspected perpetrator of these brutal 
crimes has been arrested and charged with 8 
counts of murder. 
According to the Atlanta Police Department, 
the killer is reported to have told police that he 
has an issue, what he considers a ‘sex addic-
tion,’ and ‘sees these [Asian massage spa] lo-
cations as something that allows him to go to 
these places’ and ‘it is a temptation for him 
that he wanted to eliminate.’ 
Adding insult to injury, a Georgia sheriff’s 
captain, acting as spokesperson for law en-
forcement investigators, characterized the kill-
er as ‘‘having a really bad day.’’ 
Madam Speaker, since the beginning of the 
COVID–19 pandemic in March 2020, there 
has been a significant increase in harassment 
and violence against the Asian American com-
munity. 
Unfortunately, this is not new; there is a 
long history of racism again Asian Americans, 
especially during times of social and economic 
unrest. 
Throughout American history Asian Ameri-
cans are often blamed for the emergence of 
pandemics and diseases, even if the sickness 
originated far outside the Asian American 
community. 
The COVID–19 pandemic is no exception, 
as American citizens, and residents of actual 
or perceived Chinese descent, have received 
intense and unjust scrutiny, violence, and har-
assment as perpetrators associate them with 
the cause of the pandemic and resulting social 
and economic turmoil. 
And the racist practice of the 45th President 
of always referring to the coronavirus as the 
‘‘China Virus,’’ or ‘‘Kung Flu’’ certainly contrib-
uted to, and inflamed, an already dangerous 
climate for persons of Asian descent. 
Asian migration to the continental United 
States can be traced as far back as 1800’s. 
Despite their long residence in the country, 
throughout American history Asian American 
communities have been stigmatized as per-
petual foreigners. 
These xenophobic sentiments are especially 
exacerbated in times of social and economic 
discontent, leaving Asian American commu-
nities vulnerable to white supremacist and rac-
ist violence and harassment. 
Especially notable to today, historically anti- 
Asian racism often associates Asian commu-
nities with illness—leaving Asian Americans 
particularly vulnerable to medical scapegoating 
and violence during epidemics. 
Xenophobia and racism against the Asian 
American community continued well into the 
20th century. 
Most infamously, in 1942 President Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 
9066, which ordered the forced internment of 
120,000 Japanese Americans during World 
War II. 
While American immigration policies’ still 
forbade the free migration of Asian immigrants 
into the country, thousands of Japanese- 
Americans had lived in the United States for 
decades, many of whom were second and 
third-generation Americans. 
As the 1980 investigation and report of the 
Commission on Wartime Relocation and In-
ternment of Civilians would later conclude, 
Japanese internment was primarily driven by 
racism and xenophobia rather than a legiti-
mate security threat. 
Even though nearly two-thirds of Japanese 
internees were American citizens, Japanese- 
Americans were considered as a collective to 
be disloyal, un-American, and a security risk. 
In 1982, amid a downturn in the U.S. auto-
mobile industry that was blamed on competi-
tion from Japanese companies, Chinese 
American Vincent Chin was beaten to death 
by two white autoworkers, one allegedly say-
ing, ‘‘it’s because of you little m-f-s that we’re 
out of work.’’ 
Chin’s assailants never spent a day in jail 
and instead were only sentenced to probation 
and fined and the resulting outrage from the 
Asian American community served as a gal-
vanizing force to organize for Asian American 
civil rights and advocacy, and it remains a 
central rallying cry and example of injustice for 
contemporary Asian American activism. 
In the aftermath of the September 11th at-
tack on the United States, South Asian, Mus-
lim, and Middle Eastern Americans increas-
ingly became the targets of violence and dis-
crimination. 
In the week following the terrorist attack, 
media outlets reported 645 bias incidents tar-
geting people perceived to be Muslim or of 
Middle Eastern descent. 
At the time, the Bush Administration con-
demned the harassment and urged respect for 
the Muslim and South Asian community, with 
President Bush himself stating that the per-
petrators of these racialized attacks should be 
‘‘ashamed.’’ 
Then-Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
Director Robert Mueller reiterated President 
Bush’s sentiments, stating that: ‘‘vigilante at-
tacks and threats against Arab-Americans will- 
not be tolerated.’’ 
In the years since, the Department of Jus-
tice has investigated over 800 incidents of vio-
lence, threats, and harassment against Arab, 
Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian Americans, 
and others of perceived Middle Eastern de-
scent. 
Sparked by xenophobic rhetoric framing 
fault for the coronavirus around its country of 
origin, Asian Americans, notably those of Chi-
nese descent or assumed Chinese descent, 
have suffered increased rates of violence, har-
assment, and intimidation over the last year. 
Led by the racist rhetoric of the 45th Presi-
dent, targeted xenophobic and anti-Asian sen-
timents have exacerbated the scapegoating 
and targeting of the Asian American commu-
nity. 
Between March 16 and March 30, 2020, the 
worst president in history referred to COVID– 
19 as the ‘‘Chinese virus’’ more than 20 times, 
claiming that his phrasing was not racist at all, 
but rather accurate because the virus came 
from China. 
He even had the word ‘‘Corona’’ crossed 
out of his press conference notes, replaced 
with ‘‘Chinese’’ handwritten above it, and he 
also called the virus ‘‘Kung Flu’’ at a rally in 
Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20, 2020 then again 
at a church rally in Phoenix, Arizona on June 
24, 2020. 
Examples of additional violent physical as-
saults against the Asian American community 
over the last year include:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E548 
May 19, 2021 
1. A sixteen-year-old boy was sent to the 
emergency room after being physically at-
tacked at his high school by an assailant who 
claimed the boy had COVID–19 simply be-
cause he was Asian. 
2. An 81-year-old woman was punched in 
the face and lit on fire outside her home. 
3. A woman was kicked, punched, and hit 
with an umbrella in a subway station in New 
York. 
4. A man and his ten-year-old son were fol-
lowed to a bus station by a man who was 
yelling and cursing at them before eventually 
hitting the man over the head. 
5. A 61-year-old man was slashed across 
the face with a boxcutter on the subway in 
New York City. His injuries required him to re-
ceive nearly 100 stitches. 
6. A woman was doused in a caustic chem-
ical as she took out the trash; resulting in 
chemical burns on her face, neck and back. 
7. A 52-year-old woman was shoved to the 
ground and hit her head on a metal news-
paper stand. 
8. A 51-year-old man was beaten with his 
own cane at a bus stop. His injuries were so 
severe, he lost part of a finger. 
Further, in addition to these violent inci-
dents, data shows that general and daily har-
assment of Asian Americans has increased in 
the last year, examples of which include: 
1. A couple found a note pinned to their 
door that read: ‘‘We’re watching you f—— 
c—— take the chinese virus back to china. 
We don’t want you hear [sic] infecting us with 
your diseases!!!!!!!!!!—Your friendly neighbor-
hood.’’ 
2. A woman was cursed at while taking out 
her trash, a man walking by yelling ‘‘F—— 
Chinese’’ and ‘‘Yea, I’m talking to you, Chi-
nese B——.’’ 
3. A woman was yelled at, followed, and 
spit on as she walked to her gym. 
4. A man was yelled at while grocery shop-
ping, the customer in front of him at the 
checkout line shouting at him ‘‘It’s you people 
who brought the disease.’’ 
Finally, Madam Speaker, in my home state 
of Texas, about this time a year ago, a Bur-
mese American family was shopping at a 
Sam’s Club in Midland, Texas when a man re-
peatedly hit the father on the back of his head 
and slashed at his face. 
Later, the assailant returned to continue to 
attack the family—stabbing their two-year-old 
child and slashing their six-year-old across the 
face. 
In light of increasing attacks on Asian Amer-
icans, several members of Congress have 
called for a stronger hate crime tracking law to 
add to the existing legal framework of hate 
crime legislation. 
Congresswoman CHU, the Chair of the Con-
gressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, 
has called on this consider new hate crime 
tracking legislation, noting that all of us must 
be vocal in rejecting xenophobia and racism.’’ 
And I am pleased to be an original cospon-
sor of the March 25, 2020 resolution intro-
duced by Congresswoman MENG of New York 
and passed by the House on September 17, 
2020, condemning anti-Asian sentiment re-
lated to COVID–19 and calling on federal law 
enforcement officials to work with state and 
local officials to investigate hate crimes and in-
cidents against the Asian American commu-
nity. 
In my hometown of Houston, Texas, we 
know all too well the fear, horror, and heart-
break inflicted on members of vulnerable and 
marginalized communities when they are tar-
geted by hate crime violence. 
That is why I have reintroduced H.R. 133, 
the David Ray Hate Crimes Prevention Act or 
‘‘David’s Law,’’ to amend the federal criminal 
code to impose penalties for willfully causing 
bodily injury to any person or, through the use 
of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, at-
tempting to cause such injury, whether or not 
acting under color of law, because of the ac-
tual or perceived race, color, religion, national 
origin, gender, sexual orientation, or disability 
of any person, where the offense is in or af-
fects interstate or foreign commerce. 
This legislation is named in honor of David 
Ray Ritcheson, a constituent and high school 
student, who was brutally beaten and left for 
dead simply because his assailants hated his 
national origin. 
Madam Speaker, hate crimes are among 
the worst atrocities that exist in modern day 
society. 
A hate crime is defined as the incidence of 
violence motivated by the actual or perceived 
race, color, national origin, relation, sexual ori-
entation, gender, and disability of the victim. 
Unfortunately, 
hate 
crimes 
are 
under-
reported for several reasons, including fear 
and intimidation. 
As most of us in this Congress know all too 
well, hate-motivated violence disrupts the tran-
quility and safety of our communities, impedes 
the movement of members of targeted groups, 
and prevents members of targeted groups 
from purchasing goods and services, obtain-
ing, or sustaining employment, and achieving 
the American Dream. 
The mass shootings in Georgia are one part 
of a nationwide pattern of Asian women’s 
being disproportionately targeted in hate inci-
dents, and this Resolution proclaims loud and 
clear that the United States Government is 
committed to combatting hate, bigotry and vio-
lence against Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers. 
For this reason, I urge all of my colleagues 
to rise with me in support of H. Res. 275— 
Condemning the horrific shootings in Atlanta, 
Georgia, on March 16, 2021, and reaffirming 
the House of Representative’s commitment to 
combating hate, bigotry, and violence against 
the Asian-American and Pacific Islander com-
munity.

A MAN WHO ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO KILL AN 
ASIAN AMERICAN FAMILY BECAUSE OF THE 
CORONAVIRUS
COULD
FACE
HATE
CRIME 
CHARGES 
(By Julia Reinstein) 
The incident is just one in a surge of racist 
attacks that Asian-Americans have faced 
during the coronavirus pandemic. 
A man who allegedly tried to kill an Asian 
American family of three because he be-
lieved they were spreading the coronavirus 
at a Sam’s Club in Texas could face hate 
crime charges, the FBI told BuzzFeed News 
on Wednesday. 
Jose L. Gomez, 19, stabbed the three people 
on March 14 at the Midland, Texas, Sam’s 
Club before being taken down by a store em-
ployee, who saved the family’s lives and was 
injured in the process, police told BuzzFeed 
News. 
Gomez was then taken into custody by an 
off-duty Border Patrol agent. He was charged 
with three counts of attempted capital mur-
der and one count of aggravated assault with 
a deadly weapon. 
Bernie Ramirez, the Border Patrol agent, 
told CBS7 he initially approached Gomez and 
family with the intention of breaking up 
what he thought was a fight over scarce 
goods. 
Ramirez said ‘‘credit is due’’ to Zach Owen, 
the store employee who stopped Gomez by 
putting him in a chokehold and suffered stab 
wounds to the hand in the process. 
‘‘He went into a knife fight bare-handed,’’ 
Ramirez said. ‘‘He took control of the indi-
vidual, and he disarmed him. If Zach had not 
been there, things could’ve gone really 
badly.’’ 
Ramirez did not immediately respond to a 
request for comment. The father in the fam-
ily declined to comment. 
Gomez allegedly stabbed the three ‘‘be-
cause he thought the family was Chinese, 
and infecting people with the coronavirus,’’ 
the FBI stated in a document obtained by 
ABC News. 
An FBI spokesperson told BuzzFeed News 
they were unable to comment on the docu-
ment but confirmed that the case is being 
treated as a possible hate crime, 
According to the FBI report, federal law 
enforcement officials are warning there 
could be a surge in hate crimes against Asian 
Americans. 
‘‘The FBI assesses hate crime incidents 
against Asian Americans likely will surge 
across the United States, due to the spread 
of coronavirus disease . . . endangering 
Asian American communities,’’ the docu-
ment reportedly states. ‘‘The FBI makes this 
assessment based on the assumption that a 
portion of the US public will associate 
COVID–19 with China and Asian American 
populations.’’ 
The Texas stabbing was just one of the 
many racist attacks Asian Americans have 
been facing amid the coronavirus pandemic’s 
rise in the US. 
On March 11, a woman in New York 
punched another woman for not wearing a 
face mask and ‘‘made anti-Asian statements 
and fled the location on foot.’’ In February, 
a 16-year-old boy was sent to the hospital 
after being physically attacked by bullies 
who accused him of having the coronavirus. 
One couple in Minnesota got a note on their 
door that said ‘‘we’re watching you’’ and 
‘‘take the Chinese virus back to China.’’ 
President Donald Trump has deliberately 
referred to COVID–19 as the ‘‘Chinese virus’’ 
on multiple occasions, which critics have 
seen as a way of scapegoating China and, in 
turn, inciting hatred and harassment of peo-
ple of Asian descent. The World Health Orga-
nization has urged people not to attach loca-
tions or ethnicity to the virus to prevent so-
cial stigma. 
When questioned, Trump defended his use 
of the term, 
‘‘It’s not racist at all, no. Not at all,’’ 
Trump said. ‘‘It comes from China.’’ 
The FBI spokesperson told BuzzFeed News 
the agency ‘‘will use all authority granted to 
us by federal law to investigate and hold 
those who commit violent acts accountable 
for their actions.’’ 
‘‘During the COVID–19 pandemic, we want 
to remind everyone that any violent crimi-
nal act against any person because of their 
race, ethnicity or national origin is a hate 
crime,’’ the spokesperson said. ‘‘This in-
cludes violence toward Asian Americans or 
individuals from East Asian countries.’’

8 DEAD IN ATLANTA SPA SHOOTINGS, WITH 
FEARS OF ANTI-ASIAN BIAS 
The man who police say went on a rampage 
at three spas in the Atlanta area has been 
charged with eight counts of murder in co 
nection with the attacks.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E549 
May 19, 2021 
Here’s what we know: 
1. The suspect in the spa attacks has been 
charged with eight counts of murder. 
2. Six of the eight victims were women of 
Asian descent. 
3. President Biden: ‘I know Asian-Ameri-
cans are very concerned.’ 
4. A survivor of the shooting spree called 
his wife: ‘I’ve been shot! Please come.’ 
5. The suspect’s parents identified him in 
surveillance footage during the manhunt. 
6. Experts warn of a rise in hate crimes 
motivated by ‘male supremacy.’ 
7. Asian-Americans were targeted in nearly 
3,800 hate incidents in the past year. 
The Atlanta police on Wednesday said a 21- 
year-old suspect was arrested and charged in 
the shootings that took place at three mas-
sage parlors Tuesday night: 
‘‘This was a tragic day with many victims, 
but thankfully the suspect was quickly ap-
prehended.’’ ‘‘The suspect did take responsi-
bility for the shootings. He said that early 
on, once we began the interviews with him. 
He claims that these, and as the chief said, 
we know this is still early, but he does claim 
that it was not racially motivated. He appar-
ently has an issue, what he considers a sex 
addiction, and sees these locations as some-
thing that allows him to go to these places. 
And it is a temptation for him that he want-
ed to eliminate.’’ ‘‘So obviously, whatever 
the motivation was for this guy, we know 
that many of the victims, the majority of 
the victims, were Asian. We also know that 
this is an issue that is happening across the 
country. It is unacceptable. It is hateful, and 
it has to stop.’’ ‘‘We put out an image of a 
possible suspect very early on in this inci-
dent, and we were notified by his family, who 
were fully cooperative, and we are greatly 
appreciative of their assistance in this mat-
ter.’’ 
ACWORTH, Ga.—The man who police say 
went on a rampage at three spas in the At-
lanta area, killing eight people, was charged 
on Wednesday with eight counts of murder in 
connection with the attacks. 
The brazen shootings, which took the lives 
of six women of Asian descent, stirred con-
siderable outrage and fear in the Asian- 
American community. Investigators said 
they had not ruled out bias as a motivating 
factor even as the suspect denied such racial 
animus once in custody. 
The gunman told the police: that he had a 
‘‘sexual addiction’’ and had carried out the 
shootings at the massage parlors to elimi-
nate his ‘‘temptation,’’ the authorities said 
on Wednesday. He also said that he had fre-
quented massage parlors in the past and 
launched the attacks as a form of vengeance. 
All but one of the victims were women, the 
police said. 
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta 
said that regardless of the determination 
about motive, the tragedy was clear. 
‘‘Whatever the motivation was for this 
guy, we know that the majority of the vic-
tims were Asian,’’ Ms. Bottoms said. ‘‘We 
also know that this is an issue that is hap-
pening across the country. It is unaccept-
able, it is hateful and it has to stop.’’ 
The authorities charged Robert Aaron 
Long, 21, on Wednesday with eight counts of 
murder and one count of aggravated assault 
in connection with the shootings. Four of 
the murder counts and the assault charge 
stem from the first shooting, in Cherokee 
County, and the other four murder counts re-
late to the shootings at two spas in the city 
of Atlanta less than an hour later, the au-
thorities said. 
Capt. Jay Baker of the Cherokee County 
Sheriffs Office said the gunman had told the 
police he was driving to Florida when he was 
caught after the shootings on Tuesday 
evening, and that he said he may have been 
trying to commit similar violence at a busi-
ness connected to the ‘‘porn industry’’ there. 
He was stopped after his parents alerted the 
police that they believed their son might be 
the suspect, and the police were able to 
track his phone. 
Sheriff Frank Reynolds of Cherokee Coun-
ty said the gunman may have ‘‘frequented 
these places in the past and may have been 
lashing out.’’ 
The police arrested Mr. Long, who is white, 
about 150 miles south of Atlanta after a man-
hunt, the authorities said. They had earlier 
released a surveillance image of a suspect 
near a Hyundai Tucson outside one of the 
massage parlors. Mr. Baker said that Mr. 
Long, of Cherokee County, had admitted to 
the shootings and that he appeared to be act-
ing alone. 
Rodney Bryant, the acting chief of the At-
lanta Police Department, said it was not yet 
clear whether the shooting spree would be 
classified as a hate crime. 
‘‘We are still early in this investigation, so 
we cannot make that determination at this 
moment,’’ Chief Bryant said. ‘‘We are just 
not there as of yet.’’ 
(By Scott Reinhard) 
Four people died in the first shooting, at 
Young’s Asian Massage near Acworth, a 
northwest suburb of Atlanta, Mr. Baker said. 
That shooting, in which a Hispanic man was 
injured, was reported around 5 p.m. 
At 5:47 p.m., the Atlanta police said, offi-
cers responded to a robbery at Gold Spa in 
the northeast part of the city, where they 
found the bodies.of three women with gun-
shot wounds. While the officers were at the 
scene, the police said, they received a report 
of shots fired at the Aromatherapy Spa 
across the street, where they found the body 
of another woman. 
A 911 caller who said she was hiding in the 
back of Gold Spa told the emergency oper-
ator that a ‘‘white guy’’ had a gun, according 
to audio recordings released by the Atlanta 
Police Department. 
She was not sure where the gunman was, 
she told the operator, because she was hid-
ing, and was unsure what he was wearing. ‘‘I 
don’t know,’’ she pleaded in response to 
questions. ‘‘Please just come.’’ 
Six of the eight people killed in the shoot-
ings at Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday were 
women of Asian descent, raising fears that 
they could have been targeted because of 
their race, even as the police said it was too 
early to know. 
On Wednesday, the police named the vic-
tims of the shooting at Young’s Asian Mas-
sage in Acworth, Ga., as Delaina Ashley 
Yaun; 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, 
of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49, of Kennesaw; and 
Daoyou Feng, 44. One person, Elcias R. Her-
nandez-Ortiz, 30, of Acworth, was injured. 
An official from the South Korean Con-
sulate in Atlanta, citing the Foreign Min-
istry in Seoul, confirmed on Wednesday that 
four of the eight killed in the shooting spree 
were ethnic Koreans. But the nationalities of 
the four women were not immediately 
known, the official said. 
Ms. Yaun was a customer at Young’s Asian 
Massage and had been planning a date night 
with her husband, her half sister, Dana 
Toole, said. She was killed, and her husband 
survived after locking himself in a nearby 
room as gunshots rang out, Ms. Toole said. 
‘‘He’s not OK,’’ Ms. Toole said about her 
sister’s husband. ‘‘He’s taking it hard.’’ 
Ms. Yaun was one of four siblings who grew 
up in Acworth, and had worked as a server at 
a Waffle House restaurant. She raised a 13- 
year-old son as a single mother and had an 8- 
month-old daughter, Ms. Toole said. 
‘‘It was just all about family,’’ Ms. Toole 
said. ‘‘Whatever we’d do, we’d do it to-
gether.’’ Now the shooting has left the fam-
ily in shock. 
‘‘It doesn’t seem real. I expect to see her 
walking through the door any minute. It just 
hasn’t quite sunk in yet,’’ Ms. Toole said. 
‘‘My eyes hurt so bad because I’ve been 
crying so much,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s just hard 
right now for us to even think about moving 
forward, because she’s not here.’’ 
Young’s Asian Massage is tucked in a mod-
est strip mall, with a beauty salon on one 
side and a boutique on the other. Like much 
of suburban Georgia, the mall is a diverse 
place, with panaderias and Latin businesses 
and American-style chain restaurants. 
On Tuesday night, the blue lights of police 
vehicles cast an eerie glow as detectives 
worked inside the spa. 
Rita Barron, 47, the owner of Gabby’s Bou-
tique next door, was with a group of onlook-
ers standing near a used car lot. She said she 
had been with a customer when she heard 
noises through the wall that sounded like 
claps—and then women screaming. 
She called 911, and soon saw victims being 
taken out by police officers. 
Nearby, a wail of anguish went up from an-
other cluster of people waiting for any news. 
Three dropped to the pavement, two of them 
embracing and shaking as they cried.

CELEBRATING 
HARVEY 
SOLWAY 
ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 70TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 70th birthday of Mr. 
Harvey Solway of Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, 
who reached this milestone on March 24th. 
Harvey has spent his long and loving life 
dedicated to his beloved family and countless 
friends. He has maintained a vibrant career as 
the successful Chief Executive Officer of Pet 
Supplies Plus, and now investment enter-
prises. 
Harvey’s family encouraged friends around 
the country to write to him and share a favor-
ite memory, and I would like to include mine 
here for this record. 
It is well known that the first time I met Har-
vey Solway was when I was in high school, 
and I entered his house after school with his 
daughter, Alison, one of my best friends, I 
mistakenly thought he was asking me how my 
day went, when in fact, he was speaking to 
his wife. My precocious seventeen-year-old 
self responded that I was exasperated to find 
out that a government education program for 
young adults had concluded its application pe-
riod, and that I had missed the deadline. 
While Alison regales many with this story 
frequently, what many do not know is that 
Harvey Solway was one of the first people to 
encourage and support my run for Congress. 
Harvey has lent generous wisdom and 
counsel to many aspiring young professionals. 
He does so without seeking credit or attention, 
but because he likes to contribute to the better 
outcomes of those around him. Today, I am 
pleased to celebrate my friend, Harvey, on his 
birthday. I am glad that he got to spend this 
milestone day with his loving wife, Nancy, by 
his side. Here’s to many more.

IN SUPPORT OF H. RES. 398 REC-

THE 
FORTHCOMING 
CENTENNIAL OF THE 1921 TULSA 
RACE MASSACRE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to speak in strong support of H. Res. 398, the 
Recognizing the Forthcoming Centennial of 
the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, recognizes 
one of the darkest moments in American his-
tory, the Tulsa-Greenwood Race Massacre, 
that occurred in the African American Green-
wood community of Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 
31–June 1, 1921. 
Madam Speaker, earlier this year I intro-
duced a resolution (H. Res. 215 later modified 
as H. Res. 398), joined by 84 cosponsors, rec-
ognizing the centennial of the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre. 
The resolution was reintroduced as H. Res. 
398 to make technical corrections to allow the 
House of Representatives to vote on the 
measure. 
On March 18, 2021, I am pleased to report 
that the H. Res. 398 passed the House as 
part of the House Rule for H.R. 1629, the Fair-
ness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act, and H. 
Res. 275, the Condemning the horrific shoot-
ings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021. 
As the great southern writer William Faulk-
ner reminded us: ‘‘The past is never dead. It’s 
not even past.’’ 
Madam Speaker, as I and other Members 
spoke in support of H. Res. 398, we recounted 
the hatreds, prejudices, resentments, and 
white supremacy that Black Americans wit-
nessed and suffered in Greenwood a century 
ago are not dead; they are not even past.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E551 
May 19, 2021 
A century ago, White rioters, local law en-
forcement, 
and 
self-appointed 
vigilantes 
claimed to be acting reasonably and in self- 
defense against what they feared was an up-
coming Black uprising. 
They resented the economic prosperity and 
self-sufficiency of the Greenwood community, 
which was known nationally as ‘‘Black Wall 
Street.’’ 
They viewed Black males as fearsome 
physical threats to their personal safety and as 
rivals to white women. 
These baseless, irrational concerns are not 
a relic of the past, they are with us today and 
are what resulted in the deaths of George 
Floyd, Tamir Rice, Deonte Wright, Stephon 
Clark, Amidou Diallo, and hundreds of others 
too numerous to list. 
In 1921, Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood Dis-
trict, known as ‘‘Black Wall Street,’’ was one of 
the most documented prosperous African 
American communities in the United States. 
The Greenwood community with a popu-
lation of over 100,000 Black people had stores 
that sold luxury items, 21 restaurants, 30 gro-
cery stores, a hospital, a savings and loan 
bank, a post office, three hotels, jewelry and 
clothing stores, two movie theaters, a library, 
pool halls, a bus and cab service, a nationally 
recognized school system, six private air-
planes, and two black newspapers. 
On May 31st of that year, the 35 city blocks 
of Greenwood went up in flames, at least 300 
Black persons were murdered and more than 
800 were injured; it is estimated that not less 
than 9,000 were left homeless and destitute. 
These rioters reenacted the brutality of the 
mob from a hundred years ago in the hal-
lowed halls of the Citadel of Democracy. 
It should not be overlooked that the source 
of their irrational anger, hatred, and violent re-
action was that Black Americans voted in 
overwhelming numbers in the Atlanta, Phila-
delphia, Milwaukee, and Detroit to oust the 
most negative, divisive, racially hostile, and in-
competent presidents history, the 45th Presi-
dent, who presided over the deaths of more 
than 500,000 Americans, disproportionately 
Black and Brown. 
The legacy of white mob violence inflicted 
upon the Black community of Greenwood has 
scarred the descendants of the victims of this 
American pogrom. 
Madam Speaker, the events of January 6th 
have given us insight into what the people of 
Greenwood Oklahoma faced when they were 
attacked by a similar murderous mob. 
H. Res. 98 is a reminder to the nation of the 
ultimate cruelty inflicted upon a people for 
dare believing that the promise of America 
was attainable by them and their achieve-
ments would be respected and protected by 
law. 
But it does more than that, it puts the House 
of Representatives on record that the United 
States can achieve a more perfect union: 
by condemning the violence and destruction 
perpetrated against the African-American com-
munity of Greenwood, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the 
scene of the then-largest single instance of 
domestic terror against American citizens; 
through the rejection and active opposition 
to the false ideology of White supremacy and 
condemnation of all groups and organizations 
that ascribe to this false system of belief and 
seek to perpetuate their views through vio-
lence and unlawful conduct; 
by promoting tolerance and unity and taking 
actions to ensure that governmental policies 
and actions do not foster division, disharmony, 
or intolerance; 
by calling upon all Americans to celebrate 
the ethnic, racial, and religious diversity that 
has made the United States the leader of the 
community of nations and the beacon of hope 
and inspiration to oppressed persons every-
where; 
encouraging all persons in the United States 
to reflect upon the history of the United States 
as an imperfect but committed journey to es-
tablish a more perfect union and to cherish 
and exercise the rights, privileges, and re-
sponsibilities guaranteed by the Constitution; 
and 
recognizing the commitment of Congress to 
acknowledge and. learn from the history of 
racism and racial violence in the United 
States, including the Tulsa Race Massacre, to 
reverse the legacy of White supremacy and 
fight for racial justice. 
Madam Speaker, I will now briefly recount 
the horrific events cited in H. Res. 398 that 
were experienced by the law-abiding Black 
community of Greenwood on those terrible 
days. 
In 1921, White supremacy and racist vio-
lence were common throughout the United 
States and went largely unchecked by the jus-
tice system. 
In Tulsa, Oklahoma reports of an alleged 
and disputed incident on the morning of May 
30, 1921, between two teenagers, a Black 
man and a White woman, caused the White 
community of Tulsa, including the Tulsa Trib-
une, to call for a lynching amidst a climate of 
White racial hostility and White resentment 
over Black economic success. 
On May 31, 1921, a mob of armed White 
men descended upon Tulsa’s Greenwood Dis-
trict and launched what is now known as the 
‘‘Tulsa Race Massacre.’’ 
Tulsa municipal and county authorities failed 
to take actions to calm or contain the violence, 
and civil and law enforcement officials depu-
tized many White men who were participants 
in the violence as their agents, directly contrib-
uting to the violence through overt and often 
illegal acts. 
Over a period of 24 hours, the White mob’s 
violence led to the death of an estimated 300 
Black residents, as well as over 800 reports of 
injuries. 
The White mob looted, damaged, burned, or 
otherwise destroyed approximately 40 square 
blocks of the Greenwood district, including an 
estimated 1,256 homes of Black residents, as 
well as virtually every other structure, including 
churches, schools, businesses, a hospital, and 
a library, leaving nearly 9,000 Black residents 
of the Greenwood community homeless and 
effectively wiping out tens of millions dollars in 
Black prosperity and wealth. 
In the wake of the Tulsa Race Massacre, 
the Governor of Oklahoma declared martial 
law, and units of the Oklahoma National 
Guard participated in the mass arrests of all or 
nearly all of Greenwood’s surviving residents, 
removing them from Greenwood to other parts 
of Tulsa and unlawfully detaining them in hold-
ing centers. 
Oklahoma local and state governments dis-
missed claims arising from it the 1921 Tulsa 
Race Massacre for decades, and the event 
was effectively erased from collective memory 
and history until, in 1997, the Oklahoma State 
Legislature finally created a commission to 
study the event. 
On February 28, 2001, the commission 
issued a report that detailed, for the first time, 
the extent of the Massacre and decades-long 
efforts to suppress its recollection. 
None of the law enforcement officials nor 
any of the hundreds of other White mob mem-
bers who participated in the violence were 
ever prosecuted or held accountable for the 
hundreds of lives lost and tens of millions of 
dollars of Black wealth destroyed, despite the 
Tulsa Race Massacre Commission confirming 
their roles in the Massacre, nor was any com-
pensation ever provided to the Massacre’s vic-
tims or their descendants. 
Government and city officials not only abdi-
cated their responsibility to rebuild and repair 
the Greenwood community in the wake of the 
violence, but actively blocked efforts to do so, 
contributing to continued racial disparities in 
Tulsa akin to those that Black people still face 
today across the United States. 
Madam Speaker, the pattern of violence 
against Black people in the United States, 
often at the hands of law enforcement, shows 
that the fight to end State-sanctioned violence 
against Black people continues. 
As the American Historical Association stat-
ed, ‘‘What happened in Tulsa was extreme, 
but not unusual. It is part of our Nation’s herit-
age. We must acknowledge that heritage, 
learn from it, and do whatever each of us can 
do to ensure that it is just that—heritage, rath-
er than a continuing practice.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD a 
more detailed account of the 1921 Tulsa Race 
Massacre that is based on the ‘‘Final Report 
of the Oklahoma Commission to Study The 
Tulsa Race Riot of 1921,’’ issued February 28, 
2001. 
Madam Speaker, I also ask the House to 
observe a moment of silence in memory of the 
victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre, and their descendants to carry the ter-
rible memories of that horrific day and still 
grieve over the loss of so many loved ones 
and of faith in the American system of justice. 
MOTHER
RANDLE’S
WRITTEN
TESTIMONY
FOR 
THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITU-
TION, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, MAY 
19, 2021 
I am blessed and honored to be talking 
with you today. It means a lot to me to fi-
nally be able to look at you all in the eye 
and ask you to do the right thing. I have 
waited so long for justice. 
My name is Lessie Evelyn Benningfield 
Randle. People call me Mother Randle. 
Today, I am 106-years-old. 100 years ago, in 
1921, I was a 6-year-old child. I was blessed to 
live with my grandmother in a beautiful 
Black community in Tulsa Oklahoma, called 
Greenwood. I was lucky. I had a home. I had 
toys. I didn’t have any fears as a young child 
and I felt very safe. My community was 
beautiful and was filled with happy and suc-
cessful 
Black 
people. 
Then 
everything 
changed. 
It was like a war. White men with guns 
came and destroyed my community. We 
couldn’t understand why. What did we do to 
them? We didn’t understand. We were just 
living. But they came, and they destroyed 
everything. 
They burned houses and businesses. They 
just took what they wanted out of the build-
ings then they burned them. They murdered 
people. We were told they just dumped the 
dead bodies into the river. I remember run-
ning outside of our house. I ran past dead 
bodies. It wasn’t a pretty sight. I still see it 
today in my mind—100 years later.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E552 
May 19, 2021 
I was so scared—I didn’t think we would 
make it out alive. I remember people were 
running everywhere. We waited for the sol-
diers to come, and when they finally came, 
they took us to the fairgrounds where we 
would be safe. It felt like so long before they 
came. 
I survived the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. 
And I have survived 100 years of painful 
memories and losses. 
By the grace of God, I am still here. I have 
survived. I have survived to tell this story. I 
believe that I am still here to share it with 
you. Hopefully now, you all will listen to us. 
While we are still here. 
The white people who did this to us, were 
filled with so much hate. It is disgusting 
that they hate us for no reason except that 
we are Black people. 
We know—most of the people who com-
mitted these acts are dead now. The three of 
us here today, are the only ones left—that 
we know of. But just because these men are 
probably dead, the City and County of Tulsa, 
the State of Oklahoma, and the Tulsa Cham-
ber are still responsible for making it right. 
The City and County caused this to happen 
to us— 
The State allowed this happen to us—they 
didn’t protect us. 
The Chamber helped ensure that we could 
not rebuild after the Massacre, including 
holding us in internment camps. 
They owe us something. They owe me 
something. I have lived much of my life poor. 
My opportunities were taken from me. And 
my community, North Tulsa—Black Tulsa— 
is still messed up today. They didn’t rebuild 
it. Its empty. It’s a ghetto. You can help us 
get some justice. 
America is full of examples where people in 
positions of power, many just like you, have 
told us to wait. Others have told us it’s too 
late. It seems like justice in America is al-
ways so slow or not possible for Blacks. And 
we are made to feel crazy just for asking for 
things to be made right. There are always so 
many excuses for why justice is so slow or 
never happens at all. 
I am here today, at 106-years-old, looking 
at you all in the eye. We’ve waited too long, 
and I am tired. We are tired. I am asking you 
today to give us some peace. Please give me, 
my family, and my community some justice. 
Thank you. 
HUGHES
VAN
ELLIS
WRITTEN
TESTIMONY
FOR 
THE HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITU-
TION, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES, MAY 
19, 2021 
My name is Hughes Van Ellis. I am 100 
years old. And I am a survivor of the Tulsa 
Race Massacre. Because of the Massacre, my 
family was driven from our home. We were 
left with nothing. We were made refugees in 
our own country. 
My childhood was hard and we didn’t have 
much. We worried what little we had would 
be stolen from us. Just like it was stolen in 
Tulsa. You may have been taught that when 
something is stolen from you, you can go to 
the courts to be made whole. You can go to 
the courts to get justice. This wasn’t the 
case 
for 
us. 
The 
courts 
in 
Oklahoma 
wouldn’t hear us. The federal courts said we 
were too late. 
We were made to feel that our struggles 
were unworthy of justice. That we were less 
valued than whites, that we weren’t fully 
American. We were shown that in the United 
States, not all men were equal under law. We 
were shown that when Black voices called 
out for justice, no one cared. 
But we still had faith things would get bet-
ter. We still believed in the promise of Amer-
ica and in the cause of freedom. 
I did my duty in World War II. I served in 
combat in the Far East with the 234th AAA 
Gun Battalion. We were an all-black bat-
talion. I fought for freedom abroad, even 
though it was ripped away from me at home, 
even after my home and my community were 
destroyed, I did it because I believed, in the 
end, America would get it right. 
When I returned home from the war, I 
didn’t find any of the freedom I was fighting 
for overseas. Unlike white servicemen, I 
wasn’t entitled to GI Bill benefits because of 
the color of my skin. I came home to seg-
regation. A separate and unequal America. 
But still I believed in America, 
This is why we are still speaking up today, 
even at the age of 100. The Tulsa Race Mas-
sacre isn’t a footnote in a history book for 
us. We live with it every day and the thought 
of what Greenwood was and what it could 
have been. We aren’t just black and white 
pictures on a screen, we are flesh and blood. 
I was there when it happened, I’m still here. 
My sister was there when it happened, she’s 
still here. 
We’re not asking for a handout. All we are 
asking for is for a chance to be treated like 
a first-class citizen who truly is a bene-
ficiary of the promise that this is a land 
where there is ‘‘liberty and justice for all.’’ 
We are asking for justice for a lifetime of 
ongoing harm. Harm that was caused by the 
Massacre. You can give us the chance to be 
heard and give us a chance to be made whole 
after all these years and after all our strug-
gle. 
I still believe in America. I still believe in 
the ideals that I fought overseas to defend. 
And I believe if given the chance you will do 
the right thing and justice will be served. 
Thank you. 
WRITTEN TESTIMONY OF MOTHER VIOLA FLETCH-
ER FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE CONSTITU-
TION, CIVIL
RIGHTS, AND
CIVIL
LIBERTIES, 
WEDNESDAY, MAY 19, 2021 
My name is Viola Fletcher, or Mother 
Fletcher. I am the daughter of Lucinda Ellis 
and John Wesley Ford of Tulsa, Oklahoma. I 
am the sister of Hughes Van Ellis, who is 
also here today. And I am a survivor of the 
Tulsa Race Massacre. Two weeks ago, I cele-
brated my 107th birthday. 
Today, I am in Washington, D.C. for the 
first time in my life. I am here seeking jus-
tice. I am here asking my country to ac-
knowledge what happened in Tulsa in 1921. 
On May 31st 1921, I went to bed in my fam-
ily’s home in the Greenwood neighborhood of 
Tulsa. The neighborhood I feel asleep in that 
night was rich—not just in terms of wealth, 
but in culture, community, and heritage. My 
family had a beautiful home. We had great 
neighbors and I had friends to play with. I 
felt safe. I had everything a child could need. 
I had a bright future ahead of me. Greenwood 
could have given me the chance to truly 
make it in this country. 
Within a few hours, all of that was gone. 
The night of the Massacre I was woken up by 
my family. My parents and five siblings were 
there. I was told we had to leave. And that 
was it. 
I will never forget the violence of the white 
mob when we left our house. I still see Black 
men being shot, and Black bodies lying in 
the street. I still smell smoke and see fire. I 
still see Black businesses being burned. I 
still hear airplanes flying overhead. I hear 
the screams. I live through the Massacre 
every day. 
Our country may forget this history. I can-
not. I will not. The other survivors do not. 
And our descendants do not. 
When my family was forced to leave Tulsa, 
I lost my chance at an education. I never fin-
ished school past the fourth grade. I have 
never made much money. My country, state, 
and city took a lot from me. Despite this, I 
spent time supporting the war effort in the 
shipyards of California. But for most of my 
life, I was a domestic worker serving white 
families. I never made much money. To this 
day, I can barely afford my everyday needs. 
All the while the City of Tulsa have unjustly 
used the names and stories of victims like 
me to enrich itself and its White allies 
through the $30 million raised by the Tulsa 
Centennial Commission while I continue to 
live in poverty. 
I am 107 years old and have never seen jus-
tice. I pray that one day I will. I have been 
blessed with a long life—and have seen the 
best and worst of this country. I think about 
the horrors inflicted upon Black people in 
this country every day. 
This Subcommittee has the power to lead 
us down a better path. I am asking that my 
country acknowledge what has happened to 
me. The trauma. The pain. The loss. And I 
ask that survivors and descendants be given 
a chance to seek justice. Open the courtroom 
doors to us. 
I believe we must acknowledge America’s 
sins. It is the least we can do. 
I saw what happened here on January 6th 
this year. It broke my heart. It reminded me 
of what happened 100 years ago. And now, I 
hear some of you on TV saying it didn’t hap-
pen, like we didn’t see it with our own eyes. 
It happened on live TV. 100 years ago, there 
was no TV, but you have me here right now. 
You see Mother Randle. You see my brother, 
Hughes Van Ellis. We lived this history. We 
can’t ignore it. It lives with us. 
We lost everything that day. Our homes. 
Our churches. Our newspapers. Our theaters. 
Our lives. Greenwood represented the best of 
what was possible for Black people in Amer-
ica—and for all people. No one cared about 
us for almost 100 years. We, and our history, 
have been forgotten, washed away. This Con-
gress must recognize us, and our history. For 
Black Americans. For white Americans. For 
all Americans. That’s some justice. 
Thank you.

HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Louie 
Martin for his 10 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children. Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Martin has worked throughout his 
career to serve the people of Somerset Coun-
ty. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank him for his work to pro-
tect life and property in our community and 
wish him continued health, safety, and suc-
cess.

THE TRAGEDY OF THE TULSA 
GREENWOOD MASSACRE 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BONNIE WATSON COLEMAN 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, May 17, 2021 
Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize the 100th Com-
memoration of the Tulsa-Greenwood Race 
Massacre, where on May 31–June 1, 1921, a 
white mob of thousands of people shot and 
murdered Black residents of America’s ‘‘Black 
Wall Street’’ in Tulsa, Oklahoma, looted their 
homes and businesses, and burned more than 
a thousand homes, churches, schools, and 
businesses. The horrific events of this deadly 
attack were the result of a series of failures of 
leadership that ultimately fostered race-based 
violence, discrimination, and oppression. 
This was a failure of law enforcement to 
protect Tulsa’s Black residents and maintain 
civil order. A failure of the judicial system, as 
many of the residents who fled the Massacre 
were detained in internment camps imme-
diately following the Massacre and a grand 
jury placed the blame entirely on the Black 
community and indicted 85 people—mostly Af-
rican Americans—with Massacre-related of-
fenses. A failure of our American promises of 
the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness. Justice was not served. 
No White person was ever held individually 
accountable for crimes committed during the 
Massacre, and the vast majority of survivors 
and their descendants were never directly 
compensated for these harms. 
The attack on the thriving Black community 
continued on throughout the years and is evi-
dent even in today’s society; as the commu-
nity sustained millions of dollars of property 
damage and many Black survivors of the 
Tulsa massacre and their descendants have 
not been able to recoup the wealth that had 
been stolen or destroyed during the Massacre. 
And still today, despite calls for justice and ac-
countability, our government leaders continue 
to fail the victims of the Tulsa-Greenwood 
Massacre and their descendants by refusing 
action to right the wrongs that were per-
petrated on innocent community members 100 
years ago. Over the decades, local ordinances 
to prevent rebuilding, redlining, and so-called 
‘‘urban renewal’’ policies have prevented Black 
Tulsans from rebuilding a thriving community. 
Expressways, funded by the federal govern-
ment, literally cut through areas of Green-
wood, displacing Black families and busi-
nesses. 
Madam Speaker, though we are 100 years 
past the heinous Tulsa-Greenwood Massacre, 
Black Americans are unfortunately not far re-
moved from the continued injustice of sys-
temic racism and oppressive tactics that block 
upward mobility out of poverty and suppress 
opportunities 
to 
create 
and 
maintain 
generational wealth. As we take time to recall 
the injustice of this Massacre and continue the 
call for justice for the descendants, let us also 
reflect on the continued efforts of injustice that 
plague minority communities today. We need 
accountability, we need economic justice, and 
we need criminal justice reform. We cannot 
continue to delay justice and equality. The 
time for change is now. 
HONORING 
DOCTOR 
STEPHEN 
PLYMATE AS THE RECIPIENT OF 
THE 2020 WILLIAM S. MIDDLETON 
AWARD 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Doctor Stephen Plymate 
on being the 2020 recipient of the William S. 
Middleton Award for outstanding scientific con-
tributions and achievements in the areas of 
biomedical and bio-behavioral research rel-
evant to the healthcare of Veterans. This pres-
tigious award is the highest honor given by the 
Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Biomedical 
Laboratory Research and Development Serv-
ice. 
Doctor Plymate, a veteran himself, is an 
endocrinologist at the VA Puget Sound Health 
Care System and associate director of the 
Geriatric Research Education and Clinical 
Center. He is credited with scientific break-
throughs that identified the biological mecha-
nism underlying lethal, castration-resistant 
prostate cancer. Prostate cancer cells can be-
come resistant to a common form of treatment 
and Doctor Plymate’s discovery identified why 
traditional therapies have failed and spurred 
innovation for newer, potentially more effective 
therapies. 
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diag-
nosed cancer among Veterans, and over 
500,000 known Veterans are currently battling 
this disease. Doctor Plymate’s research will 
save the lives of countless Veterans and civil-
ians alike. Once again, the Puget Sound VA 
has recruited the brightest and produced re-
search that will revolutionize medicine. 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to recog-
nize 
Doctor 
Stephen 
Plymate’s 
on 
his 
groundbreaking research and being the well- 
deserved recipient of the 2020 Middleton 
Award.

ANTONIO ESQUIBEL 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Antonio Esquibel, a 
Northglenn, Colo. City Councilmember, former 
Mayor, a Vietnam Veteran, and a great Colo-
radan. 
Mr. Esquibel has been a resident and a sta-
ple in the Northglenn community for more than 
a decade, during which time he has dedicated 
much of his time and energy into serving his 
community and fellow neighbors. Throughout 
his tenure serving the City of Northglenn, Mr. 
Esquibel has held numerous positions in city 
government, including Mayor, Mayor Pro Tem, 
City 
Councilmember, 
Finance 
Committee 
member, and Adams County 12 School Board 
liaison. Mr. Esquibel was first elected to the 
City Council in 2015 where he served as the 
Ward 4 representative before being appointed 
to Mayor Pro Tem in 2017. He was then ap-
pointed Mayor in June of 2019 and proceeded 
to serve out the term before returning to his 
role as a Councilmember. As Councilmember 
and Mayor, he has been a strong advocate 
and champion for education and mental health 
issues. 
Mr. Esquibel’s dedication to the Northglenn 
community follows a lifetime of public service 
in which he worked as a counselor in Adams 
12 Five Star Schools and served our nation in 
the Army during the Vietnam War. Mr. 
Esquibel served in the U.S. Army from 1968 to 
1974, ending his service with the rank of Ser-
geant. His service included time in Okinawa 
where he was awarded the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Meritorious Unit Com-
mendation and the Good Conduct Medal (1st 
and 2nd Awards). His primary specialty was 
as a military police officer and secondary spe-
cialty was with the 11th Bravo Company as a 
Light Weapons Infantryman. In addition to his 
service to Northglenn and to our country, Mr. 
Esquibel is a loving husband to Dr. Deborah 
Esquibel Hunt and is a devoted father and 
grandfather. 
While our state has been blessed with capa-
ble leadership throughout its history, few rise 
to the caliber and reputation of Mr. Esquibel. 
I wish Antonio Esquibel all the best in retire-
ment and send gratitude for his service to the 
Northglenn community, the great State of Col-
orado, and the United States of America.

HONORING SISTER PEG SPINDLER 
HON. FRANK J. MRVAN 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. MRVAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I take this 
time to honor Sister Peg Spindler and to wish 
her well upon her retirement. For her lifetime 
of service and her dedication to Sojourner 
Truth House, Sister Peg is to be highly com-
mended. After more than twenty-four years of 
service, Sister Peg will be retiring on July 1, 
2021, as the executive director of the women’s 
shelter. 
Sister Peg found her calling to sisterhood at 
a young age while growing up in Cedar Lake, 
Indiana. Upon graduating from Andrean High 
School in 1966, she became a religious sister 
and earned her bachelor’s degree from Alver-
nia College in Reading, Pennsylvania. Sister 
Peg then embarked on her career as an edu-
cator, where she taught junior high school stu-
dents in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsyl-
vania. In 1983, after returning home, Sister 
Peg earned a master’s degree from Villanova 
University and another in pastoral studies from 
Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, Illinois. 
Sister Peg later went on to teach eighth grad-
ers at Holy Trinity School in Gary, Indiana, for 
fifteen years. 
In November 1997, Sister Peg, along with 
the support of the Poor Handmaids of Jesus 
Christ, opened the doors to Sojourner Truth 
House, located in Gary, Indiana. Sojourner 
Truth House serves homeless, underserved, 
and at-risk women and their children with the 
goal of providing them the necessary tools 
and resources to improve their quality of life. 
After retiring, Sister Peg plans to continue 
advocating for the homeless in our region 
through the Continuum of Care Network of 
Northwest Indiana and is hopeful she will be 
able to launch the first Lake County Homeless 
Trust Fund. She also plans to visit Catholic 
parishes throughout the country to advocate 
on best practices to reduce carbon dioxide 
emissions and combat the harmful effects of 
climate change on those most vulnerable. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
honoring Sister Peg Spindler for her out-
standing service to the women and children 
who have passed through Sojourner Truth 
House and to wish her well upon her retire-
ment. For her lifetime of leadership and tire-
less dedication to her community, Sister Peg 
is worthy of our utmost gratitude and apprecia-
tion.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE HERIT-
AGE BAPTIST CHURCH 40TH AN-
NIVERSARY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and congratulate Heritage 
Baptist Church in Woodbridge, Virginia as it 
celebrates its 40 years of Christian: service. 
In 1981 the Heritage Baptist church was 
founded in a modest rental facility at Potomac 
Highschool. While small in numbers, this did 
not deter the church from making an impact 
on the community and spreading the word of 
God. To date, the Heritage Baptist Church has 
facilitated 
over 
190 
worldwide 
missions, 
boasts a congregation of over 500 members, 
and has planted 6 churches across the nation. 
In the last 40 years, the congregation has 
continued to flourish and grow. What began as 
a small group in a one-room church has 
evolved into a 17 acres campus that has 
touched the lives of and inspired hundreds of 
individuals. 
Today the Heritage Church can reach mem-
bers of the community through the various 
programs offered, such as a K4 to a twelfth- 
grade Christian school, Sunday school bus 
outreach, the Heritage Institute of Ministry, 
and sermons in Spanish. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me in support of the Heritage Baptist 
Church 40th anniversary. May God bless the 
Heritage Baptist Church and its community 
and may He continue to work through it to 
continue to spread the Word of God.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER JESSE 
SMILEY 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Jesse 
Smiley for his 15 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children, Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Smiley has worked throughout 
his career to serve the people of Somerset 
County. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th 
Congressional District, I thank him for his work 
to protect life and property in our community 
and wish him continued health, safety, and 
success.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF MRS. CHARLOTTE HODDER 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to recognize Mrs. Charlotte 
Hodder on her retirement from the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services, where she was 
hired as a nurse consultant on February 5, 
1995. 
Mrs. Hodder is a veteran of the United 
States Army, where she was a Specialist-E–4 
from August 25, 1975 to January 22, 1980. 
Mrs. Hodder was in the Women’s Army Corps, 
which in 1978 merged into the U..S. Army. 
They were the first female soldiers that had to 
qualify with a rifle. During basic training, she 
was assigned as a permanent Squad Leader. 
In this role, she was responsible for super-
vising, motivating and maintaining account-
ability and ensuring soldier readiness. 
Mrs. Hodder was trained in several areas, 
including Quartermaster or Warehouse Spe-
cialist, Audio Visual Specialist and Office Man-
agement Specialist. As a Quartermaster Spe-
cialist, she was trained to track, pack, and 
ship items that others needed. As an Audio- 
Visual Specialist, she was trained to track, 
pack, ship, and prepare training material that 
military units needed to train their personnel. 
She also maintained the equipment needed to 
show the training material on. As an Office 
Management Specialist, she was assigned 
overseas for two years. During these two 
years, she handled the Official Government 
Mail and encrypted messages for her base. 
She wrote the Operations Manual for how to 
handle the classified mail, encrypted mes-
sages, and personnel management. During 
her time as an Office Management Specialist, 
she was assigned to work in the Base Com-
mander’s building for most of her tour of duty. 
In addition, she was assigned as the main 
company clerk for the Supply Company for a 
few weeks. This involved ensuring that the 
company correspondence and any personnel 
concerns were continually being processed. 
The opportunity to spend two years overseas, 
enhanced her ability to adapt to adverse situa-
tions, communicate with others in an effective 
manner, and to be continually aware of cul-
tural differences. She received an Army Com-
mendation Medal for her exceptional contribu-
tion to their Mission. 
During her time in the Military, she was se-
lected as Soldier of the Month in Fort Stewart, 
GA, and Camp Carroll, South Korea. This 
honor was received after stiff competition in 
front of Senior Military Enlisted soldiers. The 
competition involves presenting oneself in 
proper Military Uniform, answering several 
questions regarding the Military and current 
events. Her competition for Soldier of the 
Month at Ft. Stewart, GA consisted of Male In-
fantry Soldiers who had training for combat 
roles. The General, as the most senior man-
agement, of this base were quite impressed 
when she was selected. 
‘‘May the road rise to meet you, May the 
wind be always at your back, May the sun 
shine warm upon your face, The rains fall soft 
upon your fields and, Until we meet again, 
May God hold you in the palm of His hand.’’

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
TRANS-
ATLANTIC 
TELECOMMUNI-
CATIONS SECURITY ACT 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as co-chair 
of the Congressional Ukraine, Hungary, and 
Poland Caucuses, Member of the Baltic Cau-
cus, and friend to liberty-lovers across Central 
and Eastern Europe, I rise to introduce the bi-
partisan Transatlantic Telecommunications Se-
curity Act. I am thankful to my colleague Con-
gressman KINZINGER of Illinois for his co-lead-
ership and partnership on this measure, as 
well as his commitment to liberty in Europe. 
The United States and our NATO allies and 
partners in Central and Eastern Europe face 
down increased threats from global actors like 
a rising China and a belligerent Russia that 
seek to export their malign influence and un-
dermine democratic institutions. China seeks 
to compromise allied critical digital infrastruc-
ture by using state-linked companies like 
Huawei and ZTE to unfairly induce our allies 
to procure insecure telecommunications equip-
ment and services. Given immense economic 
potential from rapid 50 deployment, European 
countries feel significant pressure to use dan-
gerous Huawei equipment despite the political 
risks. 
Bipartisan current and former U.S. officials 
and civil society members have recognized 
the threat of malign influence over critical tele-
communications networks. 5G networks will 
serve as the backbone of artificial intelligence 
platforms with immense national security and 
domestic economic implications. 
Given these critical national security needs, 
the United States must provide our allies alter-
natives to Chinese financing and provide in-
creased diplomatic support to our allies to en-
sure secure telecommunications lines. This 
legislation would authorize the U.S. Develop-
ment Finance Corporation to provide financing 
for cross-border 5G telecommunications infra-
structure development to our allies. This fi-
nancing is key to remove risky and threatening 
equipment and replace it with secure equip-
ment. The legislation seeks to increase resil-
ience in countries in the region whose infra-
structure deficit from the Soviet-era makes 
them especially vulnerable to malign Chinese 
influence, including among nations in the 
Three Seas Initiative. 
Additionally, this bill directs the Secretary of 
State and other relevant agency heads to 
prioritize diplomacy and project support with 
European allies and partners to develop 5G 
markets that are inclusive, transparent, eco-
nomically viable, socially sustainable, and 
compliant with international law. Finally, this 
legislation ensures the United States is lead-
ing with our European allies to develop inter-
national SG standards that favor democratic 
institutions, not further authoritarianism spread 
by China and Russia. 
I am so thankful for the support of the Cen-
tral and East Europe Coalition, the National 
Federation of Croatian Americans, as well as 
the embassies of Czechia, Estonia, Kosovo, 
Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Poland, 
and Slovenia. 
The U.S. Congress must act to ensure the 
security of our NATO allies and partners. I 
urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
to support this legislation and look forward to 
working with Rep. KINZINGER towards this bill’s 
passage.

RECOGNIZING COLONEL HENRY L. 
‘‘HANK’’ ADAMS (USA, RET.) 
HON. TOM McCLINTOCK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a gentleman who defines 
devotion to country. Colonel Hank Adams en-
listed as an infantryman during World War II 
then proceeded to serve this country for 41 
years as a soldier in the United States Army. 
His steady advancement from private to ser-
geant major to second lieutenant and then 
colonel is testament to a life’s work under-
taking demanding and often dangerous as-
signments extremely well. Yet, immediately 
after his retirement from active duty, Col. 
Adams continued his work to make our armed 
forces the best they can be. For 34 years and 
counting, he has served as a U.S. Military 
Academy Liaison Officer relentlessly working 
to find and mentor the very best young men 
and women to lead our armed forces. 
Col. Adams has provided critical assistance 
to me and the citizens of California’s Fourth 
Congressional District. For 12 years, he has 
been the presiding member of my Service 
Academy Nomination Panel—and the only 
member with a Ruptured Duck on his lapel. 
His wise council and collegial coordination 
with the other former and active duty military 
officers on the panel has meant over 120 of 
the finest from this district have gone to our 
academies and then proceeded to protect this 
nation. 
We must remember and honor men like Col. 
Adams who have made this county the freest 
and therefore the greatest in history. His life-
time example of putting country above self is 
increasingly rare. All too often, it is forgotten 
that the freedoms we enjoy are afforded to us 
by the service and heroism of men Like Col. 
Adams. I am proud to rise today in gratitude 
and recognition of Col. Hank Adams’ 75 years 
of continuous, uninterrupted service to our 
country.

TRANSPORTATION 
INFRASTRUC-
TURE FINANCE AND INNOVATION 
ACT FOR AIRPORTS 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Transportation Infrastructure Fi-
nance and Innovation Act for Airports,’’ with 
U.S. Senator TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D–IL). I 
want to thank Representatives BRIAN BABIN 
(R–TX36), CONER
LAMB
(D–PA 17), JULIA 
BROWNLEY (D–CA26), and ADAM B. SCHIFF 
(D–CA28) and Senator JOHN CORNYN (R–TX) 
for their support as original cosponsors. 
The country that invented air travel should 
not have to look to other countries’ airports 
with envy. Congress must invest in modern-
izing our nation’s airports to better meet the 
traveling public’s needs and address public 
health concerns like coronavirus. Now more 
than ever, Americans deserve airports that are 
as efficient, safe, and clean as possible. 
In its most recent annual report card, the 
American Society of Civil Engineers gave our 
nation’s airports and related civilian aviation 
infrastructure a ‘‘D+’’ grade, requiring more 
than in $237 billion in total capital improve-
ments over the next 10 years. The ‘‘Transpor-
tation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation 
Act for Airports’’ is a good first step, unlocking 
approximately $2 billion in federal financing 
available as of fiscal year 2020 for airport 
modernization projects, including climate resil-
ience projects. 
Roadway and transit projects eligible under 
the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and 
Innovation Act (TIFIA) are already subject to 
‘‘Buy America’’ requirements. Our bicameral, 
bipartisan bill for this Congress incorporates 
the key provision from my ‘‘TIFIA for Airports

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

Baker for his 35 years of service with the

Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable. Volunteer fire-

IN SUPPORT OF S. 937 AND H. RES. 
275 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of S. 937, which brings per-
petrators of recent hate crimes against the 
Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) 
community to justice, and H. Res. 275, which 
mourns the targeting and killing of AAPI 
women in recent shootings in Atlanta. 
American history documents many dark pe-
riods of racism against the AAPI community. 
In 1854, the California Supreme Court ruled 
that Asian people were unfit to testify against 
White people in court. In 1871, seventeen Chi-
nese men and boys were publicly lynched in 
Los Angeles. The convictions of the perpetra-
tors were overturned and no one was pun-
ished. Starting in 1882, the Chinese Exclusion 
Act prohibited immigration from China. In the 
1940s, the U.S. military imprisoned tens of 
thousands of Japanese Americans during 
World War II over unfounded fears of immi-
grants aiding the enemy, even though no 
spies were ever found. This is but a short list 
of horrific acts of anti-AAPI racism in our 
country’s history. 
Over the last year, there has been an expo-
nential increase of anti-Asian rhetoric and hate 
crimes directed against the AAPI community. 
We had a president who placed blame on 
Asian Americans for the coronavirus, fanning 
the flames of intolerance and hatred. This in-
tolerance is unAmerican and we cannot ac-
cept it. 
Between March 19, 2020, and February 28, 
2021, there were nearly 3,800 reported cases 
of anti-Asian discrimination related to COVID– 
19, with 68 percent of reported incidents of 
anti-Asian hate targeted toward Asian-Amer-
ican women. These include violent attacks on 
innocent Asian Americans, including the most 
vulnerable among us, like pregnant women, 
children, and the elderly. 
We must fight this bigotry and prosecute 
perpetrators of hate crimes. The COVID–19 
Hate Crimes Act does this by directing the 
DOJ to expedite review of hate crimes; 
strengthening hate crimes reporting by local, 
state, and Tribal agencies; and raising aware-
ness about COVID–19-related hate crimes. 
I’m proud to cosponsor H.R. 1843, the 
House companion to S. 937, and I thank Sen-
ator 
MAZIE
HIRONO, 
Senator 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH, and Representative GRACE MENG 
for their important leadership in authoring this 
critical legislation. 
One of the worst instances of anti-AAPI 
hate occurred on March 16, 2021, when a 
shooter killed eight people at three Asian- 
owned spas in the greater Atlanta area. Six of 
the victims were Asian-American women. In H. 
Res. 275, the House mourns the victims of 
this horrific shooting, and I’m a cosponsor of 
it. 
I wish to acknowledge the names of the vic-
tims because we must never forget them: 
Xiaojie ‘‘Emily’’ Tan, Daoyou Feng, Delaina 
Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Yong Ae 
Yue, Soon Chung ‘‘Julie’’ Park, Hyun Jung 
Grant, and Sun Cha Kim. 
I thank my colleagues who led this resolu-
tion, Reps. JUDY CHU, CAROLYN BOURDEAUX, 
NIKEMA WILLIAMS, and LUCY MCBATH, together 
with Senator Rev. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, who 
led the Senate resolution. 
I am exceedingly proud to represent a vi-
brant community of hundreds of thousands of 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in Cali-
fornia’s 18th Congressional District which cele-
brates diversity as a strength and uses it as a 
source of our collective power. 
Over the last several weeks, I’ve attended 
rallies throughout my District where hundreds 
have gathered to stand against AAPI hate and 
celebrate the APPI community. I’ve stood arm- 
in-arm with my AAPI brothers and sisters, col-
leagues, constituents, neighbors, and friends 
to fight xenophobia, and I will continue doing 
so. 
I urge my colleagues to swiftly and unani-
mously pass S. 937 and H. Res. 275 to speak 
out, stand up, and fight Asian hate in all its 
ugly forms. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE 100TH 
BIRTHDAY OF ALMYRA ROURKE 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Almyra Rourke on the oc-
casion of her 100th birthday. Her contributions 
to our community as a Rosie the Riveter are 
worthy of commendation. 
Born in Shiawassee County, Michigan she 
studied bookkeeping at Lansing Business Col-
lege. After graduation, her work brought her to 
Ypsilanti where the Willow Run Bomber Plant 
was in need of workers in the payroll depart-
ment. When she went into the interview, the 
worker who interviewed her told her that she 
would be let go after the war since this was 
another man’s job. She started work that day 
along with six fellow graduates, the only 
women in a room full of men. 
What she had been told was a temporary 
role, became a career. After the war ended, 
Mrs. Rourke was transferred to Dearborn, 
Michigan and worked at Ford Motor Company 
for ten more years. At Willow Run, she worked 
on the balcony above the factory floor, and 
didn’t think of herself as a Rosie the Riveter 
because she was not building the planes, but 
a friend told her: ‘‘I couldn’t have built those 
bombers if you weren’t there to make sure I 
got paid every Friday. You’re as much a Rosie 
as I am!’’ As a Rosie, Almyra’s hard work, grit, 
and patriotism not only sustained the Amer-
ican war effort, but paved a path for the next 
generation of working women. 
After 
the 
war, 
she 
married 
Laurence 
Rourke, who served in the 3rd Armored Divi-
sion and was on the beaches of Normandy on 
D-Day. Mrs. Rourke eventually left work to 
take care of her three children, Shirlee, Ed-
ward, and Laurene. She was a Troop Leader 
and Mr. Rourke was a Scoutmaster. They 
were active members of St. John the Baptist 
Church in Ypsilanti. After the children left for 
college, they kept active through square danc-
ing clubs in Ann Arbor and by travelling the 
world—reaching all fifty states and even at-
tending the sixtieth anniversary of the libera-
tion of Belgium in 2004. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in celebrating Almyra Rourke on her 
100th birthday. I join with her family and 
friends in extending my best and warmest 
wishes to her on this special day. I am proud 
to honor her life, her accomplishments, and 
her invaluable contributions to our Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E557 
May 19, 2021 
pay or time from their civilian employment 
when they are mobilized by the DCNG. 
In 1899, Congress codified in the D.C. Code 
the original authority for entitlement to leave 
when federal civilian employees were mobi-
lized by the DCNG. In 1968, that authority was 
moved into 5 U.S.C. 6323. In that same year, 
Congress authorized two additional leave enti-
tlements in 5 U.S.C. 6323 as well as estab-
lished an offset provision in 5 U.S.C. 5519 ref-
erencing those two additional leave entitle-
ments. However, because the U.S. Code had 
not yet been updated to include the earlier 
DCNG authority, the Code contained a dupli-
cate subsection, one referring to DCNG mobi-
lizations and one to a more general leave enti-
tlement for the National Guard and Reserves. 
My bill would restore Congress’ original intent 
regarding DCNG mobilizations by correcting 
this legislative drafting error and clarifying that 
the pay and benefits of DCNG members who 
are federal civilian employees are not subject 
to the offset in 5 U.S.C. 5519. 
The only change required to fix this 
leislative drafting error is to remove the erro-
neous reference to DCNG mobilizations in 5 
U.S.C. 5519. This change would positively im-
pact the hundreds of dedicated federal civilian 
employees who are also members of the 
DCNG, providing them the full pay and bene-
fits they deserve. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING FIREFIGHTER MIKE 
PETENBRINK 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Firefighter Mike 
Petenbrink for his 35 years of service with the 
Meyersdale Volunteer Fire Department in 
Somerset County, Pennsylvania. 
Firefighters’ commitment and service to our 
community are invaluable, Volunteer fire-
fighters often are called on to respond to 
emergencies of all types. From battling struc-
ture fires to conducting search and rescue op-
erations, volunteer firefighters respond imme-
diately whenever disaster strikes. These he-
roes often go above and beyond—they teach 
first aid, educate students about fire and other 
dangerous hazards, and even install car safety 
seats for children. Through their diverse and 
often-difficult work, volunteer firefighters pro-
vide lifesaving services and are a staple of our 
local community. 
Firefighter Petenbrink has worked through-
out his career to serve the people of Somerset 
County. On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th 
Congressional District, I thank him for his work 
to protect life and property in our community 
and wish him continued health, safety, and 
success.

IN HONOR OF DR. TOBE JOHNSON 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, May 19, 2021 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in sadness and in joy to celebrate 
the life of a good and great Morehouse Man, 
Dr. 
Tobe 
Johnson. 
Sadly. 
Dr. 
Johnson 
transitioned from labor to reward on Friday, 
May 7, 2021, at the age of 91. A homegoing 
service will be held on Friday, May 21, 2021, 
at 11 AM, on the campus of Morehouse Col-
lege in Atlanta, Georgia. While his passing 
leaves in its wake many heavy hearts, upon 
prayerful reflection the pain we share must 
melt into joy. For, Dr. Johnson leaves a re-
markable legacy of service to humanity as a 
scholar, teacher, husband, father, mentor, 
confidant, and friend of longstanding to many. 
A native of Birmingham, Alabama, Dr. Tobe 
Johnson was born on September 16, 1929, to 
the late Mr. Tobe Johnson and Mrs. Evelyn 
Johnson. He grew up in a Black, working- 
class community, entered Morehouse College 
in Atlanta at age 16, but was forced to leave 
school and work at a steel plant back in Ala-
bama. He joined the Air Force, serving in 
Japan, and following his discharge, returned to 
Morehouse College to complete his under-
graduate degree—a B.A. in Political Science, 
in 1954. He attended Columbia University in 
New York, becoming the first Black person to 
receive a Ph.D. in Government from that insti-
tution. After receiving his Doctorate and teach-
ing at Prairie View A&M University in Texas, 
he was recruited by Dr. Benjamin E. Mays to 
join the faculty at Morehouse College, where 
he served in many capacities before his retire-
ment in 2018. 
Dr. Johnson graduated from Morehouse 
right as the Supreme Court outlawed racial 
segregation in public schools. This monu-
mental decision stimulated his interest in ana-
lyzing political structures and influencing long- 
term change. This was an early victory fol-
lowed by others such as the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and 
motivated Dr. Johnson to use his skills to help 
Black political advancement. 
Dr. Johnson, as a teacher, researcher, writ-
er, and administrator, was an icon on the 
Morehouse College faculty, where he was 
hailed as the institution’s longest-serving fac-
ulty member. He taught at the school for al-
most 60 years, was an Avalon professor, and 
served as Chair of the Political Science De-
partment. He established and conducted, at 
Morehouse, a rare Peace Corps volunteer 
training program in the South. He impacted 
the lives of countless Morehouse men, such 
as Jeh Johnson, who would become the U.S. 
Secretary of Homeland Security; Randall L. 
Woodfin, the youngest mayor ever elected in 
Birmingham, Alabama; and Maynard H. Jack-
son, Jr., Atlanta’s first Black mayor. 
As a Student Assistant in the Political 
Science Department for 2 years, I worked di-
rectly for Dr. Johnson doing research. He was 
precise, analytical, data-driven, and brutally 
frank in his approach and had the highest 
standards of integrity and validation for his re-
search. He became my mentor, role model, 
wise counsel, and friend of longstanding. He 
took great pride in my elections and my serv-
ice in the Georgia General Assembly for 16 
years and my service in the U.S. Congress for 
29 years. I am truly blessed that he helped 
shape my life. 
During his career, he received numerous 
honors, awards, and special recognitions. 
Sir Winston Churchill often said: ‘‘You make 
your living by what you get, you make your life 
by what you give.’’ Dr. Johnson gave so much 
to so many for so long and truly made his life. 
His public service, his advocacy for students, 
his devotion to Morehouse College, and his 
service to his community and his nation, re-
flect the legacy he leaves and the joy we must 
celebrate. Truly the world is a better place be-
cause Dr. Tobe Johnson passed this way. 
Dr. Johnson accomplished much in his life. 
but none of it would have been possible with-
out the Grace of God and the love and the 
support of his wife of 61 years. Goldie: his 
children, Cheryl and Tobe III; and a host of 
family and friends who will miss him dearly. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
U.S. House of Representatives to join my wife, 
Vivian, and me, along with countless others 
throughout Georgia and the nation in saluting 
and honoring Dr. Tobe Johnson for his service 
in the education and political sectors, to his 
country, and to humankind; and in extending 
our deepest condolences to Dr. Johnson’s 
family, friends, loved ones, and all those who 
mourn his loss. We pray that they will be con-
soled and comforted by an abiding faith and 
the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and months 
ahead.
