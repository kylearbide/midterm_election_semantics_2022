PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Immortal, invisible, God only wise, 
deepen the appreciation of Your truth 
in our hearts. Unchanging, unwavering, 
God eternal, root Your strength in our 
souls. 
For Your word endures forever, and 
your counsel stands for perpetuity. 
May our meager efforts find their foun-
dation in Your eternal plan. May our 
decisions be rooted in Your everlasting 
word. 
Use us in this time and this place 
that even the least of our accomplish-
ments would find worth in Your design. 
Guide us in these days that the most 
inconsequential elements of our work 
would have value in Your eyes. 
In each fleeting moment, confront us 
with the opportunity to acknowledge 
that You are present, here, now, and in 
every minute of our lives. And may we 
serve to glorify You this day. 
In Your presence we stand, and in 
Your name we pray. 
Amen.

SLAVERY REMEMBRANCE DAY 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. I rise today some 400 
years after slavery was introduced to 
the United States in 1619. I rise today 
proud of this House of Representatives 
because on yesterday, the House ap-
proved a historic Slavery Remem-
brance Day resolution. 
Madam Speaker, in the out years, 
this resolution is going to prove to be 
very beneficial to our country. You 
will find slavery remembrance com-
memorations 
going 
on 
across 
the 
length and breadth of the country. This 
is because we never want to repeat the 
horrors of slavery. 
So, I thank every Member of this 
House who voted for this resolution. 
Each of you will receive from me a per-
sonal thank you as well as a com-
memorative booklet so that you can 
place this prominently some place in 
your home or your office because it 
was a historic occasion, and it will 
make a difference in the lives of people 
across the length and breadth of this 
country. 
I am so proud of you, and I thank 
you. God bless you.

AMERICA IS IN A RECESSION 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the government announced 
what every American has been feeling 
for nearly a year: We are in a recession. 
This news is a grim milestone that 
points toward more hardship, more suf-
fering, and more pain for the American 
people. But even as we were expecting 
today’s news, let me address what hap-
pened in the past 24 hours. 
The Senate passed a bill that took a 
small, 
discretionary 
program 
and 
turned it into a $280 billion blank 
check, including $79 billion in manda-
tory spending on corporate welfare to 
be handed out to whoever President 
Biden wants. 
For the record, I am a ‘‘no’’ on the 
Senate CHIPS bill that will come to 
the floor today. I was a ‘‘no’’ last week. 
I was a ‘‘no’’ last night. And I will be 
the first ‘‘no’’ on the board later today. 
I urge all my Republican colleagues 
to join me. Reject this deeply flawed 
bill. Let’s start from scratch. 
And if that wasn’t enough, Senate 
Democrats then announced they want 
to spend another half a trillion dollars 
during a recession. Democrats say they 
want to lower inflation, but do you 
know what their new bill does? It gives 
you a $7,500 tax credit to buy an $80,000 
electric vehicle for people making up 
to $300,000. 
They 
say 
they 
want 
to 
restore 
growth, but their new bill adds $700 bil-
lion in new taxes, including a $300 bil-
lion made in America tax that punishes 
anyone who wants to build, manufac-
ture, or invest in America. 
They say they want to help strug-
gling families, but do you know what 
their new bill does? Who do they hire? 
They hire 87,000 new IRS agents to 
audit them and spy on their bank ac-
counts. That is what the Democrat ma-
jority wants. 
They say they want to lower prices, 
but their new bill will allow bureau-
crats to decide what drugs seniors can

July 28, 2022 
access and destroy the hope of any new 
cures or treatments for diseases like 
cancer. 
And do you know what? They are not 
done yet. 
Mr. Speaker, do Democrats really be-
lieve that spending hundreds of billions 
of tax dollars right now while pursuing 
and punishing productive investments 
in the long run will lower inflation? 
Policies like that don’t lower inflation; 
they cause inflation. 
They are going to spend more dollars 
chasing the same goods with fewer jobs 
and lower income in the long run all 
during a recession. 
But I know what you are going to 
say: It is okay because you changed the 
definition of a ‘‘recession’’ now. You 
know, Einstein once said, and we all 
know it: ‘‘The definition of insanity is 
doing the same thing over and over and 
expecting a different result.’’ So what 
you really should do is just go with 
changing the definition. Maybe people 
won’t hear you or understand it. 
We all know across this country what 
caused inflation: Democrats winning 
the House, the Senate, and the Presi-
dency. And now you are doubling down 
on the same failed policies. Was the 
worst inflation in 40 years not enough? 
Are they trying to see how high they 
can get it all while forcing the Amer-
ican people to pay the bills for your 
failures? 
Democrats just can’t help them-
selves. They simply don’t care about 
the consequences. 
Which brings me to this morning’s 
news, the Bureau of Economic Analysis 
announced the GDP fell by 0.9 percent 
in the second quarter. I am not sure, 
Mr. Speaker, if everybody is lined up to 
talk about that today. This comes 
after a 1.6 percent decline in the econ-
omy in the first quarter. So half of this 
year our economy shrank. 
It is no wonder an overwhelming 8 in 
10 Americans feel the economy is head-
ing in the wrong direction. And the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
nesses—this is a survey of small busi-
nesses—found that the confidence is at 
its lowest level in 48 years. But I guess 
that is Putin’s fault. 
Consumers and businesses are losing 
hope, and there is no secret why. Every 
week the American people know we are 
able to buy less with the money we 
have. Every week at the gas pump we 
are paying nearly twice as much to fill 
up our tanks. Every month the Amer-
ican people know when they get their 
pay stubs they are making less in real 
wages. And every day the American 
people understand the simple truth: We 
cannot afford Democrats’ failed poli-
cies. But we are certainly paying for 
them. 
Of 
course, 
President 
Biden 
and 
Speaker PELOSI won’t admit it. Their 
response to rising prices has been to 
issue dismissals, denials, distortions, 
and a little deceptive spin. 
Remember when President Biden told 
us last July that inflation was tem-
porary and expected? Remember that 
right there? Then he told us in Decem-
ber that inflation had peaked, no more 
fear, it has peaked. That was at 7.0 per-
cent. Democrats tried to convince us 
that inflation was a good thing. 
Remember Secretary Yellen said this 
week that a recession isn’t a recession, 
but rather, our country is in a period of 
transition in which growth is slowing. 
That is weird, huh? We all learned that 
a recession is really easy. You take two 
quarters in a row and you have nega-
tive growth. But it is weird, beginning 
this week the White House told us, I 
don’t know, I looked in every book, but 
we are changing the definition now. We 
changed each and every place of where 
we went. 
When it started, it was temporary. 
First, it was COVID’s fault. Then, don’t 
worry, it is transitory, it is not going 
to stay. Then we found out corporate 
greed is doing this; then it is just a 
high-class problem, their problem, no-
body else’s. Then it is okay, it has 
peaked. But then when it went a little 
higher, it is the supply chain’s fault 
now. No, no, no, no. Now, it is Putin’s 
fault. Eventually America may believe 
something. Then it is just out of date. 
Now, no, no it is not a recession, the 
economy is just slowing. 
You would rather redefine a recession 
than restore a healthy economy? 
You know, the American people 
know that inflation was not tem-
porary. Inflation hadn’t peaked, and 
now we are in a recession. But the 
Democrats continue to talk down to 
American families no matter the in-
creased cost of nearly everything. 
But you know the worst part about 
all of this? And I see people here ready 
to speak. Madam Speaker, I wonder if 
anyone is going to speak and show us 
your plan. Show us your plan to get us 
out of recession. Show us your plan to 
make our streets safe again. Show us 
your plan that you are going to 
produce more and lower the gas price. 
I guess your plan is just redefine and 
blame something else. 
Their failed policies have not only 
made inflation worse, you created it. 
Democrats have increased total gov-
ernment spending by over $9 trillion in 
less than 18 months. For every Amer-
ican, if you wonder, do elections have 
consequences? Yes, they do. Oh, yes, 
they do. $9 trillion in 18 months. 
The Democrats control the House, 
they control the Senate, they control 
the White House. This is what they 
brought us. We have not felt this in 
more than four decades. Sixty percent 
of every American has never lived 
through inflation above 4 percent. 
They halted energy projects, slowed 
down pipeline construction, and took 
every step to discourage American oil 
and gas production. You know, when 
they had the majority like they do 
right now, they brought in all the en-
ergy companies. Not one Democrat 
asked: How could we lower the gas 
price? Do you know what they made 
every CEO do? They asked them: Would 
you promise to produce less next year 
because we want the gas price higher? 
We want to punish Americans. That 
was their question, to produce less. 
They want to intimidate them. 
And they crippled the labor market 
by paying people to stay home instead 
of going back to work, including them-
selves. 
b 1015 
This is the only place in America you 
can go and enjoy a wedding in France 
for some movie star and still vote on 
this floor and get paid for it. This is 
the only place in America you can be 
on a boat celebrating and still vote in 
this House or in your committee and 
get paid for it. This is the only place in 
America, and this is the only Congress 
that has ever allowed it—ever. It 
doesn’t matter what we have ever gone 
through, a pandemic, a war. 
Do you know what, Madam Speaker? 
I don’t see one Member wearing a 
mask, and we were only going to keep 
that during the pandemic. I see one. I 
stand corrected. But I guess the rest of 
you feel it is okay. 
If this sounds like a healthy economy 
to you, I hear there is an opening at 
the White House press office. But for 
the rest of us that live in reality, it is 
painful. 
I want to ask everybody in America: 
Can you afford to give up 1 month of 
income? Think about that. Could you 
afford to give 1 month of your pay up? 
I don’t know very many people in my 
district who can. 
Madam Speaker, maybe Paul Pelosi 
can, but nobody else that I know can. 
But that is exactly what you took 
from every single American. You see, 
inflation is so high, every single Amer-
ican has lost a full month’s pay. 
Can Americans afford to keep the 
Democrats in power? Could you afford 
to lose another month’s pay? Or do you 
feel good that it is not a recession or it 
is Putin’s fault? 
If you had a constant salary like ev-
erybody in this body, 1 month is 8.3 
percent of those 12 months. Inflation is 
higher, so you just lost a full salary. 
You have less money, but you pay 
more at the gas pump. 
But it is okay. Tell everybody to go 
buy an electric car at $80,000. I wonder 
what your answer is to the homeless. 
Buy a house? 
If you think about this, this is actu-
ally the Pelosi pay cut because not one 
American voted for your $2 trillion in-
flation-creating bill. Not one. The 
Pelosi pay cut affects every American, 
but do you know what? It is especially 
hard on families who have extra ex-
penses. 
I don’t know if you watched the clip, 
but I watched this clip of a 15-year-old 
girl named Jinger Vincent from Indi-
ana. This poor girl was diagnosed with 
bone cancer, and she has to travel 
every week for treatment. It is located 
more than an hour away. Last year, 
her parents, Keith and Analiza, paid 
around $100 each week for that trip, but 
because of the surging gas price—but it

is okay if I listen to the Democrats; 
the President said it is a good thing— 
they are now spending more than $200 
each week. They also have two other 
children. 
The Vincents said they simply can’t 
afford a price hike, and they have 
turned to loans to cover the costs. Can 
you imagine having to take a loan to 
pay for the gas to take your 15-year-old 
daughter to get cancer treatment and 
at the same time losing a full month’s 
pay? 
Do you know what is worse? In this 
story, that 15-year-old girl, Jinger— 
having to watch her parents say: We 
have to pay this bill, and we have to 
pay that. This is what she said: And I 
am downstairs, and I hear all that. It 
just seems so stressful. They shouldn’t 
have to go through this. 
Madam Speaker, my question is, do 
Democrats 
agree 
with 
Secretary 
Buttigieg that the more pain families 
like the Vincents feel at the pump is a 
good thing? Madam Speaker, that is 
the Secretary of Transportation. 
I guess they seem to agree with them 
because rather than having a plan to 
lower gas prices, their answer is to tell 
the Vincents and others to buy a Tesla. 
They are borrowing money to pay for 
gas, and you are telling them to buy a 
Tesla. 
But do you know who is probably 
happy because with their new deal, you 
can make $300,000, and that same tax-
payer that just lost a month’s salary 
that has to get a loan to pay for gas, 
they have to pay more in taxes so 
somebody else wealthy can get that tax 
break—that is not compassion. It is 
cruelty, and the American people are 
suffering the consequences every day. 
Americans 
aren’t 
imagining 
that 
their grocery bills are higher than 
ever; they are. Americans aren’t imag-
ining that they have to pay more to fill 
up their gas tanks; they do. They are 
not imagining that their savings are 
shrinking and their 401(k)’s have be-
come 201(k)’s; they are. 
But let me tell you what they are ac-
tually living through, what they are 
afraid of, and what keeps them up at 
night: higher taxes and higher energy 
costs; the first house they will never be 
able to afford because prices are rising 
and their incomes are falling; retire-
ment savings that will no longer last 
long enough. They are worried about 
how much worse it can get if Demo-
crats’ failed policies continue. 
You think for all this suffering that 
they have caused, there is no way that 
Democrats would do this on purpose. 
Guess again. 
Everything about the Biden recession 
was predictable and avoidable. Only 
Democrats in Washington chose not to 
see it coming. I remember coming to 
this exact floor, warning that if you 
pass nearly $2 trillion of the American 
Rescue Plan, you would cause infla-
tion. I listened to the other side. They 
said it was going to save us. But that 
inflation is exactly what happened. 
It is interesting when you look at 
these lines, producer price inflation. 
You don’t even have to put it here, but 
I bet you could predict when Biden was 
inaugurated. That is when it all goes 
up. 
But when did your wages start to 
drop? The day he was sworn in. The day 
the Democrats took the majority in 
the House, the Senate, and the White 
House. 
When did it really start dropping 
hard? The day they passed the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. 
But I know they want to reject what 
Republicans say. They don’t want to 
listen to Republicans. But do you know 
what? Why don’t you listen to Larry 
Summers? He worked in the Obama- 
Biden administration as the Director of 
the National Economic Council. He was 
the Secretary of the Treasury in Bill 
Clinton’s administration. Before the 
vote, he told everybody the American 
Rescue Plan could set off inflationary 
pressures of a kind we have not seen in 
a generation. I guess he was right. 
Jason Furman, an economic adviser to 
the Obama-Biden administration, said 
the same thing. 
The American Rescue Plan was defi-
nitely too big for the moment. I don’t 
know any economist that was recom-
mending something the size of what 
was done, but every Democrat was. 
Why don’t we go to Steve Rattner, 
another Obama-Biden economist? What 
did he say? The American Rescue Plan 
was the Democrats’ original sin when 
it comes to inflation. Think about 
that. Steve Rattner, who worked in the 
Obama-Biden administration to try to 
help them during an economic crisis, 
especially when it came to the auto-
mobile industry, says this is the origi-
nal sin, the American Rescue Plan, 
that caused inflation. He didn’t say it 
was Putin’s fault. He didn’t say it was 
temporary. He didn’t apologize after-
ward because he didn’t have to. He 
warned you about it. 
Treasury Secretary Yellen—I don’t 
know how many calls she made to try 
to twist arms to get people to vote for 
it or how many times she went on TV 
telling the American public that this 
was a good thing, that this was going 
to put us on the right path—she admit-
ted in May that she missed the biggest 
explosion of inflation in over 40 years. 
She said, ‘‘I was wrong then about the 
path that inflation would take.’’ 
She was wrong when she told us it 
was transitory. She was wrong when 
she told people to vote for it. 
Either Democrats didn’t see the 
worst inflation in 40 years coming, or 
they did and still believed your suf-
fering was worth the incredible transi-
tion. That explains why President 
Biden, Speaker PELOSI, and Senator 
SCHUMER are still peddling anti-energy 
policies, plus almost a trillion in new 
spending and new taxes on Main 
Street, even as these policies destroy 
our country. 
It explains why we have John Kerry, 
Biden’s Special Presidential Envoy for 
Climate, saying: We absolutely don’t 
need to produce more oil and gas in 
America. 
This is the leadership of America. We 
don’t need to produce more oil and gas 
in America, so we will stop the pipeline 
on the first day. We will tell those 
American workers they are not going 
to work in America, but we are going 
to go over to Saudi Arabia. 
I guess you keep some promises in a 
campaign when you say you are going 
to shut down oil and gas in America 
but don’t keep the promise about Saudi 
Arabia. You go there and you fist-bump 
and hope you are going to get more: 
Could you produce more for America? 
Do you know what is so sad about all 
of this? You have no plan to fix it, but 
you had the plan to destroy it. It 
wasn’t just Republicans who warned 
you about it. It was your very own 
Democrats who were in Obama’s ad-
ministration, who were economic ad-
visers, who warned you before the vote 
that you would create inflation. Then 
you took that vote. 
Only Democrats passed that bill. 
Only Democrats created inflation. Only 
Democrats have shut down our oil and 
gas, and we haven’t even gotten to 
defunding the police. I don’t know how 
many times people can warn you. 
You can go to my home State, to the 
city of San Francisco, Republicans 
there register only about 6.7 percent. 
They are not even the second party, 
but 
even 
San 
Francisco 
has 
had 
enough. They recalled their school 
board against the same policies you 
passed on this floor. They recalled 
their DA. 
It is not just Republicans telling you 
it is hurting; it is America. But you 
still have no plan, not one plan. We are 
1 more day here before we are out into 
August. There isn’t one plan proposed. 
Or I guess your plan is to follow the 
President to Saudi Arabia. 
But your plan that you announced 
yesterday, the plan you are going to 
vote on this floor today, is only going 
to create more inflation. You are going 
to take another paycheck away. 
It explains why this week and the 
week before and the week before that, 
and every week in this House you have 
been in session, the Democrats have of-
fered no plan to fight inflation. You 
only fuel it. It is basic economics. 
Madam Speaker, in 40 years, we have 
never experienced this. The last time 
we experienced this, we had a Demo-
crat-controlled 
House, 
Senate, 
and 
White House. 
You have no plan to increase energy 
production to lower the price of gaso-
line. In fact, just this week and last 
week, 218 House Democrats voted to 
continue to sell our strategic oil to 
Communist China. You voted on that 
on the floor. You have done it twice. 
So, not only do you not have a plan, 
but you are defending China taking the 
oil we saved to protect America. You 
have no plan to reconnect workers to 
jobs by ending incentives that pay 
more to stay home than pursue produc-
tive work. 
Madam Speaker, Americans know 
the Democrats have no plan to rebuild

an economy that works for us—none 
whatsoever. 
b 1030 
Republicans have a plan. We are pre-
pared to build an economy that is 
strong and one that fights inflation by 
officially ending this disastrous Build 
Back 
Better, 
eliminating 
wasteful 
spending, and getting Americans back 
to work in the workforce. 
Do you know where we will start? 
Right here on this floor. 
You will have to show up for work to 
be paid, just like every other Amer-
ican. No, you can’t take your European 
trips and phone it in. 
To the American public: Let’s just be 
honest, Why won’t the Democrats lift 
the proxy voting? 
Because every person who votes 
proxy, signs—by penalty of perjury— 
they can’t come in because of COVID. I 
imagine if that person had COVID they 
probably wouldn’t have been let into 
that wedding in France or on that 
houseboat with their family or at the 
fundraiser in Ohio trying to run for the 
Senate. 
Madam Speaker, it starts by exam-
ple. If you are not willing to produce a 
plan, if you are not willing to have 
your own Members show up to work, 
and if you are not willing to be honest 
with the American people, then get out 
of the way and let somebody else lead. 
We have an economy in our plan that 
will be driven by pro-growth economic 
policies that deliver higher paychecks 
and that don’t take them away from 
you. They will lower costs, boost Main 
Street, and encourage innovation. 
It will be an economy with lower gas-
oline prices—yes—by increasing pro-
duction in America with American- 
made energy, not begging the Saudis 
for more. We will approve more oil and 
gas pipelines here at home, and we will 
prioritize 
reliable, 
resilient 
energy 
grids. 
Do you know what it will do to not 
just the economy, not just more Amer-
icans working, and not just lowering 
the fuel price that will lower inflation? 
It will improve the environment. 
You see, Madam Speaker, American 
natural gas is 41 percent cleaner than 
Russian natural gas. We will secure our 
supply chain and no longer be depend-
ent on China. 
Madam Speaker, I know the Demo-
crats will continue to vote to defend 
China to make sure they get our Stra-
tegic Petroleum Reserve. We will keep 
bringing it up so that every time I 
watch a Democrat on TV say that they 
are opposed to it, but they walk into 
this room—or they are in their wed-
dings or on their fundraisers and they 
phone in their votes—and they defend 
China, we will defend America. 
It is time for a new direction in 
Washington to get our Nation back on 
track. Americans deserve a future 
filled with hope, opportunities, and 
freedom, and Republicans stand ready 
to deliver. 
I wait patiently for one Democrat to 
tell me their plan to reverse inflation, 
to lower the gasoline prices, and not 
celebrate the pain they are causing 
every American. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SCHRIER). Members are reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, a point 
of clarification, are we doing Special 
Orders or 1 minutes? 
I think there is a time set aside every 
day for Special Orders. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair is currently entertaining re-
quests for 1-minute speeches. The mi-
nority leader was recognized for the 
customary time.

REMEMBERING DAVID TRIMBLE 
(Mr. NEAL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I stand 
today to pay tribute to David Trimble, 
an important contributor to the forma-
tion and the success of the Good Friday 
Agreement and the original First Min-
ister for Northern Ireland. I got to 
know David very well, and it is unfor-
tunate that he has left us too early. 
All of the political parties in the 
North put aside longstanding animos-
ities and came together to make the 
Good Friday Agreement possible. David 
Trimble showed uncommon courage to 
ignore dissenting voices in the Union-
ist community to achieve that historic 
accord. 
For all of us, sometimes it is difficult 
to say no to our own side. It was not an 
easy process. There were many months 
of negotiations, and not everybody got 
what they wanted, but the Nobel Prize 
that he and John Hume received in 1998 
was a reflection of those tough deci-
sions. As we approach the 25th anniver-
sary of the agreement, it endures be-
cause of his patient approach, coupled 
with a keen focus on dialogue. 
My deepest condolences to his wife, 
Daphne, and family. Today, we know 
that on the island of Ireland, peace is 
within our sight because of the work 
that David Trimble contributed.

CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF KWAM 
RADIO 
(Mr. KUSTOFF asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. KUSTOFF. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the 75th anni-
versary of The Mighty 990 radio station 
in Memphis. Its call letters, KWAM, 
stand for We Are Memphis. 
Over the years, legendary musicians, 
including Elvis Presley, have been as-
sociated with The Mighty 990. 
Today, the radio station is owned by 
Memphis native, Todd Starnes who 
transformed KWAM into a news talk 
radio station with an emphasis on de-
veloping local talent. 
KWAM is a strong voice for people 
across west Tennessee and the entire 
country broadcasting from the banks 
of the mighty Mississippi. 
KWAM’s roster of talent includes 
Todd Starnes’ nationally syndicated 
show, 
Tim 
Van 
Horn, 
and 
Earle 
Farrell, along with Chett and Dr. 
Sherrie Hopper. 
Congratulations 
to 
KWAM 
The 
Mighty 990 on this historic milestone.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
today I seek recognition and rise to ad-
dress the growing barriers to homeown-
ership and skyrocketing rents. 
Families that have lived in the city 
of New York for generations are being 
pushed out. These families have signifi-
cant ties to the community and con-
tribute to the cultural exchange that 
New York City is known for. 
Homeownership is one of the best 
ways to gain equity and build genera-
tional wealth. Yet, there are millions 
of Americans who aren’t able to buy 
into the housing market. 
As a member of the Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Transportation, and 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies, I am proud to have 
worked with my colleagues to draft a 
bill that would address this issue. 
But we must do more. The bill pro-
vides a total of $62.7 billion for HUD 
which includes funding to protect hous-
ing assistance for more than 4.8 million 
individuals. It also expands housing 
choice vouchers to more than 140,000 
low-income individuals and families at 
risk of homelessness. 
We must continue to enact policies 
that ensure all residents can live with-
out being burdened by housing costs.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DONALD 
KELLER 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to salute and pay tribute to a 
member of the Greatest Generation in 
celebration of his 100th birthday. Don-
ald Keller is a World War II veteran 
who has lived in Strasburg, Virginia, 
for almost his whole life. 
At 21, Keller joined the Army as a 
radio operator, and he served in the 
military for almost 2 years from 1943 to 
1945. During his deployment, he was 
awarded two Purple Hearts, one after 
being wounded in Normandy and the 
other when he was injured in Luxem-
bourg during the Battle of the Bulge. 
Keller later received the French Legion 
of Honor for carrying two injured sol-
diers to safety while he himself was in-
jured. 
After Keller fought in the war, he re-
turned to Strasburg where he served 
the city by opening his own radio re-
pair company.

The Sixth District thanks Donald 
Keller for his service and contributions 
to the city of Strasburg. 
His commitment to the city is clear-

So, again, I thank him for his serv-

ARIZONA IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN 
SEMICONDUCTOR 
MANUFAC-
TURING 
(Mr. STANTON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
STANTON. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
thanks to years of hard work, we have 
made Arizona a global leader in semi-
conductor manufacturing. It is one of 
our State’s fastest-growing industries. 
We have supported innovative, local 
companies that produce base materials, 
we have trained a talented STEM 
workforce through our colleges and 
universities, and we have attracted bil-
lions of dollars in investment to build 
semiconductor fabs in the Valley of the 
Sun. 
These days microchips are in every-
thing from consumer electronics and 
cars to technologies that support our 
national defense. Increasingly, those 
chips are made in Arizona. In the fu-
ture, I want more of those chips to be 
manufactured in Arizona. That was 
why I was an early and vocal supporter 
of the CHIPS Act. 
It comes down to one word: jobs. 
This bill will help drive down costs 
for consumers and lower our reliance 
on foreign countries all while creating 
and supporting tens of thousands of 
high-paying jobs in my home State of 
Arizona. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill to re-
charge America’s economy.

PROTECTING AMERICA FROM THE 
LEFT’S OUT-OF-CONTROL SPEND-
ING 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, the new GDP numbers an-
nounced this morning confirm that 
Washington Democrats’ reckless spend-
ing has sent our Nation into a reces-
sion. On top of paying an extra $5,200 
this year because of the President’s in-
flation crisis, Americans are now hav-
ing to live in fear that they will see 
their paychecks cut or they will lose 
their jobs. 
This incredibly troubling news comes 
just 1 day after the Federal Reserve 
hiked interest rates, which means more 
Americans won’t be able to afford to 
buy a car or a new home. 
Forty-year 
high 
inflation, 
sky-
rocketing interest rates, and now a re-
cession—these are the disastrous con-
sequences of one-party Democrat rule 
in Congress and in the White House. 
What is their predictable reaction? 
Yesterday, they announced a bill to 
increase taxes and to spend hundreds of 
billions of more dollars. It is shameful. 
I will fight tooth and nail to protect 
Americans from the left’s out-of-con-
trol spending.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DETROIT 
POLICE OFFICER LOREN COURTS 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor the life of fallen Detroit 
Police Officer Loren Courts. 
Officer Courts died in the line of duty 
at the age of 40 on July 6, 2022. I and all 
Michiganders share in the grief during 
this difficult time. 
A 5-year veteran of the department 
and second-generation officer, Officer 
Courts risked his safety and ultimately 
sacrificed his life protecting his com-
munity. He will be remembered by his 
loved ones as a remarkable public serv-
ant, friend, son, husband, and father. 
Madam Speaker, I ask all of my col-
leagues to join me in honoring the life 
and service of Officer Loren Courts of 
the Detroit Police Department.

BUILD BACK BROKE CAUSED 
RECESSION 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
well, here are the numbers: gross do-
mestic product is down another 0.9 per-
cent on this quarter on top of last 
quarter’s 1.6 percent drop in GDP for 
the second straight quarter. 
Why? 
There are several factors: the high 
cost of energy and energy being shut 
down in this country—energy affects 
everything—inflation, and profligate 
spending by government have driven us 
into a situation where we have—yes, 
we will say the word—a recession. 
Now, there are 38 different edits to 
the terminology of recession. However, 
the definition of recession on the 
Wikipedia page is not going to change 
the fact that the policies of over-
spending, choking regulations, and bad 
energy policy have made it impossible 
for people to afford anything anymore. 
Indeed, it has been a tax upon people’s 
income. 
Approximately 
one 
full 
month’s paycheck is lost to Americans 
because of these high costs. 
So instead of playing around on 
Wikipedia redefining what recession is, 
let’s get back to work and put things 
together on our energy policies, supply 
chain, and, indeed, stop the profligate 
spending of build back broke. 
RECOGNIZING WOMEN ATHLETES 
AT 
NORTH 
CAROLINA 
STATE 
UNIVERSITY 
(Ms. ROSS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the extraordinary 
achievements of the women athletes at 
North Carolina State University. 
In addition to the women’s basket-
ball team winning their third straight 
ACC championship, the women’s cross- 
country team won their first NCAA 
championship. And we also have the 
accomplishments of many more. 
Last spring, seniors on the women’s 
tennis team won the NCAA doubles 
championship. 
Katharine Berkoff also claimed the 
100-yard backstroke national title for 
the second year in a row, while Katelyn 
Tuohy stormed to victory on the track 
in the 5,000 meters. 
Last month, we celebrated the 50th 
anniversary of Title IX, the foundation 
of gender equity at educational institu-
tions. This milestone serves as an im-
portant reminder that too often women 
athletes don’t get the recognition they 
deserve. 
Congratulations 
to 
the 
Wolfpack 
women on these amazing accomplish-
ments.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
SHERIFF GRADY JUDD 
(Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, this past week, my 
sheriff and friend, Grady Judd, cele-
brated 50 years of service with the Polk 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Department. 
Belovedly known as ‘‘America’s Sher-
iff,’’ Grady is renowned for his plain- 
spoken style and relentless commit-
ment to the rule of law. People from all 
over the world tune into his live- 
streamed press conferences to hear his 
Gradyisms, such as, ‘‘You can’t fix stu-
pid, but you can arrest it.’’ 
Grady joined the department in 1972, 
at the age of 18. He rose quickly 
through the ranks and has served as 
sheriff since 2004. He has been ap-
proached many times throughout his 
career for running for higher office but 
has always responded, Why in the 
world would I want to do that? I have 
the best job in the world already. 
His half century of service is just one 
example of how seriously he takes his 
commitments. Less than 1 month after 
joining the department all those years 
ago, he married his sweetheart, Marisa. 
They will celebrate their 50th wedding 
anniversary on September 16; and are 
the proud parents of 2 sons and 13 
grandchildren. 
Thank you, Sheriff, for all you do to 
keep our community safe and for being 
such a good and decent man.

HONORING THE LIFE AND 
SACRIFICE OF RICHARD LOPEZ 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN
asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and sac-
rifice of Yavapai County Sheriff Dep-
uty Richard Lopez, who was killed in 
the line of duty last month. 
I was incredibly humbled to attend 
Officer Lopez’s service, and to see and 
feel the outpouring of love and support. 
I saw right away that Officer Lopez left 
an indelible mark on Yavapai County. 
Beloved by his community, respected 
by those he served, and mourned deeply 
by his family and his colleagues, I saw 
right away that he was a wonderful 
person. 
As a former police officer and homi-
cide investigator, I know that police 
work is an incredibly dangerous profes-
sion. Any arrest can turn dangerous in 
an instant, putting officers and all in-
volved in jeopardy in a single moment. 
We must always keep our brave law 
enforcement officers and their families 
in our thoughts and in our prayers. 
Today, I extend my sincerest condo-
lences to Lushana Lopez and their two 
children, and to the men and women of 
the Yavapai County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment. 
f 
STATE OF OUR ECONOMY 
(Mr. SMUCKER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. 
SMUCKER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
well, here we are. Reports this morning 
show that we have been in a recession 
here in this country. Unfortunately, 
since coming into office, the Biden ad-
ministration has been in denial about 
the state of our economy. 
And I think our Minority Leader, Mr. 
MCCARTHY, just outlined, showed on 
the floor a little bit ago how the ad-
ministration has been talking about 
the threat of inflation. 
They initially promised that it would 
be transitory. Then chief of staff in-
sisted that inflation was only a high- 
class problem. And then President 
Biden, blaming everyone except him-
self for causing the record-high infla-
tion that we see today. 
With inflation at 9.1 percent; the Fed 
raising interest rates again; and now, 
two consecutive quarters of declining 
GDP, Americans are rightly concerned 
that our economy is now in a recession. 
It will be interesting to see the White 
House’s response because, up until now, 
instead of trying to solve the problem, 
the White House has, instead, in the 
previous few days, been trying to alter 
the definition of a recession. 
George Orwell warned that the gov-
ernment will one day tell you to reject 
the evidence of your eyes and ears. It is 
important that we identify the problem 
before we can solve it. 
REESE’S LAW 
(Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. 
KELLY 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to talk about 
Reese Hamsmith, an 18-month-old child 
who 
died 
due 
to 
complications 
2 
months after ingesting a button bat-
tery. This story has become more and 
more common with nearly 3,500 chil-
dren ingesting button and coin bat-
teries each year. 
Just under a year ago is when I first 
met with Reese’s mom, Trista. Trista’s 
story is heartbreaking, but she has 
turned her and her family’s grief into 
action. She approached my office with 
an idea for a bill so that other families 
are spared this experience. 
Reese’s Law requires the Consumer 
Product Safety Commission to create 
safety standards for products that con-
tain a button or coin batteries to pre-
vent accidental ingestion by children 
under 6 years old. 
I thank Trista for her fierce advocacy 
for continuing to share Reese’s story, 
and for helping make this bill become 
a reality. 
I am proud that this bipartisan bill 
passed the House yesterday and my 
colleagues voted to protect children 
and help save countless lives. 
f 
STATE OF THE ECONOMY 
(Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, 
this morning, the Commerce Depart-
ment announced that the economy 
shrank for the second quarter in a row. 
This 
means 
that 
under 
President 
Biden, we are now in a recession. And 
yet, the House is not acting respon-
sibly to help the American people. 
The Biden administration’s policies 
have led our country into one crisis 
after 
another: 
Inflation, 
high 
gas 
prices, soaring grocery prices, supply 
chain problems, recession, children left 
behind in school, a record number of 
deaths from overdoses, vaccine man-
dates, and people quitting the work-
force, and an overrun southern border 
with 500,000 people known to have got-
ten away in the past 10 months. 
Meanwhile, House Democrats have 
focused on extreme policies, allowing 
abortion up to the moment of birth, 
forcing taxpayers to pay for abortions, 
and attacking the due process and Sec-
ond Amendment rights of the Amer-
ican people. 
None of these policies will help hurt-
ing Michigan families and seniors who 
are paying an extra $729 a month be-
cause of Biden’s record inflation. 
When Republicans led the House, we 
had low inflation, affordable energy, 
and a strong economy. 
BUILDING TECHNOLOGICAL 
SUPREMACY 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, Taiwan, a country of less 
than 24 million people in East Asia, 
manufactures 92 percent of the world’s 
advanced computer chips. You can’t 
buy technological supremacy, but you 
can build it. 
Today, the House will vote to ap-
prove the CHIPS Act, which will make 
a $280 billion investment in the design 
and actual making of advanced com-
puter chips right here in America; $50 
billion for research and development 
and for the construction of chip manu-
facturing facilities in America. 
The bill also includes $10 billion to 
establish 20 regional hubs, regional 
centers of innovation. Buffalo, New 
York, is well-positioned to be one of 
those. 
I urge this House to approve the 
CHIPS Act, and the Commerce Depart-
ment to select Buffalo as one of the re-
gional hubs.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF DR. 
O’DELL OWENS 
(Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor and congratulate 
my good friend and mentor, Dr. O’Dell 
Owens, on his retirement. As an obste-
trician, Dr. Owens brought countless 
young Americans into the world. 
Dr. Owens served as chairman of the 
board at the University of Cincinnati. 
He was president of Cincinnati State 
University. He was the medical direc-
tor of the Cincinnati Health Depart-
ment, and he served as Hamilton Coun-
ty Coroner; all before spending 5 years 
as president and CEO of Interact for 
Health in Cincinnati. 
Through his everyday example, he 
has lived his motto to ‘‘help people 
help themselves.’’ 
Dr. Owens’ life is one devoted to a ca-
reer of helping people who need it 
most. He often reflects on his dad’s ad-
vice that ‘‘tomorrow is not promised;’’ 
therefore, it is necessary to make a dif-
ference today. 
Dr. Owens, you have made a dif-
ference in so many lives, mine in-
cluded. Dr. Owens, again, congratula-
tions on your well-deserved retirement. 
Yet, I look forward to seeing what you 
may do next.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7265 
July 28, 2022 
For the last 6 weeks, because of the 
relentless efforts of the White House 
and of Joe Biden to reduce gas prices, 
those gas prices have fallen every day 
for 6 weeks. That is because Democrats 
are focused on putting people over poli-
tics, and we want to lower costs, have 
better paying jobs, and safer commu-
nities. 
What are Republicans focused on? 
They want to end Social Security; 
they are attacking our democracy; and 
they want to criminalize women’s 
healthcare decisions. 
In fact, just last week, House Repub-
licans voted ‘‘no’’ on providing access 
to birth control pills. Let me just re-
peat that again. We are in the 21st cen-
tury, and House Republicans want gov-
ernment to ban birth control pills.

mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology to concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the House amendment to the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 4346. It pro-
vides 1 hour of debate equally divided 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Science, Space, and Technology. 
Finally, the rule provides standard 
floor recess instructions for the August 
district work period from August 1 to 
September 12. 
Madam Speaker, this rule provides 
for consideration of a historic package 
of long-overdue legislative actions that 
will strengthen our economy and re-
ignite our competitiveness on the glob-
al stage. 
Throughout our work in Congress, we 
have focused on fighting for and uplift-
ing families, on creating opportunity 
and setting our community on a path 
toward a brighter future. This historic 
investment will deliver on the promise 
of a better tomorrow. 
It means jobs, real jobs, that will 
keep families together and ensure our 
children 
can 
access 
the 
American 
Dream. 
It means lower costs for essential, ev-
eryday items that will lessen the bur-
den on families. 
It means America will strengthen its 
competitiveness against countries like 
China and reestablish its place as the 
global leader in innovation. 
It will reaffirm our leadership around 
the world by strengthening diplomacy, 
promoting human rights, and bol-
stering economic engagement. 
I am proud that this bill is a result of 
comprehensive bicameral and bipar-
tisan negotiations, which I had the 
privilege of participating in as a mem-
ber of the Conference Committee. 
America has always been known as 
the land of opportunity, creativity, and 
entrepreneurship. We are the Nation 
that took to the stars and landed a 
man on the Moon, the birthplace of 
transformational inventions like the 
internet, and home to some of the 
world’s greatest scientists. Techno-
logical advancement is in our DNA, 
and we need to continue fostering its 
long-term growth. That is why I am 
particularly pleased this legislation in-
cludes steps to enhance regional inno-
vation, which has long been one of my 
top priorities and opens the doors for 
limitless potential. 
Federal investment in regional inno-
vation hubs will uplift communities 
across the country that are already 
leading the way in high-tech advance-
ments, communities like my home of 
Rochester, which is already doing 
groundbreaking work in this field. 
No longer will Silicon Valley be the 
only area synonymous with innova-
tion. With this legislation, we are mak-
ing investments in collaboration across 
public, private, education, and civic 
sectors that will be game changers for 
communities across the country, trans-
forming underutilized cities into cru-
cibles of America’s global competitive-
ness. 
Furthermore, 
this 
legislation 
ad-
dresses our deep concern that America 
is losing its competitive edge in semi-
conductor manufacturing, a clear eco-
nomic and national security concern. 
Over the past few years, China has in-
vested more than $150 billion to build 
their domestic chip manufacturing ca-
pacity, while we have invested nothing. 
We have fallen behind. But not any-
more. 
The CHIPS and Science Act will bol-
ster our domestic supply of semi-
conductors, putting us back on pace to 
match China while reducing our reli-
ance on foreign supply chains and low-
ering costs for everyday families. 
This legislation harnesses the spirit 
of ingenuity that has always guided 
America and turns the page on a new 
chapter in our history, one that creates 
economic opportunity for communities 
across the country and ensures our Na-
tion is back on track as the global 
leader we have always been. 
I extend a heartfelt thank-you to all 
of my colleagues who have helped 
make this legislation a reality. It has 
been an honor to collaborate with so 
many leaders, particularly the Honor-
able 
Chairwoman 
JOHNSON
of 
the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee on regional innovation provi-
sions. 
As a member of the USICA-COM-
PETES conference process, I encoun-
tered a strong commitment from fellow 
conferees and staff to ensure this final 
package reflects the needs of the entire 
country and provides a meaningful 
path 
forward 
for 
innovation 
and 
growth.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7266 
July 28, 2022 
No legislation is perfect, but this 
package sends a clear message to the 
world that when it comes to our global 
competitiveness, we will set aside our 
differences and get the job done. 
Today, we are taking decisive action 
to 
ensure 
our 
leadership 
remains 
strong, our economy remains robust, 
and our future remains bright. 
Yesterday afternoon, this legislation 
received broad bipartisan support on 
the Senate floor, with 17 Republican 
Senators voting for final passage. I 
hope we see similar outcomes when it 
comes to the House floor. 
I encourage my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to join me in proudly 
supporting this important legislation. I 
look forward to seeing it passed in 
short order. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the distin-
guished gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MORELLE), my good friend, for yielding 
me the customary 30 minutes, and I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the rule before us 
today provides for consideration of the 
CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. After 
conference negotiations failed on a 
package to counter the malign actions 
of China, the Senate drafted this legis-
lation to send billions of taxpayer dol-
lars in the form of subsidies and tax 
credits to a single industry. 
Democrats’ reckless spending poli-
cies led to this record-high inflation 
that is crushing American families and 
small business. The government should 
not be spending hundreds of billions of 
dollars to provide subsidies benefiting 
one industry. 
This legislation comes to the House 
just 1 day after Senate Democrats an-
nounced a deal to tax American manu-
facturers and energy producers, which 
will increase the cost to American fam-
ilies and worsen our supply chain cri-
sis. 
They also want to hire 87,000 new IRS 
agents, and let’s be honest about this. 
Those agents will do nothing more 
than target American families and 
small businesses. 
They also want to spend $369 billion 
on their radical, far-left, Green New 
Deal agenda. There can be no doubt 
that this latest iteration of Biden’s 
build back broke agenda will cause in-
flation to skyrocket even further. 
The Biden administration is deflect-
ing on our Nation’s recession. They are 
classifying Biden’s economic crisis as a 
‘‘transition’’ to slower growth. While 
they are doubling down on their disas-
trous policies, they are devastating ev-
eryday Americans. 
It is time my colleagues across the 
aisle 
abandon 
their 
socialist 
pipe 
dream and actually work with Repub-
licans to get our economy back on 
track. 
Madam Speaker, I, therefore, urge 
my colleagues to oppose this rule, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me just reflect 
on what my good friend and colleague 
on the Rules Committee said about a 
single industry. It is hard to imagine 
any industry in the United States—in 
the world, in fact—that doesn’t utilize 
semiconductor chips. It is in every-
thing. Chips run everything. 
Whether it is your cell phone, your 
laptop, or your automobile, it really 
doesn’t matter. Children’s toys have 
chips in them. The fact is, we have lost 
our competitive edge. That is what this 
is all about. This affects industry in 
the United States. 
Take, for example, General Motors 
announcing they have 95,000 auto-
mobiles awaiting chips. Do you want to 
increase the supply of goods to people 
and help bring down inflation? This is 
about increasing the supply of goods 
all over the United States in every sin-
gle industry. 
In my home in Rochester, New York, 
where we specialize in optics, centuries 
of optics and photonic integrated cir-
cuits, everything is involved with 
chips. We can no longer wait. 
By the way, in addition to our eco-
nomic security, our national security 
depends on this. If you want to not 
only compete with China economically 
but from a national security and de-
fense perspective, we must do this. 
This isn’t about a single industry; it 
is about every industry. 
It is like saying water is used to 
drink; water is in everything. We could 
not be clearer about this. This is about 
our competitiveness on every level, and 
it is about the future. 
It is about our children. It is about 
our grandchildren. It is about what 
kind of country we want to have and 
what kind of economy we want to have. 
Are we going to be in a position to de-
fend the United States’ democracy and 
our interests around the world? 
I appreciate my friend’s comments, 
but I have to say it would be narrow- 
minded to look at this and simply say 
it affects the semiconductor industry 
only. It affects everything. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ROSS), my very good friend and 
another distinguished member of the 
Rules Committee. 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the CHIPS and 
Science Act. Our Nation has long been 
a global leader in science and tech-
nology, but we cannot afford to take 
that position for granted. 
Our global standing rests not just on 
the ingenuity of our people but also on 
our government’s bipartisan commit-
ment to supporting innovation. 
At this moment of unprecedented 
international competition, we urgently 
need an unprecedented investment in 
the groundbreaking research that pow-
ers America’s economic growth. That 
is why the CHIPS and Science Act is so 
timely and so important. 
In addition to bolstering domestic 
production 
of 
semiconductors, 
this 
landmark legislation will authorize 
more than $81 billion for the National 
Science Foundation. 
Crucially, the bill also funds research 
that will yield the cutting-edge clean 
energy technologies of tomorrow, cut-
ting carbon emissions and helping com-
bat global climate change. 
Madam Speaker, my district includes 
much of the Research Triangle, our Na-
tion’s largest research park, which is 
home to hundreds of companies break-
ing new ground in medicine, energy, 
telecommunications, and more. 
We are also proud of our leading re-
search universities like N.C. State Uni-
versity, HBCUs like Shaw and Saint 
Augustine’s, and our State’s largest 
community college, Wake Tech, and we 
have a women’s college specializing in 
STEM, Meredith College. 
Our investments in public-private 
partnerships afforded by the CHIPS 
and Science Act will provide these 
North Carolina-based companies and 
educational institutions with unprece-
dented funding and research support. 
Companies in my district, particu-
larly startups, have struggled to cope 
with the consequences of the global 
semiconductor shortage. To meet that 
need, this bill includes more than $50 
billion in chips funding, which will 
mitigate current semiconductor supply 
chain concerns, incentivize domestic 
production, and prevent another chips 
crisis in the future. 
I am also pleased that this package 
includes several bipartisan bills I led 
with members of the Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee, including 
the Energizing Technology Transfer 
Act, a version of the NSF Technology 
Research Institutes Act, and the Na-
tional Science and Technology Strat-
egy Act. 
These bills will help facilitate the 
commercial application of clean energy 
technologies by universities and pri-
vate companies, the development of a 
national science and technology strat-
egy, and investment in research and 
traineeship programs for graduate stu-
dents. 
The CHIPS and Science Act embodies 
the investment needed to empower in-
novation in North Carolina’s Second 
District and across the United States. I 
support the rule and the underlying 
bill. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t disagree that 
these chips are important to the U.S. 
economy and many manufacturers. 
What I take issue with is the fact that 
we are putting even more money, bil-
lions of dollars, into an economy that 
is already suffering from record-high 
inflation. 
It is unsettled whether this will even 
make a difference. It can be argued 
that chips were already going to come 
back anyhow, and it is not just me say-
ing it. I have an article right here from

The Economist, not exactly a right-
wing publication. It was published on 
10 July of this year. ‘‘When the chips 
are way down: After a turbocharged 
boom, are chipmakers in for a supersize 
bust?’’ That is the headline. 
It goes on, saying: ‘‘Surging supply 
and softening demand are bringing the 
pandemic’s superstar industry back to 
Earth.’’ 
My question is: If this industry is al-
ready coming back, if it is already as 
important as we think it is, why do we 
need to inject billions of dollars into 
the economy that is just going to fur-
ther the economic crisis we are already 
in? 
I know my colleague from North 
Carolina was talking about how to spur 
research and development. I can tell 
you how to do it: You cut taxes. You 
cut regulations. 
If you look at the TCJA, this was a 
huge win for U.S. research and invest-
ment: 25 percent higher than in the 
years prior, reaching an all-time high 
in 2019 of $584 billion and 3 percent of 
GDP. 
If you want to stimulate the econ-
omy, you can do it by reducing taxes 
and reducing regulation, not by pick-
ing winners and losers. 
To talk more about this point, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from the 
great State of Texas (Mr. BURGESS), my 
good friend and fellow Rules Com-
mittee member. 
b 1115 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, this 
morning we are here to talk about the 
rule for the CHIPS Act to provide $76 
billion for semiconductor manufac-
turing and authorizing $200 billion over 
10 years for research and innovation 
programs. 
Now, according to a long-term budget 
outlook released by the Congressional 
Budget Office just yesterday, our na-
tional debt sits at $24 trillion and will 
rise to $138 trillion over the next three 
decades. That is equivalent to $370,000 
for every man, woman, and child in the 
United States. Our mandatory spend-
ing over the same period would grow 
from just over $4 trillion per year to 
over $18 trillion per year. The CHIPS 
Act includes billions in new mandatory 
spending and billions more that is au-
thorized for appropriation. 
We are experiencing the highest in-
flation in 40 years with multiple inter-
est rate hikes. It has been widely re-
ported that the Federal Reserve hiked 
interest rates again and with the state-
ment that they have no choice but to 
try to slow the economy in order to 
tame this inflationary pressure. 
And then here is the ironic part of all 
that, the CHIPS bill also is the key 
that unlocks the door for getting the 
long-stalled Build Back Better Act 
going over in the United States Senate. 
And what does that do? 
It provides billions of additional dol-
lars of stimulus spending in the econ-
omy. But the Federal Reserve said they 
have no choice but to slow the econ-
omy. 
So which is it? Is it a stimulant or a 
depressant? 
As a medical professional, I will tell 
you, if you combine those two activi-
ties, you are going to end up with 
something that is just goofy. But then 
on top of that, there are tax increases 
at a time of recession. 
Even the Obama administration in 
2009 and 2010 said, we can’t undo the 
Bush tax cuts, we have got to continue 
the Bush tax cuts that they had long 
hoped to undo because they could not 
raise taxes during a recession. And yet 
now we have the other body poised, ba-
sically, with their Green New Deal to 
tax America back into the stone age. 
I agree that semiconductors are a 
critical component of likely everything 
we use, but we cannot put our fiscal fu-
ture in further jeopardy, especially 
when this funding will benefit one spe-
cific industry. I am also concerned that 
the time required to ramp up the semi-
conductor production will be late in 
trying to alleviate current supply 
chain constraints. As my friend from 
Pennsylvania just pointed out, when 
this industry self-corrects, the likeli-
hood is there will be too many. 
Rather than provide funding to large 
corporations, many of whom are al-
ready undertaking significant develop-
ment efforts, let’s incentivize competi-
tiveness in all industries and continue 
to promote research and development 
and not raise taxes during a recession. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I am a little sur-
prised by the conversation here, it is as 
though we don’t recognize the impor-
tance of semiconductors and the entire 
semiconductor supply chain to lit-
erally every activity we are involved 
in. Whether transportation, as I have 
already mentioned, or communications 
or medical devices or our satellite 
technology, literally every single thing 
we do depends on it. 
The notion that we should somehow 
stand pat and allow other nations to 
invest and to build their supply chains 
to me is hard to accept, hard to under-
stand, hard to process. If we do nothing 
over the next decade, China will be pro-
ducing about 40 percent of semicon-
ductor chips worldwide, the United 
States about 6 percent. If we want to 
put our reliance in the hands of foreign 
suppliers and foreign supply chains, I 
guess we can do nothing. But we need 
to invest, and that is why this bill is 
critical. That is why I suspect it re-
ceived the support of 17 Republican 
Senators on the Senate floor yester-
day. This is critical. 
As I said earlier, China is investing 
$150 billion in their semiconductor sup-
ply chain, and this is not just chips; it 
is chips, it is substrates, it is pack-
aging, it is assembly. It is the whole 
thing. Anytime there is a gap in a sup-
ply chain, we rely on those who fill 
that gap for us. 
Do we want to be in a position where 
our economic fortunes are dependent 
on foreign competitors for a critical 
part of our supply chain? 
Do we want to put our national secu-
rity in jeopardy because those things 
which we need to be safe and secure are 
dependent upon foreign supply chains? 
I don’t think so. I don’t think that is 
what the American public wants. And, 
frankly, I am glad to have this debate 
because I think it shows a divide. I 
think it shows a contrast between what 
we want to do to invest in not only this 
generation but next generations. 
There are also a couple of other ob-
servations I will make. One is about 
just market forces and just allowing 
things to happen according to the mar-
ket. While working on this bill—I 
talked a lot earlier, and I will continue 
to talk about regional innovation, but 
I also want to talk about Federal in-
vestment, two points. 
The first I would make is: R&D in-
vestment by the United States Govern-
ment has fallen to 0.61 percent of U.S. 
GDP. That is the lowest mark since the 
1950s. At one point we were investing 
nearly 2 percent of GDP in research 
and development. 
What came out of things like our in-
vestments in the space program are 
material sciences and advances, ad-
vances 
in 
telecommunications, 
ad-
vances in weather satellites, advances 
in so many different things, even fuel 
cell development. All those things 
came out of an R&D investment which 
we haven’t kept pace with. 
We talk about our competitiveness 
with China. This is vital to our na-
tional interest. I can’t think of many 
things that are more vital to our na-
tional interest over the next several 
decades. 
When you look at where we are mak-
ing those investments, right now, if 
you are privileged to live in one of the 
five innovation hubs—such as Boston; 
the Silicon Valley; in Seattle, Wash-
ington; in Austin, Texas—those areas 
account for about 90 percent of private 
investment, and venture capitalists 
will spend in those areas. 
But what about the rest of the coun-
try? 
I live in a place, Rochester, New 
York, which is home to the Rochester 
Institute of Technology and the Uni-
versity of Rochester, both great re-
search facilities. There was a book re-
cently written, ‘‘Jump-Starting Amer-
ica’’ by Simon Johnson and Jonathan 
Gruber, two MIT economists. They 
rated 130 different communities across 
the country that are falling behind, de-
spite the fact that they have great in-
novation ecosystems, but they lack in-
vestment. 
The public investment which we are 
talking about making through our re-
gional innovation hubs will drive pri-
vate investment because private in-
vestment will partner with the invest-
ments being made by the U.S. Govern-
ment in our innovation, in our entre-
preneurship, in advancing our interests 
for the long term. 
We have to do this. This isn’t some-
thing that we could decide to wait a

July 28, 2022 
year or two years. This is an invest-
ment we must make now. We have fall-
en behind, and we can no longer afford 
to fall further behind. 
Our economic interests, our national 
security interests are intimately tied 
together, and that is why this legisla-
tion is so vital, and that is why I hope 
we will have strong bipartisan support 
when the bill comes to the floor. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, just a point of clari-
fication. This is just an authorization. 
We will still wait a year anyhow to ap-
propriate these funds, so trying to act 
like we have a gun to our head right 
now and this is a do-or-die moment is 
completely illusory. Again, this is just 
an authorization. 
Additionally, I agree with my friend 
from New York on two points. Number 
one, we have got to be competitive 
with China. 
Number 
two, 
the 
semiconductor 
chips are important for the economy. 
But the way to compete with China 
is not to emulate the policies of a Com-
munist police state. The way to com-
pete with China is to unleash the 
American economy, to get back to our 
Western roots of free-market cap-
italism. If we want to bring more busi-
nesses onshore, if we want to fix our 
supply chain crisis, we can start by re-
ducing 
the 
burdensome regulations 
that are crippling American businesses. 
We can reduce our income tax and our 
corporate income tax to make us more 
competitive globally, and we can do 
something to make sure we have cheap, 
reliable, abundant energy resources, 
such as exploiting our natural gas re-
serves and perhaps investing in nuclear 
power. 
But to sit here and say that we are 
going to compete with China by doing 
what the Chinese do and having some 
bureaucratic monster in D.C. pick win-
ners and losers for a particular indus-
try is not a winning proposition. 
What will beat China and keep us 
competitive with China is getting back 
to what made this country great in the 
first place, and again that is free-mar-
ket capitalism. 
Let’s talk about inflation because, 
again, this is going to put billions of 
dollars into the economy, which will 
make this situation worse. Americans 
are facing the highest inflation in over 
40 years. This is literally the worst in-
flation in my lifetime. This morning 
we learned that GDP has decreased for 
a second quarter in a row. 
Yet, the Treasury Secretary wants to 
downplay Biden’s economic crisis by 
redefining recession, which for decades 
recession has been defined as two quar-
ters of negative economic growth. In-
stead, Secretary Yellen and the leftists 
across the aisle want to play Orwellian 
and change the definition to ‘‘a period 
of transition.’’ Even the extreme lib-
eral think tank, The Brookings Insti-
tution, acknowledged we are in a reces-
sion, but it seems, again, my col-
leagues across the aisle have forgotten 
basic economics. 
House Republicans want to set the 
record straight. That is why if we de-
feat the previous question, I will per-
sonally offer an amendment to the rule 
to immediately consider House Resolu-
tion 1290, a resolution affirming the 
longstanding definition of a recession. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD
along 
with any extraneous materials imme-
diately prior to the vote on the pre-
vious question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
LEE of Nevada). Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT), my good friend and the 
sponsor of this resolution, to explain 
the amendment. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I have got to tell you, being on the 
Ways and Means Committee and never 
actually engaging in some of your 
Rules debate, you guys are really po-
lite with each other. 
But here’s a simple question: What 
are the two times in life you think you 
know everything? 
When you turn 13 years old and the 
day after you get elected to Congress. 
I am going to argue the arrogance of 
this place right now doing a piece of 
legislation like this. Why is this bill, 
the underlying bill, the underlying rule 
here so dangerous? And why this reso-
lution actually fits this. 
Basically, the underlying bill is in-
dustrial policy. Let’s face it, some of 
the scoring is saying this is $400 bil-
lion, and it is the politicization func-
tionally of a category of incredibly im-
portant industry, grants that you saw 
the President a couple days ago talk 
about—now you are going to have to 
come in front of me. 
Do you understand how dangerous 
that is for an economy? That arrogance 
of the political class thinking you un-
derstand what the next disruption is. 
The controlling of intellect, the con-
trolling of taking risk. 
If you actually gave a darn about 
American competitiveness, of where 
chips—and who knows, quantum, and 
all the other possibilities of data man-
agement, data movement, of proc-
essing—are going, you would fix the 
Tax Code, you would fix the regulatory 
code. 
If you care about China, deal with 
the made-in-America tax, the fact that 
they refund the VAT; and when we ex-
port, they put the VAT back on, and it 
makes us not competitive. 
You also now have to deal with the 
reality, when The Economist is writing 
articles that we are heading toward a 
glut of chips. Look, I am from Arizona. 
On the side of my district, I have a $16 
billion investment from Taiwan Semi-
conductor. Down the street I have 
Intel, I think they are spending $18 bil-
lion. It is coming. 
But the brain trust around here is we 
are going to do industrial policy. We 
are going to control the money. It will 
be great for fund-raising. And the con-
cept, once again, is we have politicized 
everything. Think of now the debate 
we have had the last couple days, is 
two quarters of negative GDP, well, 
that is not a recession. Okay, tech-
nically it might not be because the def-
inition of recession now is a committee 
that is politicized. 
Could we at least have some bench-
marks here in Congress, here in Wash-
ington that we know what the rules 
are? I don’t mean your type of rules. I 
mean the rules for society, the rules 
for tax policy, the rules for how we al-
locate capital, because you are offering 
right now functionally $400 billion of 
subsidies, controls, management, and 
industrial policy, government. 
Why don’t you just nationalize the 
chip industry because you are pretty 
much heading that direction. 
This is a simple amendment. In some 
ways, it is actually very symbolic of we 
can’t even agree anymore on what a re-
cession is. 
Okay, fine. Let’s just make it a rule 
instead of making it a committee of in-
dividuals that get to express their 
opinion and their feelings. 
I would love to actually offer some-
thing more complex. Maybe we should 
go back to the old misery index debates 
of how many people can’t afford living 
anymore. You do realize the inflation 
from just the last 12 months, my con-
stituents—I represent the highest in-
flation in the Nation—get to work 
about 6 weeks without compensation. 
The purchasing power of their lives has 
crashed so much, they now work a 
month-and-a-half for free. 
b 1130 
These are the brilliant policies this 
place has brought. It is time we actu-
ally start to set some benchmarks on 
what the rules are. 
Simple amendment. Just saying, hey, 
we will call it a recession when we have 
two consecutive quarters, and we can 
stop the politicization of everything 
here in Washington. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I will admit that I am a little mys-
tified about what I am hearing here, so 
let me try to unpack a lot of what I 
just heard. 
In the first instance, a number of my 
colleagues have repeatedly suggested 
that regular order in the House is for 
the authorization of legislation and 
then appropriators identify how much 
money can be spent on those things au-
thorized under law. 
That is exactly what we are doing 
here today. We are authorizing much 
under the CHIPS legislation. That is 
the way we do regular order. It is iden-
tifying those things that we authorize

and then identifying the dollars nec-
essary to meet that authorization. 
But let me just read from the actual 
report on the bill: Division A, CHIPS 
Act of 2022, Section 101, Short Title: 
This Act may be cited as the CHIPS 
Act of 2022. Section 102, Creating Help-
ful Incentives to Produce Semiconduc-
tors for America Fund, the CHIPS 
fund. In order to support the rapid im-
plementation of the semiconductor 
provisions included in the fiscal year 
2021 National Defense Authorization 
Act, the NDAA, this division would 
provide $52.7 billion in emergency sup-
plemental appropriations. 
This bill has nearly $53 billion in-
cluded in it, $50 billion allocated over 5 
years for the CHIPS for America Fund. 
I could go on and list it, but this is 
exactly what we are talking about: Au-
thorization to move forward over the 
next several years to strengthen Amer-
ican competitiveness in the world. 
By the way, it is not just all of the 
industries I talked about. Try to order 
a refrigerator without a chip in it or a 
microwave oven or a dishwasher or a 
TV or a laptop or a cell phone or—I 
could go on and on all day. There isn’t 
a consumer device, there is not an elec-
tronic device—even farm equipment. 
Everything we use has chips in it. We 
are falling behind the Chinese and oth-
ers, and we are relying on foreign in-
vestment and foreign supply chain. 
I can’t imagine something more 
American than passing this bill. This is 
vital to our national interest. This is 
one of the most vital things we will do. 
So we are following in the way that 
we are supposed to: authorization, ap-
propriation. But there are emergency 
appropriations of over $50 billion to 
move not just one industry forward, 
but to move all industries forward, to 
move our economic and our national 
security interests forward together. 
By the way, just so if people tune in 
and wonder, What is this all about? Let 
me just say all the things I just men-
tioned, $50 billion in emergency appro-
priations, the desire and the need and 
the will of the American people, as rep-
resented by the Senate and the House, 
to move forward on economic and na-
tional security interests. 
We should put that all aside, my 
friends are suggesting, and don’t do 
any of that today. So we are not going 
to authorize; we are not going to spend 
money; we are not going to move our-
selves forward from an economic secu-
rity and a national security perspec-
tive. 
This is what they would like us to do 
instead, and I am reading from their 
bill, the thing they just said we should 
do instead of doing all the things I just 
mentioned: resolve that it is the sense 
of the House of Representatives that 
two consecutive quarters of negative 
growth in gross domestic product con-
stitutes a recession. That is what they 
would like to do. 
We would like to move America for-
ward. We would like to build a supply 
chain that works for all Americans. We 
want to make sure our economy is 
strong now and in the future. We want 
to make sure our national defense is 
strong, that the American public is 
protected, that democracy is protected 
across the world. And that is what we 
are doing. That is what our partners in 
the Senate are doing. They want to de-
fine what a recession is. That is their 
plan. 
I would ask America: Should we stop 
what we are doing? Should we put an 
end to our desire to make sure we are 
competitive on the world stage? Should 
we not protect America’s economic in-
terests? Should we not protect Amer-
ica’s national security interests? And 
we should define in the House of Rep-
resentatives what a recession is? That 
is what we want to do? That is their 
plan? 
I think most Americans watching 
would be scratching their heads. I 
think they would wonder why is it peo-
ple don’t want to make us competitive 
here in the House of Representatives. 
Well, we do. The majority—and I sus-
pect a fair number of their colleagues 
are going to vote for this, too, because 
they know it is good for America, and 
they know it is good for the future, for 
not only my generation, but my chil-
dren’s generation, my grandchildren’s 
generation, and generations to come. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Just to clarify, this is not an either/ 
or choice here. If we defeat the pre-
vious question, we can consider the res-
olution of my good friend from Arizona 
to actually define recession, and then 
we can take up the underlying bill. 
Again, this is a false choice saying it is 
one or the other. We can do both. 
People may ask, Why is it necessary 
to define recession? It is necessary be-
cause the party across the aisle are 
trying to redefine recession. But I 
shouldn’t be surprised. Because remem-
ber, this is the same party that tried to 
tell us that women are now known as 
birthing people. It is the party that all 
during the summer of 2020 told us that 
violent rioting and looting was mostly 
peaceful protesting. Now they are try-
ing to tell us that a recession, which 
has been defined for decades as two 
consecutive quarters of negative GDP 
growth, that that is now called a 
transitionary period. 
So it is an absolute necessity that we 
define recession so that we have clarity 
in language. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. ROD-
NEY DAVIS), my good friend and the 
ranking member on the Committee on 
House Administration. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my good 
friend Mr. RESCHENTHALER from Penn-
sylvania for yielding. He is right that 
it 
is 
disinformation. 
It 
is 
disinformation. We should defeat the 
previous question so that we can go 
back to what defined a recession and 
what has defined a recession for dec-
ades. 
Democrats have to stop playing 
games, playing games with misin-
formation and disinformation. Now, we 
have got another game being played 
with this rule today. 
This is a rule, as my good friend from 
New York talked about, that is going 
to allow a bill to come to the floor that 
has some very good bipartisan provi-
sions. I think many Republicans would 
support a lot of the provisions in this 
CHIPS bill. 
The problem is, why in the world 
does the majority have to continue to 
play games instead of actually working 
with us and doing anything in a bipar-
tisan manner? 
Tucked into this rule is a provision 
that will completely eviscerate the in-
tent of a rule that was negotiated in a 
bipartisan way by Republicans and 
Democrats that if a Member of Con-
gress was able to secure 290 cosponsors 
on a bill, he or she would have then 
been given the right, as a Member of 
this institution, to have that bill de-
bated and voted on, on the floor of the 
House of Representatives. 
I remember Democrats and Repub-
licans standing up and touting this 
provision, that this is going to bring 
power back to every Member of Con-
gress. Until today—until today when 
the Rules Committee decides to turn 
this provision off, to deny the 294 co-
sponsors of the Social Security Fair-
ness Act that is in place because all 294 
of us want fairness for our retired 
teachers, our retired firefighters, and 
our retired police officers. They are 
turning off this rule for one reason and 
one reason only, to not have a vote on 
the floor like they promised us they 
would do. 
We followed their rules. And what did 
Democrats do? They changed the rules 
in the process. 
Do you want Republicans to vote for 
legislation in a bipartisan way when 
you play games like this? Well, don’t 
be surprised when there are a lot of 
noes popping up on the board today for 
a piece of legislation that I think a lot 
of Republicans would normally sup-
port. 
It is games like this that hurt the re-
tirees the most. Democrats for decades 
have promised retired teachers, fire-
fighters, police officers, and other pub-
lic employees—they promised those in-
dividuals that they would do some-
thing to fix these egregious provisions, 
the Government Pension Offset and the 
Windfall Elimination Provision in the 
Social Security Code. 
This is their shot—this is your shot, 
Madam Speaker, to get the major-
ity—— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute 
to the gentleman from Illinois. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, this is the majority’s

shot to live up to the promises the 
Democrats have made for decades to 
those who have been begging for a solu-
tion. All you have got to do is take this 
rule back, remove this turn-off provi-
sion, allow the consensus calendar to 
continue as it was intended to continue 
when this rule change was negotiated. 
If I was a bipartisan member of the 
Problem Solvers Caucus, I would be 
coming to the floor screaming. What I 
want to do is I want every single co-
sponsor of H.R. 82, the Social Security 
Fairness Act, to consider—all 293 oth-
ers besides me—I want you to consider 
voting against this rule. Because if 
they can turn this off and they can 
change the rules midgame, then why 
celebrate a bipartisan success story 
that was put in place in 2019? Stop 
playing politics. 
Madam Speaker, Members of the ma-
jority, quit playing games, vote down 
this rule, and change this provision. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I do worry sometimes that the public 
sometimes doesn’t understand what is 
being said here. It is curious that my 
distinguished friend, the gentleman 
from Illinois, would scream about the 
consensus calendar. 
Let me just be clear, folks back 
home. We created the consensus cal-
endar. It didn’t exist in the past. The 
Democrats created it to try to create 
more bipartisanship. What we are 
doing here is simply pausing, as we 
have done on both sides when both 
sides were in the majority—pausing 
during the August district work period. 
This is something that I just find fas-
cinating. We didn’t even have a con-
sensus calendar when Republicans were 
in charge. We are pausing it for the 
next 6 weeks. I appreciate the distin-
guished gentleman, but I want to as-
sure the American public that what 
they should be focused on is the work 
we should be doing today, the work 
that 
is 
actually 
getting 
done 
to 
strengthen our resolve around the 
world, to strengthen our economic po-
sition, to build jobs for families across 
America, to aid consumer electronics 
and business electronics, and all the 
things that we want to do around quan-
tum computing and quantum commu-
nications, and taking American inge-
nuity, American innovation, which has 
been the hallmark of our growth as a 
Nation for two centuries, and doubling 
down and saying we are not going to 
stand aside and let others take a lead-
ership position in this world. 
America is going to stand up. We are 
going to do what we have always done. 
We are going to invest in smart people; 
we are going to build our economic fu-
ture; and we are going to build our na-
tional security future. It starts here 
today. That is what we should keep our 
eyes on. 
Everyone should pay attention. This 
is what we are doing. I am expecting 
and hoping that we are going to have a 
substantially bipartisan vote on this 
bill when it comes to the floor as it did 
in the Senate just yesterday. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
RODNEY 
DAVIS) for the purpose of a rebuttal. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. 
Madam Speaker, I have the utmost re-
spect for my friend and colleague from 
New York, but he is dead wrong in the 
information and advice that he got 
from the Committee on Rules. 
The sheer fact that this so-called 
turn-off provision is nonchalantly just 
used as—well, it wasn’t part of the con-
sensus process, but let’s pound our 
chest and say we created the consensus 
calendar process to begin with, so we 
are great. Well, when you disrupt the 
consensus process, you are not great. 
You are actually changing the rules 
midgame. 
Really, here is the kicker: There is 
talk about us having to come back to 
do a few votes while we are in the 
midst of August. The way this rule is 
written, those days won’t even count 
toward the consensus calendar. 
Rest assured, there is no other reason 
that the Democrats and the majority 
on the Committee on Rules are doing 
this than to stop the progress of actu-
ally addressing the Social Security 
Fairness Act. 
We have 294 cosponsors. We played by 
the rules. Democrats changed the rules 
midgame. And you trust this majority 
to actually put a bill together that is 
going to stop China from dominating 
the chip production industry in the 
globe when they play games like this? 
That is what the American people are 
sick and tired of. That is why that is 
an outgoing majority. That is why we 
are going to have a new majority. It is 
games like this that have to stop being 
played when you talk about bipartisan-
ship, but you don’t actually govern in a 
bipartisan way. 
b 1145 
Today is another shining example of 
that. Again, 294 cosponsors. We play by 
your rules, we play by the majority’s 
provisions, and you change the rules 
midgame. I certainly hope our umpires 
tonight at the Congressional Baseball 
Game are better at actually codifying 
the rules that exist. 
Mr. 
MORELLE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while I have just a moment, I want to 
share with those who tuned in some 
comments about the underlying bill for 
this rule. ‘‘This funding will help kick- 
start domestic production of these 
semiconductors in a way that will pre-
vent a vulnerability of our supply 
chain . . .’’ ‘‘One other benefit to this 
bill is that this bill could create rough-
ly 185,000 jobs every year as these new 
facilities are constructed.’’ That was 
said by JOHN CORNYN from Texas yes-
terday on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
From ROY BLUNT, a Republican Sen-
ator from Missouri said: ‘‘This bill in-
cludes targeted investments in techno-
logical 
development 
and 
manufac-
turing that will strengthen our posi-
tion in a global economy. The bill ex-
pands the successful Manufacturing 
U.S.A. program by creating new inno-
vation hubs and helps ensure we have 
the right Federal policy in place to 
support the research and development 
of emerging technologies. I was proud 
to be a part of this effort, and I urge 
our House colleagues to get this bill to 
the President’s desk.’’ 
SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO, a Republican 
from West Virginia said this: ‘‘America 
can never be replaced as the global eco-
nomic and innovation leader. Winning 
the future means making the necessary 
investments to address issues like the 
microchip shortage, prepare the next 
generation of workers in science and 
technology fields, and keep up with our 
competitors, including China. This leg-
islation not only bets on American in-
genuity, but it also authorizes funding 
that can be utilized by our institutions 
of higher education . . .’’ 
How about TODD YOUNG, a Repub-
lican from Indiana: ‘‘It’s time to go on 
the offensive, and that is exactly what 
this legislation, which has gone by 
many names—from the Endless Fron-
tier Act to the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act to CHIPS-Plus—will 
do . . .’’ ‘‘This bill will unleash private 
sector innovation while significantly 
boosting Federal national security in-
vestments. It’s been a long journey to 
get to this point, but history will show 
that by passing this bill, we are con-
fronting the challenges of today and 
building a prosperous and secure to-
morrow for all Americans.’’ 
ROB
PORTMAN, a Republican from 
Ohio: ‘‘Today’s passage of the CHIPS 
Act is critical in the effort to bring 
semiconductor manufacturing back to 
the United States, protect our national 
security, and create thousands of high- 
paying jobs in Ohio. I was proud to help 
lead efforts in the Senate to pass this 
legislation and ensure that Intel’s 
planned semiconductor plant in central 
Ohio remains on track and reaches its 
full potential. I urge the House to act 
quick on this bipartisan legislation so 
the President can sign it into law, and 
I 
look 
forward 
to 
attending 
the 
groundbreaking 
for 
this 
trans-
formational project in the coming 
months.’’ 
The reviews keep coming, and they 
are all positive. We have got to move 
this today in the House. We have got to 
get it to the President’s desk. We have 
not a moment to lose in the race for 
America’s future and to make sure 
that we are secure for generations to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, my good friend from 
New York was talking about jobs and 
the promise of more jobs with this act. 
We have heard this before. The Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. We sat here and de-
bated that, and we were told by the

leftists across the aisle that this was 
going to create 4 million new jobs. You 
know what didn’t happen? We didn’t 
create 4 million new jobs. And that is 
not me saying that. That is a study 
from the American Enterprise Insti-
tute, which found that the American 
Rescue Plan failed to create any of the 
4 million new jobs that Big Govern-
ment Democrats had promised. 
While we are talking about stats and 
figures, let’s put a real cost to the in-
flation and the pain that is being in-
flicted on the American people by in-
jecting billions of dollars into the 
economy. So let’s put real numbers on 
it. Inflation will cost the average 
American household more than $6,000 a 
year. That is so high that if you have 
had a constant salary for the last year, 
you have essentially worked for more 
than a month without pay. 
So, let me ask this: If you are sitting 
here watching at home, could you take 
one paycheck from this year, one pay-
check, and just throw it out the win-
dow? Probably not. 
Now, if you are part of the coastal 
elite and the woke, yuppie, Zoom class 
that is the base of the Democratic 
Party, you might be able to afford 
that. You might just go to two Pilates 
classes a week instead of four. You 
may not take that second trip to Eu-
rope. You may scale back at Whole 
Foods. You have that luxury if you are 
part of the woke Democratic base. But 
if you are somebody in Pittsburgh who 
is a retired steel worker that is on a 
fixed income, this hurts you. You don’t 
have that disposable income. If you are 
a natural gas driller in Oklahoma that 
has to drive to a drill site every day to 
actually produce something, you have 
to fill your tank with gas. You don’t 
have the option to sit at home and pre-
tend you are working on Zoom. If you 
are a woman that has to drive, for ex-
ample, to a diner to work a shift, you 
don’t have the luxury of not doing 
that. You have to bear the burden of 
the inflation; again, the inflation that 
is being caused by the radical left poli-
cies of the Democratic Party. 
Yet, despite this real economic pain, 
Democrats continue to want to put bil-
lions of dollars in the economy, bil-
lions in corporate handouts. They want 
to undo Republican tax cuts and poli-
cies that actually led to the lowest un-
employment rates we have had in 50 
years. 
So, rather than forcing Americans to 
pay for their radical socialist agenda, 
my colleagues across the aisle should 
use the time to work with Republicans 
on policies that American families will 
benefit from and allow American com-
panies to actually compete in a global 
economy. And we can do that all sim-
ply by reducing regulation and reduc-
ing taxation. And how about we un-
leash our domestic energy supply? 
So I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
on the previous question and ‘‘no’’ on 
the rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I thank my great friend and col-
league for the opportunity to engage in 
a thoughtful conversation about issues 
where we may agree and we may dis-
agree, but I always appreciate him. 
I would just note, though, that all 
the conversations I have had over the 
last many, many months about Amer-
ican competitiveness has largely been 
with my chamber of commerce, with 
business leaders, CEOs of companies 
who are desperate that we continue to 
move forward in repairing the chal-
lenges of our microelectronic supply 
chain. I haven’t heard from any Social-
ists about it. They may have different 
communication with people, but I have 
heard from the business community; I 
have heard from economic drivers; I 
have heard from innovators; I have 
heard from entrepreneurs about the 
need to make this go. 
Madam Speaker, I want to, first of 
all, thank my colleagues who have spo-
ken in support of the rule. I want to 
thank those who have put this bill be-
fore us. Support for this rule showcases 
a commitment to American leadership 
in research, manufacturing, and inno-
vation for decades to come. It show-
cases a commitment to lowering costs 
for families, creating job opportunities, 
and building long-term economic sta-
bility that will uplift families across 
this country. It showcases a commit-
ment to investing in regional innova-
tion and leveraging the significant un-
tapped potential that so many commu-
nities hold, including my own in Roch-
ester, New York. 
We can’t afford to wait any longer to 
make these critical investments. We 
must join our colleagues in the Senate 
and show the American people we are 
committed to taking on China and re-
establishing our place on the global 
stage as a force to be reckoned with. 
This is a pivotal moment in our Na-
tion’s history. We must meet it head- 
on and deliver investments that will 
ensure every family in every commu-
nity has the opportunity to achieve the 
American Dream. This legislation will 
do just that. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the rule and the previous question. 
The text of the material previously 
referred to by Mr. RESCHENTHALER is as 
follows: 
AMENDMENT TO HOUSE RESOLUTION 1289 
At the end of the resolution, add the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 8. Immediately upon adoption of this 
resolution, the House shall proceed to the 
consideration in the House of the resolution 
(H. Res. 1290) expressing the sense of the 
House of Representatives that two consecu-
tive quarters of negative growth in gross do-
mestic product, as reported by the Bureau of

tion of, and prior to, any amount being treated 
as a payment which is made by the taxpayer 
under paragraph (1) or any payment being

priate for purposes of preventing duplication, 
fraud, improper payments, or excessive pay-
ments under this section. 
‘‘(F) EXCESSIVE PAYMENT.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of any amount 
treated as a payment which is made by the tax-

plus 
‘‘(II) an amount equal to 20 percent of such

payment’ means, with respect to property for 
which an election is made under this subsection

application of this subsection, would be other-
wise allowable (determined without regard to 
section 38(c)) under subsection (a) with respect 
to such property for such taxable year. 
‘‘(3) DENIAL OF DOUBLE BENEFIT.—In the case 
of a taxpayer making an election under this 
subsection with respect to the credit determined

duced to zero and shall, for any other purposes 
under this title, be deemed to have been allowed 
to the taxpayer for such taxable year. 
‘‘(4) MIRROR CODE POSSESSIONS.—In the case 
of any possession of the United States with a 
mirror code tax system (as defined in section 
24(k)), this subsection shall not be treated as 
part of the income tax laws of the United States 
for purposes of determining the income tax law 
of such possession unless such possession elects 
to have this subsection be so treated. 
‘‘(5) BASIS REDUCTION AND RECAPTURE.—Rules 
similar to the rules of subsections (a) and (c) of

share of the tax exempt income described in 
paragraph (2)(A)(i)(III), and 
‘‘(B) guidance to ensure that the amount of 
the payment or deemed payment made under 
this subsection is commensurate with the 
amount of the credit that would be otherwise al-
lowable (determined without regard to section 
38(c)).

lowed under this section shall not apply to 
property the construction of which begins after 
December 31, 2026.’’.

taxable year in which such transaction occurs 
shall be increased by 100 percent of the aggre-
gate decrease in the credits allowed under sec-
tion 38 for all prior taxable years which would 
have resulted solely from reducing to zero any

tributable to the advanced manufacturing in-
vestment credit under section 48D(a) with re-
spect to such property.

TITLE III—NATIONAL SCIENCE 
FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE 
Subtitle A—Preliminary Matters 
SEC. 10301. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) the National Science Foundation, the De-
partment of Energy and its National Labora-
tories, and other key Federal agencies have car-
ried out vital work supporting basic and applied 
research to create knowledge that is a key driver 
of the economy of the United States and a crit-
ical component of national security; 
(2) openness to diverse perspectives and a 
focus on freedom from censorship and political 
bias will continue to make educational and re-
search institutions in the United States beacons 
to thousands of students from across the world; 
(3) increasing research and technology trans-
fer investments, building regional capacity and 
reducing geographic disparity, strengthening 
supply chains, and increasing capabilities in 
key technology focus areas will enhance the 
competitive advantage and leadership of the 
United States in the global economy; 
(4) the Federal Government must utilize the 
full talent and potential of the entire Nation by 
avoiding undue geographic concentration of re-
search and STEM education funding, encour-
aging broader participation of populations 
underrepresented in STEM, and collaborating 
with nongovernment partners to ensure the 
leadership of the United States in technological 
innovation; and 
(5) authorization and funding for investments 
in research, education, technology transfer, in-
tellectual property, manufacturing, and other 
core strengths of the United States innovation 
ecosystem, including at the National Science 
Foundation and the Department of Energy, 
should be done on a bipartisan basis.

SEC. 10365. RECOGNITION OF THE ARECIBO OB-
SERVATORY. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Department of Defense began devel-
oping the Arecibo Observatory located in Barrio 
Esperanza, Arecibo, Puerto Rico, during the 
1950s, and its characteristic instrument, a large 
radio telescope of 305 meters in diameter was 
completed in 1963. 
(2) The facility was later owned by the Na-
tional Science Foundation, and supported by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration and various university partners. 
(3) The Arecibo Observatory’s 305-meter fixed 
spherical radio telescope, was the world’s larg-
est single-dish radio telescope until the Five- 
Hundred-Meter Aperture Spherical Radio Tele-
scope located in Gizhou, China, began observing 
in 2016. 
(4) The 305-meter radio telescope made unpar-
alleled contributions to the fields of radio as-
tronomy, planetary, and atmospheric sciences, 
and played a role in inspiring thousands of stu-
dents in Puerto Rico, the Nation, and the world 
to pursue careers in STEM fields through the 
Arecibo Observatory Education and Public Out-
reach Programs. 
(5) The radio telescope significantly advanced 
the field of radio astronomy, including the first 
indirect detection of gravitational waves, the 
first detection of extrasolar planets, innumer-
able contributions to the field of time domain as-
tronomy and the study of the interstellar me-
dium, and played a key role in the search for 
extraterrestrial intelligence. 
(6) The Arecibo Observatory had the best 
planetary radar system in the world, used by 
the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration for near-Earth object detection and was 
an essential part of the agency’s planetary de-
fense program. 
(7) The planetary radar at the Arecibo Ob-
servatory has contributed fundamentally and 
significantly to the knowledge of the solar sys-
tem. 
(8) The Arecibo Observatory’s Incoherent 
Scatter Radar and supporting facilities have 
provided fundamental understanding of the 
ionosphere and upper atmosphere, and the 
interface between the atmosphere and space 
that protects the planet from solar wind, mete-
ors, and other potential threats. 
(9) December 1, 2021, marks the 1-year anni-
versary of the uncontrolled collapse sustained 
by the radio telescope after a series of cable fail-
ures in tower 4. 
(b) SENSE
OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of

Subtitle D—Combating Sexual Harassment in 
Science 
SEC. 10531. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) According to the report issued by the Na-
tional Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and 
Medicine in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual Harassment of 
Women: Climate, Culture, and Consequences in 
Academic Sciences, Engineering, and Medi-
cine’’— 
(A) sexual harassment is pervasive in institu-
tions of higher education; 
(B) the most common type of sexual harass-
ment is gender harassment; 
(C) 58 percent of individuals in the academic 
workplace experience sexual harassment, the 
second highest rate when compared to the mili-
tary, the private sector, and Federal, State, and 
local government; 
(D) women who are members of racial or eth-
nic minority groups are more likely to experi-
ence sexual harassment and to feel unsafe at 
work than White women, White men, or men 
who are members of such groups; 
(E) the training for each individual who has 
a Doctor of Philosophy in the science, tech-
nology, engineering, and mathematics fields is 
estimated to cost approximately $500,000; and 
(F) attrition of an individual so trained re-
sults in a loss of talent and money. 
(2) According to a 2017 University of Illinois 
study, among astronomers and planetary sci-
entists, 18 percent of women who are members of 
racial or ethnic minority groups and 12 percent 
of White women skipped professional events be-
cause they did not feel safe attending. 
(3) Reporting procedures with respect to sex-
ual harassment are inconsistent among Federal 
research agencies and have varying degrees of 
accessibility. 
(4) There is not adequate communication 
among Federal research agencies and between 
such agencies and recipients regarding reports 
of sexual harassment, which has resulted in 
harassers receiving Federal funding after mov-
ing to a different institution. 
SEC. 10532. PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this subtitle is to increase un-
derstanding of the causes and consequences of 
sex-based and sexual harassment, as discussed 
in the report issued by the National Academies 
in 2018 entitled ‘‘Sexual Harassment of Women: 
Climate, Culture, and Consequences in Aca-
demic Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’’, 
and to advance evidence-based approaches to 
reduce the prevalence and negative impact of 
such harassment. 
SEC. 10533. DEFINITION. 
In this subtitle, the term ‘‘Director’’ means the 
Director of the National Science Foundation. 
SEC. 10534. RESEARCH AWARDS.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I have a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Ms. JOHNSON
of Texas moves that the 
House concur in the Senate amendment to 
the House amendment to the Senate amend-
ment to H.R. 4346. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1289, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology or their respective des-
ignees. 
The gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JOHNSON) and the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. LUCAS) each will con-
trol 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Texas. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and to include extraneous mate-
rial on H.R. 4346, the bill now under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I stand before you today to strongly 
urge 
support 
for 
the 
CHIPS 
and 
Science Act. 
The CHIPS Act and the bipartisan 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee provisions that form this pack-
age are vital to ensuring a bold and 
prosperous future for American science 
and innovation, maintaining our inter-
national 
competitiveness, 
and 
bol-
stering our economic and national se-
curity. 
These provisions were built with rig-
orous input from the scientific commu-
nity, industry, academia, and other 
stakeholders on what they need most 
to succeed in the 21st century. 
This final product is the result of 
months of bipartisan negotiations. It is 
also the result of dedicated efforts and 
long hours put in by the committee 
staff, and I thank each of them for 
helping us to get where we are today. 
b 1300 
With this legislation, we will bring 
about solutions for the climate crisis, 
enhance our semiconductor research 
and manufacturing, create jobs, in-
crease regional innovation, and so 
much more. We will also take historic 
and much-needed action to build a 
strong and diverse STEM workforce 
and ensure that we are able to make 
use of all the brainpower and talent we 
have in our great Nation. 
With bipartisan STEM pieces in this 
bill, we will create a bright future for 
all those who want to pursue STEM, no 
matter their race, gender, or ZIP Code. 
We are ushering in a strong future for 
our premier scientific agencies with 
transformational 
funding 
at 
NIST, 
NSF, and DOE. We also authorize im-
portant activities at NASA and address 
other discrete research topics across 
the government’s scientific agencies. 
The United States has long been a 
beacon of excellence in science and in-
novation, and it is far past time that 
we revitalize Federal support for the

initiatives that have enabled us to 
lead. 
I am proud of this package, and I am 
especially proud of the bipartisan pro-
visions in Division B that began in the 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee. 
I 
thank 
Ranking 
Member 
LUCAS for his partnership in this effort. 
I know that this package does not 
have everything that everyone wanted. 
It doesn’t have everything I wanted, 
but that is the nature of compromise 
and a result of urgency of this situa-
tion. 
We must pass this legislation imme-
diately to ensure that the United 
States remains a global leader in 
science, technology, and innovation 
and to bolster our economic and na-
tional security. 
I urge all Members to put aside poli-
tics and support this thoughtful and 
balanced bipartisan package. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, just 24 hours ago, I ex-
pected my remarks on the CHIPS and 
Science Act to be very different. 
I have worked on this bill for more 
than 3 years. When I first took leader-
ship of the House Science, Space, and 
Technology 
Committee 
as 
ranking 
member in 2019, developing legislation 
to strengthen American science and 
technology was my highest priority. 
After extensive work, in January of 
2020, I introduced a comprehensive bill 
that created a long-term strategy for 
investment in basic research and infra-
structure to protect the economic and 
national security of the United States. 
Our committee’s chairwoman, EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON, shared my desire to 
refocus, revitalize, and reinvest in 
American science, and so we worked 
together for 2 years, gathering exten-
sive stakeholder feedback and tech-
nical advice, while holding multiple 
hearings with expert witnesses to chart 
a path forward. 
This has been an exemplary bipar-
tisan process. Chairwoman JOHNSON 
and her staff have put in countless 
hours of work with my staff to find 
strong, consensus policies to support 
Federal R&D. I thank the chairwoman 
for her partnership and leadership and 
her staff for their diligence. 
I also thank my committee staff 
members, who have put in long hours 
and hard work to craft what I believe 
could be a transformational science 
policy. I particularly thank Jennifer 
Wickre, who led this process for us 
from the very beginning. 
The Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee’s efforts over the past few 
years and the bipartisan legislation we 
produced is truly an incredible example 
of what we can achieve when we work 
together as responsible legislators in 
regular order. Unfortunately, not ev-
eryone shares our commitment to that 
process. 
Mr. Speaker, I was frustrated last 
year when Democratic leadership put 
off conferencing our competitiveness 
legislation with our colleagues across 
the Hill in favor of focusing on the 
doomed Build Back Better Act. 
I was frustrated when the proposed 
funding for semiconductor manufac-
turing jumped from $24 billion to $52 
billion with no explanation. 
I was frustrated when, after finally 
starting on conference negotiations, 
the other body tied our research policy 
to reconciliation. 
I was frustrated when negotiations 
were shut down, and I was even more 
frustrated when the House was shut 
out of discussions once they picked 
back up. 
So maybe I shouldn’t be surprised, 
but I am frankly, in all fairness, dis-
gusted by the developments over the 
last 24 hours. 
House Republicans have been work-
ing in good faith this entire time to 
come to consensus legislation that 
could be passed by both Chambers. But 
time and time again, we have been 
thwarted by Democratic leadership 
that has moved the goalposts, shut 
down the process, chosen their divisive 
partisan policies over a smart bipar-
tisan bill that would benefit our coun-
try for generations. 
I understand why people on my side 
of the room are furious. I share those 
concerns, and I have been around here 
long enough to know that this is not 
the way to do things. For better or for 
worse—and it is very clearly for the 
worse, I would note—the CHIPS and 
Science Act has been irrevocably tied 
to a massive tax hike and spending 
spree in reconciliation. 
The decisions on how to pursue sci-
entific policy are out of the hands of 
this committee, and at this point prac-
tically out of the hands of this Cham-
ber. 
Mr. Speaker, I remain incredibly 
proud of the good work we have done to 
strategically strengthen American re-
search and development. And yet I can-
not ignore the fact that the immense 
tax hikes and irresponsible spending in 
the expanded reconciliation package 
change the calculus when it comes to 
supporting spending bills, particularly 
a bill that has come to be tied to rec-
onciliation. 
This is one of those occasions that, 
as a statesman and responsible Member 
of Congress, I have to put aside my own 
pride in the Science, Space, and Tech-
nology Committee’s work and cast a 
vote that represents the best interests 
of Americans, and particularly the 
good people of the Third District of 
Oklahoma. 
So, regrettably—and it is more re-
grettably than you can possibly imag-
ine—I will not be casting my vote for 
the CHIPS and Science Act today. 
I emphasize that this is in no way a 
reflection of my feeling about the 
transformational research policies in 
this bill. I am grateful to Chairwoman 
JOHNSON for working with me every 
step of the way to create a strategic, 
bipartisan, forward-thinking policy. 
I just wish other legislators in both 
Chambers would follow our example in-
stead of forcing indefensible votes like 
we have today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), our dis-
tinguished Speaker. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in praise of this legislation as 
the House prepares to pass the CHIPS 
and Science Act, a bipartisan, bi-
cameral bill that will well-equip our 
Nation to meet and beat the challenges 
of the 21st century. 
With the monumental investments in 
this legislation, we take key steps to 
strengthen our families’ and our Na-
tion’s economic future, remove road-
blocks to developing scientific talent, 
and unleash research investment in 
every corner of America now and for 
generations to come. 
Let us salute the outstanding leader-
ship of the House negotiators who tire-
lessly fought for and secured many 
major victories for American families 
and the American economy in this 
package. 
Thank you, in particular, to two ter-
rific champions: Chairwoman EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON of the Science, Space, 
and Technology Committee, Chairman 
FRANK
PALLONE
of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee, as well as other 
chairs who were involved in this legis-
lation. I also acknowledge the leader-
ship of the ranking member, Mr. 
LUCAS. It was a joy and inspiring to be-
hold Mr. LUCAS’ very informative and 
impressive presentation in favor of this 
legislation at the Rules Committee 
yesterday. In fact, half a dozen of the 
bills contained in this legislation are 
Republican bills. 
I particularly join Mr. LUCAS in com-
mending the staff on this and pay spe-
cial tribute to Jenn Wickre, who has 
been remarkable in building biparti-
sanship in this legislation. My under-
standing is that she is recovering at 
home. I send her best wishes and pray-
ers for a speedy recovery, with deep 
gratitude for her bipartisanship in put-
ting this legislation together, which 
you so eloquently supported in the 
Rules Committee yesterday. 
For generations, America has offered 
a beacon of excellence in science, inno-
vation, and engineering. Our research 
has generated ground-changing discov-
eries. Our industry has powered un-
precedented prosperity. Our technology 
has altered the course of history. And 
our workforce has been the envy of the 
world. I am so happy that in this legis-
lation up to 100,000 Davis-Bacon jobs 
will be created. 
In recent years, many other nations 
have followed our blueprint, investing 
in R&D and manufacturing and edu-
cation. Their rise not only threatens 
America’s status as the world leader in 
innovation but also the economic secu-
rity of America’s families. That is why, 
with the landmark legislation that we

will pass today, we will put America 
back on the path to preeminence so 
that we can compete and win in the 
21st century. 
When I mention those 100,000 Davis- 
Bacon jobs, that means a prevailing 
wage for our workers. I salute Chair-
man BOBBY SCOTT for his work in that 
regard. 
It is called the CHIPS and Science 
Act, and I am so happy because a week 
ago I thought it was just going to be 
the CHIPS Act. But, fortunately, with 
the help of Mr. LUCAS and the negotia-
tions of our distinguished chair, EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON, we were able to get 
it to be the CHIPS and Science Act. 
The chips are for now, that is impor-
tant, ‘‘Make It In America,’’ keep us 
preeminent. The science is about our 
ongoing preeminence, and we will talk 
some more about that. 
Again, because of the persistent, pa-
triotic negotiations, the Congress can 
take great pride in this result. EDDIE 
BERNICE JOHNSON has been a respected 
leader as chair now of the Science, 
Space, and Technology Committee, re-
spected in the science and research 
community for her ongoing commit-
ment, her knowledge, her vision, her 
values about keeping America number 
one. I thank her. 
The package includes more than $50 
billion to bolster America’s manufac-
turing of semiconductors, seizing the 
pivotal opportunity to restore our sta-
tus as world leader in chips, make it in 
America, as Mr. HOYER would say. 
Doing so is an economic imperative, 
creating, again, nearly 100,000 good- 
paying union jobs and lowering costs 
for American consumers while pro-
ducing a crucial component of nearly 
every major technology we enjoy, in-
cluding the cars we drive: 1,000 in a car, 
2,000 in an electric car. 
It is also a national security neces-
sity, reducing our dangerous depend-
ence on foreign manufacturing, espe-
cially amid growing aggression from 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
Crucially, the bill contains strong 
guardrails, 
ensuring 
these 
trans-
formative investments go straight into 
the American economy, not into stock 
buybacks or dividends or into facilities 
overseas. 
Mr. Speaker, just as importantly, 
this legislation will reinvigorate Amer-
ican innovation nationwide with robust 
investments in research and tech-
nology. 
This bill takes a giant leap toward 
building a more diverse and inclusive 
STEM workforce so that our Nation’s 
brightest minds—wherever they are in 
whatever communities ethnically, geo-
graphically, generationally—are solv-
ing problems with science and driving 
American entrepreneurship. 
This bill delivers job-creating hubs in 
every corner across the country so that 
more communities can participate in 
research and development, and this bill 
empowers our Nation to push the 
boundaries of science with investments 
that power America’s preeminence in 
both basic research and next-genera-
tion technologies. 
In doing so, we ensure America’s 
dominance in the industries of the fu-
ture for decades to come. 
b 1315 
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: This 
legislation is a resounding victory for 
the American people. Indeed, the final 
package contains a number of key pro-
visions from our America COMPETES 
Act, on the Democratic side, which 
were not included in the Senate bill. 
It was House Democrats who secured 
ironclad guardrails on the chips invest-
ments so that the Federal funding ben-
efits American workers and interests, 
not our competitors overseas. 
It was House Democrats who deliv-
ered historic funding to transform our 
Nation’s research capacity, powering 
decades of discovery at the National 
Science Foundation, Department of 
Energy, 
and 
National 
Institute 
of 
Standards and Technology. 
It was House Democrats who won 
smart, strategic investments in our 
clean energy and industries of the fu-
ture, 
supporting 
renewable 
energy, 
combating the climate crisis, and de-
veloping cutting-edge technologies. 
It was House Democrats who fought 
to broaden participation in the innova-
tion economy, building a STEM work-
force that better reflects the beautiful 
diversity of our Nation while bringing 
RECOMPETE grants—thank you, Mr. 
KILMER—to 
persistently 
distressed 
communities 
across 
the 
Nation. 
I 
thank our distinguished chairwoman, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, for making so 
much of that possible. 
Throughout the process of crafting 
the CHIPS and Science Act, the Con-
gress has approached this work with a 
proud bipartisan spirit, as was wit-
nessed by Mr. LUCAS’ beautiful presen-
tation to the Committee on Rules yes-
terday. 
This legislation was assembled with 
input from negotiators from both sides 
of the aisle and both ends of the Cap-
itol. It was the product of the commit-
tees. In the Senate, the bill earned 14 
Republican Senators’ votes for final 
passage. 
Here in the House, the America COM-
PETES Act was rooted in bipartisan 
bills with broad support in the Con-
gress and the country. As I mentioned, 
six intact Republican bills are part of 
this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, this vital legislation 
will pass today. It will pass. It would 
be my hope that it will pass with the 
broad bipartisan vote that America 
needs and America deserves. 
As we send this landmark legislation 
to President Biden’s desk, we partici-
pate in a great American tradition. In 
one of his final speeches, President 
John Kennedy addressed the National 
Academy of Sciences, where he deliv-
ered a powerful case for science as our 
North Star. His words have stood the 
test of time. He said: ‘‘I believe that 
the power of science and the responsi-
bility of science have offered mankind 
a new opportunity not only for intel-
lectual growth, but for moral dis-
cipline; not only for the acquisition of 
knowledge, but for the strengthening 
of our nerve and our will.’’ 
He knew then, and we know now, 
science serves as our nerve and our will 
to boldly seize the opportunities and 
tackle the challenges of our time. 
With 
this 
legislation, 
President 
Biden and the Democratic Congress— 
and I would hope in a bipartisan way— 
proudly charge ahead in this all-Amer-
ican 
spirit 
with 
science, 
science, 
science, and science leading the way. 
People say to me, ‘‘Well, science or 
faith?’’ I say I believe that science is 
an answer to our prayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong and bi-
partisan vote for the CHIPS and 
Science Act. I thank all who are in-
volved in this, including Mr. LUCAS and 
our distinguished chair, other chairs on 
both sides of the Capitol, and Members 
on both sides of the aisle. I urge an 
‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BRADY), the ranking member of 
the Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. 
LUCAS
for 
his 
leadership 
on 
science, which is of so much impor-
tance to our country. 
It is official; we are in a recession. 
Joe Biden’s economy is a cruel econ-
omy. Americans are finding this out 
more and more each day. 
This 
morning’s 
economic 
report 
shows negative economic growth. Infla-
tion is crushing our families, our small 
businesses, and our entire economy. 
Now, Democrats have confirmed that 
CHIPS is a green light for higher taxes, 
corporate welfare, and, even worse, in-
flation in the future. They are insisting 
on hundreds of billions of tax increases 
on companies that build and make in 
America. 
They 
are 
insisting 
on 
unleashing 80,000 new IRS agents on 
American families, farmers, and small 
businesses. 
Who in their right mind raises taxes 
as you are entering a recession? Now, 
even Republican sponsors of the CHIPS 
bill in the Senate are urging a ‘‘no’’ 
vote. 
Good people can disagree on the con-
tents of the semiconductor issues here. 
My view is that the original bill misses 
the mark on national security and pro-
vides tax subsidies that aren’t war-
ranted. 
China is targeting 10 of our American 
technologies and industries, including 
robotics, 
biotech, 
artificial 
intel-
ligence, and on and on. It is a mistake 
and missed opportunity to subsidize 
one and help one while ceding nine of 
our industries and technologies to 
China. I believe our approach should be 
to lift all of our industries up so they 
can compete and win against China. 
I also believe we have the strongest 
semiconductor industry on this planet. 
No one sells more chips around the 
world than we do. We sell nearly half of

all the chips. The sales of the chips in 
America, the market in the world, we 
sell nearly half of it. Our production 
has been growing for 20 years. It is one 
of our biggest exports, and we have re-
liable supply chains because almost 
half of our chips for America are made 
here in America. 
I think there is a smarter way to 
tackle this issue. I am, like others, 
stunned by the turnaround—I think the 
deceit—among Senate Democrats on 
taxes and tying it, unfortunately, to 
this bill. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE). 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas, 
the 
chairwoman, for all of her work on this 
bill. 
I rise in support of H.R. 4346, the 
CHIPS and Science Act, that will lower 
costs for consumers, create good-pay-
ing American jobs, and end our dan-
gerous dependence on foreign manufac-
turers of critical goods. 
I would like to focus on two key ini-
tiatives from the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce. 
The American people may not know 
it, but semiconductors are integral to 
their everyday experiences. They are 
the microchips that are used in auto-
mobiles, 
consumer 
electronics, 
and 
washing machines. Over the past 30 
years, America’s share of semicon-
ductor 
production 
has 
plummeted, 
jeopardizing our national security and 
economic welfare. 
The COVID–19 pandemic laid bare the 
vulnerability 
of 
our 
semiconductor 
supply chains. As a result, automakers, 
medical supply companies, and manu-
facturers of heavy machinery faced se-
vere disruptions, which drove up prices. 
The CHIPS and Science Act appro-
priates over $52 billion to ensure more 
semiconductors are produced right here 
in the United States, ending our reli-
ance on other countries and lowering 
costs for consumers. 
But our competitiveness faces chal-
lenges elsewhere. Domestic vendors of 
communications network equipment 
have dwindled over the past several 
years, while the proliferation of net-
works using Huawei, a Chinese Com-
munist company, have grown. Just this 
week, there were reports about how 
Huawei strategically deployed their 
equipment in U.S. networks to maxi-
mize their espionage capabilities. 
This legislation also invests $1.5 bil-
lion in the Public Wireless Supply 
Chain Innovation Fund for the deploy-
ment and promotion of Open Radio Ac-
cess networks, or Open RAN networks. 
This deals with 5G technology. This in-
vestment will help bring more diver-
sity and innovation to wireless supply 
chains while also countering the spread 
of harmful network equipment, like 
Huawei, here and around the world. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is a win-win for 
our global competitiveness, economy, 
and consumers. I urge all of my col-
leagues to support it today. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS), the rank-
ing member of the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, China is the biggest threat 
facing America today. The Chinese 
Communist Party uses its centrally 
controlled economy to pick winners 
and losers through massive govern-
ment subsidies and handouts that ben-
efit the ruling party’s political allies. 
They do not adhere to free-market 
principles and the high labor and envi-
ronmental standards that we have here 
in America. This is not a model Amer-
ica should embrace. 
We succeed when we reward hard 
work, creative thinking, risk-taking, 
and innovation and ensure that a com-
pany’s success isn’t contingent on the 
approval, direction, or spending by the 
Federal Government. 
I support making chips in the United 
States, but we cannot lead a new era of 
innovation through massive govern-
ment subsidies. We cannot beat China 
by trying to outspend them. 
The CHIPS bill unlocks the Demo-
crats’ radical tax and spending spree 
and will make President Biden’s infla-
tion crisis worse. 
American 
competitiveness 
is 
suf-
fering today as a result of harmful reg-
ulatory barriers and record govern-
ment spending. This has resulted in 
unaffordable, high prices for every fam-
ily, supply chain issues, and, as we 
learned today, the U.S. is entering a re-
cession. 
Meanwhile, 
Democrats’ 
new 
rec-
onciliation package spends hundreds of 
billions of dollars and raises taxes to 
achieve their grand socialist agenda for 
more control and more inflation. 
To win the future, we need a reliable 
regulatory and permitting environ-
ment that unleashes innovation, se-
cures our supply chains, and ensures 
American companies are creating jobs 
right here at home in the United 
States of America. 
Instead of more radical spending, 
lifting these barriers must be central if 
we want to secure American leadership 
and beat China. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on 
H.R. 4346. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. MATSUI). 
Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the bipartisan 
CHIPS and Science Act. 
Just over 2 years ago, I joined Con-
gressman MCCAUL
to introduce the 
CHIPS for America Act to reassert 
American leadership in the strategi-
cally important semiconductor indus-
try. 
I will admit, when Senator CORNYN, 
Senator 
WARNER, 
Congressman 
MCCAUL, and I started this effort, a lot 
of Members would ask me: What are 
these semiconductors, and why are 
they so important? 
Well, I think it is clear this bill an-
swers that question. Semiconductors 
are fundamental building blocks of the 
21st century economy, and we simply 
cannot live without them. 
But since we started this effort, the 
global chip shortage has only grown 
more severe and the need for legisla-
tion more pressing. Thankfully, by 
passing the CHIPS bill today, we are 
sending a clear message: The United 
States is still the gold standard for in-
novation. 
I am glad we are acting today be-
cause other countries aren’t waiting. 
They are making aggressive invest-
ments to try to surpass us. 
The European Chips Act sets a goal 
of reaching 20 percent of worldwide 
semiconductor production by 2030. In 
Asia, Korea and India offer 50 percent 
design credits, and Taiwan offers a 15 
percent R&D credit. So, passing CHIPS 
gives us the tools we need to stay 
ahead of the pack. 
Bringing manufacturing and research 
back to the United States will have 
positive benefits in the short and long 
term. As new fabs funded by the CHIPS 
Act come online, they hold the poten-
tial to anchor regional technology 
clusters, creating well-paying jobs and 
spreading out America’s base of skilled 
workers. 
This, in turn, can provide a more se-
cure and resilient supply chain for the 
mission-critical components our na-
tional security apparatus needs to suc-
ceed. This makes America safer and 
more secure. 
I am also thrilled to have helped au-
thor legislation included in this pack-
age that will supercharge American 5G 
networks with more resilient supply 
chains through Open RAN investments. 
This new technology will pave the way 
for American companies to enter the 
telecom market and compete. 
As an author of both the CHIPS and 
Open RAN funding bills, I know these 
critical economic drivers will drive in-
novation and create American job op-
portunities for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the CHIPS and Science Act. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), a member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition to this 
legislation. 
When I recently visited with a manu-
facturer in my district whose products 
are highly dependent on access to 
chips, they told me that chips only 
comprise 5 percent of their supply 
chain challenges. 
Chips are one of 10 sectors where 
China is seeking to break American 
dominance. This bill does not address 
our issues with China. It certainly 
doesn’t address the other nine issues 
where China is also seeking to break 
American dominance. 
For the same cost of these chips pro-
visions, we could enact better R&D pol-
icy, ensure interest expensing, and 
bring IP back to the U.S. Broad-based 
policies would help all sectors of our 
economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7378 
July 28, 2022 
I am as disappointed by what is not 
in this bill as I am disappointed with 
what is in it. 
I am disappointed this bill doesn’t in-
clude 
reauthorizations 
of 
non-
controversial 
trade 
policies 
which 
waive tariffs on manufacturing inputs 
for our domestic manufacturers and en-
sure fair treatment of U.S. products 
when we export them to developing 
countries. 
Renewing these longstanding policies 
would help address our supply chain 
crisis, yet House Democrats refuse to 
bring reasonable reauthorizations to 
the floor. 
This bill falls short. It is the wrong 
bill at the wrong time, and I will be 
voting ‘‘no.’’ I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
b 1330 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL). 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairwoman for her good work. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
CHIPS and Science Act. We are here to 
put people over political discussions by 
lowering costs, creating jobs, and su-
percharging our domestic manufac-
turing. 
Our domestic manufacturing from 
time to time has lagged; and in this 
legislation, we will reinvigorate our 
chip production nationwide. 
Through sensible tax credits, we will 
incentivize further research and devel-
opment and bring 100,000 good-paying 
jobs to the American family. 
I don’t understand how the other side 
can be opposed to this. This is an argu-
ment about national security. That is 
what this is about when everything is 
pushed back. We have this opportunity 
here to put aside the theatrical discus-
sion and proceed with sensible, sub-
stantive legislation. 
Let’s get on voting for this CHIPS 
and Science Act. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. KATKO). 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member LUCAS for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of the CHIPS Plus Act. This 
legislation has the potential to bring 
transformational investments to my 
district in central New York and will 
take long overdue steps to shore up our 
domestic supply chain for semiconduc-
tors. 
Significantly, this measure has the 
support of pillars from the previous ad-
ministration on national security and 
economic 
matters: 
Mike 
Pompeo, 
former Secretary of State, supports it. 
Wilbur Ross, former Secretary of Com-
merce, supports it. Mark Esper, former 
Secretary of Defense, supports it. Rob-
ert Lighthizer, former U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative, supports it. And Robert 
O’Brien, former National Security Ad-
viser, supports it. 
That is impactful to me, and it 
should be impactful to all Americans. 
All of these former administration 
officials recognize the inherent danger 
of ceding ground on technological de-
velopment to the malign Chinese Com-
munist Party; and like me, I am sure 
none of these officials will support the 
partisan reconciliation package the 
Democrats are cooking up to raise 
taxes. 
We can’t control that. We are not in 
the majority. This is a separate bill, 
and we need to focus on what we are 
voting on today, not tomorrow, not 
next week, not next month. It is vital 
that we pass this, and I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting CHIPS 
Plus. 
I will note this in closing: Whatever 
we invest in today we will get back 
many times more by the private in-
vestment and all the economic growth 
it is going to spur. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
the CHIPS and Science Act, a historic 
bill that should have strong bipartisan 
support because it will lower costs for 
American families and restore Amer-
ican leadership in industries that are 
critical to our economic and national 
security. 
This bill is a strong response to coun-
tries like China that aim to threaten 
our industrial base, supply chains, in-
tellectual property, and technology se-
curity. 
This bill will help ensure that Amer-
ica cannot be threatened and will no 
longer accept the outsourcing of crit-
ical industries. 
We took an important step to address 
this in the President’s infrastructure 
act, 
which 
included 
an 
important 
measure I championed to ensure per-
sonal protective equipment is made in 
America. Never again will New York 
health workers be forced to wear trash 
bags to protect themselves from a 
deadly pandemic because China was 
blocking shipments of personal protec-
tive equipment. 
The CHIPS and Science Act ensures 
we are making it in America, creating 
100,000 good-paying jobs to manufac-
ture critical semiconductor compo-
nents right here in the U.S. employing 
Americans. 
It also turbocharges our research and 
development investment and workforce 
to ensure America is leading in next- 
generation innovations. 
I am so proud of the work of the 
Oversight and Reform Committee to 
support this legislation and proud to 
cast my vote for it today. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Okla-
homa (Mr. HERN). 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my 
good friend, a member of my delega-
tion and my colleague, Mr. LUCAS, for 
his leadership on this bill. No one has 
worked harder on this issue, and the 
fact that he is willing to stand up 
against it today is a testament to the 
importance of stopping the build back 
broke plan. 
America is in crisis. Even Obama’s 
economic advisers agree that wasteful 
government spending is what got us 
into this mess. And yet, the Democrats 
continue to push for more. 
We are staring down the barrel of an-
other useless, wasteful build back 
broke plan that will only make our 
problems worse. 
We should not pass one more bill on 
this floor until we see a bill than reins 
in government spending, lowers taxes, 
unleashes American energy, and gets 
Americans back to work. 
When the government spends more, 
the American people have less. The 
time to fight is now. I hope all of my 
colleagues will join me in opposition to 
this legislation. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), our distin-
guished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I regret 
that we find ourselves in this position 
of being divided on this bill. This, like 
every piece of legislation we pass, is 
not perfect. And very frankly, if we 
made a judgment on every piece of leg-
islation that we considered that I don’t 
like some other bill, we would be in 
real trouble. And maybe we are in real 
trouble. 
There was a manifesto put out by Xi 
and Putin when they met some months 
ago. Essentially what that manifesto 
said is the dictatorships, the authori-
tarian regimes are going to win be-
cause democracies cannot make deci-
sions, they are too divided, they are 
too slow. This is what they were think-
ing about. 
This is a good piece of legislation. It 
is not the piece of legislation that I 
would have written, but it is a good 
piece of legislation that does good 
things for America, and more impor-
tantly, good things for our competitive 
status in the world. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
pandemic 
has 
taught us many lessons. One of those 
lessons, reinforced by Vladimir Putin’s 
criminal war against Ukraine, is that 
we cannot and must not rely on the un-
reliable. Let me repeat that. America 
must not rely on the unreliable. We 
saw from the pandemic how reliable we 
were for so many things we needed to 
meet the crisis of the pandemic. 
The minority leader, who told us all 
that he was going to urge all of his col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill, 
talked about inflation. One of the rea-
sons we have inflation is because we 
have shortages. That is what drives 
prices up when demand is high and sup-
ply is low. You don’t have to be an 
economist to get that lesson. 
This bill seeks to address that issue 
because as we all know, chips are ubiq-
uitous in almost everything that we 
have that has anything to do with elec-
tronics. 
Every day, Americans see examples 
of why we must take steps to make our

supply chains more secure and more re-
liable. This deals with that. Yet my 
Republican friends urge a ‘‘no’’ vote, 
not because they think this bill is 
bad—they may—but because they don’t 
like another bill. That is what Xi and 
Putin are counting on. That is what 
the 
autocrats 
and 
authoritarians 
around the world are counting on, that 
democracies come to a halt. Because as 
democracies they debate and they dif-
fer, and they can’t make decisions even 
when a significant number of the mi-
nority party is for this bill. One-third 
of the United States Senate Repub-
licans voted for this bill because they 
thought it was good for competition 
between us and China and between us 
and everybody else. 
That is why it is so sad for me to 
come here seeing this division on a par-
tisan basis because of another bill. And 
so America, if we don’t prevail on this 
bill, will see our competitive edge 
squandered because as the Secretary of 
Commerce says, there are a lot of coun-
tries that are going to put money on 
the table and say come to me. I am 
ready. You build your factory here. 
You build your chips here. And if 
America needs chips, if our manufac-
turers need chips, well, they can come 
to us. Not good. Good for Putin. Good 
for Xi. Not for us. 
We must not rely on hostile foreign 
competitors to supply critical compo-
nents that sustain America’s manufac-
turing base. Chips are at the heart of 
that. That is what this bill is about. 
That is why we bellied up to the bar. 
That is why we are putting a lot of 
money on the table. 
This is not the reconciliation bill. 
This is about America. It is not about 
Republicans or Democrats. This is 
about 
America, 
American 
workers, 
American competitiveness, American 
manufacturers, American technology. 
I thank the chair for the extraor-
dinary investment she has led in mak-
ing our research and development com-
pete with China in a way that we will 
win. And if we win, our workers and 
our people will win. 
Microchips. In 2022, microchips are in 
nearly every product, as I said, from 
phones to cars to children’s toys. At 
the same time, advanced semiconduc-
tors are becoming more and more inte-
gral to high-tech, advanced manufac-
turing processes, making them critical 
to our economy. 
Yes, we can wait, maybe until tomor-
row, maybe until January when the 
minority party takes over—so they 
think. Maybe we will wait until then. 
Or maybe that won’t happen, and we 
will wait 24 months and Xi and Putin 
will be saying, hey, yeah, you go to it. 
They are lobbying against this bill. 
They are lobbying, paying to defeat 
this bill. Do not be their handmaiden. 
America needs a unified Congress if 
it is going to compete. Indivisible, one 
Nation. 
One of the best ways for us to ease in-
flation and bring costs down for Amer-
ican workers and consumers is to re-
move these supply pressures by making 
more of these critical components here 
in our country instead of relying on 
importing them from abroad. That is 
what we heard over and over and over 
again from the United States Senate. 
We are making materials here at 
home, creating jobs, and streamlining 
our supply chains with this bill. This 
bipartisan legislation—17 Republicans, 
one-third of the United States Senate 
Republicans voted for this bill. 
This 
bipartisan 
legislation, 
the 
CHIPS and Science Act, which will al-
ways be for me the Make It in America 
Act, represents the most significant in-
vestment in easing inflation and pro-
moting American manufacturing and 
innovation that we have seen in a gen-
eration. This is a Make It in America 
bill. Every time I say that to an audi-
ence, no matter how red or conserv-
ative or how blue or how liberal, they 
all shake their head, yes, we need to 
make it in America. That is what this 
bill is about. 
While it is not as broad as I and oth-
ers in the House had hoped for, the bill, 
nevertheless, achieves so many of our 
goals. Don’t look a gift horse in the 
mouth and say no. It makes good on 
promises that our majority made to 
the American people to govern respon-
sibly and build a post-pandemic econ-
omy that works better for more Ameri-
cans. But this was a bill that was fash-
ioned in a bipartisan way. 
b 1345 
Nobody said at the time, well, it will 
be for this bill if we like every one of 
the bills you are supporting—what a 
negative way to perceive legislation to 
approach how you vote. 
This legislation contains substantial 
new investment in science, research, 
and 
innovation—again, 
thank 
you, 
EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON—which will 
help us maintain our competitive edge, 
commercialize new discoveries, and 
train our workforce to succeed in the 
global economy. 
The investments we are making in 
this legislation are not only a major 
victory for American businesses and 
workers; they achieve a big part of the 
Make It In America plan, which I have 
talked about since 2010. That is, mak-
ing supply chains more resilient. 
When we make microchips and semi-
conductors in America, more of our 
workers and entrepreneurs will surely 
‘‘make it’’ in America. 
Across America, we are now observ-
ing Made in America Week. Isn’t that 
ironic? This is Made in America Week, 
yet we have a bill on the floor which 
invests in making it in America. The 
minority leader said on this floor: I am 
urging all of my Republican colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no.’’ Surely not because they 
are against making it in America but 
because they don’t like some other bill, 
and they are going to stamp their feet 
and have a tantrum about the other 
bill. 
This legislation now truly looks for-
ward in ensuring that our workers and 
businesses will continue having oppor-
tunities to make it in America long 
into the future. This is not about 
today. It is not about tomorrow. It is 
about the next year, the next 10 years, 
the next generation. That is what this 
bill is about. 
I plead with my colleagues, don’t re-
ject this bill based on a political per-
ception of it. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank Chair-
woman EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON for her 
leadership on the House’s similar legis-
lation, as well as all the Members who 
had policies that were incorporated 
into this bill. 
Today, we have a chance to deliver 
our promise to enact a major priority 
from President Biden’s economic agen-
da, and I would suggest a major eco-
nomic agenda of Republicans in the 
United States Senate, as articulated by 
the chairman of the Senate Committee 
on Commerce, Science, and Transpor-
tation. I hope some across the aisle 
will still vote for this bill as their Re-
publican colleagues in the Senate did 
and as they had signaled they would do 
for a long time. 
The politics changed, but the chal-
lenge we have has not, and the reality 
has not. Let us not lose this oppor-
tunity. It is disappointing that some in 
this 
House 
have 
decided 
to 
whip 
against this bill because of its leader-
ship’s opposition to the agreement an-
nounced yesterday in the Senate to 
move forward with the Inflation Reduc-
tion Act. Whether you like that bill or 
not, do not pay the price of this bill. 
Do not pay the price of setting our 
competition with others aside. 
One would hope that all of us would 
be both for investment in American 
competitiveness and for reducing infla-
tion and the deficit. Sadly, that seems 
not to be the case. Nevertheless, I hope 
we will have a bipartisan vote today on 
this bill. 
Let’s come together to make our sup-
ply chain stronger, protect our na-
tional security, invest in our innova-
tion-driven economy, and advantage 
American workers so they can make it 
in America. 
Mr. Speaker, I say to my colleagues: 
We talk about the loyal opposition. 
The loyal opposition need not be loyal 
to the other party. It does need to be 
loyal to the country. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my friend from Okla-
homa for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the distinguished leader 
was exactly right in his comments, but 
I would just like people to think about 
something. 
Every single problem we face today 
globally emanated right here, from this 
same floor. Tax policy, regulation pol-
icy, drove most of these businesses off-
shore. They didn’t leave because they 
didn’t like America. They left because 
it looked like America didn’t like 
them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7380 
July 28, 2022 
We have seen the erosion of so much 
of what it is that we are, all because of 
policy that emanated right from this 
same floor. Now, we are trying to do 
something to correct bad policy in the 
past. 
I am in the automobile business. We 
can’t finish building cars because we 
don’t have the product necessary to 
finish them. Most of the people we talk 
to said we didn’t leave America by 
choice. We were forced offshore by pol-
icy. The Speaker and I know this be-
cause we are big fans of the steel busi-
ness. 
The only thing I would ask my 
friends on this side and my colleagues 
on the other side, there are con-
sequences for past performance. This 
bill in no way is perfect, and Mr. HOYER 
is exactly correct about that. But the 
question is: What is it that we are try-
ing to fix, and whose problem is it? The 
answer is: It is our problem because it 
is happening in real time on our watch. 
We have to do something. Doing noth-
ing is not the answer to how we fix this 
bad situation. 
But we can’t do everything from the 
House. We have to rely on the Senate 
to participate. Then, we look at what 
we had initially started and say: What 
did they do to the piece that we were 
trying to get done? 
Listen, I know the debate can get 
heated. We can talk about how patri-
otic we are, and we can talk about 
what the future is not only for our-
selves but for our children and our 
grandchildren and our great-grand-
children. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman an additional 1 minute. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I suggest that all of us need 
to take a good long look in the mirror 
and see who it is that can change the 
future. 
There is no sense in talking about 
what happened in the past. The past is 
the past, and we cannot reclaim it. We 
can just deal with it. 
We have a huge problem on our hands 
today because we have allowed the 
technology to leave; we have allowed 
the production to leave; we have al-
lowed the product to leave; and then 
we come back and say now we have to 
do something to get it back. 
This may be the bill that does that. I 
don’t know. I know from certain 
States, this is a must-have for some of 
our colleagues. It is a must-have for us 
to remain competitive. We are in a 
global economy. 
I can tell you this: I wish this was 
the same bill that we had proposed 
back when General Motors was facing 
bankruptcy because we know this 
body—not us, we weren’t here—lent 
them the money to stay alive, and they 
paid it all back in full with interest. 
This is not that same process, and 
that is why we are so caught, trying to 
figure out what we should do to face 
this part of the business. What can we 
do here? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has again ex-
pired. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, it comes down to this: We are 
not Republicans, Democrats, Libertar-
ians, or Independents in this House. We 
are truly the American people. It is up 
to us to fix problems that are bad, even 
if we started them ourselves. 
I just hope that all of our colleagues 
sit back and take a long look at what 
is being proposed today and try to fig-
ure out, not for themselves but for the 
people they represent—and most of us 
represent three-quarters of a million 
people—what is in the best interest of 
the people you represent, what is in the 
best interest of the Nation that you 
live in, and what is in the best interest 
of the future of America. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI). 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of the CHIPS and 
Science Act, and I thank Chairwoman 
JOHNSON for her leadership in bringing 
this bill to the floor today. 
The pandemic has underscored how 
important our domestic semiconductor 
supply chain is to transportation, the 
energy sector, national security, and 
scientific advancement. With this bill, 
we will make a vital investment in do-
mestic manufacturing and in workers 
in Oregon and across the country. 
I am also grateful that this legisla-
tion includes two of my bipartisan 
bills. I am the co-chair of the House 
Oceans Caucus, and my Coastal and 
Ocean Acidification Research and Inno-
vation Act will help protect the health 
of our ocean while supporting coastal 
resiliency. Acidification of the ocean 
and estuaries destabilizes coastal com-
munities, causing long-term economic 
harm. This bill will strengthen invest-
ments in research and monitoring, pro-
vide resources to mitigate, and in-
crease our understanding of the socio-
economic consequences of inaction. 
My Building STEAM Education Act 
will expand resources and grant oppor-
tunities to integrate art and design 
into STEM education programs, which 
will better engage students, prepare an 
innovative workforce full of creative 
and critical thinkers, and enhance the 
diversity of the STEM workforce. 
Overall, Mr. Speaker, the CHIPS and 
Science Act will grow U.S. leadership, 
strengthen our scientific enterprise, 
bolster research and development, grow 
our domestic semiconductor manufac-
turing base, and on-shore critical sup-
ply chains. Importantly, it will also 
support workers and create many qual-
ity jobs in Oregon and across the coun-
try. 
I thank the tireless committee staff 
for all of their work to bring this bill 
to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of 
my colleagues to put American leader-
ship above politics and support this im-
portant bipartisan bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO) 
will control the remaining time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
additional speakers, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self 2 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I am excited to advance 
this legislation that will ensure our 
Nation’s economic growth and security 
for generations to come. It is a major 
response to and a solution for inflation. 
For over 30 years, our Nation’s share 
of global semiconductor manufacturing 
has steadily declined—declined to dan-
gerously low levels. This technology 
powers our cars, phones, and critical 
infrastructure like traffic lights and 
military communications. The global 
chip shortage is not only a national se-
curity concern, but it continues to 
drive inflation when industries cannot 
secure the chips necessary to get their 
products to market. 
This CHIPS and Science Act tackles 
two 
pressing 
issues 
of 
the 
day: 
strengthening 
U.S. 
competitiveness 
and lowering costs for consumers. 
I am proud of the role the House has 
played in the development of this legis-
lation, the tireless work in the House 
that has secured meaningful guardrails 
that would prevent companies from in-
vesting in our overseas competitors 
and funds from being used for stock 
buybacks. These are very critical im-
provements. 
I also thank Chair JOHNSON and the 
House Committee on Science, Space, 
and Technology for their work on divi-
sion B of this package to support 
much-needed boosts to United States 
research and development. This in-
cludes the bipartisan Micro Act, which 
complements CHIPS funding by accel-
erating microelectronics research at 
the Department of Energy. 
I recognize Ben Kallen of the Com-
mittee on Science, Space, and Tech-
nology staff and Darian Harbeck of my 
staff for their hard work to develop and 
enact this critical legislation. 
Now is the time to recommit to bold-
ly and strategically investing in our 
Nation’s future to promote America’s 
economic strength, the well-being of 
our communities, our national secu-
rity, and our leadership around the 
world. This transformative legislation 
will indeed ensure that America can 
out-compete any Nation for decades to 
come. 
Let’s fight inflation, let’s grow jobs, 
let’s make certain that we respond 
fully to the needs of the day. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the CHIPS 
and Science Act.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7381 
July 28, 2022 
Semiconductor 
chips 
help 
power 
nearly every sector of our economy, 
and I have witnessed firsthand how the 
global chip shortage has led to idle 
plants and layoffs and continues to 
hurt the auto industry, union workers, 
and our Nation’s competitiveness by 
the hour. 
The reality is that we need to make 
more chips, and we need to make them 
in America. We are at an inflection 
point where we can and must cement 
U.S. leadership and keep America at 
the forefront of innovation and tech-
nology. 
The CHIPS and Science Act will sup-
port long-term investment in domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing, includ-
ing $2 billion for mature-node semicon-
ductor chips that are critical for the 
automotive industry, advance research 
and development, and create good-pay-
ing American jobs. These provisions 
will assist in revitalizing our States’ 
economies that have been constrained 
by supply chain vulnerabilities, reduc-
ing production and driving up prices. 
This isn’t just a manufacturing jobs 
issue, but it is also of vital importance 
to our national security. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
b 1400 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close whenever it is appro-
priate, so I continue to reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, the 
outsourcing 
of 
American 
manufac-
turing jobs has not only resulted in job 
losses and lower wages at home, it is 
threatening America’s standing as an 
economic superpower on the global 
stage. 
The CHIPS and Science Act is the 
bold action we need to maintain our 
global standing and provide a strong 
economic future for American families, 
small businesses, and workers. 
Critically, this legislation includes 
an estimated $1.8 billion for the Na-
tional Science Foundation’s Estab-
lished Program to Stimulate Competi-
tive Research, also known as EPSCoR, 
a critical program that funds cutting- 
edge scientific research in smaller 
States like Rhode Island with histori-
cally underfunded academic commu-
nities. 
Drawing on the talent, knowledge, 
and perspectives of academic institu-
tions from every State, no matter how 
small, helps maintain our competitive 
edge in scientific advancement. 
With this and the other investments 
made in this legislation, we will boost 
our domestic manufacturing capabili-
ties and supply chains, end our dan-
gerous dependence on foreign manufac-
turers, 
advance 
U.S. 
scientific 
re-
search, lower costs for American con-
sumers, and create 100,000 new, good- 
paying jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this critical legislation. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. MRVAN). 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chair for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express 
my support and appreciation that the 
House is considering the CHIPS and 
Science Act. 
Indiana’s First Congressional Dis-
trict is home to an incredible manufac-
turing, steel, and industrial workforce. 
This legislation takes historic action 
to shorten supply chains, increase the 
production of American-made semi-
conductors, and protect our national 
security. 
I thank my Senate colleague from In-
diana, Senator TODD YOUNG, for his 
steadfast leadership on this initiative. 
Today is a good day for northwest In-
diana and the State of Indiana. This bi-
partisan legislation is an investment in 
research, technology, and STEM. It al-
lows us to be in enhanced global com-
petitiveness. It makes us less reliant 
on other countries for chips and semi-
conductors. It invests in the American 
worker and ingenuity. It allows for our 
autoworkers to complete production 
without stoppages. It allows for con-
tinuity for our steel industry and steel-
workers 
and 
productivity, 
and 
it 
strengthens our Nation’s security. 
It creates an opportunity for Indiana 
in a bipartisan congressional manner 
and the delegation to come together to 
compete for a tech hub, and it creates 
a future for the next generation of 
workers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this agreement, and I thank 
the chair, again, for my time. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. STANSBURY). 
Ms. STANSBURY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the brilliant and 
boundless minds of our scientists, our 
innovators, and our young people in 
New Mexico and across the United 
States. 
There is a lot to say about the CHIPS 
bill that is so crucial for our economy, 
our national security, and for innova-
tion in our country. But today I want 
to celebrate our innovators and talk 
about the crucial importance of pass-
ing this bill. 
This bill has particular meaning for 
me as it includes my very first piece of 
legislation that I filed upon taking of-
fice last year which is the bipartisan 
Partnerships for Energy Security and 
Innovation Act. 
I thank the chairwoman, her staff, 
and the leadership for making it pos-
sible and our State’s very own Senator 
BEN RAY LUJA´ N who has led this legis-
lation for years. 
This bill leans into our State’s eco-
nomic strengths and will take our 
STEM economy to new heights. It will 
help to create a nonprofit foundation 
associated with the Department of En-
ergy to harness the knowledge and in-
novation of our national labs, our uni-
versities, our Tribal colleges, and our 
HBCUs and Hispanic-serving institu-
tions to solve our challenges at the 
highest levels. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, the lead-
ership and say: Let’s get this bill 
across the finish line, and let’s build it 
in America. 
Mr. LUCAS. I continue to reserve the 
balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. LAMB). 
Mr. LAMB. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this bill not only for the im-
portant semiconductor provisions but 
for some of the provisions that are less 
noticed, including the text of the 
SUPER Act authored by Representa-
tive GONZALEZ of Ohio and me which 
focuses on how to get the carbon emis-
sions out of steelmaking. 
It 
is 
often 
the 
people 
from 
steelmaking parts of the country who 
stand up in support of provisions like 
this, but this is important for every 
American. Every American uses 600 
pounds of steel every single year. If 
you think about the roads you drive 
on, the bridges and buildings you enter, 
your own car, and your own house, Mr. 
Speaker, it starts to add up. 
There is nowhere in the world that 
they make this steel without emitting 
more CO2 into the atmosphere. Some-
where someone in the world is going to 
figure out how to do that. If we do it 
here in the United States—we are al-
ready emitting less than everybody 
else—but if we can get it to zero, then 
we will have a product that everyone in 
the world is looking for and is crucial 
to our future. This bill will help us do 
that. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. RYAN). 
Mr. RYAN. September 19, 1977, Black 
Monday is when all the steel mills 
closed in Youngstown, Ohio, and we 
have been waiting since then for a 
transformational investment into the 
State of Ohio. This bill is going to 
allow Intel to come to Ohio and con-
vert a $20 billion deal into a $100 billion 
deal: 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 
full-time jobs with an average wage of 
$135,000 per year. It is going to trans-
form the industrial Midwest. It is going 
to allow us to out-compete China. 
This is also a national security issue. 
Young people who have been leaving 
Ohio for generations are going to be 
able to come back. This is an unbeliev-
able bill. 
This is the first step towards an in-
dustrial policy in the United States of 
America, and it is time for us to quit 
the politics, stop trying to score polit-
ical points, stop putting party over 
country, and lay down our arms. 
My God, if we can’t agree on this, 
what in the hell are we going to agree 
on?

Rebuilding the manufacturing base? 
Good-paying jobs? 
Union construction? 
Out-competing China? 
National security? 
Come on. Let’s do this. Let’s do it to-
gether. 
But we have a small group of people 
who have hijacked the Republican 
Party, and the leadership in this House 
on the Republican side is more con-
cerned with defeating Democrats than 
doing something that is best for the 
United States of America. We just saw 
it in the Senate with the burn pits leg-
islation, and we are seeing it here with 
the CHIPS legislation: party over coun-
try. 
So July 28, 2022, is going to be Black 
Thursday—the 
day 
the 
Republican 
Party has been hijacked and aligned 
themselves with Communist China. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. HIGGINS). 
Mr. 
HIGGINS 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I will tell my colleague what 
we can agree on in the hallowed Halls 
of this Chamber. We can and should 
agree that men of principle do not in-
tend to build the future of our Republic 
upon backroom deals in the dark of 
night in the upper Chamber of our bi-
cameral Congress, which is exactly 
what happened with this bill, which is 
why it is now strongly opposed by my 
colleagues in the Republican Party. 
Everything we do here to advance the 
future of America should be based upon 
the core principles that gave birth to 
America. 
Perhaps my colleague could agree 
with me upon that. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Sadly, though, 
this is called the CHIPS and Science 
Act, it left out the calculation of math 
for my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle. 
America is applauding. For once they 
will not be stopped and stymied by a 
supply chain that says: no technology, 
no cars, stay forever without wheels 
when you have a driving business. 
This bill is expected to create 100,000 
jobs. I am excited, in particular, about 
the addition of NASA’s reauthorization 
and to specifically note that NASA’s 
Johnson Space Center will be doing the 
Orion program funded, Gateway pro-
gram funded, Extravehicular Activity 
in Human Surface Mobility funded. 
Orion, Gateway and EHP funded. These 
are individual programs that we funded 
for one of the most prominent centers 
there. 
In addition, we are going to move to 
manufacturing chips in this Nation, in-
cluding Houston. 
The Democratic Republic of the 
Congo has precious metals. Where do 
they want to send them? 
To the United States of America. 
They want us to produce. They want 
us to be able to transport. 
Out of this bill with the amazing 
amount of research coming forward in 
science it is going to be a testimony. 
I want to pay tribute to Congress-
woman EDDIE
BERNICE
JOHNSON, the 
chairwoman who guided this with the 
kind of calm and expertise that has 
brought us to this point. 
Texas is proud, the Nation is proud, 
and 100,000 jobs and over $3 billion that 
will be provided in energy alone, $10.9 
billion for the Office of Science, $7.5 
billion for FY22, a 6 percent annual in-
crease. 
This is a jobs bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 
4346, the CHIPS and Science Act, which 
comes as a result of bipartisan bicameral work 
following the passage of the Competes Act 
and the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2021. 
CHIPS’ authorization was part of the William 
M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. Which author-
ized the Department of Commerce (DOC), De-
partment of Defense (DoD), and Department 
of State (DOS) to engage in activities to de-
velop onshore domestic manufacturing of 
semiconductors critical to U.S. competitive-
ness and national security. 
This bill is expected to create nearly 
100,000 new American jobs. 
And provisions in the Bill are reflecting my 
legislation. 
I am proud to say that many of those jobs 
would be housed in Texas. 
Currently, more than 30,000 Texans work in 
the manufacturing of semiconductor chips. In 
fact, for the last 11 years, my state has been 
the country’s number one top exporter of this 
product. 
There are opportunities in addressing the 
necessity of finding and refining of rare earth- 
critical mineral elements that are needed to 
manufacture technology in every aspect of the 
economy. 
I will be hosting a major energy discussion 
and a series of meetings in September and 
October to focus on closing the gap between 
U.S. demand for these materials and the sup-
ply available to us in the global marketplace. 
I believe that our nation’s independence and 
competitiveness is on the line if we do not 
solve this problem. 
On September 12, 1962, President Kennedy 
gave a speech at Rice University that outlined 
the task he was given to the nation’s best and 
brightest scientists by saying: 
‘‘We choose to go to the moon in this dec-
ade and do the other things not because they 
are easy, but because they are hard. Because 
that goal will serve to organize and measure 
the best of our energies and skills because 
that challenge is one that we’re willing to ac-
cept. One we are unwilling to postpone.’’ 
Our nation has never measured itself by the 
progress of other nations, but by the bound-
lessness of our imagination that we work to 
make real. 
Before the race to the moon, the United 
States had conquered other science, engi-
neering, and technological challenges like the 
building of the Panama Canal and human 
flight. 
We know the fruit of this labor is greater 
knowledge, innovations, the unlocking of new 
knowledge, and the dispelling or confirmation 
of scientific proofs. 
As a member of the Bipartisan Space and 
Aeronautics Caucus, I am in support of the 
NASA Authorization that is included in this bill. 
I am a sponsor H.R. 5260, the Advancing 
Human Spaceflight Act of 2021, a bill estab-
lishing programs and policies pertaining to 
human presence in space. 
This bill would establish a program to de-
velop next-generation space suits and associ-
ated technologies, establish an outpost in orbit 
around the Moon as described in this bill, and 
submit a plan for achieving a power supply on 
the Moon. 
The bill declares that it is U.S. policy to con-
tinuously maintain the capability for a contin-
uous human presence in low-Earth orbit 
through and beyond the useful life of the Inter-
national Space Station (ISS) and that such ca-
pability shall maintain U.S. global leadership 
and relations with partners and allies, con-
tribute to the general welfare of the United 
States, and leverage commercial capabilities 
to promote affordability so as not to preclude 
a robust portfolio of other human space explo-
ration activities. 
I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 869, the Re-
search Investment to Spark the Economy Act 
of 2021 or the RISE Act of 2021, a bill that au-
thorizes the Departments of Agriculture, Com-
merce, Defense, Education, Energy, the Inte-
rior, Health and Human Services, and Trans-
portation, National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration (NASA), National Science Foun-
dation, and Environmental Protection Agency 
to provide support for research regarding 
COVID–19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) or 
research disrupted by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
The bill provides supplemental funding to 
extend the duration of a grant to a research 
institution, national laboratory, or individual 
that was awarded prior to the enactment of 
this bill, or to expand the purposes of such a 
grant as specified; issue awards to research 
the effects of the current pandemic and poten-
tial future pandemics; and provide flexibility on 
awards to account for facility closures or other 
limitations during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency. 
H.R. 4346, the CHIPS and Science Act bill 
before us today, includes National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration authorization for 
the: 
Artemis Moon Program; 
Moon-to-Mars Exploration Campaign, includ-
ing the Artemis program to return America to 
the Moon; 
Maintenance of the International Space Sta-
tion. 
Extension of authorization for the Inter-
national Space Station through 2030 and es-
tablishes priorities for research, as required to 
bring Americans to Mars; 
Extend NASA Enhanced Use Lease Author-
ity. Enables NASA to lease underutilized; 
Prioritization through 2032, and to use lease 
revenues to address facility maintenance while 
reducing taxpayer costs; 
goal of including Earth science observations 
and the search for life beyond Earth; 
Advancement of U.S. Aeronautics Leader-
ship 
Enhancement of NASA Technology, Infra-
structure, and Workforce; and 
Focused attention that ensures Planetary 
Defense against meteors and large asteroids. 
I have long held an intense interest in the 
Nation’s premier space exploration agency, 
first as a member of the House Science Com-
mittee and now as a member of the House 
Committee on Homeland Security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7383 
July 28, 2022 
From space exploration to climate change 
the work of Congress is needed now more 
than ever before. 
I have for several Congresses offered an 
amendment to the NDAA to provide Congress 
with a report on the issue of space debris, 
which jeopardizes human space exploration. 
These objects are a product of earlier space 
exploration when there were only a few na-
tions capable of low earth orbit space flight. 
Today, public-private partnerships and col-
laboration is bringing the commercial sector 
into space exploration. 
The space debris amendment brings valu-
able insight into the challenges, dangers, and 
opportunities present by addressing space de-
bris moving over 17,000 miles an hour and the 
real changes of debris disabling or damaging 
manmade space exploration or development 
efforts. 
President Kennedy knew what was on the 
line if our nation did not dominate the space 
race. 
Because he understood what was at stake 
he set the nation’s sights on people walking 
on the surface of the moon, and to safely re-
turn home required technology, materials, met-
als, food preservation, clothing, and instru-
ments that had not been invented at the time 
of his speech this was a monumental chal-
lenge that captivated and motivated Ameri-
cans—All Americans to find within themselves 
the talent, courage, and fortitude needed to 
make his words our nation’s greatest scientific 
accomplishment. 
He said his challenge was an act of faith 
and vision because no one know what would 
come from the effort of accomplishing the 
challenge of conquering space. 
The speech at Rice University is located in 
the city of Houston because of the concentra-
tion of engineering, researchers, and aca-
demic institutions doing cutting-edge work in 
the energy sector of the economy. 
First established as the Manned Spacecraft 
Center (MSC) in 1961, it was later named the 
Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in 
honor of the late President. 
The JSC is responsible for the design, de-
velopment, and operation of human space 
flight. 
For more than four decades, JSC has been 
the world leader in human space flight oper-
ations for NASA. 
The critical thing to understand about what 
JSC means to human space flight is to under-
stand the importance of a critical mass of ex-
perts that are working collaboratively from the 
training of astronauts to all aspects of the sup-
port during missions. 
The Center’s famed Mission Control Center, 
or MCC, has been the operational hub of 
every American human space mission for over 
40 years since Gemini IV. 
The MCC manages all activity onboard the 
space station and directs all space shuttle 
missions, including station assembly flights 
and Hubble Space Telescope servicing. Con-
struction of the control center began in late 
1962. 
In addition to conducting mission simula-
tions and operations with flight controllers, 
space was allocated for key NASA engineer-
ing and scientific personnel along with rep-
resentatives of the major contractors to sup-
port each mission. 
This increased presence strengthened the 
problem-solving capabilities of the MCC team. 
Today, JCS is comprised of a complex of 
100 buildings constructed on 1,620 acres that 
is known as Space City. 
Houston is where the Johnson Space Cen-
ter was born and remains to this day—a place 
of boundless imagination in the pursuit of new 
horizons in space exploration. 
There are approximately 3,200 civil serv-
ants, including 110 astronauts, employed at 
Johnson Space Center, and a contract work-
force of over 15,000 are the people who pre-
pare people for space missions. 
This bill is a matter of national pride, na-
tional economic innovation, and most impor-
tantly, national security. 
I want to note for Congress and the nation 
that the JSC with continuing to serve a vital 
role in the next chapter of space exploration 
for our nation. 
Several essential NASA programs are au-
thorized and fully funded separately under this 
authorization bill. 
The bill provides funding for each of the es-
sential tasks that NASA has for the JSC: 
the Orion Gateway Program is funded sepa-
rately, 
Extravehicular Activity is funded separately, 
and 
Human Surface Mobility (EHP) Program is 
funded separately. 
The authorization language in this bill 
makes clear that the Orion Gateway Program, 
Extravehicular Activity, and Human Surface 
Mobility (EHP) Program are assigned to the 
Johnson Space Center. 
Language in this bill also provides clarity 
that all new lunar and Mars samples are under 
the purview of the JSC. 
This is a wise decision given that the JSC 
maintains over 5 decades of experience and 
expertise in the stewardship and curation of all 
current collections of NASA-held Astro-mate-
rials. 
All U.S. government or U.S. government 
contracted services involving extraterrestrial 
material or Astro-materials such as, but not 
limited to rocks, dust, minerals, meteorites, 
regolith, ices, organic matter, gasses, and 
atoms, and including samples collected in 
space, on other solar system bodies, and on 
earth will be curated and managed by John-
son Space Center. 
NASA’s Johnson Space Center shall curate 
and manage all NASA-held Astro-material 
sample collections, including providing loans 
of Astro-material specimens, review of the pro-
posed use, approval of research investiga-
tions, education, and public display. 
These are NASA Johnson Space Center 
Human Exploration Programs that are a part 
of Moon to Mars or Artemis, all funded sepa-
rately in this bill. They are: 
Orion Program; 
Gateway Program—Referred to in the bill as 
‘‘an outpost in orbit around the moon’’; 
Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface 
Mobility 
(EHP) 
Program—in 
the 
bill 
‘‘Spacesuits’’ are called out and state any 
other elements needed to meet the require-
ment of the Moon to Mars Program; and 
Orion, Gateway, and EHP (suits and Mobile 
systems, rovers), all are critical Programs. 
Just as the moon project was a massive en-
deavor that would touch nearly every aspect 
of our nation’s scientific community and efforts 
so will the work outlined by this legislation. 
The CHIPS Act would invest $52 billion in 
domestic semiconductor chip manufacturing, 
and various vital science initiatives to return 
the United States to its role as the preeminent 
leader in science and modernization. 
These initiatives include efforts to expand 
diversity and equity in STEM fields by combat-
ting sexual harassment in science workplaces, 
investing in minority-serving institutions, and 
expanding fellowship and scholarship opportu-
nities for women in STEM. 
It would also focus on scientific initiatives for 
biological and environmental research that 
would accelerate the growth of clean energy 
commercialization and development across 
the country. 
Everything from helium conservation to nu-
clear physics, to biological threat prepared-
ness, is included in this bill. 
Additionally, the CHIPS and Science Act are 
authorizations for incredibly important innova-
tions happening at NASA. 
It would authorize the Artemis Moon Pro-
gram to work towards the goal of returning 
American astronauts to the moon, including 
sending the first woman and person of color. 
In addition to resuming goals of lunar land-
ings, the CHIPS and Science Act would 
prioritize the research necessary to continue 
the Orion program and bring Americans to 
Mars. 
Several essential NASA programs are au-
thorized and fully funded separately under this 
authorization bill. 
The Orion Program gateway program is 
funded separately; Extravehicular Activity is 
funded separately and Human Surface Mobil-
ity (EHP) Program is funded separately. The 
authorization language in this bill makes clear 
that 
the 
Orion 
Gateway 
Program, 
Extravehicular Activity, and Human Surface 
Mobility (EHP) Program are assigned to the 
Johnson Space Center. 
Language in this bill also provides clarifica-
tion that all new lunar and Mars samples are 
the responsibility of the Johnson Space Cen-
ter. 
The other priority I believe should have 
been included in this bill is a clarification that 
NASA’s Johnson Space Center with over 5 
decades of experience and expertise in the 
stewardship and curation of all current collec-
tions of NASA-held Astro-materials should 
continue in this role for the materials that will 
be brought back from the moon and Mars to 
earth for study. 
Further, it would have served the mission to 
make sure that all U.S. government or U.S. 
government contracted services involving ex-
traterrestrial material or Astro-materials such 
as but not limited to rocks, dust, minerals, me-
teorites, regolith, ices, organic matter, gasses, 
and atoms and including samples collected in 
space, on other solar systems bodies and 
earth should be curated and managed by 
Johnson Space Center. 
NASA’s Johnson Space Center should be 
charged with the management of all NASA- 
held Astro-material sample collections, includ-
ing providing loans of Astro-material speci-
mens, review of the proposed use, approval of 
research investigations, education, and public 
display. 
I will support the bill, and pledge to continue 
to work with my colleagues in the House and 
Members of the Senate to make sure that the 
JSC’s role in the next chapter of our nation’s 
space exploration includes management of 
materials returned to earth for study.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7384 
July 28, 2022 
In addition to its many improvements to 
STEM workforce growth and scientific re-
search and development, this bill has a par-
ticular focus on America’s need for a robust 
push in semiconductor chip manufacturing. 
Much of the funding in H.R. 4346 would be 
dedicated to building the capacity of the Amer-
ican semiconductor chip industry. 
This bill would set aside resources designed 
to incentivize the construction of potentially 7 
to 10 domestic semiconductor fabrication 
plants. 
These plants would be responsible for man-
ufacturing the core of all our modern elec-
tronics. 
Cars, cell phones, air conditioning units, 
microwave ovens, medical tools, and laptops 
all rely on semiconductor chips to transport, 
connect, feed, and support the American pub-
lic. 
The CHIPS Act would ensure that American 
consumers retain access to these products 
during times of international instability. 
The United States’ ability to manufacture 
semiconductor chips has been on a steady 
decline for decades. 
In 1990, the U.S. met roughly 40 percent of 
the world’s semiconductor chip capacity. 
In 2020, that fell to just 12 percent. 
East Asian countries like China, Taiwan, 
Korea, and Japan are now home to nearly 80 
percent of global chip fabrication. 
Some of America’s largest tech firms, in-
cluding Google, Apple, and Amazon, rely on a 
single Taiwanese manufacturer, TSMC, for 
nearly 90 percent of their chip production. 
I have long advanced that chip manufac-
turing should be domestic because of the crit-
ical importance to telecommunication, medical, 
transportation, national defense, industrial con-
trol systems, and financial systems. 
The COVID–19 pandemic made evident the 
limitations of domestic manufacturing capacity 
in the United States and vulnerabilities in glob-
al supply chains. 
During the pandemic, our healthcare cen-
ters, schools, and other vital industries strug-
gled to import the technological goods they 
needed to battle the virus, educate our chil-
dren, and keep our economy running. 
Thousands of American people died in hos-
pital beds while hospitals struggled to obtain 
additional ventilators, oxygen monitors and 
other necessary medical equipment—medical 
equipment that rely on semiconductor chips to 
work. 
Delays in supply chains and manufacturing 
capabilities undoubtedly wasted time and cost 
countless lives. 
This cannot happen again. 
The 21st-century world is only able to stay 
upright through a careful scaffolding of elec-
tronic and computer products. 
There are some products that we must 
maintain the ability to produce upon demand 
to meet domestic need. 
With Russia at war with Ukraine and an un-
certain future for Chinese and Taiwanese rela-
tions, it is more imperative than ever that the 
manufacturing of semiconductor chips returns 
to American soil, American businesses, and 
American control. 
With the passage of the CHIPS Act, the 
United States would rise again to its status as 
a world leader in the manufacturing of semi-
conductor chips. 
Doing so is an economic and national secu-
rity necessity. 
For years, the United States has neglected 
to invest in semiconductor manufacturing. 
Meanwhile, China has invested $150 billion to 
build its domestic capacity. 
If we do not invest in the future of American 
innovation and excellence now, we are sure to 
fall behind our East Asian competitors in the 
future—at the expense of the American peo-
ple. 
In addition to the provision of funding for 
manufacturing facilities, the CHIPS Act in-
cludes about $100 billion for the research and 
development of secure semiconductors and 
secure microelectronic supply chains. 
This would include the creation of a Sub-
committee on Microelectronics Leadership 
which would be tasked with developing a na-
tional strategy for the creation of a robust 
microelectronics industry in the United States 
and setting priorities for the maintenance of 
American leadership in advanced chip design 
and production. 
This is our opportunity to secure the eco-
nomic and national security of our nation. 
It is our opportunity to provide much-needed 
jobs and industry. 
It is our opportunity to return the United 
States of America to its position of prominence 
and example as a world leader in innovation 
and manufacturing. 
Made in America is good for business, it’s 
good for security, and it’s good for our people. 
That is why I wholeheartedly support the 
passage of the CHIPS and Science Act of 
2022. 
I include in the RECORD a list of 
NASA bills I have sponsored and co-
sponsored.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
PAPPAS). The gentlewoman is no longer 
recognized. 
The Chair reminds all Members to 
please heed the gavel. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Ohio (Mrs. BEATTY). 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman JOHNSON for yielding. 
Let me just take point of personal 
privilege as a Member of this House 
and salute the gentlewoman for her 
leadership, her experience, and the 
years that she has given to this Con-
gress. 
I don’t care what any colleague says 
on the other side of the aisle. Today, 
because of the gentlewoman’s leader-
ship and all others on this end—some 
on the other side—understand that this 
is about national security, understand 
that this is about our economy, and un-
derstand that this is about our work-
force. 
I am so proud to be from the great 
State of Ohio. It will be a game-chang-
er with tens of billions of dollars being 
invested into what may end up as the 
largest semiconductor manufacturing 
plant in the world. 
I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that 
Democrats will stand strong because 
we understand the difference from poli-
tics and posturing and making a dif-
ference in industries that we all use 
and need. 
Mr. Speaker, I am asking all of my 
delegation, 
Democrats 
and 
Repub-
licans, to stand up for what is right and 
vote for this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Ohio. 
Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, let me 
also end by saying that this bill will 
set a path that the United States will 
be a leader in the economy for the fu-
ture. 
I have listened repeatedly to Mem-
bers on the other side of the aisle talk 
about inflation, talk about investment, 
and talk about economics. Now I want 
them to vote that way. I want them to 
join us and support this bill that will 
make a difference for not only now but 
for our future and set us up ahead of 
other countries that have done damage 
to us. 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
may I ask how much time I have re-
maining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from Texas has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I have no more requests for time, and I 
am prepared to close. 
b 1415 
Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
additional speakers and I, too, am pre-
pared to close. I yield myself the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said in my opening 
remarks, I am deeply disappointed by 
the process that led us here, especially 
over the last 24 hours. Had Democratic 
leadership acted in good faith, we 
would be having a very different dis-
cussion today. 
I would prefer that our bipartisan 
strategic competitiveness policy had 
not been tied to the partisan and divi-
sive reconciliation legislation. But it 
would be dishonest to pretend that 
that hasn’t been the case. 
And after long and careful thought 
for what reconciliation will mean to 
the economy, the expanded govern-
ment, and the American people, I can-
not, in good conscience, vote for the $52

billion in mandatory spending; while 
knowing that hundreds of billions in 
taxes and partisan spending are about 
to bulldoze us. 
We know the numbers, but it is worth 
repeating them because they are more 
than numbers. As someone who studied 
economics, I am very cognizant that 
these are, in fact, a representation of 
the daily life for families across Amer-
ica. 
Inflation has skyrocketed to 9.1 per-
cent. Every dollar in your wallets, in 
your paycheck, in your retirement ac-
count, every dollar is now worth less. 
The next set of numbers is 1.6 and 0.9. 
Those are the most recent declines in 
our Gross Domestic Product, GDP. 
While my friends on the other side of 
the aisle want to debate the definition 
of recession, let’s put that nitpicking 
aside and step back for a moment and 
consider the big picture, what this 
means for Americans. 
Our economic growth is slowing. Our 
inflation is rising. Our job growth is ta-
pering off. Americans are unquestion-
ably worse off now than they were a 
year ago; and that is what I have to 
consider when casting today’s vote. 
What we need right now is policy to 
make our economy stronger and more 
competitive; not backroom deals that 
increase taxes on businesses and raise 
government spending. 
As I said at the start of this debate, 
I am incredibly proud of the work the 
House Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee has done to create thought-
ful, strategic, sustainable science and 
technology policy. I am grateful to 
Chairwoman JOHNSON, to the Repub-
lican and Democrat members of the 
Science Committee, and to all the 
staffers who worked to advance this 
legislation. 
While others may try to take credit, 
the truth is division B was primarily 
developed and written by our com-
mittee, which has been working on this 
issue for longer than anyone on the 
Hill. 
I would like very much to cast my 
vote in support of our research and de-
velopment policies, but I cannot ignore 
the consequences of doing so, alongside 
a deeply flawed reconciliation package. 
I owe it to my constituents to vote in 
their best interests. And today, that 
means voting against the legislation I 
have long supported. 
I will conclude with this: I believe 
the bipartisan leadership of the House 
Science, Space, and Technology Com-
mittee represents the best that Con-
gress can be when we work together in 
a transparent fashion to come to agree-
ments that serve the American people. 
I believe that actions taken by 
Democratic leadership yesterday are a 
sad example of the dysfunction that 
plagues Congress when we ignore these 
details. I am deeply disappointed in 
this process. 
Even with all my admiration for my 
chairwoman, and all the respect for our 
mutual members and our staffs, even 
with all that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
I would simply like to say in closing 
that when we pass up an opportunity 
that we have like today in this bill, 
where we are looking out for our sci-
entific enterprise, looking out for our 
space exploration and chip manufac-
turing, which will drive our future, we 
simply will be closing the door to our 
future to turn any of this down. 
We cannot be competitive in the 
world without adequate research and 
adequate assistance to keep our re-
search enterprise growing strongly. I 
am not willing to give up this oppor-
tunity and close the door on my Na-
tion. 
And I simply would ask all the people 
who possibly can, not to think about 
the bill that was passed or going to 
pass in the Senate yesterday, or last 
night, but think about the importance 
of keeping the doors and opportunities 
open for our Nation and having the 
jobs and talent right here in the United 
States. 
It is bigger than all of us. We were 
sent here to look out for our Nation, 
and this is a measure that will do that. 
So I simply plead with everyone who 
can possibly see the future, or even 
dream about the future, to vote for this 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 4346, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I want to commend 
the authors of the CHIPS Act of 2022 for in-
cluding $52.7 billion to incentivize investments 
and continued American leadership in semi-
conductor manufacturing to help address sup-
ply chain disruptions and ensure that more 
semiconductors are produced here at home. 
Currently, only 12 percent of chips are manu-
factured domestically, compared to 37 percent 
in the 1990s. The CHIPS Act of 2022 will en-
sure the Congressional goal of promoting do-
mestic competitiveness and the Act also in-
cludes safeguards to ensure that recipients of 
Federal funds from these programs cannot 
build advanced semiconductor production fa-
cilities in countries that present a national se-
curity concern. 
Within my central Florida district is the 
NeoCity technology campus which is recog-
nized as an emerging microelectronics manu-
facturing and advanced packaging hub, that 
has already made synergies with institutions of 
higher education across Florida and key part-
nerships with the U.S. Department of Defense 
and U.S. Department of Commerce. NeoCity 
is home to BRIDG, a not for-profit, public-pri-
vate partnership specializing in domestic semi-
conductor research, advanced packaging, and 
manufacturing. Imec, a world-renowned inter-
national research and development organiza-
tion active in semiconductor design and archi-
tecture. SUSS MicroTec and TEL, leading 
suppliers of equipment and process solutions 
for the semiconductor industry. And Sky Water 
Technology, the only U.S. owned and oper-
ated pure play trusted foundry, that works on 
leading edge advanced packaging technology. 
They all work in collaboration out of the Cen-
ter for Neovation, one of the most state-of-the- 
art advanced manufacturing facilities in the 
western hemisphere. As envisioned by this im-
portant legislation, the facilities, and experts at 
BRIDG, imec, SUSS MicroTec, TEL, and Sky 
Water Technology offer immediate capability 
to accelerate U.S. production of critical semi-
conductor chips, strengthen the domestic sup-
ply chain so chips are made in America, and 
turbocharge our research capacity. Equally as 
important, the NeoCity Academy, a public 
STEM magnet high school, is training the 
leaders of tomorrow’s science and technology 
workforce. 
I am proud of the work being undertaken in 
my district to support domestic semiconductor 
manufacturing technology development as 
they work to address the supply chain. I look 
forward to working with the Administration and 
the U.S. Department of Commerce on imple-
mentation of the CHIPS for America Fund. 
Additionally, I appreciate the inclusion of two 
provisions that I submitted that were included 
in the final passage, one amendment and one 
standalone bill. One COMPETES Act amend-
ment was included to extend non-profits to be 
included in CHIPS funding. Specifically, the 
provision adds nonprofits to the definition of 
‘‘covered entities’’ to expand the semicon-
ductor incentive program to include nonprofit 
entities, which clarifies that non-profit entities 
like the 501(c)(3) fatalities in NeoCity are also 
eligible for funding under the semiconductor 
incentive program. Finally, I appreciate the in-
clusion of a standalone bill, H.R. 8545, that 
Requires the Director of the Office of Science 
and 
Technology 
Policy 
to 
establish 
a 
blockchain and cryptocurrencies advisory spe-
cialist position within the Office to advise the 
President on matters related to blockchain and 
cryptocurrencies. OSTP advises the President 
and others within the Executive Office of the 
President on the scientific, engineering, and 
technological aspects of the economy, national 
security, homeland security, health, foreign re-
lations, and the environment. it is critical to 
create such a position within OSTP to ensure 
there is a policy expert. 
Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the CHIPS and Science Act. 
As a member of the Science, Space, and 
Technology Committee and as chair of the 
Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee, I 
couldn’t be more thrilled to pass this historic 
bill today. 
The bill makes transformational new invest-
ments in research, innovation, and American 
manufacturing, which will bolster our leader-
ship across the globe. 
I want to take a moment to highlight some 
of the specific provisions that I championed 
along the way. The CHIPS and Science Act 
includes my National Secure Data Service Act, 
which will create a pilot program at the Na-
tional Science Foundation to test different ap-
proaches on how we can link government- 
wide data. 
Right now, the lack of coordination across 
the federal government’s data infrastructure 
limits the ability to generate timely information 
that is needed to promote evidence-based pol-
icymaking. 
Another provision I am thrilled with is the in-
clusion of the DOE Science for the Future Act. 
This provision includes a massive invest-
ment into our fusion energy R&D enterprise. 
We are on the cusp of bringing fusion en-
ergy to the grid in the next decade and I am 
so excited that this bill will bolster our re-
search and efforts on it at DOE. 
Finally, I am over the moon (pun intended) 
about the inclusion of a NASA Authorization in 
the final package.

July 28, 2022 
Congress has not authorized NASA since 
2017, and this has been my number one pri-
ority since taking over the chairmanship of the 
Space and Aeronautics Subcommittee last 
year. 
The bill authorizes key programs at NASA 
including Artemis, ISS extension, sustainable 
aviation, space nuclear systems, and many 
science missions. 
It also contains my Cleaner, Quieter Air-
planes Act and NASA Enhanced Use Leasing 
Act—both huge wins for NASA and our com-
munities. 
Simply put, the CHIPS and Science Act will 
be a huge boon to our nation’s leadership in 
key areas and I am so looking forward to vot-
ing a resounding yes. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
LEBANON—MESSAGE FROM THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117–137) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Leb-
anon declared in Executive Order 13441 
of August 1, 2007, is to continue in ef-
fect beyond August 1, 2022.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7388 
July 28, 2022 
Certain ongoing activities, such as 
Iran’s continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah—which include increasingly 
sophisticated weapons systems—serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, 
contribute to political and economic 
instability in the region, and continue 
to constitute an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13441 with respect to Lebanon.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7389 
July 28, 2022 
Mr. Speaker, the question that this 
bill addresses is whether the private, 
unregistered 
ownership 
and 
exploi-
tation of big cats, meaning lions, ti-
gers, leopards, jaguars, cougars, and 
hybrids of them should continue con-
sidering significant and real animal 
welfare, public safety, and law enforce-
ment safety concerns. 
H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public Safety 
Act says no, and would end the owner-
ship of big cats as private pets and pro-
hibit exhibitors from allowing public 
contact with big cats, including cubs. 
This bill is a culmination of over a 
decade of bipartisan effort. The Big Cat 
Public Safety Act, in one form or an-
other, has been introduced by, cospon-
sored by, and generally supported by 
Republicans and Democrats alike for 
well over a decade. Since the 112th Con-
gress, Big Cats have garnered 933 bipar-
tisan cosponsors. It was initially intro-
duced by three different Republicans 
over a number of Congresses, as well as 
the current Democratic sponsor. 
We have continued to refine the bill 
in the decade since its first introduc-
tion. We passed it by suspension last 
Congress, and I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to support it 
again now. 
The Big Cat Public Safety Act is en-
dorsed not only by numerous environ-
mental, animal welfare, and other or-
ganizations, but by countless law en-
forcement agencies and associations, 
including the National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, the Fraternal Order of Police, 
State-specific 
sheriffs’ 
associations, 
and individual law enforcement offi-
cers. 
We need to look no further than the 
compelling 
testimony 
from 
Sheriff 
Matt Lutz before our Natural Re-
sources Committee to understand the 
broad concerns with the status quo. 
In 2011, specifically, more than 50 ex-
otic animals, including 38 lions, tigers, 
and cougars were released into the pub-
lic from a private residence in Zanes-
ville, Ohio, shutting down a highway 
and terrifying the neighbors. 
Sheriff Lutz led the law enforcement 
response to the crisis. He testified at 
our hearing this year that his depart-
ment didn’t have any inventory of how 
many animals there were, they barely 
even knew that they were there to 
start with, and his officers weren’t 
trained, obviously, to deal with big 
cats and other exotic animals released 
into a public setting en masse. 
Incredibly, no one was killed or seri-
ously injured in Zanesville that day, 
but as Sheriff Lutz testified: ‘‘The out-
come could have been much worse if 
any single condition had been just 
slightly different, and it could be far 
worse the next time.’’ 
Precisely because private ownership 
is unregulated and largely unknown, 
we don’t know how many big cats are 
currently kept in private ownership in 
the U.S., but estimates are as high as 
20,000. 
Privately owned big cats are often 
purchased or bred as cubs for photo 
ops, and as they grow larger, they are 
sold into the exotic pet trade or on the 
black market for wildlife parts. Adult 
big cats in private ownership typically 
live 
in 
inhumane 
conditions 
that 
threaten public safety. 
Since 1990, around 300 dangerous inci-
dents involving big cats have resulted 
in human injuries, mauling, and death. 
In many cases, the animals are shot 
and killed, as first responders are not 
equipped for these situations. 
In 2003, Congress unanimously passed 
the Captive Wildlife Safety Act, which 
amended the Lacey Act to prohibit im-
porting, 
exporting, 
buying, 
selling, 
transporting, receiving, or acquiring 
big cats across States and the U.S. bor-
der. 
Though State laws vary, there is no 
Federal policy regarding the private 
possession or use of big cats, and one is 
critically needed. 
This bill narrowly focuses on pri-
vately owned animals. It includes ex-
emptions for exhibitors with U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture, or USDA, 
Class C licenses, and current owners 
are grandfathered in as long as they 
register with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service and abide by listed regulations. 
H.R. 263 will protect first responders 
and the public, as well as the animals 
themselves. 
In addition to public safety concerns, 
the exotic cat trade fuels other crimi-
nal behavior that we in Congress 
should not be supporting. 
As just one example, the TV series 
‘‘Tiger King’’ showed us that there is a 
dark and dangerous side to keeping 
lions, tigers, and other big cats in cap-
tivity. In fact, Joe Exotic from that se-
ries is in jail for violating the Lacey 
Act and the Endangered Species Act. 
Now, some opponents of this bill 
argue that we need to make changes to 
the bill to help small zoos stay in busi-
ness. This bill would not affect small 
zoos. The reality is that most zoos, 
whether they are big or small, already 
have policies in place that reflect the 
Big Cat Public Safety Act standards. 
They are not going to be asked to do 
anything that they are not doing al-
ready. They don’t allow public contact 
or cub petting, and they already keep 
cats at a safe distance away from the 
public. There are only a small few who 
still allow it, and they shouldn’t. 
Now, we may hear claims from my 
colleague on the other side this is a 
USDA, U.S. Department of Agriculture 
issue, not a U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service issue. The fact is that the 
USDA does not regulate private owner-
ship of animals like big cats. 
The Fish and Wildlife Service has 
long been responsible for regulating big 
cats’ interstate transfer and commerce 
under the Lacey Act and has the au-
thority to regulate the possession and 
breeding of endangered species, includ-
ing big cats. 
While the USDA provides basic re-
quirements for preventing cruelty to 
exhibited animals, the Fish and Wild-
life Service is the one that must pro-
vide stringent standards to ensure that 
threatened and endangered species are 
managed to actively promote conserva-
tion, regardless of whether the animals 
are exhibited to the public. 
The Big Cat Public Safety Act mere-
ly strengthens and expands an already 
existing framework under the Lacey 
Act. It is a commonsense, and, again, 
uniquely bipartisan solution to address 
public safety and animal abuse con-
cerns. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a July 26, 2022, letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office.

Yes, 
Under Threshold. 
Current law prohibits the import, export, 
purchase, sale, transport, or acquisition of 
big cats, such as lions and tigers, across 
state lines or the national border. H.R. 263 
would generally prohibit the breeding and 
possession of those animals, although wild-
life sanctuaries, veterinarians, colleges and 
universities, zoos, exhibitions, and other en-
tities that meet certain requirements would 
be exempt. In addition, people who already 
own such animals would be permitted to 
keep them if they register with the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service (USFWS). 
For this estimate, CBO assumes that H.R. 
263 will be enacted late in fiscal year 2022. 
The bill would direct USFWS to issue regula-
tions to implement the prohibition on breed-
ing and possession. In addition, CBO expects 
that under the bill, the Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) could revise existing regula-
tions on the licensing of entities that pos-
sess, exhibit, and breed big cats. Based on 
the costs of similar tasks, we estimate that 
developing those regulations would cost $1 
million over the 2022–2023 period. 
Many states already prohibit ownership of 
the affected species and CBO expects that 
people who currently own such animals 
would register with USFWS. Thus, violations 
under the bill would probably occur infre-
quently. On that basis, CBO estimates that

H7390 
July 28, 2022 
USFWS would incur costs of less than 
$500,000 annually after 2023 to maintain the 
registry and conduct enforcement. In total, 
we estimate that implementing H.R. 263 
would cost about $3 million over the 2022– 
2027 period; such spending would be subject 
to the availability of appropriated funds. 
Under H.R. 263, violators would be subject 
to criminal and civil penalties, which are re-
corded in the budget as revenues; some of 
those penalties could be spent without fur-
ther appropriation. Thus, enacting the bill 
would increase revenues and direct spending, 
but CBO estimates that those increases 
would be insignificant over the 2022–2032 pe-
riod because we expect the number of viola-
tions would be small. 
Because H.R. 263 would either prohibit the 
possession and breeding of big cats or require 
owners, exhibitors, and breeders to take ac-
tions that would exempt them from the pro-
hibitions, the bill contains intergovern-
mental and private-sector mandates as de-
fined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
(UMRA). 
Although CBO cannot estimate the cost to 
comply with some of the bill’s mandates, we 
expect the aggregate cost of the mandates, 
which would include both lost income and 
additional expenses to comply with the bill’s 
requirements, would not exceed the annual 
threshold established in UMRA for intergov-
ernmental and private-sector mandates ($92 
million and $184 million respectively, in 2022, 
adjusted annually for inflation). 
The bill would establish different require-
ments for entities licensed by USDA to pos-
sess, exhibit, and breed big cats; for wildlife 
sanctuaries; and for all other owners to be 
eligible for an exemption from the prohibi-
tions. Approximately 340 facilities, both pub-
lic and private, are licensed by USDA to pos-
sess, exhibit, and breed big cats. 
To qualify for an exemption from the bill’s 
prohibitions, exhibitors would be required to: 
Prohibit public contact, with limited ex-
ceptions, with the big cats; and 
Maintain a 15-foot gap between the public 
and the animals or erect a permanent bar-
rier. 
Approximately 30 exhibitors, including 
public zoos, allow physical contact with big 
cats through seasonal encounters with the 
animals, and about 150 mostly privately- 
owned facilities host or participate in special 
fundraising events that allow some form of 
encounter with the animals. 
CBO expects that prohibiting contact with 
the cats (or keeping the 15-foot gap) would 
decrease the financial success of these 
events. Using information provided by con-
servation groups and industry sources, CBO 
estimates that the cost of prohibiting or lim-
iting these activities, in the form of foregone 
income, would be about $80 million each 
year. 
CBO has no data about the physical char-
acteristics of exhibition settings or the abil-
ity of licensed exhibitors who wish to con-
tinue public exposure to the big cats to meet 
the new setback and barrier requirements. 
Thus, CBO cannot estimate the cost to com-
ply with the exemption. 
H.R. 263 would prohibit wildlife sanctuaries 
from transporting and displaying their big 
cats off site. CBO has no data on the number 
of sanctuaries that transport and display big 
cats, or the income stemming from that ac-
tivity, and thus cannot estimate the cost of 
this prohibition. 
The bill would require all other entities 
that possess big cats born before enactment 
to register the animals with USFWS if they 
want to be exempted from the bill’s prohibi-
tions. CBO cannot precisely estimate the 
cost of this mandate because regulations im-
plementing the bill, including the cost to 
register the animals, have not been devel-
oped and the number of animals that would 
need to be registered is unknown. But based 
on information from animal welfare organi-
zations, CBO expects the aggregate costs to 
be small. 
Finally, to be eligible for the exemption, 
those owners also would be prohibited from 
breeding or selling their cats. Approximately 
200 cubs are traded or sold each year at value 
of roughly $8,000 per animal, according to in-
dustry sources; many of those cubs are born 
in facilities that would be unable to continue 
breeding big cats. CBO estimates the cost of 
the breeding prohibition would be less than 
$1.6 million per year. 
The CBO staff contacts for this estimate 
are Lilia Ledezma (for federal costs) and 
Fiona Forrester (for mandates). The esti-
mate was reviewed by H. Samuel Papenfuss, 
Deputy Director of Budget Analysis. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my 
colleague 
from 
Illinois, 
Mr. 
QUIGLEY, on his work on this bill, and 
I urge all Members to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 263. There are a lot of things the 
gentleman from Hawaii said that I 
think me, and a lot of other Repub-
licans would agree on about what needs 
to happen as far as the outcomes of 
regulating big cats. But the devil is in 
the details, and that is what I hope to 
show today, that the details and the 
process and the procedures that the 
policy will create with this Democrat 
bill are not what is best for this policy. 
Today’s consideration of H.R. 263, the 
Big Cat Public Safety Act, follows ac-
tion last month by the Committee on 
Natural Resources, where this bill 
passed on a party-line vote after 2 days 
of lengthy markup. 
At a time when gas prices were set-
ting record highs on a near daily basis, 
the Committee on Natural Resources 
considered big cat legislation, once 
again, failing to address the economic 
and energy crisis facing Americans. At 
that time, committee Republicans of-
fered several amendments aimed at re-
minding our majority that we should 
be focused on reducing energy and food 
prices, not on exotic pet ownership. 
Rather than address the real crisis of 
the day, Democrats shut down debate 
on our amendments and forced a vote 
on final passage of this bill. 
So here we are, once again, consid-
ering this big cats bill in what looks to 
be a very crowded legislative week, a 
week that does not focus on energy 
prices and inflation, even when gas is 
still averaging an unbearable and unac-
ceptable $4.50 per gallon. 
Versions of this bill have been around 
since the 112th Congress, begging the 
question of why, if it is such a good 
idea, has it not been enacted over the 
last decade. Two clear reasons are that 
it would create a new regulatory 
framework and strip away States’ 
rights. 
The bill before us today is aimed at 
regulating the private ownership of so- 
called big cats by creating a new and 
duplicative regulatory authority at the 
Department of the Interior. 
The legislation is a considerable ex-
pansion of Federal regulation under 
the 
Lacey 
Act. 
In 
2003, 
Congress 
amended the Lacey Act to make it ille-
gal to import, export, buy, sell, trans-
port, receive, or acquire certain live 
big cats across State lines or the U.S. 
border. Interstate trade. The bill pro-
posed by my friends across the aisle 
regulates big cats from the Federal 
level or an intrastate level, an area 
where State laws are already in place 
to handle this. 
The Lacey Act historically deals 
with interstate and international com-
merce on endangered or injurious wild-
life, and the 2003 provisions specifically 
state that nothing in the act will su-
persede State laws, but here we are 
today taking another step to supersede 
State laws. 
This bill would expand the Lacey Act 
by blatantly overriding State law and 
enforcing intrastate regulation of big 
cats. 
It would require big cats exhibited at 
USDA-licensed or USDA-registered fa-
cilities be at least 15 feet from the pub-
lic or behind a permanent barrier, irre-
spective of State laws. It would end 
new private ownership of big cats, and 
it would mandate all big cats be reg-
istered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service within 180 days or risk having 
the Federal Government confiscate 
their animal and impose criminal fines 
and penalties. 
It would require big cat owners to 
certify that they will not breed, ac-
quire, or sell any big cats, and would 
prohibit direct public contact. 
All these mandates would supersede 
State authority and duplicate existing 
Federal Government regulation. 
Not only would this bill expand the 
Fish and Wildlife Service authorities, 
but it would overlay the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s responsibilities, 
which already regulates the treatment 
of big cats in research and exhibition 
pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act of 
1966. 
The Animal and Plant Health Inspec-
tion Service, or APHIS, at the USDA 
already has inspectors and law enforce-
ment officers in place that are experts 
in animal welfare issues. But this bill 
ignores that existing regulatory frame-
work and would create a new regu-
latory system that the Congressional 
Budget Office estimates would lead to 
$80 million in foregone revenue from 
current USDA licensed facilities. 
b 1530 
The result of this bill would be that 
USDA-licensed facilities will be regu-
lated by both APHIS under USDA and 
the Fish and Wildlife Service under the 
Department of the Interior. 
My staff and I have spent consider-
able time on this issue. One of our first 
questions was: Why not just work with 
the House and Senate Agriculture 
Committees under the jurisdiction of 
the Animal Welfare Act?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7391 
July 28, 2022 
The response we received was an ad-
mission that the bill’s outside pro-
ponents would rather work through the 
Committee on Natural Resources than 
the Committee on Agriculture. This is 
a classic case of venue shopping. 
Creating two regulatory frameworks 
and dual Federal agency management 
superseding existing State regulation 
will create confusion, waste taxpayer 
dollars, and risk failing to adequately 
regulate these facilities at all. 
There is a simple fix to the issues 
that exist. For that reason, I offered an 
amendment at our markup that will 
move the authorities proposed by H.R. 
263 into the current USDA framework 
without superseding State authorities. 
That commonsense alternative was, 
unfortunately, rejected on a party-line 
vote, and unfortunately, it was not al-
lowed to be considered today during 
the debate in the full House of Rep-
resentatives. I would dare say that had 
we adopted that amendment, this bill 
would be on the suspension calendar. 
While I agree that we want to reduce 
dangerous encounters between the pub-
lic and big cats, I cannot support this 
bill because it is an overreaching, du-
plicative, and precedent-setting pro-
posal that has already served as a blue-
print for pending legislation on other 
species. 
We need to work within existing au-
thorities, not create new and duplica-
tive ones. More importantly, we need 
to focus on the crises facing Ameri-
cans, including staggering inflation 
and the high price of energy, not big 
cats. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
reject H.R. 263, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, to my col-
league’s initial comments as to energy 
and the economy, nobody denies the 
critical importance of those issues, 
and, yes, of course, we all should be 
working collectively on those par-
ticular issues. 
But by that measure, frankly, I 
would have wished that more of my 
colleagues on the other side would have 
voted for the bill immediately prior to 
this, which is a major issue and initia-
tive to solve our supply chains and to 
take care of our national defense in 
terms of our chips. Also, by the meas-
ure that he outlines, we should not 
have addressed other critical issues in 
our country—for example, gun vio-
lence, women’s rights, and civil rights. 
Of course, we should have done that. 
The fact of the matter is that this 
Congress must and can address the 
many challenges of our country, and, 
yes, those challenges include, for this 
particular hour, the danger posed to 
our public and our law enforcement 
communities by unregulated big cats. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. QUIGLEY), 
the author of this legislation. 
Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, I indeed 
rise in strong support of my bill, H.R. 
263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act. 
In the 116th Congress, we passed this 
legislation overwhelmingly with a vote 
of 272–114. So, apparently, there are a 
significant number of Republicans, at 
least a quarter of the caucus, that 
think this is a good idea. 
Sadly, the Senate didn’t take the bill 
up then, but since that vote, we have 
been able to work with our colleagues 
in the House and Senate to ensure we 
don’t forget this important legislation 
because law enforcement and our com-
munities deserve better. 
Today, I am grateful that this body 
has had an opportunity to vote on this 
bill once again, and I am grateful to 
Mr. GRIJALVA and the House Natural 
Resources Committee for their contin-
ued support and their efforts to protect 
our neighborhoods from the threat of 
wild animals being held captive in dan-
gerous conditions. 
This legislation is about public safe-
ty and the safety of our first respond-
ers. Indeed, it is inherently inhumane 
and dangerous to keep big cats in pri-
vate residences. 
In 2011, as Mr. CASE detailed, more 
than 50 animals were released from 
their enclosures into the streets of 
Zanesville, Ohio: 18 tigers, 3 cougars, 
and 17 lions. This was just one horrific 
example of how first responders in our 
communities are put in danger when 
big cats are held captive in sub-
standard living conditions by private, 
unregistered, unprepared owners. 
The Big Cat Public Safety Act has 
been endorsed by the Fraternal Order 
of Police, the National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, the Small and Rural Law En-
forcement Executives Association, and 
numerous State and local law enforce-
ment agencies because 500-pound carni-
vores pose a serious and very real 
threat. 
There have been over 740 serious safe-
ty incidents, including hundreds of 
maulings and 25 human deaths in the 
U.S. since 1990. 
Lions and tigers do not belong in 
urban apartments or in cages in subur-
ban backyards. Private citizens simply 
do not have the resources to care for 
dangerous animals that were meant to 
roam hundreds of square miles. 
This bill is supported by the Associa-
tion of Zoos and Aquariums, which rep-
resents over 235 accredited zoos and 
aquariums across the country and 
abroad, as well as the Humane Society 
of the United States, and countless 
other animal welfare organizations be-
cause big cats are wild animals that in-
herently suffer when they are kept as 
pets in these substandard living condi-
tions. 
This bill should be supported by 
every American because, right now, 
taxpayers shoulder the cost of moni-
toring and regulating private owners, 
and when big cats are rescued from 
horrific conditions or simply aban-
doned by overwhelmed owners, they 
pay for the care and feeding of these 
cats. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank all 258 cospon-
sors from both sides of the aisle who 
support this bill, especially my friend, 
Representative 
BRIAN
FITZPATRICK, 
who has been a leader on this issue for 
many years. I urge every Member to 
stand with law enforcement. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to add to what 
my colleague, Mr. CASE, said about the 
challenges this country faces. If we 
were to argue that we should only 
focus on the top one or two issues in 
our minds at that time, the hundreds 
of other issues that this country and 
our world face would be set aside. In-
deed, in this case, we would tell law en-
forcement: Yes, we know these animals 
put you at risk, but we want to work 
on these other priorities. 
We can and must be able to do many 
things and meet all the challenges this 
country faces. We have that ability, 
and we are showing it right now. We 
passed landmark infrastructure legisla-
tion, gun safety legislation, and, today, 
CHIPS. God willing, very soon we will 
be dealing with infrastructure and the 
ability to negotiate prescription drug 
prices. 
It is a complicated world, but we 
can’t say in response: Well, we are only 
going to deal with the top one or two. 
We can do better, and we must. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, we were just wanting a 
hearing on addressing the energy crisis 
that is facing our country, and we have 
yet to have that. We have continued to 
see development of energy on Federal 
lands put to a halt by this administra-
tion, and we are still waiting for when 
we are going to have that first hearing 
to address that issue. 
While it is unfortunate that 18 big 
cats and 49 animals escaped and had to 
be put down by police officers in Zanes-
ville, Ohio, that was in 2011. It is un-
clear how this bill would have pre-
vented the situation, for the owner 
committed suicide after letting all of 
his animals out of their pens. 
Actually, if this bill was based on 
putting the authority under APHIS, 
where they already have law enforce-
ment and the infrastructure and the 
structure in place to enforce the regu-
lations, it probably would have had a 
better chance of stopping this than the 
language in the current bill does. 
No one wants to have people put in 
danger through escaped big cats, but 
enacting duplicative Federal authori-
ties under the Lacey Act and a new 
agency is totally unnecessary. Any new 
authorities at the Federal level should 
rest with APHIS. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA), who serves on the Agri-
culture Committee and can talk about 
why this bill should have been under 
APHIS. 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from Arkansas, the rank-
ing member on the Committee on Nat-
ural Resources. 
Indeed, I have enjoyed time spent on 
both of the committees we are talking

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7392 
July 28, 2022 
about here, Agriculture and Natural 
Resources. But what we are talking 
about here today is something already 
covered by current law. 
It already prohibits the import, ex-
port, transport, sale, receipt, acquisi-
tion, or purchase in interstate or for-
eign commerce of big cats. It allows ex-
ceptions for entities that are federally 
licensed by USDA, under the jurisdic-
tion of the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture, such as small family-run zoos. 
The trade of big cats, and all feder-
ally licensed zoological facilities, are 
regulated under the Animal Welfare 
Act, 
as 
mentioned, 
which 
placed 
USDA’s Animal and Plant Health In-
spection Service, known as APHIS, in 
charge of hiring inspectors and law en-
forcement officers who are experts at 
animal welfare issues. 
This bill ignores existing regulatory 
framework and creates an additional 
regulatory system by adding the De-
partment of the Interior’s Fish and 
Wildlife Service into the mix. 
So, it creates a duplicative regu-
latory structure and supersedes State 
law as well. It would mandate all per-
sons or entities that currently possess 
big cats to register each animal with 
the Fish and Wildlife Service within 180 
days of enactment of this in order to 
keep their animals. 
Some supporters of this bill have ad-
mitted it would indeed create a dupli-
cative Federal process at the Fish and 
Wildlife Service because proponents 
would rather, as mentioned, work 
through the Committee on Natural Re-
sources than through the Committee 
on Agriculture, which is its current ju-
risdiction. 
Mr. Speaker, I am looking at the cal-
endar. There are somewhere around 40 
legislative days left of this session. 
Getting both committees to have to do 
this work—obviously, they pushed it 
through already—but let’s take that to 
an agency level. Now, whether APHIS 
can do the job, do we want to add Fish 
and Wildlife to that? 
I have issues in my own district in 
California, where Fish and Wildlife 
needs to do more work on analyzing 
what the effects of their mandates are 
on water in my State and my neigh-
boring State. They are entering into 
even 
more 
responsibility 
that 
is 
unneeded. 
My colleague’s amendment would 
have perfectly dovetailed into what we 
are talking about here and kept it in 
the jurisdiction where it needs to be in-
stead of creating more bureaucracy and 
more effort by already overstretched 
government agencies that don’t have 
the personnel to cover some of the re-
sponsibilities they already have. 
Let’s look at what we are looking at 
priority-wise. 
Yes, we are supposed to be able to 
walk and chew gum and do other 
things around here, but why are we cre-
ating 
double 
effort 
from 
already 
stretched agencies still sometimes sit-
ting in COVID caves, not getting the 
job done? Adding more, that is unnec-
essary. 
It would have been very simple to 
have a clean bill here and, I think, 
some bipartisan effort, but it has all 
blown up on us here with having to 
have a duplicative effort. 
I think, unfortunately, what good 
could have come from H.R. 263 is lost 
in a set of priorities that are just try-
ing to make it easier to increase the 
bureaucracy. That is pretty sad be-
cause we want to see a good outcome 
here for these animals and for the peo-
ple who enjoy them and would like to 
continue to enjoy them. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, to the com-
ments of my colleague and friend from 
California, he says that this situation 
of private possession of big cats is al-
ready covered by current law. That is 
incorrect. 
They 
are 
not 
regulated 
under Federal law. The private posses-
sion is not regulated, nor is the private 
utilization and exploitation covered by 
current law. 
He complains that this would set up 
a duplicative environment. Neither 
USDA nor the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice is regulating in this area right now. 
So, it is a question, if one accepts the 
premise of which way you go in terms 
of who is best to regulate it, it is not 
going to duplicate anything that either 
of them does, but it will complement 
more accurately what the Fish and 
Wildlife Service is responsible for, 
which is, number one, enforcement of 
the Lacey Act, which this is a natural 
extension of, in which we focus on the 
trade and endangered species and the 
impact of that trade not only on the 
public safety but on the survival of 
those species around the world. 
b 1545 
Number one, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service does, in fact, deal with endan-
gered species. In fact, it is our primary 
agency for doing so. So this is a judg-
ment that the Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice is the appropriate agency as op-
posed to the USDA which has a dif-
ferent direction that it takes. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GRI-
JALVA), who is the chair of the full 
committee. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative CASE for the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
263, the Big Cat Public Safety Act. The 
bill is a long-overdue fix to a public 
safety and animal welfare problem that 
has been with us for too long. 
I hear from my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle, my Republican 
friends, that not only is it duplicative, 
but it is unnecessary and a waste of 
time. Unfortunately, my colleagues 
have undertaken a potted plant strat-
egy in terms of how they do business in 
the House: just water us, we are just 
going to sit there, and we are not going 
to do nothing. They are using legisla-
tion like this one to sustain a blame 
game more political than substantive 
regarding decisions being made by the 
administration or the majority in this 
House. I understand that. But it is a se-
lective blame game. 
We don’t talk about the threat to our 
democracy, we don’t talk about the 
criminalization of a woman’s right to 
make health decisions, and we don’t 
talk 
about 
the 
creeping 
authoritarianism that we see in our 
country. We don’t talk about those 
things. I think that if we are going to 
have a discussion and assess blame, 
that the discussion is open on all sides. 
So there are more big cats in private 
ownership and in captivity than in the 
wild. Private ownership of tigers, lions, 
leopards, and other big cats does abso-
lutely nothing to help these endan-
gered and threatened species recover in 
the wild. 
To make matters worse, it poses a 
threat to first responders and the pub-
lic who often don’t even know they are 
in a community until an emergency 
happens. 
State laws banning or regulating big 
cats vary greatly, and enforcement 
varies greatly. There is no Federal pol-
icy regarding the private possession of 
big cats, many of which are bred for 
cub petting and photo opportunities 
and then sold into private possession 
once they are too old for photo ops. 
Contrary to what we have heard 
today, the USDA does not have juris-
diction over private ownership of big 
cats. Instead, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service is tasked with banning the 
breeding and possession of big cats 
under the Lacey Act, which is a nat-
ural extension of the work the Fish and 
Wildlife Service already does to regu-
late the breeding of ESA-listed species. 
So it is germane to our committee, it 
is where it should be, and the Fish and 
Wildlife Service is the appropriate 
agency with both the experiences and 
the linkages to do this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend, 
the chairman of the Natural Resources 
Committee, for making a point that we 
have made, and that is that there are 
bigger issues to talk about. 
Unfortunately, the issues that my 
friend mentioned are not under the ju-
risdiction of the House Natural Re-
sources Committee. But energy produc-
tion on Federal lands and Federal 
waters are big issues that are in the ju-
risdiction of our committee. So is min-
ing all the critical resources, the ele-
ments and minerals, that are going to 
be needed to electrify the economy. 
Regarding the big CHIPS bill that 
was just passed on the floor here, a lot 
of the ingredients that go into those 
chips actually come from China. One 
hundred percent of them come from 
China. So there are bigger issues that 
we need to talk about. 
Really, this bill shouldn’t be taking 
all of this time, and it wouldn’t have 
taken all of this time if the majority 
had just worked with us a little bit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7393 
July 28, 2022 
If they had done the commonsense 
thing and had put the jurisdiction of 
regulating these cats under APHIS 
where it belongs, as I said before, we 
would probably have this bill on the 
suspension calendar and we would all 
be talking about what a good piece of 
legislation it is and how it will benefit 
the country. 
But when we take a simple issue and 
create a new Federal bureaucracy and 
give authorities to an agency, that I 
don’t even think wants these authori-
ties much less needs these authorities, 
is something we have to make an issue 
of. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the great leadership of the 
ranking member from Arkansas. I ap-
preciate his yielding some time to me. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly rise in oppo-
sition to the Big Cat Public Safety Act. 
Let it be known that I also rise in op-
position to the complete lack of deco-
rum demonstrated by the majority in 
today’s vote on the CHIPS bill. This 
Chamber is supposed to be a delibera-
tive body governed by rules and norms 
agreed to by all the Members. The ma-
jority has made a mockery of those 
rules and norms today. 
The complete disregard for the mi-
nority is what they showed today, and 
that is upsetting and disturbing. It is 
certainly no way to run the House, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Turning to this legislation at hand, 
it seems as if the Democrats are 
prioritizing literally pet projects of a 
reality TV star instead of considering 
legislation that would benefit the 
American people during this time of 
economic crisis. 
Natural Resources Committee Demo-
crats have spent their time marking up 
legislation like this instead of working 
on bills that would lower the cost of 
gas for millions of Americans. 
As the ranking member has ref-
erenced several times, our constituents 
sent us here to represent them and to 
work together to solve the issues that 
they are facing and that our Nation is 
facing. Right now, they are facing 
things like the cost of gasoline and en-
ergy production, and we are doing 
nothing about that in the Natural Re-
sources Committee. 
Legislation like this does not reflect 
the interests or the concerns of the 
American people. 
We have Americans literally suf-
fering right now economically, and we 
are debating big cats? Really? 
Of all the things that are important, 
we are in here talking about big cats. 
We have an administration right now 
gaslighting the American people by 
trying to change the definition of a re-
cession which we are experiencing. 
It is time for us to work on legisla-
tion that actually helps the American 
people. 
Because of the actions of President 
Biden and the Democrats, Americans 
are suffering from the worst inflation 
in over four decades and are now facing 
the beginning of a recession. It is time 
for Congress to work on critical legis-
lation and stop wasteful and untimely 
bills like this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public 
Safety Act. Mr. Speaker, you have got 
to be kidding me. This is ridiculous. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in response to my friend 
and colleague from Georgia, I simply 
want to read a list of some of the en-
dorsers of this particular legislation. 
These are all members of law en-
forcement: The National Sheriffs’ Asso-
ciation, the Fraternal Order of Police, 
the Sheriffs’ Association of Texas, the 
Maine Sheriffs’ Association, the West 
Virginia Sheriffs’ Association, the Ar-
kansas Sheriffs’ Association, the Kan-
sas Sheriffs’ Association, the Louisiana 
Sheriffs’ 
Association, 
the 
Buckeye 
State Sheriffs’ Association of Ohio, the 
Vermont Sheriffs’ Association, and the 
Iowa State Sheriffs’ Association. 
I have gotten to four lines of a whole 
bunch of other endorsements from law 
enforcement. 
Clearly, they regard this as one of 
the areas that we should address for 
this country out of the many chal-
lenges that we face. So I do think it is 
appropriate that we devote just a little 
bit of time to what is concerning them. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CAS-
TOR). 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong 
support of H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public 
Safety Act, as a proud cosponsor of 
this legislation for many years. 
Big cats such as lions, tigers, pan-
thers, and others deserve to live in the 
wild or in a safe and secure refuge like 
Big Cat Rescue back home in Tampa. 
But too often these beautiful crea-
tures are privately owned and exploited 
for profit in the exotic pet trade where 
they are owned by unfit individuals 
and kept in awful conditions. That is 
why we must pass the Big Cat Public 
Safety Act. It would be a catastrophe if 
we did not pass it. 
Big cats are wild animals. They do 
not belong in backyards and garages 
and should not be in regular contact 
with people unsuited to take care of 
them. It is dangerous as well. We have 
seen numerous law enforcement and 
emergency calls due to the irrespon-
sible private ownership of big cats 
fueled by those who are making money 
off of their suffering. 
So I am proud to have advocated for 
this legislation with many of the cool 
cats and kittens, volunteers, and sup-
porters of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa. 
I thank Representative QUIGLEY and 
the 
Natural 
Resources 
Committee 
Chair GRIJALVA for moving to protect 
big cats from exploitation. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to do the same with a big 
‘‘yes’’ vote on the Big Cat Public Safe-
ty Act. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I find this a bit amusing 
that the proponents of this bill are 
rolling out all the law enforcement 
agencies that are supportive of the bill. 
And why wouldn’t they be? 
Why would they care which Federal 
agency deals with it? 
They just don’t want to have to deal 
with the problem themselves. So, sure, 
they support this bill because it ad-
dresses a problem that they are having 
to deal with now. But I doubt they 
have looked past the point that it is 
creating a new Federal agency that 
doesn’t affect their budgets, it is cre-
ating a new Federal agency that makes 
things duplicative, it doesn’t affect 
their operations, and I am quite cer-
tain, had we put the amendment in to 
put this under APHIS, we would still 
have all those law enforcement agen-
cies supporting this bill. So, Mr. 
Speaker, you have to take that for 
what it is worth. 
H.R. 263 is a template that is already 
being used to regulate other animals. 
This is the weaponization of the Lacey 
Act. USDA does have jurisdiction over 
privately owned cats. The USDA-li-
censed facilities are not government- 
owned. So every time the logic trail 
that you go down about why should 
this regulation be under U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife or under the Department of 
the Interior, it comes back to there is 
no logic. It is just that somebody had 
an agenda to put it under an agency 
that is not equipped right now and 
doesn’t have the personnel right now to 
enforce it. 
So it is creating a new authorization 
that, I believe, is going to have happen 
to it what happens to many well-in-
tended laws. They get weaponized to go 
after something that they originally 
weren’t set up to go after. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Idaho (Mr. FULCHER). 
Mr. FULCHER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the ranking member of the Committee 
on Natural Resources from the State of 
Arkansas. 
Mr. Speaker, here we are, yet again, 
discussing the most important issue of 
our day: cats. Not just any cats, but 
big cats. 
My constituents have been ham-
mering my office about this issue. 
Thankfully, my Democrat colleagues 
have been listening. 
Of course, I jest. 
I shouldn’t be allowing this issue to 
be taking my time, and neither should 
you, Mr. Speaker. 
My constituents are not talking 
about big cats. There are some mis-
placed priorities here. They are talking 
about skyrocketing food and energy 
prices and the never-ending deficit 
spending from this Democratic Con-
gress. That is what is going on in my 
district. 
Here is another big concern for Idaho 
and across the West: wildfire. 
Mr. Speaker, 5.6 million acres—that 
is million with an M—have burned just

this year to date. For those of you who 
don’t live in the West or are not famil-
iar with it, wildfire is what you get 
when you choke off access to your for-
ests and regulate away the ability to 
properly manage your land. That is 
what the current leadership is doing. 
Yet, here we are talking about big cats. 
Do I dare mention the southern bor-
der crisis? 
There were 207,416 apprehensions last 
month alone with who knows how 
many got-aways, how much sex traf-
ficking, or how much illegal narcotics. 
But don’t worry. Congress is working 
on big cats. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had a lot of 
things on the agenda here for the last 
few months, and there are many things 
that are burning in the minds of our 
constituents and the people whom we 
serve. 
The people whom we serve deserve 
better. The people whom we serve are 
not talking about the things that we 
are. But yet here we are working 
through things that simply do not mat-
ter in the scheme of everything else 
going on right now. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, first of all, 
to the ranking member’s comments, 
this is an informed judgment about 
which of two existing Federal agencies 
is more appropriate to manage and ad-
minister what, I believe, if I hear the 
ranking member correctly, is our com-
mon goal, our common goal of ending 
the status quo as to the private posses-
sion and exploitation of big cats. 
b 1600 
So this is a judgment that we dis-
agree on. I have articulated our rea-
sons why Fish and Wildlife is the bet-
ter one. He has his view of USDA. It is 
a policy call for us to make. But we are 
not disagreeing with the overall goal, I 
don’t believe. 
His amendment, by the way, not 
only—his 
proposed 
amendment 
not 
only proposed to put it in USDA, but 
also to essentially preempt the pre-
emption of Federal law. So, in other 
words, there is a jumble of State laws 
out there, ranging from good, solid 
State laws, to no State laws; and that 
creates a real complicated and very 
confusing puzzle for all kinds of people, 
again, including law enforcement. 
So you cannot apply a Federal stand-
ard across the country with one sen-
tence, and then, in the next sentence 
say, oh, by the way, any State can do 
anything it wants. That doesn’t make 
any sense at all. 
So either we go in with the Federal 
standard, or we don’t go there at all. 
Our judgment under this law is that we 
need to go there with a Federal stand-
ard. 
As to my colleague’s comments on 
priorities, I would, again, refer to my 
earlier comments. Those are critical 
priorities that we are all trying to ad-
dress. 
Certainly, I haven’t checked the roll 
call vote on the bill that we just 
passed, CHIPS, but I hope, if they are 
truly interested and focused on infla-
tion, on energy, on self-sufficiency in 
our country, then I would hope that I 
saw a ‘‘yes’’ vote for them on one of the 
most major pieces of legislation that 
we will be passing and the President 
will be signing shortly to end our sup-
ply chain reliance on places like China. 
My colleague also knows that we 
have coming up a major wildfire bill to 
address that challenge that we all 
agree is a critical challenge for our 
country, and I certainly hope that he 
will view that bill favorably as well, if, 
in fact, we all have that shared goal. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BENTZ). 
Mr. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, today we 
are considering the Big Cat Public 
Safety Act. I have some concerns. 
First, this is not what most Ameri-
cans are concerned about right now. 
People outside of the Beltway are wor-
ried about the cost of living. Food 
prices are way up. Gas prices are near-
ly double what they were last year. 
Crime is skyrocketing. Drought and 
wildfire are ravaging my State of Or-
egon, and the Biden administration de-
nies responsibility; and, worse, has no 
plan. 
Americans aren’t fooled. They know 
that the priority number one should be 
lowering the cost of living. 
Second, I have concerns about the 
Big Cat bill itself. This is a State issue, 
not a Federal issue. Most States al-
ready have restrictions on keeping big 
cats as pets, if not outright bans. In 
fact, 38 States have already addressed 
the issue. 
For example, my home State of Or-
egon has already banned private pos-
session of big cats. Other States can 
legislate on this issue as they see fit. It 
is not appropriate for Congress to in-
tervene, and this would certainly be an 
improper expansion of the Lacey Act. 
We should, instead, focus upon the 
most important issues facing our Na-
tion: inflation, the price of fuel, wild-
fire, and drought. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further requests for time. I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just want to point out that it has 
been argued that we have got a hodge-
podge of laws across the State, or 
across the country, and that is what 
makes America great is that we can 
have different laws that are tailored to 
different regions of the country. 
But there are two Federal laws regu-
lating exotic animals, and they are al-
ready on the books. The Captive Wild-
life Society Act governs interstate 
commerce of big cats, and the Animal 
Welfare Act governs big cat enter-
prises. 
H.R. 263 would overlay existing ex-
otic animal laws, further complicating 
Federal law and explicitly superseding 
State laws. If a new Federal law is nec-
essary—I will say it again—the Animal 
and Plant Health Inspection Service, or 
APHIS, within USDA, has the expertise 
and knowledge to carry out these re-
sponsibilities. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Again, this is a simple issue. It is an 
issue that we shouldn’t even be having 
to debate like this. It should be on sus-
pension; but it just shows you how 
there has been an unwillingness to 
work on commonsense solutions to a 
simple problem. 
It took up 2 days of committee de-
bate when we could have been talking 
about energy; when we could have been 
talking about high inflation prices; 
when we could have been talking about 
a water crisis in the West, the drought. 
Mr. Speaker, there are 600,000 acres 
of land laying fallow in California this 
summer because they don’t have water. 
That has not even come up for one de-
bate in our Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
The gentleman talked about the cri-
sis at the southern border. Forty per-
cent of the southern border is public 
lands, which falls under the jurisdic-
tion of our committee. We have not 
had a single discussion about it. 
We spent 2 days talking about big 
cats. We are spending valuable floor 
time before we split for the August 
break debating big cats. And we are de-
bating an issue that could have been 
resolved simply. 
I hope that going forward, I hope we 
can work on these issues in a way that 
is better for the country; that is not 
trying to create some new bureaucracy 
that can be used to achieve other goals. 
And I hope that my colleagues will 
vote against H.R. 263. 
If it somehow gets out of the House, 
I hope the Senate will not pass it and 
maybe, in the next Congress, we can 
come back with commonsense legisla-
tion that addresses this issue; puts the 
jurisdictions under the right authori-
ties; and we can, once and for all, move 
on from big cats, and we can start talk-
ing about real issues that matter to 
our constituents and to the hard-
working taxpayers across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
First of all, I do want to thank my 
colleague, the ranking member of the 
full committee. He is a very good rank-
ing member and a very good person to 
work with on many challenges on our 
Natural Resources Committee. 
I appreciate his comments at the out-
set of this debate which, I believe, re-
flected an agreement as to the problem 
and as to the goal. We may be sitting 
here debating some of the implementa-
tion, but in this Congress, if we can

agree on the problem and the goal, that 
is a step forward, and I appreciate at 
least that we have that common agree-
ment. 
Yes, we do have disagreements in 
terms of the exact way to approach 
this; specifically, which Federal agency 
should actually have the con on this. 
We have outlined our arguments here 
and elsewhere, and we have a disagree-
ment, and that is part of the demo-
cratic process. We believe we have the 
better view of that, given the Fish and 
Wildlife Service’s focus. 
I do want to take issue with his com-
ment that it took 2 days to debate this 
bill in the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. Actually, the debate having to 
do with this particular issue in the 
Natural Resources Committee was far 
less than 2 days. In fact, I didn’t add it 
up. It probably amounted to 2 hours of 
those 2 days. The rest of it was really 
debating other issues in the context of 
this bill. 
So this is not a particularly com-
plicated problem to grasp from the law 
enforcement, from public safety, from 
an animal welfare perspective, and it is 
not a particularly difficult problem to 
identify very concise options and to 
make a decision on those. Those things 
were vetted in the Natural Resources 
Committee and are being vetted on the 
floor here. But to say that this took 2 
days, in all due respect, is not accu-
rate. 
I do want to comment briefly on the 
comment having to do with State laws 
are already handling this. Yes, of 
course, this is always an issue that we 
have in determining whether, in the 
context of our work here, we should 
have the Federal Government apply 
standards or leave it to the States. 
In this particular case, we have the 
worst of all worlds. We have differing 
State laws in terms of the private own-
ership and exploitation of big cats; and 
we also have both Federal and State 
laws that both preempt and leave it to 
the States. 
But I would submit that the Captive 
Wildlife Safety Act, which is where we 
started on this almost 20 years ago, a 
Federal law that said that we were 
going to, as a country, state that you 
can no longer import these big cats 
from their homes; thus, decimating 
their populations where they came 
from, and encouraging a trade that has 
led them to the brink of extinction in 
most cases. We said that that is a Fed-
eral matter, and that is what we are 
trying to follow. 
This is only an extension of that par-
ticular act. So I think it is a particu-
larly worthwhile area for us to develop 
Federal standards and end a lot of 
doubt among the States and among the 
Federal Government and the States 
collectively and get on with the goal of 
protecting our people, protecting our 
animals, and protecting our law en-
forcement. 
I urge adoption of this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

ture Investment and Jobs Act to make 
certain activities eligible for grants 
from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation 
Fund, and for other purposes, 
as

from which amounts (together with all interest 
earned on the amounts) are expended by the 
State for the abatement of the causes and the 
treatment of the effects of acid mine drainage 
resulting from coal mining practices, including 
for the costs of building, operating, maintain-
ing, and rehabilitating acid mine drainage 
treatment systems.

which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7283, the Safeguarding Treat-
ment for the Restoration of Eco-
systems from Abandoned Mines Act, or 
the STREAM Act, introduced by our 
colleague, Representative CARTWRIGHT 
of Pennsylvania. 
The STREAM Act makes a technical 
correction to existing Federal law so 
that States and Tribes can use a por-
tion of the $11.3 billion that Congress 
has already appropriated for abandoned 
coal mine cleanup to restore streams 
that are polluted by acid mine drain-
age. 
Acid mine drainage is heavily pol-
luted water that flows out of aban-
doned coal mines into streams, making 
them toxic to all wildlife and often 
turning them a bright and unnatural 
orange. 
Acid mine drainage renders streams 
biologically dead. They become unus-
able, 
undrinkable, 
unfishable, 
and 
unswimmable. It also severely limits a 
region’s potential economic growth. 
b 1615 
Thankfully, we know how to clean up 
this type of mining pollution, and we 
know that doing so will bring enor-
mous benefits to impacted commu-
nities. 
Investments made by existing Fed-
eral law for cleaning up abandoned coal 
mines are expected to create over 4,000 
jobs a year over the next 15 years. That 
is 60,000 new, good-paying jobs in com-
munities left behind by the coal indus-
try. 
Cleaning up acid mine drainage also 
restores natural areas and brings back 
wildlife. Under the existing Abandoned 
Mine Land Program run by the Depart-
ment of the Interior, eligible States 
and Tribes can set aside 30 percent of 
their annual funding allocations to 
cover the long-term costs of operating 
acid mine drainage treatment facili-
ties. 
Unfortunately, newer Federal law 
passed in this Congress does not cur-
rently give States and Tribes the same 
authority for the $11.3 billion in supple-
mental funds. 
The STREAM Act corrects this situa-
tion, giving States and Tribes the same 
flexibility to treat this devastating 
issue with legislation that has been 
passed in this Congress that they have 
had under the standard program for 
years. 
I want to emphasize that this legisla-
tion does not—I repeat, does not—af-
fect funding levels for any State. It 
simply changes the way that States 
may choose to use funds, depending on 
their individual needs when it comes to 
acid mine drainage. 
The STREAM Act has strong bipar-
tisan support. This legislation passed 
out of committee with strong bipar-
tisan support and is endorsed by Gov-
ernors, environmental groups, and the 
Interstate Mining Compact Commis-
sion. 
I include in the RECORD some testi-
mony in support of the STREAM Act 
from the Interstate Mining Compact 
Commission and letters of support 
from Governor Mike DeWine of Ohio, 
Governor Jim Justice of West Virginia, 
the Maryland Department of the Envi-
ronment, the Illinois Department of 
Natural Resources, and Trout Unlim-
ited. 
OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR, 
Columbus, OH, April 25, 2022. 
HON. RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chair, Natural Resources Committee, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN, 
Ranking Member, House Natural Resources 
Committee, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington DC. 
DEAR
CHAIRMAN
GRIJALVA
AND
RANKING 
MEMBER WESTERMAN: I am writing to ask for 
your support of H.R. 7283, the Safeguarding 
Treatment for the Restoration of Eco-
systems 
from 
Abandoned 
Mines 
Act 
(STREAMS), and its companion bill, S. 3957. 
These bills clarify that states with acid mine 
drainage (AMD) set-aside programs can de-
posit a portion of the Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act (IIJA) Abandoned Mine 
Land (AML) grant funds into AMD set-aside 
accounts. The authority to do so will im-
prove our nation’s water quality. 
Ohio has a rich history of mining that 
began more than 200 years ago when the 
state was still a territory. It is, in part, 
thanks to Ohio’s miners and coal resources 
that the industrial revolution grew. During 
the 19th and 20th Centuries, more than 3.6 
billion tons of coal were extracted from 
Ohio, and, while mining has been an integral 
part of Ohio’s past economic prosperity, the 
after-effects of coal production still endure. 
Although laws and regulations on proper 
mining 
practices 
and 
reclamation 
exist 
today, that wasn’t the case for the first 100 
years of coal mining. Prior to the enactment 
of our nation’s first mining laws in 1977, 
mines 
were 
often 
left 
abandoned 
and 
unreclaimed as mining companies moved on 
to the next site. Thousands of abandoned un-
derground mines exist in Ohio and pose sig-
nificant geologic hazards, as the acids that 
discharge from mined rock leech into our 
streams and other waterways. 
Thankfully, 
funding 
mechanisms 
have 
been put in place to confront this challenge. 
The IIJA includes $11.3 billion in new fund-
ing for AML reclamation. These funds will 
significantly increase states’ ability to ad-
dress legacy safety and environmental haz-
ards of coal mining. 
An important aspect of restoring aban-
doned mine lands is remediating acid mine 
drainage (AMD), which is caused by surface 
water flowing over or through mined rock, 
making the water highly acidic. AMD is ad-
dressed by building water treatment systems 
to neutralize acidic water and remove dis-
solved metals that harm water quality in 
streams and rivers. 
However, addressing AMD is different than 
the safety hazards caused by AML, because a 
safety hazard can be effectively eliminated 
through a one-time construction project, but 
AMD requires a treatment system to be op-
erated, maintained, and rehabilitated in per-
petuity for it to remain effective. Accord-
ingly, each AMD treatment system that a 
state builds represents a long-term liability 
that must be funded. 
Ohio currently operates and maintains 33 
treatment systems with plans to establish 
more, and unfortunately, the IIJA does not 
provide the ability to set aside a portion of 
the funds made available for ongoing AMD 
remediation. Without this authority, it will 
be extremely difficult to responsibly build 
the treatment systems necessary to make 
significant improvements in water quality 
that has been harmed by abandoned coal 
mines. 
H.R. 7283 and S. 3957 would clarify that 
states with approved AMD set-aside pro-
grams can deposit up to 30% of annual IIJA 
grant funds into the AMD set-aside account. 
This legislation is imperative to Ohio, along 
with 10 other states in the Appalachian and 
the Midwest regions who are committed to 
addressing the legacy safety and environ-
mental hazards of coal mining. 
As the 2021 Chair of the Interstate Mining 
Compact Commission and former co-chair of 
the Appalachian Regional Commission, I can 
attest to the importance of this legislation 
in addressing water quality issues resulting 
from abandoned mines in Ohio. The legisla-
tion provides the flexibility and long-term fi-
nancial stability necessary to plan, design, 
build, operate and maintain critical acid 
mine drainage treatment systems. 
Again, I ask for your support of this impor-
tant legislation. Thank you for your atten-
tion to this issue. 
Very respectfully yours, 
MIKE DEWINE,

DEAR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS: I am writing 
to you today on a matter that urgently 
needs your attention. As many of you know, 
the recently adopted Bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Law transfers $11.3 billion from the fed-
eral treasury to the Abandoned Mine Lands 
(AML) trust fund. State AML programs use 
this fund to address the adverse impacts 
from the centuries of unregulated coal min-
ing that took place prior to the adoption of 
the federal Surface Mining Control and Rec-
lamation Act in 1977. This additional money 
will be monumental to West Virginia’s AML 
program, and AML programs across the 
country, as we work together to eliminate 
safety and environmental hazards caused by 
abandoned mines. 
While we applaud the passage of the his-
toric Infrastructure Law, we want to call on 
our congressional leaders to pass the re-
cently introduced legislation that will allow 
states to move a portion of the treasury 
funds into their Acid Mine Drainage (AMD) 
Set Aside funds. This authority will provide 
West Virginia and other states with even 
more resources to address the impacts from 
mining’s early years. 
A key component in addressing AML sites 
in West Virginia and the surrounding region 
has been building water treatment systems 
to remediate AMD. Treating AMD presents a 
bigger challenge than addressing safety haz-
ards, which can often be eliminated through

one-time construction projects. Once an 
AMD treatment system is built, additional 
funding is needed for operations and mainte-
nance, so it remains effective. The expenses 
of this work go on in perpetuity. 
Historically, state AML programs have 
been funded through grants from the AML 
trust fund and fees collected from coal pro-
duction. The federal AML program allows 
states to set aside 30 percent of its grant 
funding into an interest-bearing account to 
cover the long-term cost of treating AMD. 
Although the Infrastructure Law authorizes 
continuation of collection of AML fees on 
coal production and the authority to set 
aside 30 percent of grant funds, it does not 
allow states to set aside a portion of the 
treasury funds. The ability to use these 
funds to cover the long-term costs of treat-
ing AMD will be vital to keeping that burden 
off future generations. 
Much like traditional AML projects, treat-
ing AMD benefits both the environment and 
the economy. Building and operating AMD 
treatment systems helps facilitate the cre-
ation of permanent jobs while cleaning up 
our rivers and streams—a true win-win for 
all West Virginians. 
Over the past four years, people from 
across the country and all over the world 
have finally discovered what a great place 
West Virginia is to live, work, and play. 
They want to kayak and fish in our pristine 
waters and hike in our beautiful mountains. 
Passing this legislation will ensure that 
West Virginia’s resources will be protected 
and enjoyed by all citizens for years to come. 
Sincerely, 
JIM JUSTICE, 
Governor. 
MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF 
THE ENVIRONMENT, 
Baltimore, MD, May 10, 2022. 
Hon. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SENATOR VAN HOLLEN: I am writing 
to ask for your support of S. 3957, the Safe-
guarding Treatment for the Restoration of 
Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act 
(STREAMS), and its companion bill, H.R. 
7283. These bills clarify that states with acid 
mine drainage (AMD) set-aside programs, 
like Maryland, can deposit a portion of the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
(IIJA), Abandoned Mine Land (AML) grant 
funds into state’s AMD set-aside accounts. 
This authority will improve our nation’s 
water quality by providing funding for AMD 
treatment projects as well as the long-term 
operation and maintenance of treatment sys-
tems. 
Western Maryland has a rich history of 
coal mining that began more than 250 years 
ago and helped fuel the industrial revolution. 
Hundreds of millions of tons of coal were 
mined prior to the passage of state and fed-
eral laws requiring land and water reclama-
tion. The Surface Mining Control and Rec-
lamation Act (SMCRA or the Act) of 1977 in-
stituted national mining and reclamation 
standards that have reduced environmental 
impacts from modern coal mining. SMCRA 
also created the Abandoned Mine Reclama-
tion Fund, by taxing coal production, to ad-
dress the legacy of health, safety, and envi-
ronmental hazards that existed prior to pas-
sage of the Act. 
The IIJA has significantly increased fund-
ing available for AML programs by depos-
iting $11.3 billion into the Abandoned Mine 
Reclamation Fund to address the myriad of 
legacy health, safety, and environmental 
hazards of coal mining. 
An important aspect to restoring aban-
doned mines is remediating AMD, which is 
caused by groundwater and surface water 
flowing through abandoned deep mines and 
surface mines resulting in very acidic water 
with high concentrations of dissolved met-
als. Maryland currently has 60 AMD treat-
ment systems that have improved or re-
stored over 100 miles of stream, but hundreds 
of miles of streams remain degraded. Treat-
ing AMD is costly and requires long-term 
funding for operation and maintenance of 
the treatment systems. Without continued 
funding for operation and maintenance, the 
improvements will quickly be lost as the 
streams revert to their pretreatment status. 
S. 3957 and H.R. 7283 would clarify that 
states with approved AMD set-aside pro-
grams can deposit up to 30% of annual IIJA 
grant funds into the AMD set-aside account. 
This legislation is imperative to Maryland, 
along with 10 other states in the Appa-
lachian and the Midwest regions who are 
committed to addressing the legacy of coal 
mining. The legislation provides the flexi-
bility and long-term financial stability nec-
essary to plan, design, build, operate, and 
maintain critical acid mine drainage treat-
ment systems. 
Thank you for your attention to this im-
portant issue of improving water quality in 
Maryland and ask for your support of this 
legislation. 
Sincerely, 
TYLER ABBOTT, 
Chief of Staff. 
ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF 
NATURAL RESOURCES, 
Springfield, Illinois, April 21, 2022. 
Hon. RICHARD DURBIN, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
SENATOR
DURBIN: The Abandoned 
Mine Land (AML) program for the state of Il-
linois is under the purview of the Illinois De-
partment of Natural Resources. I am writing 
to express our continuing strong support for 
the AML program under the Surface Mining 
Control 
and 
Reclamation 
Act 
of 
1977 
(SMCRA). 
As you may know, Section 40701 of the re-
cently adopted Bipartisan Infrastructure 
Law (BIL) transfers funds to the Illinois 
Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Division for 
use in addressing the adverse impacts of coal 
mining that preceeded SMCRA. An impor-
tant aspect of the work is the remediation of 
acid mine drainage (AMD). Treatment of 
AMD requires the construction, operation, 
maintenance and rehabilitation of a treat-
ment system to remain effective, resulting 
in a long-term liability. The historic fee- 
based AML program allows up to 30 percent 
of its annual AML grant in an interest-bear-
ing account to cover the long-term costs of 
AMD. However, the BIL does not confer par-
allel authority. Without this authority, the 
amount available for long-term liabilities 
will dwindle, thereby limiting AMD treat-
ment. 
Therefore, I am requesting your support 
for S. 3957, to amend the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act to make certain ac-
tivities eligible for grants from the Aban-
doned Mine Reclamation Fund, which was 
introduced by Senator Bob Casey and Sen-
ator Mike Braun to allow not more than 30 
percent of the total amount of the BIL grant 
to be deposited into an AMD fund. 
I have attached a summary about the im-
portance of the AMD Set Aside Authority 
and S. 3957, STREAM Act. Should you have 
any questions or require additional informa-
tion about the valuable work our state has 
undertaken, please contact Lance Range, 
Acting Manager of the Division of AML. 
Thank you for your consideration of this 
request to protect the physical, environ-
mental, and economic health of the people of 
Illinois. 
Sincerely, 
COLLEEN CALLAHAN, 
Director. 
TROUT UNLIMITED, 
Arlington, VA, June 8, 2022. 
Re Trout Unlimited supports H.R. 7283, Safe-
guarding Treatment for the Restoration 
of Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines 
Act (the STREAM Act). 
Hon. ALAN LOWENTHAL, 
Chair, House Natural Resources Committee, En-
vironment and Mineral Resources Sub-
committee.

Ranking Member, House Natural Resources 
Committee, Environment and Mineral Re-

LOWENTHAL, 
RANKING
MEMBER 
STAUBER
AND
MEMBERS
OF
THE
SUB-
COMMITTEE: On behalf of our 300,000 members 
and supporters nationwide, Trout Unlimited 
(TU) writes in support of the bipartisan Safe-
guarding Treatment for the Restoration of 
Ecosystems from Abandoned Mines Act 
(STREAM Act) to finance long term cleanup 
of abandoned coal mines. This bill will help 
finance and sustain the outstanding work 
that is happening in coal country to clean up 
pernicious pollution from abandoned coal 
mines. It will extend and enhance the great 
value of the AML provisions of the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) by 
assuring projects completed using those 
funds will continue to provide restoration in 
perpetuity. 
Abandoned Mine Drainage (AMO) treat-
ment is often addressed by building water 
treatment systems, which result in ongoing 
Operation Maintenance and Replacement 
(OMR) costs that endure in perpetuity. How-
ever, states often lack the financial ability 
to support these types of long-term liabil-
ities. If enacted, H.R. 7283 would allow for up 
to 30 percent of a state’s annual allocation 
for Abandoned Mineland (AML) reclamation 
under IIJA to be deposited into an interest- 
bearing account to provide for the perpetual 
OMR expenses of facilities to treat AMO. 
This language mirrors the authority of cur-
rent state programs that allow a 30 percent 
set-aside from the Surface Mining Control 
and Reclamation Act’s (SMCRA) AML Trust 
Fund. This approach will help to ensure that 
projects funded by the IIJA will have funds 
for this necessary long-term OM&R expense, 
thereby sustaining long term the thousands 
of stream miles that will be restored by AMO 
treatment. 
A recent study by TU demonstrated the 
long-term benefits of ongoing cleanup work 
funded by SMCRA’s AML Fund, recently re-
authorized and expanded substantially by 
the IIJA. On the West Branch of the Susque-
hanna River in Pennsylvania, thanks to 
AML funding and well-crafted projects by 
watershed groups, the state, and Trout Un-
limited, we are seeing watershed scale bene-
fits—hundreds 
of 
miles 
of 
stream 
and 
mainstem river restored, recreation rejuve-
nated, jobs created, and watersheds made 
more resilient and better able to withstand 
the impacts of a changing climate. And this 
is but one example of this restoration occur-
ring throughout Appalachia, much of it in 
areas rendered dead by mining that occurred 
decades to over a hundred years ago. 
Without the authority to set aside IIJA 
monies for the perpetual Operation Mainte-
nance and Replacement of these facilities, 
communities and ecosystems impacted by 
legacy mining issues are given the gift of 
restoration with no certainty that it will 
continue in perpetuity. This legislation pro-
vides a critical piece of the puzzle assuring

that future generations will continue to reap 
these benefits. 
Thank you for taking up this important 
legislation and for considering our views. We 
look forward to working with bill sponsors 
and members of the committee to advance 
this bill into law. 
Sincerely, 
STEVE MOYER, 
Vice President of Government Affairs. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Representative 
CARTWRIGHT, for introducing this im-
portant 
bipartisan 
legislation 
and 
working to build such an impressive 
coalition of support. I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 7283, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of 
H.R. 7283, the Safeguarding Treatment 
for the Restoration of Ecosystems from 
Abandoned Mines Act, also known as 
the STREAM Act. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act appropriated $11.3 billion to 
the Abandoned Mine Lands, or the 
AML, trust fund. This money is for use 
by State AML programs to address 
abandoned mine lands created before 
enactment of the Surface Mining Con-
trol and Reclamation Act of 1977. 
This historic, fee-based AML pro-
gram allows a State to set aside up to 
30 percent of its annual AML grant in 
an interest-bearing account to cover 
the long-term costs of acid mine drain-
age, or AMD, facilities, which are often 
needed to address water treatment in 
historic coal mining states. 
The Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act reauthorizes the collection of 
the AML fee at a reduced rate, as well 
as a 30 percent set-aside authority for 
States. However, the IIJA neglected to 
grant parallel set-aside authority for 
the newly authorized $11.3 billion in 
Treasury funds for AML projects. 
This is one of the many areas Con-
gress will need to correct in the hastily 
passed IIJA bill, and it goes to show 
why we need to have regular order, why 
we need to have committee hearings, 
and why we need to take our time on 
these large bills. 
That large IIJA bill never went 
through a committee in the House. It 
was sent over from the Senate, hastily 
adopted, and here we are today, trying 
to fix it. I am sure it won’t be the last 
time. 
The STREAM Act is a bipartisan bill 
that will make a technical fix to IIJA, 
clarifying that States receiving newly 
authorized funds for AML cleanup have 
the authority to set aside a portion of 
those funds for AMD cleanup purposes 
consistent with existing law. This will 
allow States to utilize AML funds ac-
cording to their specific needs. 
That said, the Department of the In-
terior recently released final guidance 
for States applying to receive funds au-
thorized for AML cleanup that includes 
requirements over and above the letter 
of the law. DOI should allow States to 
make decisions on prioritizing AML 
sites and refrain from imposing unau-
thorized and heavy-handed require-
ments. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
CARTWRIGHT). 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from California 
for yielding time. 
I am addressing H.R. 7283, the Safe-
guarding Treatment for the Restora-
tion of Ecosystems from Abandoned 
Mines Act, or the STREAM Act. It has 
been accurately described up to now as 
a responsible, commonsense, technical 
fix to the Department of the Interior’s 
Abandoned Mine Lands Reclamation 
Program. It is a small change, but it 
will have a large, long-lasting, positive 
effect on State efforts to clean up leg-
acy pollution from coal mining. 
Specifically, the bill allows States to 
hold back 30 percent of existing alloca-
tions 
for 
long-term 
operating 
and 
maintenance costs of abandoned mine 
land reclamation. 
When rainwater and river water runs 
over oxidized pyrite in abandoned coal 
mines, it turns color, and the whole 
area becomes toxic. The damage can 
last for hundreds or even thousands of 
years if nothing is done to fix it. 
In my beautiful State of Pennsyl-
vania, acid mine drainage, or AMD, af-
fects over 5,000 miles of waterways. No 
one wants to live or work near these 
dead zones in rivers and streams. 
The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat 
Commission estimates an annual loss 
of $29 million in revenue from rec-
reational fishing in such areas. 
We know how to fix the problem. 
Cleaning up acid mine drainage always 
creates jobs, brings back recreation op-
portunities, boosts local economies, 
and makes communities healthier and 
stronger and much more attractive to 
visitors and new investments. 
Acid mine drainage requires costly, 
ongoing maintenance, and H.R. 7283 
helps pay for that ongoing mainte-
nance. It is not a new idea. The legacy 
Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation 
Program, which has been on the books 
for years, currently allows States to 
set aside up to 30 percent of their an-
nual regular abandoned mine lands al-
location to cover the long-term costs of 
operating AMD treatment facilities 
and maintaining them over the long 
term. 
It is optional, and States have to 
enact their own programs to engage in 
the program. Eleven States have done 
so, so far. Pennsylvania, West Virginia, 
Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Mis-
souri, Maryland, Virginia, Tennessee, 
and Alabama have chosen to do so. 
H.R. 7283 opens the innovation door 
by making up to 30 percent of all AML 
funds available for such acid mine 
drainage projects if States want to go 
that way. 
There is no mandate here. It is their 
choice. Nothing in current law or the 
STREAM Act is mandatory, and noth-
ing in the bill raises or authorizes any 
additional Federal spending for aban-
doned mine land or acid mine drainage 
work. 
What it gives States is the important 
option of restoring waterways and 
maintaining those restoration projects 
for many years to come. 
It is a responsible way to spend this 
money by extending it out over time so 
that we don’t blow it all at once and 
then let existing mine reclamation 
areas fall apart. The STREAM Act can 
take existing Federal allocations for 
AML cleanup and make it last a very 
long time. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking 
member for his support. I thank Rep-
resentative MCKINLEY, to be sure, for 
his leadership in the House on this ef-
fort, and I thank all the other bipar-
tisan cosponsors of this bill. Mr. 
Speaker, I urge all Members to support 
the bill. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
West Virginia (Mr. MCKINLEY), who is 
the Republican lead on this legislation 
and who is also a fellow engineer and 
knows a lot about coal mining. 
Mr. 
MCKINLEY. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman-in-waiting for the 
opportunity to address this. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the 
STREAM Act. Over the last century, 
American companies have mined coal 
in at least 26 States across the country. 
Over that same period of time, thou-
sands of these mines have ceased oper-
ation. 
Abandoned mines produce acid drain-
age that, unfortunately, flows into our 
streams and is toxic. As a result, tens 
of thousands of miles of streams and 
waterways across America are being 
poisoned. 
West Virginia alone, according to the 
West Virginia Department of Environ-
mental Protection, has indicated that 
we have 1,500 miles of streams that are 
toxic in West Virginia. 
The STREAM Act ensures States 
have the flexibility to use these feder-
ally allocated funds for acid mine 
drainage cleanup and provides long- 
term maintenance of these cleanup 
projects. The bill preserves the use of 
important guidelines already in place, 
as you have heard, and simply extends 
them to recently approved new funding 
measures. 
Making our streams safe is not a par-
tisan issue. Mr. Speaker, as chairman 
of the Congressional Coal Caucus, I am 
proud to be leading the Republican ef-
fort, in conjunction with Representa-
tive CARTWRIGHT, to pass this bipar-
tisan legislation. 
For anyone who has never seen these 
orange, poisoned streams, they will 
never understand the gravity of the sit-
uation. But for those of us that have 
seen and lived with this devastation 
that will last for years, decades, into 
the future, the time to vote ‘‘yes’’ is 
now. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the 
STREAM Act, and I encourage a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote.

The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LOWENTHAL) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the measure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
5093, the Wind River Administrative 
Site Conveyance Act. This bill would 
authorize the U.S. Forest Service to 
convey a 23.4-acre portion of the Wind 
River Nursery to Skamania County, 
Washington. 
Congress authorized a land exchange 
that included a large portion of the 
Wind River Nursery in 2001. The con-
veyance authorized by this legislation 
will complete the transfer and place 
the entire Wind River property under 
the stewardship of the county. 
This 
legislation 
will 
allow 
the 
Skamania County Board of Commis-
sioners to continue rehabilitation of 
the buildings and the grounds in the 
Wind River Historic District. 
The bill also includes important and 
routine safeguards so the property will 
continue to be managed in a manner 
that ensures the preservation of its his-
toric characteristics. 
I thank the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington (Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER) for in-
troducing this important legislation 
and championing this bill on behalf of 
her constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of 
H.R. 5093, sponsored by the gentle-
woman from Washington (Ms. HERRERA 
BEUTLER). This is a good bill, and I 
commend her for her leadership on this 
effort. 
Skamania County in Representative 
HERRERA BEUTLER’s district is almost 
77 percent federally owned. Unfortu-
nately, because of the large number of 
public lands in the county, less than 2 
percent of the county’s land base can 
be taxed at full market value. 
The presence of a large Federal es-
tate is shared by many other rural 
counties in the West, and it makes it 
very difficult for communities to gen-
erate revenue needed to fund schools, 
roads, and vital public services, such as 
police and fire departments. 
H.R. 5093 would transfer ownership of 
approximately 23 acres of the former 
Wind River Nursery from the Forest 
Service to the county to expand uses 
that will draw in tourism, provide eco-
nomic opportunities, and create addi-
tional tax revenue for the county. The 
county estimates that this conveyance 
will ultimately lead to an additional 
$600,000 in revenue each year.

Skamania County has also already 
made considerable investments to re-
store this site with upgrades to water 
mains, full restorations to two residen-
tial buildings, and electric improve-
ments to four additional buildings. 
I, again, thank the gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER) for her leadership on this 
bill. The legislation reflects a locally 
driven compromise that meets the 
needs of the community, creates addi-
tional recreation opportunities, and 
will lead to better management of Fed-
eral land. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time. I am 
prepared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER). 
Ms. 
HERRERA 
BEUTLER. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
bill, the Wind River Administrative 
Site Conveyance Act which, if we get it 
passed today by the House and signed 
into law, will provide enormous bene-
fits to the folks I serve in Skamania 
County, Washington. 
This 
bill 
exemplifies 
a 
groundbreaking win-win agreement in 
a rural county where so often locals’ 
needs get completely trampled by the 
Federal Government. 
With this carefully negotiated solu-
tion, the Forest Service unloads land 
that it no longer wants to manage, and 
the local community gains a very valu-
able economic asset and resource. 
In Skamania County, where 80 per-
cent of the land is locked up by the 
Federal Government, even more if you 
count the State-owned land, only 1.8 
percent of the land in the county is 
taxed at full market value. 
What does that mean? 
It means that this has severely hin-
dered the county’s ability to fund basic 
services that citizens rely upon, like 
roads and schools, and police and fire 
protection. 
The bill that I have introduced and 
that we are considering today is sim-
ple. It would convey ownership of ap-
proximately 23 acres in the former 
Wind River Nursery from the U.S. For-
est Service to Skamania County. It is 
important to note here that this pro-
posal is supported by Skamania County 
and by the Forest Service. 
The Gifford Pinchot National Forest, 
which covers a majority of the county, 
is currently facing tens of millions of 
dollars in deferred maintenance. 
By conveying the land to the county, 
the Forest Service will shed that finan-
cial responsibility for these pieces as-
sociated 
with 
the 
maintenance 
of 
buildings and facilities on the Wind 
River Nursery, and by taking owner-
ship of the land, Skamania County will 
develop recreational, historical, and 
business opportunities that will draw 
in tourism and critical revenue. 
This is a win-win solution, and it will 
result in substantial benefits to the 
folks who call Skamania County home. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to ap-
prove this important legislation. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
have had the opportunity to visit 
Skamania County. It is a beautiful 
place, and I know that the people there 
will be great stewards of this land. It 
will be good for Skamania County, for 
Washington, and for the United States, 
and I urge adoption of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support the leg-
islation, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LOWENTHAL) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5093, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
INCLUDING 
CERTAIN 
COMPUTER- 
RELATED 
PROJECTS 
IN 
THE 
FEDERAL 
PERMITTING 
PRO-
GRAM UNDER TITLE XLI OF THE 
FAST ACT 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
3451) to include certain computer-re-
lated projects in the Federal permit-
ting program under title XLI of the 
FAST Act, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3451 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. FEDERAL PERMITTING IMPROVE-
MENT. 
Section 41001(6)(A) of the FAST Act (42 
U.S.C. 4370m(6)(A)) is amended, in the matter 
preceding clause (i), by inserting ‘‘semi-
conductors, artificial intelligence and ma-
chine learning, high-performance computing 
and advanced computer hardware and soft-
ware, quantum information science and tech-
nology, data storage and data management, 
cybersecurity,’’ after ‘‘manufacturing,’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. COSTA) and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Arkansas 
(Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 20 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense 
bill that I believe has bipartisan sup-
port involving the construction of chip 
manufacturing and other computer-re-
lated manufacturing rights here in the 
United States. Obviously, this is a big 
effort that has been ongoing in Con-
gress for some time. 
The bill here simply adds key na-
tional 
security-related 
technologies, 
like semiconductors, to the types of 
projects that are eligible for an exist-
ing Federal program that improves the 
coordination between Federal depart-
ments on permitting. We oftentimes, as 
we know, have difficulty in getting the 
permitting process to work, and it cre-
ates delays in process. It not only 
takes time, but it increases costs. So 
this is an effort to try to address that. 
The bill passed the Senate unani-
mously back in January. Sending this 
bill to the President will build on the 
progress we are already making today 
with the CHIPS and Science Act. 
Both bills are critical to America 
leading in manufacturing of chips. We 
know that it is the future of the 21st 
century economy that creates good 
jobs and ensures our competitiveness 
in the global economy that we live in. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House’s adop-
tion of this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of 
S. 3451. However, when we start sacri-
ficing regular order to score political 
points, we are on an extremely slippery 
slope. Unfortunately, that is the course 
this bill sets us on. 
It didn’t move through the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources, the com-
mittee of jurisdiction. Instead, it was 
one of the many promises made by 
Democrat leadership to secure the 
votes they needed in the Senate to pass 
the CHIPS-Plus Act. 
The irony of this, Mr. Speaker, is 
yesterday we were in an all-day long 
markup in the Natural Resources Com-
mittee on Chairman GRIJALVA’s Envi-
ronmental Justice for All Act, which is 
a bill that really doubles down on 
NEPA regulations. Obviously, we have 
differences of opinion on that, but we 
were having the debate. Democrats 
wanted to increase NEPA regulations, 
Republicans wanted to streamline reg-
ulations. 
So you can imagine the shock when 
Chairman GRIJALVA’s staff, almost si-
multaneously with my staff, told us to 
be prepared tomorrow afternoon be-
cause there is going to be a NEPA 
streamlining bill on the suspension cal-
endar. 
When I was told the bill was being 
added, I thought to myself, this bill 
didn’t go through regular order, and 
this is something my colleagues across 
the aisle would normally really be op-
posed to. So I Googled the bill, and it 
turns out that S. 3451 is but a bar-
gaining chip in the larger CHIPS de-
bate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7401 
July 28, 2022 
This is what I found on the internet. 
It said, ‘‘From yesterday’s Roll Call, as 
they reported on the CHIPS-Plus pack-
age.’’ A quote from that is: ‘‘One of the 
Republicans who voted for the bill . . . 
had sought an amendment to fast track 
the permitting process for companies 
building semiconductor plants . . . in-
stead he was promised that the House 
would clear his Senate-passed bill.’’ 
This legislation, S. 3451, provides 
modest permit streamlining to expe-
dite reviews of infrastructure projects 
concerning semiconductors, artificial 
intelligence 
and 
machine 
learning, 
high-performance computing and ad-
vanced computer hardware and soft-
ware, quantum information science and 
technology, data storage, and data 
management, or cybersecurity. 
b 1645 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
strongly 
support 
streamlining. In fact, for the last 18 
months, Republicans on the Committee 
on Natural Resources have been calling 
to move legislation that would stream-
line the onerous NEPA process, cut bu-
reaucratic red tape, and fight back 
against environmental activist liti-
gants, the kinds of meaningful actions 
Congress needs to take to move our 
country forward. 
I woke up this morning, and I was 
reading online my local newspaper 
back home. There was actually a story 
about the CHIPS Act that talked about 
this very bill that we have on the sus-
pension calendar today. I found it in-
teresting that someone from the Sierra 
Club was interviewed about it. 
Now, normally if you are going to 
streamline NEPA, it sets Sierra Club’s 
hair on fire, and they are calling all of 
their activists and putting alerts out. 
But it was interesting that on this one, 
the Sierra Club was going to study the 
text a little bit more, even though we 
are here this afternoon passing this on 
suspension. 
These commonsense Republican solu-
tions are crucial to improving the 
health of our Federal lands, repairing 
our 
crumbling 
infrastructure, 
con-
structing water storage projects needed 
to make our Western communities 
more resilient to drought, and devel-
oping America’s domestic resources to 
secure our supply chain and our coun-
try. 
In response, Democrats have repeat-
edly told us we were gutting bedrock 
environmental laws, and that we sup-
port pillaging the land from sea to 
shining sea. 
Just yesterday, I spent, as I men-
tioned, over 10 hours in a Committee 
on Natural Resources markup where 
the Democrats advanced a bill—we not 
only debated it; we marked it up and 
advanced it—a bill to expand NEPA, 
create more burdensome red tape, and 
handcuff our great Nation from future 
development. 
Now, today, after years of committee 
Republicans hearing how we are trying 
to destroy America, suddenly the exact 
same commonsense streamlining and 
reasonable sideboards on frivolous liti-
gation are necessary to build semicon-
ductor plants and America’s future. 
This bill is only part of the solution. 
While building domestic chip manufac-
turing facilities is important and we 
want to bring those jobs to the United 
States for American workers, the re-
ality is there is not much domestic 
about a chip made with 100 percent for-
eign materials. 
For 
instance, 
today, 
the 
United 
States is 100 percent reliant on other 
countries to meet our demand for 
gallium and indium, both of which are 
needed in semiconductors. China is the 
lead supplier for both. 
Semiconductors also require a min-
eral called bismuth, 90 percent of which 
the U.S. imports. Again, China is the 
lead supplier to the U.S. of bismuth. 
Semiconductors are among dozens of 
high-tech commodities, such as sat-
ellites, electric vehicles, and missile 
defense systems reliant on mineral re-
sources to function. China unquestion-
ably controls the market on nearly 
every one of the necessary minerals. 
If we truly want to secure the supply 
chain for semiconductors and the huge 
array of other products dependent on 
critical minerals, it is imperative to 
ensure a robust domestic mining indus-
try through an efficient, predictable 
mine permitting system here in the 
United States. 
While the bill before us is a step in 
the right direction, it does not address 
the supply chain necessary to build our 
domestic 
high-tech 
manufacturing 
technology. 
Republicans have the solutions. To 
name a few: H.R. 2604, the Accessing 
America’s Critical Mineral Act, intro-
duced by Congressman PETE STAUBER, 
reforms onerous and duplicative steps 
in the critical mineral permitting proc-
ess by requiring Federal agencies to ad-
here to timelines and improve coordi-
nation. 
H.R. 2637, the American Critical Min-
erals Independence Act, introduced by 
Congressmen MICHAEL WALTZ and PAUL 
GOSAR, 
invests 
in 
recycling 
tech-
nologies and innovative mining and 
processing techniques, streamlines the 
permitting of critical minerals produc-
tion, and requires that agencies ana-
lyze the mineral potential of Federal 
lands. 
If Democrats were serious about 
streamlining and promoting a robust 
domestic 
manufacturing 
sector 
for 
semiconductors and other high-tech ap-
plications, they would be bringing 
these bills and others to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 3451 is a modest step 
in the right direction, and I support 
the passage of this bill. Now that it ap-
pears Democrats have seen the error of 
their ways and they suddenly have 
done a 180 on streamlining environ-
mental bureaucracy, I look forward to 
working with each and every Member 
who votes for this bill to advance many 
other Republican solutions to further 
address streamlining and secure a ro-
bust domestic critical minerals supply 
chain. 
Unfortunately, while I would like to 
say that, with Democrats’ newfound 
support of streamlining, the remaining 
Republican solutions will be coming to 
the floor quickly, something tells me 
Democrats’ willingness to ignore envi-
ronmental extremists and bring up 
commonsense policy solutions like S. 
3451 has a lot more to do with politics 
than making good policy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge adoption of this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, clearly, I 
think there is an agreement that 
America needs to increase its produc-
tion of critical minerals for the econ-
omy of the 21st century. I think often-
times there are differences on how we 
establish a framework and a goal in 
terms of the production of those crit-
ical minerals. 
I think that there is support on both 
sides of the aisle for streamlining the 
permitting process that is reflected in 
this bill, and, clearly, I appreciate the 
efforts and the comments of my col-
league, the gentleman from Arkansas. 
Obviously, we have more work to do, 
and this is a good bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge the House’s adop-
tion, and I yield the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
COSTA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3451. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it.

ant to clause 8 of rule XX, further pro-
ceedings on this motion will be post-

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Arizona? 
There was no objection. 
f 
DEMOCRATS 
ARE 
WORKING 
TO 
LOWER 
COSTS 
FOR 
WORKING 
FAMILIES 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to celebrate House Democrats’ ef-
forts to lower costs for working fami-
lies across America. 
For months now, Democrats and the 
President have been working closely 
together to lower the prices of gas for 
Americans. We have focused on peo-
ple’s pocketbooks, not politics. 
As a result, gas prices have been de-
creasing for 5 straight weeks, down 
around 70 cents since last month. In 
fact, $3.99 a gallon is the most common 
price in America today. Mr. Speaker, I 
saw the $3.99, and lower, in the Houston 
area over the weekend. 
On average, drivers are saving $35 per 
month. For residents in my district, 
this can mean the difference between a 
warm family meal or going hungry. 
While Republicans in Congress have 
no solutions to lower prices and remain 
focused on other matters, like strip-
ping 
women 
of 
their 
reproductive 
rights, House Democrats will continue 
delivering results for the American 
people. We are the party that puts peo-
ple over politics. 
f 
OPPOSING THE LEFT’S ANTI-LIFE 
AGENDA 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, radical pro-
gressives will stop at nothing to ad-
vance their agenda of murdering the 
unborn. 
On July 15, on this very floor, the 
majority rushed through two horren-
dous pieces of legislation that directly 
target the unborn: the abortion on de-
mand until birth act and the so-called 
Ensuring Access to Abortion Act. 
The right to life is guaranteed by the 
14th Amendment to the Constitution, 
and the majority continues to conven-
iently ignore this fact. This shameful 
chapter 
of 
murdering 
the 
unborn 
should be consigned to the ash heap of 
history. 
Mr. Speaker, an outright denial of 
life for the most vulnerable, who can-
not speak for themselves, is in no way 
justified. I will always serve as a voice 
for the unborn. They deserve nothing 
less than unwavering advocates. 
f 
HIGH INFLATION IS CAUSED BY 
HIGH SPENDING 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we all 
know that inflation is the big topic on 
people’s tongues nowadays, but what 
we can’t let people forget is that high 
inflation is caused by high spending. 
Now, what did Congress do after re-
turning to this floor this week and 
spending the weekend hearing people 
complain about high gas prices, but 
even more high housing prices, high 
food prices? They passed the CHIPS bill 
today for $76 billion. 
Now, I know why they thought they 
could vote for a $76 billion bill. They 
thought the public wouldn’t know the 
difference between $76 billion and $76 
million. $76 billion is $230 for every 
man, woman, and child in this country. 
If you are a family of four, Congress 
just spent $1,000 of your money and 
didn’t think anything about it. 
Now, the other thing that bothers me 
about it is, I like to look out for the 
average guy. Who owns these chip com-
panies? The uber wealthy. Seventy-six 
billion dollars toward the uber wealthy 
and corporate welfare. 
A lot of people think the majority 
party likes to freely spend money for 
welfare, for the people who don’t work. 
And that is true; they do. What is not 
as known is they love to spend money 
on the uber wealthy as well. 
Every newspaper in the country 
ought to have a banner headline in the 
morning: ‘‘$76 billion spent again by 
Congress.’’ 
f 
ADDRESSING THE DROUGHT AND 
WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, the people 
and communities of California’s San 
Joaquin Valley have been dealing with 
devastating 
drought 
conditions 
for 
years. 
Water is life, as we say, agua es vida. 
A reliable, sustainable water supply 
is absolutely essential to put America’s 
food on our dinner table. It is a na-
tional security issue. Think about it. 
We can’t live without food. Without 
water, we cannot grow food. 
Farmers in my district are feeling 
the impact of the drought firsthand. 
Many have fallowed land, sadly. It is 
becoming more and more difficult to 
grow food and maintain farmland. 
It is really simple. We say back 
home: Where water flows, food grows. 
Small businesses are struggling to 
survive. Residents suffer from declin-
ing air quality, spurred by dust and 
wildfires that continue to spread across 
the West. 
We must confront the devastating 
impacts of climate change. The Wild-
fire and Drought Resiliency Act will 
improve drought resiliency and protect 
the giant sequoia trees that are part of 
America’s natural heritage. 
Without a doubt, we cannot wait to 
confront this issue. We must act now.

RECOGNIZING NICK ELLIS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Wayne 
County school system’s Nick Ellis for 
his induction into the Boys & Girls 
Clubs Hall of Fame. 
Nick has been working with the Boys 
& Girls Clubs for 16 years. After grad-
uating high school in 2006, Nick began 
working with the Boys & Girls Clubs of 
Altamaha Area as a volunteer, then as 
a unit director, before rising to board 
membership. Today, he also serves as 
the area’s chief volunteer officer. 
Throughout his time with the club, 
Nick has been a positive influence in 
the lives of countless children, pro-
viding support and leadership to those 
in need. 
Nick also serves his community as a 
law enforcement officer with the Jesup 
Police Department. In his 12 years with 
the 
department, 
Nick 
has 
risen 
through the ranks and currently serves 
as patrol division commander. 
In 2020, Governor Brian Kemp recog-
nized Nick’s efforts in law enforcement 
and appointed Nick to serve on the 
Georgia Board of Public Safety. 
A passionate volunteer dedicated to 
helping his community beyond his pro-
fessional career, Nick Ellis is a shining 
example of leadership and guidance for 
everyone. He is fully deserving of this 
hall of fame induction honor.

THE ENERGY CRISIS 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, last week 
President Biden announced a series of 
executive orders to further advance his 
party’s Green New Deal agenda. This is 
further proof of an utterly out-of-touch 
administration. 
The average cost of a gallon of gas is 
$3.93 in Tennessee, almost double the 
price when the President took office. 
Most Americans will spend thousands 
more this year on filling up their 
tanks. 
Families are also paying an average 
of $90 a month more for electricity this 
summer. In addition, reports say our 
Nation faces looming blackouts—yet 
this administration is doubling down 
on regulating our energy producers to 
death. 
The solution is simple: The President 
should be supporting policies that 
ramp up domestic oil production, rath-
er than policies that destroy it. 
Mr. Biden has blamed oil companies, 
gas station owners, and everyone else 
for this disaster, but if he wants to as-
sign blame, he need look no further 
than the mirror.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
minutes ago, new data confirmed what 
a supermajority of Americans already 
knew: Democrats have plunged Amer-
ica into a recession. According to offi-
cial statistics, the U.S. economy just 
shrank for the second consecutive 
quarter. Democrats inherited an econ-
omy that was primed for a historic 
comeback and promptly ran it straight 
into the ground. 
Of course, working families didn’t 
need any experts or statistics to tell 
them today’s Democratic Party is a 
walking, talking economic disaster. 
Democrats’ failures are causing work-
ing families deep personal pain on a 
daily basis. 
Americans know Democrats can’t be 
trusted. They know it every time they 
fill the gas tank, every time they 
check out at the supermarket, every 
time parents stay up late at the kitch-
en table trying to figure out which 
bills they can afford to pay this par-
ticular month. 
Because Democrats spent us into in-
flation, 90 million American house-
holds say they are having a hard time 
meeting expenses—90 million American 
households. The average household in 
this country is having to pay an extra 
$5,300 and climbing every year just to 
tread water. Democrats’ inflation is 
stealing more than $5,000 from the av-
erage family per year, and like a super-
majority of Americans already knew 
before this morning, it has now driven 
the country into a recession. 
A few years back, our colleague the 
senior Senator from West Virginia 
said: ‘‘I don’t think [that] during a 
time of recession, you mess with any of 
the taxes, or increase any taxes.’’ But, 
alas, yesterday, Washington Democrats 
announced they plan to do exactly 
that. The Democrats who robbed Amer-
ican families once with inflation now 
want to rob the country a second time 
through a gigantic, gigantic job-killing 
tax hike. 
Apparently, 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues do not want to be responsible 
for just skyrocketing prices alone. 
They want Americans to be faced with 
skyrocketing prices and higher taxes 
and fewer jobs all at the same time. 
Democrats have outlined a giant 
package of huge, new job-killing tax 
hikes, Green New Deal craziness that 
will kill American energy, and pre-
scription drug socialism that will leave 
us with fewer lifesaving medicines—a 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
that will delight the far left and ham-
mer working families even harder. 
The Democrats are going all in on a 
multihundred-billion-dollar tax hike

July 28, 2022 
on American jobs that experts called— 
listen to this—the single most eco-
nomically damaging part of their en-
tire BBB plan from last year. Years of 
research show the burden would be 
overwhelmingly passed down to work-
ers. This one tax hike alone would kill 
tens of thousands of American jobs. 
Democrats aren’t sticking it to the 
fat cats. They are sticking it to the 
same middle-class families they have 
already crushed with inflation. 
So Democrats want to respond to 
their inflation crisis by killing jobs. 
They also want to respond to the glob-
al energy crisis by attacking American 
natural gas. This reckless taxing-and- 
spending spree includes a massive, 
massive new tax on American natural 
gas, our country’s single largest source 
of electricity. 
We all know that when you tax some-
thing, you get less of it, and Democrats 
want new taxes on American natural 
gas wells, new taxes on American pipe-
lines, and new taxes on American LNG 
exporting—higher electricity bills in 
the summer, higher heating bills in the 
winter, less reliable energy for our 
country, and less American energy ex-
ported to our allies abroad; doubling 
down—literally, doubling down—on in-
flation. 
I have only scratched the surface of 
all the ways Democrats want to pick 
Americans’ pockets. They want to pour 
new funding—listen to this—into IRS 
agents so Americans end up with more 
audits. IRS agents get new computers 
and smartphones so that American 
small businesses get more audits. 
Also, 
Democrats 
want 
to 
drain 
money out of medical innovation and 
leave terminally ill Americans with 
fewer real treatments and cures as a 
result. The experts say this Big Gov-
ernment money grab will literally cost 
Americans their lives. 
But, remember, Democrats say all of 
these historic tax hikes are their an-
swer to the inflation they already cre-
ated themselves. 
So do you hear that, America? Demo-
crats’ answer to hurting you once is to 
hurt you again. Democrats say the re-
sponse 
to 
Democratic 
inflation 
is 
Democratic tax hikes. 
It wasn’t enough that Democrats 
have already destroyed your family’s 
purchasing power. Now they want to 
kill your job and tax your electricity 
as well. 
So the natural next question is, What 
do Democrats want to do with all that 
money? What spending spree do the 
Democrats want so badly that they 
will raise taxes in the midst of a reces-
sion? 
Ah, here is the answer: Green New 
Deal nonsense and goodies for rich 
coastal elites. They want these job- 
killing tax hikes so they can spend 
tens of billions of dollars on slush 
funds for ‘‘green banks’’ and ‘‘environ-
mental justice.’’ They want job-killing 
tax hikes so they can finance new 
handouts for wealthy households earn-
ing up to $300,000 a year to buy an 
$80,000 electric car. Let me say that 
again: tax hikes so they can finance 
new handouts for wealthy households 
earning up to $300,000 a year to buy an 
$80,000 electric car. They want to sub-
sidize rich people buying electric cars 
that cost more—more—than the me-
dian American household earns in an 
entire year. 
They want to tax American natural 
gas. They want to tax your electricity 
so they can spend billions making solar 
and wind power look artificially ready 
for prime time when they are not yet— 
billions of dollars so Democrats can 
meddle in what kind of car you drive; 
what kind of stove, hot water heater, 
or clothes dryer you can afford; and 
how you are allowed to heat your 
house. This is the nonsense that Demo-
crats are focused on—not helping you 
put gas in your car, not helping you af-
ford your groceries. 
They want to use the middle-class 
economic crisis they themselves cre-
ated as an excuse to raise your taxes 
and ram through their Green New Deal 
nonsense, all of this liberal waste with 
no proof—none—that any of it would 
lead to a meaningful reduction in glob-
al emissions, much less global tem-
peratures. 
America has already been reducing 
our emissions considerably over the 
last 15 to 20 years. Countries like China 
have just kept on emitting more and 
more, totally washing out our reduc-
tions and then some. Democrats want 
to forcibly reengineer our entire econ-
omy out from under working Ameri-
cans’ feet while China keeps on emit-
ting more and more. 
Democrats are seeing American fami-
lies the worst inflation in 40 years and 
raising them job-killing tax hikes 
and—and—a war on American elec-
tricity. 
Our colleagues across the aisle have 
already completely lost Americans’ 
trust on the economy before this reck-
less taxing-and-spending spree. Appar-
ently, they now want to see how much 
farther they can fall. 
PACT ACT 
Madam President, now on a com-
pletely different matter, yesterday, the 
Senate should have been able to clear 
bipartisan legislation expanding VA 
benefits for millions of men and women 
who have served bravely in our Armed 
Forces. I appreciate the work our col-
leagues on Veterans’ Affairs have done 
on the PACT Act. I support the sub-
stance of the bill. 
But even on legislation this major 
and this costly, the Democratic leader 
tried to block the Senate from any 
semblance of a fair amendment proc-
ess. Specifically, the senior Senator 
from Pennsylvania has an amendment 
that would ensure we do not just apply 
a financial bandaid to the problem but 
actually fix the underlying accounting 
issue. As written, the legislation would 
not just help America’s veterans as de-
signed. It would also allow Democrats 
to effectively spend the same money 
twice and enable hundreds of billions in 
new, unrelated spending on the discre-
tionary side of the Federal budget. 
There is no excuse why the Demo-
cratic leader should continue to block 
Senator 
TOOMEY’s 
commonsense 
amendment. A bill this important and 
this bipartisan deserves for us to fix 
the accounting gimmick, and then it 
deserves to become law. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, say it 
isn’t so, Joe. 
Yesterday 
afternoon, 
Democrats, 
Senator MANCHIN—JOE MANCHIN from 
West Virginia—and their leadership an-
nounced the latest version of their 
Build Back Better tax-and-spending 
spree, which they are, bizarrely, calling 
the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Now, I have to say that when they 
announced it, I think it certainly 
blindsided the Republicans, but I think 
it also blindsided, I am told, an awful 
lot of Democrats who didn’t know or 
hadn’t been consulted about what was 
going to be in this so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act. 
Let me just tell you a few of the 
things the bill does. It imposes a new 
tax on job creators. It provides funding 
to the IRS to harass small businesses 
and nonprofits. It provides tens of bil-
lions of dollars in tax credits for Green 
New Deal projects and the purchase of 
costly electric vehicles. It extends in-
creased government subsidies for peo-
ple on ObamaCare. 
Well, I think the question you have 
to ask is, What exactly is any of that 
going to do to address inflation? How 
are more IRS audits going to help 
Americans who wonder how they can 
continue to afford to pay more than $4 
a gallon for gas? How is a new tax on 
businesses going to drive down the 
price of chicken or milk or fruits or 
vegetables? 
As for electric vehicle tax credits, 
they might make purchasing an elec-
tric vehicle slightly less painful, but 
that is if you can afford to purchase 
one in the first place, especially in the 
midst of an inflation crisis. These tax 
credits are going to do nothing to cool 
down our overheated economy or bring 
inflation under control. 
Then there is the fact that Demo-
crats are attempting to help sell this 
bill by claiming it is going to help re-
duce the deficit. Well, it is not that I 
am not glad to see Democrats actually 
considering 
deficit 
reduction, 
even 
though their deficit reduction is un-
likely to do much to actually reduce 
the deficit. Perhaps they should have 
thought about deficit reduction last

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3751 
July 28, 2022 
year when they passed a massive, par-
tisan $1.9 trillion spending spree fi-
nanced with deficit spending—a spend-
ing spree, I might add, that overheated 
our economy and helped push us to our 
current inflation crisis, which is the 
biggest inflation that we have seen lit-
erally in 40 years, a 40-year high. 
So we found out, of course, about this 
bill literally hours before we learned 
this morning that for the second quar-
ter in a row, our economy not only 
failed to experience any growth but ac-
tually contracted. And the news was 
not unexpected. There have been signs 
that the economy was weakening for a 
while now. 
But I have to say, as I think about 
that news—the inflation news coupled 
with the fact that the economy is, in 
fact, contracting—that it seems really 
incredible that the prescription for ei-
ther one of those problems in this 
country would be a massive new tax- 
and-spending bill. This bill isn’t going 
to do anything about inflation. It is 
not going to do anything for economic 
growth. In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised 
if this bill’s new tax on businesses ac-
tually slows down parts of our econ-
omy. 
It begs the question about why you 
would need new taxes when the taxes 
that are coming into the Treasury al-
ready are, frankly, at record levels. We 
saw year-over-year increases from the 
last 2 years in the amount of revenues 
coming into the Treasury from taxes 
paid by the American people, increased 
by 18 and 20 percent—18 percent one 
year and 20 percent the next year. 
There have been huge increases in tax 
revenue, in fact, so big, such big in-
creases in tax revenue that the revenue 
generated by the tax owed to this coun-
try as a percentage of our gross domes-
tic product—in other words, as a per-
centage of our total economy—reached 
the highest level since the year 2000, a 
22-year high revenue to GDP. That is 
what has happened in the last couple of 
years. Revenues have been going up. 
Revenues coming from individual in-
come tax returns, from business tax re-
turns, from capital gains taxes all have 
gone up by double digits, and big dou-
ble digits, 18 and 20 percent in the last 
2 years, to the point where revenue to 
GDP is at the highest level that it has 
been literally since the year 2000, 22 
years ago. 
Couple that with the fact that, be-
cause of inflation, which at 9.1 percent 
is the highest we have seen in 40 
years—you have to go back to the time 
when I was literally in high school and 
college to find a time when we saw this 
kind of inflation and the impact that 
has on American families and con-
sumers. So the Joint Economic Com-
mittee did an analysis recently which 
found out that the increase in costs for 
an average American family year over 
year as a result of this level of infla-
tion is about $9,000. 
That is $9,000 more for the same bas-
ket of goods, the same basic necessities 
that Americans bought last year; $9,000 
higher this year, roughly about $700 a 
month. So that is $700 a month out of 
an American family’s budget pocket 
that goes toward nothing more than 
paying the inflation tax. 
So you already have this huge tax on 
American families because of inflation. 
Now you couple that with the fact that 
the economy is slowing down. It is get-
ting a little wobbly. You would think 
just intuitively that when you have an 
economy like that, the last thing you 
would want to do, the very worst pre-
scription for high inflation and slow 
growth would be more taxes and more 
spending, particularly given the fact 
that you even have liberal Democrat 
economists who have said that the $1.9 
trillion spending bill last year contrib-
uted to—was largely responsible for 
this inflation and perhaps one of the 
worst policy decisions ever made. Yes, 
that has been not just Republicans say-
ing that; that has been liberal Demo-
crat economists. 
So in light of that situation, that 
sort of cluster of economic data—slow 
growth, or in this case, negative 
growth, a recession, technically speak-
ing—now, of course, there is a question 
by the administration about what real-
ly constitutes a technical recession, 
but I think if you are an American 
family or an American consumer, you 
know, 9 percent inflation and, you 
know, slow growth in the economy and 
a concern about what the future eco-
nomic outlook is going to look like for 
yourself and your family suggests they 
probably think that we are in a reces-
sion already. I think that is the experi-
ence of most Americans who are deal-
ing with the day-to-day pocketbook 
issues. 
So you have to ask the question, 
again, with higher prices already out 
there and concerns about the economy, 
why more taxes on businesses, which in 
most cases—and people think of tax-
ing—always 
tax 
businesses 
because 
businesses make all this money, they 
are very rich and all that, but what 
happens typically with businesses is, 
obviously, they have to hire employees, 
so if you hit them with a big fat tax 
burden, typically what happens is it re-
sults in lower wages for their employ-
ees or, conversely, it could also result 
in higher prices for consumers, for 
their customers, because that typically 
gets passed on. In most cases, those 
taxes don’t just get eaten or absorbed; 
they get passed on in the economy in 
the form of higher prices or lower 
wages, and there are all kinds of eco-
nomic studies on both sides of the po-
litical equation that show that. 
So the question, again, is why would 
you do this, particularly now, when, in 
fact, what we ought to be doing is fo-
cusing on those solutions that actually 
would reduce inflation, starting with 
reducing 
wasteful, 
out-of-control 
spending? If spending overheated the 
economy in the first place—and, of 
course, the textbook definition of infla-
tion is too many dollars chasing too 
few goods. If that is what we have expe-
rienced in our economy over the past 
several months, then you would think 
you would want, if you are in a hole, to 
quit digging—don’t spend more, don’t 
flood the zone with more dollars out 
there and increase that demand and 
put higher pressure on prices. You 
would think that would be a solution. 
And you would also think that, since 
a lot of inflation has to do with the 
price of energy in this country, that 
you would focus on reducing the price 
of energy rather than increasing the 
price of energy, and this bill does the 
exact opposite. 
It puts taxes—taxes on energy pro-
duction in this country—oil and gas— 
all in the name of and in the interest of 
trying to push people into electric ve-
hicles. 
Now, interestingly enough, when I 
mention 
electric 
vehicles—average 
cost, about $80,000. So when the sugges-
tion is—you know, so gas prices are 
high, fuel prices are high, just go get 
an electric vehicle. Well, when you 
have got 9 percent inflation and a 
wobbly economy, the idea that an aver-
age American person out there or an 
average American family is going to go 
out and drop 80 grand on an electric ve-
hicle seems a little bit far-fetched. 
But, then, it is not just the average 
American family. This incentive to buy 
electric vehicles can be taken, experi-
enced, enjoyed, if you will, by people 
making $300,000 a year—hardly the av-
erage American who is getting hit by 
high gas prices. 
So instead of lowering energy costs 
by increasing more supply, opening up 
Federal lands, you know, approving 
permits to drill, approving infrastruc-
ture projects, encouraging investment 
in energy production in this country 
instead of discouraging it and pres-
suring companies not to invest in en-
ergy production, this has the opposite 
effect. It is going to tax energy. It is 
going to put a tax on energy. 
So you are going to have higher elec-
tricity costs, higher fuel costs—I don’t 
get it. I honestly don’t get it. 
Now, I understand there is a very dis-
tinct difference in this country in po-
litical philosophies and all that, and I 
also know—I have been here long 
enough to know—that when Democrats 
are in power, they tend to grow and ex-
pand government. 
There are—I don’t know, I can’t 
think probably of a spending debate 
that I have been involved with in the 
time that I have been here where 
Democrats haven’t wanted to spend 
more and Republicans haven’t wanted 
to spend less, with one exception, and 
that would be defense. National secu-
rity is always something that seems to 
be on the menu when it comes to cut-
ting government as far as Democrats 
are concerned, but when it comes to

role of government, that sort of thing— 
and these are—I mean, they are philo-
sophical differences, they are ideolog-
ical differences, whatever you want to 
call them, but the fact of the matter is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3752 
July 28, 2022 
that Democrats like to grow and ex-
pand government. They like more gov-
ernment. They like more government 
control. 
And this achieves that in a lot of 
ways. Obviously, it makes people more 
dependent upon government, and par-
ticularly if—when it comes to, you 
know, what you choose to drive, pushes 
people more into electric vehicles. And 
it is government, again, picking win-
ners and losers. But I would also sug-
gest that one of the other provisions in 
the bill locks in policies that socialist 
countries have adopted, places in West-
ern Europe, that fix drug prices. That 
is not something we have done in this 
country. 
And everybody around here says: 
Well, Europe does it, why can’t we do 
it? Well, as I recall, we left Europe for 
that reason. We wanted less govern-
ment control. We wanted more per-
sonal freedom, coupled with individual 
responsibility. That was part, I think, 
of the defining principle of this coun-
try. 
So now we are going to adopt the 
price-fixing policies that have been 
adopted in places in Europe in an at-
tempt to try and get drug costs down 
at the same time we are going to be 
sacrificing the innovation, the invest-
ment, and the ingenuity that has re-
sulted in so many of the great cures 
that we have seen in this country, and 
as recently as a couple years ago with 
COVID, which was a record time in 
terms of getting a vaccine out there 
into circulation that was actually ef-
fective in trying to keep people from 
getting terribly sick with that disease. 
So what this, as far as I can tell, 
does, is it sort of socializes medicine, 
at least to the extent that it pertains 
to the pharmaceutical business. It has 
government fixing prices. It has us 
adopting the European model when it 
comes to drugs. It has us taxing energy 
production here in the United States 
and investing in all kinds of different 
green energy things. 
By the way, $60 billion—$60 billion— 
in this proposal for ‘‘environmental 
justice,’’ defined, evidently, as grants 
to communities who are having a hard 
time keeping up with environmental 
standards in their communities, which, 
again, all of us—and I would argue, in 
my experience here, I have been one of 
the most forward-leaning people when 
it comes to renewable energy, you 
know, coming up with new sources of 
energy that, obviously, not only are 
good for our economy, but benefit our 
environment as well—but $60 billion for 
environmental 
justice, 
nothing 
for 
funding the police or law enforcement 
to keep our communities safe, which is 
a huge, huge crisis in this country. 
So I would just argue that if ever 
there was a time when priorities are 
misplaced, this would have to be it. I 
just can’t think of a way in which any-
thing that is being talked about here 
does anything to address the funda-
mental economic hardship that is being 
experienced by tens of millions of 
Americans; and that is, when they go 
to the gas station to fill up their tank 
with gas, or a farmer who needs diesel, 
which has literally doubled in cost, in 
price, since the President took office, 
or going to the grocery store, where all 
these inflation and energy costs and 
everything else get passed on—every-
thing has gone up. 
Groceries in this country, on aver-
age, up 12 percent, utility gas up 38 per-
cent, gasoline up 60 percent. And that 
is just year over year. If you go since 
the time the President took office, the 
price of gasoline has almost doubled. It 
is 90 percent higher now than it was 
when the President took office. 
And so you have got all this eco-
nomic bad data and hardship and—you 
know, the American people are experi-
encing, and so just kind of out of no-
where, really—I mean, there has been 
some discussion about this, as we all 
know, over the past year or so, but ev-
erybody, I think, kind of concluded 
when we got the inflation numbers last 
month at 9.1 percent, a 40-year high, 
that: Let’s cool it down a little bit. 
Let’s cool our jets here, and let’s just 
see what is going to happen with the 
economy before we do anything rash. 
Well, you can’t say that $1 trillion in 
spending and taxes isn’t pretty rash, 
especially when you try and drive it 
through on a party line vote, the same 
way that the $2 trillion in spending was 
done last year, where you had, again, 
all these warnings, and not just Repub-
licans. I was saying this, but I am not 
unique. There were lots of Democrat 
economists who were suggesting at the 
time that that kind of spending would 
do nothing but overheat the economy, 
overstimulate the economy, and you 
get too many dollars chasing too few 
goods and leading to inflationary im-
pacts, which is ultimately what hap-
pened. 
So here we are, with 9 percent infla-
tion, two quarters now of negative eco-
nomic growth, negative GDP, and 
Democrats saying: OK. Let’s raise 
taxes and let’s raise taxes a bunch, at 
a time when revenues to GDP are at 
their highest level since the year 2000, 
and when we have had two successive 
years now, year over year, of revenue 
growth, 18 percent and 20 percent. 
Surely—surely—the 
problem 
here 
can’t be not enough revenue. The issue, 
I think, is—and it comes back to my 
fundamental point in the first place. 
You want to grow government, you 
want to expand government, you want 
to have $60 billion—$60 billion—going 
to environmental justice and zero 
going to funding the police or address-
ing the issues of law enforcement, 
crime in our communities around this 
country, or maybe putting some money 
toward the border, addressing another 
out-of-control problem that I can see— 
you can point back directly to policy 
decisions made by this administration 
and the ultimate consequence and re-
sult that we have seen, the outcome 
that we have seen. 
But this is going to be done on a 
party line basis. This is going to be 
done with Democrat-only votes and, 
again, sort of came out of nowhere. 
So I say: Say it ain’t so, Joe. I wish 
I had a better story here, but the fact 
of the matter is, this will be done with 
zero consultation with Republicans, 
and what it appears like very little, if 
any, 
consultation 
with 
Democrats. 
Sounds like it was a deal that was cut 
by basically two people, and it is going 
to be shoved through on a party line 
vote, 51 votes here in the U.S. Senate 
at a time when we have got historic 
issues related to our economy which 
are impacting American families in a 
very direct and real way, starting with 
the fact that they are now putting 
more of their purchases on their credit 
cards, they are dipping into retirement 
savings to be able to keep up with just 
the daily cost of living. 
We have already put—I say ‘‘we,’’ not 
we, but if you think about it, in some 
ways, the policies that went through 
here last year, the 1.9 trillion-dollar, 
party line spending bill, led to a lot of 
this inflation. 
So the American people right now, 
average family, according to the Joint 
Economic Committee, which is a bipar-
tisan committee here in the Senate, 
says that it is costing the average fam-
ily in this country $9,000 more this year 
than it did last year for the same basic 
necessities, for the same basket of 
goods. So they have already seen a 
$9,000 tax, and now they are being told 
that there is going to be a big tax in-
crease. Oh, yes, it is going to hit cor-
porations, but don’t think for a minute 
that those costs don’t get passed on in 
the form of higher costs to consumers 
and lower wages to employees, because 
these things don’t happen in a vacuum. 
There are decisions, and there are ef-
fects that happen as a result of those 
decisions. 
I hope my Democrat colleagues will 
think better of this. I can’t think, hon-
estly, of a time where there hasn’t been 
a worse prescription for what ails our 
economy and ails our country than 
what is being proposed here in the form 
of more taxes, more spending, more 
government control, and more pain and 
economic hardship for the American 
people. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Delaware.

RECYCLING AND COMPOSTING 
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise, 
along with Senator CAPITO, today to 
say a few words on behalf of S. 3742, Re-
cycling Infrastructure and Accessi-
bility Act of 2022, and S. 3743, the Recy-
cling Composting Accountability Act. 
Senator CAPITO and I have the pleas-
ure of leading the Senate Environment 
and Public Works Committee. With the 
legislation that we are about to discuss 
here, along with Senator BOOZMAN— 
Senator BOOZMAN is on his way. We are 
all a part of the Recycling Caucus in 
the U.S. Senate. We work with our

July 28, 2022 
staffs and others outside of this body in 
order to make possible this legislation, 
to debate it, to report it. And if I am 
not mistaken, Senator CAPITO reported 
it unanimously out of our committee, 
as we do with so much legislation. 
These bills were introduced by Sen-
ator CAPITO and myself and Senator 
BOOZMAN. As an avid recycler and 
composter, for a long time I have long 
believed in environmental stewardship. 
After all, we have a moral duty to 
leave behind a cleaner, healthier planet 
for our children. 
Senator CAPITO and I are both born in 
West Virginia. My sister and I grew up 
along Beaver Creek, right outside of 
Beckley. My dad used to take me and 
my grandfather fishing and hunting, 
even at a young age, along the New 
River and other parts of Raleigh Coun-
ty. One of the things that my dad and 
my grandfather always made clear to 
me was that if we are out in a boat and 
there was trash or something in the 
water or there was something that 
could be recycled, to pull it out of the 
water and to put it in something we 
were carrying and take it home. The 
idea was to try to leave our State— 
West Virginia then—better, better than 
we found it. So from a very early age in 
West Virginia, I really had those values 
instilled in me. And they still are. We 
instilled them in our sons too. 
But we have a moral obligation to 
leave behind a cleaner, healthier planet 
for our children. There are many ways 
to meet that moral obligation. One of 
those is to make sure that the products 
that can be recycled, we recycle them. 
We don’t have to landfill them. We can 
actually address the climate change in 
a very positive way but especially with 
respect to aluminum cans and things 
like that that we recycle. 
I wish I could stand here today to say 
our recycling rate in Delaware is 100 
percent, West Virginia is 100 percent, 
or the country is 100 percent; it is not. 
The recycling rate in our country is 
something like 35 percent. It is like 
getting a grade in school. If you get a 
35 on a paper or test, that is a failing 
grade. With respect to recycling, unfor-
tunately, we are racking up failing 
grades year after year after year, and 
we ought to do something about it. As 
it turns out, we can. Part of that doing 
something about it is the legislation 
before us today. 
We have to do more when it comes to 
improving our Nation’s recycling and 
our composting efforts. These bills 
would take action to address several of 
the challenges facing America’s recy-
cling efforts. 
One of the challenges that we face is 
the availability of good data. That 
might sound strange, but it is true. 
This past November, for example, the 
Environmental 
Protection 
Agency, 
though, released its first-ever National 
Recycling Strategy. Now, that is kind 
of late to the game, but it is better to 
be late to the game than not to be 
there at all. It turns out it is a good 
document. It is a document that re-
flects input that we provided, our staffs 
provided, others on our committee, and 
across the country provided. And to 
the EPA’s credit, they accepted that 
input, and they actually did something 
with it. So it is reflected in the Na-
tional Recycling Strategy that was 
promulgated. 
The 
document 
offers 
a 
trans-
formative vision for shrinking our Na-
tion’s waste management efforts, and 
it also highlights the need for greater 
standardization around data collection. 
To address this, Senator BOOZMAN 
and I developed the Recycling and 
Composting Accountability Act. Sen-
ator BOOZMAN, myself, Senator CAPITO, 
and others are part of the Recycling 
Caucus here in the Senate, a bipartisan 
group that focuses on how do we pro-
mote and encourage recycling, not just 
on Capitol Hill, not just in the District 
of Columbia, not just on the east coast, 
not just in West Virginia but across 
the country from coast to coast. 
Our legislation, the Recycling and 
Composting Accountability Act, would 
improve EPA’s ability to gather data 
on our Nation’s recycling systems and 
explore opportunities for implementing 
a national composting strategy. 
Another area where we can improve 
is by increasing access to recycling. 
Many 
Americans 
in 
disadvantaged 
communities want to recycle, they 
want to compost, but they are unable 
to do so. That is because they live in 
neighborhoods that lack curbside pick-
up, bottle return, and other necessary 
recycling infrastructure. 
Senator CAPITO’s Recycling Infra-
structure and Accessibility Act would 
help address this by creating a pilot 
program at EPA to improve recycling 
services in underserved areas. This leg-
islation would bring many commu-
nities into the recycling world, includ-
ing those in urban and suburban areas, 
while also protecting our environment. 
I commend Senator CAPITO for her 
work and her leadership on this bill. I 
want to commend her staff and my 
staff, led by Mary Frances Repko, who 
is our staff director, and Adam on the 
other side of the aisle. Members don’t 
do this by themselves, as we know, and 
we are really blessed with terrific staff 
who help us put these provisions to-
gether. 
I commend Senator CAPITO heartily 
for her work and her leadership on this 
legislation, her support of the legisla-
tion Senator BOOZMAN and I have of-
fered. 
I want to work with her to make sure 
that this bill helps jump-start recy-
cling in communities with the greatest 
need, especially those who have been 
historically left behind, and there are 
too many of those. 
Both of these bills that we will have 
an opportunity to consider here today 
are the result of a true collaboration 
and reflect a substantial amount of bi-
partisan efforts dedicated to explore 
our Nation’s recycling and composting 
challenges. 
I know a lot of people, if you watch 
the news, whether it is the television 
or on the radio, newspapers, you read 
online, they think all we do here is 
fight with one another; that we never 
find anything like common ground on 
important issues like the one we are 
talking about right now. The com-
mittee that Senator CAPITO and I are 
privileged to lead actually reports out 
important legislation, including bipar-
tisan infrastructure legislation, all 
kinds of issues that enjoy bipartisan 
support, unanimous bipartisan support. 
S. 3743 
Mr. CARPER. So with that, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 358, S. 3743. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3743) to require the Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency to carry out certain activities to im-
prove recycling and composting programs in 
the United States, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Environment and Public Works, 
with an amendment to strike all after 
the enacting clause and insert in lieu 
thereof the following:

Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the committee-reported sub-
stitute amendment be considered and 
agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be 
considered read a third time and 
passed; and that the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The committee-reported amendment 
in the nature of a substitute was 
agreed to. 
The bill (S. 3743), as amended, was or-
dered to be engrossed for a third read-
ing, was read the third time, and 
passed. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
f 
RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE 
AND ACCESSIBILITY ACT OF 2022 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I feel 
like the Senator from West Virginia 
right now. 
I am very glad that we are going to 
be passing these two recycling bills. 
I will just briefly say I am the co-
sponsor of the bipartisan Recycling and 
Infrastructure 
Accessibility 
Act. 
Sometimes the simplest things that we 
can do have such great impacts, and I 
think that is what we are going to see 
here today. 
In rural America, we don’t have the 
accessibility to recycling and the infra-
structure that we need, and that is the 
point of my bill. It helps us, obviously, 
protect 
our 
environment, 
supports 
jobs, and it helps our municipalities 
and others be able to sustain these. 
This is a pilot program that would 
give Federal support for recycling in-
frastructure projects, such as transfer 
stations and dropoff facilities. That is 
the difficulty; you can’t have one in 
every small town. You need to have a 
spoke-and-hub sort of system, and that 
is what this is looking at. 
I will speed it up here. I want to 
thank all the different organizations 
and groups that have helped: The Na-
tional Water Resources Association, 
the Plastics Industry Association, the 
American Beverage Association, our 
associated staffs, and particularly the 
chair of the full committee. He has 
been just a champion here in working 
on the recycling bills. He is the main 
sponsor of the Recycling Composting 
Accountability Act, of which I am also 
a cosponsor. 
These will fill great and important 
data gaps. These are recycling bills 
that were reported out by voice votes 
so we have unanimous consent by our 
committee. I am glad that our col-
leagues have agreed to pass them. 
S. 3742 
So I will move on and say, as if in 
legislative session, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar 
No. 357, S. 3742. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The clerk will report the bill 
by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 3742) to establish a pilot grant 
program to improve recycling accessibility, 
and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mrs. CAPITO. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 3742) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed as follows: 
S. 3742 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

(e) CONSIDERATIONS.—In selecting eligible 
entities to receive a grant under the pilot 
grant program, the Administrator shall con-
sider— 
(1) whether the community or commu-
nities in which the eligible entity is seeking 
to carry out a proposed project has curbside 
recycling; 
(2) whether the proposed project of the eli-
gible entity will improve accessibility to re-
cycling services in a single underserved com-
munity or multiple underserved commu-
nities; and 
(3) if the eligible entity is a public-private 
partnership, the financial health of the pri-
vate entity seeking to enter into that public- 
private partnership. 
(f) PRIORITY.—In selecting eligible entities

gram, the Administrator shall give priority 
to eligible entities seeking to carry out a 
proposed project in a community in which 
there is not more than 1 materials recovery 
facility within a 75-mile radius of that com-
munity. 
(g) USE
OF
FUNDS.—An eligible entity 
awarded a grant under the pilot grant pro-
gram may use the grant funds for projects to 
improve recycling accessibility in commu-
nities, including in underserved commu-
nities, by— 
(1) increasing the number of transfer sta-
tions; 
(2) expanding curbside recycling collection 
programs where appropriate; and 
(3) leveraging public-private partnerships 
to reduce the costs associated with col-
lecting and transporting recyclable mate-

Mrs. CAPITO. Thank you. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
that Senator BOOZMAN, who is a char-
ter member of the Senate Recycling 
Caucus, be recognized to speak on be-
half of these measures, which he has 
played a key role on. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Thank you, Mr. 
President, and thank you, Mr. Chair-
man and Ranking Member CAPITO, for 
your leadership in that this area. 
As has been said and should be said 
many times more, we appreciate the 
great work of our staffs in getting this 
done. 
The other thing that is so important 
is the answers to our problems need to 
come from the ground up. Through the 
Recycling Caucus and hearings, and 
the list goes on and on, this is where 
those answers were generated—from 
the people who are out fighting the 
battles. 
We talk a lot about the lack of bipar-
tisanship and things. This is a great ex-
ample of people working together for 
the common good up here. 
It is great for the environment in the 
sense that recycling is not just gath-
ering. We don’t want to have a situa-
tion continuing, like we do now, where 
so much of that that is gathered actu-
ally winds up in the landfill eventually. 
Conservation 
is 
the 
low-hanging 
fruit. You know, it makes all the sense 
in the world to reuse things. It creates 
a situation where we lessen the depend-
ence on landfills, things like that. And 
then, again, in this age of globalization 
and things, we really do need to use the 
resources that we have and then con-
tinue to use the resources as we go for-
ward. 
So we are talking about jobs. We are 
talking about the environment. And, 
for that reason, I very much support 
and appreciate, as I said, the leadership 
of the chairman and the ranking mem-
ber for their great effort in pushing 
this forward. 
And, with that, I yield the floor to 
Senator CARDIN—Mr. Chairman. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I just 
want to say again my thanks to—I 
think I am pretty rabid on recycling, 
but this fellow from Arkansas is right 
there with me. I appreciate very much 
both your leadership and Senator CAP-
ITO’s. 
I think we are going to shift gears 
here. We just passed two very signifi-
cant recycling bills for our country. 
This is something that I am thrilled 
about, and I know Senator CAPITO is as 
well. And we are going to shift gears 
and take some time to consider other 
important legislation: the Water Re-
sources Development Act. 
Senator CARDIN, who chairs the sub-
committee, has jurisdiction on the 
water resources bill. I think he is pre-
pared to speak. 
I think I need to make a unanimous 
consent request before we do that. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
WATER RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2022 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to legislative session and con-
sider H.R. 7776, as provided for under 
the previous order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 7776) to provide for improve-
ments to the rivers and harbors of the United 
States, to provide for the conservation and 
development of water and related resources, 
and for other purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, amendment No. 5140 
is agreed to. 
There will now be up to 1 hour of de-
bate equally divided in the usual form. 
The amendment (No. 5140) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to. 
(The amendment is printed in the 
RECORD of July 20, 2022, under ‘‘Text of 
Amendments.’’) 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, with 
that, I would please yield to the chair-
man of the subcommittee that has ju-
risdiction over the Water Resources 
Development Act, BEN CARDIN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me 
thank Chairman CARPER and Ranking 
Member CAPITO and my counterpart on 
the Subcommittee on Infrastructure, 
Senator CRAMER, for bringing us to this 
moment where we will soon be voting 
on the Water Resources Development 
Act. 
I must tell you, this is an extremely 
important bill that gives the Army 
Corps the authorization they need to 
advance critically important water 
projects in our country. 
Mr. President, this was passed by a 
unanimous vote in the Environment 
and Public Works Committee. Due to 
the leadership of Senator CARPER and 
Senator CAPITO, this bill involves the 
input of all the members of our com-
mittee and—dare I say—all the Mem-
bers of the U.S. Senate. So I want to 
thank them for getting this bill to the 
point where we will be able to vote on 
it this afternoon. 
This bill is truly bipartisan. It incor-
porates the input from every single 
Senator and reflects priorities for our

July 28, 2022 
water resources in States and commu-
nities across the country. It provides 
crucial authority for projects and guid-
ance for the Army Corps of Engineers 
to engineer better solutions to our Na-
tion’s toughest water infrastructure 
supply and quality challenges. 
The work of the Army Corps of Engi-
neers is vital for keeping commerce 
flowing in our waterways, for restoring 
aquatic ecosystems, and for helping 
communities deal with the risks and 
impacts of flooding. 
In my State of Maryland, we have 
challenges in all of these areas, and we 
are partnering with the Army Corps to 
address them. The Port of Baltimore, 
for example, is critical in our national 
supply chains and an economic engine 
for the State of Maryland. 
To enhance the port’s ability to serve 
commerce and provide safe navigation, 
the Army Corps is moving forward with 
a Mid-Chesapeake Bay Island Eco-
system Restoration Project, or Mid- 
Bay, which will put dredged material 
to beneficial use restoring our eco-
systems in the Chesapeake Bay, a 
major win-win for commerce and the 
environment. 
Here 
we 
are 
taking 
dredged materials and using it for envi-
ronmental 
restoration, 
providing 
a 
very popular place to put dredged ma-
terial so we can keep our harbors and 
our channels dredged but we also can 
restore our environment at the same 
time. 
A project the size of Mid-Bay also has 
the opportunity to benefit smaller 
channels along the Chesapeake Bay. In 
Maryland, we have dozens and dozens 
of smaller channels that support eco-
nomic activity, recreational opportuni-
ties, and are an integral part of the 
identity of the small communities they 
serve, but these channels have not re-
ceived the maintenance that they re-
quire. 
I am proud that this year’s WRDA 
bill provides the Corps with new au-
thorization to address these under-
served harbors and channels, directing 
the Corps to take a closer look at them 
according to the significance to their 
community and not just based on the 
total amount of cargo they move. This 
is going to help many of our commu-
nities around America. 
In doing so, this bill adds new per-
spective to the Army Corps’ thinking 
so that the Chesapeake Bay is fully un-
derstood not just as an artery for com-
merce but as a national environmental 
treasure that is home to living water-
fronts that support a variety of com-
munity, economic, and nature-based 
activities. The WRDA reauthorization 
takes an important step in that direc-
tion with its provisions for underserved 
harbors. 
I am also proud that this bill in-
cludes a new statewide authorization 
for the Army Corps to provide assist-
ance to Maryland on environmental in-
frastructure. We very much will take 
advantage of this opportunity. We 
know that we have challenges with the 
Chesapeake Bay, and this environ-
mental study assistance will certainly 
help us in meeting our obligations. 
This authorization will also help 
communities across my State deal with 
the impact of aging infrastructure and 
move forward on the backlog of critical 
repairs and upgrades to water supply, 
wastewater, 
and 
stormwater 
infra-
structure. 
The bill recognizes that because the 
Army Corps work is in high demand 
around the country, the Corps needs to 
be accessible to communities and en-
gage with them directly on the chal-
lenges they face. The Planning Assist-
ance to States Program, which has 
been so important to Maryland, will 
now include a new authority for the 
Corps to conduct this outreach to com-
munities. 
The Army Corps is carrying out its 
important work on navigation, flood 
risk mitigation, ecosystem restoration, 
and 
environmental 
infrastructure 
against the backdrop of a worsening 
climate crisis. 
This reality is forcing us to act with 
new urgency to protect our commu-
nities from multiple hazards that our 
country is already experiencing with 
increased frequency and severity, in-
cluding 
concentrated 
catastrophic 
rainfall events, sea level rise, and the 
associated erosion and flooding that 
these impacts bring. It is also forcing 
us to prioritize the restoration of eco-
systems harmed by climate change 
that can still play a role in building re-
silience. All of that is incorporated in 
this bill, and we will be able to have 
those tools that are available. 
I just want to mention that one ex-
ample is marshlands, which absorb 
tons of carbon dioxide in the United 
States each year. They buffer waves 
and reduce flooding during storms. We 
had a hearing in the Environment and 
Public Works Committee yesterday—it 
was a good hearing—on how we can get 
carbon capture. Well, one of the ways 
we can get carbon capture through nat-
ural causes is to restore wetlands, 
which trap carbon, and this bill will 
allow us to move forward in that direc-
tion. 
Finally, I want to note that, this 
year, the Army Corps’ Baltimore Dis-
trict is celebrating its 175th anniver-
sary. I congratulate the Baltimore Dis-
trict on this important milestone. The 
district has played an instrumental 
role in the history of our Nation and 
the State of Maryland, dating back to 
the construction of Fort McHenry, and 
I am proud of the ongoing partnership 
of Colonel Pinchasin, the current re-
gional director. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I again applaud the great lead-
ership we have on our committee, the 
very open way that we do business, the 
way that we listen to each other and 
are able to get the priorities accom-
plished. 
To Senator CARPER and Senator CAP-
ITO and Senator CRAMER, it is a pleas-
ure to work with you, and thank you 
for making this possible. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I would 
like to thank the Senator from Mary-
land, Mr. CARDIN, for his good, hard 
work with Senator CRAMER on the sub-
committee. Senator CARDIN and I share 
the Chesapeake Bay. He has got a lot 
more of it than I do, but we have 
worked on those issues for years to-
gether, and I think that shows his dedi-
cation not just to his State but to the 
environment. So I appreciate all of his 
efforts. 
I am very pleased to rise today in 
strong support of the bipartisan Water 
Resources Development Act of 2022. 
This is the bill we are considering 
today. We call it WRDA. Most of us 
know it as WRDA. 
Congress authorizes water resource 
projects and sets national policies for 
the Civil Works Program and for the 
U.S. Corps of Engineers. The work of 
the 
Corps 
facilitates 
commerce 
throughout the country and inter-
nationally. Projects along our inland 
waterways, which are important in my 
State, and in our ports enable the 
movement of cargo while also bol-
stering our supply chain. Their support 
and partnership during this process 
were integral for us to reach a solid 
agreement. 
So, Mr. Chair, I would like to thank 
you and your staff, and I am going to 
go through our staff list really quickly: 
Mary Frances Repko, John Kane, Jor-
dan 
Baugh, 
Mayely 
Boyce, 
Tyler 
Hofmann-Reardon, Milo Goodell, and 
Janine Barr from your staff. 
So thank you all very, very much. 
Today proves, again, the ability of 
our EPW Committee to develop bipar-
tisan infrastructure legislation that 
addresses the needs of Senators in the 
communities that we represent. Our 
colleagues submitted more than 800 
policy and project priorities to the 
committee. 
We 
worked 
hard 
to 
thoughtfully incorporate a majority of 
their requests into this legislation, and 
I think that shows with the vote we got 
in committee. 
True to the Corps’ tradition, the bill 
moves forward projects that benefit 
local communities and the entire coun-
try. 
We know that natural disasters such 
as floods and hurricanes can strike at 
any time and have devastating con-
sequences for our communities. The 
Corps’ work to protect the lives and 
livelihoods of millions of Americans is 
furthered by congressional authoriza-
tion of flood and coastal storm risk 
management projects. 
Since 2014, Congress has enacted 
WRDA every 2 years, and I am thrilled 
that we are here again continuing that 
tradition. I again want to thank Chair-
man CARPER
for his leadership and 
dedication to this critical piece of leg-
islation, as well as—and I think I al-
ready mentioned them, but I will men-
tion 
them 
again 
because 
Senator 
CARDIN and Senator CRAMER have been

very integral as the subcommittee 
chairs. 
Specifically, the WRDA bill author-
izes 30 projects around the country, in-
cluding projects for navigation, flood 
and coastal storm risk management, 
and ecosystem restoration. One such 
project is a coastal storm risk manage-
ment project along the eastern coast of 
Texas. Think of all of the hurricanes 
and damage that we have heard over 
the years that have come in on the 
eastern shore at Galveston and Hous-
ton. This will help mitigate the im-
pacts of future hurricanes and ensure 
that critical port assets can continue 
to serve our country’s shipping and 
supply chain needs as we are moving 
forward. 
The bill also directs the Corps to ex-
pedite the completion of 24 previously 
authorized projects, and it authorizes 
36 studies that will develop solutions to 
water resources challenges that we 
have ahead. 
While this bill is very much oriented 
toward advancing critical projects and 
studies in our States, it also includes 
several policy changes that I would 
like to highlight. At the beginning of 
this process, I outlined areas in which 
I believe changes would be beneficial. I 
said we needed to reduce the confusion 
that 
some 
communities 
experience 
when they are dealing with the Corps 
and ensure more effective delivery of 
our projects—and efficient delivery. So 
the bill bolsters the Agency’s technical 
assistance authorities, specifically the 
Floodplain Management Services and 
Planning Assistance to States Pro-
gram—again, one that impacts my 
State greatly. 
This bill authorizes the Corps to con-
duct outreach to ensure that our com-
munities are knowledgeable of the 
ways in which the Agency can help 
them with their water resources needs. 
It directs the Corps to designate staff 
in each district that can do this out-
reach. 
The bill makes important improve-
ments to the Tribal Partnership Pro-
gram and other authorities to assist 
Indian Tribes. It also expands existing 
programs and includes new authorities 
to assist communities that are eco-
nomically 
disadvantaged, 
including 
those located in rural areas. 
It requires reporting on timelines for 
the environmental review process for 
projects. The bill directs the GAO to 
conduct a study: a review of projects 
that are overbudgeted and delayed— 
find out what is going on—as well as a 
review of the Corps’ mitigation prac-
tices for projects. 
The bill includes several provisions 
that improve flexibility with regard to 
financial accounting; for example, the 
bill allows Federal Agencies to provide 
funding to help satisfy the non-Federal 
sponsor’s contribution for a project or 
study under certain circumstances. It 
authorizes, for the first time, a dedi-
cated research and development ac-
count for the Corps to spur innovation 
and provides contracting flexibility in 
undertaking these activities. 
The bill directs the Corps to support 
science, technology, engineering, and 
math—STEM—education and recruit 
individuals for careers at this Agency. 
The input of non-Federal entities is 
crucial to successfully resolving water 
resources challenges now and in the fu-
ture. 
This bill establishes a new advisory 
committee for non-Federal interests to 
voice their opinions on how the Corps 
can better meet their needs. 
We preserve the integral part of the 
non-Federal cost share partners in the 
project delivery process by avoiding 
mandates from Washington, DC, and 
ensuring that the Corps continues to 
evaluate a full array of solutions dur-
ing the feasibility study phase. 
In addition to my role as a ranking 
member, I represent the great State of 
West Virginia, and I worked to address 
the needs of my home State. Here are 
just a few highlights before I close. 
This legislation advances a critical 
flood control project of the city of Mil-
ton, WV. Authorized in the 1990s, this 
project is longtime coming, and I am 
proud to have helped move it forward. 
The bill also supports flood control 
studies for the Kanawha River Basin 
and the city of Huntington. And it con-
tinues to provide environmental infra-
structure assistance to communities 
throughout the State. 
Finally, the bill will provide addi-
tional critical support to riverbank 
stabilizations such as those on the 
Kanawha River. 
In closing, there is a lot in this bill— 
I could go on and on, but I won’t—for 
communities across the country. It is 
the culmination of a true bipartisan 
agreement and represents our shared 
goal of addressing the Nation’s water 
resources needs. 
I am very proud of our committee. I 
am very proud to be here today with 
you. We are active; we are cooperative; 
and we are fruitful. We get things done. 
I like that. It is a testament to the val-
ues and goals that Chairman CARPER 
and I share, and it is a testament to 
our personal friendship and our work-
ing relationship. Thank you for that. 
Before I close, I would like to thank 
my staff as well for all of their hard 
work and dedication to seeing that we 
get this across the finish line: Adam 
Tomlinson, 
Murphie 
Barrett, 
Max 
Hyman, 
Kim 
Townsend, 
Katherine 
Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, and Haden 
Miller. 
I would also like to thank the tech-
nical assistance that we received from 
the U.S. Corps of Engineers staff: Amy 
Klein, Dave Wethington, and countless 
other technical staff. 
And, then, from Senate legislative 
counsel, 
we 
would 
like 
to 
thank 
Deanna Edwards. 
I look forward to a rousing vote here 
in a few minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I could 
not improve upon what has already 
been said about the work on this im-
portant bill. Senator CAPITO has ar-
ticulated much more eloquently than I 
all of the priorities that are important 
in the bill. 
I am just going to add my thanks to 
Chairman CARPER
and to Ranking 
Member CAPITO and, of course, to sub-
committee Chairman CARDIN as well. It 
has been a great team effort, as is, I 
think, illustrated in the final product 
and the overwhelming vote. Let’s keep 
the team together. And let’s just pass a 
really big, important WRDA bill. 
And I emphasize again, we did this 
through regular order, colleagues. We 
stayed on the 2-year schedule, col-
leagues. And when we work together, 
we can do good work for the people we 
serve. 
With that, I urge a strong vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I want 
to thank Senator CRAMER not just for 
his words but—I will take my mask 
off—not just for his words but for his 
great participation, he and his staff, in 
this effort. 
I don’t think it has been said in our 
short time we have been on the floor 
here 
this 
morning: 
In 
the 
sub-
committee, we don’t just make up this 
legislation. We have a tradition of 
reaching out to other Senate offices. 
We reached out to all 100 Senate of-
fices. We ask everybody—Democrat, 
Republican, a couple of Independents— 
and say: What are your priorities? 
What would you like to see prioritized, 
included in this legislation? 
We received feedback and input from, 
I think, every single office. And we 
have tried to reflect that input in this 
legislation. 
So this is very much a community ef-
fort. And for everyone who has partici-
pated, thank you for doing so and put-
ting us in a position today to vote and, 
hopefully, in an affirmative way. 
Before we do vote, I just want to ex-
press one more time my very, very 
strong support for the Water Resources 
Development Act of 2022. As we have 
heard before this bill: Affectionately 
known as WRDA, it is an ambitious, bi-
partisan water resources package that 
ensures the timely reauthorization of 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer stud-
ies and projects. The bill also equips 
the Corps with critical authorities to 
restore ecosystems and protect com-
munities from climate-change-exacer-
bated events like flooding and drought. 
This legislation is a product of tire-
less commitment to bipartisanship and 
doing the right thing. Senator CAPITO, 
Senator CARDIN, Senator CRAMER, and 
myself and our staffs look past the 
party differences and find, once more, a 
path forward on critical infrastructure 
needs, just as we did last year on the 
bipartisan infrastructure bill that the 
President signed into law late last 
year. 
This is not the first time we have 
done this, and it won’t be the last. This 
Congress, the Environmental Public 
Works Committee, has consistently ad-
vanced bipartisan legislation on drink-
ing water; legislation on wastewater;

July 28, 2022 
legislation on transportation—roads, 
highways, bridges—and on recycling 
just today, just today. All of those bills 
passed EPW unanimously, just like 
this Army Corps of Engineers bill 
passed unanimously. 
As EPW chairman, I am quite proud 
of the committee’s work. I just wish 
that everybody in the country who 
thinks that all we do is fight around 
here and agree on nothing—I wish they 
had a chance to kind of tune in and 
maybe be a fly on the wall and hear 
how when you work together, you can 
get some amazing stuff done and really 
important, really important things, as 
well, for all of our States, for every 
corner of this country. 
A word, if I could, about the Army 
Corps of Engineers. I am a Navy guy. I 
spent something like 23 years Active 
Reserve Duty. I am the last Vietnam 
veteran serving here. But I have huge 
respect—huge respect—for the Army 
Corps of Engineers. I like to say: Dif-
ferent uniforms, same team. And in my 
State and, frankly, all 50 States, they 
do 
extraordinary 
work—sometimes 
without a lot of recognition, without a 
lot of thanks. And I just want to say, 
we recognize you in Delaware; we rec-
ognize you even in the Navy; and we 
are deeply grateful for the work that 
you do, the great work you do. We 
couldn’t do a lot of what we do without 
your help. And this legislation is need-
ed for the Army Corps to meet their re-
sponsibilities and obligations. 
But all the bills that I mentioned 
earlier passed committee unanimously, 
as did this bill. And, again, we are so 
proud of the committee’s work. 
What a joy it is to work with Senator 
CAPITO. And I wish I could say the 
same thing about her staff. No. I am 
just joking. 
Adam, you know we love working 
with you and your team, and we are 
really privileged. 
We were privileged to be led on our 
side of the staff by Mary Frances 
Repko, who is new at this. She has not 
worked long for many weeks or months 
on the Hill. Actually, she has probably 
for a quarter of a century or so, and I 
think she started at the age of 12. She 
has done a lot, and she still has a lot of 
gas in the tank. 
But going back to the Corps—the 
Corps is the principal steward of our 
Nation’s water infrastructure, and it 
serves both as a facilitator and pro-
tector of our diverse economy. 
This 
bill—WRDA 
2022—recognizes 
that the Corps is an essential part of 
our lives. This bill takes critical steps 
to better support the Agency as it 
serves all parts of our country. From 
navigation to ecosystem restoration 
and flood control, the Corps is the 
backbone—really, the foundation, if 
you will, on which our country was 
built. 
I would like to reiterate that every 
provision in this bill is the result of bi-
partisan work. I can confidently say 
that WRDA 2022 will benefit all corners 
of our nation—from Alaska to Cali-
fornia to Kentucky to New York, from 
Maryland to rural towns and every 
place in between. 
Again, I want to express my heartfelt 
thanks to staff on the Democratic side, 
the majority staff, and to Senator CAP-
ITO’s staff on the minority side, the Re-
publican side. 
Actually, you can walk into a meet-
ing, some of the meetings we have with 
Senator CAPITO
and myself and our 
staffs, and if you didn’t know who 
worked for whom, you wouldn’t know. 
You wouldn’t know, which I think is an 
amazing thing, a wonderful thing. 
With that in mind, again, I want to 
thank again my staff and Senate CAP-
ITO’s staff who worked so hard. I want 
to recognize, again, Mary Frances 
Repko and Adam Tomlinson for their 
dedicated leadership on the Democratic 
side and the Republican side of our 
committee. 
I also want to thank Murphie Bar-
rett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend, 
Katherine Scarlett, Jacob Mitchell, 
Haden Miller, Mayely Boyce, Tyler 
Hofmann Reardon, Jordan Baugh, Milo 
Goodell, Janine Barr, and John Kane— 
especially John Kane—for their tireless 
efforts. 
John, you are a force of nature. And 
thank you very, very much for your 
great leadership. 
I would like to say, again—I just said 
that, so I am not going to say that 
again. I also want to thank Amy Klein 
and David Wethington of the Corps— 
Amy Klein and David Wethington of 
the Corps—for their countless hours of 
technical assistance and support as the 
bill was developed. 
In closing, I want to encourage all of 
our colleagues to join us in supporting 
this excellent bill, because every State 
stands to benefit from the legislation 
before us today. 
Mr. President, the Senate is now con-
sidering the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act of 2022, affectionately known 
as WRDA. Not only is this biennial leg-
islation an ambitious water resources 
bill, it is also the product of a tireless 
commitment to bipartisanship. Earlier 
this year, we reached out to all 100 
Senators to solicit their input for this 
legislation. We developed this legisla-
tion using that feedback, and in May, 
we advanced this legislation out of the 
Environment and Public Works Com-
mittee by a vote of 20 to 0, something 
I am quite proud of as EPW chairman. 
In these times of partisan divide, it is 
not often we see legislation receive 
unanimous support. But, as we all 
know, bipartisan solutions are lasting 
solutions. That is how I think we 
should approach much of our work in 
the Senate—by reaching across the 
aisle to find lasting solutions, where 
possible, to the problems we face as a 
nation. The bill before us today is a re-
sult of that partnership. 
Before I delve into all we accomplish 
in this bill, let me thank everyone who 
played a role in its development—espe-
cially our EPW committee ranking 
member, Senator CAPITO, our Trans-
portation 
and 
Infrastructure 
Sub-
committee chair, Senator CARDIN, our 
subcommittee ranking member, Sen-
ator CRAMER, every member of our 
committee, and the members of our 
staffs. I also want to thank the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers for sup-
porting us throughout the drafting 
process. 
This legislation continues the 2-year 
cycle for WRDA. By passing it, we will 
ensure timely authorization of the 
Army Corps’ studies and projects. This 
work is critical in supporting our econ-
omy, restoring critical ecosystems, and 
protecting communities from climate 
change and extreme weather events 
like flooding and drought. 
When we talk about WRDA, I cannot 
overstate just how important the Army 
Corps’ work is in the lives of Ameri-
cans across the country. The Corps is 
the principal steward of our Nation’s 
water infrastructure. That includes our 
beaches, our waterways, and our flood 
control systems. Without the enact-
ment of WRDA, our economy could 
well grind to a halt. 
The Corps operates and maintains 
America’s water highway, a 12,000- 
mile-long system of inland waterways 
with 209 locks that are vital to domes-
tic and international commerce. Each 
year, more than 500 million tons of 
commodities move through this sys-
tem, including 60 percent of our Na-
tion’s agricultural exports. Operating 
and maintaining this extensive net-
work results in an economic benefit of 
nearly $14 billion each year for our 
country. 
In addition to managing the water-
ways that connect our ports to world 
commerce, the Army Corps of Engi-
neers is also responsible for ensuring 
safe, reliable, and efficient navigation 
at our coastal ports. As we have seen 
over the past 2 years, navigable ship-
ping channels are essential to keeping 
global supply chains moving. 
More than 99 percent of U.S. overseas 
trade volume moves through the 13,000 
miles of coastal channels maintained 
by the Corps, supporting over 30 mil-
lion jobs across the country. Cargo ac-
tivity at our Nation’s ports supports 
more than a quarter of the U.S. econ-
omy. And, over the next decade, an es-
timated $66 billion in future invest-
ment will be needed to ensure contin-
ued domestic job creation and eco-
nomic growth. 
Recognizing the economic impor-
tance of our Nation’s inland shipping 
channels, WRDA 2022 adjusts the In-
land Waterways Trust Fund cost share 
to expedite much needed project im-
provements. 
The legislation also addresses the 
harbor 
deepening 
and 
maintenance 
needs 
of 
commercially 
significant 
ports, as well as underserved commu-
nity harbors. While commercially sig-
nificant ports are vital to our Nation’s 
economy, community harbors are simi-
larly important to local and regional 
economies.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3760 
July 28, 2022 
WRDA 2022 ensures that these com-
munity harbors, which provide essen-
tial fishing, recreation, and navigation 
services, will continue to receive main-
tenance that will allow for their con-
tinued use. 
As a recovering Governor, I often 
like to say that it is our responsibility 
as elected officials to create a nur-
turing environment for job creation 
and job preservation. Maintaining our 
ports and coastal waterways is a cor-
nerstone of that nurturing environ-
ment. 
The Corps is also a leader in flood 
and storm damage mitigation and eco-
system restoration. In addition to 
managing over 700 dams and more than 
13,000 miles of levees and floodwalls, it 
restores and nourishes the Nation’s 
dunes and beaches, constructs and 
maintains wetlands and floodplains, 
and protects shorelines and riverbanks. 
In total, the Corps’ flood and coastal 
storm risk management activities, and 
infrastructure portfolio, provide the 
nation an economic benefit of nearly 
$260 billion in damage prevention and 
reduction. This is critical to under-
stand because more than 40 percent of 
our Nation’s population lives in coastal 
counties. If coastal counties were their 
own nation, they would rank third in 
the world in gross domestic product— 
beaten out only by China and the 
United States as a whole. 
This work is especially important for 
the communities I represent in Dela-
ware. Earlier this year, on the Satur-
day before Mother’s Day, a nor’easter 
pummeled beaches up and down the 
Delmarva Peninsula. When I toured the 
damage, it was staggering to think 
that in 2 weeks, these communities 
needed to be ready for the first real 
beach season since the start of the 
COVID pandemic. 
While many beaches had experienced 
severe erosion and destruction, the 
dune system that the Corps had built 
worked as designed and protected Del-
marva communities from the storm. 
Homes and buildings remained intact. 
Businesses could still operate. States 
were prepared to handle the storm be-
cause of the work that the Army Corps 
had done. Now, we are working with 
the Corps to rebuild these beaches, 
which are the lifeblood of our States’ 
economies. 
Water, as we all know, is essential 
for life and a critical input into vir-
tually all economic activity. It is 
hard—in fact, it is impossible—to have 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness, without the use of water and 
water-related infrastructure. Unfortu-
nately, climate change is fueling ex-
treme weather in the form of longer 
and stronger noreasters, hurricanes, 
and droughts. This threatens the Corps’ 
ability to be a good steward of our 
water infrastructure, as well as that 
infrastructure’s ability to protect and 
support our economy. 
And this is not just a problem for 
coastal communities. For inland com-
munities like those along the Missouri 
River, climate change means heavier 
and 
more 
frequent 
precipitation 
events, inland flooding, riverbank ero-
sion, and the inundation of water 
treatment systems with sediments and 
contaminants in some areas. For other 
communities out west, climate change 
means historic droughts, water short-
ages, and deeply destructive wildfires. 
The Water Resources Development 
Act of 2022 recognizes these challenges 
posed by climate change. It accounts 
for the new realities that the Corps 
faces in carrying out its primary mis-
sions and takes critical steps to ad-
dress these looming concerns. How? 
First, 
WRDA 
2022 
overhauls 
the 
Corps’ project development authorities, 
allowing the agency to better address 
the impacts of climate change. This 
will make a big difference in States 
like Arizona, where we are witnessing 
the worst drought conditions along the 
Colorado River in 12,000 years. 
Under our legislation, the Corps and 
local project sponsors will, for the first 
time, be able to partner and develop 
cost-shared plans to address drought 
risk management and water supply 
conservation during the planning, con-
structing, and operating of water re-
sources development projects. 
Communities in coastal States will 
also be able to develop projects that 
address their specific climate-related 
impacts. This means that we will see 
projects better formulated to combat 
sea level rise, as well as back bay 
flooding or even sunny day tidal 
changes instead of just storm surge 
protection. 
In addition to overhauling the Corps’ 
project 
development 
authorities, 
WRDA 2022 makes clear that the pro-
tection and restoration of shorelines 
and riverbanks from erosion and other 
damaging forces is a primary responsi-
bility. It also improves the Corps’ abil-
ity to make shorelines and riverbanks 
more resilient. 
In crafting this legislation, we also 
made equity a top priority. I am 
pleased to report that WRDA 2022 
builds on the significant inroads made 
in WRDA 2020 to rectify historical in-
equities for Tribal and disadvantaged 
communities. 
WRDA 2022 establishes a new Tribal 
and Disadvantaged Communities Advi-
sory Committee to help the Corps more 
effectively deliver projects, programs, 
and other assistance to these commu-
nities. It also makes permanent the 
2020 pilot programs that cover cost 
shares for economically disadvantaged 
communities. 
In addition, this legislation reauthor-
izes the Corps’ Tribal Partnership Pro-
gram and makes a series of targeted 
improvements to increase opportuni-
ties for Tribal communities to partner 
with the Corps on essential projects in 
a more cost-effective way. 
Finally, WRDA 2022 establishes a new 
workforce development and STEM out-
reach program at the Corps with a pri-
ority to recruit new engineers from 
historically 
disadvantaged 
commu-
nities. 
As we move to the consideration of 
the Water Resources Development Act 
of 2022, I am reminded of an old African 
proverb that goes something like this: 
‘‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you 
want to go far, travel together.’’ On 
this bill, we can proudly say that we 
have chosen to travel together. 
With that in mind, I would like to 
take a moment to thank my staff and 
Ranking Member CAPITO’S staff who 
together spent tireless hours drafting 
and negotiating each provision in this 
bill. 
I would like to recognize our staff di-
rectors, 
Mary 
Frances 
Repko 
and 
Adam Tomlinson, for their dedicated 
leadership. 
I would also like to thank Murphie 
Barrett, Max Hyman, Kim Townsend,

PACT ACT 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
coming down to the floor to speak 
briefly on our efforts to protect wom-
en’s access to birth control and contra-
ception, but before I do, I just want to 
note something that happened here 
today that was really odd. 
So a few weeks back, we came to-
gether and had a consensus bipartisan 
vote to stand up for our veterans. A 
number of Republican and Democratic 
legislators here in the House and the 
Senate worked together to develop 
something called the PACT Act. 
This is groundbreaking legislation, 
decades in the making, that provides 
veterans access to healthcare for expo-
sure to toxic chemicals, exposure that 
comes through being subjected to mili-
tary burn pits—these are pits where a 
lot of toxic chemicals and plastics are 
burned at military installations—but 
also for exposure to chemicals like 
Agent Orange. 
So we had an 84-to-14 vote here just a 
few weeks ago in favor of the PACT 
Act and then the bill came back to the 
Senate due to some technical correc-
tions having nothing to do with the 
substance of the bill. And yesterday 
the vote went from 84 to 55. Thirty 
Senators reversed their vote, and the 
bill failed. All 30 of those were Repub-
licans. 
What happened in 2 weeks that con-
vinced 30 Republicans, who previously 
thought it was a good idea to help vet-
erans, to decide instead to tank a bill 
that was helping veterans? 
There are really only two expla-
nations. 
The more charitable explanation is 
that 30 Republicans just changed their 
minds; that 3 weeks ago they thought 
it was a good bill, helping veterans was 
a good idea, and 3 weeks later they de-
cided that it wasn’t a good idea; that 
they would rather spend that money on 
somebody else instead of our most vul-
nerable veterans. 
Now, that would be pretty fantastic 
to have 30 Members of the Senate 
change their minds on the merits of a 
bill, especially a bill that helps vet-
erans, the most vulnerable veterans in 
this country, veterans who are dealing 
with cancer and respiratory illnesses. 
The less charitable explanation is 
this. Republicans are mad that Demo-
crats are on the verge of passing cli-
mate change legislation and have de-
cided to take out their anger on vul-
nerable veterans because that is the 
other thing that has changed in the 
last 3 weeks. Republicans thought that 
Democrats weren’t going to be able to 
pass a bill asking corporations to pay a 
little 
bit 
more, 
tackling 
climate 
change. Yesterday, news emerged that 
there is an agreement that makes it 
likely that a climate change bill is 
going to proceed on the Senate floor, 
and, magically, 30 votes flipped. 
That is the less charitable expla-
nation because that would be pretty 
horrific if Republicans were mad about 
a climate change bill and decided to 
take out their anger on veterans—on 
vulnerable veterans. 
So maybe in the coming days we will 
figure out which one it was. Maybe we 
will figure out if 30 votes flipped be-
cause the merits of the bill dictated 
that flip or maybe we will find out that 
Republicans have decided to just take 
out their anger about the reconcili-
ation bill on veterans. Either way, this 
is not a good day for veterans in this 
country. 
Democrats are standing up for vet-
erans. We are going to keep voting for 
the PACT Act. We are going to bring it 
back. But 30 Republicans who thought 
helping veterans was a good idea just 3 
weeks ago all of a sudden abandoned 
the cause. 
WOMEN’S HEALTHCARE 
Mr. President, I came down to the 
floor to talk about something that hap-
pened yesterday as well. That was an 
effort by Democrats to get a bill on the 
floor that would protect women’s ac-
cess to contraception, and Republicans, 
predictably, blocked that bill from re-
ceiving consideration. I want to talk 
about the broader picture of what is 
going on here today. 
J.D. Vance is a candidate for the U.S. 
Senate. He is a Republican star, maybe 
the party’s highest profile candidate 
running for the Senate. Here is what he 
said about men who beat up their 
wives. He said: ‘‘[O]ne of the great 
tricks that I think the sexual revolu-
tion pulled on the American populace’’ 
was convincing people in ‘‘unhappy’’ or 
‘‘violent’’ marriages that getting di-
vorced would ‘‘make [them] happier.’’ 
Women should stop complaining, he 
suggests, about getting the crap beat 
out of them, stop trying to leave abu-
sive husbands and just stick it out. 
Senator HAWLEY, a few months ago, 
gave a whole speech explaining how 
men have certain virtues critical to the 
maintenance of the American Republic 
like aggression and competitiveness 
and independence that women don’t 
have in equal measure. He made a pret-
ty unapologetic case for the superi-
ority of men over women. 
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, who is the 
biggest draw in the Republican Party 
right now—nobody gets a bigger crowd 
than she does. She says that women 
should just accept that they are the 
‘‘weaker sex.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3762 
July 28, 2022 
A few weeks ago, on this floor, Re-
publicans refused to allow a debate on 
a bill that simply said government 
can’t tell women which States they can 
travel to in order to receive healthcare. 
And yesterday, Republicans blocked 
proceeding to a bill that simply says 
that men shouldn’t be able to stop 
women from buying birth control. 
So put that all together. Do you see 
the pattern emerging here? Do you see 
what is going on? This is a pretty co-
ordinated, industrial-scale effort to 
bring women under control of the 
State, to take away decades of rights 
accumulation for women, and put them 
back where they were in the 1940s and 
the 1930s. 
This is a massive, coordinated effort 
by Republicans to put more women 
under government control: no more 
abortion services, no more divorces 
from your abusive spouses, no more 
driving your car wherever you want, no 
more birth control. Women are on their 
way back to becoming second-class 
citizens. That is what the cumulative 
agenda looks like here. 
And I don’t think I am paranoid. I 
don’t think I am overreading the tea 
leaves. I am just picking up the pieces 
that Republicans keep putting down 
day after day after day. 
I know Republicans will dispute this 
characterization, but if they do, we are 
going to continually give them the 
chance to prove us wrong—vote for a 
bill that says States can’t ban birth 
control, vote for legislation that says 
States can’t tell women where they can 
drive. What we are asking for is not an 
expansion of women’s rights, just a 
protection to make sure that we don’t 
take these big leaps backward. 
Other Republicans will say that these 
are imagined crises; that States really 
aren’t going to ban birth control. But 
just pay attention to what is hap-
pening in State legislatures right now 
all over the country. States are trying 
to restrict women from accessing con-
traception because many Republicans 
will tell you that protecting life, in 
their view, involves banning the use of 
birth control. 
In Texas, the State already bans its 
family planning centers from distrib-
uting birth control. In Missouri, con-
servatives 
are 
trying 
to 
block 
healthcare providers who receive Fed-
eral funds from prescribing contracep-
tion. And the Supreme Court in the 
Dobbs decision basically briefed that it 
is likely to strike down the right to 
birth control sometime soon. 
So this isn’t a fake crisis; this is real. 
And I am not making up this new 
wholesale Republican effort to try to 
drag women back 100 years and to side-
line them in a way that we thought 
was history. That is all real too. And 
we will give Republicans the chance, 
over and over again, to prove that 
wrong. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
PACT ACT 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I want to 
talk just a few minutes about the cir-
cumstances we now find ourselves in, 
in passing what I consider to be one of 
the most important pieces of legisla-
tion—perhaps 
the 
most 
important 
piece of legislation that is currently 
pending certainly before the U.S. Sen-
ate—and that is what we have been re-
ferring to as the PACT Act. 
It is legislation that we have talked 
about many times on the Senate floor. 
It is a piece of legislation that I and 
Senator TESTER
introduced. It is a 
piece of legislation that follows a long 
line of bills coming from the Senate 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Committee 
with 
broad bipartisan support that have 
consequential outcomes for the vet-
erans of our Nation. 
We started years ago, several years 
ago, in regard to the MISSION Act. We 
followed that with the John Scott 
Hannon Act. 
The MISSION Act provided addi-
tional opportunities for veterans to ac-
cess care in settings across the country 
to bring medical care to veterans clos-
er to home to make it more available. 
And we followed that with the John 
Hannon Act, which dealt with mental 
health and trying to reduce and elimi-
nate the use of suicide in veterans’ 
lives. 
And then, finally, we have this major 
piece of legislation that has been a 
long time coming—way too long—in 
meeting the needs of those veterans 
who served, now, a long time ago in 
Vietnam and in Southeast Asia and our 
veterans who more recently served in 
Iraq and Afghanistan. It is the subject 
of toxic exposure, where veterans come 
into 
contact 
with 
something 
that 
maybe not at the time created any 
healthcare concerns for them but over 
time has become a significant medical 
and healthcare challenge for those who 
served in those areas, in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, their location in relation to 
the location of a burn pit—where many 
things were burned and caused toxic 
exposure for those veterans in the vi-
cinity—and going back to Vietnam, 
Agent Orange, which has been so dev-
astating to so many people. 
Veterans have waited for a long time. 
The process to date has been so slow. 
The legislative efforts, while they have 
occurred, were never sufficient to meet 
the needs of those who served our Na-
tion. 
And the actions at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs have delayed deci-
sions for veterans that would make 
certain that those who encountered 
these 
traumatic 
and 
damaging 
healthcare consequences of their serv-
ice to our Nation receive the medical 
care that they deserve and the benefits, 
the financial benefits, that come from 
being disabled as a result of military 
service. 
I want to reiterate my support for 
that piece of legislation. The PACT Act 
needs to—as it came out of our com-
mittee by a unanimous vote. It passed 
the Senate previously with 84 votes. 
And we need to continue the practice 
of taking care of our Nation’s veterans 
in a way that is not partisan on either 
side of the issues. 
I often tell my constituents, with 
some level of pride, that I serve on a 
committee, and, unfortunately, one of 
the 
few 
remaining 
committees 
in 
which it is difficult sometimes to tell 
whether there is a Republican chair-
man or a Democratic chairman. I have 
been a ranking member and the rank-
ing member of that committee and I 
have been the chairman of that com-
mittee. The Senator from Montana and 
I have worked hard. And in many ways, 
because of our veterans, it is a natural 
occurrence 
that 
we 
find 
common 
ground, and our committee members 
have done the same. 
We are now at the point in which we 
need to make certain that the PACT 
Act be considered, that cloture be in-
voked, the difficulties we have had 
with whether there needs to be an 
amendment or amendments need to be 
resolved, and this issue needs to pass 
the U.S. Senate in short order. 
Our veterans need to be reassured. I 
would do this to the best of my ability 
to reassure veterans that, for whatever 
is in my capabilities, I am going to be 
the advocate, the spokesperson, the 
one who is trying to make—along with 
my colleagues. I am not trying to sin-
gle myself out as the only one who 
cares about this issue. But for what I 
can do, I am going to do it to make 
sure that we have success in this legis-
lation. Success, to me, is passage by 
the Senate, passage by the House, and 
signed by the President, and a law that 
then can be implemented by the De-
partment of Veterans Affairs. 
I have said many times that there 
are lots of challenges still to come. No 
piece of legislation that we pass is eas-
ily implemented by the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and we will have our 
work to do. But at the moment, the 
work before us, the work that needs to 
be accomplished today, now, this week, 
is the passage of the PACT Act so that 
our veterans who are encountering sig-
nificant medical challenges have the 
care and benefits that come from being 
a veteran. 
I am one of those who agree with the 
thought, the belief, that if you serve in 
our military, we owe you to live up to 
the promises we made. I am of the be-
lief that the costs of war—they cer-
tainly come with the service. We then 
have an obligation not only to fund the 
military activities but to fund the pro-
grams and benefits that are necessary 
to care for those who serve who, as a 
result of their service, are damaged 
mentally, 
physically, 
socially, 
and 
emotionally. 
Again, I ask the leaders of the U.S. 
Senate and my colleagues here to— 
let’s get this resolved, let’s get it re-
solved quickly, and let’s make certain 
that our veterans, as we want to serve 
them, are served in the way they 
should be.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3763 
July 28, 2022 
I just would only add that time is of 
the essence. This bill has been pending 
before the Senate for a while and, be-
fore that, in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. But it has been a con-
versation by our veterans service orga-
nizations, their members; it has been a 
conversation by veterans organizations 
across the country now for decades: 
Solve this problem. 
We are on the cusp of doing so, and 
we should not let this moment pass. 
There are veterans who are dying every 
day. There are veterans who have died 
since this legislation was introduced. I 
would like to make certain that there 
is no veteran, even if he or she is near-
ing that time of the end of their life, 
worried about whether their children 
or their spouse is going to receive the 
care and treatment and the benefits 
that they earned by their service. 
So, Mr. President, please, my col-
leagues of the U.S. Senate, please, let’s 
make certain we do our work to honor 
their service. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise 
this afternoon to make sure that the 
plight of Russian leader Vladimir Kara- 
Murza is not forgotten, that the out-
rageous 
imprisonment 
of 
Vladimir 
Kara-Murza by the Russian dictator 
Vladimir Putin is not forgotten. 
We remember three decades ago what 
hope we had for a new Russia. Russia 
had entered a new age of possibility 
some three decades ago. After more 
than 70 years of communist repression, 
the Soviet order had collapsed, and 
with it, the Iron Curtain that kept 
freedom away from millions was torn 
down. 
As the red flags came down in Mos-
cow, the free world watched with an-
ticipation, hoping that democracy and 
the rule of law might finally take root 
in a free Russia. Regrettably, that has 
not happened. Instead of democracy 
and freedom, the Russian people got 
Vladimir Putin, a man who has used 
his office to murder, imprison, and 
force into exile anyone who threatens 
his grip on power, all the while enrich-
ing himself beyond anyone’s wildest 
imagination while ordinary Russians, 
especially out in the countryside of 
Russia, live in squalid conditions. 
One of his latest victims is Vladimir 
Kara-Murza, a Russian patriot and a 
friend I had the privilege of hosting in 
my office just 4 months ago. As a mat-
ter of fact, I have hosted him several 
times. 
Today, Vladimir Kara-Murza spends 
his days in a prison cell, where the 
only thing he can see through the win-
dow is a barbed wire fence. What was 
his crime? He simply spoke the truth 
about Putin’s war on Ukraine. His 
trial—if it can even be called a trial— 
was held in secret. No journalists, no 
diplomats, or spectators of any kind 
were allowed to be there. And for his 
offense of talking about the Russian 
war against Ukraine, he now faces up 
to 15 years in prison. 
This is not the first time the Russian 
dictator has tried to silence him. Mr. 
Kara-Murza has been poisoned twice— 
in 2015 and 2017—and almost died in 
both cases. Since then, his wife and 
three children have had to live abroad, 
although he himself has chosen to 
spend most of his time in Russia. 
In a recent interview with National 
Review, his wife Evgenia explained why 
he insists on working in Russia: 
He believes that he would not have the 
moral right to call on people to fight if he 
were not sharing the same risks. 
As Mr. Kara-Murza put it in a recent 
CNN interview the day of his arrest, he 
said: 
The biggest gift we could give the Kremlin 
. . . would be to just give up and run, and 
that’s all they want from us. 
What a contrast in character to the 
man currently running the Kremlin. 
The National Review story goes on to 
describe Mr. Kara-Murza’s courageous 
work for democracy through the eyes 
of his wife Evgenia, as well as the costs 
that he and his family have endured, 
along with so many other Russian dis-
sidents. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent at this point to have printed in 
the RECORD the National Review story 
that I referred to. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the National Review, May 31, 2022] 
IN DARK TIMES, A BRAVE MAN 
(By Jay Nordlinger) 
On March 15, Vladimir Kara-Murza gave a 
speech to the Arizona legislature. ‘‘These are 
very dark times in Russia,’’ he said. ‘‘These 
are times when we have hundreds of political 
prisoners, and that number is only going to 
grow.’’ Less than a month later, Kara-Murza 
himself became a political prisoner. 
Born in 1981, he is one of the most promi-
nent opposition figures in Russia. (Given the 
state of things, we should probably return to 
the word ‘‘dissidents.’’) He is a politician, 
journalist, and activist. A proponent of de-
mocracy. For 15 years, he worked alongside 
Boris Nemtsov, the opposition leader. They 
became the closest of friends. Nemtsov was 
godfather to one of Kara-Murza’s children. 
(‘‘In Russia,’’ Kara-Murza once told me, 
‘‘that makes you family.’’) 
Together, they worked for passage of the 
Magnitsky Act in the U.S. Congress. This is 
the act that allows the government to sanc-
tion individual human-rights abusers rather 
than whole peoples or societies. Nemtsov and 
Kara-Murza were sitting in the gallery on 
November 16, 2012, when the House passed 
the act. Nemtsov commented, ‘‘This is the 
most pro-Russian law ever enacted by a for-
eign government.’’ At last, the persecutors 
of Russians would face consequences. 
On February 27, 2015, Boris Nemtsov was 
murdered—gunned down within sight of the 
Kremlin. This had a deep impact on the Rus-
sian democracy movement, and it had a deep 
impact on Vladimir Kara-Murza, personally. 
He told me, ‘‘My life is divided into before 
and after February 27, 2015.’’ 
His wife, Evgenia, confirms the importance 
of Nemtsov’s murder to her husband. ‘‘He 
will never come to terms with it. I just know 
him all too well. Boris Nemtsov was his 
teacher, his mentor, and then he became his 
close friend.’’ Plus, ‘‘he was family.’’ 
Three months after Nemtsov’s murder, 
Vladimir Kara-Murza himself was nearly 
murdered. He was subject to a poison attack, 
of the kind for which Vladimir Putin’s 
agents have become infamous. After he re-
covered, Kara-Murza kept working, not 
scared off. Approximately two years later— 
in February 2017—he was again almost mur-
dered. Again in a poison attack. 
On the floor of the U.S. Senate, John 
McCain made a statement about Kara- 
Murza, a friend: ‘‘Vladimir has once again 
paid the price for his gallantry and integrity, 
for placing the interests of the Russian peo-
ple above his own interest.’’ Congressman Ed 
Royce, then the chairman of the House For-
eign Affairs Committee, called Kara-Murza 
‘‘one of the bravest people I know.’’ 
For the record, lots of people have called 
Kara-Murza ‘‘one of the bravest people I 
know.’’ Also for the record: McCain asked 
Kara-Murza to serve as a pallbearer at his fu-
neral, which he did, when the time came 
(September 2018). 
After the second poison attack, doctors 
told Kara-Murza, ‘‘If there’s a third one, you 
won’t survive it.’’ 
Last year, a team of independent inves-
tigators was able to identify the exact unit 
of the Russian secret police that poisoned 
Kara-Murza—and Alexei Navalny and others. 
(Navalny is the current Russian opposition 
leader, and also a political prisoner.) The in-
vestigators pinpointed the agents who car-
ried out the attacks. 
Wrote Kara-Murza, ‘‘My emotions are dif-
ficult to express with words. It’s one thing to 
know intellectually that someone has tried 
to kill you—and it’s quite another to see the 
names and photographs of the actual people 
who did this.’’ 
For some years, Evgenia Kara-Murza and 
the couple’s children have lived abroad. ‘‘Ob-
viously, it’s not an ideal situation,’’ Vladi-
mir told me in 2017, ‘‘but it has to be this 
way. I go back and forth, but I spend most of 
my time in Russia.’’ He was willing to put 
his own neck on the line, but he was not will-
ing to do the same with his family’s. 
Many people asked him, or pleaded with 
him, to work in the West, rather than in 
Russia itself. That way, he would be safer, if 
not entirely shielded from danger. Nemtsov 
was dead. Kara-Murza almost died, twice. 
Wasn’t this enough? Hadn’t he paid his dues, 
so to speak? Did he really need to be on Rus-
sian soil, making it easier for Putin’s men? 
Kara-Murza rejected all entreaties, saying 
that he belonged in Russia. 
‘‘What does Evgenia think of all this?’’ I 
asked him in 2017. He answered, ‘‘If you ask 
her, she’ll say, ‘I knew what I was signing up 
for.’ ’’ Then, with a hint of a blush, he said, 
‘‘I’m grateful to have such a woman in my 
life.’’ 
Today, Evgenia tells me the following: 
‘‘When we were dating, 20 years ago, I was 
looking at him and thinking, ‘You know, I 
can imagine spending my life with this man. 
He’s smart, he’s funny, he’s honorable. He 
has so much integrity.’ Later, when the 
poisonings 
and 
persecutions 
began, 
I 
thought, ‘I wish our lives could be a little 
more boring.’ But I do admire Vladimir. I’ve 
always admired and respected him for his 
principled stand, and I would never have him 
any different.’’ 
Explaining Vladimir’s insistence on work-
ing in Russia, Evgenia says, ‘‘He believes 
that he would not have the moral right to 
call on people to fight if he were not sharing 
the same risks.’’ 
Back in 2017, I asked Vladimir whether his 
name would protect him. He was a friend of 
U.S. politicians, he had been featured on 60 
Minutes, he had spoken at forums around the 
world. He was a bit of a celebrity. Kara- 
Murza looked at me and said, in effect, ‘‘Are

you kidding?’’ Then he said (I will quote di-
rectly), ‘‘If they can kill the leader of the op-
position on the bridge next to the Krem-
lin’’—he was speaking of the Nemtsov mur-
der—‘‘they can do anything.’’ 
Vladimir Putin launched his all-out as-
sault on Ukraine on February 24 of this year. 
Kara-Murza, naturally, cried against this as-
sault. On March 15, he gave his speech to the 
Arizona legislature. On April 11, he appeared 
on CNN, from Moscow. He spoke of the Putin 
regime’s history of murder. Mincing no 
words, he said, ‘‘This regime that is in power 
in our country today—it’s not just corrupt, 
it’s not just kleptocratic, it’s not just au-
thoritarian. It is a regime of murderers. And 
it is important to say it out loud.’’ 
He went on to say, ‘‘It’s tragic, frankly, 
that it took a large-scale war in Europe for 
most Western leaders to finally open their 
eyes to the true nature of this regime.’’ 
His interviewer asked him about being in 
Russia, after all that had happened to him, 
and others. Wasn’t he afraid of being killed? 
Kara-Murza answered, ‘‘Look, I’m a Russian 
politician, I have to be in Russia, it’s my 
home country. I think the biggest gift we 
could give to the Kremlin—those of us who 
are in opposition—would be to just give up 
and run, and that’s all they want from us.’’ 
He was arrested that night. Five or six 
agents rushed at him when he was returning 
to his apartment building and parking his 
car. They dragged him into a van and took 
him to a police station. He was denied the 
right to call a lawyer. The next day, the au-
thorities sentenced him to 15 days in prison 
for resisting arrest (something Kara-Murza 
had not done). It is typical for the govern-
ment to sentence a dissident to 15 days on 
some little charge, while they cook up a big-
ger charge. Agents took Kara-Murza to a de-
tention center. 
Eventually, he did have lawyers, and very 
good ones: Vadim Prokhorov and Olga 
Mikhailova. (The latter is also lawyer to 
Navalny.) Kara-Murza does not have access 
to a phone or the Internet or anything like 
that. But, in detention, he was able to dic-
tate a column to one of his lawyers. 
On this matter of resisting arrest, Kara- 
Murza said the following: 
Sofia Kalistratova, the legendary Moscow 
lawyer who defended dissidents in the ‘‘anti- 
Soviet’’ trials of the 1960s and 1970s, told her 
charges: ‘‘Everyone else may cross the street 
on a red light, but you must always cross on 
green.’’ She knew that her clients couldn’t 
give the authorities the slightest excuse to 
accuse them of breaking the law. 
I have always tried to follow this principle. 
In the column he dictated, Kara-Murza 
also reported a very interesting detail. When 
agents brought him to the detention center, 
they rang the doorbell and said to the person 
opening, ‘‘Here’s a political for you. They 
should have called you from headquarters.’’ 
(By ‘‘a political,’’ they meant a political 
prisoner, not a common criminal.) 
‘‘Among the inmates in the special deten-
tion center,’’ said KaraMurza in his column, 
‘‘are a young man and woman who had 
staged a protest in response to the murders 
in Bucha, Ukraine.’’ Also, there were ‘‘stu-
dents of the Higher School of Economics who 
were detained for an antiwar demonstra-
tion.’’ 
Altogether, some 15,000 Russians have been 
detained 
for 
protesting 
the 
assault 
on 
Ukraine. These people have assumed great 
risks and have exhibited notable bravery. In 
a column before his arrest, Kara-Murza re-
called the seven people who protested in Red 
Square against Moscow’s invasion of Czecho-
slovakia in August 1968. (Horrible things 
happened to them, naturally.) The Kremlin 
of the time was saying that the whole nation 
supported the invasion. One of the pro-
testers, Natalia Gorbanevskaya, a poet, re-
flected on those days, many years later. 
‘‘A nation minus me,’’ she said, ‘‘is not an 
entire nation. A nation minus ten, a hun-
dred, a thousand people is not an entire na-
tion.’’ So, thanks to the Red Square protest, 
the government ‘‘could no longer say that 
there was nationwide approval for the inva-
sion of Czechoslovakia.’’ 
On April 22, when Kara-Murza had been in 
prison for a week and a half, the authorities 
lodged their bigger charge against him. They 
accused him of violating a new law, insti-
tuted on March 5. This law essentially crim-
inalizes any criticism of the Ukraine war 
whatsoever. It is punishable by up to 15 years 
in prison. 
Before the war, there were a few inde-
pendent media outlets left in Russia—the 
venerable radio station Echo of Moscow, for 
example, 
and 
the 
venerable 
newspaper 
Novaya Gazeta. (Over the years, six of the 
paper’s correspondents have been murdered.) 
Now all independent media have been shut 
down. Social media have been blocked. In an-
other of his pre-arrest columns, Kara-Murza 
wrote, ‘‘Near-total darkness has descended 
on Russia’s information space with fright-
ening speed.’’ 
The first person charged under the new 
law—the 
March 
5 
law—was 
a 
blogger, 
Veronika Belotserkovskaya, who does not 
live in Russia, but in France. Her response: 
‘‘I was officially recognized as a decent per-
son!’’ In Kara-Murza’s case, the authorities 
cited the Arizona speech in particular. As of 
this writing, he is awaiting a court date. 
Earlier this year, I talked with Kara-Murza 
about what seemed to me the increasing, gal-
loping re-Sovietization of Russia. The gov-
ernment had shut down Memorial—the lead-
ing civil-society organization in the country. 
Memorial was founded at the urging of 
Andrei 
Sakharov 
in 
the 
late 
1980s. 
Sakharov—the 
great 
scientist 
and 
dis-
sident—was its first chairman. The purpose 
of the group was to uncover and tell the 
truth about the past, and to promote free-
dom and democracy in the present. 
As Kara-Murza pointed out to me, plenty 
of Soviet men are in the Russian government 
now—starting with the KGB colonel at the 
top. Who wants to be reminded of his past 
crimes? Or his present ones? 
In Russia’s supreme court last December, 
the chief prosecutor, Alexei Zhafyarov, said, 
‘‘Memorial creates a false image of the So-
viet Union as a terrorist state.’’ He also said 
that Memorial ‘‘makes us repent of the So-
viet past, instead of remembering glorious 
history’’—and ‘‘probably because someone is 
paying for it.’’ 
Over the past eight years—since Putin’s 
initial invasion of Ukraine—Kara-Murza and 
I have had several conversations about just 
that: Ukraine. Kara-Murza’s view is that 
Putin is very, very nervous about a demo-
cratic example in that country. It’s one 
thing if New Zealand, let’s say, is a democ-
racy. New Zealand is far away, and, besides, 
it’s ‘‘Anglo.’’ But Ukraine? There are many 
ties between Ukraine and Russia: cultural, 
religious, linguistic. Millions of families 
have direct ties across the border. And if 
Russians see that Ukraine has a decent, 
open, democratic society . . . they may de-
mand the same for themselves, which makes 
Putin and his men very nervous indeed. 
In one of our conversations, Kara-Murza 
put it this way: ‘‘A successful democratic ex-
periment in Ukraine presents an existential 
threat to Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian 
kleptocracy in Russia.’’ 
It is Kara-Murza’s strong belief that Rus-
sia, one day, will be free and democratic. 
People should avoid ‘‘cultural condescen-
sion,’’ he says. That is a phrase he borrows 
from Ronald Reagan. In his Westminster 
speech of 1982, Reagan said, ‘‘Democracy al-
ready flourishes in countries with very dif-
ferent cultures and historical experiences. It 
would be cultural condescension, or worse, to 
say that any people prefer dictatorship to de-
mocracy.’’ Earlier this year, Kara-Murza 
told me, ‘‘I have absolutely no doubt that 
one day we will have a normal, modern, ac-
countable democratic government in Russia. 
There’s no reason that our nation is destined 
to be an outlier in Europe or the world, and 
to live under the yoke of a dictatorship.’’ 
At the moment, Vladimir Kara-Murza sits 
in prison, and faces many years of it. His 
friends and allies are making as much noise 
as they can. Charles Krauthammer once told 
me about something that Meg Greenfield had 
said to him. She was the editorial-page edi-
tor of the Washington Post. When the life of 
Sakharov hung in the balance, she wanted 
something about him in her pages at least 
once a week, she said. That way, the Post 
might help keep him alive. 
Chief among the shouters, or campaigners, 
today for Kara-Murza is his wife. I think of 
Avital Sharansky, who campaigned for her 
husband, Anatoly (later Natan), during his 
nine years in the Gulag. She had obtained a 
visa to go to Israel, he had not. Sharansky 
told me a few years ago, ‘‘The biggest mis-
take the KGB made was letting Avita I out.’’ 
‘‘I’ve never been a public person,’’ Evgenia 
Kara-Murza says, ‘‘and I’ve never enjoyed 
being in the public eye. I am a quite intro-
verted person, so I like working from home, 
and I like taking care of the kids, but unfor-
tunately the situation sometimes changes, 
and I emerge when my husband is either 
poisoned or thrown in jail, because this is 
my partner, my soulmate, and I am prepared 
to do everything I can to bring my children’s 
father home.’’ 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. Kara-Murza’s im-
prisonment is part of Mr. Putin’s larg-
er assault on what remains of political 
freedom in Russia. In Mr. Kara-Murza’s 
words, Putin’s regime has gone ‘‘from 
highly authoritarian to near-totali-
tarian almost overnight.’’ 
In March, Russian officials passed a 
new censorship law forbidding all criti-
cism of Mr. Putin’s war in Ukraine. 
That law has been the basis for more 
16,000 arrests since the war began in 
February, including that of Mr. Kara- 
Murza. Another 2,400 Russians have 
been charged with administrative of-
fenses for speaking out against the 
war. Meanwhile, Putin’s propaganda 
machine is ramping up. Independent 
Russian media outlets have all but 
vanished, having been blocked, shut 
down, or forced out of the country by 
the Kremlin. 
The last embers of freedom in Russia 
are going cold. Putin’s crackdown on 
domestic freedom began in 2003, when 
Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested on 
trumped-up charges of tax fraud after 
he simply criticized the government. A 
former 
member 
of 
the 
elite, 
Mr. 
Khodorkovsky had successfully led the 
Yukos Oil Company through privatiza-
tion after the Iron Curtain fell. And 
contrary to the Kremlin’s claims, the 
company consistently paid its taxes. 
But that didn’t stop Vladimir Putin 
from plundering its assets and throw-
ing Mr. Khodorkovsky in jail, where he 
stayed for 10 years. 
I would note that just before his ar-
rest, Mr. Khodorkovsky displayed the

same courage and patriotism that we 
now see in Vladimir Kara-Murza. Like 
Mr. Kara-Murza, he knew very well he 
could go to jail for speaking out 
against 
the 
government, 
but 
Mr. 
Khodorkovsky did so anyway and re-
fused to flee the country, saying: 
I would prefer to be a political prisoner 
rather than a political immigrant. 
Of course, by then, Mr. Putin had al-
ready shown himself willing to violate 
the international laws of war, having 
leveled the Chechen capital of Grozny 
in his own Republic of Russia in 1999. 
In 2008, he launched a new assault on 
international law with the invasion of 
Georgia. In 2014, he started a bloody 
war in eastern Ukraine. In 2016, Rus-
sian dictator Putin and his forces at-
tacked the Syrian city of Aleppo, kill-
ing hundreds of civilians and pro-
longing the rule of Bashar al-Assad. 
Meanwhile, Putin ramped up his at-
tacks on domestic freedom as well. In 
2015, Boris Nemtsov, leader of the 
democratic opposition, former Deputy 
Prime Minister of Russia, was shot to 
death in broad daylight just yards 
away from the Kremlin. Three months 
later, Mr. Kara-Murza was poisoned for 
the first time. More recently, in 2020, 
Alexei Navalny, the current leader of 
the opposition, was himself poisoned 
and had to seek treatment in Berlin. 
This is Vladimir Putin’s Russia today. 
When Navalny recovered, he chose to 
return to Moscow, knowing the risks, 
and immediately upon landing, he was 
arrested. 
This is the deplorable state of Russia 
and freedom under Vladimir Putin. 
Time and again, he has shown that he 
is bent on stamping out the aspirations 
of his people for freedom and the rule 
of law. 
As leader of the free world, America 
must continue to condemn Putin’s law-
less acts and stand in solidarity with 
our Russian friends who are coura-
geously fighting against all odds for a 
better future in Russia and are suf-
fering as a result. 
These are modern-day heroes—Alexei 
Navalny, 
Vladimir 
Kara-Murza—and 
we should not forget them. 
My friend the distinguished senior 
Senator from Maryland, Mr. CARDIN, 
and I, along with Congressmen STEVE 
COHEN and JOE WILSON, are the four 
House and Senate leaders of the Hel-
sinki 
Commission, 
which 
monitors 
human rights in former Soviet coun-
tries. We recently sent a joint letter to 
President Biden calling on the admin-
istration to name and sanction all of 
those who have been involved in the ar-
rest, detention, and persecution of 
Vladimir Kara-Murza. I issue that call 
again today, and I invite my colleagues 
from both parties to stand with Vladi-
mir Kara-Murza and work for his re-
lease. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to be able to com-
plete my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the confirmation of 
Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez to be an As-
sistant Secretary of Defense for Health 
Affairs, or ASDHA. 
The Defense Department is respon-
sible for the health and welfare of over 
1.3 million Americans who are en-
trusted with protecting our Nation. In 
order to ensure they get the care they 
need and deserve, the DOD must have 
an Assistant Secretary of Defense in 
place to lead their health affairs. 
This position is the principal adviser 
to the Secretary of Defense for all 
health and force health protection poli-
cies, programs, activities, and the Inte-
grated Disability Evaluation System. 
The ASDHA is responsible for the exe-
cution of the DOD medical mission, to 
provide and maintain physical and 
mental health readiness for medical 
services and support to members of the 
military services, their families, and 
those held in the control of the mili-
tary services. 
Dr. 
Martinez-Lopez 
is 
eminently 
qualified for the position and has an 
impressive history of public service. 
Dr. Martinez-Lopez graduated from 
medical school in 1978. He retired from 
the U.S. Army as a major general and 
was the first Latino to head the Army 
Medical Research and Materiel Com-
mand at Fort Detrick, MD. He is the 
former director of the Army’s world-
wide medical research, acquisition, and 
logistics program, overseeing a vast re-
search portfolio that included cancer, 
trauma, infectious diseases, aviation 
medicine, and telemedicine research. 
Dr. Martinez-Lopez also directed the 
premier national biological and chem-
ical defense laboratories and research 
program and led the development of 
the National Biodefense Campus at 
Fort Detrick. 
He served as the commanding general 
of the Center for Health Promotion and 
Preventive Medicine, where he directed 
a worldwide public health organization 
and was responsible for preventive 
medicine, 
health 
promotion 
and 
wellness, global medical surveillance, 
occupational 
and 
environmental 
health, and health risk communica-
tion. 
Dr. Martinez-Lopez has an extensive 
military and medical background that 
makes him eminently qualified to fill 
this critically important role. But Re-
publican obstruction has left us with-
out a confirmed Assistant Secretary 
for Health Affairs for nearly a year, en-
dangering the health of our service-
members and the safety of our Nation. 
Unfortunately, Dr. Lopez is not the 
only critically important civilian DOD 
nominee Senate Republicans are block-
ing. Just yesterday, Chairman REED 
came to the floor to ask for unanimous 
consent on the nominees to serve as in-
spector general of DOD, Assistant Sec-
retary of the Navy, and a judge of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed 
Forces. 
This unprecedented obstruction must 
end, and we must fill these important 
positions, 
including 
Dr. 
Martinez- 
Lopez, as quickly as possible. 
I urge my colleagues to confirm this 
nominee. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate consider the fol-
lowing nomination: Calendar No. 779, 
Lester Martinez-Lopez, of Florida, to 
be an Assistant Secretary of Defense; 
that the Senate vote on the nomina-
tion without intervening action or de-
bate; that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table; and that any statements related 
to the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object, I rise in ob-
jection to this nominee due to his sup-
port of President Biden’s irrational and 
now proven foolish vaccine mandates 
for our military. 
Last August, the Biden administra-
tion imposed a COVID–19 vaccine man-
date across the entire military. This 
led to the expulsion of thousands of 
qualified, 
honorable 
servicemembers 
who elected not to receive the vaccine. 
This DOD mandate failed to account 
for immunity to the virus many troops 
gained 
through 
natural 
infection, 
which we now know is equal to or 
greater than the effectiveness of the 
vaccine. The mandate also failed to ac-
count for the fact that these men and 
women are our bravest and healthiest 
Americans, with strong immune sys-
tems. 
Recently, we learned that the Army 
cut roughly 60,000 National Guard and 
Reserve members from pay and bene-
fits for refusing to take the COVID vac-
cine at the beginning of July. This de-
cision was made at a time when more 
than 30 percent of its recruitment slots 
are not fulfilled. 
The recruiting crisis has gotten so 
bad that the Army is now placing en-
listees who exceed body fat standards 
into a dietary and exercise program in 
order to lose weight. This manpower 
shortage could result in undermanned 
units and potentially longer deploy-
ments as well as greater dependence on 
National Guardsmen to meet mission 
goals. 
These personnel shortages are clear 
and obvious, and they are getting 
worse. Yet the ideologues in charge of 
this administration refuse to drop the 
vaccine mandate for the military. 
There is no longer any rational basis to 
persist in this demand other than as a 
deliberate campaign to punish dis-
senting opinions and oppress political 
enemies. 
The Department also appears to be 
going out of its way to deny religious 
accommodations for our troops. More 
than 
24,000 
members 
across 
the 
branches have submitted religious ac-
commodation requests. Almost all have

been rejected. The Air Force approved 
fewer than 130 of the more than 9,000 
religious requests submitted by air-
men. 
It is time for this administration to 
do what is morally right and patriotic, 
what is decent and sensible and pru-
dent for the readiness of our military, 
and drop this vaccine mandate. Fur-
ther, the Defense Department should 
reinstate those servicemembers who 
have been expelled for this reason, re-
turn them to their previous positions, 
and provide backpay for time missed. 
But until they do so, I will continue 
to object to this nominee. And, there-
fore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, very 
briefly, the fact that my colleague is 
objecting to the consequences of not 
adhering to the requirement for vac-
cination is not within the purview of 
Dr. Lester Martinez-Lopez. So, there-
fore, their objection as to this par-
ticular nominee is misplaced and, in 
my view, irrelevant. 
I again call on my colleagues to en-
able this nominee to come forward 
under unanimous consent. 
VOTE ON PRESSMAN NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question is, Will 
the Senate advise and consent to the 
Pressman nomination? 
Ms. HASSAN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I announce that the 
Senator from Illinois (Ms. DUCKWORTH), 
the Senator from Illinois (Mr. DURBIN), 
the 
Senator 
from 
Vermont 
(Mr. 
LEAHY), the Senator from West Vir-

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, a few 
weeks ago, the fate of the CHIPS Act, 
our collective effort to shore up the 
vulnerable 
semiconductor 
supply 
chain, was in limbo. Republicans said 
we would not move forward with what 
was then known as USICA, the U.S. In-
novation and Competition Act, while 
Democrats were crafting a partisan 
reckless massive tax and spending bill 
behind closed doors. 
Then Senator MANCHIN, the Senator 
from West Virginia, made a decision 
that angered most of his Democratic 
colleagues—he slammed the door on 
the climate and tax provisions and rec-
onciliation. He said: 
Until we see the July inflation figures— 
Which we haven’t seen yet— 
until we see the July Federal reserve inter-
est rates, then let’s wait. 
He noted that families were strug-
gling to buy such essentials as gasoline 
and groceries and added: 
I can’t make that decision basically on 
taxes of any type. 
That was what I will call the old Joe. 
After we received assurances pri-
vately from some Senate Democrats, 
including the staff of the Senate major-
ity leader, that the tax and climate 
provisions were off the table, we were 
able to move forward with USICA and 
the funding of this vulnerable semicon-
ductor supply chain that is an impor-
tant part of the bill that the House is 
voting on today. 
So Republicans and Democrats went 
to work, negotiating in good faith to 
reach an agreement because we recog-
nized that the vulnerability of our 
semiconductor supply chain was an 
economic and national security exis-
tential threat because 90 percent of the 
advanced semiconductors in the world 
that power everything from your cell 
phone to the F–35, to the Stinger or the 
Javelin missiles that are being used in 
Ukraine today—90 percent of those 
come from overseas, and the United 
States makes zero percent of them. 
That was the vulnerability and the risk 
we were exposed to, so that is why we 
worked so hard on a bipartisan basis to 
pass what used to be called Endless 
Frontier. I guess it has had about four 
or five different names so far, but it 
started, in my mind, with the CHIPS 
for America Act that Mr. WARNER, the 
Senator from Virginia, and I intro-
duced in June of 2020. 
So we all celebrated with a bipar-
tisan press conference just in the LBJ 
Room over here, but then shortly after 
that 
bipartisan 
announcement, 
we 
learned some astonishing news: The 
climate and tax provisions apparently

July 28, 2022 
were never off the table despite what 
we had been told. 
Apparently, Democrats—specifically, 
the 
majority 
leader 
and 
Senator 
MANCHIN—just moved those discussions 
out of the public eye, into a secret 
back room. And I pretty much believe 
that other Democratic colleagues were 
not clued in on those negotiations. 
That is my impression. It was a secret 
deal between the majority leader and 
Senator MANCHIN. 
Well, as I said, the CHIPS Act was 
part of this larger China competitive-
ness bill passed around 1 o’clock, and it 
was just 4 hours later that Senator 
MANCHIN sent out a press release that 
‘‘Build Back Broke’’ was now on track. 
After saying repeatedly he would not 
support such reckless policies, he has 
done an Olympic-worthy flip-flop, and 
there is simply no denying it. 
Let me talk about the new JOE. 
It simply can’t be overstated how 
dramatic this reversal is. Democratic 
Senators called me and texted me yes-
terday after Senator MANCHIN’s an-
nouncement. 
One said: 
I am so shocked and upset. 
Another said: 
I am appalled. 
A member of the President’s Cabinet 
said: 
I hope you know and trust that I had abso-
lutely no idea this was going on. 
Just 2 weeks ago, Senator MANCHIN 
said he wouldn’t support the climate 
policies and tax increases out of fear 
that it would fan the flames of infla-
tion. 
Last month, as we will recall, infla-
tion hit a new four-decade high. Every-
day expenses for food, groceries, and 
other necessities of life were up more 
than 9 percent from just a year ago. 
Our colleague from West Virginia said 
he told the Democratic leader it would 
be ‘‘wrong’’ and ‘‘not prudent’’ to move 
forward while inflation was at a record 
high. Unfortunately, it didn’t take long 
for that sense of fiscal responsibility to 
fade. 
I don’t know the details about the se-
cret deal between Senator MANCHIN and 
Senator SCHUMER that resulted in this 
reversal, but I have to say, it was ugly. 
Now Senator MANCHIN not only sup-
ports the ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ bill, he 
now said it is his proposal—he, in ef-
fect, wrote it—and it includes the same 
policies that he previously opposed. 
Tax hikes on working families and 
small businesses, Green New Deal cli-
mate policies, socialist price controls 
on prescription drugs, things like sub-
sidies for wealthy purchasers of elec-
tric vehicles—forget the fact that 
somebody who can’t afford an electric 
vehicle, who has to drive an old 
clunker, perhaps, or buy a used car— 
they are the ones subsidizing wealthy 
people buying electric vehicles—it is 
all in there. 
Democrats could not have picked a 
worse time to push this reckless, irre-
sponsible bill. This morning’s news on 
the state of the economy confirms 
what 
millions 
of 
Americans 
have 
known for months: that the Biden re-
cession is officially here. Our economy 
is not just stuck in the mud; it is sink-
ing. Families and small businesses de-
serve better than a toxic combination 
of higher prices and feeble economic 
growth. Instead of helping the people 
survive this recession, our Democratic 
colleagues want to push them even 
deeper into the hole. 
In 2008, Senator SCHUMER
himself, 
the majority leader, said that raising 
taxes during a recession was a bad idea. 
President Obama said exactly the 
same thing. In 2009, President Obama— 
in the aftermath of the great recession 
due to the financial crisis in 2008— 
President Obama said virtually the 
same thing that Senator SCHUMER said: 
The last thing you want to do is raise taxes 
in the middle of a recession. 
And that is exactly where we are. 
The following year, in 2010, Senator 
MANCHIN agreed with Senator SCHUMER 
and President Obama. He said: 
I don’t think during a time of recession 
you mess with any of the taxes or increase 
any taxes. 
That is the old JOE. That is the same 
Senator who is now proposing to raise 
taxes on families in the middle of a re-
cession. 
Now, here is the real joke, but I guess 
the joke is on all of us: They are call-
ing it the Inflation Reduction Act. 
What an insult to the intelligence of 
the American people. Do they think 
anybody will be fooled? Do they think 
the American people are so stupid that 
they will believe this is an honest at-
tempt to address inflation? There is 
not a chance. This proposal is a wolf in 
sheep’s clothing. Our Democratic col-
leagues can try to rebrand the ‘‘Build 
Back Broke’’ bill that they tried to 
pass earlier this year all they want, 
but it is filled with the same rotten 
policies that will hurt families, small 
businesses, and energy producers, while 
the President, by the way, goes to 
Saudi Arabia hat in hand, asking the 
leader of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
to produce more oil overseas rather 
than encourage domestic production 
here in America. 
If this bill were to pass, it would 
eliminate any chance we had of escap-
ing the recession policies that Demo-
crats have landed us in. 
Families are being crushed by the 
worst inflation in four decades. For 
every dollar you have, it is worth 91 
cents in purchasing power because of 
the broken policies of the Biden admin-
istration. But it is not the politicians 
who pay the price; we are doing just 
fine. It is the working families all 
across this country who are paying the 
price for Democrats’ war on American 
energy, for example. And they are sick 
and tired of being told by Washington 
Democrats that you can tax and spend 
our way out of this mess. 
I have some bad news: If the Demo-
cratic leader can manage to keep all 50 
Democrats on board, it is going to get 
worse. Our only hope is that a single 
Democratic Senator will oppose this 
massive, irresponsible bill, and it only 
takes one in a 50–50 Senate. 
Not only will this bill have a dev-
astating impact on the American peo-
ple, it will absolutely paralyze this 
Chamber. 
There have been recent discussions 
about, well, amidst polarization, there 
is possibility for bipartisan coopera-
tion, and I have been proud to be a part 
of some of that bipartisan cooperation. 
I think we have done some important 
things for the American people. 
But the Senate functions on trust. 
There are only 100 of us, and the rela-
tionships and the confidence that we 
have that when somebody looks you in 
the eye and tells you something, that 
they are going to stick with it, is im-
portant to negotiating in good faith 
and building consensus that is nec-
essary to pass legislation. That is the 
only way we can pass legislation—work 
in a bipartisan, candid, good-faith way 
to get things done, like our mental 
health and school safety bill recently. 
That trust was eviscerated yesterday. 
Senators MANCHIN and SCHUMER did 
not draft this 725-page bill in the 4 
hours between the passage of the 
CHIPS Act and Senator MANCHIN’s 
press release. They have been working 
on this the entire time, when they told 
us it was off the table. How is this 
Chamber supposed to function if we 
don’t have at least some modicum of 
trust in what our colleagues tell us? 
How can we negotiate in good faith, 
compromise where necessary, and get 
things done together after the majority 
leader and the Senator from West Vir-
ginia pull a stunt like this? 
The American people are sometimes 
left to wonder whether our institu-
tions, including this one, can work 
anymore. Well, I can only speak for 
this Senator when I say: This betrayal 
is an absolute declaration of political 
warfare. 
For years, many of our Democratic 
colleagues have claimed that the Sen-
ate is broken because of the filibuster. 
They act as though a procedural vote 
with the 60-vote threshold is an end of 
democracy as we know it. But look 
where we are now. The Democratic 
leader is crafting secret deals in back 
rooms. He is keeping members of his 
own political party in the dark, such 
that they have to apologize to people 
like me who have been willing to trust 
that what people say—that their word 
is their bond. 
Look, if somebody can’t agree with 
me, I would prefer they tell me out-
right, and then we can figure out where 
we can agree if we can’t agree in some 
areas. But to look you in the eye and 
tell you one thing and then to do an-
other is absolutely unforgiveable. 
Now the majority leader is trying to 
abuse the rules of the Senate to pass a 
$700 billion partisan spending bill in 
the next week, in the next matter of 
days—a bill that was only announced 
in a press release yesterday.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3768 
July 28, 2022 
The Senate is not broken, but I am 
afraid, if this stunt pays off, Democrats 
are about to break it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho is recognized. 
NATO 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise 
today, colleagues, to urge the Senate 
to proceed quickly—quickly—to the 
consideration of the accession proto-
cols for Finland and Sweden to join 
NATO. 
Once again the Senate has been given 
the responsibility of offering advice 
and consent to ratifying the accession 
of two new members to the North At-
lantic Treaty Organization. We have 
been advising aggressively for quite 
some time, and it is time now to move 
to the consent portion of getting this 
done. NATO is the most successful po-
litical-military alliance in history. It 
helped bring down the Soviet Union, 
and it united Europe so it could rebuild 
economically. 
The Senate has the opportunity to 
expand NATO and bring both Finland 
and Sweden into the alliance. Over the 
years, these countries never sought 
membership. They were content to just 
partner with NATO, but they did not 
join. However, Putin’s attempt to re-
write the security landscape in Europe 
with his invasion of Ukraine convinced 
the people of Finland and Sweden that 
they should become formal members of 
NATO. Why wouldn’t they? 
After the past 2 weeks—and really 
the entire summer—the Senate Foreign 
Relations 
Committee 
has 
carefully 
considered and discussed the prospec-
tive membership of our longtime part-
ners, Finland and Sweden. 
The Senate has already shown bipar-
tisan support for Finland and Sweden 
joining NATO. As my colleagues and I 
have laid out in a resolution of support 
in public statements at Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee meetings and 
hearings in June and in the committee 
report submitted to the floor along 
with the protocols, Finland and Swe-
den will make model members of the 
NATO alliance. 
Once approved by all 30 current mem-
bers of NATO, these two nations will 
become integral members of the alli-
ance. Both have strong and capable 
militaries and are already net contrib-
utors to the security alliance. Al-
though militarily unaligned for dec-
ades, Finland and Sweden have long de-
fended Europe’s high north—a region 
becoming even more important with 
the competition from Russia and China 
in the Arctic. 
Both have already demonstrated the 
interoperability and commitment nec-
essary to join the alliance. Finland al-
ready spends more than 2 percent of its 
GDP on defense, and Sweden laid out 
its plan to reach that mark shortly— 
both requirements for joining NATO. 
These countries also bring additional 
capabilities to NATO. Both are inti-
mately familiar with the north and 
east flank of Europe. Finland also 
trains U.S. forces in cold weather oper-
ations and the Finnish Navy is espe-
cially suited to operate and defend the 
Baltic Sea, where some Navy ships 
have less maneuverability, being a 
blue-water Navy. 
They have both participated in NATO 
missions in Afghanistan, the Balkans, 
and Iraq. In fact, these countries oper-
ated with less restrictions on their 
militaries in these missions than other 
NATO members. Finland and Sweden 
also share our democratic values, have 
strong military and defense industries, 
and extensive experience in Russian 
matters. 
One only has to take a look at a map 
to see the benefits of adding Finland 
and Sweden to NATO. With their prox-
imity to the Baltic States—the Baltic 
States, which are small—they are well- 
positioned to provide support, if need-
ed, to our current Baltic NATO allies, 
just as the rest of NATO would if the 
Baltic States have a problem with Rus-
sia. 
Adding these two nations as full 
members to our alliance will further 
deter any temptation by Russia to en-
gage in military adventurism in the 
Baltic area or the Arctic regions. Al-
though my sense is Russia has already 
learned this year of the ineptitude, 
clumsiness, and just plain inabilities of 
its way-overrated military, which can’t 
even win against a small, substantially 
less-equipped adversary, even when 
Russia used barbaric medieval tactics. 
Russia’s efforts have been pitiful and, 
at the same time, despicable. 
Many Senators have already given 
firm statements of support for this suc-
cession, and we deserve the timely 
chance to make our support known 
through a vote. Let’s get on with it. 
There are few things more important 
than voting on accession for Finland 
and Sweden to NATO. This accession 
process is an important chance for the 
United States to demonstrate leader-
ship in NATO and commitment to its 
modernization and, very importantly, 
NATO’s future. 
When 
the 
shooting 
is 
over 
in 
Ukraine, it won’t be over. There is no 
doubt that NATO is going to take a 
long, hard look at what it is doing, 
what its priorities are, and, very im-
portantly, hardening the eastern and 
northern flanks. 
Since this wave of NATO enlarge-
ment was first announced, the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee has care-
fully consulted and coordinated with 
our NATO allies, the governments of 
Sweden and Finland, with the adminis-
tration, and within the Senate itself to 
ensure this process can move as effi-
ciently and quickly as possible. I can’t 
count the number of meetings and con-
versations we have had in this regard. 
We now have only one step left until 
ratification, and it makes no sense to 
dillydally at this stage. There should 
be no issue with moving this treaty as 
quickly as possible. The Senate’s quick 
ratification of Finland and Sweden as 
new members of NATO will both send a 
strong message of transatlantic unity 
to a now foundering Russia and will 
strengthen 
NATO 
against 
Russia’s 
growing threat. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I 
rise today to discuss the CHIPS and 
Science Act, a bill approved by the 
Senate yesterday and, I am told, just 
approved literally in the last several 
minutes by the House of Representa-
tives, a bill that I am proud to be able 
to support, along with many of my col-
leagues. 
This bipartisan legislation will invest 
in our Nation’s semiconductor indus-
try, strengthen America’s manufac-
turing competitive edge over foreign 
competitors, and reduce supply chain 
burdens that exist with respect to our 
country and our people. Yesterday’s 
vote marked an important step in pro-
viding America the authority to set 
the rules of the road for a 21st-century 
economy. 
I was pleased to join so many of our 
colleagues in support of this bill so 
that States like Delaware and like Ne-
vada can continue to punch above our 
weight in the global economy for years 
to come. 
We probably all heard the saying be-
fore: ‘‘Today, they don’t make cars like 
they used to.’’ Well, some of my col-
leagues know and many folks in Dela-
ware know I can attest to that person-
ally. For two decades, I drove a 2001 
Chrysler Town and Country minivan, a 
silver one, affectionately called by 
many the Silver Bullet. It had 600,000 
miles on it. 
When I went to the DMV and took 
with me the young man who wanted to 
buy it, they asked me how much I was 
going to sell it for. 
I said: $1. 
The lady there at the desk at the 
DMV said: Well, what you have to do, 
you have to turn it over and sign on 
the back of title ‘‘$1.’’ 
So I wrote ‘‘$1,’’ and I signed the doc-
ument, as did the purchaser. 
Then the lady at the DMV said: 
There is a transfer fee you have to pay 
for the vehicle. 
I said: What is it? 
She said: 3 percent. 
I said: 3 percent of $1? 
She said: Yes. 
I pulled a nickel out of my pocket 
and gave it to her and said: Keep the 
change. 
But my old minivan is more popular 
and famous in my little State in a lot 
of places than I was. 
But anyway, that vehicle had seen 
every corner of the First State, with 
some 600,000 miles to her name. She 
carried ‘‘Carpertown’’ staffers, con-
stituents, family members, and even a 
future President—even a future Presi-
dent. 
When it came time to retire her early 
last summer, through anguish and 
heartache, I opted for a slight upgrade: 
a red Tesla Y that maybe someday will 
have 600,000 miles on it. We will see.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3769 
July 28, 2022 
Let me tell you, though, they don’t 
make cars like they used to. They 
make them a lot better, a whole lot 
better and a whole lot cleaner as well. 
On top of being fully electric—and let 
me just say that 2, 3, 4 years ago, our 
selection of electric vehicles, low-emis-
sion, no-emission vehicles, was limited, 
very limited, and folks from Tesla were 
largely outside of the gate. 
First, the people from GM had come 
up with a very good hybrid vehicle for 
a number of years, but it took a long 
time for us to actually get into the 
business—both domestic manufacturers 
and foreign manufacturers—of building 
and selling fully electric vehicles. 
But on top of being fully electric, 
right when you step into these new 
cars, including the one I own, you see a 
world of technology in front of us—a 
state-of-the-art touchscreen GPS sys-
tem, backup cameras, digital heating 
and air-conditioning controls. It is a 
far cry from my own minivan that 
drove so many miles. 
The odometer actually died on me at 
500,000 miles. I don’t know exactly how 
many miles it did have, but it had a 
lot. But at 500,000 miles, we went to 
Dover Downs, the Miracle Mile, the 
Monster Mile, where they do auto rac-
ing and NASCAR racing. They let me 
drive my minivan around the track as 
fast as it would go. Holding the starter 
flag out the window, I thought it was 
going to rip my arm off, but it didn’t. 
But it didn’t. 
One ride in a car like my new one, 
and it is clear, automotive technology 
and the American economy have dras-
tically advanced in the last 20 years. 
That is thanks, in part, to the advances 
of semiconductor technology or, as we 
sometimes say, chips. 
Now, folks at home might have read 
about chips or may have heard about 
some connection with semiconductors 
and our supply chain woes on the 
nightly news, but they still wonder 
what that has to do with their every-
day lives. So here it is, a little bit of 
chips 101, a little bit of chips 101 before 
I get in my new vehicle and head for 
the Delaware State Fair as fast as I 
can go—legally, legally. 
Chips 101: a semiconductor, often-
times referred to as a chip, is com-
monly used material in tech manufac-
turing made of elements like silicon 
that are valued for their ability to 
manage the flow of electricity. 
In our technology, a chip as small as 
a puzzle piece or even smaller than a 
fingernail is vital to creating the 
phones that we carry in our pockets or 
in our purses, the washing machine in 
our basements, the television in our 
family rooms, and, yes, all that tech-
nology in our new vehicles. 
But more than that, the semiconduc-
tors have a vital role to play in some of 
the medical equipment that monitors 
our health and in the weapons systems 
that protect our country. 
But after 2 years of the COVID–19 
pandemic and economic shock, unpre-
dictable shutdowns, along with labor 
shortages and logistic failures, have led 
to severe supply chain constraints. 
These supply chain issues have caused 
the same inflation that Americans 
have seen play out in empty shelves at 
your local grocery stores or in new 
technology that they have saved up for 
years to buy but are having a hard 
time finding on the market as of late. 
Just last month, Senator JOHN COR-
NYN and I chaired a Finance Trade Sub-
committee hearing, and it was a hear-
ing on supply chain resiliency. We did 
it in order to take a look at what is 
causing supply chain backlogs and 
hurting American consumers. 
We heard that day from the experts 
about the need for greater investments 
in semiconductor manufacturing here 
at home and about the vulnerabilities 
we face when companies thousands and 
thousands of miles away—maybe on 
the other side of the world—can deter-
mine the economic success of entire 
American industries. Because our man-
ufacturing sector relies on this tech-
nology, we are beholden to the compa-
nies that produce semiconductors and 
we are hamstrung—hamstrung—by the 
delays 
that 
slow 
these 
companies 
down. 
That is increasingly a problem when 
America’s share of global chips produc-
tion drops from 37 percent—37 per-
cent—in 1990 to just 12 percent today or 
when more than 75 percent of chips are 
manufactured in Asia on the other side 
of the world. This reliance on foreign 
manufacturers makes our economic 
and our national security vulnerable to 
geopolitical 
shocks 
from 
halfway 
around the planet. 
And that is a problem for companies 
in my State of Delaware and your 
State of Nevada, Madam President. But 
one of the companies that I would men-
tion from our State is Hologic, and 
they are located in Newark, DE, near 
the University of Delaware, the north-
ern part of our State. They rely on a 
reliable stream of chips to produce 
mammography machines. For Hologic, 
a shortage of chips means not just 
slower production of new mammog-
raphy machines but a struggle to re-
place and repair old machines that 
women across our country rely on for 
vital preventive care to detect breast 
cancer. 
After more than 2 years of this pan-
demic and cancer screenings all too 
often delayed for months, that means 
more clinics and doctors’ offices with 
outdated equipment will offer limited 
screenings, 
and 
that 
means 
more 
women in States like mine and like 
yours across America will have to put 
screenings that could save their lives 
on the back burner. 
That is just one very serious, real- 
world example of why these invest-
ments are critical to families and they 
are critical to businesses up and down 
the ‘‘First State’’ and across the 
United States. So, Madam President, 
we can and we should take action to 
address some of the weaknesses in our 
economy and to compete with coun-
tries like China in the process. 
That is why I am proud to support 
the CHIPS and Science Act. It is a 
much needed investment for the manu-
facturing of semiconductors and the 
development of other critical tech-
nologies in our country, and it will pro-
vide tax incentives to make our tech 
sector the envy of the world once 
again. 
By 
investing 
in 
American-made 
chips, we can reduce costs of tech-
nology for Americans, improve supply 
chain reliability, and we can create 
new opportunities and jobs for a lot of 
American workers. 
And by investing in the National 
Science Foundation and the American 
innovation hubs, we have an oppor-
tunity to jump-start American innova-
tion and growth once again. 
This legislation will make life a bit 
easier for businesses and consumers 
across America, from car dealerships in 
Delaware, on the east coast, and in 
your State of Nevada, out there in the 
middle of the great West—from car 
dealerships in Delaware that don’t 
have enough inventory to meet cus-
tomer 
demands 
to 
manufacturers 
struggling to access critical parts and 
inputs. 
As Secretary of Commerce Raimondo 
and the Defense Secretary have made 
clear over the last couple of weeks, in-
cluding in a briefing that they held 
with us, this bill will bolster both our 
economic and our national security— 
but not only that. To not act, to not 
invest in American jobs and manufac-
turing, as Secretary Raimondo de-
scribed it, would cause—her words— 
‘‘irreparable harm to the United States 
economy and the United States mili-
tary operations’’—because when Amer-
ica isn’t in the driver’s seat, someone 
else is taking the wheel, and Ameri-
cans may well fall behind as a result. 
So we have not just an opportunity, I 
think we have an obligation to Amer-
ican consumers and to our Nation’s 
workforce to invest right here at home. 
The action we are taking should be the 
beginning rather than the end of our 
efforts 
to 
strengthen, 
once 
again, 
American economic competitiveness. 
There were many bipartisan ideas on 
the table through the debate over this 
legislation, some ideas that didn’t 
make it into the final bill. Many of 
them are worthy of our future consid-
eration. And as the chairman of the Fi-
nance Subcommittee on International 
Trade that I lead with Senator CORNYN, 
I will continue advocating for greater 
economic engagement with our allies 
across the globe and especially—espe-
cially—in the Asia-Pacific. 
There is more we can do. I will say 
that again. There is more we can do— 
and must do—to strengthen supply 
chain resiliency, combat unfair trade 
practices, and support the American 
worker and innovation. 
I was proud to vote in favor of the 
CHIPS and Science Act because, first 
and foremost, I serve the people of the 
‘‘First State.’’ And yesterday’s vote 
will mean investments that create jobs

for 
Delaware 
workers 
and 
States 
around us. We have a lot of people in 
other States who work in Delaware 
even though they live in Pennsylvania 
or New Jersey or in Maryland. 
Yesterday’s vote will mean support 
for the technology that keeps our loved 
ones healthy and safe, and it will also 
mean more affordable goods, delivered 
faster, to families in the ‘‘First State’’ 
and every other State. 
I want to commend the House of Rep-
resentatives for the action that they 
took today in passing this legislation. 
And when I leave here today, I am 
going to go out and get in that red 
sports car that I drive these days. And 
it has incredible music, just incredible 
music, as you probably know. Most 
cars have that these days. And I think 
that, first, I am going to head for the 
Delaware State Fair, which I love. The 
first time I ran for office, that was sort 
of like where I announced it a million 
years ago. 
I will probably pick out some music 
to listen to, and the first song, I think, 
is a Willie Nelson song. It is a Willie 
Nelson song: ‘‘On the Road Again.’’ 
And I am going to get on the road 
again and head for the ‘‘First State,’’ 
for the Delaware State Fair, and look 
forward to meeting a lot of people. 
I wish you a great weekend. To my 
colleague DAN SULLIVAN from Alaska, 
the marine colonel who is about to 
take the floor, have at it. Danny, it is 
all yours. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to compliment my colleague from 
Delaware, whom I enjoy working with 
very much on the EPW Committee. 
Normally at this time, the end of the 
week, I talk about the Alaskan of the 
Week. So stay tuned for next week 
when we continue that series. It has 
been going on for 6 years. 
NEPA 
Madam President, today, actually, I 
want to talk about the Americans of 
the century, the Americans of the cen-
tury. This is an iconic, iconic picture 
of the men—and, of course, women— 
who built our great Nation: the work-
ing families, the union members who 
built our great Nation, won World War 
II. 
This is, by the way, the Empire State 
Building. Some of our workers built 
that. I want to talk about that here in 
a minute. They are having a little bit 
of lunch. But these are the workers 
who built America, certainly helped us 
win World War II: the machinists, elec-
tricians, welders, builders. 
And, Madam President, next week, 
my colleagues are going to be put to 
the test, and it is going to be a simple 
test. It is a question that is a really 
important one right now: Where do you 
stand? Do you stand with the working 
men and women of this great Nation, 
the ones who built our country and 
their incredible heritage of building 
America, or do you stand with the 
coastal elites—represented by this indi-
vidual—who are actually focused on 
not building the country but in many 
ways shutting it down? 
Well, I will tell you where I stand. I 
stand right here with the men and 
women who have built this great Na-
tion. 
Here is what is going to happen next 
week. I am bringing together a joint 
resolution of disapproval under the 
Congressional Review Act, what we 
call a CRA, that will be a simple vote 
to nullify a recent Biden administra-
tion regulation that clearly is going to 
make it harder in America to build in-
frastructure projects—to build build-
ings, to build energy projects. These 
regulations will waste taxpayer dol-
lars, but the biggest thing they will do 
is they will prevent workers from 
working and building the country. 
So that is it. We are going to have a 
simple vote on whether you stand with 
the people who take a shower before 
work or the people who take a shower 
after work, the people who spend their 
day holding tools to build things or 
holding lattes—the people with dirt 
under their fingernails. 
The vote will answer the question 
posed by the late folk singer Pete 
Seeger: Which side are you on? Now, 
right now, there are 50 Republican Sen-
ators who are on the side of the work-
ing men and women. They cosponsored 
my resolution. So let’s talk a little bit 
about the background of what we are 
going to vote on next week. 
This is a very famous structure in 
America, the Hoover Dam, and it is 
part of a great American tradition that 
we are all proud of—every single Amer-
ican—that we used to build big things: 
our roads, our dams, our ports, our 
bridges, our pipelines. We built engi-
neering marvels in the world, a source 
of immense pride for all Americans. 
The 
Hoover 
Dam—look 
at 
that—5 
years—actually, less than 5 years—to 
build that dam. The Empire State 
Building, you just saw a picture of men 
and women building that. It took 410 
days to build the Empire State Build-
ing. The Pentagon, the biggest office 
building in the world: 16 months. 
Let me talk a little bit closer to 
home. The 1,700-mile Alaska-Canada 
Highway, through some of the world’s 
most rugged terrain: 11 months. We did 
that. America did that. Workers did 
that. 
The 
Trans-Alaska 
Pipeline— 
think of this: 70,000 sections of 48-inch- 
wide pipe, joined and laid—70,000 sec-
tions—across three mountain ranges, 
800 riverbeds, tundra, forests, lakes, 
from the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific— 
800 miles—3 years. Incredible. 
The American worker can build any-
thing, can build anything. And then 
the engineering. We put a man on the 
Moon in less than 10 years. We used to 
do big things, big infrastructure. And 
the men and women of America have 
always been the best, most productive 
workers in the country. 
Well, that is no longer, unfortu-
nately, the legacy of America. And 
here is part of what is going to happen 
next week. Let me talk a little bit of a 
background issue here. And I know 
some of my colleagues aren’t going to 
like to hear it, but the Democratic 
Party was once home to these great 
American workers. That is true. 
My family was part of this tradi-
tion—Irish-Catholic 
immigrants, 
Democrats. 
My 
great-grandfather 
Frank J. Sullivan was one of the found-
ing members of the IBEW, Inter-
national 
Brotherhood 
of 
Electrical 
Workers. He passed on the values of 
hard work throughout his family. And 
the Democratic Party long supported 
the union members, the workers who 
built not just America but the middle 
class. And I think that is a proud tradi-
tion. I think that is a proud tradition— 
certainly something that my family 
was part of. But that has been aban-
doned. 
Right now, the focus is much more 
on coastal, progressive elites and what 
they want versus what these men and 
women want. That was yesterday’s 
Democratic Party. You are seeing 
headlines more like this: ‘‘The Demo-
crats’ Working Class Voter Problem.’’ 
That is a headline from the Democratic 
ally blog titled ‘‘The Liberal Patriot.’’ 
Newsweek: ‘‘Democrats Have Forgot-
ten the Working Class.’’ 
Here is a doozy from the Economist 
recently: Democrats in America are re-
alizing they must moderate or die. 
Now, some attribute this problem to 
cultural issues. As James Carville said 
‘‘Wokeness is a problem.’’ 
Cultural issues, wokeness, and all 
that implies are certainly issues driv-
ing the working class away from the 
Democratic Party. But I believe the 
problems that the Democrats are hav-
ing with the working class run much 
deeper than wokeness. I believe they 
are structural. And at the end of the 
day, they are pocketbook issues. One 
issue that impacts everybody, but espe-
cially America’s workers, is the regu-
latory system—the permitting system 
that we have in America. 
It hurt so much of our country. But 
I will tell you who it really hurts: the 
men and women who build things. They 
are on the ground. They see their 
projects being delayed when they are 
killed. They are the ones who get the 
pink slips when there is endless litiga-
tion on a resource development project 
in Alaska. They are the ones worrying 
about feeding their families because 
they don’t have good work because 
they can’t build things anymore. They 
are the ones who are attacked by the 
far left because they produce things 
like American energy, which we all 
need. 
We live in a nation now that is in-
creasingly divided into two countries: 
one of builders and doers, of working 
men and women, of working families, 
and the other side that soaks up the 
spoils of those workers and then fig-
ures out ways to make their job even 
harder, oftentimes resulting in putting 
them out of work altogether. 
And I have seen this time and time 
again in my State—in my State. When

these men and women try to build 
things—and there is a choice with my 
Democratic colleagues between the 
coastal elites who want to shut things 
down and the men and women in Amer-
ica who want to build things—unfortu-
nately, the default position for them is 
the coastal elites, forsaking the work-
ing men and women of our country. 
So why am I so animated by this? It 
is because our great Nation that built 
so many great things is now caught up 
in redtape. It is now caught up in red-
tape. So I want to talk a little bit more 
about my resolution and the vote we 
are going to have next Wednesday, or 
next Tuesday. The National Environ-
mental Policy Act was a good idea 
when it passed in late 1969. It required 
environmental 
impact 
statements 
when things were being built so the 
public could be engaged. 
That act, called NEPA, resulted in 
people participating in the permitting 
process but not overburdening it. So 
normally, a NEPA Environmental Im-
pact Statement—an EIS—at the begin-
ning, when it was first passed, would 
take less than a year, a couple hundred 
pages. That was it. 
Now you look at the system in Amer-
ica. To try to build things, the average 
EIS takes 4 to 6 years to just com-
plete—4 to 6 years to just complete. 
And it usually costs several million 
dollars just to build anything in this 
country. That wasn’t the purpose of 
NEPA. We are killing ourselves as a 
nation with our inability to build in-
frastructure because we are tangled up 
in redtape. 
In his recent reporting, the progres-
sive New York Times writer Ezra Klein 
looks at the cost of building things in 
America relative to other industri-
alized countries. Klein writes that 
Japan, Canada, and Germany build a 
kilometer of rail for $170 million, $254 
million, and $287 million, respectively. 
That seems like a lot, until you get to 
the United States. One kilometer costs 
$538 million, way more than any other 
industrialized 
country. 
Delays 
are 
costs. Of course, we know that. 
According to the GAO—and this is a 
study several years ago; I am sure it is 
much worse—a new U.S. highway con-
struction project, just to build a high-
way normally takes 9 to 19 years. 
Come on, America. We built the 
Alcan Highway, 1,100 miles, in 11 
months. 
This is a topic that I am very pas-
sionate about. It sounds kind of geeky. 
Permitting, rules, regulations—it is 
the core of our economy, and it is the 
core of what is keeping so many work-
ing families down. 
Let me give you a couple of other ex-
amples. The new—not new now—re-
cently expanded runway at the Seattle- 
Tacoma Airport took about 3 years to 
build. We had a hearing on the Com-
merce Committee. I asked the head of 
the Sea-Tac Airport, ‘‘How long did it 
take you to get the permits before you 
could build that?’’ New runway, Sea- 
Tac needs it. He looked at me, and he 
said ‘‘Senator, 15 years.’’ 
Fifteen years to get permits to do a 
runway expansion at Sea-Tac Airport. 
He actually said: 
By the time we got the permits and the 
construction time, almost 20 years. I think 
that the ancient Egyptians would have built 
the pyramids by then. 
This is what we are talking about. 
Every State, every city, every commu-
nity sees this problem. 
Let me give you a couple of other ex-
amples. The Gross Reservoir in Colo-
rado, which is going to offer clean 
water to all the people of Colorado, has 
taken two decades—20 years—to get 
this project permitted. California’s bul-
let train that they are still working 
on—approved in the late 1990s—is still 
not built because of permitting delays. 
The costs have gone from $33 billion to 
$105 billion. 
The Mountain Valley Pipeline in Vir-
ginia and West Virginia, trying to 
transport natural gas—litigation is 
stopping that. 
Of course, in Alaska, we are ground 
zero for a lot of this. The Kensington 
Mine right now is producing gold for 
our country. Hundreds of people are 
working there. The average wage is 
$110,000. Those are good jobs. Twenty 
years to permit that line, if you in-
clude the litigation—20 years. 
Here is how James Callahan, great 
American worker, president of the 
International Union of Operating Engi-
neers—the men and women who really 
build America, the operating engi-
neers—put it in a letter supporting my 
resolution next week. You can see it 
right here. He nails it: 
Since its modest beginnings, NEPA has 
evolved into a massive edifice, capable of de-
stroying project after project— 
Destroying, not helping— 
job after job, in virtually every sector of the 
economy. 
He goes on: 
Dilatory strategies employed by project 
opponents frequently exploit provisions in 
NEPA, weighing down projects, frustrating 
communities, and raising costs to the point 
that many applicants, whether public or pri-
vate, simply walk away. 
By the way, when I talk about the 
coastal 
elites—the 
radical 
environ-
mental groups—that is their goal, to 
use NEPA to just kill projects. And 
they are really, really good at that. 
So what happens, as James Callahan 
says—when that happens, when the ap-
plicants simply walk away—well, we 
know what happens. Work dries up. 
Layoffs happen. The dignity of work 
and hope that can lift entire commu-
nities dissipates. Families struggle. 
Communities struggle. 
When we talk about good-paying jobs 
in our country, we are talking about so 
much more than men and women 
punching a clock. We are talking about 
the health of families, the pride in 
communities, the pride in our country. 
Look at the pride of those men and 
women who built the Empire State 
Building, the pride of men and women 
who built the Alaska pipeline. We see 
it over and over again that commu-
nities without hope, without an eco-
nomic 
future, 
without 
good-paying 
jobs, who get crushed by these burden-
some regulations and groups that want 
to shut them down, are much more 
prone to experiencing violence, crime, 
succumbing to kinds of huge challenges 
like the opioid crisis. 
And so these issues matter across the 
country. But, again, they matter to 
working families more than anyone. 
So what are we going to do next 
week? Well, a surprise to me—and I 
must admit, it was a surprise; I came 
down here and talked about this a 
while ago—was that during the nego-
tiations for the infrastructure bill that 
many of us voted on—I voted for it last 
year, in part because it had really good 
provisions—not as good as I would have 
wanted—but 
on 
permitting 
reform. 
These built on what I worked on with 
the Trump administration when they 
put out regulations as it related to 
building infrastructure that, by the 
way, was supported by millions and 
millions of Americans for the reasons I 
just talked about: streamlining permit-
ting, getting projects online, not so 
costly. 
So some of the NEPA reforms that 
we got in the infrastructure bill were 
things that we had built on during the 
Trump administration. Let me give 
you a couple of examples: one Federal 
agency in charge of all regulatory deci-
sions, timelines on NEPA, limitations 
on the pages required by NEPA. These 
were commonsense reforms that we 
worked on with the Trump administra-
tion and some of which we got into the 
infrastructure bill. 
So imagine, this is supposedly Joe 
Biden’s top legislative achievement—4 
months ago, kind of under the radar, 
the White House, the Biden White 
House—counts on environmental qual-
ity—put out new regulations. 
And here is the Wall Street Journal’s 
editorial on what these new regula-
tions were meant to do. And anyone 
who has read them—and I encourage 
all Americans to read them—these reg-
ulations have one goal in mind: slowing 
down the ability to build American in-
frastructure, especially American en-
ergy infrastructure. 
The new NEPA regulations from the 
Biden White House make it harder to 
build our country, when the President 
supposedly supported the infrastruc-
ture bill. I truly wonder if the Presi-
dent has any clue that his White House 
issued regs to undermine what we all 
viewed as a very important bipartisan 
achievement. 
Now, I gave a speech a couple of 
weeks ago saying: How did this hap-
pen? How are we killing infrastructure 
on the sly through these regulations 
when, supposedly, this administration 
wants to build infrastructure, wants to 
support the working men and women of 
our country? 
My view is like a lot of things. John 
Kerry, Gina McCarthy were probably 
behind it, but who the heck knows. But 
here is what I do know. The only peo-
ple who like these rules—the rules that

are meant to slow down the building of 
American infrastructure—are certainly 
not the working men and women of 
America; it is the radical environ-
mental groups, probably the trial law-
yers. And I will give you another group 
that loves it when we do this to our-
selves: the Chinese Communist Party. 
They look at us and go: Holy cow, 
these Americans can’t get out of their 
own way. Nine years to permit a 
bridge. This is killing us in terms of 
competitiveness. Mayors don’t like 
these rules. 
So what we are going to do next 
week, my Congressional Review Act 
resolution is very simple. It says, we 
are going to rescind this Biden rule 
that is going to make it harder to build 
American infrastructure. 
And here is the thing: Right now, we 
have a very big list of groups that are 
supporting my resolution. We got all 
the building trades of America; the op-
erating engineers; the AFL–CIO of 
Alaska; the Laborers’ International, 
LIUNA—the 
biggest 
construction 
union 
in 
America; 
and 
so 
many 
groups—farmers, independent business 
men and women. Dozens of groups are 
supporting our resolution to say we are 
not going to allow that. We want to 
build things. We want to build things. 
President Biden likes to talk about 
his supposed blue collar roots. Well, I 
wonder where the President is going to 
be on my resolution because all the 
unions in America that build stuff are 
supporting it. Again, maybe he didn’t 
even know his White House put it out 
there. Maybe he wants to support my 
Congressional Review Act resolution. 
But I will tell you who this resolu-
tion is going to be really good for. It is 
going to be good for these men and 
women in America who built this coun-
try, who built this country. 
I will end where I began. Next week, 
there is going to be a big vote here, a 
simple vote. I have 50 Republicans who 
cosponsored my resolution to get rid of 
the Biden administration regulation 
that is going to kill infrastructure. If 
you support the building trades and the 
labor unions who built America, you 
are going to vote yes on my resolution. 
If you support infrastructure for Amer-
ica and building it in a timely fashion, 
you are going to vote yes on my resolu-
tion. If you support American energy 
that we need so much in our country, 
that we have right here, that we don’t 
need to import from Saudi Arabia or 
Russia or Iran or Venezuela, you are 
going to support my resolution. If you 
support the men and women who actu-
ally build this country, all of whom 
who are supporting my resolution, you 
are going to support my resolution. 
But if you stand with the coastal en-
vironmental elites who want to shut 
down this country, shut down my 
State, shut down the economy, maybe 
you will vote the other way. Like I said 
in the beginning, it is going to be a test 
next week. Whose side are you on? Are 
you with these men and women and 
their heritage and their heroism who 
built this country, or are you going to 
be standing with this individual, the 
epitome 
of 
arrogant 
coastal 
elite, 
smugly telling Americans that they 
shouldn’t build energy projects? 
I know where I am standing next 
week. I am standing with the great 
men and women who built this coun-
try, the great men and women who 
continue to build this country, the 
great men and women who are sup-
porting my resolution. And I sure hope 
all my colleagues vote the same way. 
This is an easy vote for America. This 
should be 100 to 0. That is the reason 
why. 
I yield the floor.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, it 
has been a momentous 24 hours here in 
the Congress. 
A legislative one-two punch that the 
American people rarely see. A little 
while ago, the House voted to approve 
the largest investment in decades to 
lower costs, increase manufacturing, 
invest in science, and help fix the semi-
conductor 
crisis. 
The 
CHIPS 
and 
Science bill now goes to the President’s 
desk after 3 long years. 
And, last night, Senator MANCHIN and 
I announced an agreement on the Infla-
tion Reduction Act of 2022, a bill that 
will take historic steps to lower costs, 
fight 
climate 
change, 
and 
make 
healthcare more affordable in this 
country. 
Again, the past 24 hours have been a 
legislative one-two punch that Ameri-
cans rarely ever see and which will 
benefit them immensely: first, a bill 
that will supercharge the American in-
dustry and now a bill that will fight in-
flation and mark a turning point in our 
fight against climate change. 
This morning, I met with my Demo-
cratic colleagues to review the big wins 
contained in the Inflation Reduction 
Act of 2022, and we discussed our plan 
for passing it through reconciliation 
next week. 
With the Inflation Reduction Act of 
2022, this Senate majority will finally 
take on Big Pharma and lower pre-
scription drug prices. 
This Senate Democratic majority 
will tackle the climate crisis with the 
largest package on the climate ever. 
This Senate majority will ensure we 
close tax loopholes and make the 
wealthy corporations and individuals 
pay their fair share, and this Senate 
Democratic majority will fight infla-
tion and reduce the deficit. 
The Inflation Reduction Act is com-
mon sense; it is bold; and it is very 
much needed. For decades, many in 
Washington have promised to address 
these challenges. But where previous 
efforts have fallen short, Senate Demo-
crats in this majority will move swiftly 
to deliver to the American people. 
Now, there is so much to like in the 
Inflation Reduction Act. By a wide 
margin, this legislation will be the 
largest action on climate change ever 
passed by the Congress. 
Like the creation of the EPA and the 
passage of the Clean Air Act half a cen-
tury ago, this legislation will mark a 
turning point in our Nation’s commit-
ment to protect our planet for our chil-
dren and our grandchildren. 
Through this bill, we will at last put 
the United States on a path to roughly 
40 percent emission reductions by 2030. 
And it will help us achieve climate jus-
tice for communities long left behind, 
especially communities of color. But 
that is not all, for many years, people 
in 
Washington—including 
President 
Trump, including the Republican Sen-
ate—promised to lower the cost of pre-
scription drugs, but they failed to fol-
low through. 
Under this Senate Democratic major-
ity, that is changing. Our proposal will 
finally lower the cost of prescription 
drugs by empowering Medicare—for the 
first time ever—to negotiate the prices 
of certain drugs in Part B and Part D. 
We will prevent healthcare premiums 
from 
skyrocketing 
for 
millions 
of 
Americans in the coming months. And 
through it all, we will ensure that no 
small business or family making under 
$400,000 a year will see their taxes go 
up. 
Republicans go on and on and on 
about how this is a tax on the Amer-
ican people. No, Republicans, you try 
to hide the truth. The truth is this bill 
will close tax loopholes exploited by 
the wealthiest Americans and largest 
corporations and will not touch Ameri-
cans who make below $400,000 a year. 
Why don’t you say that? Because you 
know your tax policies are so unpopu-
lar with the American people, which we 
proved in 2017. You tried the same shib-
boleth then. Oh, we are cutting taxes 
for the American people. We Demo-
crats make clear to the American peo-
ple, no, no, no, they were cutting taxes 
on the very wealthy. And by the time 
the 2018 campaigns rolled around, they 
didn’t even mention it. We are going to 
do the same thing now. We are going to 
tell the truth. 
Yes, we are raising taxes on very 
wealthy people and big corporations 
that pay no money, not on average 
Americans, and you are afraid to do 
that. 
The American people want these tax 
reforms. They support making sure the 
ultrarich and big corporations play by 
the rules and pay their fair share. It is 
common sense. The American people 
know that. 
So when Republicans fret and panic 
about taxes, the truth is what they 
really hate is the idea of increasing 
taxes on Big Business and those at the 
very top. 
And they are afraid to admit to the 
American people that they know they 
are on the wrong side of the issue. As I 
said, Republicans should have learned 
their lesson in 2018 when the American 
people rejected their tax cuts for rich 
Americans. 
We all saw what the results are, what 
happens when Republicans cut taxes 
for the ultrarich and corporations: It

fuels hundreds of billions in corporate 
stock buybacks, and since then, stock 
buybacks have only increased. 
According to S&P, buybacks are fore-
cast to reach a trillion dollars this 
year. The American people don’t want 
a tax code that is skewed to the top 1 
percent, which is what happened under 
Republicans, under President Trump 
when they had the majority. 
Republicans really know that, so 
they, in fear—they distract and distort 
and ignore the fact that under our 
plan, small business and middle-class 
families making under 400,000 won’t see 
their taxes go up at all. 
It is the same thing for the deficit. 
For years, Republicans have howled at 
the Moon about lowering the Federal 
deficit, but when they were in the ma-
jority, they blew a $2 trillion hole in 
our deficit in order to pay for their gar-
gantuan tax cuts to big corporations 
and the ultrarich. 
The Democrats’ proposal will actu-
ally lower the deficit significantly, 
which will go a long way to easing in-
flation. 
If Republicans really care about 
fighting inflation, if they really care 
about lowering the deficit as they 
claimed, they should support our pro-
posal, which would lower the deficit by 
hundreds of billions of dollars. 
Now, at the end of the day, the Amer-
ican people want us to do a few com-
monsense things: Lower the cost of 
their daily expenses like healthcare, 
protect our planet for future genera-
tions, make sure everyone plays by the 
same rules and has a fair shot at 
achieving the American dream, and 
that is what the Inflation Reduction 
Act will do. 
These are not easy matters, but we 
didn’t come here to do easy things. To 
be sure, the work is not done. There is 
a lot we have to do in the coming days, 
but I am proud that right now we have 
a strong, bold package to move on, one 
that will lower inflation, fight the cli-
mate crisis, and help preserve Amer-
ica’s place as a nation of immense op-
portunity into the 21st century. 
Let us get to work and pass the Infla-
tion Reduction Act of 2022.

THE BALTICS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today is a very important date for the 
relations between the United States 
and the Baltic states of Estonia, Lat-
via, and Lithuania. 
Today marks 100 years of continuous, 
uninterrupted diplomatic relations be-
tween our country and each of the Bal-
tic countries. 
Let me explain why I emphasize con-
tinuous, uninterrupted diplomatic rela-
tions. Last Saturday marked 82 years 
since Acting Secretary of State Sum-
ner Welles issued a declaration that is 
remembered to this day in each of the 
Baltic countries. Soviet troops had en-
tered the Baltic states, arrested lead-
ers, and organized rigged elections to 
create pro-Soviet government. 
The Welles Declaration decried the 
‘‘devious processes whereunder the po-
litical independence and territorial in-
tegrity of the three small Baltic Re-
publics—Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania—were to be deliberately annihi-
lated by one of their more powerful 
neighbors.’’ It was a clear, principled 
statement 
that 
the 
United 
States 
would not recognize Soviet control 
over these countries as legitimate. 
During the 50 years the Soviet Union 
forcibly occupied Estonia, Latvia, and 
Lithuania, diplomats from each of the 
Baltic states continued their work in 
the United States, and we continued to 
recognize them as independent, sov-
ereign countries under foreign occupa-
tion. 
The Soviet Union justified sending 
troops to the Baltics on the basis of the 
threat from Nazi Germany. However, 
just a year before, the Molotov-Ribben-
trop Pact between the Nazis and Sovi-
ets contained a secret protocol where-
by Hitler and Stalin agreed to carve up 
their neighbors into ‘‘spheres of influ-
ence.’’ Under this agreement, the Bal-
tics, Finland, eastern Poland, and what 
is now Moldova would be controlled by 
the Soviet Union, and the rest of Po-
land would go to Germany. Finland 
was able to fight back in the Winter 
War, retaining its sovereignty, but los-
ing significant territory to Russia. The 
rest of the pact played out just as Sta-
lin and Hitler agreed. 
This isn’t just history. This is di-
rectly relevant to Vladimir Putin’s 
rhetoric, 
attitude, 
and 
actions 
in 
Ukraine. He believes he has a right to 
a sphere of influence over his neighbors 
just like Stalin and Hitler thought. To 
this day, Putin maintains that the 
three Baltics joined the Soviet Union 
in 1940 and ceased to exist as countries 
until the breakup of the Soviet Union 
in 1991. The Russian Duma has even 
threatened to repeal a Soviet law rec-
ognizing 
Lithuania’s 
independence 
from the USSR—what a joke. 
Let’s be clear: The Baltic states are 
not former Soviet republics. They have 
been independent countries for over a 
century. Following in Stalin’s foot-
steps, 
Putin 
justifies 
attacking 
Ukraine, at least to audiences outside 
of Russia, as a reaction to NATO en-
croaching on Russia. Putin casts NATO 
as a threat, even making up a claim 
that NATO was planning to put mis-
siles in Ukraine targeting Russia. 
The fact is, even our eastern flank al-
lies in NATO do not currently have the 
kinds of defensive missiles they would 
need to repel a Russian invasion, which 
is unfortunate. Currently, we have 
meager ‘‘tripwire’’ forces that are in-
sufficient to stop the kind of invasion 
we saw in Ukraine in February. Rus-
sia’s military leaders know that NATO 
cannot begin to threaten Russian terri-
tory. 
There were no allied reinforcements 
in any NATO country bordering Russia 
until the invasion of Ukraine in 2014. 
Ukraine was militarily neutral then, 
but seeking economic ties with the Eu-
ropean Union, thus slipping away from 
economic dependency on Russia. 
The fact that NATO has become at-
tractive to Ukraine since Russia seized 
Crimea and part of the Donbas is a 
threat not to the territory of the Rus-
sian Federation, but to Russia’s impe-
rial desire for a sphere of influence. 
Putin blames Ukraine’s westward turn 
on 
provocations 
by 
western 
intel-
ligence agencies, failing to recognize 
that Ukrainians are making their own 
choices. Just like in 1940, the United 
States has refused to recognize another 
Russian occupation of a sovereign 
country as legitimate. 
We were once a small collection of 
colonies seeking to chart our own, 
independent course free from European 
empires. That is why the Welles Dec-
laration expressed admiration for the 
Baltic countries as they pursued self- 
government and democracy. 
That is why the Welles Declaration 
made clear that the people of the 
United States oppose intervention or 
the use of force by large or powerful 
countries on smaller, weaker ones. 
That 
principle 
applies 
today 
to 
Ukraine. 
No 
one 
should 
decide 
Ukraine’s fate except the Ukrainian 
people. True to our principles, the 
United States can never, directly or 
tacitly, consign Ukraine to Russia’s 
sphere of influence. 
As we celebrate 100 years of excellent 
diplomatic relations with our Baltic al-
lies, there is no doubt in retrospect 
that we were right to stand up for their 
sovereignty, even when that seemed 
hopeless, even foolish. Fifty years of 
Russian occupation could not turn 
them into Russians, just as centuries 
of Russification policies have not con-
vinced Ukrainians to accept the Rus-
sian view that they are just ‘‘little 
Russians.’’ The Baltic countries are 
thriving democracies with strong West-
ern values and some of our closest al-
lies. Thank God they regained their 
independence and are now in NATO.

WATER RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT 
Mr. RISCH. Madam President, I rise 
today to convey my support for the Co-
lumbia River Federal Power System. 
The 
congressionally-authorized 
Fed-
eral dams on the Columbia River Sys-
tem bring unparalleled benefits to the 
Pacific Northwest and stand as an ex-
ample to other hydropower projects 
worldwide. The system’s capacity to 
generate always-on, baseload carbon- 
free power is vital to the Northwest. As 
many other parts of the country have 
experienced 
rolling 
blackouts, 
the 
dams in the Columbia Basin have con-
sistently kept the lights on. 
In the Northwest, we enjoy numerous 
other benefits from this infrastructure, 
including 
flood 
control, 
irrigation, 
navigation, and recreation. Due to its 
remarkable lock and dam system, even 
my landlocked home State of Idaho 
benefits from a seaport, sending Ida-
ho’s agricultural and manufactured 
products around the world in a cost-ef-
fective, low-carbon manner. As addi-
tional challenges have risen, scientists 
and managers at the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers have adapted under the di-
rection of Congress to ensure the dams 
are still simultaneously beneficial to 
humans and our natural environment. 
It is due to these important consider-
ations that I speak on the Water Re-
sources Development Act before the 
Senate today. Among a list of studies 
that can generally be measured in 
acres or at most counties is a sweeping 
and far-reaching study directed at 
aquatic habitat restoration in the Co-
lumbia River Basin. The Columbia 
River Basin spans nearly 260,000 square 
miles over seven States. This is not 
just another small, localized review, 
but instead authorizes an exhaustive 
study on aquatic restoration in one of 
the largest basins in the country. 
I have long supported improving 
salmon and steelhead populations in 
the Northwest. In fact, I worked tire-
lessly with colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to pass legislation—ulti-
mately supported by the entire North-
west delegation—to address the preda-
tion that was devastating salmon popu-
lations before they had a chance to go 
upriver. However, what I cannot sup-
port are the constant efforts to remove 
the benefits provided by our hydro-
power system under the guise of salm-
on recovery or ‘‘aquatic restoration.’’ 
We have studied this river and these 
dams ad nauseam. Most recently, the 
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers com-
pleted the 3-year Columbia River Sys-
tem Operations review, which inten-
tionally and specifically considered 
whether dam breaching was necessary 
for fish recovery and determined the 
opposite. It has been proven, time and 
again, salmon and hydropower dams 
do, can, and should coexist. It is futile 
and irresponsible to spend further tax-
payer dollars considering dam breach-
ing. But this reality has not prevented 
the administration or other political 
actors 
from 
continually 
pushing 
against the intent of Congress to pro-
tect both the species and the numerous 
benefits from the Columbia River Fed-
eral Power System. 
With this in mind, let us revisit the 
ecosystem study in title II. I deeply ap-
preciate the chairman and ranking 
member’s attention to this issue and 
work to create suitable limitations to 
ensure this study will be held strictly 
to the congressionally authorized pur-
poses of the system and considerations 
that would maintain the energy, flood 
control, navigation, irrigation, and 
other benefits it currently provides. 
While I still regard this study as too 
far-reaching and unfocused to result in 
timely proposals for anadromous fish 
recovery—yet again wasting taxpayer 
dollars better utilized elsewhere in the 
region—with this vital check, I am able 
to support this version of WRDA over-
all and the many essential water infra-
structure priorities contained within 
it. Should this proposed study be 
signed into law, I will take special no-
tice and trust that it meets congres-
sional intent of preserving the Colum-
bia River Federal Power System, all of 
its current infrastructure as authorized 
by Congress, and its innumerable bene-
fits. 
Despite political maneuvering from 
the administration, it is an irrefutable 
fact that decisions regarding the Co-
lumbia River Federal Power System 
are solely the responsibility of Con-
gress. I look forward to continue work-
ing with my colleagues to identify so-
lutions to salmon recovery that do not 
inhibit the clean energy, flood control, 
navigation, agricultural, and recre-
ation benefits of our Federal Power 
System.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Japan—AIM–120C–7/8 Advanced Medium- 
Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) 
The Government of Japan has requested to 
buy one hundred fifty (150) AIM–120C–7/C–8 
Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missiles 
(AMRAAMs); 
and 
three 
(3) 
AIM–120 
AMRAAM Guidance Sections. Also included 
are AIM–120 missile containers and control 
sections; weapon support and support equip-
ment; classified software delivery and sup-
port; spare and repair parts, consumables, 
and accessories; classified publications and 
technical documentation; U.S. Government 
and contractor engineering, technical and 
logistical support services; and other related 
elements of logistical and program support. 
The estimated total program cost is $293 mil-
lion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a major ally that is a force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in the 
Asia-Pacific region. 
The proposed sale will improve Japan’s ca-
pability to meet current and future threats 
by defending the Japanese homeland and 
U.S. personnel stationed there. Japan al-
ready has AMRAAMs in its inventory and 
will have no difficulty absorbing these mis-
siles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Raytheon 
Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Japan. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–40 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AIM–120C–7/C–8 Advanced Medium 
Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) is a su-
personic, air launched, aerial intercept, guid-
ed missile featuring digital technology and 
micro-miniature solid-state electronics. This 
potential sale will include AMRAAM Guid-
ance Section. AMRAAM capabilities include 
look-down/shoot-down, 
multiple 
launches 
against multiple targets, resistance to elec-
tronic countermeasures, and interception of 
high and low-flying and maneuvering tar-
gets. The AIM–120C–8 is a form, fit, and func-
tion refresh of the AIM–120C–7 and is the 
next generation to be produced. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Japan can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-

tenance; medical and other exercise- and 
training-related services and support; per-
sonnel clothing and equipment; facilities and 
construction support; and U.S. Government 
and contractor engineering, technical, main-
tenance, and logistics support services, as 
well as other related elements of logistical 
and program support. The total estimated 
program cost is $630 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by improving the security 
of a strategic partner that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in Asia. 
The proposed sale will enable the Singa-
pore Air Force to continue its flight training 
program to develop mission-ready and expe-
rienced pilots to safely and effectively fly its 
F–15 aircraft, as part of the Peace Carvin V 
Detachment Training Program. The well-es-
tablished pilot proficiency training program 
at Mountain Home Air Force Base will sup-
port professional interaction and enhance 
operational 
interoperability 
with 
U.S. 
Forces. Singapore will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing this equipment and support into its 
armed forces. 
This proposed sale will not alter the basic 
military balance in the region. 
There is no prime contractor involved in 
this proposed sale. Manpower support will be 
determined through competition with de-
fense articles anticipated to come from U.S. 
inventory, as needed. Sources of supply may 
award contracts when necessary to provide 
the defense articles if items are not available 
from U.S. inventory or are considered long 
lead-time away. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in connection with this 
sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Singapore. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–37 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Paveway II (PWII) is a maneuver-
able, free-fall Laser Guided Bomb (LGB) that 
guides to a spot of laser energy reflected off 
the target. The LGB is delivered like a nor-
mal General Purpose (GP) warhead and the 
semi-active guidance corrects for many of 
the normal errors inherent in any delivery 
system. Laser designation can be provided by 
a variety of laser target markers or designa-
tors. A LGB consists of a non-warhead spe-
cific MAU–209 or MAU–169 Computer Control 
Group (CCG) and a warhead specific Air Foil 
Group (AFG) that attaches to the nose and 
tail of the GP bomb body respectively. 
a. The GBU–12 is a 500LB GP bomb body 
fitted with the MXU–650 AFG to guide to its 
laser designated target. 
b. The GBU–10 is a 2000LB GP bomb body 
fitted with the MXU–651 AFG to guide to its 
laser designated target. The inert GBU–12 
uses a BDU–50 inert bomb body and MAU–169 
CCG for training purposes. 
2. The Joint Direct Attack Munitions 
(JDAM) is a guidance set which converts 
unguided bombs into an accurate, adverse 
weather ‘‘smart’’ munition. The Guidance 
Set consists of a Tail Kit, which contains the 
Inertial Navigation System (INS) and a 
Global Positioning System (GPS), a set of 
Aerosurfaces and an umbilical cover, which 
allows the JDAM to improve the accuracy of 
unguided, general purpose bombs. The JDAM 
weapon can be delivered from modest stand-
off ranges at high or low altitudes against a 
variety of land and surface targets during 
the day or night. The JDAM is capable of re-
ceiving target coordinates via preplanned 
mission data from the delivery aircraft, by 
onboard aircraft sensors (i.e., FLIR, Radar, 
etc.) during captive carry, or from a third- 
party source via manual or automated air-
crew cockpit entry. The Guidance Set, when 
combined with a warhead and appropriate 
fuze, forms a JDAM Guided Bomb Unit 
(GBU). 
a. The GBU–38 is a 500LB bomb body fitted 
with a KMU–572 guidance kit. 
b. The GBU–31 is a 2000LB bomb body fitted 
with a KMU–556 guidance kit. 
3. The Laser Joint Direct Attack Munition 
(LJDAM) is a JDAM that incorporates all 
the capabilities of the JDAM guidance tail 
kit and adds a precision laser guidance set 
(DSU–38 or DSU–40). The LJDAM gives the 
weapon system an optional semi-active laser 
guidance in addition to the INS/GPS guid-
ance. This provides the optional capability 
to strike moving targets. The GBU–54 is a 
500LB bomb body fitted with a laser guidance 
set and KMU–572 guidance kit. 
4. The KGV–135A is a high-speed, general 
purpose encryptor/decryptor module used for 
wide-band data encryption. 
5. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
6. I. a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
7. A determination has been made that 
Singapore can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This sale is necessary in further-
ance of the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification. 
8. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of 
Singapore.

value remained $1.91 billion. 
This transmittal reports the inclusion of 
an additional two (2) GPNTS (MDE). The es-
timated total value of the new MDE items is 
$3.1 million, resulting in a new MDE total of 
$1.221 billion. These costs will not increase 
the total case value, which will remain $1.91 
billion. 
(iv) Significance: The inclusion of the addi-
tional GPNTS will provide the Republic of 
Korea Navy (ROKN) the ability to properly 
employ their Aegis Shipboard Combat Sys-
tems. By acquiring these upgraded capabili-
ties, Korea can successfully perform mis-
sions with its destroyers and will provide 
greater protection for its forces. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy goals and national 
security objectives of the United States by 
improving the security of a major ally that 
is a force for political stability and economic 
progress in the Indo-Pacific region. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology statement contained in 
the original notification, as amended, ap-
plies to items reported here. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is UNCLASSI-

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO OFFICER JAMES ASH-
LEY, OFFICER CLAYTON KELLY, 
AND OFFICER CONNOR MALONEY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, on 
Thursday, May 12, 2021, three Louis-
ville Metro Police Department Officers 
bravely saved the lives of two citizens 
from their burning vehicles. 
After another driver collided with a 
pulled-over 
vehicle, 
Officers 
James 
Ashley, Clayton Kelly, and Connor 
Maloney quickly responded to the 
scene. The circumstances in which 
these officers arrived were less than 
ideal. Both drivers were unresponsive 
in vehicles moments from being en-
gulfed in flames on a dangerous and 
busy interstate. In addition, these rel-
atively new officers had never been 
trained to extract people from burning 
vehicles. But without hesitation, these 
brave officers quickly jumped into ac-
tion. 
Officers Kelly and Maloney used a 
baton to bust out a window and pulled 
one of the drivers to safety. Officer 
Ashley did the same and communicated 
with the other driver allowing him to 
crawl from his burning vehicle. 
Seventh Division Lieutenant Jeff 
Lauder stated, ‘‘These people would 
not have survived had it not been for 
the quick decision making and bravery 
of these officers.’’ The actions of these 
three officers directly saved the lives 
of two citizens in an extremely dan-
gerous situation. 
Officers Ashley, Kelly, and Maloney 
are brave servants to the city of Louis-
ville and a true testament to the hard- 
working Louisville Metro Police De-
partment. I am proud to salute these 
officers and have no doubt they will 
continue to be an incredible asset to 
citizens of Louisville.∑

RECOGNIZING BUBBY’S BBQ 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, each week I recognize an 
outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize Bubby’s BBQ of 
Corbin, KY, as the Senate Small Busi-
ness of the Week. 
For as long as he can remember, 
Marcus ‘‘Bubby’’ Shepherd loved to 
cook. He appreciated how food could 
bring people together and create a 
sense of comfort for everyone at the 
table. After working as a truck driver 
for 15 years, Marcus decided to switch 
career paths and open a restaurant 
that showcased his specialty: cooking 
and smoking meat. Hence, Bubby’s 
BBQ of Corbin, KY, was born and very 
quickly became a Shepherd family af-
fair, spearheaded by Marcus. 
From carefully crafted pulled pork 
barbecue to exceptionally crisp fried 
catfish, Bubby’s BBQ has a vast selec-
tion of menu items that are undeniably 
delectable. Whether customers choose 
to order from the menu or opt for the 
all-you-can-eat buffet, it is certain 
that the food will always be excellent. 
Marcus ensures that all of the food 
served abides by his recipes, so that 
each meal eaten at Bubby’s tastes as if 
Marcus had whipped it up himself. The 
barbeque is smoked for 10–12 hours 
each night using hickory wood, and ev-
erything is homemade, right down to 
the BBQ sauce. This attention to detail 
is what has made Bubby’s BBQ widely 
recognized for its consistency and high- 
quality food. A testament to their suc-
cess, Bubby’s BBQ has won the People’s 
Choice Award for Best Restaurant sev-
eral years in a row in various cat-
egories. 
The delicious food attracts thousands 
of customers from all over Kentucky, 
and the welcoming ambience and high- 
quality service at Bubby’s makes peo-

are part of the restaurant family, and a 
missing regular never goes unnoticed 
by the staff. Some will go to the res-
taurant as many as four to five times a 
week and never get tired of the food. 
Bubby’s care is not limited to its cus-
tomers; it extends to its local commu-
nity. The restaurant hosts many fund-
raising events to raise money for the 
youth sports teams in the Corbin area. 
Bubby’s BBQ also uses its resources to 
support those who do not have stable 
access to food through its involvement 
in the Corbin Community Backpack 
Program, an initiative that provides 
local schoolchildren, who have little or 
no 
food 
available 
at 
their 
home, 
backpacks full of food to last them 
over 
the 
weekends. 
Additionally, 
Bubby’s BBQ assists with Operation 
James Scott, a veteran-led community 
activity that purchases Christmas pre-
sents for local children. 
Bubby’s BBQ has cultivated a famed 
reputation for its authenticity. There 
is a strong sense of comfort every guest 
can feel when they dine at Bubby’s. 
With food that resembles family cook-
ing, 
phenomenal 
service 
that 
prioritizes customer satisfaction, and 
interior design that reflects a southern 
country style, Bubby’s makes you feel 
at home. This quality of care and inti-
macy with customers is distinct to 
small businesses. Everyone who goes to 
Bubby’s BBQ knows there is just no 
place like it, nor could it ever be rep-
licated. Marcus’s ability to transform 
his passion into a successful business is 
an embodiment of the entrepreneurial 
spirit that uplifts this country. I want 
to thank Marcus Shepherd and the 
Shepherd family for all of the work 
they have done to support their com-
munity of Corbin and the American 
people. I look forward to watching your 
continued growth and success in Ken-
tucky.∑

TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS BOSTIC 
∑ Mr. YOUNG. Madam President, I rise 
today to formally express my gratitude 
for the heroic actions of Nicholas 
Bostic in Lafayette, IN, on July 11, 
2022. 
Just after midnight on Monday, July 
11, Nicholas Bostic ran into a burning 
home and rescued five children inside. 
Nicholas was driving and observed a 
home engulfed in flames. He stopped to 
make sure the residents had left the 
building, and he saw a teenager and 
three younger children stuck inside. 
Nicholas ran into the building to help 
the four children exit safely. When he 
discovered one child was still missing, 
Nicholas immediately reentered the 
home to find the missing child. By the 
time he found her, the fire had spread, 
making it unsafe to exit through the 
downstairs door. Nicholas broke the 
second story window and jumped out, 
sheltering the girl from the fall by 
landing on his side. Thanks to Nich-
olas, the child escaped with only minor 
injuries, and the other four children 
were unharmed. 
In helping shield the children from 
injury, Nicholas developed first-degree 
burns and suffered from smoke inhala-
tion. 
I 
pray 
for 
Nicholas 
as 
he 
recuperates from his injuries and wish 
him a full and swift recovery. I also 
want to recognize and thank the first 
responders who helped put out the fire 
and treat Nicholas and the children. 
Despite the danger, Nicholas did not 
hesitate to run into the burning build-
ing—twice—to 
make 
sure 
everyone 
safely escaped. I share the view of La-
fayette Police Department who noted, 
‘‘Nicholas Bostic’s heroic actions saved 
lives.’’ I join the Lafayette community 
in commending Nicholas for the self-
lessness he displayed. Today, I thank 
Nicholas for his heroism and am proud 
to call him a fellow Hoosier.∑

PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13441 OF AUGUST 1, 2007, WITH 
RESPECT TO LEBANON—PM 37 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to Leb-
anon declared in Executive Order 13441 
of August 1, 2007, is to continue in ef-
fect beyond August 1, 2022. 
Certain ongoing activities, such as 
Iran’s continuing arms transfers to 
Hizballah—which include increasingly 
sophisticated weapons systems—serve 
to undermine Lebanese sovereignty, 
contribute to political and economic 
instability in the region, and continue 
to constitute an unusual and extraor-
dinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the United States. 
Therefore, I have determined that it is 
necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13441 with respect to Lebanon.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-

were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–173. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Louisiana urging the United States Congress 
to enact federal legislation requiring food 
service establishments to notify patrons if 
they are serving imported shrimp; to the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 253 
Whereas, according to the National Oce-
anic and Atmospheric Administration, in 
2019 the United States imported six billion 
pounds of edible seafood products, including 
one and one half billion pounds of shrimp, an 
increase of nearly six and one half million 
pounds more than the shrimp imported in 
2018; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3781 
July 28, 2022 
Whereas, the 2019 shrimp imports alone, 
valued at six billion dollars, accounted for 
twenty-seven percent of the total value of 
imported seafood that year, which reached 
twenty-two billion dollars; and 
Whereas, it is estimated that over half of 
the imported seafood consumed in the United 
States is from aquaculture, or seafood farm-
ing, rather than wild-caught; and 
Whereas, the United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) is responsible for the 
safety of all fish and fishery products enter-
ing the United States and sold in Louisiana; 
and 
Whereas, the FDA’s seafood safety pro-
gram is governed by its Hazard Analysis 
Critical Control Point regulations, which ad-
dress food safety management through the 
analysis and control of biological, chemical, 
and physical hazards from raw material pro-
duction, procurement and handling, to man-
ufacturing, distribution, and consumption of 
the finished product; and 
Whereas, FDA regulations are supposed to 
measure compliance for imported seafood 
with inspections of foreign processing facili-
ties, sampling of seafood offered for import 
into the United States, domestic surveil-
lance sampling of imported products, inspec-
tions of seafood importers, foreign country 
program assessments, and the use of infor-
mation from foreign partners and FDA over-
seas offices; and 
Whereas, in 2011 the FDA was only inspect-
ing two percent of the seafood imported into 
the United States; and 
Whereas, unfortunately 2011 is the last 
year for which data regarding the percentage 
of imports inspected is available due to a 
lack of transparency and inadequate assess-
ment measures; and 
Whereas, in 2011 the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) noted that the FDA’s as-
sessments of foreign aquaculture operations 
was limited by the FDA’s lack of procedures, 
criteria, and standards; and ten years later, 
a 2021 GAO report found that the agency was 
failing to monitor the effectiveness of its 
own enforcement policies and procedures; 
and 
Whereas, in contrast, the European Union 
regularly conducts physical checks of ap-
proximately twenty percent of all imported 
fish products that are fresh, frozen, dry, salt-
ed, or hermetically sealed, and for certain 
fishery products, physical checks are con-
ducted on approximately fifty percent of im-
ports; and 
Whereas, the Louisiana State University 
School of Renewable Natural Resources pub-
lished a 2020 paper titled ‘‘Determination of 
Sulfite and Antimicrobial Residue in Im-
ported Shrimp to the USA’’, which presented 
findings from a study of shrimp imported 
from India, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, 
China, Bangladesh, and Ecuador and pur-
chased from retail stores in Baton Rouge, 
Louisiana; and 
Whereas, a screening of these shrimp for 
sulfites and residues from antimicrobial 
drugs found the following: (1) five percent of 
the shrimp contained malachite green, (2) 
seven percent contained oxytetracycline, (3) 
seventeen 
percent 
contained 
fluoroquinolone, and (4) seventy percent con-
tained nitrofurantoin, all of which have been 
banned by the FDA in domestic aquaculture 
operations; and 
Whereas, although the FDA requires that 
food products exposed to sulfites must in-
clude a label with a statement about the 
presence of sulfites, of the forty-three per-
cent of these locally purchased shrimp found 
to contain sulfites, not one package com-
plied with this labeling requirement; and 
Whereas the drug and sulfite residues in-
cluded in this screening, can be harmful to 
human health during both handling and con-
sumption and have been known to cause all 
of the following: liver damage and tumors, 
reproductive abnormalities, cardiac arrhyth-
mia, renal failure, hemolysis, asthma at-
tacks, and allergic reactions; and 
Whereas, the results of this study confirm 
that existing screening and enforcement 
measures for imported seafood are insuffi-
cient; whatever the percentage of imports in-
spected may be, seafood is currently being 
imported that contains unsafe substances 
that put American consumers at risk; and 
Whereas, because imported seafood is not 
held to the same standards as domestic sea-
food, domestic fishing industries are put at a 
distinct and significant disadvantage com-
mercially; and 
Whereas, according to the Louisiana De-
partment of Wildlife and Fisheries, the aver-
age value of Louisiana shrimp fell from three 
dollars eighty cents per pound in 1980 to one 
dollar fifty cents per pound in 2017; and 
Whereas, this unfair competition allows 
foreign competitors to flood the United 
States market with shrimp harvested under 
intensive 
farming 
practices 
using 
anti-
microbial drugs, while devastating local in-
dustries and the coastal communities built 
around them; and 
Whereas, Louisiana passed a law in 2019 re-
quiring food service establishments to pro-
vide notice to patrons that they are serving 
shrimp imported from, a foreign country; 
and 
Whereas, Louisiana Revised Statute 40:5.5.4 
requires any food service establishment that 
sells or provides cooked or prepared shrimp 
originating outside the United States to dis-
play the country of origin of such shrimp, or 
denote that it is imported, on all menus in 
the same font as the rest of the menu, or if 
no menu is used, to display such information 
on a sign at least eighteen inches tall and 
wide, located in a conspicuous place, with 
lettering at least one inch in size; and 
Whereas, like Louisiana consumers, con-
sumers across the United States deserve to 
be protected from harmful chemicals and 
residues found in imported shrimp; and 
Whereas, consumers across the United 
States likewise have the right to know 
whether the shrimp prepared and served to 
them in food service establishments are im-
ported; therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives of the Legislature of Louisiana does 
hereby memorialize the United States Con-
gress to enact federal legislation requiring 
food service establishments to provide notice 
to patrons if they are serving imported 
shrimp; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
Senate and the House of Representatives of 
Congress and to each member of the Lou-
isiana congressional delegation. 
POM–174. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Louisiana urging the United States Congress 
to support the Water Resources Development 
Act of 2022, including Congressman Troy 
Carter’s amendment to review recreational 
hazards along the banks of the Mississippi 
River, in order to protect lives by alerting 
the public to dangerous conditions on the 
river and riverbank; to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 210 
Whereas, three children tragically lost 
their lives in Algiers on April 23, 2022; and 
Whereas, 8–year-old Ally Wilson, 14–year- 
old Brandy Wilson, and 15–year-old Kevin 
Poole went missing while playing on the 
bank of the Mississippi River near the Cres-
cent City Connection and are believed to 
have been taken by the strong current of the 
river; and 
Whereas, this devastating tragedy has 
called attention to the dangers posed by 
open access to the banks of the Mississippi 
River and the lack of safety measures and 
warning signs cautioning the public against 
hazards along the riverbank and dangerous 
river conditions; and 
Whereas, the New Orleans City Council 
unanimously passed a resolution directing 
several government agencies to take all nec-
essary steps to install warning signs in the 
area where these children accessed the river; 
and 
Whereas, Congress is currently considering 
the Water Resources and Development Act of 
2022 (WRDA), a bill passed by every session 
of Congress that authorizes and funds the ac-
tivities of the United States Army Corps of 
Engineers relative to flood control, naviga-
tion, and ecosystem restoration; and 
Whereas, the Mississippi River levee sys-
tem is under the jurisdiction of the United 
States Army Corps of Engineers and the 
banks of the Mississippi River can be regu-
lated through legislation under WRDA; and 
Whereas, on May 18, 2022, Congressman 
Troy Carter of Louisiana was able to add an 
amendment to the United States House of 
Representatives version of WRDA, intro-
duced as H.R. 7776 of the 117th Congress, 
which would require the United States Army 
Corps of Engineers to review potential 
threats to human life and safety from rec-
reational areas at the banks of the Mis-
sissippi River in Louisiana and to install 
signage and other measures at such rec-
reational areas necessary to alert the public 
of hazardous water conditions or to other-
wise minimize or eliminate any identified 
threats to human life and safety; and 
Whereas, these efforts by the City of New 
Orleans and Congressman Troy Carter have 
the potential to save lives and prevent the 
type of tragic loss experienced by the Wilson 
and Poole families, and the Algiers commu-
nity, this spring: Now, Therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives of the Legislature of Louisiana does 
hereby memorialize the United States Con-
gress to support the Water Resources Devel-
opment Act of 2022, including Congressman 
Troy Carter’s amendment to review rec-
reational hazards along the banks of the Mis-
sissippi River, in order to protect lives by 
alerting the public to dangerous conditions 
on the river and riverbank; and be it further 
Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be 
transmitted to the presiding officers of the 
United States Senate, the House of Rep-
resentatives, and to each member of the Lou-
isiana congressional delegation.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, 
Mr. 
PADILLA, 
and 
Mr. 
HICKENLOOPER): 
S. 4666. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a de-
duction for attorney fees awarded with 
respect to certain wildfire damages and 
to exclude from gross income settle-
ment funds received with respect to 
such damages; to the Committee on Fi-
nance. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak in support of legislation 
that I introduced today along with 
Senators 
ALEX
PADILLA
and 
JOHN 
HICKENLOOPER. This is a companion to 
the bipartisan bill that Representative 
MIKE THOMPSON has introduced in the 
House of Representatives. 
In 2020, the Fire Victim Trust was es-
tablished after Pacific Gas & Electric, 
PG&E, was found legally responsible 
for major California wildfires in 2015, 
2017, and 2018. PG&E contributed about 
$13 billion to this fund to pay victims 
of these wildfires to cover losses they 
suffered. 
Unfortunately, the specific situations 
of each of these victims is different, 
and it is unclear to many whether they 
will need to pay Federal income tax on 
the amounts they receive. Moreover, it 
is unfair that these victims should 
have to worry about paying taxes on 
amounts that are simply intended to 
make them whole. 
In addition, about 30 percent of set-
tlement payouts are devoted to attor-
ney fees, for attorneys whom the vic-
tims did not hire. It appears that vic-
tims will even owe taxes on the full 
amount of the settlement, including 
these attorney fees. 
This is a problem now for wildfire 
victims in California. However, as the 
frequency and severity of wildfires 
grows 
across 
the 
Western 
United 
States due to climate change, it is 
more likely that this is a problem that 
California and other States will face 
again. 
Our legislation would do two things. 
First, it would clarify that such wild-
fire settlement fees are not taxable. 
Second, it would create an above-the- 
line tax deduction for relevant attor-
ney fees. This would provide tax cer-
tainty and fairness to wildfire settle-
ment victims now and into the future. 
With the incidence of wildfires rising, 
this is an important issue for Congress 
to address now to avoid victims having 
to worry about paying taxes on settle-
ment payments that are meant to 
make them whole from devastating 
losses that many of them have suf-
fered. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
support of this bill. 
By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 4669. A bill to establish the West-
ern Riverside National Wildlife Refuge, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on Environment and Public 
Works. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to introduce the Western 
Riverside County National Wildlife 
Refuge Act, along with my California 
colleague, Senator ALEX PADILLA. 
As our country’s population grows, so 
does the need for infrastructure like 
housing and highways. However, we 
must find a way to balance the needs of 
growth with the preservation of our 
natural resources, including endan-
gered species habitat and green space 
for the health and safety of our com-
munities. 
Senator PADILLA and I are proud this 
legislation 
would 
accomplish 
those 
goals by creating a Federal wildlife ref-
uge in western Riverside County as 
part of a collaborative land manage-
ment plan created by Riverside Coun-
ty. 
The newly created wildlife refuge 
would provide expanded recreation, 
conservation, and educational opportu-
nities for the local community—one of 
the fastest growing in the Nation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3785 
July 28, 2022 
This legislation builds off Riverside 
County’s multiple species habitat con-
servation plan, allowing land that has 
already been acquired by the Western 
Riverside County Regional Conserva-
tion Authority to be included in the 
new Federal wildlife refuge this bill 
would create. 
Our bill would establish a new unit of 
the National Wildlife Refuge System— 
the Western Riverside County National 
Wildlife Refuge. The refuge would be 
comprised of donated lands from West-
ern Riverside County Regional Con-
servation Authority, as well as any ad-
ditional lands deemed appropriate by 
the Interior Department acquired from 
willing sellers or donors, including 
Federal, 
State, 
or 
local 
agencies, 
Tribes, or private land owners. 
This refuge would not only create in-
creased recreation, outdoor access, and 
educational opportunities in Southern 
California but also work to protect en-
dangered species in the region like the 
arroyo toad, the southwestern willow 
flycatcher, and the quino checkerspot 
butterfly. These protections would in 
turn help streamline infrastructure 
projects and support smart growth and 
land management planning. 
As temperatures continue to rise and 
California experiences another historic 
drought and wildfire season, it is more 
important than ever to ensure that we 
conserve green spaces. As I stated ear-
lier, Riverside County’s population is 
one of the fastest growing in the coun-
try, and it is well documented that 
human development can have dam-
aging effects on the health of endan-
gered and threatened species. Addition-
ally, overdevelopment results in poor 
community health and well-being. 
That is why smart, collaborative 
land management planning is our best 
option on how to move forward with a 
growing 
population 
and 
economy, 
while safeguarding the resources that 
keep our communities and wildlife pop-
ulations healthy. 
This bill would support the conserva-
tion of habitat for 146 different species 
in the region, including 33 species that 
are listed as threatened or endangered 
by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
and the California Department of Fish 
and Wildlife. The acquisition boundary 
for the refuge was created in collabora-
tion with the county, environmental 
groups and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service. The boundary area expands on 
local conservation efforts and increase 
access to green spaces, especially to 
underserved communities. 
The coronavirus pandemic and recent 
extreme heat waves in our State have 
served to underscore the importance of 
ensuring access and preservation of 
open spaces, especially as our Nation’s 
population grows and its cities expand. 
This bill also meets the Biden admin-
istration’s call to conserve 30 percent 
of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, an ini-
tiative known as America the Beau-
tiful. We are proud the creation of this 
refuge would contribute to that impor-
tant goal. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this legislation. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Mr. CRAMER): 
S. 4672. A bill to modify the author-
ity of the Secretary of Defense to 
transfer excess aircraft to other de-
partments of the Federal Government 
and to authorize the Secretary to 
transfer excess aircraft to the Gov-
ernor of a State, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Armed 
Services. 
Mr. PADILLA, Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce the bipartisan Emergency 
Aircraft Act of 2022. 
Currently, DOD has a program to 
transfer excess aircraft to Federal 
Agencies for wildfire suppression pur-
poses. However, under current law, 
DOD is limited to providing only seven 
aircraft total to each Agency. 
After years of increasingly cata-
strophic wildfires, it has become clear 
that the Federal Government must do 
more to support suppression efforts to 
get fires under control quickly, as well 
as support search and rescue to keep 
communities safe. If there are excess 
aircraft available, they should be put 
to use suppressing fires and protecting 
communities. 
Furthermore, as fire activity has ex-
ploded in the past few years, States 
have stepped up and greatly increased 
their own suppression efforts. They 
should also be allowed to utilize these 
excess aircraft to increase suppression 
capabilities and put fires out faster. 
However, under current law, States do 
not have access to these excess air-
craft. 
This bill would remove the arbitrary 
cap on how many excess aircraft DOD 
can transfer to Federal Agencies for 
wildfire 
suppression 
efforts; 
allow 
States to receive excess aircraft; ex-
pand the purposes for which these air-
craft could be used from just ‘‘wildfire 
suppression purposes’’ to include pur-
poses of ‘‘wildfire suppression, search 
and rescue, or emergency operations 
pertaining to wildfires’’; and mandate 
an annual report from DOD to the 
Committees on Armed Services of the 
Senate and the House of Representa-
tives on aircraft transferred during the 
previous fiscal year. 
This bill represents a commonsense 
step forward to expand fire suppression 
and 
search 
and 
rescue 
operations 
across the Federal Government and 
State governments. 
I want to thank Senator CRAMER for 
joining me in this bipartisan effort, 
and I urge my colleagues to join us in 
working to pass this bill as quickly as 
possible in light of the extreme wildfire 
danger facing States across the coun-
try.

Whereas the digital economy encompasses 
the economic and social activity from bil-
lions of online connections among people,

mestic 
product 
and 
supported 
7,800,000 
United States jobs in 2020;

counting for more than half of all United 
States services exports and generating a dig-
ital services trade surplus for the United

Whereas digital trade bolsters the digital 
economy by enabling the sale of goods on the

of data across borders to promote commerce, 
manufacturing, and innovation; 
Whereas digital trade has become increas-

nology sector, such as manufacturing and 
agriculture, are integrating digital tech-
nology into their businesses in order to in-
crease efficiency, improve safety, reach new 
customers, and remain globally competitive; 
Whereas the increasing reliance on digital 
technologies has modernized legacy proc-
esses, accelerated workflows, increased ac-
cess 
to 
information 
and 
services, 
and 
strengthened security in a variety of indus-
tries, leading to better health, environ-
mental, and safety outcomes; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has led to 
increased uptake and reliance on digital 
technologies, data flows, and e-commerce; 
Whereas 90 percent of adults in the United 
States say that the internet has been essen-
tial or important for them personally during 
the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas United States families, workers, 
and business owners have seen how vital ac-
cess to the internet has been to daily life, as 
work, education, medicine, and communica-
tion with family and friends have shifted in-
creasingly online; 
Whereas many individuals and families, es-
pecially in rural and Tribal communities, 
struggle to participate in the digital econ-
omy because of a lack of access to a reliable 
and affordable internet connection; 
Whereas new developments in technology 
must be deployed with consideration to the 
unique access challenges of rural, urban un-
derserved, and vulnerable communities; 
Whereas digital trade has the power to 
help level the playing field and uplift those 
in traditionally unrepresented or underrep-
resented communities; 
Whereas countries have negotiated inter-
national rules governing digital trade in var-
ious bilateral and plurilateral agreements, 
but those rules remain fragmented, and no 
multilateral agreement on digital trade ex-
ists within the World Trade Organization; 
Whereas the United States, through free 
trade agreements or other digital agree-
ments, has been a leader in developing a set 
of rules and standards on digital governance 
and e-commerce that has helped allies and 
partners of the United States unlock the full 
economic and social potential of digital 
trade; 
Whereas Congress recognizes the need for 
agreements on digital trade, as indicated by 
its support for a robust digital trade chapter 
in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agree-
ment; 
Whereas other countries are operating 
under their own digital rules, some of which 
are contrary to democratic values shared by 
the United States and many allies and part-
ners of the United States; 
Whereas those countries are attempting to 
advance their own digital rules on a global 
scale; 
Whereas examples of the plethora of non-
tariff barriers to digital trade that have 
emerged around the globe include— 
(1) overly restrictive data localization re-
quirements and limitations on cross border 
data flows that do not achieve legitimate 
public policy objectives; 
(2) intellectual property rights infringe-
ment; 
(3) policies that make market access con-
tingent on forced technology transfers or 
voluntary 
transfers 
subject 
to 
coercive 
terms; 
(4) web filtering; 
(5) economic espionage; 
(6) cybercrime exposure; and 
(7) government-directed theft of trade se-
crets; 
Whereas certain countries are pursuing or 
have implemented digital policies that un-
fairly 
discriminate 
against 
innovative 
United States technology companies and 
United States workers that create and de-
liver digital products and services; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China is currently advancing a 
model for digital governance and the digital 
economy domestically and abroad through 
its Digital Silk Road Initiative that permits 
censorship, surveillance, human and worker 
rights abuses, forced technology transfers, 
and data flow restrictions at the expense of 
human and worker rights, privacy, the free 
flow of data, and an open internet; 
Whereas the 2020 Country Reports on 
Human Rights Practices of the Department 
of 
State 
highlighted 
significant 
human 
rights issues committed by the People’s Re-
public of China in the digital realm, includ-
ing ‘‘arbitrary interference with privacy; 
pervasive and intrusive technical surveil-
lance and monitoring; serious restrictions on 
free expression, the press, and the internet, 
including physical attacks on and criminal 
prosecution of journalists, lawyers, writers, 
bloggers, dissidents, petitioners, and others 
as well as their family members, and censor-
ship and site blocking’’; 
Whereas the United States discourages dig-
ital authoritarianism, including practices 
that undermine human and worker rights 
and result in other social and economic coer-
cion; 
Whereas allies and trading partners of the 
United States in the Indo-Pacific region 
have urged the United States to deepen eco-
nomic engagement in the region by negoti-
ating rules on digital trade and technology 
standards; 
Whereas the digital economy has provided 
new opportunities for economic develop-
ment, entrepreneurship, and growth in devel-
oping countries around the world; 
Whereas negotiating strong digital trade 
principles and commitments with allies and 
partners across the globe enables the United 
States 
to 
unite 
like-minded 
economies 
around common standards and ensure that 
principles of democracy, rule of law, freedom 
of speech, human and worker rights, privacy, 
and a free and open internet are at the very 
core of digital governance; 
Whereas United States leadership and sub-
stantive engagement is necessary to ensure 
that global digital rules reflect United 
States values so that workers are treated 
fairly, small businesses can compete and win 
in the global economy, and consumers are 
guaranteed the right to privacy and security; 
Whereas the United States supports rules 
that reduce digital trade barriers, promote 
free expression and the free flow of informa-
tion, enhance privacy protections, protect 
sensitive information, defend human and 
worker rights, prohibit forced technology 
transfer, and promote digitally enabled com-
merce; and 
Whereas the United States supports efforts 
to cooperate with allies and trading partners 
to mitigate the risks of cyberattacks, ad-
dress potentially illegal or deceptive busi-
ness activities online, promote financial in-
clusion and digital workforce skills, and de-
velop rules to govern the use of artificial in-
telligence and other emerging and future 
technologies: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the United States should negotiate 
strong, inclusive, forward-looking, and en-
forceable rules on digital trade and the dig-
ital economy with like-minded countries as 
part of a broader trade and economic strat-
egy to address digital barriers and ensure 
that the United States values of democracy, 
rule of law, freedom of speech, human and 
worker rights, privacy, and a free and open 
internet are at the very core of the digital 
world and advanced technology; 
(2) in conducting such negotiations, the 
United States must— 
(A) pursue digital trade rules that— 
(i) serve the best interests of workers, con-
sumers, and small and medium-sized enter-
prises; 
(ii) empower United States workers; 
(iii) fuel wage growth; and 
(iv) lead to materially positive economic 
outcomes for all people in the United States; 
(B) ensure that any future agreement pre-
vents the adoption of non-democratic, coer-
cive, or overly restrictive policies that would 
be obstacles to a free and open internet and 
harm the ability of the e-commerce market-
place to continue to grow and thrive; 
(C) coordinate sufficient trade-related as-
sistance to ensure that developing countries 
can improve their capacity and benefit from 
increased digital trade; and 
(D) consult closely with all relevant stake-
holders, including workers, consumers, small 
and medium-sized enterprises, civil society 
groups, and human rights advocates; and 
(3) with respect to any negotiations for an 
agreement facilitating digital trade, the 
United States Trade Representative and the 
heads of other relevant Federal agencies 
must— 
(A) consult closely and on a timely basis 
with the Committee on Finance of the Sen-
ate and the Committee on Ways and Means 
of the House of Representatives about the 
substance of those negotiations and the req-
uisite legal authority to bind the United 
States to any such agreement; 
(B) keep both committees fully apprised of 
those negotiations; and 
(C) provide to those committees, including 
staff with appropriate security clearances, 
adequate access to the text of the negoti-
ating proposal of the United States before 
presenting the proposal in the negotiations.

Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself,

submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 728 
Whereas July 11, 2022, marked 1 year since 
the largest anti-government demonstration 
in Cuba when thousands of brave protestors 
took to the streets in more than 40 cities to 
peacefully demand access to fundamental 
freedoms and civil liberties and call for an 
end to communism, censorship, and the op-
pressive leadership of the Communist regime 
in Cuba; 
Whereas the regime, in an attempt to si-
lence the Cuban people, responded to the 
demonstration with a wave of terror, repres-
sion, and criminalization and detained and 
persecuted more than 1,400 protestors;

Whereas more than 700 of such protestors, 
including children, remain unjustly impris-
oned and are subjected to torture and inhu-
mane living conditions, with many of such 
protestors having been sentenced to decades- 
long prison sentences; 
Whereas the ongoing imprisonment of Jose 
Daniel Ferrer Garcia, a Cuban human rights 
and democracy activist who has worked tire-
lessly to advocate for fundamental civil lib-
erties for the Cuban people, is representative 
of the tactics of the brutal and despotic re-
gime; 
Whereas Garcia was among the hundreds of 
protestors who were unlawfully detained, 
were denied due process, and received unfair 
trials conducted by secret tribunals; 
Whereas, according to a statement by the 
family of Garcia in January 2022, Garcia was 
subjected to months of solitary confinement, 
physical and psychological torture, and in-
humane treatment from Cuban operatives, 
resulting in dire health conditions; 
Whereas Garcia has suffered from severe 
headaches, mouth bleeding, malnutrition, 
bouts of coughing, and the inability to sleep; 
Whereas, more than 1 year into the unjust 
imprisonment of Garcia by the Communist 
regime in Cuba, Garcia continues to be sub-
jected to brutal, torturous, and inhumane 
conditions by the regime, including isolation 
and confinement to a small-walled cell with 
no access to natural light, denial of physical 
or verbal contact with family for months at 
a time, and denial of daily contact with 
other individuals; 
Whereas, according to the family of Gar-
cia, Garcia is now suffering from breathing 
problems and vision loss and shows bodily 
signs of ongoing torture; 
Whereas the deteriorating and dire health 
conditions of Garcia are directly attrib-
utable to the cruel and inhumane conditions 
to which the regime has subjected Garcia, 
solely for engaging in peaceful demonstra-
tions and calling for freedom and democracy 
for the people of Cuba; 
Whereas hundreds of pro-democracy activ-
ists have been imprisoned solely for peace-
fully exercising their God-given right to 
freedom of expression, including— 
(1) Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and 
Maykel ‘‘Osorbo’’ Castillo of the San Isidro 
Movement; 
(2) Jose Diaz Silva of the Opposition Move-
ment for a New Republic; 
(3) Arianna Lopez Roque of the Julio 
Machado Academy; 
(4) Emiyosian Roman Rodriguez, a 17-year- 
old who shouted ‘‘Patria y Vida’’ and was 
sent to a forced labor camp for 5 years; 
(5) Duannis Dabel Leon Taboada, a 22-year- 
old barber who was sentenced to 14 years; 
and 
(6) young women such as Lisandra Gongora 
Espinosa and the Garrido sisters, Loreto 
Hernandez and Donaida Perez; 
Whereas the illegitimate Communist re-
gime in Cuba— 
(1) is terrified of brave and courageous 
leaders who stand resolute in speaking out 
against the crimes against humanity com-
mitted by the regime; and 
(2) will persecute, kidnap, torture, and 
eventually 
kill 
anyone 
who 
stands 
up 
against the tyranny of the regime; and 
Whereas, by working together, freedom- 
loving nations can help bring positive change 
and democracy to the people of Cuba: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends the bravery, courage, and re-
solve of the pro-democracy movement and 
all freedom activists in Cuba for risking ev-
erything to bring freedom to the Cuban peo-
ple; 
(2) condemns the repression of the hun-
dreds of pro-democracy activists and polit-
ical prisoners, including children, that the 
Cuban regime is unjustly detaining and sub-
jecting to physical and psychological tor-
ture, and calls for the immediate and uncon-
ditional release of such prisoners; 
(3) condemns the brutal torture and inhu-
mane treatment of Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia 
by the Cuban regime, and calls for an imme-
diate humanitarian medical visit to Garcia 
and all political prisoners who have been un-
justly and illegally detained since July 11, 
2021; 
(4) condemns the brutal totalitarian Com-
munist dictatorship in Cuba, and demands an 
end to the suffering of the Cuban people and 
the impunity of the human rights abusers of 
the regime; 
(5) calls for the international community 
to stand with the Cuban people and speak 
out against the totalitarian Communist re-
gime in Cuba for infringing on the freedom of 
thought, will, expression, assembly, and 
prosperity of the Cuban people; and 
(6) urges the President to firmly declare 
that the United States Government will not 
consider any more concessions or sanctions 
relief to the brutal, illegitimate Communist 
regime in Cuba until all conditions for re-
moving sanctions are met in accordance with 
the laws of the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 730—REMEM-
BERING THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE BOMBING OF THE EM-
BASSY OF ISRAEL IN BUENOS 
AIRES ON MARCH 17, 1992, THE 
28TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
BOMBING OF THE ARGENTINE- 
ISRAELI MUTUAL ASSOCIATION 
BUILDING IN BUENOS AIRES ON 
JULY 18, 1994, AND RECOMMIT-
TING TO EFFORTS TO UPHOLD 
JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF 
THE ATTACKS 
Mr. RUBIO (for himself, Mr. MENEN-
DEZ, Mr. COTTON, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. 
KAINE, and Mr. COONS) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations: 
S. RES. 730 
Whereas, on March 17, 1992, a truck laden 
with explosives struck and detonated at the 
Embassy of Israel in Buenos Aires, Argen-
tina, killing 29 people and wounding more 
than 200 others; 
Whereas Argentina is home to the largest 
Jewish community in Latin America—and 
the sixth largest in the world, outside Israel; 
Whereas, in 1999, the Supreme Court of Ar-
gentina, after conducting an investigation, 
found that the Lebanese terrorist organiza-
tion Hezbollah was responsible for the bomb-
ing, which claimed the lives of Israeli dip-
lomats, their relatives, and numerous Argen-
tine citizens and children; 
Whereas, 2 years after the bombing of the 
Embassy of Israel in Argentina, on July 18, 
1994, a car bomb detonated at the Argentine 
Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) Jewish 
Community Center building in Buenos Aires, 
killing 85 people and wounding more than 300 
others, rendering it the deadliest terrorist 
attack in Argentina’s history; 
Whereas, for 25 years, the investigation 
into the AMIA bombing has been stymied by 
international 
inaction, 
political 
inter-
ference, investigative misconduct, and alle-
gations of cover-ups, including the removal 
of the Federal judge in charge of the case in 
2005 for ‘‘serious’’ irregularities in his han-
dling of the case; 
Whereas, in October 2006, Argentine pros-
ecutors Alberto Nisman and Marcelo Martı´n 
Burgos formally accused the Government of 
Iran of directing Hezbollah to carry out the 
AMIA bombing; 
Whereas 
the 
Argentine 
prosecutors 
charged the following Iranian nationals as 
suspects in the AMIA bombing: 
(1) Ali Fallahijan, Iran’s former intel-
ligence minister; 
(2) Mohsen Rabbani, Iran’s former cultural 
attache´ in Buenos Aires; 
(3) Ahmad Reza Asghari, a former Iranian 
diplomat posted to Argentina; 
(4) Ahmad Vahidi, Iran’s former defense 
minister; 
(5) Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran’s former for-
eign minister; 
(6) Mohsen Rezaee, former chief com-
mander of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard Corps; 
(7) Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, former 
President of Iran; and 
(8) Hadi Soleimanpour, former Iranian am-
bassador to Argentina; 
Whereas, in November 2007, the Inter-
national 
Criminal 
Police 
Organization 
(INTERPOL) published Red Notices on 5 of 
the Iranian nationals and Hezbollah opera-
tive Ibrahim Hussein Berro; 
Whereas those with INTERPOL Red No-
tices have repeatedly traveled internation-
ally with impunity on more than 20 occa-
sions since 2007; 
Whereas, in May 2013, Argentine pros-
ecutor Alberto Nisman published a 500-page 
report accusing the Government of Iran of 
establishing terrorist networks throughout 
Latin America; 
Whereas, in January 2015, Mr. Nisman re-
leased the results of an investigation alleg-
ing 
that 
then-President 
Fernandez 
de 
Kirchner 
and 
then-Foreign 
Minister 
Timerman conspired to cover up Iranian in-
volvement in the 1994 AMIA bombing and 
that they had agreed to negotiate immunity 
for Iranian suspects and secure the removal 
of the INTERPOL Red Notices; 
Whereas Mr. Nisman was scheduled to 
present his findings to a commission of the 
Argentine National Congress on January 19, 
2015, but on January 18, 2015, was found dead 
as the result of a gunshot wound to his head 
in his apartment in Buenos Aires; and 
Whereas, to date, no one has been brought 
to justice for the 1992 bombing of the Israeli 
Embassy in Argentina, the 1994 bombing of 
the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Bue-
nos Aires, or the death of Argentine pros-
ecutor Alberto Nisman: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reiterates its strongest condemnation of 
the 1992 attack on the Israeli Embassy in Ar-
gentina and the 1994 attack on the Argentine 
Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) Jewish 
Community Center in Buenos Aires; 
(2) honors the victims of the 1992 bombing 
of the Israeli Embassy in Argentina and the 
1994 AMIA bombing, and expresses its sym-
pathy to the relatives of the victims, who

and a legacy of faithful service and commit-
ment to Bedford County. My prayers are with 
his wife of 64 years, Ora, and the family, 
friends and community who are grieving his 
passing. 
In addition to his 22-year commitment to 
serving his county as sheriff, Mr. Wells was 
also a member of Bedford Baptist church for 
many years and was actively engaged in his 
community through participation in multiple 
volunteer service groups including the Bedford 
Elks Lodge, the Lions Club, the Shriners, and 
many others. 
On behalf of my constituents and my col-
leagues, it is a privilege to recognize Sheriff 
Well’s life and service to Virginians. He will be 
missed but not forgotten.

RECOGNIZING THE SACRIFICE OF 
BUFFALO SOLDIERS 
HON. AUGUST PFLUGER 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor National Buffalo Soldiers Day, 
a day commemorating the formation of the 
first Army regiments comprised of African 
American Soldiers. 
In 1866, Congress passed the Army Organi-
zation Act to allow former slaves to fight for 
our Nation during the Civil War. More than 
180,000 African-American men served their 
country with pride and distinction despite chal-
lenging terrain, limited supplies, and discrimi-
nation. 
More than 100 years later, to recognize their 
valiant service, Congress passed a law desig-
nating July 28th as National Buffalo Soldiers 
Day. 
Today, we honor the incredible bravery of 
these 180,000 men who helped secure lasting 
freedom for our Nation. The Buffalo Soldiers 
answered the call to fight for our country’s 
freedom while also paving the way for many 
future service members. Their service was piv-
otal to securing our country’s freedom, and 
today, we commemorate and honor their sac-
rifice. 
Each of these men earned the recognition 
they receive on this commemorative day. 
Even through hardship, their service to the 
United States was unwavering, offering a 
glimpse of their American pride and incredible 
character. 
In my hometown of San Angelo, the local 
NAACP chapter is hosting a three-day cele-
bration to commemorate these brave men and 
the sacrifices they made. 
Under the leadership of President Sherley 
Spears, San Angelo’s NAACP is ensuring sol-
diers from our local community receive the 
recognition they deserve for their sacrifices for 
our country. 
Thank you to Mrs. Spears and the San An-
gelo NAACP for honoring the life and legacy 
of The Buffalo Soldiers both in the Concho 
Valley and across our Nation. 
The Buffalo Soldiers, along with generations 
of service men and women who have fought 
for our country both before and after these 
brave men, are true American heroes. May we 
never forget the sacrifices they have made 
and may God bless all current and former 
service men and women.

HONORING SERGEANT AARON 
DELGADO 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the retirement of Sergeant Aaron 
Delgado from the Monterey Police Department 
after 28 years of service to the security of the 
community of Monterey. Sergeant Delgado’s 
legacy of dedication to his community and the 
Monterey Police Department will last far be-
yond his tenure and continue to serve as a 
prime example of an unwavering commitment 
to protecting the lives of others. 
Born in Inglewood, CA, Sergeant Delgado 
graduated from Seaside High School in 1990, 
and began his career in 1993 as a Police 
Services Technician. After six years, Sergeant 
Delgado was accepted to the Police Academy 
and was sworn in as a Police Officer in May 
of 1999. His elevation in the Department led to 
a vast new horizon of assignments and re-
sponsibilities. 
As a Police Officer, Sergeant Delgado 
served in a myriad role within the department, 
including Patrol Officer, Detective, Field Train-
ing Officer, and Community Action Team Offi-
cer. He also led trainings and instruction in the 
use of firearms, tasers, and chemical agents 
for new officers. The versatility of his service 
demonstrates his enthusiasm for the field and 
a desire to assist and serve. 
Furthermore, Sergeant Delgado was instru-
mental in many police calls and emergency 
situations over the course of his career with 
the Monterey Police Department. In 2004, Ser-
geant Delgado successfully located and ar-
rested the suspect of a shooting in downtown 
Monterey. In 2009, he located the suspect re-
sponsible for making threatening phone calls 
to women and was fundamental in making 
sure the suspect was taken into custody. 
Mr. Aaron Delgado’s promotion to Sergeant 
in 2011 cemented his legacy as a dedicated 
public servant to the people of Monterey and 
his fellow colleagues in the Monterey Police 
Department. His spirit of service is one that is 
essential in policing and in his retirement, his 
career will serve as a model to new genera-
tions of police officers in our community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to join me in recog-
nizing Sergeant Delgado’s decades of service 
to this community. I extend my personal ap-
preciation to Sergeant Delgado and his love 
and commitment to the people of Monterey.

KATE MIHAL 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of meeting Kate 
Mihal (Me-Hall), a resident of Cape May Court 
House, South Jersey. Kate is currently a soph-
omore at Stockton University where she stud-
ies environmental science. In her free time, 
she participates in showings of horses, pigs, 
chickens, ducks, and rabbits through the 4-H 
Foundation. When I met Kate last week, she 
was auctioning off a pig she raised to help 
provide funding for her school. At the auction, 
a man named Warren bought Kate’s pig for 
$40.50 a pound, a record price for Cape May 
County. Through her participation in the 4-H 
Foundation, Kate has not only taken part in 
animal showings, but also learned leadership 
and teamwork skills that have shaped her into 
who she is today. Kate should be proud of her 
many accomplishments through this organiza-
tion, and it was my honor to speak with her 
last week. God Bless Kate, and God Bless our 
United States of America.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF CHAIRMAN MICHAEL LONG 
HON. ANDREW R. GARBARINO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. GARBARINO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in honor of the recently de-
parted Chairman Michael R. Long, who served 
his community, his state, and his Nation with 
pride and distinction for decades. Born in 
Brooklyn, New York, Chairman Long was a 
staunch conservative who dedicated his entire 
life to furthering the support of conservative 
values across our great sate. 
After serving his country as a Marine, Chair-
man Long jumped into action once again, 
working tirelessly to support various presi-
dential, gubernatorial, and mayoral candidates 
over the years. From 1981 to 1983, Chairman 
Long served his community as Brooklyn’s at- 
large City Council member. In this position, 
Chairman Long was unwavering in his beliefs, 
fervent in his support of conservative values, 
and quickly rose to the position of Conserv-
ative Party Chairman just a few years later. 
In addition to his public service and political 
endeavors, Chairman Long was also an entre-
preneur and businessman, having owned a 
bar and grill, ice cream parlor, and liquor store 
with his brother, Tom. Chairman Long also 
served as the president of his local business-
man’s association, a school board member, 
and an officer in various other civic groups, in-
cluding the Committee to Restore Respect, 
Honor, and Dignity to Policemen. 
In all that he did, Chairman Long emerged 
as a steadfast, common-sense leader who 
was never afraid to speak his mind. While 
countless New Yorkers mourn his passing, let 
us take a moment to reflect upon Chairman 
Michael Long’s many contributions to his com-
munity and his party. May his efforts inspire 
countless generations of future public serv-
ants, and may we continue to honor his mem-
ory for years to come.

Mr. CARL. Madam Speaker, remembering

portant, and few Alabama politicians gave 
more in service than Representative Stephen 
A. ‘‘Steve’’ McMillan. 
McMillan served for 42 years in the Ala-

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF FIESTA 
DEL SOL 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
want to honor Fiesta Del Sol, the largest 
Latino festival in the Midwest, as it celebrates 
its 50th Anniversary this month. 
Fiesta Del Sol hails from my district in 
Pilsen—the first neighborhood my parents and 
siblings found a home in when we arrived 
from Mexico. Pilsen’s been a gateway for 
countless immigrant families, and it proudly 
continues to reflect and elevate the Mexican 
community in Chicago. We gather during the 
Fiesta del Sol to celebrate the richness of our 
culture through music, food, and community 
empowerment. 
Born in 1973, Fiesta del Sol was in part the 
result of the rising political power of the Chi-
cano and Mexican American community. That 
year, the Pilsen Neighborhood Community 
Council, a non-profit community-based organi-
zation, led a successful campaign to build a 
new public high school in the heart of the 
neighborhood, the Benito Jua´rez Community 
Academy. The organizers hosted a block party 
to celebrate this victory, and thus the first Fi-
esta del Sol was born.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

July 28, 2022 
Today, this four-day event attracts more 
than one million people, spans an eightblock 
space down Cermak Road, and can be seen 
from miles around in Chicago because of its 
Ferris wheel and bright lights. Fiesta del Sol 
also raises funds to provide scholarships for 
young people needing assistance as they 
enter colleges and universities. 
In its more than 100 booths you will find 
some of the best Mexican food in town, as 
well as artists and artisans who come to 
showcase their talent. Fiesta also is an oppor-
tunity for the community to get information 
about health care, immigration, environmental 
justice and college readiness. And while it fea-
tures popular talent, it has also created oppor-
tunities for up-and-coming performers. 
Fiesta del Sol has become such a signifi-
cant event for the Latino community, that a 
promotional poster for the festival, created by 
artist Alejandro Romero, is now part of the 
Smithsonian American Art collection. 
As the Mexican community in Chicago has 
grown and evolved, so has Fiesta del Sol. Or-
ganizations like the Pilsen Neighborhood 
Community Council have expanded their 
reach, continuing to engage and activate peo-
ple to address the community needs, training 
organizers, and neighbors to advocate for 
themselves, their families and for the benefit 
of the community as a whole. 
Fiesta del Sol reminds us of the rich history 
of the Mexican community and the remarkable 
cultural and economic contributions we have 
brought to Chicago and the Midwest. Let’s cel-
ebrate its 50th anniversary.

RECOGNIZING THE 125TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE HAMLINE CHURCH 
DINING HALL 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the congregation of Hamline 
Church on the momentous occasion of the 
125th anniversary of the Hamline Church Din-
ing Hall at the Minnesota State Fair. The din-
ing hall is the oldest continuous food conces-
sion at what we like to call ‘‘The Great Min-
nesota Get-Together.’’ 
Back in 1897, a small group of women from 
the Hamline Methodist Episcopal Church La-
dies Aid Society decided to try selling cold 
drinks and sandwiches at the fair to raise 
money for the church. This humble fundraising 
effort quickly grew into a dining hall with a full 
menu that is a staple of the Minnesota State 
Fair. Unlike those early days, the Hamline 
Church Dining Hall at 1667 Dan Patch Avenue 
is now owned by the church and boasts 
modem conveniences of plumbing and elec-
tricity, which are appreciated by patrons and 
volunteers alike. 
Over the’ years, there have been a few 
other changes. In 1935, for a dinner of meat 
or ham loaf, boiled potatoes, coleslaw, beet 
pickles; pie, ice cream and a beverage, plus 
free second helpings, a patron at the Hamline 
Dining Hall paid only 35 cents. This value and 
the homegrown hospitality helped the hall sur-
vive the Great Depression when many others 
closed down. World War II food rationing 
forced more flexibility and adaptation. As the 
menu has grown and changed over the many 
years, a perennial favorite is ham loaf topped 
with honey-mustard sauce. In 2012 they 
partnered with local small business Izzy’s Ice 
Cream and began selling ice cream and other 
take-away items, including their very own fla-
vor of Church Elderberry Ice Cream. An adap-
tation of their traditional Swedish meatballs to 
Cranberry Wild Rice Meatballs served with 
lingonberry sauce earned them a spot on the 
highly acclaimed New Foods list for the fair in 
2017. 
With more than 300 food vendors at the 
Minnesota State Fair, the Hamline Church 
Dining Hall remains popular for its high-quality 
food and generous hospitality. During each of 
the past 125 years, the Dining Hall has been 
largely volunteer-run, 25 of whom have been 
specially recognized by the fair for 50 years of 
service. Their hospitality extends well beyond 
fairgoers—a portion of each year’s proceeds 
goes to provide meals for organizations like 
The Sheridan Story, Emma Norton Services 
and Feed My Starving Children. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in paying 
tribute to the congregation and many incred-
ible volunteers of the Hamline Church Dining 
Hall as they celebrate 125 years of serving up 
delicious homecooked meals and generous 
hospitality 
to 
hungry 
Minnesota 
State 
Fairgoers.

HONORING MEALS ON WHEELS OF 
THE MONTEREY PENINSULA 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the half-century of service Meals 
on Wheels of the Monterey Peninsula has pro-
vided to the community of Monterey County. 
This organization has worked for the last fifty 
years to enhance the health and well-being 
and provide a sense of community for home-
bound seniors, disabled adults, and veterans 
on the central coast of California. 
Ms. Sally Judd Griffin, Ms. Vivica Lohr, and 
Ms. Christine Winge have admirably led Meals 
on Wheels of the Monterey Peninsula and 
contributed to the last 50 years of the organi-
zation’s development, growth, and progress. 
These community leaders have positively im-
pacted the lives of countless local community 
members and enhanced the social fabric of 
Monterey Peninsula communities by paving 
the way for other agencies to provide services 
for seniors. 
More than 10 million older Americans face 
hunger each year, and nearly 970,000 of 
those senior citizens reside in California, all of 
whom may be at a greater risk for developing 
a number of debilitating chronic health condi-
tions 
if 
they 
experience 
persistent 
malnourishment and isolation. Powered by the 
commitment and expertise of its staff mem-
bers and the dedication and magnanimity of 
its approximately 525 active volunteers, Meals 
on Wheels of the Monterey Peninsula dem-
onstrated its inestimable value for homebound 
seniors, disabled adults, and veterans during 
the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic. 
In 2021 and in the midst of the pandemic, 
the Home Delivered Meals program provided 
110,800 meals and its corps of volunteers 
generously contributed 21,800 hours for the 
purpose of delivering meals, providing a daily 
wellness check, and connecting with clients 
through shared moments of compassion and 
understanding. 
Madam Speaker, I offer my sincere appre-
ciation to the Meals on Wheels of the Mon-
terey Peninsula for its fifty years of vital serv-
ice to our community members in need.

HONORING GRETCHEN EVANS 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to recognize a courageous veteran, a re-
silient leader, and a selfless Mainer. Com-
mand Sergeant Major Gretchen Evans of 
Brunswick, Maine is one of the most deco-
rated female veterans in American history 
serving in the United States Army for 27 
years. Since enlisting at age 19, CSM Evans 
has served in tours of Kosovo, Bosnia, Soma-
lia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, where she was re-
sponsible for more than 30,000 ground troops. 
Ms. Evans’ honorable dedication to defending 
our country earned her the position of Com-
mand Sergeant Major, the highest non-com-
missioned officer rank in the military. 
In 2006, Command Sergeant Major Evans 
survived a barrage of mortar fire in Afghani-
stan which rendered her deaf and wounded. 
After her combat injury, she quickly found re-
newed vitality by learning to lip read, forging 
relationships with her ‘‘hearing dogs,’’ Aura 
and Rusty, and by proactively reaching out to 
fellow veterans with similar lived experience. 
Today, in Maine, CSM Evans continues to 
give back as an active fundraiser and ambas-
sador for local nonprofits which provide sup-
port services to disabled veterans and which 
seek to prevent veteran experienced social 
isolation and depression. Additionally, CSM 
Evans is a distinguished public speaker who 
advocates for the importance of leadership, 
perseverance, and teamwork, as a part of 
‘‘Women Veterans Speak,’’ a national speak-
er’s bureau. 
When she is not inspiring others to serve, 
CSM Evans pursues her passion for extreme 
sports, running 40 marathons. CSM Evans 
also led UNBROKEN, the first all-mixed abili-
ties team to complete in ‘‘The World’s Tough-
est Race,’’ a 670-kilometer, week-long endur-
ance race held in Fiji. This achievement re-
cently earned her the Pat Tillman Award for 
Service at the 2022 ESPYs, which honors in-
dividuals with both strong connections to 
sports and community leadership. This fall, 
CSM Evans will also be inducted into the U.S. 
Veteran’s Hall of Fame in recognition for her 
outstanding meritorious service to our country. 
I thank Command Sergeant Major Gretchen 
Evans, for her selfless acts of duty to keep 
this Nation safe. The people of Maine are in-
credibly lucky to have her as an advocate, a 
leader, and a community member. I wish her 
the very best and I look forward to seeing her 
continue to thrive.

and impressive careers inspire the next gen-
eration of Pennsylvania athletes striving for 
excellence.

HONORING 
PEMBROKE 
HIGH 
SCHOOL CLASS OF 1972 ON THEIR 
50TH CLASS REUNION 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the Pembroke High 
School Class of 1972 which will be holding its 
50th reunion next week. 
Located in the City of Hampton in Virginia’s 
3rd District, Pembroke High School, originally 
named the George P. Phenix High School, 
was opened in 1940 to educate African Ameri-
cans living in the area. In 1954, the Supreme 
Court issued its landmark Brown v. Board of 
Education ruling which struck down segrega-
tion in public education. The high school was 
moved to a new building in 1962 but was not 
fully integrated until 1967. 
In 1968, George P. Phenix High School was 
renamed Pembroke High School as part of the 
Hampton School Board’s efforts to integrate all 
public schools. The school would continue to 
serve the Hampton area, including students 
from Fort Monroe and Langley Air Force Base, 
until 1980 when Pembroke High School would 
be forced to close its doors due to low enroll-
ment and low capacity. 
Now, the former Pembroke High School 
building continues to serve the Hampton com-
munity by housing the Hampton City Social 
Services office as well as the Hampton Family 
YMCA. 
Madam Speaker, as the Pembroke High 
School Class of 1972 gathers to celebrate a 
truly momentous anniversary, I want to con-
gratulate the members of this historic class 
and the work they have done to serve the City 
of Hampton and the 3rd District of Virginia. I 
thank Pembroke High School Class of 1972 
for their service, and congratulate them on 
their 50-year reunion.

HONORING HARRY BAUMGARTEN 
AND DEEPIKA MURALA 
HON. YVETTE D. CLARKE 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize and congratulate Mr. 
Harry William Baumgarten and Dr. Deepika 
Kennedy Murala on their wedding on June 10, 
2022. This special day is worthy of recognition 
and commendation. 
A 
former 
voting 
rights 
litigator, 
Mr. 
Baumgarten spent three years working in my 
office, where he served as an advisor on for-
eign policy, judiciary, as well as a plethora of 
other matters. Serving in roles as Legislative 
Counsel 
and 
Legislative 
Director, 
Mr. 
Baumgarten showed great skill in leading our 
team to best serve the interests of the people 
in New York’s Ninth Congressional District. 
His dedication to serving this country is worthy 
of praise, and our team is exceptionally grate-
ful for his work and contributions. 
Dr. Deepika Murala is a pediatric critical 
care doctor from Southern India. She has 
been committed to providing health care to un-
derserved communities, both in India and the 
United States. She has shown great dedica-
tion to this cause, and continues to work tire-
lessly supporting this effort. Her current con-
tributions help fill a critical doctor shortage in 
Lewes, Delaware. 
Dr. Murala and Mr. Baumgarten met on 
June 14, 2020, while living in Philadelphia. 
They share a mutual love for traveling and 
cooking, and serve as an example of the char-
acter, capability and professionalism that 
serves our Nation well. Mr. Baumgarten pro-
posed in front of Independence Hall in Decem-
ber of 2021. Independence Hall serves as the 
founding site of this country and additionally, 
the founding site of their marriage. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Deepika and Harry. I join with 
the couple’s family and friends in extending 
my best wishes to them and celebrating this 
wonderful milestone. I wish them happiness 
and blessings in the years to come.

Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I had the pleasure of attending the 2022 
Cape May County Fair, which is a major fund-
raising effort for the 4-H Foundation, the larg-
est youth development program in America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E799 
July 28, 2022 
By all accounts, Dr. Johanson was an even 
better husband, father, colleague, friend and 
faith leader. 
In 2000, Dr. Johanson assumed the position 
of Chairman of Orthopedics at Hahnemann 
University Hospital, where he worked until the 
hospital closed in 2019. There, he became a 
beloved surgeon to thousands of patients and 
mentor to hundreds of residents and medical 
students. Patients, administrators and under-
studies described Dr. Johanson as a tech-
nically gifted surgeon with a compassionate 
bedside manner and down-to-earth demeanor, 
despite being named Philadelphia Magazine 
‘‘Best of Philadelphia’’ for orthopedic surgery 
for more than a decade and winning numer-
ous awards, such as the: T. Campbell Thomp-
son Prize in Orthopedic Surgery from Cornell 
University Medical College; Lewis Wagner 
Award for Best Paper by a resident and the 
Distinguished Alumnus Award from Hospital 
for Special Surgery; and Sir John Charnley 
Award from the Philadelphia Arthritis Founda-
tion. 
According to those that worked closely with 
him, Dr. Johanson was one of the most tech-
nically gifted surgeons they had ever seen— 
machine-like, in fact. According to former resi-
dents Ross Green and Kevin Denehy, in 2014 
a salesman from a company selling robotic 
systems for knee replacements once called on 
Hahnemann. During the sales visit, the rep 
asked him to do a manual one to demonstrate 
how much more precise the robot was than a 
human. Dr. Johanson ‘‘nailed every cut within 
a degree,’’ recalled Denehy. ‘‘The rep threw 
up his hands and said he couldn’t sell him the 
robot—because he was better.’’ He had been 
selling the robot for several years and had 
never seen anything like it. 
Today, we mourn the passing of Dr. Nor-
man Arthur Johanson.

PASTOR RONALD K. MOUTON, SR. 
HON. AL GREEN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, we 
mourn the loss of a pillar in the Houston com-
munity: Reverend Ronald K. Mouton, Sr., Pas-
tor of the East Bethel Missionary Baptist 
Church, who was tragically murdered on Fri-
day, June 24, 2022. Pastor Ronald K. Mouton, 
Sr., was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana, on 
August 2, 1963, to Pastor Roland E. Mouton, 
Sr., and Mary Mouton. Pastor Mouton’s par-
ents impressed upon their son the values of 
service and devotion, setting him on the path 
that would ultimately lead him to East Bethel 
Missionary Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. 
Pastor Ronald Mouton was a proud alumnus 
of the Houston public school system, grad-
uating with honors from the Ross Shaw Ster-
ling High School in 1981. Pastor Mouton went 
on to study at Baylor University before trans-
ferring to Stephen F. Austin State University, 
where he studied Criminal Justice and Busi-
ness Law. In 1983, Ronald K. Mouton, Sr. 
married Ms. Suzanne Poullard, his high school 
sweetheart with whom he attended his Senior 
Prom. His career in the ministry began at the 
urging of his father, who encouraged him to 
preach to those incarcerated at Houston’s 
Prison Farm on Sundays. He did so for more 
than two years. In so doing he developed his 
ministry at the Prison Farm. In August 1991, 
Reverend Mouton, Sr. accepted the call to 
Pastor East Bethel Missionary Baptist Church. 
In the subsequent years, Pastor Mouton’s ser-
mons and preaching style became well known, 
and he established himself as one of Hous-
ton’s most renowned pastors. As his promi-
nence grew, Pastor Mouton became an area 
coordinator for the WHW Expository Preaching 
Conference, and he also received an honorary 
Doctorate Degree from Elbon Solutions of 
Studies in Apple Valley California. Pastor 
Mouton’s 
explosive 
sermons 
continuously 
stressed the importance of fostering commu-
nity with love for each other. The East Bethel 
Missionary Baptist Church declared the month 
of August as PASTOR MOUTON month as an 
expression of appreciation for his stellar serv-
ice to the community. Pastor Mouton’s tragic 
passing is an immense loss, as we will never 
again experience his inspiring oratory. He 
faithfully served East Bethel Missionary Baptist 
Church for almost 32 years, the longest tenure 
of any Pastor in the Church’s history. Pastor 
Mouton, Sr. is survived by his wife of 38 years 
Suzanne Poullard Mouton; his brothers, Pastor 
Roland Mouton Jr., John Edward Mouton, and 
Wilton Enard; his sister Jacqueline Mouton 
Factor; four children, Ronald Keith Mouton Jr., 
Ryan Keith Mouton, Glenn Edward Poullard, 
and Tamika Shante Johnson; ten grand-
children; and a loving and heartbroken com-
munity. He will be dearly missed.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
SHIPLEY 
HON. BLAINE LUETKEMEYER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of a great man who 
served his country valiantly during World War 
II. Mr. James Shipley sadly passed away on 
July 21st at the age of 99. At only 19 years 
of age, Mr. Shipley made the decision to go to 
his local recruiting station and serve his coun-
try during a time of war. Little did Mr. Shipley 
know this decision would have him in one of 
the most respected military organizations from 
World War II which would pave the way for Af-
rican Americans service in the armed forces. 
Prior to his enlistment Mr. Shipley had 
worked as a mechanic. With that experience 
he was selected to serve as a mechanic for 
military aircraft. He completed his basic train-
ing at the Tuskegee Institute, the exact site 
selected to train the primarily black squadrons 
that would later be known as the Tuskegee 
Airmen. 
Once his preparatory training had com-
pleted, he and the rest of his squadron 
boarded ships bound for overseas service. In 
January of 1944, Mr. Shipley was assigned to 
the 332nd Fighter Group based in Italy. For 21 
months, he and his fellow mechanics kept 
many aircrafts such as the P–39s, P–40s, P– 
47s, and P–51s in top condition. During this 
time the Tuskegee Pilots flew nearly twice as 
many missions as their fellow pilots due to the 
shortage of pilots in the 332nd Fighter Group. 
The group escorted over 200 bombing mis-
sions and during that time they logged over 
15,500 sorties which destroyed over 400 
enemy aircraft and ammunition sites. 
After the Surrender of Germany, Mr. Shipley 
would soon return home to Tipton, Missouri 
where he spent time at various jobs until he 
became a mechanic for a local electric coop-
erative until he retired in 1985. In 2007, he, 
alongside other Tuskegee Airmen received 
their replicas of the Congressional Gold Medal 
for their valiant efforts in defeating the Axis 
powers in World War II. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring 
an American hero, Mr. James Shipley, for the 
life he lived and the thousands of lives he 
changed.

CELEBRATING AURORA’S PUERTO 
RICAN 
CULTURAL 
COUNCIL’S 
50TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. BILL FOSTER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. FOSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the Aurora Puerto Rican Cultural 
Council’s 50 years of incredible service to the 
Aurora community, as well as the leadership 
of Ms. Iris Miller, board president. 
Through two years of loss and hardship due 
to the COVID–19 pandemic, the Council, 
under Ms. Miller’s excellent leadership, man-
aged to maintain their position as a pillar of 
the Aurora community. The council has contin-
ued promoting their Puerto Rican heritage 
through civic activities and cultural education 
despite the circumstances. Today, as we cele-
brate both the return of the Puerto Rican fes-
tival and the 50th anniversary of the Council, 
this organization continues to serve their com-
munity through the $20,000 in multicultural 
educational scholarships they are awarding. 
These achievements have happened under 
the guidance of Iris Miller, Board President of 
the Aurora Puerto Rican Council. Born and 
raised in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, Ms. Miller has 
shown exemplary leadership and commitment 
to the Council since she began her term in 
2017. Ms. Miller is an avid community servant 
and has consistently gone above and beyond 
to provide humanitarian aid to Puerto Rico and 
Mexico during recent natural disasters. In Au-
rora, she has acted as a supporter and volun-
teer for multiple non-profit organizations, as 
well as the City of Aurora.

HONORING SALUD PARA LA 
GENTE 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Salud Para La Gente and its 
healthcare staff for their contributions and ef-
forts during the coronavirus pandemic. 
Salud Para La Gente (Salud) has provided 
accessible healthcare to the central coast of 
California since its founding in 1978. What 
started as a single clinic providing healthcare 
to farmworkers has grown to 10 clinics on the 
Central Coast that serve a community of 
28,000 people. During the pandemic, Salud 
proved their preparedness and capability by 
continuing to provide healthcare and services 
to the Central Coast. 
The Incident Command team provided ac-
cess to healthcare and specialized COVID–19 
care every day of the week within the respec-
tive communities of Watsonville, South Santa 
Cruz County, and North Monterey County. Its 
COVID–19 care is extensive and comprehen-
sive, including testing and tracing for almost 
23,000 people and the administration of 
47,000 COVID–19 vaccines through its 175 
vaccine clinics. Salud ensures that it serves its 
community with its unwavering commitment to 
providing resources to every community mem-
ber, regardless of background or financial sta-
tus. Notably, it also offers the only infusion 
therapy clinic in Santa Cruz County to vulner-
able and immunocompromised individuals in-
fected with COVID–19 to prevent hospitaliza-
tion. 
Salud’s dedicated team and numerous part-
nerships with local organizations have pro-
vided comprehensive COVID–19 care through-
out the pandemic. With its partnerships, Salud 
provided proper resources to our Central 
Coast communities, focusing on important pa-
tient and community messaging, and distrib-
uting over $5.5 million in financial support. 
Salud Para La Gente’s prominence and im-
portance in our community cannot be under-
stated. In 2016, Salud became the only Medi- 
Cal Women’s health provider in South County, 
and in 2017, was awarded Silver by the Cen-
tral California Alliance for Health for its 
Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information 
Set from Santa Cruz County. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize the great contributions and efforts of the 
Salud Para La Gente team. I personally ex-
tended my gratitude to its dedicated essential 
workers who have made many sacrifices to 
protect our communities’ health.

40TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MEXI-
CAN 
FOLKLORIC 
DANCE 
COM-
PANY OF CHICAGO 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 28, 2022 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
want to honor the Mexican Folkloric Dance 
Company of Chicago (MDFC), the oldest 
Mexican dance institution in our city, as it 
celebrates its 40th Anniversary this month. 
Folkloric dance refers to a dance style origi-
nating in Mexico, reflecting a diverse array of 
regions and states, blending a variety of tech-
niques, tempos, music, and cultures to 
produce an art form as vibrant as the people 
of Mexico. 
Though Mexican folkloric dance is an art 
form that can be traced back to the ceremo-
nial and social dance practices of indigenous 
communities, it also has multicultural influ-
ences, including Spanish, French and Carib-
bean, as well as from music and dance styles 
brought by immigrants from Africa, Asia, and 
other regions. 
Folkloric dances are an expression of Mexi-
can, Mexican American, and regional pride. It 
has served as a measure of counter-colo-
nialism and. storytelling, as dances often de-
pict symbols, events, and other elements 
unique to the region that they originate from. 
These roots of pride and expression are 
what inspired the creation of the Mexican 
Folkloric Dance Company of Chicago in 1982, 
when two prominent community folk dance 
groups, Nuevo Ideal and Alma de Mexico 
merged after performing in the very first Ethnic 
Heritage Festival at the 1981 Illinois State 
Fair. 
Since 1982 the Mexican Folkloric Dance 
Company of Chicago has remained an integral 
part of our community. In its 40-year history, 
the group has provided free. dance education 
to hundreds of children, youth, and young 
adults across the city, providing the oppor-
tunity to connect with their Mexican heritage 
through the art of folkloric dance. 
In addition to providing young people with 
the opportunity to connect, the Mexican Folk-
loric Dance Company of Chicago has cap-
tivated audiences across the state, nation, and 
globe. They have performed for Presidents in 
both the U.S. and Mexico, and at major events 
like the World Cup, the Pan American Games, 
and Latin Grammys, and alongside performers 
like Juan Gabriel, Pepe Aguilar, and others. 
I commend the Mexican Folkloric Dance 
Company of Chicago for its contributions to 
our city’s cultural life, and for their consistent 
engagement of young people into the history, 
culture, and art of Mexico, all of which form 
the heart of folkloric dance. Their captivating 
and vibrant performances serve as a testa-
ment to the flourishing Mexican Chicago com-
munity, and to the incredible presence it has 
and will continue to have in the city, state, and 
across the Nation. Let’s celebrate its 40th an-
niversary.
