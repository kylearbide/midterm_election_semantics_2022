RECOGNIZING 
CORINNE 
MILLER 
AND 
HER 
SERVICE 
TO 
THE 
SOUTH FLORIDA COMMUNITY 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, on behalf of 
myself and Congresswoman Frankel, I rise 
today to honor Corinne Miller for her years of 
volunteerism and her dedication to her work 
on behalf of voters. Corinne Miller was born 
on April 1, 1931, and is a graduate of New 
York University. She lived most of her life in 
Bloomfield and West Orange, New Jersey, be-
fore moving to Palm Beach County, Florida, in 
2000. Corinne was married to Murray Miller 
and has two children, Joyce Rudin and Lois 
Miller. 
Corinne Miller has been a grassroots activist 
since she graduated college and has spent a 
great deal of her time volunteering for the PTA 
and the Democratic Party. She has spent a 
great deal of time dedicated to the League of 
Women Voters and continues to remain active 
with voter engagement. Corinne is well known 
throughout 
Florida 
for 
spearheading 
the 
League of Women Voter’s nonpartisan Voter 
Guide, which is distributed throughout Palm 
Beach County. 
Corinne’s work on behalf of voters has re-
ceived lots of recognition. In Essex County, 
New Jersey, she received the Democrat of the 
Year Award and she has received the Susan 
B. Anthony award as the Outstanding Feminist 
of the Year from Palm Beach County’s Na-
tional Organization of Women. Corinne Miller 
spends her time as a public speaker in south 
Florida and remains extremely involved with 
get-out-the-vote efforts for 35 precincts in 
Boca Raton and Highland Beach, Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I ask our colleagues to 
join us in recognizing Corinne Miller and her 
service to the south Florida community.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JULIAN 
CAMPENNI 
ON 
HIS 
INDUCTION 
INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, current coach, 
and northeastern Pennsylvania native Julian 
Campenni. Julian was inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports all of Fame in 2020 for 
his distinct athletic achievements in the sport 
of football. He and his fellow inductees will be 
honored at a reception this spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the State of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
Julian had a standout athletic career at Wy-
oming Area High School as part of the football 
and track and field teams. He served as the 
varsity football team captain, and for his ef-
forts on the field, he earned Wyoming Valley 
Conference Division II MVP honors and was a 
Big 33 All-Star Defensive Lineman and a 
member of the WNEP Channel 16 Dream 
Team. He was a Chesapeake Bowl All-Star, a 
Times Leader All-Wyoming Valley Conference 
Defensive Lineman, Second Team All-State, a 
Citizens Voice All-Wyoming Valley Conference 
Defensive Lineman, and a Big 33 Selection. 
He was named to the Northeastpafootball.com 
Wyoming Valley Conference First Team offen-
sive 
and 
defensive 
line 
and 
Easternfootball.com Small School All-State 
Team defensive line. 
Julian continued his athletic and academic 
career at the University of Connecticut. He 
was a 4-year letterman and served as team 
captain in 2015, playing 47 career games with 
38 starts. He was recognized as a member of 
the All-American Athletic Conference Second 
Team. His athletic prowess attracted the atten-
tion of the NFL, and he was invited to attend 
Rookie Mini Camp with the Indianapolis Colts. 
Following his career on the field, Julian re-
turned to his alma mater, Wyoming Area, to 
begin his coaching career on the defensive 
line. He spent the 2016 season with the War-
riors and helped lead the team to a con-
ference championship before moving to Bos-
ton, Massachusetts, to attend Boston College, 
where he studied sports management and 
worked as a graduate assistant with the foot-
ball team’s offensive line. 
In 2018, after earning his master’s degree, 
Julian accepted a defensive line position with 
the Bowling Green State University football 
team in Ohio where he still coaches today. 
It is an honor to recognize Julian on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

RAY RAHNE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ray Rahne, who after sev-
eral decades of service to the International As-
sociation of Fire Fighters recently retired as 
the 9th District Vice President. Ray’s dedica-
tion to fire safety and rescue for the State of 
Colorado has made a significant impact which 
will last for years to come. 
Ray began his firefighting career after 
proudly serving our country in the United 
States Marine Corps, where he saw combat 
action in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969. He 
joined the Littleton Fire Department and Local 
2086 on September 13, 1972 and served in 
roles including Lieutenant, Captain and Bat-
talion Chief. He also served as a paramedic 
for 20 years after being one of the first 12 cer-
tified paramedics in the State of Colorado. 
Ray has served his communities in the best 
and worst of times including by serving as the 
Initial Incident Commander during the Col-
umbine shooting in 1999 and later as Oper-
ations Chief for the remainder of the incident. 
Through his work with other groups, he has 
created numerous partnerships and helped im-
prove outcomes and safety in the fire and res-
cue community and the quality of life for all 
Coloradans. 
Throughout his career, Ray was best known 
for his passion for service and passion for his 
fellow firefighters. He has been a member in 
good standing of Local 2086 in Littleton, Colo-
rado for over 46 years and was the President 
of Local 2086 for 16 of those years. He served 
as Vice President of the Colorado Professional 
Fire Fighters (CPFF) for 7 years and as Vice 
President to the Colorado AFL–CIO for 3 
years. Ray also served as Secretary/Treasurer 
to the CPFF for over 24 years. 
Ray is a beloved and devoted husband and 
a loving father. I appreciate his decades of 
service to our community and I wish him all 
the best in his retirement.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
JARRETT HORNISH FOR WINNING 
THE 
DIVISION 
III 
WRESTLING 
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Jarrett Hornish of Wayne Trace High School 
has represented his school ably on his way to 
achieving the Division III State wrestling title. 
Jarrett overcame the challenges posed by in-
tense competition in his effort to win the Divi-
sion III State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State championship, Jarrett 
Hornish defeated his opponent in the finals of 
the 126-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. He has achieved an impressive sea-
son record bringing pride to his school and 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Jarrett Hornish 
of Wayne Trace High School. On behalf of the 
people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud 
to recognize this great achievement.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

POLICE 
DE-
PARTMENT 2018 OFFICER OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to congratulate Lieutenant Todd R. King upon 
earning the Springettsbury Township Police 
Department 2018 Officer of the Year award. 
Due to exemplary performance and diversity 
of assignments, Lt. King exemplified sound 
decision-making, tireless dedication, and out-
standing judgment while maintaining lasting 
and meaningful relationships within the depart-
ment and the citizens he serves. 
The Officer of the Year designation is 
awarded to those who demonstrate a high 
level of resourcefulness, reliability, and leader-
ship in daily assignments. Over the course of 
his career, Lt. King has continued to rise 
through the ranks of the department—in no 
small part due to his dedication to serve and 
desire to earn the respect of his fellow officers 
and staff. 
In 2018, Officer King assumed the primary 
role of evaluating and overhauling department 
policy and procedures, in addition to procuring 
and implementing new equipment to bring the 
department up to speed technologically. His 
knowledge and resourcefulness played a key 
role in the quality work produced daily by the 
department. 
The breathtaking level of responsibility dele-
gated to Lt. King also was notable. His daily 
assignments play a pivotal role in ensuring 
that ‘‘rank and file’’ had whatever was needed 
to fulfill their critical duties. He continues to be 
an invaluable asset to the department, and I 
am proud to recognize his achievements here 
today. 
For exemplary performance, assumption of 
numerous assignments, commitment to the 
mission, 
and 
tireless 
service 
to 
the 
Springettsbury Township Police Department 
and the citizens it serves, I’m honored to rec-
ognize Lieutenant Todd R. King as the Depart-
ment’s 2018 Officer of the Year.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BOONE COUNTY COUNCILMAN 
STEVE JACOB 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of a dedicated public servant 
and constituent, Steve Jacob. Steve passed 
away peacefully on Wednesday, March 17, 
2021, surrounded by his family. 
Steve Jacob was born on March 16, 1947, 
to parents William and Marietta. He grew up 
on the family farm in Jasonville, Indiana, going 
on to attend Purdue University. Upon gradua-
tion, Steve began his career at Indiana Bell, 
working his way to the role of vice president 
of Ameritech. Through his knowledge and ex-
perience, Steve served as a Congressional 
Fellow here in Washington, D.C., working for 
the telecom industry. 
Though Steve had many commendable ex-
periences in his career, he is perhaps best 
known in my district for his 20-plus years in 
public service. Steve served on the Boone 
County Council and at the time of his passing 
was the president of the council. His work on 
numerous boards and committees is to be 
commended. I am confident that the impact he 
made in public office will be felt for many 
years to come. 
I extend my deepest condolences to his 
wife, Janet; his children Jeff, Jill, and Chris; 
and to the rest of his family and friends.

Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Addison 
Lenchner for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Addison Lenchner is a student at Arvada K– 
8 and received this award because her deter-
mination and hard work have allowed her to 
overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Addison 
Lenchner is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Addison Lenchner for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt she will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of her fu-
ture accomplishments. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE HISTORIC 
TAX CREDIT GROWTH AND OP-
PORTUNITY ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Historic Tax Credit Growth 
and Opportunity Act of 2021. This legislation 
passed the House last session in Title III of 
Division M of the Moving Forward Act (H.R. 2, 
116th Cong.). It would bring relief to historic 
rehabilitation 
projects 
impacted 
by 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic while also improving the 
credit for smaller projects and expanding the 
number of projects eligible to receive the cred-
it. 
Since its inception in 1976, the Historic Tax 
Credit (HTC) has incentivized private sector 
investment in rehabilitating historic buildings. 
The HTC has attracted approximately $173 
billion in private capital in the last 45 years, 
helping to rehabilitate and revitalize commu-
nities. More than 45,000 buildings have been 
rehabilitated using the credit, creating nearly 3 
million jobs. Unlike many other tax incentives, 
HTC projects spur enough economic develop-
ment to return money to the Treasury. In 2019 
the National Park Service reported that the 
HTC has generated $38.1 billion in federal tax 
revenue from $32.9 billion in tax credits. 
The Historic Tax Credit Growth and Oppor-
tunity Act of 2021 first recognizes the chal-
lenges that historic rehabilitation projects have 
faced during the COVID–19 pandemic and 
provides a temporary increase in the credit 
value to address market volatility and projects’ 
difficulty in accessing capital. The legislation 
also increases the credit value for small 
projects, which are often more difficult to fi-
nance. 
Finally, 
HTC-GO 
makes 
several 
changes to the structure of the credit to make 
more buildings eligible for the credit and allow 
for the credit to be more easily paired with the 
Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
in the House and Senate to enact this legisla-
tion in a comprehensive infrastructure package 
this year.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
PAUL 
J. 
MAHER FOR HIS LIFETIME OF 
SERVICE 
TO 
NORTHEASTERN 
PENNSYLVANIA 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of public 
servant, community leader, and United States 
Army veteran Paul J. Maher. Paul peacefully 
passed away at the age of 87 on February 19, 
2021. 
Paul was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsyl-
vania, to Paul W. and Elizabeth Zwiebel 
Maher. He graduated from Mary’s High 
School, and he remained actively involved 
with his alma mater as an alumnus, coordi-
nating class reunions. He also attended 
Wilkes College and Wyoming Seminary. 
Answering the call to serve his country, Paul 
enlisted in the United States Army and served 
during the Korean conflict. Before being dis-
charged as a sergeant, he served at Fort 
Bragg, North Carolina, with the 81st Chemical 
Group attached to the 82nd Airborne, holding 
the positions of company administrator and 
desk sergeant. After the Army, he had suc-
cessful careers in banking and sales. 
In 1971, Paul began his political career as 
the Coordinator of Federal Funds for the City 
of Wilkes-Barre where he worked closely with 
the late Congressman Dan Flood. His service 
to the city was instrumental in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Agnes in 1972. He attended flood 
recovery meetings and helped set up trailer 
parks for displaced residents, and he was a 
founding member and chairman of the South 
Wilkes-Barre Action Committee. In 1976, the 
late chairman of the Commissioner Board, 
F.C. Wideman, Jr., appointed Paul as the first 
Luzerne County Budget and Personnel Direc-
tor where he oversaw allocations of funds and 
started a program to engage service clubs and 
women’s organizations in the budget process. 
In 1985, he began his 26-year career work-
ing with Congressman Paul Kanjorski of Penn-
sylvania’s 11th Congressional District as a 
field representative, serving as a liaison for all 
unions and managing small business inquiries. 
He was a well-known presence in the commu-
nity, representing the Congressman at com-
munity events. 
Paul was generous with his time and active 
in South Wilkes-Barre throughout his life. He 
volunteered at organizations like the St. Vin-
cent de Paul Kitchen and the Wilkes-Barre 
Catholic Youth Center and served on councils 
and authorities such as the Wyoming Valley 
Sanitary Authority and the Wilkes-Barre Park-
ing Authority. He was a member of many com-
munity and social clubs, including the Wilkes- 
Barre and Hanover Township American Le-
gions, the Sons of St. Patrick, and the Don-
egal Society. Following his interest in politics, 
he served as Democratic State committeeman 
for four decades. Paul organized and coached 
football for youth and high school teams, and 
he was inducted into the Wyoming Valley Box-
ing Hall of Fame in 1998 as a boxing judge. 
Paul was married to his wife, Judith Delong, 
for 18 years, and he took great joy connecting 
with his extended family. Paul dedicated his 
time and energy to the betterment of his com-
munity and his county, and I am humbled to 
honor the life of this true public servant.

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA

Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Carson Meyer of Archbold High School has

Carson overcame the challenges posed by in-
tense competition in his effort to win the Divi-
sion III State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State championship, Carson 
Meyer defeated his opponent in the finals of 
the 182-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. He has achieved an impressive sea-
son record bringing pride to his school and 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Carson Meyer 
of Archbold High School. On behalf of the 
people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA NATIONAL GUARD 
COMMANDING 
GENERAL 
RESI-
DENCY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia National 
Guard Commanding General Residency Act, 
which would require the Commanding General 
of the D.C. National Guard to reside in the 
District of Columbia, just as States and terri-
tories can require that the top official of their 
National Guard reside within their State or ter-
ritory. 
The D.C. National Guard is a Federal entity. 
Currently, the Commanding General of the 
D.C. National Guard is not required to reside 
in the District. Congress has justifiably re-
quired that certain Federal officials reside in 
the jurisdiction they serve to ensure in-depth 
knowledge of the unique issues and chal-
lenges residents and these Federal officials 
face. Additionally, the Mayor of D.C., unlike 
the Governors of the States and territories, 
cannot deploy the National Guard, making 
residency of the Commanding General of the 
National Guard that much more important, 
though my District of Columbia National Guard 
Home Rule Act (H.R. 657) would give the 
Mayor the authority to deploy the D.C. Na-
tional Guard. The appointment of the Com-
manding General of the D.C. National Guard 
is made by the President, not the Mayor, 
whereas the top official of the National Guards 
in the States and territories are usually ap-
pointed by the Governor. All of these are com-
pelling reasons why the Commanding General 
of the D.C. Guard should be required to be a 
D.C. resident. 
This bill follows in the footsteps of several 
other bills that I have introduced that would re-
quire Federal officials serving D.C. exclusively 
to reside in the District. For example, my Dis-
trict of Columbia Federal Officials Residency 
Equality Act (H.R. 3785, 116th Congress) 
would require the Federal district court judges, 
Federal circuit court judges, U.S. Attorneys 
and U.S. Marshals for the District to live in 
D.C. I have also previously introduced a bill 
(H.R. 4184, 116th Congress) that would re-
quire the Director of the Court Services and 
Offender Supervision Agency for the District of 
Columbia and the Director of the District of 
Columbia Pretrial Services Agency to reside in 
the District. 
With the nomination of the current D.C. Na-
tional Guard Commanding General, Major 
General William J. Walker, to be the House 
Sergeant at Arms, this bill is more timely than 
ever. Moreover, the attack of the U.S. Capitol 
on January 6, 2021, and the events at Lafay-
ette Square on June 1, 2020, are prime exam-
ples of why this bill is so important. Residents 
of the District would feel at least somewhat 
more confident in the D.C. National Guard if 
the Commanding General were required to be 
a D.C. resident. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

BASKETBALL 
HON. JOHN JOYCE

Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the Bishop 
Guilfoyle Catholic High School girls basketball

This victory marks Bishop Guilfoyle Catho-
lic’s seventh PIAA championship in girls bas-
ketball and first state championship since

CONGRATULATING JAMES C. DUFF 
ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE 
OFFICE 
OF 
THE U.S. COURTS 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today, 
along with Representative HANK
JOHNSON, 
chair of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellec-
tual Property, and the Internet to honor and 
congratulate James Duff, who recently retired 
from his position as Director of the Administra-
tive Office of the U.S. Courts. In his role as Di-
rector, he also served as Secretary of the Ju-
dicial Conference of the United States, the 
principal policy-making body of the federal Ju-
diciary. The Supreme Court and our federal 
court system are a cornerstone of our democ-
racy; the third branch of our government is 
tasked with rendering impartial justice through 
interpreting and applying the laws that we in 
Congress pass, and of course, the Constitu-
tion. The judges and Justices who have this 
enormous responsibility rely on the Adminis-
trative Office to set them up for success, and 
this is no small undertaking. During his more 
than eleven years of service, Director Duff 
guided the courts through government shut-
downs and the COVID–19 pandemic among 
other challenges, dedicating his efforts to en-
suring that our federal courts have the re-
sources and support they need to faithfully ful-
fill their constitutional role as the third branch 
of government. 
Even prior to his role as Director, Mr. Duff 
had a long history of public service with the 
courts, particularly the Supreme Court. He 
was an assistant to Chief Justice Warren E. 
Burger while studying at Georgetown Law. 
From 1996–2000, he was a counselor/admin-
istrative assistant to Chief Justice William H. 
Rehnquist. In that role, he was the Court’s liai-
son to Congress, the executive branch, and 
various state and federal organizations in-
volved with the administration of justice and 
assisted the Chief Justice in his duties as 
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution. 
Besides his work for the courts, Director 
Duff has been active in the community and 
educating the next generation of lawyers. He 
has served as the chairman of the Supreme 
Court Fellows Commission, a board member 
of the Supreme Court Historical Society, and 
an adjunct faculty member at Georgetown Uni-
versity, teaching constitutional law and civil lib-
erties. In 2012, he was named to the Univer-
sity of Kentucky Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame 
and was the recipient of the Georgetown En-
tertainment and Media Law Achievement 
Award. In 2014, Director Duff was appointed 
to Georgetown Law’s Board of Visitors and 
was named the Peter Mullen Professor of 
Law. 
Upon appointment from Chief Justice Rob-
erts, Director Duff twice served as the Director 
of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, 
from 2006 to 2011, and from 2015 to 2021. 
About his tenure, the Chief Justice shared the 
following congratulatory words which are worth 
reiterating here: 
Jim Duff has provided invaluable service 
to the Judiciary during his first term as Di-
rector from 2006 to 2011 and his second term 
from 2015 to the present. During these peri-
ods, he has provided superb judgment in ad-
dressing a broad range of issues. Among his 
many accomplishments, he has resolved 
budgetary challenges, implemented work-
place conduct reforms, introduced new tech-
nology, strengthened and improved the au-
diting and oversight of the Judicial Branch’s 
financial management, and—most recently— 
ensured that the courts continue to operate 
effectively in the face of the nationwide pan-
demic. As much as I appreciate his many 
contributions, I understand his desire to 
begin a new phase of his life. On behalf of the 
Judiciary, I thank Jim for his leadership. 
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
does critical work to help ensure the nation’s 
federal courts remain fair, efficient, inde-
pendent, and impartial. We thank and con-
gratulate Director Duff for his over eleven-year 
tenure as the head of that office and for his 
work with Congress during that time. This 
work has included securing critical appropria-
tions for the judiciary, such as emergency 
funding during the recent coronavirus pan-
demic, ensuring that the law establishes court-
house locations and district divisions that re-
flect the needs of the community and judiciary, 
helping to ensure the safety of judges by se-
curing legislation, the Court Security Improve-
ment Act of 2007, which was directed at co-
ordinating the work of the U.S. Marshals with 
the Judicial Conference and imposing criminal 
penalties designed to protect judges, wit-
nesses, and others involved in court pro-
ceedings, and, in separate legislation, pro-
viding that sensitive information in financial 
disclosures can be redacted. We also com-
mend Director Duff’s commitment to public 
service and teaching throughout his career. 
After all of these accomplishments, we wish 
Director Duff the best in the next chapter in 
his life along with a fulfilling and rewarding re-
tirement. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE LATE 
GLENN FREY ON HIS INDUCTION 
INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete and northeastern 
Pennsylvania native Glenn Frey. Glenn was 
inducted into the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame in 2020 for his distinct athletic 
achievements in the sport of football. He and 
his fellow inductees will be honored at a re-
ception this spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the state of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
Glenn played football for Tunkhannock High 
School from 1927 to 1930 where he was de-
scribed as the backbone of the team. He also 
excelled as pitcher on the baseball team, lead-
ing Tunkhannock to a county championship in 
1931. 
After graduating high school in 1931, Glenn 
continued his athletic and academic career at 
Temple University in Philadelphia. At Temple, 
he played for legendary Coach Glenn ‘‘Pop’’ 
Warner. During his collegiate career, he was 
named an All-American. In 1935, he played 
quarterback against Tulane University in the 
first Sugar Bowl in front of a crowd of 20,000 
people at Tulane Stadium. Going into post- 
season play, Temple was undefeated and 
sought to defend their record. As starting 
quarterback, Glenn threw the first touchdown 
in Sugar Bowl history to Danny Testa in the 
first quarter of the game. Despite the Owls 
leading 14–0 at halftime, the home team 
pulled ahead to beat Temple 20–14. 
Glenn’s talent attracted the attention of the 
NFL, and he began his professional career 
with the Philadelphia Eagles. Under coach 
Bert Bell, who would later be named the com-
missioner of the NFL, Glenn played quarter-
back, blocking back, and defensive back for 
two seasons. After retiring from professional 
football, Glenn took a position with Sunoco. 
He died in 1980 at the age of 67. 
It is an honor to recognize Glenn on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

OF THE YEAR 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA

Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to congratulate Officer Adam Farnsler upon 
earning the Springettsbury Township Police 
Department (STPD) 2017 Officer of the Year 
award. 
Officer Farnsler started his career with the 
STPD in January 2016, after serving two 
years with the Southern Regional Police De-
partment. From the very first day of field train-
ing, it was obvious that Officer Farnsler would 
give his best every day. He was motivated to 
learn and get involved with all types of police 
work. 
In 2017, Officer Farnsler was assigned to 
the night shift and spent the entire year in this 
position. He was relentless in his efforts to pa-
trol Springettsbury Township and enforce the 
laws of the Commonwealth. He focused on all 
forms of violations—from DUIs to drug offense 
to personal injury crime. Officer Farnsler’s ef-
forts resulted in a shift-leading performance on 
felony and misdemeanor arrests, non-traffic 
arrests, youth aid panel referrals, and total in-
cidents handled. Officer Farnsler led the night 
shift with a total of 160 arrests, as well as led 
the department in officer-initiated reports. This 
again shows his level of motivation and dedi-
cation to duty. He conducted all of this while 
still handling an even share of crashes, traffic 
citations, and traffic warnings. 
In a notable 2017 arrest, Officer Farnsler 
observed the occupants of a vehicle acting 
suspiciously. He began to follow the vehicle, 
which resulted in the driver turning off his 
lights to avoid police. Officer Farnsler con-
ducted a traffic stop and was provided a false 
name by the driver. His diligent pursuit of the 
truth resulted in his discovery of a firearm with 
an obliterated serial number and arrest of the 
subject for multiple offenses. 
Officer Farnsler’s yearly stats only touch the 
surface of his law enforcement performance. 
He also focuses on one of the most important 
areas of policing—community policing. He as-
sists citizens during myriad and numerous 
sensitive and emotional situations. Officer 
Farnsler’s efforts were commended in writing 
by at least three different citizens writing to the 
department to describe how Officer Farnsler 
positively affected their lives during a sensitive 
or emotional situation. This is on top of known 
instances of Officer Farnsler randomly paying 
for someone’s food or drink just to be nice or 
helpful. His motivation to find criminal viola-
tions is matched only by his motivation to sup-
port the community of Springettsbury Town-
ship. 
Throughout calendar year 2017, Officer 
Farnsler continuously performed at a high 
level. He maintained a heavy workload that in-
cluded numerous self-initiated arrests for seri-
ous criminal and traffic investigations, in addi-
tion to his normal calls for service that he han-
dled in an outstanding and diligent manner. 
Officer Farnsler continually investigated each 
complaint thoroughly. He did all this while con-
tinually showing compassion and empathy. 
For exemplary performance, tireless dedica-
tion to the mission, and for setting the stand-
ard for all to follow, I’m honored to congratu-
late Officer Adam Farnsler for earning the title 
of the 2017 Springettsbury Township Police 
Department 2017 Officer of the Year.

RECOGNIZING JULIA STRINE 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Julia Strine on 
winning a state championship in the 2021 
PIAA Class 3A swimming contest. 
Julia is a senior at Shippensburg High 
School. She won the girls 100-yard Breast-
stroke with a time of 1:02.33 winning by just 
.29 seconds. Julia showed true determination 
and grit to win the gold medal. Prior to winning 
this prestigious award, she placed seventh at 
the PIAA swimming championships her fresh-
man year. Her desire to win a gold medal was 
spurred by this experience. Continued deter-
mination has led her to be named Female Ath-
lete of the Winter in the Waynesboro Record 
Herald. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsyl-
vania, I congratulate Julia Strine on a suc-
cessful season and wish her every continued 
success as she pursues her education and

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF AUSTIN 
KOHLHOFER FOR WINNING THE 
DIVISION III WRESTLING STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Austin Kohlhofer of Delta High School has 
represented his school ably on his way to 
achieving the Division III State wrestling title. 
Austin overcame the challenges posed by in-
tense competition in his effort to win the Divi-
sion III State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State championship, Austin 
Kohlhofer defeated his opponent in the finals 
of the 220-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. He has achieved an impressive sea-
son record bringing pride to his school and 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Austin 
Kohlhofer of Delta High School. On behalf of 
the people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am

HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER 
MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL 
FRANK KELLEY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Former 
Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley. His 
contributions to the State of Michigan and to 
our nation are worthy of commendation. 
Frank Kelley was born in Detroit, Michigan 
in 1924. The first in his family to graduate 
from college, he attended the University of De-
troit where he earned his law degree and then 
moved to Alpena, Michigan to serve as city at-
torney. He was appointed to the position of 
Michigan Attorney General by Governor John 
Swainson in 1961. The longest serving attor-
ney general in Michigan history, he served for 
thirty-seven years under five different Gov-
ernors, both Republicans and Democrats. He 
often recalled what U.S. Attorney General 
Robert Kertnedy told him shortly before his 
appointment to the office of Michigan Attorney 
General: ‘‘Reach out against injustice wher-
ever you see it and protect the public.’’ He 
truly was the people’s lawyer. 
During his tenure as Michigan Attorney 
General, he was known for his leadership on 
the issues of the environment, civil rights, and 
consumer protection. He fought back against 
utility companies and powerful corporations re-
gardless of if it could damage his political ca-
reer. In the early 1960s, when it remained un-
popular to advocate for racial justice, he pros-
ecuted a White gang for the killing of a young 
Black man named Grady Little. From com-
bating high interest rates and price fixing to 
protecting our natural resources, he was re-
lentless in the pursuit of justice for all 
Michiganders. A chamion for the environment 
even in retirement, he was there in January 
2020 when Governor Whitmer and Attorney 
General Dana Nessel announced a lawsuit 
against seventeen chemical companies ac-
cused of being responsible for PFAS contami-
nation. The lasting impact of his work on the 
State of Michigan and its citizens is impossible 
to measure. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of former 
Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelley, a 
friend and mentor to many. He has honorably 
served our State and this country. Our 
thoughts are with the Kelley family and the 
people of the State of Michigan at this time as 
they mourn the loss of the eternal general.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
KATHY 
GOERINGER ON HER INDUCTION 
INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, official, 
and northeastern Pennsylvania native Kathy 
Goeringer. Kathy was inducted into the 
Luzerne County Sports Hall of Fame in 2020 
for her distinct athletic achievements in the 
sports of basketball, volleyball, softball, track 
and field, and golf. She and her fellow induct-
ees will be honored at a reception this spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the State of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
Kathy is the daughter of Raymond and 
Nancy Goeringer. As a student athlete at 
Tunkhannock High School, she was a varsity 
starter on the school’s championship basket-
ball and volleyball teams. She set scoring 
records of 39 points and 26 rebounds for sin-
gle game performances, and she was named 
to 
the 
Susquehanna 
League 
Basketball 
Coaches All-Star Team 2 years in a row. In 
1974, she helped start the school’s track and 
field team which went undefeated three sea-
sons in a row and won three district team and 
individual titles. In shot put, Kathy set a school 
record and competed in local, State, and re-
gional Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) competi-
tions, winning five gold medals at the local 
and State levels. 
After graduating high school in 1976, Kathy 
continued her athletic career on the basketball 
team at Slippery Rock State College in Slip-
pery Rock, Pennsylvania. She left the team 
after 2 years to become the first female sports 
editor of the student newspaper, The Rocket. 
She also began her coaching career while an 
undergraduate, coaching the East Lawrence 
girls’ softball team to a league championship. 
She would later coach the Luzerne County 
Community College softball team. 
Following the end of her playing career, 
Kathy began officiating basketball at the high 
school and Division II and III collegiate levels. 
Over the next 40 years, she amassed an im-
pressive resume, officiating for regular season 
games in addition to league playoffs, district 
championships, the PIAA Girls State Cham-
pionships, and NCAA Division III playoff 
games. Kathy’s fair and competent officiating 
skills earned her the title of chapter interpreter, 
a position she held for nearly 30 years. She 
conducted rules meets, answered rules ques-
tions from coaches and fellow officials, and 
taught proper officiating techniques. Kathy has 
also been a long-time boys and girls volleyball 
official. 
In 1980, Kathy took up golf and found great 
success locally, regionally, and nationally. She 
founded the Shadowbrook Women’s Gold 
League and hosted the Shadowbrook Wom-
en’s Invitational. She is a longtime member of 
the United States Golf Association, and she is 
a longtime champion of girls’ and women’s 
golf. 
It is an honor to recognize Kathy on her in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May her story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

HON. JOHN JOYCE

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-

Leah won a silver medal in the girls 100- 
yard Backstroke with a time of 55.65 seconds.

events at the District 6 Championship. She is

Tigersharks Swim Team. In addition to these 
two state medals, she has won four medals in

INFANT FORMULA PROTECTION 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
announce the reintroduction of my Infant For-
mula Protection Act of 2021. The measure 
would prevent pharmacies, supermarkets, con-
venience stores, and other establishments 
from selling expired baby formula and would 
consider the sale of baby formula after the 
product’s ‘‘use by’’ date to be a prohibited act. 
A retailer that commits such an act can incur 
fines and penalties. 
The practice of selling expired baby formula 
is not only legal but widespread. As a mom, 
I know the fear and pressure that comes with 
caring for a newborn; all a new parent wants 
is to make sure their baby is healthy. Busy 
parents need to be able to rely on the safety 
of products, like formula, that they buy in gro-
cery stores in order to make sure that their 
newborns are well-fed and healthy. Retailers 
that stock expired formula—even by just a few 
days—pose real health risks to infants. 
Madam Speaker, we cannot take chances 
with what we feed our babies, and parents 
must be able to trust the safety of the prod-
ucts that they buy in their stores. I urge all of 
my colleagues to support the Infant Formula 
Protection Act.

HONORING GERALDINE O’MARA ON 
HER 95TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. JACKIE WALORSKI 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Geraldine O’Mara who will 
celebrate the milestone of her 95th birthday on 
April 4, 2021. 
A New Yorker through and through, Geral-
dine was born in Queens and grew up in Sag 
Harbor and Steward Manor. One of 12 broth-
ers and sisters, Geraldine has always held 
family as a guiding light and source of 
strength. Geraldine was married to the late 
Thomas J. O’Mara, a World War II veteran, 
and together they had three children, Sharon, 
James, and Michael. She has dedicated her 
life to being a role model for her children and 
giving them every opportunity to learn, grow, 
and find the path to success. 
Coming from a large family, one of 
Geraldine’s greatest blessings in life is spend-
ing time with her seven grandchildren and 
seven great-grandchildren. To this day, she 
enjoys reading scripture and tending to her 
garden, and is known for giving back to those 
in need and lifting others up with her strength. 
Madam Speaker, people like Geraldine 
make our country a better place, and I ask my 
colleagues to join me in wishing her good 
health and many more birthdays.

LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, current coach, 
and northeastern Pennsylvania native Kathy 
Healey. Kathy was inducted into the Luzerne 
County Sports Hall of Fame in 2020 for her 
distinct athletic achievements in the sports of 
basketball and softball. She and her fellow in-
ductees will be honored at a reception this 
spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the State of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
Kathy had a standout athletic career at 
Seton Catholic High School in Pittston, Penn-
sylvania, playing basketball and soccer. She 
helped lead her teams to three league titles, 
three district titles, and state playoff games. 
After graduating from Seton Catholic, Kathy 
earned her bachelor’s degree in health and 
physical education from Marywood University 
and her master’s degree in educational devel-
opment and strategies from Wilkes University. 
While an undergraduate at Marywood, she 
began coaching basketball at St. Mary’s 
School. Under her direction, the team won 
four league titles and played in four Diocesan 
Championships. 
In 1982, Kathy returned to her alma mater 
Seton Catholic as assistant basketball coach 
where she helped coach the team during sev-
eral undefeated seasons. After being named 
head coach in 1990, her team won two Wyo-
ming Valley League titles and two district titles 
and went on to the State playoffs eleven out 
of 12 years. During the 1996–1997 season 
and the 1997–1998 season, the varsity team 
was 50–5. She coached her team all the way 
to the eastern semifinal game only to lose in 
double overtime. She has coached numerous 
1000-point scorers, all-star team players, and 
one all-State player. Kathy also coached the 
softball team, turning a losing team into a 
league contender in 3 years. In their third 
year, the team finished the season with an 
11–4 record. In 1990, she was named Wyo-
ming Valley Softball Coach of the Year. 
Kathy moved on to coach at Wyoming Area 
High School where her teams competed year- 
round. In 2009, she started coaching at 
Pittston Area High School, turning the team 
into league contender and one of the top 
teams in Division I of the Wyoming Valley 
Conference (WVC). The team made school 
history in 2015 by winning the District 2 Class 
4A title. Her players included many 1000-point 
scorers, all-stars, and an all-State player. She 
also coached many of the WVC’s best players 
on Rock Solid, an Amateur Athletic Union 
(AAU) travel team which competed in the na-
tional championship. Kathy currently coaches 
the Hanover Area girls’ softball team where 
she also teaches health and physical edu-
cation. 
Kathy has been recognized for her contribu-
tions to the community and athletics. She was 
the recipient of the Thomas Brennan Award 
for her commitment to the Seton Catholic 
community, and she was voted Educator of 
the Year in 2018 by the Wyoming/Luzerne 
County System of Care and Best High School 
Athletic Coach by the Pittston Sunday Dis-
patch nine times. She most recently won the 
Attorney Joseph F. Saporito Lifetime of Serv-
ice Award. 
It is an honor to recognize Kathy on her in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May her story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

RECOGNIZING THE ETA NU CHAP-
TER OF ALPHA PHI ALPHA FRA-
TERNITY, 
INCORPORATED 
ON 
THEIR 50 YEAR ANNIVERSARY 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
the founding of the Eta Nu Chapter of Alpha 
Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated. The Eta Nu 
Chapter was chartered on April 3, 1971 on the 
campus of East Carolina University (ECU) lo-
cated in Greenville, North Carolina. 
Under the direction of eight men, A.A. Best, 
J.J. Wise, W.G. Keys, O.T. Faison, C.H.G. 
White, J.C. Bryant, J.P. Harrison, and A.D. 
Moseley, Eta Nu was established on the cam-
pus of ECU. 
At that moment, the Eta Nu Chapter be-
came ECU’s first Black fraternity and the first 
Black Greek-lettered organization (BGLO) to 
be chartered on the campus of a Predomi-
nantly White Institution (PWI) in the State of 
North Carolina. As a result, the Chapter be-
came a leader as one of the first Black frater-
nities established at a PWI in the South. The 
first initiates into the Eta Nu Chapter were 
known as the Undisputed Truth. Members of 
that first line are as follows: David Franklin, 
Gregory Clark, Jerry Congelton, John Clark, 
Tony Sedgewick, Jimmy Louis, Tommy Patter-
son, James Mitchell, Kenneth Hammond, 
James Johnson, and Kenneth Wright. These 
men promoted brotherhood, understanding, 
and a cohesive unity influencing future mem-
bers of the Chapter to help form the Black 
Student Union—an organization that brought 
Black students together across campus to 
bring unity and advocate for issues affecting 
them to campus faculty and administration. 
Throughout the years, the Eta Nu Chapter 
has excelled and raised the bar for others to 
follow, maintaining high standards of scho-
lastic achievement and service to the commu-
nity—most notably, hosting an annual scholar-
ship pageant whose winner eventually became 
Miss America 2019. The Chapter holds sev-
eral distinguished honors for their contributions 
to ECU and the community: The first Black 
Student Government President, the first Black 
Student Government Vice President, the first 
three Black Homecoming kings crowned in 
consecutive years followed by a fourth mem-
ber of the Chapter who won in 2014, and nine 
awardees of the ECU 40 Under 40 Leadership 
Award since the initial awards were presented 
in 2015. 
Members of the Eta Nu Chapter have 
worked diligently to increase the number of 
opportunities available to our youth; they have 
engaged in relentless efforts toward the im-
provement of the campus and the community. 
One such measure is a leadership academy 
partnering with the Zeta Eta Lambda graduate 
chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha’s Pharaohs Pro-
gram to help mentor young Black men. Addi-
tionally, countless fundraisers to raise scholar-
ship money for youth and young adults in the 
community have also been part of the Chap-
ter’s philanthropic initiatives. 
Madam Speaker, it is my understanding that 
the members of the Eta Nu Chapter at East 
Carolina University are committed to distin-
guishing themselves as the most exemplary

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
258TH 
ENGI-
NEER COMBAT BATTALION AND 
THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
RHINE RIVER ASSAULT 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I’m honored 
to congratulate the Army’s 258th Engineer 
Combat Battalion for their heroism and service 
to United States of America as we commemo-
rate the 75th anniversary of the Rhine River 
Assault Crossing. Initially to be celebrated this 
past year when the pandemic began, we must 
waste no more time in honoring these brave 
Warriors of ‘‘The Greatest Generation.’’ 
The 258th ECB was activated at Camp 
Shelby, Mississippi, on November 20, 1943; 
draftees from Pennsylvania reported to the 
New Cumberland Reception Center on Janu-
ary 25, 1944, where they built a kitchen for 
their train and loaded it with equipment, pre-
paring for the trip to a destination unknown. 
Upon arriving at Camp Shelby on February 5, 
and united with other draftees, the battalion of 
over 600 was formed; with PA residents com-
prising 20 percent of the battalion and 44 dif-
ferent states. Over 8 months at Camp Shelby, 
the battalion completed twelve (12) weeks of 
Infantry and Engineer Basic Training, and 
eight (8) weeks of Advanced Engineer Train-
ing—learning additional mine clearing tech-
niques and bridge construction. 
The battalion left for Camp Shanks, NY, in 
October before leaving the New York Harbor 
later that month. They would arrive in Swan-
sea, Wales, on November 4, and would spend 
time throughout the United Kingdom prior to 
their departure for Le Havre, France, near 
year’s end—from which the Battalion would be 
split up throughout France and the Nether-
lands, working on road maintenance before 
they’d reconvene in Stevensweert, Holland, to 
begin training for the Rhine River Assault 
Crossing. 
Beginning their training on March 7, 1945, 
the small country town of Stevensweert along 
the Maas River would serve as the launching 
point for the Rhine River Assault alongside the 
30th Infantry Division. In the days to come, the 
battalion spent time unloading equipment and 
getting the storm boats ready for river training. 
Soldiers trained with the infantry day and night 
to operate the 22 H.P. Storm Boat Motors in 
preparation for the assault, having to remain 
extremely quiet on their approach. They later 
arrived near Rheimsburg, Germany, on March 
20—4KM from the Rhine, camouflaging the 
boats with brush until they were fully prepared 
for the crossing. 
On March 24, they moved the final 200 
yards under cover of smoke pots to the bank 
of the Rhine River, launching the storm boats 
and waiting for H-Hour amidst what was the 
largest artillery barrage of the war to that 
point. 
The 
battalion’s 
assault 
began 
at 
0200hrs, as a heavy smoke screen laid over 
the river, forcing some boats to lose their di-
rection and forcing them back to the starting 
shore. S/Sgt. Ray Mosser’s boat of two engi-
neers and seven infantry was the first of three 
waves to cross the river, encountering light re-
sistance while others faced sniper and ma-
chine gun fire, as German resistance contin-
ued until daylight when the Germans sent up 
flares and artillery fire. Soon after their land-
ing, the infantry was able to advance through 
enemy lines, and it wasn’t long before they 
were bringing back prisoners. The battalion’s 
assault brought numerous casualties, including 
Squad Sergeant Paul Eberle, Pvt. Joseph 
Sasso, and Tech. Sergeant Robert Strayer. 
I am honored to commend the entire 258th 
Engineer Combat Battalion for their distin-
guished service to our great Nation. Their 
bravery and sacrifice was instrumental to 
crossing the Rhine River—the last natural ob-
stacle to overcome in the continued advance-
ment of Allied Forces. Their victory helped 
lead to the eventual German surrender on 
May 8, 1945—aka ‘‘V-E Day’’—all made pos-
sible by a battalion trained to build bridges. 
We shall long remember their heroism in pro-
tecting our country and the world from the 
evils of Nazism. May God bless them for their 
tireless service, their dedication to our Amer-
ican freedom, and their legacy of sacrifice.

HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Anderson 
Card for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Anderson Card is a student at Oberon Mid-
dle School and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Anderson 
Card is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to An-
derson Card for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future

HONORING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
MATZORKIS 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. DeSAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, along with Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE, to recognize the life of James ‘‘Jim’’ 
Matzorkis. 
Born in Chicago in 1952, Jim moved with 
his parents to California as a child. He later 
graduated from the University of Maryland with 
a bachelor of Arts in Business Administration. 
After gaining experience in both the private 
and public sectors, Jim began working for the 
Port of Richmond in 1998 as a Marketing 
Manager and became the Executive Director 
in 2001. One of Jim’s many accomplishments 
is completing the Honda Port of Entry, which 
brought significant profitability to the Port. As 
a testament to Jim’s leadership, out of the 149 
ports in the United States, the Port of Rich-
mond is currently ranked 27th in total trade. 
The Port has generated millions of dollars in 
revenue for the City of Richmond and brought 
local and international business to our commu-
nity. 
Jim’s professional knowledge and dedication 
led to him serving on the Bay Planning Coali-
tion Board of Directors and the California As-
sociation of Port Authorities Executive Advi-
sory Committee. He also participated in Rich-
mond’s sister cities program and helped facili-
tate a strong and lasting relationship with 
Zhoushan, China, one of Richmond’s three 
sister cities. 
In his personal life, Jim married his high 
school sweetheart, Beverly, and the couple 
had two daughters. He was known as the pa-
triarch of his family, organizing family reunions 
and ensuring everyone stayed connected. He 
loved to travel, especially to Greece where his 
family would all come together. Jim also en-
joyed regaling others with stories from his time 
working as a concert promoter and security in 
the rock and roll industry. 
Sadly, at just 68 years old, Jim passed 
away at his home in Oakland, California in De-
cember 2020. Jim is remembered by his 
friends and colleagues as kind and enthusi-
astic, and someone who made sure everyone 
around him was happy. Please join me and 
Congresswoman BARBARA
LEE
in honoring 
James Matzorkis for his many contributions to 
our community.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LATE 
WILLIAM O’BOYLE, SR., ON HIS 
INDUCTION INTO THE LUZERNE 
COUNTY SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Plymouth Little League found-
er, veteran, and northeastern Pennsylvania 
native William O’Boyle, Sr. William was in-
ducted into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame in 2020 for his community engagement 
and as a co-founder of the Plymouth Little 
League. He and his fellow inductees will be 
honored at a reception this spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the State of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
William was born in 1922 and grew up in 
Plymouth, Pennsylvania. In his youth, he en-
joyed all sports and was a particularly talented 
roller skater and ice skater. He graduated from 
Plymouth High School in 1941. 
William answered the call to serve his coun-
try and joined the United States Army to fight 
in World War II. He was part of the Normandy 
invasion when Allied troops stormed the 
beaches of Northern France. After exiting the 
landing craft, he valiantly progressed up the

hill toward the enemy, and in his charge to en-
gage in combat, he stepped on a land mine 
which resulted in the loss of his right leg. 
William was not deterred by his injury; he 
returned home and was fitted with a prosthetic 
leg. He married his wife, Elizabeth, and to-
gether they had one son, William, Jr. He 
worked at Leslie Fay as their traffic manager 
and became actively involved in his local com-
munity. In 1950, with his friend Joseph ‘‘Shep’’ 
Chepulis, he cofounded the Plymouth Little 
League. He served as league president every 
year except for the 4 years his son played in 
the league. Under his direction, Maureen 
Dillion was appointed the first female umpire 
in local Little League history, and she would 
eventually be named the league’s umpire-in- 
chief. 
Moved by his time in the Army and seeking 
to connect with those who shared similar ex-
periences, William became active in local vet-
erans’ organizations. He was a past com-
mander of the Plymouth American Legion and 
VFW and a member of the Disabled American 
Veterans and the Fraternal Order of Eagles. 
William passed away in 1995, but the Plym-
outh Little League and his legacy as a com-
munity role model and leader live on. 
It is an honor to recognize William on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and dedication to his 
community serve as an inspiration to the next 
generation of Pennsylvanians.

RECOGNIZING LEVI HAINES 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate Levi Haines of 
Biglerville High School for winning the PIAA 
Class 2A Wrestling Championship. 
As a standout wrestler, Haines earned a 
gold medal in the 145-pound championship 
match against rival Nathan Higley of Sullivan 
County. In the past two years, he captured 
back-to-back silver medals in the PIAA Cham-
pionship match. Haines finished this season 
undefeated winning thirty matches. As a jun-
ior, he has collected a career record of 100– 
5. He is coached by his father, Ken Haines, 
who also won a state championship in 1995 
for Gettysburg. He has become the fourth stu-
dent at Biglerville to earn this prestigious title. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsyl-
vania, I congratulate Levi Haines on a suc-
cessful season and wish him every continued 
success as he pursues his education and ath-
letic goals.

SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
LINCOLNVIEW HIGH SCHOOL FOR 
WINNING THE DIVISION V STATE 
CHEERLEADING CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
cheerleading squad in Ohio’s Fifth Congres-
sional District. The young athletes of the 
Lincolnview High School cheerleading squad 
have represented their school ably on their 
way to becoming the Division V, Building Cat-
egory, State Cheerleading champs. In their ef-
fort to surpass all other squads in the Division 
V State Cheerleading Championship, the 
Lincolnview 
cheerleaders 
employed 
out-
standing teamwork, overcoming the chal-
lenges posed by intense competition. 
Due 
to 
COVID–19 
restrictions, 
the 
Lincolnview cheerleaders had to radically ad-
just their practice routine to a virtual mode as 
they prepared for their normal season and 
STATE competition. The squad submitted a 
well-rehearsed competition video in February 
and after judging, STATE athletic officials de-
livered the championship trophy to the squad 
in March. The Lincolview cheerleading squad 
has won the championship 2 years in a row 
and three times in the last 4 years. The mem-
bers of this very special squad have carried 
on that tradition by showing both the individual 
efforts and teamwork that their sport requires 
to achieve championship performance. Their 
hard work and dedication which culminated in 
this accomplishment is truly outstanding. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to the Lincolnview 
High School cheerleaders. On behalf of the 
people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am proud 
to recognize this great achievement.

Ashlyne Gomez is a student at Arvada K– 
8 and received this award because her deter-
mination and hard work have allowed her to

ment that can be attained with hard work and

cation and develop a work ethic which will

have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

HONORING FRANK BRADY 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Frank Brady of Bluefield, Virginia, 
who has announced his retirement as General 
Manager of WVVA–TV. Frank is a 47–year 
veteran broadcaster who devotes his profes-
sional and personal time to improving the 
greater Bluefield region. 
WVVA broadcasts to residents of Virginia’s 
Ninth District as well as in West Virginia. Many 
Southwest Virginians tune into WVVA for their 
news. Frank arrived at WVVA in 2005 from 
KHQA–TV in Quincy, Illinois, bringing his ex-
tensive knowledge of the broadcasting indus-
try to the Bluefield market. Under his manage-
ment, WVVA added nine additional hours of 
news programming and four additional chan-
nels to its digital signal. His professional work 
has been honored by the Mel Burka Distin-
guished 
Broadcaster 
Award 
for 
lifetime 
achievement by the West Virginia Broad-
casters Association. 
Frank’s time in Bluefield has also been 
characterized by community service and advo-
cacy for the region. Under his management, 
WVVA regularly engages in charity work in its 
viewing area, including food and clothing 
drives. It partners each holiday season with 
the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve in the Toys for 
Tots campaign, providing toys for over 2,600 
children in the region. Frank has chaired the 
Bluefield Chamber of Commerce and serves 
on the boards of the Community Foundation of 
the Two Virginias and the Bluefield State Col-
lege Foundation. He promotes the region’s 
economic development and cultural events. 
As Congressman for Virginia’s Ninth District, 
I have been a regular visitor to WVVA and 
participant in the debates it sponsors. When I 
am in the Bluefield area, I appreciate the op-
portunity to come by the studio and commu-
nicate with constituents about my work in the 
House of Representatives, but I also appre-
ciate the chance to stop in and see Frank, and 
over the years we have developed a friend-
ship. I would like to congratulate Frank on 
concluding his impressive career in broad-
casting and wish him all the best upon his re-
tirement.

FARMWORKER PESTICIDE SAFETY 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the Farmworker Pesticide Safety Act 
in commemoration of Cesar Chavez Day. This 
legislation is endorsed by the Association of 
American Pesticide Control Officials (AAPCO). 
The Farmworker Pesticide Safety Act would 
support the correct application of pesticides in 
agriculture and provide farmworkers additional 
resources for the safe handling of pesticides 
and proper decontamination protocols fol-
lowing their workday. This new federal funding 
would come at no cost to taxpayers, comple-
menting the substantial investments Califor-
nia’s Department of Pesticide Regulation is al-
ready making to ensure that farmworkers and 
their young children are not exposed to dan-
gerous pesticide levels in my State. 
Specifically, my bill would effectively triple 
funding for the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency’s (USEPA) worker protection, public- 
private partnership, and pesticide safety edu-
cation grant programs. I am honored to rep-
resent the University of California, Davis Ex-
tension, which is the single largest recipient of 
this federal grant money in the entire country. 
According to the USEPA, the agency col-
lected between $2.3 million to $9.25 million

annually for pesticide regulatory violations 
over the past 5 years. Under current federal 
law, these fines and penalties collected from 
lawbreakers in the pesticide industry revert to 
the U.S. Treasury. 
My Farmworker Pesticide Safety Act would 
instead direct these fines toward the USEPA’s 
three major pesticide safety grant programs, at 
no additional cost to taxpayers, growers, or 
the pesticide industry. This means my bill 
would provide an average of $4.15 million per 
year in additional USEPA grant funding. 
In 2019, Congress passed the Pesticide 
Registration Improvement Extension Act of 
2018 (Public Law 116–8) reauthorizing the fee 
schedule for pesticide registrations with the 
USPEA through the end of fiscal year 2023. I 
look forward to working with Chairman SCOTT 
and all members of the Committee on Agri-
culture to include the Farmworker Pesticide 
Safety Act in the next PRIA reauthorization.

INTO 
THE 
LUZERNE 
COUNTY 
SPORTS HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete and northeastern 
Pennsylvania native Dr. Michael Portonova. 
Michael was inducted into the Luzerne County 
Sports Hall of Fame in 2020 for his distinct 
athletic achievements in the sport of tennis. 
He and his fellow inductees will be honored at 
a reception this spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the State of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
Michael 
is 
the 
son 
of 
Michael 
and 
Marydonna Portonova. He attended Bishop 
Haffey High School where he stood out as a 
star player on the tennis team. While at 
Bishop Haffey, he compiled a 56–0 regular 
season NEPTL record. He was a three-time 
Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Associa-
tion (PIAA) District 2AA Singles champion and 
a two-time bronze medalist at the PIAA State 
Singles Championship. Michael was ranked 
second in the United States Tennis Associa-
tion’s (USTA) Middle State Section in 2003– 
2004 and was ranked in the top 30 in the 
USTA National Boys’ 18 and under division in 
2003–2004. 
Michael began his collegiate career playing 
Division I tennis at St. Joseph’s University in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 2004, he won 
the Swarthmore Invitation at No. 2 Singles. He 
then transferred to King’s College in Wilkes- 
Barre, Pennsylvania, where he held a 71–2 
record and an undefeated record in Middle At-
lantic Conference (MAC) play during his 3- 
year career on the team. 
For his efforts on the court, Michael was 
named MAC Player of the Year 3 years in a 
row (2005–2007), and he was the MAC 
Champion five times, twice for doubles and 
three times for singles. He was named to the 
MAC Conference All-Century Team in 2014. 
After graduating from King’s College with a 
degree in pre-medical biology, he went on to 
study chiropractic at New York Chiropractic 
College in Seneca Falls, New York. He com-
pleted a clinical residency in Long Island, New 
York. He owns and operates his own practice, 
Portonova Chiropractic LLC, as a solo practi-
tioner in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. 
It is an honor to recognize Michael on his 
induction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame. May his story and athletic career 
serve as an inspiration to the next generation 
of Pennsylvania athletes striving for excel-
lence.

RECOGNIZING THE STUDENTS OF 
JOHNSTOWN CHRISTIAN SCHOOL 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize the students of Johns-
town Christian School in Hollsopple, Pennsyl-
vania, for their compassion, work ethic, and 
community service. 
During the school’s second annual ‘‘Feed 
the Need’’ packing party, students labeled, 
filled, and sealed more than 10,000 packages 
of nutritious meals to feed children both in 
Haiti and in the Greater Johnstown region. In 
total, 8,500 of the meals will reach children in 
Haiti who are struggling with food insecurity, 
and the remaining 1,500 will be sent to local 
organizations that provide services in the 
Johnstown community. Acts of service like this 
are invaluable to our Johnstown community 
both in teaching compassion to our students 
and in providing help to those in need. I am 
grateful for the Johnstown Christian School, 
and it is my hope they continue to be a model 
for success. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I thank the students of Johns-
town Christian School for their work to help 
those in need both in their community and in 
Haiti.

Over the past year they have faced chal-

have shown incredible resolve in the face of 
adversity. They have shown us all how to 
seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the Nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-
working individuals.

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF JEFF 
MEYER FOR WINNING THE DIVI-
SION 
III 
WRESTLING 
STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Jeff Meyer of Columbus Grove High School 
has represented his school ably on his way to 
achieving the Division III State wrestling title. 
Jeff overcame the challenges posed by in-
tense competition in his effort to win the Divi-
sion III State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State championship, Jeff 
Meyer defeated his opponent in the finals of 
the 285-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. He has achieved an impressive sea-
son record bringing pride to his school and 
community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Jeff Meyer of 
Columbus Grove High School. On behalf of 
the people of the Fifth District of Ohio, I am 
proud to recognize this great achievement. 
RECOGNIZING THE ELLINGTON 
WHIPPETS 
HON. JASON SMITH 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the Ellington High School 
Lady Whippets who made school history 
March 12, 2021 when they became the Mis-
souri Class 2 State Basketball Champions. 
It’s the school’s first ever state basketball 
championship and it came in the Whippets’ 
63–56 come-from-behind win over the Wel-
lington-Napoleon Tigers. 
From the very beginning of the season, 
Coach David Burrows told his team he be-
lieved they could have a great year. They 
ended their season with a 23–5 record. 
I offer my heartfelt congratulations to Coach 
Burrows, Assistant Coach Paula King and 
team members: Millie Barnett, Briley Bouma, 
Hiley 
Brewer, 
Holly 
Burrows, 
Megan 
Copeland, Laura Gore, Gretchen Hackworth, 
Abbi Harper, Kaylee King, Sadie Lloyd, 
Shemaine Lovell, Ellarae Morton, Lyndy Nash,

IN RECOGNITION OF PAUL RICH-
ARDS ON HIS INDUCTION INTO 
THE LUZERNE COUNTY SPORTS 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. MATT CARTWRIGHT 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former athlete, coach, and 
northeastern Pennsylvania native Paul Rich-
ards. Paul was inducted into the Luzerne 
County Sports Hall of Fame in 2020 for his 
distinct athletic achievements in the sport of 
swimming. He and his fellow inductees will be 
honored at a reception this spring. 
Each year, the Luzerne County Sports Hall 
of Fame honors those who have brought fame 
and recognition to the State of Pennsylvania 
through their outstanding achievements and 
contributions in athletic endeavors. 
Paul grew up in South Wilkes-Barre, Penn-
sylvania, in a family of avid swimmers. From 
1968 to 1971, he swam for E.L. Meyers High 
School where he helped lead the team to four 
consecutive District II championships. He 
earned three individual championships in the 
100 butterfly, 200 freestyle, and 400 freestyle. 
In 1968, he was named All-State in the 400 
freestyle. He held the school records in the 
50, 100, 200, and 400 freestyle; the 100 but-
terfly; and the 200 individual medley. 
Paul continued his academic and athletic 
careers at Bloomsburg State College in 
Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. He continued to 
excel in the pool, holding the school record in 
the 200 individual medley. He was a member 
of the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference 
(PSAC) championship winning and record 
breaking 400 freestyle team which earned a 
berth at the 1974 national championship. 
Paul’s love of the sport led him to a four- 
decade collegiate coaching career. He began 
coaching at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New 
York, before moving to Mary Washington Col-
lege in Fredericksburg, Virginia. He spent the 
last 26 years coaching the Dickinson College 
Red Devils in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. 
Paul found great success at Dickinson. He 
coached his teams to more than 500 career 
wins and nine conference championships. His 
swimmers have been named conference 
champions, national champions, and NCAA 
All-Americans. He has been recognized as 
Coach of the Year 10 times. 
Paul has recently retired from coaching and 
teaching at Dickinson, and he lives in Carlisle 
with his wife, Jeanette. 
It is an honor to recognize Paul on his in-
duction into the Luzerne County Sports Hall of 
Fame. May his story and athletic career serve 
as an inspiration to the next generation of 
Pennsylvania athletes striving for excellence.

Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I am hon-

woman Carrie P. Meek on the occasion of her

April 1, 2021 
Despite growing up experiencing discrimina-
tion in the segregated South, she graduated 
from Florida A&M University in 1946 and then 
journeyed North where she would graduate 
with a Master of Science from the University 
of Michigan in 1948. She moved back to Flor-
ida to work at Bethune-Cookman University 
and then her alma matter Florida A&M, 
whereafter she accepted a position with 
Miami-Dade Community College. 
After a distinguished career in education as 
a single mother to two children, Congress-
woman Meek was the second Black legislator 
to be elected to the Florida House in 1979. 
She served there until 1982, when she be-
came the first African American woman to be 
elected to the Florida State Senate. As a State 
Senator, she served on the Education Appro-
priations Subcommittee and advanced minority 
and literacy policies. 
In 1992, Congresswoman Meek was elected 
to the U.S. House of Representatives from 
Florida’s 17th Congressional District. Upon 
taking office, she was placed on the powerful 
House Appropriations Committee, where she 
led on district priorities, including the hard 
work of helping Florida rebuild after the devas-
tation wrought by Hurricane Andrew. During 
her tenure, she successfully addressed issues 
such as economic development, health care, 
education, and housing for marginalized and 
underserved communities. Her efforts deliv-
ered $100 million in federal assistance to re-
build Dade County. She also sponsored legis-
lation creating the Florida Commission on the 
Status of Women. These exemplary contribu-
tions have inspired countless young women 
and men to serve their communities. 
Congresswoman Meek is a strong advocate 
for gender and racial equality, senior citizens, 
the poor, and Haitian immigrants. She has re-
ceived dozens of honors and awards including 
Juris Doctorates from the University of Miami, 
Florida A&M University, Barry University, Flor-
ida Atlantic University, and Rollins University. 
Madam Speaker, I had the great privilege of 
serving alongside Congresswoman Meek for 
many years. She is a trailblazer and inspira-
tion to so many women. I wish her many more 
years of happiness as she celebrates her 95th 
birthday.

Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Blake Church 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Blake Church is a student at Arvada West

cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Blake Church for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-

RECOGNIZING 
OFFICER 
BRETT 
FISHEL 
AS 
THE 
SPRINGETTS-
BURY 
TOWNSHIP 
POLICE 
DE-
PARTMENT 2019 OFFICER OF THE 
YEAR 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker. I’m honored 
to recognize Officer Brett Fishel upon earning 
the Springettsbury Township Police Depart-
ment 2019 Officer of the Year award. I com-
mend Officer Fishel on his years of service to 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the 
United States of America. 
Officer Fishel came to Springettsbury Town-
ship Police Department in 2015, following two 
years with the Southern York Regional Police 
Department. In 2019, Officer Fishel continued 
to do what he had done since his arrival: dis-
play good judgement, make sound decisions, 
and perform tireless service—especially when 
he was thrust into a greater leadership role. 
Due to staffing shortages and shift structure, 
Officer Fishel frequently served as ‘‘Officer in 
Charge’’ (OIC) during many shifts. In 2019; he 
was assigned to the permanent night shift, 
and still maintained OIC duties—effectively 
managing two positions; quite unusual for an 
officer who had been with the department only 
for a little over 3 years. 
Officer Fishel remained a leader in most ac-
tivity areas for patrolmen, maintaining the 
dedicated 
personal 
work 
ethic 
displayed 
throughout his tenure—all while becoming a 
new father. Despite missing December to wel-
come the new addition to his family, he had 
445 traffic enforcement contacts and made 79 
criminal arrests. In 2018, he was named a DUI 
Top Gun Award winner, and in 2019 he con-
tinued to keep our roads safe through 25 DUI 
arrests. 
Throughout Officer Fishel’s service, what 
stands out most is the manner in which he 
interacts with people around him. His calm 
and professional demeanor consistently re-
ceived praise from the community, with many 
citizens writing to STPD officially to thank him 
for his assistance. He even received thank 
you cards from some of those traffic contacts 
because of the way he treated them when he 
pulled them over. 
Officer Fishel was recognized for three inter-
nal accomplishments in 2019 for extraordinary 
actions taken in the line of duty, ranging from 
a motor vehicle theft arrest to saving some-
one’s life in a house fire. In the house fire inci-
dent, Officer Fishel and another officer were 
dispatched just across the York Township line 
where a disabled female was reporting her 
house was filled with smoke and she was un-
able to get out of bed. The two officers re-
sponded to the location to find a smoke-filled 
house with the front door locked and alarms 
sounding. Upon forcing the front door open, 
they were met by clouds of thick, dark smoke, 
which prevented them from seeing and navi-
gating the residence. With the help of a third 
officer from YARPD, they were able to locate 
the individual and carry her to safety. 
Officer Brett Fishel’s consistent profes-
sionalism and dedication to duty has set the 
standard for all officers to follow. For his ex-
emplary performance, tireless service, and 
commitment to the mission and vision, I am 
proud to honor him as the Springettsbury 
Township Police Department 2019 Officer of 
the Year.

ZACHARY HAMILTON EARNS 
EAGLE SCOUT RANK 
HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
Zachary Hamilton for earning the rank of 
Eagle Scout in Troop 79 of Valrico, FL. Eagle 
Scout is the highest honor a Boy Scout can 
earn. Since its inception in 1911, only four 
percent of Scouts have earned this rank. This 
honor requires years of effort to develop the 
necessary leadership, service, and outdoor 
skills. To earn it, Zachary’s project consisted 
of raising funds, collecting clothes, and repair-
ing bikes for a local homeless project. Zachary 
and many of his fellow Scouts then handed 
out these items and provided food for the 
homeless. The leadership skills he has 
learned through the Boy Scouts already ben-
efit our community and will continue to help in 
countless ways. 
Zachary began his Scouting Career as a 
Tiger Cub in Second Grade. He has been ac-
tive in Scouting as well as National Honor So-
ciety and Junior ROTC organizations. On be-
half of the Fifteenth Congressional District of 
Florida, congratulations again to Zachary 
Hamilton for becoming an Eagle Scout. We 
are proud of his continued success and thank 
him for his dedication to making our commu-
nity a better place.

JOEY BLAZE FOR WINNING THE 
DIVISION I WRESTLING STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 1, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, it is with a 
great deal of pride that I rise to pay a very 
special tribute to an outstanding high school 
wrestler in Ohio’s Fifth Congressional District. 
Joey Blaze, a sophomore at Perrysburg High 
School, has represented his school ably on his 
way to achieving the Division I State wrestling 
title. Joey overcame the challenges posed by 
intense competition in his effort to win the Di-
vision I State Wrestling Championship. 
In pursuing the State championship, Joey 
Blaze defeated his opponent in the finals of 
the 138-pound classification. His hard work 
and dedication, both on and off the mat, in 
achieving this accomplishment is truly out-
standing. Joey led his team to rank sixth place 
overall in the championship. He has achieved 
an impressive season record bringing pride to 
his school and community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in paying special tribute to Joey Blaze of
