BUDGET RECONCILIATION TO 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
the Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
this weekend I had the honor to work 
on our budget reconciliation in the 
Budget Committee. The legislation 
contains economic development initia-
tives that I have long championed to 
create good-paying jobs while lowering 
costs and cutting taxes for American 
families. This is the kind of legislation 
that assures the rest of the American 
people that they have not been aban-
doned in their time of need. 
The Build Back Better Act is a true 
job creator, creating millions of jobs 
while tackling the climate crisis and 
ensuring that America will not only 
compete but lead the way to a more 
prosperous future. 
Historic investments in clean energy 
technology will create 2 million jobs 
each year over the next decade, while 
reducing carbon emissions by over 50 
percent by the year 2030. We also in-
clude investment in workforce training 
to connect workers to jobs, research 
and development to strengthen Amer-
ican manufacturing, and access to 
credit and investment for small busi-
nesses. 
The Build Back Better Act will also 
make significant investments in Amer-
ican agriculture. As a member of the 
Agriculture Committee, we were able 
to include critical investments in agri-
cultural research, rural development, 
and renewable energy: $7.75 billion in 
agriculture research and infrastruc-
ture; $18 billion in rural job-promoting 
investments to ensure those living in 
rural America, on Tribal lands, and our 
insular areas have access to clean 
water and reliable and efficient re-
newal energy; and $40 billion in invest-
ments in forestry programs. 
It should concern us, and it concerns 
me, that CEOs make more than 350 
times more than the average worker, 
that billionaires have seen their wealth 
increase up to $1.18 trillion during the 
pandemic, or that 55 of the largest cor-
porations have paid zero dollars in Fed-
eral income taxes on over $40 billion of 
profits. 
These are what my colleagues, the 
Republicans, are calling job creators. 
Recognize that phrase when you hear 
them say job creators. It means those 
CEOs and those businesses that have 
created wealth for themselves without 
jobs for the American people. 
It is incredulous to me that the top 1 
percent has evaded paying an esti-
mated $160 billion in taxes each year 
while the average American pays his or 
her taxes every year. Millionaires and 
billionaires are paying lower taxes 
than teachers, cops, and firefighters. 
But Democrats are bringing legisla-
tion that is going to keep America 
great, that is going to continue to 
make America the innovators. This is 
our moment to change the course of 
progress toward the everyday Amer-
ican. 
History will point to this week, this 
law, as the significant transformation 
in the lives of the American people and 
overall success of true American great-
ness. 
f 
STOP RECKLESS TAX-AND-SPEND 
SPREE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, this week, liberals will at-
tempt to ram through the most egre-
gious spending package since the New 
Deal. By adding $3.5 trillion in new 
spending, their plan would not lift fam-
ilies up; it would keep families down. 
By imposing liberals’ hidden tax by 
inflation, by pumping billions of dol-
lars into an economy that is already 
saturated from failed stimulus pack-
ages, my colleagues’ actions will di-
rectly harm working Americans. 
Raising taxes on middle-class fami-
lies and small businesses is not the an-
swer to ending the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Forcing businesses to conform to new 
regulations won’t get Americans back 
to work. 
Now is the time to support our fami-
lies. It is not the time to spend more 
money than it cost to win World War 
II. We need to put a stop to this reck-
less tax-and-spend spree, and we need

RECOGNIZING MAXIM SKRIPNIK 
AND GOSTOMEL ANIMAL SHELTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. FITZPATRICK) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, 
I come to the floor today to recognize 
Maxim Skripnik and the Gostomel Ani-
mal Shelter, an amazing individual and 
an amazing organization. 
The Gostomel Animal Shelter, lo-
cated just outside of Kiev, Ukraine, is 
serving homeless animals in Ukraine, 
both in Kiev and outside. 
As the co-chair of the Ukraine Cau-
cus here in Congress, Madam Speaker, 
I recently visited that country, and one 
of my many stops was at the Gostomel 
Shelter. This was originally estab-
lished by the Kyiv Society for the Pro-
tection of Animals. For the past 20 
years, the Gostomel Shelter has res-
cued abandoned animals off the streets 
of Ukraine, nursed them back to 
health, and gave them a second chance 
at life. 
The shelter is operated by Maxim, 
who graciously gave me a tour of the 
facility during my visit to Ukraine. 
Maxim has devoted his entire life to 
providing care for these vulnerable ani-
mals. 
Madam Speaker, there are an esti-
mated 50,000 stray animals on the 
streets of Ukraine. This poses a consid-
erable risk to the welfare of the ani-
mals and the overall public health of 
the community. The future for the ma-
jority of these vulnerable and aban-
doned and animals is bleak, but the 
Gostomel Shelter provides them with 
the opportunity to find a loving forever 
home. 
Since its inception, the Gostomel 
Shelter has advocated for their animals 
and promoted humane methods of con-
trolling the ever-growing population of 
stray animals. Each victory, no matter 
how small, creates an environment 
more accepting of these vulnerable ani-
mals and proves that they can be reha-
bilitated and adopted into loving fami-
lies. 
The shelter, which is housed in a 
former cowshed, provides safekeeping 
for up to 700 stray and abandoned dogs 
and cats. In 2006, the shelter estab-
lished a veterinary hospital and reha-
bilitation center, which is now one of 
the largest in all of Ukraine. Here, 
homeless animals are sterilized, after 
which they undergo compulsory reha-
bilitation in a hospital and return to 
the shelter where they await their for-
ever homes. 
Madam Speaker, the Gostomel Shel-
ter, Maxim, and KSPA do not have reli-
able sources of funding and permanent 
employees. They often rely on public 
donations and volunteers to provide 
food and medicine to the animals. 
During my visit, I witnessed first-
hand how Maxim and these volunteers 
work tirelessly, literally around the 
clock, to ensure these innocent ani-
mals have a second chance. 
Madam Speaker, I applaud the in-
credible work being done by Maxim and 
all the volunteers of the shelter. I paid 
a visit to the mayor of Kiev to relay all 
of my experiences and the positive im-
pact that Maxim and those volunteers 
are making, and I wanted to formally 
recognize them here in this Chamber. 
f 
CLIMATE IS MORE LIVABLE THAN 
EVER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while 
climate 
catastrophists 
claim 
that our climate is less livable than 
ever because of fossil fuels, it is actu-
ally more livable than ever, thanks to 
our fossil fuel powered climate protec-
tion systems. 
When you hear the scary claims 
about a climate crisis, keep in mind 
that climate catastrophists, or alarm-
ists as they are now known, have been 
claiming climate crisis for about 40 
years. 
If America tries to rapidly eliminate 
fossil fuel use through a Green New 
Deal or Biden climate plan, we will not 
prevent a crisis. We will cause a crisis 
by making energy completely unreli-
able and unaffordable for American in-
dustry and American consumers, espe-
cially the middle-income and lower in-
come folks. 
Now, what isn’t pointed out very 
often in all this talk about carbon di-
oxide being a pollutant is that carbon 
dioxide is 0.04 percent of our atmos-
phere. Most people think it is some big 
number like 20, 30, 40, 50 percent of our 
atmosphere. Nitrogen, number one, is 
78 percent; oxygen, number two, 21 per-
cent. CO2 is not even in third place. 
Argon is, 0.93 of 1 percent. 
Some of these pie charts you would 
look at on the internet would have car-
bon dioxide mixed in with other trace 
gases—other, okay? 
So, we are at 0.04 percent. It is an ex-
tremely small amount of our atmos-
phere. Now, you would think, again, 
with the alarmism going on, that it is 
a high percentage that is poisoning all 
of us. Carbon is a building block of 
most of what we have on this planet, 
carbon life forms, right? 
We are chasing down this path, I 
think, because of an agenda that is a 
lot different than the climate itself, es-
pecially when you see the folks that 
are pushing it the hardest still flying 
to all their Paris rallies and this and 
that in private jets, not living their 
lives any different, other than what 
normal people do. 
Coming back to the fossil fuel por-
tion of it, it would be worth it, so the 
alarmists say, to lower CO2 levels and 
avoid a crisis. But the U.S. causes less 
than one-sixth of all global emissions, 
and that number is even going lower. 
President Trump pulled us out of the 
Paris accord, yet the United States is 
still leading the way on lowering its 
CO2 production anyway. It has a lower 
net number than before, without an ac-
cord. The other countries in the devel-
oping world, in the Third World, in the 
Eastern Bloc, whatever, are still in-
creasing their numbers, building new 
coal-powered plants in China—one a 
week, some crazy number like that. 
We are supposed to adhere to that in 
this country and curb our production 
and curb our economy, even though we 
are leading the way in cleaner tech-
nology, cleaner-burning automobiles 
and 
trucks, 
cleaner-burning 
power 
plants. 
It is so crazy that in my home State 
of California, for example, when we 
look at the type of electricity produc-
tion that comes from green power 
sources, the environmentalists are try-
ing to get rid of them. We had two nu-
clear-powered 
plants 
in 
California. 
They already closed one, San Onofre, 
down by San Diego, and then one in 
San Luis Obispo. Those two themselves 
are responsible, at their peak produc-
tion, for somewhere around 16, 18, even 
20 percent of the whole grid of Cali-
fornia. Imagine knocking out 20 per-
cent of the grid in that short amount 
of time and trying to replace it with 
more politically correct green power. 
It is hard to get the permits to do the 
politically correct green power, such as 
making tens of thousands of acres cov-
ered with solar cells or windmills, but 
nonetheless, we are hellbent on that di-
rection. 
At the same time, they want to get 
rid of the use of natural gas and pro-
pane to power people’s stoves, power 
people’s water heaters, things like 
that, and have them go electric. They 
are hellbent on changing cars into 
being electric powered by 2035, no more 
combustion engine cars, all because of 
this 0.04 percent. 
What are we doing here? It is a polit-
ical agenda. 
Indeed, every committee in this new 
Congress has to spend a good portion of 
their time not talking about whether it 
is childcare, agriculture, or finance. 
They have to run it all through a cli-
mate change filter before we can move 
on to the work that needs to be done. 
Coming back to California, we some-
times have public safety power shut-
offs, they call it, because we have an 
issue of trees that might fall onto 
power lines or branches that the wind 
might catch and blow into power lines. 
Right here is an example of three fires 
that have happened in northern Cali-
fornia in the last couple of years. 
b 1215 
This one here is the current Dixie 
fire. I am using an older poster, be-
cause I am cheap, but this is now, in-
stead of 100,000 acres, a million acres. 
It would come all the way up here past 
Mount Lassen. 
What is the CO2 equation here of 
unmanaged forests? We need to manage

and have all the fire and soot and ash 
that blows all the way back to the East 
Coast. This CO2 this is deceptive, and 
we need to think differently. 
f 
THE NATIONAL DEBT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Georgia (Mrs. GREENE of Georgia) for 5 
minutes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to address the 
117th Congress and talk about our na-
tional debt. 
Currently, 
we 
are 
at 
$28,809,752,000,000. The numbers are ris-
ing so fast, I couldn’t name them all. It 
is continuing to rise, yet we are consid-
ering a budget this week at $4.3 tril-
lion, which would be the most expen-
sive piece of legislation in United 
States history, which is mind-boggling, 
especially considering the fact that we 
also are looking at voting on a $1.2 tril-
lion infrastructure bill that is mostly 
socialism, giving things away for free 
and wasting the taxpayers’ dollars. 
Considering the fact that we just 
abandoned Americans in Afghanistan, 
armed the Taliban, and 13 of our own 
military were killed in the process, we 
also just let in tens of thousands of 
Haitians into our country through our 
southern border, which is wide open 
and out of control. Also on Friday, the 
Democrats, all except one, voted for 
full-term abortion and called it wom-
en’s healthcare, then celebrated on the 
Capitol steps, which most people in 
this country find appalling. 
You see, abortion up until full term 
for a baby, at 9 months pregnancy, is 
evil and something that this Congress 
should have never considered. Yet, un-
fortunately, that is the bill that passed 
the House on Friday. 
So now we are looking at $4.3 trillion 
in new spending; $2.1 trillion in higher 
taxes; $2.4 trillion in new debt, with 
more interest; and $7.5 billion for a Ci-
vilian Climate Corps, which is part of 
the 
Green 
New 
Deal. 
Government 
doesn’t need to be creating a climate 
police force; government needs to be 
getting out of the way of the American 
people and their businesses so that 
they don’t have to compete with the 
Federal Government to hire people to 
get back to work. 
Businesses all over the country are 
struggling to find people to work in 
their companies. We need truck driv-
ers. We need nurses. 
We need to stop vaccine mandates 
and silly rules requiring people to wear 
masks everywhere they go and children 
to wear masks. If vaccines work, then 
people who get them should trust 
them. And if people are still afraid, 
then they can wear a mask. And if they 
are still afraid, then they can shelter 
in place. But the rest of the healthy 
population in the United States should 
not be limited and held back. We 
should be able to go to work, go to 
school, go into restaurants and stores, 
without being shamed and divided 
among the American people. 
COVID–19 has been a terrible thing 
sent to us through China and actually 
funded, sadly, through the gain-of- 
function research through our own 
Federal Government at the will of Dr. 
Fauci. Yet, he still has his job, while 
hundreds of thousands of small busi-
nesses have failed, and they don’t have 
their jobs. 
This government is failing the Amer-
ican people, and the more votes we 
take this week we are going to con-
tinue to fail the American people. 
This is why I walked in here this 
morning to make a motion to adjourn. 
But then I was told I couldn’t make a 
motion to adjourn because we hadn’t 
said the prayer or the pledge. It is very 
unfortunate. We should make a motion 
to adjourn because Congress should 
stop. Congress is the one ruining the 
lives of the American people, not help-
ing them, like they claim to do. 
It is our Federal Government’s role 
to keep our border strong, safe, and se-
cure. 
It is our government’s role to never 
abandon Americans in a foreign coun-
try ruled by radical Islamic terrorists 
that would like to kill them just be-
cause they are Americans. 
It is not our Federal Government’s 
job to pass a bill or consider even mak-
ing a law, abortion up until full term, 
and then call it women’s healthcare. 
This is too much. It is out of control. 
So, simply, I would like to make a 
motion to adjourn. I think it is silly 
that I can’t do so as an elected member 
of Congress representing the 14th Dis-
trict of Georgia simply because we 
haven’t said the pledge or the prayer. 
As you can see, rules in Congress just 
don’t work because the rules here in 
Congress are allowing everything to 
continue to go downhill and hurt the 
people that pay the taxes and pay for 
all of this up here anyway.

The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
Eternal God, we pray for Your sha-

Nation, our communities, and our fam-
ilies. 
In You, we find all that we need to be 
whole and well. In You, we are ground-
ed in truth, that we would show integ-
rity and honesty. In You, we are given 
purpose, a vision of what it means to 
dwell in harmony. 
In Your peace, we have all that we 
need to live and thrive. 
So if we align ourselves to Your para-
digm of peace, grant us then Your 
favor. If we humble ourselves, grant us 
success in our endeavors to do Your 
will. If we trust in You, give us a 
wealth of confidence in our abilities to 
carry out Your intent. If we follow 
Your guidance, prosper us with Your 
bounteous grace that we would experi-
ence the certainty of Your blessing. 
Then may our world, our Nation, our 
communities, and our families receive 
that blessing this day. 
In the peace of Your name we pray. 
Amen.

September 27, 2021

ital construction grants under the reconnecting 
communities 
pilot 
program 
under 
section 
11509(d)— 
(i) $65,000,000 for fiscal year 2022; 
(ii) $68,000,000 for fiscal year 2023; 
(iii) $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2024; 
(iv) $72,000,000 for fiscal year 2025; and 
(v) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2026. 
(C) TREATMENT.—Amounts made available 
under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be avail-
able for obligation in the same manner as if 
those amounts were apportioned under chapter 
1 of title 23, United States Code, except that 
those amounts shall remain available until ex-
pended. 
(e) DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.— 
(1) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(A) while significant progress has occurred 
due to the establishment of the disadvantaged 
business enterprise program, discrimination and 
related barriers continue to pose significant ob-
stacles for minority- and women-owned busi-
nesses seeking to do business in Federally as-
sisted surface transportation markets across the 
United States; 
(B) the continuing barriers described in sub-
paragraph (A) merit the continuation of the dis-
advantaged business enterprise program; 
(C) Congress has received and reviewed testi-
mony and documentation of race and gender 
discrimination from numerous sources, includ-
ing congressional hearings and roundtables, sci-
entific reports, reports issued by public and pri-
vate agencies, news stories, reports of discrimi-
nation by organizations and individuals, and 
discrimination lawsuits, which show that race- 
and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient 
to address the problem; 
(D) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in subparagraph (C) demonstrate that 
discrimination across the United States poses a 
barrier to full and fair participation in surface 
transportation-related 
businesses 
of 
women 
business owners and minority business owners 
and has impacted firm development and many 
aspects of surface transportation-related busi-
ness in the public and private markets; and 
(E) the testimony and documentation de-
scribed in subparagraph (C) provide a strong 
basis that there is a compelling need for the con-
tinuation of the disadvantaged business enter-
prise program to address race and gender dis-
crimination in surface transportation-related 
business. 
(2) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection: 
(A) SMALL BUSINESS CONCERN.— 
(i) IN
GENERAL.—The term ‘‘small business 
concern’’ means a small business concern (as the 
term is used in section 3 of the Small Business 
Act (15 U.S.C. 632)). 
(ii) EXCLUSIONS.—The term ‘‘small business 
concern’’ does not include any concern or group 
of concerns controlled by the same socially and 
economically disadvantaged individual or indi-
viduals that have average annual gross receipts 
during the preceding 3 fiscal years in excess of 
$26,290,000, as adjusted annually by the Sec-
retary for inflation. 
(B) SOCIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVAN-
TAGED
INDIVIDUALS.—The term ‘‘socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals’’ has 
the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of the 
Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and rel-
evant subcontracting regulations issued pursu-
ant to that Act, except that women shall be pre-
sumed to be socially and economically disadvan-
taged individuals for purposes of this sub-
section. 
(3) AMOUNTS FOR SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.— 
Except to the extent that the Secretary deter-
mines otherwise, not less than 10 percent of the 
amounts made available for any program under 
this division (other than section 14004), division 
C, and section 403 of title 23, United States 
Code, shall be expended through small business 
concerns owned and controlled by socially and 
economically disadvantaged individuals. 
(4) ANNUAL LISTING OF DISADVANTAGED BUSI-
NESS ENTERPRISES.—Each State shall annually— 
(A) survey and compile a list of the small busi-
ness concerns referred to in paragraph (3) in the 
State, including the location of the small busi-
ness concerns in the State; and 
(B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the 
percentage of the small business concerns that 
are controlled by— 
(i) women; 
(ii) socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals (other than women); and 
(iii) individuals who are women and are oth-
erwise socially and economically disadvantaged 
individuals. 
(5) UNIFORM CERTIFICATION.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall estab-
lish minimum uniform criteria for use by State 
governments in certifying whether a concern 
qualifies as a small business concern for the 
purpose of this subsection. 
(B) INCLUSIONS.—The minimum uniform cri-
teria established under subparagraph (A) shall 
include, with respect to a potential small busi-
ness concern— 
(i) on-site visits; 
(ii) personal interviews with personnel; 
(iii) issuance or inspection of licenses; 
(iv) analyses of stock ownership; 
(v) listings of equipment; 
(vi) analyses of bonding capacity;

(ix) analyses of financial capacity; and 
(x) analyses of the type of work preferred. 
(6) REPORTING.—The Secretary shall establish 
minimum requirements for use by State govern-
ments in reporting to the Secretary— 
(A) information concerning disadvantaged 
business enterprise awards, commitments, and 
achievements; and 
(B) such other information as the Secretary 
determines to be appropriate for the proper mon-
itoring of the disadvantaged business enterprise 
program. 
(7) COMPLIANCE WITH COURT ORDERS.—Noth-
ing in this subsection limits the eligibility of an 
individual or entity to receive funds made avail-
able under this division, division C, and section 
403 of title 23, United States Code, if the entity 
or person is prevented, in whole or in part, from 
complying with paragraph (3) because a Federal 
court issues a final order in which the court 
finds that a requirement or the implementation 
of paragraph (3) is unconstitutional. 
(8) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON PROMPT PAYMENT 
OF
DBE
SUBCONTRACTORS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(A) the Secretary should take additional steps 
to ensure that recipients comply with section 
26.29 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations 
(the disadvantaged business enterprises prompt 
payment rule), or any corresponding regulation, 
in awarding Federally funded transportation 
contracts under laws and regulations adminis-
tered by the Secretary; and 
(B) such additional steps should include in-
creasing the ability of the Department to track 
and keep records of complaints and to make 
that information publicly available.

TITLE III—FUELS AND TECHNOLOGY 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS 
Subtitle A—Carbon Capture, Utilization, 
Storage, and Transportation Infrastructure 
SEC. 40301. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the industrial sector is integral to the econ-
omy of the United States— 
(A) providing millions of jobs and essential 
products; and 
(B) demonstrating global leadership in manu-
facturing and innovation; 
(2) carbon capture and storage technologies 
are necessary for reducing hard-to-abate emis-
sions from the industrial sector, which emits 
nearly 25 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in 
the United States; 
(3) carbon removal and storage technologies, 
including direct air capture, must be deployed 
at large-scale in the coming decades to remove 
carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere; 
(4) large-scale deployment of carbon capture, 
removal, utilization, transport, and storage— 
(A) is critical for achieving mid-century cli-
mate goals; and 
(B) will drive regional economic development, 
technological innovation, and high-wage em-
ployment; 
(5) carbon capture, removal, and utilization 
technologies require a backbone system of 
shared carbon dioxide transport and storage in-
frastructure to enable large-scale deployment, 
realize economies of scale, and create an inter-
connected carbon management market; 
(6) carbon dioxide transport infrastructure 
and permanent geological storage are proven 
and safe technologies with existing Federal and 
State regulatory frameworks; 
(7) carbon dioxide transport and storage in-
frastructure share similar barriers to deployment 
previously faced by other types of critical na-
tional infrastructure, such as high capital costs 
and chicken-and-egg challenges, that require 
Federal and State support, in combination with 
private investment, to be overcome; and 
(8) each State should take into consideration, 
with respect to new carbon dioxide transpor-
tation infrastructure— 
(A) qualifying the infrastructure as pollution 
control devices under applicable laws (including 
regulations) of the State; and 
(B) establishing a waiver of ad valorem and 
property taxes for the infrastructure for a pe-
riod of not less than 10 years.

DIVISION F—BROADBAND 
TITLE 
I—BROADBAND 
GRANTS 
FOR 
STATES, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, PUER-
TO RICO, AND TERRITORIES 
SEC. 60101. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) Access to affordable, reliable, high-speed 
broadband is essential to full participation in 
modern life in the United States. 
(2) The persistent ‘‘digital divide’’ in the 
United States is a barrier to the economic com-
petitiveness of the United States and equitable 
distribution of essential public services, includ-
ing health care and education. 
(3) The digital divide disproportionately af-
fects communities of color, lower-income areas, 
and rural areas, and the benefits of broadband 
should be broadly enjoyed by all. 
(4) In many communities across the country, 
increased competition among broadband pro-
viders has the potential to offer consumers more 
affordable, high-quality options for broadband 
service. 
(5) The 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic has 
underscored the critical importance of afford-
able, high-speed broadband for individuals, 
families, and communities to be able to work, 
learn, and connect remotely while supporting 
social distancing.

REQUIREMENTS 
SEC. 70911. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that— 
(1) the United States must make significant 
investments to install, upgrade, or replace the 
public works infrastructure of the United States; 
(2) with respect to investments in the infra-
structure of the United States, taxpayers expect 
that their public works infrastructure will be 
produced in the United States by American 
workers; 
(3) United States taxpayer dollars invested in 
public infrastructure should not be used to re-
ward companies that have moved their oper-
ations, investment dollars, and jobs to foreign 
countries or foreign factories, particularly those 
that do not share or openly flout the commit-
ments of the United States to environmental, 
worker, and workplace safety protections; 
(4) in procuring materials for public works 
projects, entities using taxpayer-financed Fed-
eral assistance should give a commonsense pro-
curement preference for the materials and prod-
ucts produced by companies and workers in the 
United States in accordance with the high ideals 
embodied in the environmental, worker, work-
place safety, and other regulatory requirements 
of the United States;

tic content procurement preference, thus lim-
iting the impact of taxpayer purchases to en-

vest tax dollars in companies and processes

have been part of the United States procurement 
policy, ensuring that the United States can 
build and rebuild the infrastructure of the 
United States with high-quality American-made 
materials; 
(10) before the date of enactment of this Act, 
a domestic content procurement preference re-
quirement may not apply, may apply only to a 
narrow scope of products and materials, or may 
be limited by waiver with respect to many infra-
structure programs, which necessitates a review 
of such programs, including programs for roads, 
highways, and bridges, public transportation, 
dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime facili-
ties, intercity passenger and freight railroads, 
freight and intermodal facilities, airports, water 
systems, including drinking water and waste-
water systems, electrical transmission facilities 
and systems, utilities, broadband infrastructure, 
and buildings and real property; 
(11) Buy America laws create demand for do-
mestically produced goods, helping to sustain 
and grow domestic manufacturing and the mil-
lions of jobs domestic manufacturing supports 
throughout product supply chains; 
(12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, 
domestic content procurement preference poli-
cies apply to all Federal Government procure-
ment and to various Federal-aid infrastructure 
programs; 
(13) a robust domestic manufacturing sector is 
a vital component of the national security of the 
United States; 
(14) as more manufacturing operations of the 
United States have moved offshore, the strength 
and readiness of the defense industrial base of 
the United States has been diminished; and 
(15) domestic content procurement preference 
laws— 
(A) are fully consistent with the international 
obligations of the United States; and 
(B) together with the government procure-
ments to which the laws apply, are important 
levers for ensuring that United States manufac-
turers can access the government procurement 
markets of the trading partners of the United 
States.

SEC. 70951. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Make PPE 
in America Act’’. 
SEC. 70952. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The COVID–19 pandemic has exposed the 
vulnerability of the United States supply chains 
for, and lack of domestic production of, personal 
protective equipment (PPE). 
(2) The United States requires a robust, se-
cure, and wholly domestic PPE supply chain to 
safeguard public health and national security. 
(3) Issuing a strategy that provides the gov-
ernment’s anticipated needs over the next three 
years will enable suppliers to assess what 
changes, if any, are needed in their manufac-
turing capacity to meet expected demands. 
(4) In order to foster a domestic PPE supply 
chain, United States industry needs a strong 
and consistent demand signal from the Federal 
Government providing the necessary certainty to 
expand production capacity investment in the 
United States. 
(5) In order to effectively incentivize invest-
ment in the United States and the re-shoring of 
manufacturing, long-term contracts must be no 
shorter than three years in duration. 
(6) To accomplish this aim, the United States 
should seek to ensure compliance with its inter-
national obligations, such as its commitments 
under the World Trade Organization’s Agree-
ment on Government Procurement and its free 
trade agreements, including by invoking any 
relevant exceptions to those agreements, espe-
cially those related to national security and 
public health. 
(7) The United States needs a long-term in-
vestment strategy for the domestic production of 
PPE items critical to the United States national 
response to a public health crisis, including the 
COVID–19 pandemic.

SEC. 90003. FINDINGS REGARDING UNUSED UN-
EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUNDS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On July 16, 2021, the Congressional Budget 
Office (in this section referred to as ‘‘CBO’’) re-
duced its projected cost of the extension of ex-
panded unemployment compensation as enacted 
in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (P.L. 
117–2). 
(2) CBO budget projections included manda-
tory 
outlays 
for 
the 
expansion 
totaling 
$144,000,000,000 in 2021 and $8,000,000,000 in 
2022. That estimated cost is $50,000,000,000 less 
in 2021, and $3,000,000,000 less in 2022, than an-
ticipated in CBO’s March 2021 cost estimate. 
(3) CBO reduced its projections of those costs 
for two major reasons. First, several States have 
announced that they are discontinuing one or 
more of the components of expanded unemploy-
ment compensation before the expansion’s au-
thorization ends in September 2021. In its origi-
nal estimate, CBO projected that all States 
would participate in the programs until Sep-
tember. Second, because of the improving econ-
omy, the agency has lowered its forecast of the 
unemployment rate, resulting in fewer projected 
beneficiaries for the programs, which also re-
duced projected costs. 
(4) It is estimated that there are approxi-
mately $53,000,000,000 in savings from the 
amounts in the Treasury originally estimated to 
be spent on unemployment insurance funds 
(under the provisions of subtitle A of title II of 
division A of the CARES Act) not used by the 
States.

MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. DeFazio moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 3684. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 601, the mo-
tion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure or their respective des-
ignees. 
The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. 
DEFAZIO) and the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. GRAVES) each will control 30 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Oregon. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on the 
measure under consideration, H.R. 3684. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Oregon? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 5 minutes. 
Americans are tired of potholes dam-
aging their cars, failing bridges, de-
crepit transit, trains that derail, water 
mains that explode, sewer systems that 
back up into their basements and pol-
lute our rivers. 
More than 70 percent of Americans 
strongly support a major Federal in-
vestment in rebuilding our crumbling 
infrastructure. The last major increase 
in Federal support for infrastructure 
was during the Clinton administra-
tion’s first term—the first term of the 
Clinton administration. 
Then, President Bush did nothing on 
the issue. 
President Obama came in talking 
about infrastructure investment. He 
passed the American Recovery Act 
that invested 4 percent of all that 
money in infrastructure. I worked with 
Chairman Jim Oberstar; I chaired the 
subcommittee. We wrote a very ambi-
tious surface transportation reauthor-
ization, which he had been promised by 
the Obama administration would be 
next. But it wasn’t. They pulled the 
plug. 
Then came President Trump, the 
builder. He invited a large group of us 
down to the White House. We had a 
long discussion, and we agreed, and fi-
nally, at the end, he turned to the 
Speaker and says: NANCY, NANCY, how 
much do you need? 
And she says: $1.5 trillion, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
He says: No, no, no, no; $1.8 trillion. 
No, no, no; two sounds better, $2 tril-
lion. 
Okay. We agreed to come back in 3 
weeks and hammer out the details. 
We came back in 3 weeks. He walked 
into the room, and he had a hissy fit, 
slammed the door, walked out, and 
that was the end of it, except for the 
seven fake infrastructure weeks during 
the Trump administration. 
Now, the House, on the 1st of July, 
passed the INVEST Act, a bill that 
went through a real legislative process, 
hours 
in 
committee, 
amendments, 
hours on the floor, amendments. That 
was the bill the country most needed 
for the 21st century infrastructure. I 
had hoped to go to conference with the 
Senate, actually go through the legis-
lative process—pretty darn rare around 
here these days, the way things should 
work, the way they are supposed to 
work under the Constitution. Unfortu-
nately, because of the Senate fili-
buster, that wasn’t to happen. 
So, this President rolled up his 
sleeves and waded in because he prom-
ised to get infrastructure done. He ne-
gotiated first with one group of Repub-
licans. That didn’t work. He then found 
another group, mostly Republicans, 
two Democrats, and spent endless 
hours between the White House and 
that group, negotiating a bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
In the end, when this bill came to the 
floor of the Senate, 19 Republican Sen-
ators voted for it—19 Republican Sen-
ators voted for it. 
Here are a few things from the White 
House fact sheet on that bill. It makes 
the largest Federal investment in pub-
lic transit ever; makes the largest Fed-
eral investment in passenger rail since 
the creation of Amtrak; makes the sin-
gle largest dedicated bridge investment 
since the construction of the Interstate 
Highway System; makes the largest in-
vestment in clean drinking water and 
wastewater infrastructure in American 
history, delivering clean water to mil-
lions 
of 
Americans; 
ensures 
every 
American has access to reliable high- 
speed internet; tackles climate change 
with the largest investment in clean 
energy and EV infrastructure, electri-
fying thousands of school and transit 
buses; reconnecting communities; safe 
streets; $17 billion for ports; $25 billion 
for airports. 
This is what the President managed 
to negotiate with the recalcitrant Sen-
ate and get around the filibuster and 
get 19 Republican votes. 
b 1915 
This bill is not perfect. It is not the 
bill that I would have written. I oppose 
their decision not to correct the dec-
ade-long cuts to the bus program; the 
provision creating a dedicated set-aside 
for polluting buses within the Low or 
No Emission Vehicle Program. That is 
kind of laughable. I oppose the failure 
to tighten the Buy American Act re-
quirements for transit rolling stock or 
to further crack down on predatory 
Chinese state-owned enterprises, which 
was in our bill, as well as the omission 
of the investments in fix it first and 
mandatory greenhouse gas reductions. 
I will continue to work on addressing 
these issues. But the reality today be-
fore us is that this is the only option 
with an evenly divided Senate and the 
stupid rules of the Senate, including

the filibuster. So it is this or nothing 
on the long overdue investment in 
America’s infrastructure. 
I hope the Republicans on the other 
side will support it. If they don’t, I 
would like them to tell us exactly what 
they would do. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today’s bill is nothing 
more than a Trojan horse. It is a facade 
to lure everyone into opening a door 
for Speaker PELOSI’s real priority, a 
$3.5 trillion or more tax-and-spend 
plan. 
This is unfortunate, because like in-
frastructure bills of the past, a bipar-
tisan process was very possible. 
The Senate’s infrastructure bill in-
cludes some good provisions for im-
proving our infrastructure, but the 
process leading up to today and the 
lack of input from the House should 
have everyone concerned. 
We are establishing a terrible prece-
dent when we take away the ability of 
chairs and ranking members to write 
or influence a bill of this magnitude. 
Today’s debate structure tells the 
real story. In what world is 1 hour of 
debate on a $1.2 trillion package suffi-
cient? 
Not a single member in this Cham-
ber, on either side of the aisle, has had 
any input whatsoever in this bill as it 
was being negotiated in the Senate be-
cause Speaker PELOSI’s partisan path 
boxed the House out of the entire proc-
ess. 
House Republicans were eager to 
work on infrastructure, especially on a 
bipartisan, long-term highway bill for 
programs that expire just a few days 
from now. 
In fact, my Republican colleagues 
and I introduced the STARTER Act 
and made and outlined priorities we 
had hoped to address through a bipar-
tisan process. 
The STARTER Act proposed record 
levels of investment in our roads and 
bridges and, more importantly, made 
commonsense changes to improve the 
project delivery process, including re-
forming the outdated NEPA process. 
However, we were very clear that any 
package that got too large, too expen-
sive, or too costly would get no Repub-
lican support. 
But instead of working across the 
aisle to develop a bipartisan House bill 
that could be conferenced with the 
Senate, the Speaker hijacked the proc-
ess to hold infrastructure hostage for 
the $3.5 trillion or more socialist 
spending spree the progressives want to 
ram through using budget reconcili-
ation. 
Under their plan, the American peo-
ple will bear the brunt of this unfet-
tered spending. 
Inflation has gone up in every single 
month of this administration, and it is 
having the biggest impact on low-in-
come and middle-class families. 
Gas prices are up by more than 42 
percent from last year. Bacon is up 17 
percent. Beef is up 12 percent. Eggs are 
up 10 percent. The list goes on and on. 
Meanwhile, wage growth is lagging, 
which means paychecks are stretched 
thinner, making it that much harder 
for families to put dinner on the table 
and pay their bills. 
The President promised not to raise 
taxes on the lower and middle classes, 
but Americans know full well that in-
flation is taxation. This hidden tax is 
hitting families’ checkbooks very hard. 
But instead of slamming the brakes 
on this reckless spending, the majority 
is racing towards more and doubling 
down on their spending spree. 
For example, over the last year, tran-
sit has already received five times the 
funding it typically gets in one year, 
and people aren’t even using it. Despite 
that fact, transit stands to get even 
more in this bill and through reconcili-
ation. 
Worse still, this duplicative spending 
represents another broken promise by 
the President, who agreed not to use 
reconciliation to revisit funding al-
ready addressed in the infrastructure 
bill. 
All in all, these numbers are down-
right frightening. They scare me, and I 
know they scare the farmers and the 
small business owners. They scare 
hardworking constituents across my 
district who know they will pay for it 
in higher taxes and higher prices due to 
inflation. 
A recent poll showed that 6 out of 10 
Americans support pumping the brakes 
on the $3.5 trillion or more spending 
package that is coming on the heels of 
today’s bill. I truly hope the growing 
skepticism 
amongst 
congressional 
Democrats 
about 
that 
package 
is 
enough to bring it to a halt. 
But the fact remains that the infra-
structure bill we are debating today is 
not the real priority for the Speaker 
and the progressives in the majority. 
This has been a horribly managed 
process from the outset, and there was 
never a legitimate effort to work with 
Republicans to find common ground on 
these historically bipartisan issues. 
I have supported all three highway 
bills that have been signed into law 
during my time in Congress, under 
both Republican and Democrat Presi-
dents. It might be a surprise to some, 
but those were all led by Republican 
chairmen in the House. 
Regardless, I never thought I would 
see the House simply take up a major 
infrastructure bill from the other body 
and just vote on it with no input, espe-
cially when so many Members of the 
majority, including the chairman him-
self, expressed displeasure with this 
piece of legislation. 
It begs the question: What is the real 
motivation here for the majority to 
pass this bill? 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD a summary of the bill 
written by the White House. 
HISTORIC BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL 
Today, the President and the bipartisan 
group announced agreement on the details of 
a once-in-a-generation investment in our in-
frastructure, which will be taken up in the 
Senate for consideration. In total, the deal 
includes $550 billion in new federal invest-
ment in America’s infrastructure. The bipar-
tisan infrastructure deal will grow the econ-
omy, enhance our competitiveness, create 
good- jobs, and make our economy more sus-
tainable, resilient, and just. 
The deal will create good-paying, union 
jobs. With the President’s Build Back Better 
Agenda, these investments will add, on aver-
age, around 2 million jobs per year over the 
course of the decade, while accelerating 
America’s path to full employment and in-
creasing labor force participation. 
President Biden believes that we must in-
vest in our country and in our people, by cre-
ating good-paying union jobs, tackling the 
climate crisis, and growing the economy 
sustainably and equitably for decades to 
come. The Bipartisan Infrastructure deal 
will deliver progress towards those objec-
tives for working families across the coun-
try. The Bipartisan Infrastructure deal: 
Makes the largest federal investment in 
public transit ever 
Makes the largest federal investment in 
passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak 
Makes the single largest dedicated bridge 
investment since the construction of the 
interstate highway system 
Makes the largest investment in clean 
drinking water and waste water infrastruc-
ture in American history, delivering clean 
water to millions of families 
Ensures every American has access to reli-
able high-speed internet 
Helps us tackle the climate crisis by mak-
ing the largest investment in clean energy 
transmission and EV infrastructure in his-
tory; electrifying thousands of school and 
transit buses across the country; and cre-
ating a new Grid Development Authority to 
build a clean, 21st century electric grid. 
The President promised to work across the 
aisle to deliver results for working families. 
He believes demonstrating that democracies 
can deliver is a critical challenge for his 
presidency. Today’s agreement shows that 
we can come together to position American 
workers, farmers, and businesses to compete 
and win in the 21st century. 
ROADS, BRIDGES, AND MAJOR PROJECTS 
One in five miles, or 173,000 total miles, of 
our highways and major roads and 45,000 
bridges are in poor condition. Bridges in poor 
condition pose heightened challenges in 
rural communities, which often may rely on 
a single bridge for the passage of emergency 
service vehicles. The Bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture deal will invest $110 billion of new funds 
for roads, bridges, and major projects, and 
reauthorize the surface transportation pro-
gram for the next five years building on bi-
partisan surface transportation reauthoriza-
tion bills passed out of committee earlier 
this year. This investment will repair and re-
build our roads and bridges with a focus on 
climate change mitigation, resilience, eq-
uity, and safety for all users, including cy-
clists and pedestrians. The bill includes a 
total of $40 billion of new funding for bridge 
repair, 
replacement, 
and 
rehabilitation, 
which is the single largest dedicated bridge 
investment since the construction of the 
interstate highway system. The bill also in-
cludes a total of $17.5 billion for major 
projects that are too large or complex for 
traditional funding programs but will deliver 
significant economic benefits to commu-
nities.

ity rates in the industrialized world. The

deal invests $11 billion in transportation 
safety programs, including a new Safe 
Streets for All program to help states and lo-
calities reduce crashes and fatalities in their 
communities, especially for cyclists and pe-
destrians. It will more than double funding 
directed to programs that improve the safety 
of people and vehicles in our transportation 
system, including highway safety, truck 
safety, and pipeline and hazardous materials 
safety. 
PUBLIC TRANSIT 
America’s transit infrastructure is inad-
equate—with a multibillion-dollar repair 
backlog, representing more than 24,000 buses, 
5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of 
miles of track, signals, and power systems in 
need of replacement. The deal invests $39 bil-
lion of new investment to modernize transit, 
and improve accessibility for the elderly and 
people with disabilities, in addition to con-
tinuing the existing transit programs for five 
years as part of surface transportation reau-
thorization. This is the largest Federal in-
vestment in public transit in history, and de-
votes a larger share of funds from surface 
transportation reauthorization to transit in 
the history of the programs. It will repair 
and upgrade aging infrastructure, modernize 
bus and rail fleets, make stations accessible 
to all users, and bring transit service to new 
communities. It will replace thousands of 
transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, 
zero emission vehicles. And, it will benefit 
communities of color since these households 
are twice as likely to take public transpor-
tation and many of these communities lack 
sufficient public transit options. 
PASSENGER AND FREIGHT RAIL 
Unlike highways and transit, rail lacks a 
multi-year funding stream to address de-
ferred maintenance, enhance existing cor-
ridors, and build new lines in high-potential 
locations. The deal positions Amtrak and 
rail to play a central role in our transpor-
tation and economic future. This the largest 
investment in passenger rail since the cre-
ation of Amtrak 50 years ago. The deal in-
vests $66 billion in rail to eliminate the Am-
trak maintenance backlog, modernize the 
Northeast Corridor, and bring world-class 
rail service to areas outside the northeast 
and midAtlantic. Within these totals, $22 
million would be provided as grants to Am-
trak, $24 billion as federal-state partnership 
grants for Northeast Corridor modernization, 
$12 billion for partnership grants for inter-
city rail service, including high-speed rail, $5 
billion for rail improvement and safety 
grants, and $3 billion for grade crossing safe-
ty improvements. 
EV INFRASTRUCTURE 
U.S. market share of plug-in electric vehi-
cle (EV) sales is only one-third the size of 
the Chinese EV market. The President be-
lieves that must change. The bill invests $7.5 
billion to build out a national network of EV 
chargers. This is the first-ever national in-
vestment in EV charging infrastructure in 
the United States and is a critical element in 
the Biden-Harris Administration’s plan to 
accelerate the adoption of EVs to address the 
climate crisis and support domestic manu-
facturing jobs. The bill will provide funding 
for deployment of EV chargers along high-
way corridors to facilitate long-distance 
travel and within communities to provide 
convenient charging where people live, work, 
and shop. Federal funding will have a par-
ticular focus on rural, disadvantaged, and 
hard-to-reach communities. 
ELECTRIC BUSES 
American school buses play a critical role 
in expanding access to education, but they 
are also a significant source of pollution. 
The deal will deliver thousands of electric 
school buses nationwide, including in rural 
communities, helping school districts across 
the country buy clean, American-made, zero 
emission buses, and replace the yellow 
school bus fleet for America’s children. The 
deal invests $2.5 billion in zero emission 
buses, $2.5 billion in low emission buses, and 
$2.5 billion for ferries. These investments 
will drive demand for American-made bat-
teries and vehicles, creating jobs and sup-
porting domestic manufacturing, while also 
removing diesel buses from some of our most 
vulnerable communities. In addition, they 
will help the more than 25 million children 
and thousands of bus drivers who breathe 
polluted air on their rides to and from 
school. Diesel air pollution is linked to asth-
ma and other health problems that hurt our 
communities and cause students to miss 
school, particularly in communities of color 
and Tribal communities. 
RECONNECTING COMMUNITIES 
Too often, past transportation investments 
divided communities—like the Claiborne Ex-
pressway in New Orleans or 1–81 in Syra-
cuse—or it left out the people most in need 
of affordable transportation options. In par-
ticular, significant portions of the interstate 
highway system were built through Black 
neighborhoods. The deal creates a first-ever 
program to reconnect communities divided 
by transportation infrastructure. The pro-
gram will fund planning, design, demolition, 
and reconstruction of street grids, parks, or 
other infrastructure through $1 billion of 
dedicated funding. 
AIRPORTS, PORTS, AND WATERWAYS 
The United States built modem aviation, 
but our airports lag far behind our competi-
tors. According to some rankings, no U.S. 
airports rank in the top 25 of airports world-
wide. Our ports and waterways need repair 
and reimagination too. The bill invests $17 
billion in port infrastructure and $25 billion 
in airports to address repair and mainte-
nance backlogs, reduce congestion and emis-
sions near ports and airports, and drive elec-
trification 
and 
other 
low-carbon 
tech-
nologies. Modem, resilient, and sustainable 
p011, airport, and freight infrastructure will 
support U.S. competitiveness by removing 
bottlenecks and expediting commerce and 
reduce the environmental impact on neigh-
boring communities. 
RESILIENCE AND WESTERN WATER 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Millions of Americans feel the effects of 
climate change each year when their roads 
wash out, airport power goes down, or 
schools get flooded. Last year alone, the 
United States faced 22 extreme weather and 
climate-related disaster events with losses 
exceeding $1 billion each—a cumulative price 
tag of nearly $100 billion. People of color are 
more likely to live in areas most vulnerable 
to flooding and other climate change-related 
weather events. The deal makes our commu-
nities safer and our infrastructure more re-
silient to the impacts of climate change and 
cyber attacks, with an investment of over 
$50 billion. This includes funds to protect 
against droughts and floods. in addition to a 
major investment in weatherization. The bill 
is the largest investment in the resilience of 
physical and natural systems in American 
history. 
CLEAN DRINKING WATER 
Currently, up to 10 million American 
households and 400,000 schools and child care 
centers lack safe drinking water. The deal’s 
$55 billion investment represents the largest 
investment in clean drinking water in Amer-
ican history, including dedicated funding to 
replace lead service lines and the dangerous 
chemical PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl). It 
will replace all of the nation’s lead pipes and 
service lines. From rural towns to struggling 
cities, the deal invests in water infrastruc-
ture across America, including in Tribal Na-
tions and disadvantaged communities that 
need it most. 
HIGH SPEED INTERNET 
Broadband internet is necessary for Ameri-
cans to do their jobs, to participate equally 
in school learning, health care, and to stay 
connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 
30 million Americans live in areas where 
there is no broadband infrastructure that 
provides minimally acceptable speeds—a par-
ticular 
problem 
in 
rural 
communities 
throughout the country. The deal’s $65 bil-
lion investment ensures every American has 
access to reliable high-speed internet with 
an historic investment in broadband infra-
structure deployment, just as the federal 
government made a historic effort to provide 
electricity to every American nearly one 
hundred years ago. 
The bill will also help lower prices for 
internet service by requiring funding recipi-
ents to offer a low-cost affordable plan, by 
creating price transparency and helping fam-
ilies comparison shop, and by boosting com-
petition in areas where existing providers 
aren’t providing adequate service. It will 
also help close the digital divide by passing 
the Digital Equity Act, ending digital red-
lining, creating a permanent program to help 
more low-income households access the 
internet, and establishing a new program to 
help low-income households obtain the de-
vices required to access the internet. 
ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION 
In thousands of rural and urban commu-
nities around the country, hundreds of thou-
sands of former industrial and energy sites 
are now idle—sources of blight and pollution. 
26 percent of Black Americans and 29 percent 
of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of 
a Superfund site, a higher percentage than 
for Americans overall. Proximity to a Super-
fund site can lead to elevated levels of lead 
in children’s blood. The deal invests $21 bil-
lion in environmental remediation, making 
the largest investment in addressing the leg-
acy pollution that harms the public health of 
communities and neighborhoods in American 
history, creating good-paying union jobs in 
hard-hit energy communities and advancing 
economic and environmental justice. The 
bill includes funds to clean up superfund and 
brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine 
land and cap orphaned gas wells. 
POWER INFRASTRUCTURE 
As the recent Texas power outages dem-
onstrated, our aging electric grid needs ur-
gent modernization. A Department of Energy 
study found that power outages cost the U.S. 
economy up to $70 billion annually. The 
deal’s $73 billion investment is the single 
largest investment in clean energy trans-
mission in American history. It upgrades our 
power infrastructure, including by building 
thousands of miles of new, resilient trans-
mission lines to facilitate the expansion of 
renewable energy. It creates a new Grid De-
ployment Authority, invests in research and 
development for advanced transmission and 
electricity distribution technologies, and 
promotes smart grid technologies that de-
liver flexibility and resilience. It invests in 
demonstration projects and research hubs for 
next generation technologies like advanced 
nuclear reactors, carbon capture, and clean 
hydrogen. 
OFFSETS 
In the years ahead, the deal, which will 
generate significant economic benefits, and 
it is financed through a combination of re-
directing unspent emergency relief funds, 
targeted corporate user fees, strengthening 
tax enforcement when it comes to crypto

currencies, and other bipartisan measures, in 
addition to the revenue generated from high-
er economic growth as a result of the invest-
ments. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), the chair of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, let me 
initially associate myself with the 
comments made by Chairman DEFAZIO. 
There is no question that the bill 
that he put together, the INVEST Act 
that passed the House, addresses the 
Nation’s infrastructure needs in a 
much more significant way and ad-
dresses climate action in a much more 
significant way than the bill that is be-
fore us today. 
I do want to say that this bill, the In-
frastructure Investment and Jobs Act, 
while it is an important step forward 
and it is a critical step, it won’t get us 
there on its own. It has to be paired 
with the Build Back Better Act. To-
gether, these two bills will produce 
major progress for the American peo-
ple. But without the Build Back Better 
Act, we will not see the progress that is 
necessary to create jobs and create 
good-paying jobs to advance our recov-
ery from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Now, I want to talk a little bit about 
the legislation before us and the issues 
that are within the jurisdiction of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
The bill before us provides funding to 
improve and repair our Nation’s elec-
tric grid, which is in urgent need of 
modernization. It invests in hardening 
the 
electric 
grid 
against 
extreme 
weather events and gives the govern-
ment new authority to spur the devel-
opment of transmission projects and 
grid-enhancing technologies that are 
necessary to meet our climate goals. 
Our climate goals are immediate. 
Worsening wildfires, droughts, and ex-
treme weather all prove the climate 
crisis is here and becoming more de-
structive each year. It is critical we in-
vest in a more advanced and resilient 
economy. This bill begins to make 
those investments, and the Energy and 
Commerce Committee made the other 
necessary investments in its portion of 
the Build Back Better Act during its 
markup earlier this year. 
Let me just explain. Clean, safe 
drinking water is obviously a basic 
human right. Yet, 10 million American 
households cannot trust the water 
coming out of their taps. This legisla-
tion includes $55 billion in clean water 
funding both for safe drinking water 
and for sewage treatment plants, but 
we need a lot more. That is what we do 
in the Build Back Better Act. 
I am pleased this legislation includes 
dedicated funding to replace lead serv-
ice lines and remove toxic PFAS for-
ever chemicals from local water sys-
tems. 
It also includes funding for electric 
vehicle supply infrastructure. Right 
now, the U.S. market share of plug-in 
and EV sales is only one-third the size 
of China’s. We must do a better job at 
keeping pace with our economic com-
petitors, and the Build Back Better Act 
would do a lot more with regard to 
electric vehicles. 
With broadband, the bill invests $65 
million and marks the beginning of a 
renewed fight to close the digital di-
vide and ensure that every community, 
regardless of ZIP Code, has access to 
reliable high-speed internet. This bill 
also invests in a permanent afford-
ability program, which represents real 
progress on behalf of all families strug-
gling to access and afford a basic inter-
net connection. 
Mr. Speaker, since this bill rep-
resents bipartisan compromise, neither 
Democrats nor Republicans got every-
thing they wanted. I remain concerned 
that it undermines some of our most 
core environmental statutes, like the 
National Environmental Policy Act. 
As Mr. DEFAZIO said, this bill is the 
best we are going to get from the Sen-
ate. That, coupled with the Build Back 
Better Act, will help us revitalize and 
modernize our economy, provide addi-
tional relief to struggling families, and 
combat the worsening climate crisis. 
I do want to explain, once again, that 
I do think we need to couple this with 
the reconciliation bill that has come 
out of the Budget Committee, the 
Build Back Better Act. Otherwise, we 
will not achieve the goals that we 
want. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Alaska (Mr. YOUNG), the dean of 
the House and the former chairman of 
the Transportation and Infrastructure 
Committee. 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding and appre-
ciate the work of the chairman and 
ranking member. 
I rise in support of this legislation. It 
is not what I would have if I was chair-
man. It is not what Mr. DEFAZIO would 
have as chairman, but it is what we 
have got. 
We need infrastructure in this coun-
try now. The last big infrastructure 
bill we passed, Jim Oberstar and my-
self, was $286 billion. We darn near did 
that unanimously. It was the biggest 
one. 
But from that time on, we have not 
raised the money, nor have we put 
what I call the where-for-all in the 
hands to build roads and airports and 
all of the other things, all of the ports. 
Transportation is the economy of this 
great Nation, and we have fallen be-
hind. 
Even in those days when I was chair-
man, I said we needed a trillion dollars, 
and people laughed at me. But the fact 
of the matter is, we did need it. We 
need this bill to make sure that we 
have an economic base for the future 
generations of this great Nation. 
Would I have done it this way? No. I 
would have said: ‘‘Mr. DEFAZIO, Mr. 
GRAVES, members of the committee, 
let’s write a bill together with the Sen-
ate.’’ We don’t have that chance. This 
is the last opportunity we have to 
make sure those potholes are filled, 
those airports are run 
right, 
the 
bridges are safe, and our economy can 
continue to grow. This is the only 
chance we have. 
To my colleagues who are voting 
‘‘no,’’ I say: Think about it. What is 
the other alternative? I don’t tie it to 
the big bill, the $3 trillion whatever. I 
don’t tie it to that. Some people do. 
This is a working piece of legislation 
that will build and put people to work. 
Not only will it put them to work, but 
it is something that provides the eco-
nomic basis for this great Nation. 
I suggest, respectfully, to my side of 
the aisle and to that side of the aisle, 
if we really want to make this Nation 
great again, then let’s pass this legisla-
tion for the construction of the econ-
omy of this great Nation through 
transportation. I ask my colleagues to 
consider that. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. JOHNSON), a member of the com-
mittee. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
as a senior member of the Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure Committee, I 
want to associate my remarks with the 
gentleman who just finished. 
I rise in support of this bill. Among 
the many critical measures included 
are ones that support extreme weather 
resiliency, public transit, as well as 
provide funding for highway construc-
tion and clean energy. 
If each of us had written this bill, we 
would have had that many bills before 
us. It is not a perfect bill, but I would 
ask my colleagues to join me in voting 
‘‘yes.’’ 
b 1930 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle-
woman from Washington (Mrs. ROD-
GERS), the ranking member of the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to this 
bill. We all agree on the need to mod-
ernize and invest in our Nation’s infra-
structure. 
In fact, Energy and Commerce Re-
publicans have led on dozens of bills to 
close the digital divide, increase our 
energy security, clean energy deploy-
ment, make investments in safe drink-
ing water and make our roadways safe. 
Our solutions target Federal invest-
ments that are paired with comprehen-
sive permitting, regulatory, and licens-
ing reforms to reduce barriers to de-
ployment and spur private investment. 
Unfortunately, this bill does not lift 
barriers that make projects expensive, 
and in many cases impossible. 
On energy, this bill’s rush-to-green 
will compromise America’s reliability 
and affordability. 
On broadband, this bill fails to target 
funds to unserved areas based on accu-
rate FCC maps. 
It also ignores the most important 
policy for safer roads: A national 
framework for autonomous vehicles.

Overall, it prioritizes spending and 
investments in urban centers at the ex-
pense of more rural areas of our coun-
try. This is the wrong approach. 
Finally, this bill paves the way for 
the radical, multi-trillion-dollar tax- 
and-spending 
spree 
that 
Speaker 
PELOSI is rewriting behind closed doors 
at this very moment. The programs 
and funding levels agreed to by the 
Senate will be massively expanded in 
her bill. We have already seen this 
from the provisions marked up by our 
committee. 
This tax-and-spending spree will radi-
cally expand the Federal Government’s 
command and control over our lives. It 
will raise costs on families and leave us 
less safe, less prosperous, and more de-
pendent on foreign adversaries like 
China. 
Again, this is not the approach that 
we should take. This is taking us down 
a dangerous road. To win the future, I 
urge my colleagues to reject this bill. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. COHEN), a member of the 
committee. 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I come 
from Memphis, which is a transpor-
tation hub, but I am an American, and 
transportation moves goods and prod-
ucts and creates jobs. 
I am proud to be for this bill. I would 
have preferred having the bill that the 
Transportation Committee came up 
with. We worked until 4 in the morning 
to come up with a bill. 
But that is not reality. This is the 
only bill that in reality can happen. 
This is much more of a Republican bill; 
bipartisan from the Senate, endorsed 
by the Chamber of Commerce, endorsed 
by many, many Republican groups. 
Nobody do I think more of than the 
dean of the House, and I am so happy 
DON YOUNG endorsed this bill. I hope 
more Republicans will join with him. 
This is a good bill for America. I will 
vote for it to move America forward. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I think everybody in this 
body wants an infrastructure bill. We 
all want to see better roads and 
bridges. We want to see more sustain-
able, resilient communities. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill, about half of it 
actually is money for infrastructure. 
About half. 
Looking back over the last few years 
that I have been here, we have been 
able to work through, we have been 
able to cut red tape, break logjams. In 
fact, projects, Mr. Speaker, that date 
back to before I was born, we have been 
able to work through all of the obsta-
cles and impediments and get the au-
thorization in place and get them fund-
ed. 
This bill doesn’t give us a fair shot. 
Let me explain. Mr. Speaker, in the 
law today it describes the criteria for 
how dollars are supposed to be handed 
out under various grant programs. The 
Secretary of Transportation came out 
and ignored all of that and invented his 
own new criteria for climate change, 
for racial equity, and for environ-
mental justice. 
I don’t have any problems with those 
objectives, but what in the world do 
they have to do with transportation? 
When we saw them applied for the first 
time, we saw a community of 30,000 
people get a $92 million grant, and it 
doesn’t have national significance as 
the law requires. 
In the President’s budget for the 
Corps of Engineers, there is language 
in there that says they are going to 
fund projects that promote environ-
mental justice in disadvantaged com-
munities in line with Justice40; they 
are going to fund projects that promote 
a chance to join a union; and that they 
are going to refuse to fund projects 
that help to lower the cost of produc-
tion of energy, lower the cost of con-
sumption of energy, or that raises the 
revenue of energy-producing compa-
nies. 
Mr. Speaker, this doesn’t have any-
thing to do with infrastructure. Why 
are they politically manipulating the 
dollars? As was noted, all the transit 
funds from these bills would fund al-
most 7 billion rides with Lyft or Uber. 
Why are we dumping all this money 
into empty buses? We need to spend it 
on real infrastructure, real priorities in 
a transparent, fair proces. This bill, un-
fortunately, fails to achieve those ob-
jectives. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I was confused by the gentleman’s 
speech. This bill was written by 10 Re-
publican Senators and two conserv-
ative Democrats, and to say half the 
bill isn’t infrastructure, there is a $1 
billion program to rejoin communities 
split asunder. 
The President went down and visited 
one in Louisiana. It is a skyway that 
has to come down. It is falling apart. 
So are we just going to build another 
skyway or are we going to rejoin that 
community? 
In Portland, Oregon, they are talking 
about 
a 
freeway-widening 
project 
there, but they are also going to cap 
that so they can rejoin a neighborhood. 
That is infrastructure, and it is also 
creating community jobs and economic 
development. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Georgia (Ms. BOURDEAUX), a mem-
ber of the committee. 
Ms. BOURDEAUX. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the Infrastruc-
ture Investment and Jobs Act. 
Earlier this year I was honored to 
work as a member of the Problem Solv-
ers Caucus to participate in developing 
the bipartisan infrastructure frame-
work that formed the foundation of 
this legislation. I deeply appreciate my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
and their willingness to work together 
to find common ground. 
In the Seventh District, we know the 
importance of this bill since we have 
one of the worst commutes in the coun-
try. Businesses have left our commu-
nity because of the congestion and lack 
of access to transit. 
The significant increases in funding 
for roads, bridges, transit, high-speed 
rail, electric charging stations, among 
many other investments will help 
unlock 
gridlock, 
spur 
economic 
growth, and make a critical down pay-
ment on tackling climate change. 
I appreciate the work on both sides 
that has gone into crafting this bill. I 
urge all Members to support it. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. SMITH), the ranking 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
Republicans and Democrats agree we 
need to invest in infrastructure, but 
today when our Nation is running his-
torically high deficits, when Democrats 
want to add trillions of dollars to our 
debt, and inflation is nearly at the 
highest it has been in 40 years, we need 
to ensure these investments are paid 
for. 
When it comes to this bill, the math 
simply does not add up. We are told 
that this bill has $589 billion in offsets. 
In reality, the CBO score shows just 
$180 billion in offsets, a $400 billion 
shortfall. 
This bill does not pay for itself, not 
even close. The fact is, for House 
Democrats, this bill was never about 
infrastructure. The Speaker has had 
weeks to vote on it. Instead, she has 
turned a bipartisan negotiation into a 
hostage negotiation. 
In exchange for fixing our roads, 
bridges, highways, and dams, House 
Democrats are demanding Congress 
pass the most expensive piece of legis-
lation in history along with the largest 
tax increase in history. Unlike the in-
frastructure bill, which has a CBO 
score, less than 1 percent of their $4.3 
trillion spending-and-tax plan is scored 
by CBO. 
Republicans will not be bullied into 
paying a ransom to fix our infrastruc-
ture. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
The gentleman who preceded me, of 
course, did not talk about what he 
would do to fix the Nation’s crumbling 
infrastructure: 
42,000 bridges that need replacement 
or repair. 
40 percent of the National Highway 
System degraded to the point where it 
has to be rebedded, not just put a coat 
of asphalt on top. 
A $100 billion backlog to bring tran-
sit up to a state of good repair. On and 
on and on. 
Wastewater, 
drinking 
water. 
The 
needs are incredible. This bill will ad-
dress those things. 
And the rate of return is phe-
nomenal, if you look at analyses by 
Wall Street and others. There is no bet-
ter investment that the Federal Gov-
ernment can make than investment in 
infrastructure. It not only creates jobs,

it creates lasting economic benefits for 
this country, makes us more competi-
tive with the world. 
The gentleman is conflating two dif-
ferent bills. We have one bill before us, 
not being held hostage. We are here de-
bating it. But I didn’t hear your alter-
native. 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
this is not about hijacking America. It 
is about rewarding America. I stand 
here with one bill, the INVEST bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, and, yes, the 
Build Back America—one bill. 
Let me share with you the reasons 
why. This bill on the floor right now, 
the agreement will create good-paying 
union jobs. It will deliver high-speed 
internet to every American, elimi-
nating lead pipes, and providing clean 
drinking water. Something in my dis-
trict that is long overdue. Public tran-
sit. 
But most importantly, it will recon-
nect communities. As we try to over-
come this massive I–45 north in Texas 
where we need the input of the govern-
ment, Federal Government, to make a 
balance between highways and Black 
communities and communities of color 
that are traditionally divided by high-
ways. This bill will do so. And it will 
remedy brownfields and other sites. 
At the same time, we have the rec-
ognition that we deal with people. And 
what does that mean? That is that we 
will have pre-K in our Build Back 
America. We will have expanded Med-
icaid in Build Back America. We will 
have child care for the individuals, 
women in particular, that need to go to 
work. We will have a care economy. We 
will have affordable housing that in-
vests so that people will have safe 
housing. 
This will provide a wholeness. This is 
not a hijacking. It is actually a reward 
that we put two outstanding directions 
of the President’s agenda, President 
Biden’s absolutely progressive, moving 
agenda for all of America. 
We don’t look at America and divide 
her in corners of conservatism and pro-
gressive or right and left. We look at 
her and the needs of her people. I am 
here today to say that I stand with 
America. I stand with working fami-
lies. I stand with women. We must 
move these bills, the INVEST Act, cre-
ating union jobs, turning the corner on 
all the necessities of infrastructure 
and, yes, bringing people into the light 
once and for all. I ask my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, may I inquire as to the time re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MRVAN). The gentleman from Missouri 
has 171⁄2 minutes remaining. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 151⁄2 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN), the 
ranking member of the Natural Re-
sources Committee. 
Mr. 
WESTERMAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
there is no doubt we need infrastruc-
ture funding in this country. Too bad 
we 
couldn’t 
have 
taken 
this 
bill 
through committee and debated that. 
But oh what a tangled web we weave 
when we practice first to deceive. 
Mr. Speaker, my, my, what a tangled 
web of deceit House Democrats have 
woven, with this bill as only one of the 
threads. Let’s take a brief look at a 
couple of the biggest lies that are spun 
in this dangerous web. 
The first lie is that this is a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill. This bill is 
not bipartisan, and Democrats know it. 
You can’t have a bipartisan House bill 
that didn’t go through committee that 
will not go to conference and has no 
Republican amendments. 
If you want a bipartisan bill, then 
stop the deceit. Pull this bill, send it to 
committee, and let’s go through the bi-
partisan process. 
The second lie is that this is an infra-
structure bill. Mr. Speaker, a half 
truth is a lie, and saying this is an in-
frastructure bill is like saying that a 
hurricane is a rain shower. There are 
rain showers in a hurricane, but there 
is so much more, just like there is 
some infrastructure in this bill, but 
there is so much more. 
In fact, this $1.2 trillion bill is just a 
down payment on the $5.5 trillion pack-
age that looks like it was developed at 
a socialist symposium on taxing and 
spending. It is deceitful to say that 
this is a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill. 
It is only the beginning, and it is intri-
cately linked to trillions more. 
This is a down payment on trillions 
more spending that slaps American 
taxpayers in the face with line items 
such as the $200 million line item for 
Speaker PELOSI’s neighborhood golf 
and country club, Presidio Park, that 
is surrounded by billionaires living in 
$30 million homes. 
I urge my colleagues not to adopt 
this bill, which is just the beginning. 
Its passage would be the beginning of 
the end of our country as we know it. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
b 1945 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri for yield-
ing. 
I would like to use this time to high-
light a concern that pops up when we 
are debating bills that pay for water 
storage and conveyance in the Western 
United States, especially given the se-
verity of the drought we face. 
Often my colleagues, understandably, 
wonder why the Federal Government is 
still helping fund the California water 
system. Why California water? It is 
rather simple. Our 77,000 farms and 
ranches top the production charts in at 
least 77 different goods, from dairy to 
fruits to vegetables. 
California is actually the only pro-
ducer of almonds, artichokes, celery, 
figs, garlic, raisins, kiwis, honeydew, 
nectarines, olives, cling peaches, pis-
tachios, plums, sweet rice, and walnuts 
in the United States. If it isn’t made 
there, you are not going to get it from 
this country; it will be imported. 
This incredible system was set up as 
a partnership between the Federal and 
State governments. Although $1 billion 
in this program is a decent start, when 
we are talking $100 billion to keep sup-
porting the high-speed rail boondoggle 
in California, we see our priorities are 
misplaced. 
More money needs to be put in for 
water storage to help all Americans 
and less for all these other things that 
do not help. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 2 minutes. 
The events that led up to this bill 
were pretty messy and painful; I agree 
with that. 
Unfortunately, given the dysfunction 
on the other side of the Hill, called the 
Senate—absurd rules like the fili-
buster, where you have to have a super-
majority to do anything, and I don’t 
know how many bills the House has 
sent over that are sitting there that 
would serve the American people well; 
and then the Byrd rule, which we are 
going deal with later, a rule written by 
a Senator dead for 12 years, a rule writ-
ten 28 years ago where the Parliamen-
tarian holds a seance to find out what 
can go in and not go in the bill. That is 
what we are dealing with. 
If we are going to make the invest-
ments that we need in our infrastruc-
ture—and I don’t think there is any-
body on the other side of the aisle that 
disagrees, when you see the ratings 
from the American Society of Civil En-
gineers, when you see the water mains 
blowing up and flooding streets, when 
you see the sewers backing up into peo-
ple’s houses or overflowing into the 
river or, without the resilience we need 
because of climate change, have them 
getting overrun during severe weather 
events. 
These are investments that America 
needs, and I am still not hearing from 
the other side of the aisle their plan to 
make these needed investments, put 
millions of Americans to work in very 
good-paying family wage jobs, and to 
make America more competitive. 
Yes, I wish the Senate bill had been 
different. I wish, for instance, they had 
taken our provisions to put some pred-
atory Chinese companies out of busi-
ness. I don’t know, I guess they have a 
very good lobbyist over there on the 
Senate side. 
There are many things like that that 
were neglected in this bill that would 
have provided more American jobs. But 
there are millions of jobs attached to 
this bill. We need those jobs. We need 
the investment. We need to rebuild 
America.

er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman

ranking member of the Railroads, 
Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The legislation we are debating today 
is the product of months of partisan 
games and agendas. Rather than com-
ing to the table for good faith negotia-
tions, the Democrats crafted a plan to 
pass their progressive policies and so-
cialist human infrastructure programs. 
Americans understand the need for 
real infrastructure investment. They 
are asking Congress to modernize our 
roads, bridges, water systems, and 
rural broadband. 
We had an opportunity to do just 
that, but my colleagues on the left in-
sisted on using the true infrastructure 
needs of Americans as a bargaining 
chip for their irresponsible spending 
spree. 
On the floor today is $1.2 trillion to-
ward a wish list of Green New Deal 
policies that perpetually leave rural 
America behind. It favors transpor-
tation modes that Americans aren’t 
using, including $66 billion for pas-
senger rail like Amtrak, and fails to in-
clude the Republican cost-cutting pro-
posals like reforming the NEPA proc-
ess. 
This will be followed by another $31⁄2 
trillion check, piling onto the rapidly 
increasing national debt and resulting 
inflation. 
At the end of this week, we are facing 
significant deadlines for funding the 
government 
and 
surface 
transpor-
tation. We have known these deadlines 
were coming for months, yet Demo-
crats have pushed us to the wire, doing 
exactly what we know Americans hate: 
forcing a vote on sweeping legislation 
and outrageous spending in the final 
hours. 
I will be voting against this legisla-
tion, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to the time remaining on each 
side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 131⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Mis-
souri has 131⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 2 minutes. 
That was incredible. This is the 
Green New Deal bill? It includes ROD-
NEY DAVIS’ provision from the House 
side, which guts the NEPA process. 
That is not exactly a Green New Deal 
priority. 
It cut dramatically the investments 
in the House bill in transit and rail, 
not exactly the Green New Deal pri-
ority. 
That is absurd. You want to drag out 
this chimera. ‘‘Oh, look, it is the Green 
New Deal.’’ No, it is not the Green New 
Deal. It is a bill written by 10 Repub-
lican Senators and two conservative 
Democrats coming from the Senate 
side, which is not, in my opinion, doing 
near enough to address climate change 
impacts from fossil fuel transportation, 
our largest contributor. 
Now, of course, on your side of the 
aisle, climate change doesn’t exist. You 
want to have a bill for resilience. Why 
do you need resilience? Why is the sea 
level rising? Why are we having incred-
ible, 
unprecedented 
severe 
weather 
events or like the heat dome in Oregon, 
where people died? 
Why are we having these things? 
‘‘Oh, it is a natural occurrence like the 
Ice Age or whatever.’’ It is not. It is 
real, and this bill does not do enough 
to deal with it. 
I intend to continue to fight to do 
more to deal with climate change, no 
matter how much you want to deny it 
on that side of the aisle. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to this sloppy $1 
trillion infrastructure package. This 
bill was advertised as fully paid for, 
Mr. Speaker. That is a lie. It includes 
$550 billion in new spending and will 
add almost $400 billion to the national 
debt. 
Yes, this bill includes funding for 
roads, bridges, railways, waterways, 
and broadband. Unfortunately, just 23 
percent, or $127 billion, is for these pro-
grams. 
This legislation also includes the 
largest Federal investment in Amtrak, 
which just posted an $801 million oper-
ating loss and has never turned a profit 
in its 50-year history. 
That is typical government business, 
Mr. Speaker. Nobody in their right 
mind would invest in a financial sink-
hole like Amtrak, but Congress sure as 
heck will. They have become very fond 
of throwing money at programs that 
just don’t work. 
Electric vehicle owners don’t pay 
their fair share in taxes toward main-
taining the roads they drive on, but 
this bill has special carveouts for these 
folks. There is $7.5 billion for electric 
vehicle charging stations in this legis-
lation. Folks who drive these cars are 
extremely wealthy, as nearly 80 per-
cent of the electric vehicle owners 
make more than $100,000 in income and 
already seek tax credits for owning 
these cars. 
Worse of all, this bill increases Fed-
eral bureaucrats’ influence over local 
infrastructure projects. The United 
States Department of Transportation 
is a mile down the street from the Cap-
itol Building here in D.C., not in east 
Tennessee. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire about two things of the Chair. 
How much time remains on either side, 
and since we are ending the debate be-
fore we are finishing the debate, which 
side gets to close? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Oregon has 12 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Missouri 
has 121⁄2 minutes remaining. There is 
no right to close at this point in the 
proceedings. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, could 
you repeat that? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is 
no right to close at this point in the 
proceedings. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
I hear the chairman talk about in-
vestment. Let me tell you about the 
last investment of this type. We were 
giving, I don’t know, a $100 billion 
slush fund to the Secretary of Energy, 
Secretary Granholm. When she was 
Governor of Michigan, she invested $874 
million of your taxpayer dollars into, I 
don’t know, eight energy companies. 
Four of them went bankrupt within 6 
years. 
A123 Systems, the worst of them, re-
ceived a combined $350 million in Fed-
eral and State subsidies. What hap-
pened? Less than 6 months later, it was 
sold to the Chinese for $257 million, a 
$100 million loss. 
Let me tell you where this invest-
ment is headed. It is headed to where 
the U.K. and the rest of Europe is head-
ed. 
Right now in Britain, their energy 
markets, U.K. electricity prices went 
up 700 percent, and a 250 percent in-
crease in gas prices in the U.K. Ger-
many’s electricity benchmark has dou-
bled this year. 
That is where we are headed with 
this investment. That is where we are 
headed, ladies and gentlemen. Ameri-
cans are already experiencing this. 
Don’t let them do it. Don’t vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. NEHLS). 
Mr. NEHLS. Mr. Speaker, there is 
nothing bipartisan about this bill. 
Speaker PELOSI made it clear: What-
ever far left socialist priorities didn’t 
make it into this bill would be taken 
care of in reconciliation. That is what 
we are really here to do today. 
The total price tag of this infrastruc-
ture bill plus reconciliation is $4.7 tril-
lion. American people, listen: 4.7, t, 
trillion dollars. 
It is difficult to visualize a number so 
mind-bogglingly wasteful. If we started 
stacking $4.7 trillion bills one on top of 
each other, that stack would be 317,971 
miles tall. That is enough to go to the 
Moon and a third of the way back. 
This is beyond wasteful. It is dis-
gusting, irresponsible, and unneces-
sary. The bill would put our national 
debt over $30 trillion. 
When is enough enough? This is sad-
dling our children and grandchildren 
with debt that literally goes to the 
Moon. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
There seems to be confusion on the 
other side of the aisle. I am hearing a

lot of different numbers. There is one 
bill before us today. The gentleman 
says it is not bipartisan. Eighteen Re-
publican Senators voted for it. Grant-
ed, neither of his illustrious Senators 
from his State voted for it, but 18 Re-
publican Senators did vote for it. 
The numbers keep jumping around. 
We have one bill before us today, not 
the other one you want to debate. We 
have one bill before us that will build 
America’s infrastructure, a long-over-
due investment. We haven’t increased 
investment 
substantially 
since 
the 
Clinton era. It has fallen apart. If you 
deny that, I have nothing more to say. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Missouri for yield-
ing. 
Mr. Speaker, the $1.2 trillion Trans-
portation and Infrastructure bill is 100 
percent 
coupled, 
linked, 
dependent 
upon the $3.5 trillion partisan rec-
onciliation bill. 
As our colleagues in the Democratic 
Party continue to remind us and af-
firm, investing in our Nation’s trans-
portation and infrastructure is a core 
function of government, and this bill is 
something I and many other Repub-
licans and Members have tried hard to 
support. 
Unfortunately, the Democrat leader-
ship has made it patently clear that to 
pass this infrastructure bill, we must 
pass a completely partisan $5 trillion 
budget reconciliation bill with the 
largest tax hike and government ex-
pansion in the history of our Nation. 
That I cannot support. 
b 2000 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 10 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Oregon 
has 111⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We are going to close the debate for to-
night and continue this debate tomor-
row. Perhaps Summit will come back 
to planet Earth. 
Mr. Speaker, look, very simply, we 
are looking at a record investment in 
our crumbling infrastructure. I will 
just repeat it one more time: 42,000 
bridges on the national highway sys-
tem in need of serious repair or re-
placement; 40 percent of the National 
Highway 
System 
needs 
to 
be 
re-
bedded—that is totally rebuilt. That is 
expensive, not just another coat of as-
phalt on top, because it has been ne-
glected for so long. 
This is costing Americans every year 
a thousand bucks for car repair, blown- 
out tires, misaligned front ends when 
they hit these potholes. 
Americans want this done. Yeah, it is 
going to increase investment in tran-
sit; $100 billion-dollar backlog to bring 
transit to a state of good repair in this 
country. 
We have the strongest Buy America 
requirements of any part of the govern-
ment. There were two potential prob-
lems with Chinese-owned industries. 
Unfortunately, the Senate couldn’t see 
their way to close those. But the pre-
dominant amount of this money—and 
those loopholes have already been par-
tially closed from other legislation I 
put through—will be spent on Amer-
ican jobs, American manufacturing 
made here in the United States of 
America, another key part of the Presi-
dent’s proposal. Bring it home. Make it 
here. Rebuild our country. To be con-
tinued. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further 
consideration of the motion to concur 
in Senate amendment to H.R. 3684 is 
postponed.

NATIONAL CHOCOLATE MILK DAY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to cele-
brate Penn State University’s Berkey 
Creamery on their 2021 award for Best 
Whole Chocolate Milk. It only seems 
fitting to announce this award today, 
on National Chocolate Milk Day. 
The creamery took home this award 
on August 30 at the World Dairy Expo 
Championship Dairy Product Contest. 
And I can attest it is delicious. 
Whole milk is the number one pro-
vider of nine essential nutrients as well 
as a great deal of long-term benefits. 
Millions 
of 
Americans 
nationwide 
enjoy it. In fact, 70 percent of milk 
consumed is flavored, with chocolate 
milk being the most popular. But milk 
consumption is declining, and due to 
misguided public policy, this nutritious 
beverage was removed from the Na-
tional Lunch Program. 
Earlier this year, my colleague, Mr. 
ANTONIO DELGADO and I introduced the 
Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. This 
legislation would provide our students 
with the nutrient-rich beverage by 
bringing flavored and unflavored whole 
milk back into the school cafeterias. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to celebrate today with a large 
glass of chocolate milk. 
f 
RAISE THE DEBT CEILING 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
George Washington fought for the Na-
tion. Abraham Lincoln tried to unify 
it. 
I am absolutely stunned that the 
United States Senate would not uphold 
its responsibility to pay America’s 
bills—the bills that we have paid over 
and over again—by refusing to raise 
the debt ceiling for some foolish tom-
foolery of politics. What is our Nation 
up to? What are the Republicans up to? 
But I do want to say as well that I 
look forward to the budget reconcili-
ation or the Build Back America and 
the INVEST Act traveling the same 
pathway because my district needs the 
extra $20 million that we had estab-
lished here in the House to be able to 
help the corridor along Scott Street 
where Texas Southern University is 
and the University of Houston, a ma-
jority university and a historically 
Black university. 
We have to get to work. We have to 
realize that the importance of con-
necting neighborhoods that lost the 
connectiveness because of major high-
ways is crucial— like I45 North that di-
vided the community; like 288, that is 
already there, that has divided commu-
nities of color. 
Let’s do the right thing and stand for 
the American people. Politics has no 
place for deciding whether people have 
clean water, whether people have roads 
that work and mobility, and, of course, 
broadband. 
Madam Speaker, let’s stand with the 
American people. 
f 
BIDEN’S 2007 BORDER POLICY 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. ‘‘Ladies and gentle-
men, no great country can say it is se-
cure without being able to control its 
borders. Period. What I would do about 
it is what I proposed to do about it al-
most 13 years ago. I would radically 
ramp up the number of border security 
guards we have and increase the use of 
electronic surveillance material we 
have to guard the border.’’ 
Now, which politician said those 
words back on the campaign trail back 
in 2007? 
Here is another quote for you: ‘‘We 
simply cannot allow people to pour 
into the United States undetected, un-
documented, unchecked, and circum-
venting the line of people who are wait-
ing patiently, diligently, and lawfully 
to become immigrants in this coun-
try.’’ 
That wasn’t President Trump. That 
wasn’t even a Republican. Those com-
monsense border policy quotes you 
heard came from none other than 
President Biden and President Obama. 
Those words reveal the Democrats do 
know what is needed to fix our border 
crisis, but they are too afraid of what 
the liberal media and the progressive 
left would do in order to act. 
So I call on President Biden to listen 
to his own advice and do what needs to 
be done because ‘‘no great country can 
say it is secure without being able to 
control its own borders. Period.’’

Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor John 
Burke of Savannah, Georgia, who sadly 
passed away on September 17 at the 
age of 91. 
John served his community by shar-
ing his passion for sports and the out-
doors through his writing. A native of 
Maine, John began his life in the 
Coastal Empire when he was stationed 
as a Marine at Parris Island, South 
Carolina. After leaving the Marine 
Corps, John began his career as a re-
porter with the Savannah Morning 
News where he worked for over 50 
years. 
John’s passion for life and the out-
doors inspired him to document his 
travels to Alaska. A recipient of many 
honors throughout his lifetime, John’s 
most cherished memory was being the 
grand marshal of the 2007 Savannah, 
Saint Patrick’s Day Parade. 
As a devoted outdoorsman, John 
served the Savannah community as an 
advocate for hunting and fishing con-
servation. 
I am grateful for John’s service to his 
country and community, and I know 
his impact will never be forgotten.

BIDEN’S ASSAULT ON AMERICAN 
ENERGY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BUSH). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 4, 2021, the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I ask that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and submit extra-
neous materials. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, we are here tonight as mem-
bers of the House Energy Action Team 
to discuss the Biden administration’s 
assault on American energy. 
His policies have hurt our constitu-
ents, and tonight, members of the 
HEAT team will talk about how these 
actions continue to harm their dis-
tricts. The last 9 months have painted 
a portrait of what the Biden adminis-
tration’s energy policies mean for our 
country. 
Madam Speaker, it is not a pretty 
picture. As we speak, Biden’s allies in 
Congress intend to pass their $3.5 tril-
lion budget reconciliation package, 
only making this situation worse. 
Let’s take the natural gas tax, for ex-
ample. It will increase everyday Amer-
icans’ bills by hundreds of dollars and 
destroy 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
American family-sustaining jobs. This 
will rob opportunity from the very 
communities that I represent in Penn-
sylvania and hundreds of towns just 
like this. And we will hear more about 
that this evening. 
This tax is a solution in search of a 
problem, and it is creating that prob-
lem. The United States has led the 
world in reducing greenhouse emissions 
in the last two decades, and the energy 
industry is voluntarily reducing meth-
ane emissions. 
Innovation is the ultimate answer to 
cutting emissions, and we cannot af-
ford to stifle advancement. As a Na-
tion, we cannot tax our way to a clean-
er environment. And Americans are fed 
up with taxes. The biggest tax that our 
citizens are now facing is inflation. 
Across the board, prices are rising. 
The energy sector is particularly 
worrisome with gas prices climbing 63 
percent in my home State of Pennsyl-
vania. This cost falls disproportion-
ately on low-income Americans. It is 
not fair for them to foot the bill for the 
policy preferences of liberal coastal 
elites. 
Let’s take another example of the 
Biden administration’s war on Amer-
ican industry. In their attempts to 
enact provisions of the Green New 
Deal, they have smothered American 
innovation. For years, our Nation has 
been at the cutting edge in nearly 
every sector of the economy. From 
cyberspace to advances in manufac-
turing, America has always stayed one 
step ahead of its competition. But that 
is starting to change. 
American researchers and developers 
have always been able to count on the 
access to the resources needed to man-
ufacture new pioneering products. But 
a rising China threatens that access. 
Of the 35 essential minerals listed for 
the U.S. economic and national secu-
rity, China is the top producer or top 
supplier of 23 of them. China controls 
the production of 80 percent of rare 
earth elements, 70 percent of graphite, 
almost 60 percent of lithium, and al-
most 60 percent of vanadium, and 36 
percent of cobalt. 
Products like batteries and semi-
conductors that are needed in the lib-
erals’ remaking of America require 
large amounts of these rare earth ele-
ments. 
The good news is we have them, right 
here within our borders. The bad news 
is that under the Biden administra-
tion’s burdensome regulations, compa-
nies are unable to mine these very ele-
ments that are under the ground that 
we stand on. We need to unshackle the 
American worker and allow businesses 
to extract these minerals so that we 
can make the products of the future 
right here at home instead of relying 
on foreign rivals. 
As the last 9 months have clearly 
shown, these policies are not the right 
way forward. Congress must continue 
to embrace the bottom-up innovation 
that will result in leaps in efficiency 
far greater than any mandate—instead 
of expensive taxes that will take 
money out of working Americans’ 
pockets. 
We have a great group of colleagues 
here tonight from the House Energy 
Action Team to talk about how their 
communities are being affected by this 
administration. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address the Biden admin-
istration’s attack on American energy 
production. 
Last month, as America faced 40 per-
cent higher prices at the pump as a re-
sult of his failed policies, President 
Biden found himself begging OPEC to 
open the valve to alleviate the pinch of 
skyrocketing prices. To no one’s sur-
prise, OPEC refused. 
Earlier this year, in a baffling se-
quence of events on his very first day 
in office, President Biden canceled the 
Keystone XL pipeline project, elimi-
nating 11,000 U.S. energy jobs here at 
home. 
b 2015 
And then he gave a green light to 
Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline across 
Europe. Perhaps most appalling is that 
the Nord Stream 2 decision was made 
in the wake of Russian hackers shut-
ting down the Colonial Pipeline, affect-
ing tens of millions of American up and 
down the East coast. 
These misguided policy decisions by 
the Biden administration have caused 
irreparable harm, not just to the U.S., 
but also to our European allies who are 
growing increasingly weary of how the 
Kremlin may use its newfound grasp on 
the region’s energy supplies to advance 
their geopolitical influence. 
Destroying American energy produc-
tion under the false pretense that 
doing so is somehow saving the envi-
ronment is nothing more than a mis-
match of problems and solutions. It is 
a disastrous display of virtue-signaling. 
Meanwhile, in the midst of soaring 
inflation, American taxpayers are the 
ones left paying the price, robbed of 
both reliable energy options and their 
hard-earned money. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration’s policies are damaging Amer-
ican energy independence and security. 
We must reverse course and return to a 
path of American energy leadership, 
not foreign reliance. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. BALDERSON. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. WALBERG). 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania. 
Madam Speaker, last week, the U.S. 
Energy Information Administration re-
ported that Russia is now the number 
two oil importer to the U.S.—let that 
sink in—behind only Canada. Russian 
oil imports increased by 23 percent in 
May to nearly 850,000 barrels a day 
from the previous month. 
Up until the Biden administration 
took over, we were energy secure and 
no longer dependent upon Middle East 
oil. Now President Biden is asking

OPEC to pump more oil while he shuts 
down 
domestic 
production, 
putting 
America last. 
The message is clear, President Biden 
is pro-Russia and OPEC energy, but 
anti-American energy. He is pro-Rus-
sian pipelines, but anti-American pipe-
lines. 
In January, President Biden canceled 
the Keystone XL pipeline. He then 
withdrew sanctions the Trump admin-
istration put in place, enabling Rus-
sia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline to transfer 
natural gas to Germany without navi-
gating its way through Ukraine. 
We know pipelines are the safest and 
most efficient way to transport energy 
products. 
Even 
Energy 
Secretary 
Granholm admitted this in the wake of 
the Colonial cyberattack. And yet, we 
are witnessing attacks from the left on 
energy infrastructure in every corner 
of the Nation. 
In Michigan, Governor Whitmer has 
ordered the shutdown of Line 5, despite 
it earning all of the necessary permits 
and environmental reviews at both the 
State and the Federal level. 
Line 5 carries 540,000 barrels a day of 
crude oil and natural gas and serves 
more than 50 percent of Michigan’s pro-
pane needs. Shutting it down would 
threaten thousands of jobs, billions in 
economic output, and the safe supply 
of resources necessary to meet Michi-
gan families’ most basic needs. 
Make no mistake: there are con-
sequences to these actions. We saw 
what happened earlier this year when 
just one pipeline shut down. What will 
happen when Democrats shut down all 
of the pipelines, ban oil and natural 
gas, and make us 100 percent dependent 
on renewables sourced from China? 
This is a stark vision for our future, 
and even more so for our grand-
children’s future. 
So I would ask my Democratic col-
leagues to stop placating the radical 
green lobby, and instead, work with us 
in a bipartisan manner to develop real, 
long-term solutions that deploy more 
clean energy and reduce emissions 
through innovation and technology. 
This all makes sense, and it is Amer-
ican. 
American ingenuity during the shale 
revolution enabled us to become the 
world’s energy leader. We must not 
surrender this role to adversaries by 
hamstringing 
ourselves 
with 
Green 
New Deal mandates that make no 
sense, will not work, and that will dev-
astate our great Nation while doing 
nothing, nothing to improve our global 
air quality. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Michigan for his candor. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
BURCHETT), my friend. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. JOYCE for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, take a look at the 
average cost of a gallon of gasoline. 
When President Biden took office, a 
gallon of gasoline was $2.38 a gallon. 
Today, that number is $3.18, an in-
crease of 33.6 percent. 33.6 percent, 
Madam Speaker. It wasn’t too long ago 
Americans could fill up their tanks for 
a little over $2 a gallon. 
President Biden’s attacks on reliable 
fossil fuel sources are hitting middle 
class Americans directly in their wal-
lets. Inflating gas prices are a tax on 
working Americans when they go to 
the pump for their commute to work or 
a vacation with their families. 
And it is nothing short of hypocrisy, 
Madam Speaker, that President Biden 
has tried to close Federal lands for 
drilling but lifted sanctions on Russia’s 
Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Russia is al-
lowed to utilize its own domestic en-
ergy resources, but our country is not. 
Let that sink in. 
President Biden’s solution to energy 
problems 
he 
created 
is 
to 
push 
unproven 
renewable 
technology 
on 
Americans. This includes solar panels, 
which are celebrated by the far left as 
the future of renewable energy. But 
there is a dark secret to solar panels, 
Madam Speaker. Over half of the 
world’s polysilicon, a crucial material 
in solar panel production, is mined 
using Uighur slave labor in China’s 
Xinjiang Province. 
Forget the outrageous cost of one of 
these solar panels. Exploiting slave 
labor to charge your electric car or 
power your house with clean energy 
isn’t worth it, Madam Speaker. 
Wealthy liberals might feel really 
good about that solar panel on the roof 
of their vacation home, but before they 
lecture the rest of us about clean en-
ergy, they should think twice about 
how that solar panel was made. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Tennessee. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Georgia 
(Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding 
and for doing this tonight. This is ex-
tremely important, and I appreciate 
his leadership on that. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden adminis-
tration has been waging a war on 
American energy and energy jobs since 
his first day in office. Of course, on 
President Biden’s first day in office, he 
killed over 11,000 American jobs, which 
were created by the Keystone pipeline. 
Then the administration banned new 
energy leases that will cost 500,000 
American jobs by 2040. Then he reen-
tered the U.S. into the Paris Agree-
ment that will destroy our competi-
tiveness and reduce employment in the 
U.S. by 2.7 million jobs in 2025. 
If that wasn’t bad enough, the admin-
istration will destroy what high-paying 
jobs are remaining in our energy sector 
with this reconciliation package. It in-
cludes a devastating tax on natural 
gas. By taxing it more, we will 
disincentivize the continued transition 
away from dirtier fuels. 
It will increase global emissions by 
giving foreign adversaries a competi-
tive advantage exporting energy. This 
will also jeopardize American energy 
security. Taxing natural gas is de-
signed to push us to use more wind and 
solar energy. 
But just this week it was reported 
that energy prices in Europe are hit-
ting record highs as their increased de-
pendence on wind power has failed to 
be consistently reliable. It would be a 
cold and dark winter in places like Eu-
rope and California if there was not 
natural gas available this year. This 
again demonstrates how we must con-
tinue to pursue an all-of-the-above en-
ergy strategy. 
Then there are the giveaways to the 
richest in America. The President’s 
massive socialist wish list subsidizes 
electric vehicles, despite the fact that 
the average owner of an electric vehi-
cle makes well over six figures. 
Perhaps worst of all is the pursuit of 
all of these policies with the absolute 
and arrogant certainty that it will re-
duce emissions. However, it will likely 
reverse the progress we have already 
made reducing emissions. 
The Paris Agreement allows for the 
world’s worst polluters to continue pol-
luting well into the future. The use of 
lower emission natural gas instead of 
other fossil fuels is largely responsible 
for the enormous reduction of Amer-
ican emissions over the past couple of 
decades. 
But instead of embracing that suc-
cess, the President proposes taxing it 
into oblivion and picking his winners 
and losers. We saw how that worked 
out with Solyndra. We are sacrificing 
growth and prosperity for American 
families in the name of political pos-
turing. 
This is too heavy of a price for a pol-
icy that will not better our environ-
ment or make us energy independent. 
Democratic proposals will lead to high-
er energy prices, reduce the reliability 
of electricity for many communities, 
and take away good paying jobs. 
We had a witness on the Select Com-
mittee on the Climate Crisis make an 
excellent point. Killing jobs connected 
to fossil fuels, like coal and gas, has al-
ready destroyed communities years ago 
and they have never recovered. The 
very same may happen to healthy, 
thriving communities that have relied 
on good paying oil and gas jobs for gen-
erations. 
These are good jobs. Often these are 
the only jobs in rural areas. Destroying 
these jobs will only further the dis-
parity between urban and rural Amer-
ica. 
Madam Speaker, I urge this Presi-
dent to support all Americans and stop 
his war on American energy, and I 
thank the gentleman for sponsoring 
this tonight. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Georgia, especially for raising the im-
portant point of the all-of-the-above 
approach to energy. But above all, we 
need to maintain the great jobs that 
comes from the fuels that are under 
our feet.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5456 
September 27, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I would yield to the 
gentleman from the great State of 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Pennsylvania for 
having this really important conversa-
tion. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since 
day 
one, 
President Biden has made his priorities 
abundantly clear to the American peo-
ple: 
Keystone XL pipeline? Canceled. 
Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline? Ap-
proved. 
Domestic oil and gas protection on 
Federal lands? Canceled. 
Increased Russian and OPEC oil pro-
duction? Approved. 
If this picture still isn’t black and 
white enough, allow me to clarify fur-
ther. President Biden and his adminis-
tration continue to support and pro-
mote foreign energy development and 
foreign jobs, while quite literally can-
celing American energy development 
and eliminating good-paying American 
jobs. 
These actions have led to higher en-
ergy prices, increased costs of goods 
and services, and—most egregiously— 
greater reliance on foreign countries. 
As stockpiles of natural gas continue 
to deplete, world leaders, including 
President Biden, are going to have to 
answer the call for increased fuel de-
mand, especially as winter gets closer. 
As the chairman of the Congressional 
Western Caucus and a member of the 
House Energy Action Team, I have 
worked with all our Members, as well 
as our partners, to highlight the im-
pacts of President Biden’s decisions 
and what they have done to our rural 
communities across the country: from 
decreased public school funding to forc-
ing small businesses to close their 
doors. 
Earlier this month, our colleagues 
from across the aisle, who serve on the 
House 
Committee 
on 
Natural 
Re-
sources all voted to ban onshore as well 
as offshore oil and natural gas produc-
tion. They seem to forget that the fees 
that are generated by these activities 
go straight into the Land and Water 
Conservation Fund, which those very 
same Members voted to support last 
Congress. It makes no sense. 
The U.S. is the greatest country in 
the world, and we have the ability, 
once again, to achieve energy inde-
pendence, provide affordable and reli-
able energy for our citizens, as well as 
supporting our allies. We just need our 
leaders to have these priorities as well. 
Our President should support Amer-
ican jobs, not Russian jobs; he should 
support lower gas prices, not higher 
gas prices; he should support American 
energy dominance, not foreign energy 
production and reliance. 
Madam Speaker, I would encourage 
all of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle, and in the White House, to 
reassess their priorities, support poli-
cies that help the American people, and 
not hinder them. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. JOYCE, 
and I truly appreciate the opportunity 
to speak on a very important issue for 
the American people. 
b 2030 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague from 
the State of Washington and chairman 
of the Congressional Western Caucus 
for his insights and for taking the time 
this evening to present those. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Georgia 
(Mr. ALLEN), who is my friend and who 
is, more importantly, going to discuss 
the impacts in his State of Georgia. 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. JOYCE for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, under the Trump 
administration and the Republican ma-
jority, our Nation was energy inde-
pendent for the first time in my life-
time. 
Sadly, after everything we did to be-
come more energy independent and 
grow our economy, President Biden 
and the Democrats have done the oppo-
site. As a result of the Biden adminis-
tration’s policies, American jobs have 
been destroyed and families are paying 
more for everything. 
The fact that Biden begged OPEC and 
Saudi Arabia to boost oil output be-
cause Americans have been paying over 
40 percent more at the gas pump is a 
sobering example of this weak leader-
ship, and it demonstrates how this ad-
ministration’s 
constant 
assault 
on 
American energy has embarrassed us 
on the world stage. 
To make matters worse, the Demo-
crats are marching full steam ahead 
with more job-destroying and cost-rais-
ing policies as part of their $3.5 trillion 
tax and spending spree. For example, 
their proposed natural gas tax would 
eliminate up to 90,000 jobs in just the 
first year of the program. 
Whose side are they on? 
It is also alarming that Democrats 
are proposing $150 billion to mandate 
deployment of clean energy that is 
manufactured in China, while at the 
same time China is building hundreds 
of coal-powered electric generation 
plants around the world. They have got 
to be laughing at us. 
This massive package—which, by the 
way, we still don’t have the full cost 
details 
yet—will 
punish 
American 
households 
and 
consumers 
through 
higher costs while sending good paying 
jobs overseas. 
Like I said: Whose side are they on? 
Sadly, this isn’t anything new. Presi-
dent Biden has continued to hand our 
adversaries like Russia and China vic-
tory after victory while chipping away 
at our energy dominance. 
Madam Speaker, I urge President 
Biden and the Democrats to put Ameri-
cans first by ending their war on fossil 
fuels and instead work with Repub-
licans on policies that will get our Na-
tion back on the road to energy inde-
pendence. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I would like to point out how 
essential coal, oil, and natural gas 
pipelines are to my district in Pennsyl-
vania. These are valuable resources 
that enhance our ability to provide 
low-cost energy to the American peo-
ple. Yet President Biden’s decision to 
cancel the Keystone XL project while 
allowing Russia to continue to export 
more and more natural gas puts our 
national security at risk. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Pennsylvania 
for organizing this event this evening 
and yielding. 
For the last 8 months, America’s en-
ergy employers and the individuals 
they employ are suffering a barrage of 
attacks from the Biden White House, 
all because this administration is fix-
ated on dismantling America’s energy 
independence and replacing it with a 
radical pipe dream called the Green 
New Deal. 
In Pennsylvania and across America, 
it is not just the energy producers and 
their workers who are feeling the im-
pacts of President Biden’s attack on 
American energy. Our schools, hos-
pitals, local governments, and down-
stream job creators are also suffering. 
Pennsylvania’s natural gas industry 
has created incredible partnerships 
that are working to ensure we can 
meet America’s energy needs right 
here at home. 
The School of Petroleum and Natural 
Gas 
at 
Lackawanna 
College’s 
Tunkhannock Center is introducing 
students to career opportunities in the 
oil and natural gas industry. The Sus-
quehanna County Career & Technology 
Center is working to retain local talent 
by offering a CDL training program 
that offers students the chance to jump 
into an in-demand career. 
When President Biden dismantles 
American energy, these are the organi-
zations and people who suffer. He is 
dismantling American dreams. 
Higher prices at the pump, energy 
shortages, and increased costs to fuel 
our businesses and homes are a clear 
sign that we must embrace American 
energy, not abandon it. We must invest 
in pipelines and refineries, harden our 
grid from cyberattacks, and cultivate 
innovation to ensure future success. 
If President Biden is serious about 
building back better, he should not be 
trying to destroy the domestic energy 
industry that will lead us to a better 
tomorrow. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania for his words specifically 
addressing the dismantling of energy 
independence. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, 
it is great to represent the great State 
of Arkansas. I want to say thank you 
to the HEAT Team and to Mr. JOYCE 
for holding this Special Order on the 
Democrats’ assault on American en-
ergy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H5457 
September 27, 2021 
As gas prices have recently reached 
the highest level since 2014, Americans 
are seeing the effects of the decisions 
that were made on day one by Presi-
dent Biden. 
In the Natural Resources Committee, 
Democrats continue to attack safe and 
reliable energy production, spend mil-
lions to kill American energy jobs, im-
pose new taxes and fees on working 
families, and make our Nation more re-
liant than ever on foreign adversaries 
for critical minerals and energy re-
sources we could be producing more 
cleanly, cheaply, and effectively right 
here at home. 
One glaring example of that—and 
there are many—is in the Natural Re-
sources Committee when we marked up 
this atrocious, now $51⁄2 trillion, spend-
ing bill that the Democrats are trying 
to push through Congress. There is ac-
tually a line item there, a $350 million 
line item to close down a copper mine. 
Now, Madam Speaker, how can you 
talk about green energy when you 
want to close down copper mines in the 
United States? 
Now, this copper mine is in Arizona, 
and it was agreed to on a bipartisan 
bill by Senators Harry Reid and John 
McCain. The mine is being developed. 
As a matter of fact, the owner of the 
mine has spent $2 billion developing 
this mine. It is 7,000 feet below ground, 
but Democrats want to yank that lease 
out of their hands. They want to close 
it down. 
Now, what does that tell investors 
who want to invest in mining in Amer-
ica? 
It says: We are closed. We are not 
open for business. 
Madam Speaker, you can look at nu-
merous other examples. A cancelation 
of the Keystone XL pipeline imme-
diately eliminated 1,000 union jobs as 
well as 10,000 projected jobs associated 
with the project. 
The President’s ban on Federal oil 
and gas leasing has resulted in lost rev-
enues for energy producing States and 
led our National Security Advisor to 
beg OPEC Plus—which includes Russia, 
Iran, and Venezuela—to increase sup-
ply and bail us out. 
If this administration’s leasing bans 
become permanent, nearly 500,000 jobs 
could be lost by 2040. 
Additionally, in 2019, States received 
a total of $1.81 billion for mineral reve-
nues and used these funds to support 
public schools, environmental restora-
tion, coastal resiliency, and many of 
our important programs. 
This administration has disregarded 
the fact that energy development sup-
ports major environmental efforts at 
the Federal level, such as the Land and 
Water Conservation Fund which is spe-
cifically funded by offshore drilling 
revenues. 
To justify its actions, the adminis-
tration has argued that a major scale- 
up in renewables will replace lost jobs 
and generating capacity. That is non-
sense. Forcing a national switch to al-
ternative energy against market forces 
will result in massive unemployment, 
higher energy prices, and possibly roll-
ing blackouts from insufficient power. 
The Democrat’s plan simply will not 
work. It will not work for the econ-
omy, and it will not work for the envi-
ronment. 
Here is why it won’t work: The 
Democrat’s plan is all about electric 
vehicles. We are going to make electric 
vehicles. Well, Madam Speaker, if you 
look at global greenhouse gas emis-
sions, the U.S. accounts for 15 percent 
of it. Transportation is 29 percent. If 
you could eliminate every internal 
combustion engine, Madam Speaker, 
you would only affect global emissions 
by a little over 4 percent, and that is if 
you didn’t have to use fossil fuels and 
emit carbon to make the electricity to 
power these cars. 
We are talking about a minimal im-
pact on global carbon at a huge cost for 
American consumers. We don’t even 
have the grid that can handle all of 
these 
electric 
vehicles. 
There 
are 
many, many technical problems with 
it. 
China, the world’s greatest polluter, 
last year built 38 gigawatts of coal 
power plants. That is one large coal- 
fired plant every week. 
We have to ask ourselves: Why would 
China go to coal? 
That is simple. It is because coal is 
reliable, and coal is low cost. 
When we look at what our energy 
policies should be here in the United 
States and when we look at what will 
actually work for our economy and es-
pecially for the global environment, we 
should be asking ourselves: How do we 
make the most reliable, lowest cost, 
and 
the 
cleanest 
technology—tech-
nology that developing countries will 
adopt? 
Because they are not going to adopt 
expensive technology. They are going 
to continue building old technology. 
We have got to be the innovators if 
we truly want to affect the global envi-
ronment. 
Again, I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak on this important matter, and 
I appreciate the gentleman for hosting 
this Special Order. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I think the gentleman from 
Arkansas has made incredible points 
we all should be listening to. He high-
lighted the important role that coal 
continues to play in supplying power to 
our electric grid. In Congress we need 
to remain committed to addressing the 
needs of the American people and en-
sure that they have safe, reliable, and 
affordable energy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. LATURNER). 
Mr. LATURNER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of energy pro-
ducers across our country and espe-
cially in my home State of Kansas. 
Over the past 9 months the Biden ad-
ministration has put American energy 
producers on the back burner. Kansans 
are already paying over 40 percent 
more at the pump than they were last 
year, and yet my colleagues across the 
aisle want to ram through a reckless 
$3.5 trillion spending spree that would 
lead to the largest tax increase on 
working families and small businesses 
in decades. 
There is a laundry list of bad policy 
in this spending spree, including the 
Clean Electricity Performance Pro-
gram, a Federal takeover of our Na-
tion’s electricity. This $150 billion pro-
gram would dictate how we power our 
homes, businesses, and everyday lives. 
Democrats want to mandate energy 
providers 
to 
distribute 
a 
certain 
amount of renewable energy to their 
customers. Those who comply will get 
grants from the Department of Energy, 
while those falling short would have to 
pay fees to the Federal Government. 
This plan is absolutely ridiculous and 
will only make energy more expensive, 
undermine our grid reliability, and 
make our Nation even more dependent 
on Communist China. 
As these massive Democrat spending 
sprees continue to make their way 
through committees and eventually to 
the House floor, I will continue to fight 
for Kansas energy producers. 
Our focus needs to be encouraging do-
mestic energy production across the 
country, having a robust energy port-
folio, and ending our reliance on for-
eign energy. 
Democrats seem to think it is impos-
sible to have affordable, bountiful, and 
innovative energy while also having 
clean air and water. That is simply not 
true. Oil and gas produced here in the 
United States is among the cleanest 
and safest in the world. It is time to 
end the assault on our energy pro-
ducers and return to American energy 
independence. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Kansas for his comments. 
The energy needs and the resources 
available throughout our country are 
very significant, and as we move for-
ward it is essential that government 
bureaucrats are not choosing the win-
ners and the losers. The best energy 
producers should rise to the top. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the Commonwealth of 
Kentucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Pennsylvania for his 
leadership and leading tonight’s Spe-
cial Order. 
As a member of both the HEAT Team 
and a member of the House Financial 
Services Committee, I want to address 
another dimension of the Biden admin-
istration’s war on American energy. 
Specifically it is the Biden adminis-
tration’s weaponization of financial 
regulation to implement through the 
back door of unilateral executive ac-
tion what it cannot do through the 
democratic process and what it cannot 
do through the Congress and through 
the legislative process, because, frank-
ly, the Biden administration knows 
that the American people oppose their 
radical agenda that would decrease the

reliability and affordability of elec-
tricity, industrial power, and the man-
ner in which we conduct daily life. 
b 2045 
That is, specifically, that the Biden 
administration intends to use financial 
regulators to bully banks, investors, 
and other financial firms, to divert 
capital away from what they view as 
politically unfashionable energy pro-
ducers. 
This is coming in multiple different 
forms. The Secretary of the Treasury 
has set up a czar within the Depart-
ment of the Treasury to look at this 
from a holistic perspective to discrimi-
nate against American companies and 
American workers. 
In bank regulation, there is a concept 
called redlining, and it used to be that 
it was illegal for banks and other fi-
nancial firms to discriminate against 
the American people. Well, now the 
Biden administration is legalizing red-
lining. They are redlining against their 
own people because they are engaged in 
an industry, a great American industry 
that, for decades, has powered the 
American economy. Now they want to 
discriminate against those American 
heroes who have literally powered this 
country for decades. 
What form does this take? Number 
one, it is taking the form of bank regu-
lation, where the bank regulators are 
bullying credit providers and saying: 
You ought to rethink who you are lend-
ing money to because we don’t think 
you should be lending money because 
of the reputational risk. 
For example, ‘‘Bank A, you better 
stop loaning money to that Kentucky 
coal mining operator. We want to get 
rid of all those coal mining jobs in 
eastern Kentucky,’’ in my home State. 
So, instead of going after the coal 
mining operator directly, they are 
going to the bank and saying: Choke 
off that coal mining company. 
To heck with the fact that those 
mining jobs are important to put food 
on the table for those people in eastern 
Kentucky and in western Kentucky. 
They are weaponizing bank regulation. 
That is precisely why, Madam Speak-
er, I introduced a bill to fix this called 
the Fair Access to Banking Act. This 
would basically codify the Fair Access 
to Financial Services Rule that the Of-
fice of the Comptroller promulgated in 
the previous administration. It would 
basically provide a guidance to banks 
that they must provide access to cap-
ital and credit based on assessment of 
the borrower’s actual risk, rather than 
making broad-based decisions impact-
ing entire industries. 
This is guided by the fundamental 
principle of nondiscrimination and en-
sures that banks can’t pick winners 
and losers in the marketplace. 
That bill is pending in the Financial 
Services Committee, and we can’t get 
any kind of consideration by this ma-
jority because this majority doesn’t 
want fair access to banking. They are 
endorsing the Biden administration 
policy of discriminating against the 
American people. 
Then there is the issue of ESG in-
vesting and mandating ESG, so-called 
environmental and social governance. 
This is through the back door of securi-
ties regulations at the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, but this is not 
the mission of the SEC. 
The statutory mission of the SEC is 
to protect investors; to maintain fair, 
orderly, and efficient markets; and to 
facilitate capital formation. Its mis-
sion is not to reduce carbon emissions 
or solve climate change or try to 
change the weather. 
I acknowledge that there is some in-
vestor demand in the market for ESG 
funds. I also see some utility in stand-
ardization of ESG disclosures to elimi-
nate some of the inconsistencies in the 
way public companies are rated be-
cause, let’s face it, even if you are in-
terested in sustainable investing, you 
do not know what you are investing in 
because these ESG funds are frauds, in 
many cases. 
But more than 90 percent of all S&P 
500 companies already voluntarily pub-
lish ESG information on an annual 
basis, and this regulatory approach 
from the Gensler SEC would not pro-
vide new material information to in-
vestors. Instead, it would inundate in-
vestors with voluminous, confusing, 
and 
nonmaterial 
information 
that 
would hurt the very investors that 
Democrats claim they want to help or, 
in the words of the late Justice 
Thurgood Marshall, in TSC Industries 
v. Northway, bury the shareholders in 
an avalanche of trivial information, a 
result that is hardly conducive to in-
formed decisionmaking. We need to 
avoid burdening investors with an ava-
lanche of trivial information. 
The 
Gensler 
SEC 
would 
also 
weaponize disclosure requirements to 
name and shame politically incorrect 
companies; pick winners and losers in 
the 
marketplace; 
and 
discriminate 
against energy firms that produce jobs, 
affordable and reliable energy, and re-
turns to investors. 
The SEC proposal would also com-
promise investor returns by elevating 
nonpecuniary factors above and ahead 
of financial performance. Fees for ESG 
funds are 43 percent higher than non- 
ESG funds and many low-ranked ESG 
stocks. They outperform the market 
overall. 
We must not harm American savers 
by subordinating investor returns to 
promote nonpecuniary policy objec-
tives 
like 
social 
justice, 
diversity 
quotas, and lower carbon emissions. 
Finally, the Gensler SEC, the Biden 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 
would increase compliance costs for 
public companies, discourage private 
companies from going public, and en-
courage public companies to go pri-
vate, resulting in fewer investment 
choices for everyday investors. This is 
why the Gensler SEC is even proposing 
to hoist these requirements on private 
companies. The SEC, by wading into 
social and environmental policy de-
bates like climate change, through a 
top-down, government-directed, one- 
size-fits-all mandatory ESG disclosure 
regulation, untethered to the long-
standing investor-driven materiality 
standard, will politicize the agency and 
reduce its credibility by hurting inves-
tors, elevating nonpecuniary factors 
above financial returns. 
Here is the bottom line. Not only is 
the Biden administration waging a 
frontal assault on heroic American en-
ergy companies that provide the Amer-
ican people with affordable, reliable en-
ergy, particularly low-income and blue 
collar families who can’t afford the 
skyrocketing costs of Biden’s energy 
bill, but in addition to that, this back-
door approach to financial regulation, 
discriminating against Americans in 
these industries, will compromise in-
vestor 
returns, 
elevating 
and 
prioritizing the woke environmental 
priorities of the select coastal elites 
over middle-income Americans in the 
energy sector who provide affordable 
energy for the American people, com-
promising Main Street investment re-
turns. 
Those moms and dads who are trying 
to put their kids through college, those 
folks who are trying to save in their 
401(k)’s and their IRAs just to have a 
secure retirement, those middle-class 
Americans are going to be the ones 
who suffer because of the politicization 
and the weaponization of securities 
regulation. 
This is exactly why we must oppose 
this dangerous agenda that will com-
promise American energy dominance, 
American energy independence, and in-
vestor returns. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
from Pennsylvania for his leadership 
on this issue. I thank the HEAT Team 
for bringing some light to this. I want-
ed to provide a little bit of a different 
dimension to this important debate, 
and that is how the Biden administra-
tion is weaponizing financial regula-
tion. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, could you please clarify how 
much time I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 15 minutes remaining. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the whip of 
the minority team. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Pennsylvania, 
Dr. JOYCE, for yielding and for leading 
this effort to defend American energy. 
Madam Speaker, you might wonder: 
Why are we on the House floor defend-
ing American energy? Who could pos-
sibly, in the United States Congress, be 
opposed to American energy? 
Unfortunately, as we have seen this 
year, from President Biden to Speaker 
PELOSI to this whole Democrat major-
ity, they have had an all-out assault on 
American energy. 
It started day one when President 
Biden took the oath of office. That day,

he drove down Pennsylvania Avenue 
and started signing executive orders to 
destroy America’s energy independ-
ence. 
It started with the Keystone pipeline. 
It was a great relationship between the 
United States and our great friend, 
Canada, our neighbor from the north, a 
pipeline to bring energy to America 
where it could be refined in a really 
good, environmentally protective way 
in the United States of America. But 
President Biden said no. 
You would think he said no because 
he is just against pipelines in general, 
except just weeks later, President 
Biden green-lighted a pipeline in Rus-
sia, from Russia to Germany. So, Presi-
dent Biden was against American en-
ergy jobs and American pipelines, but 
he was okay with helping Russia, giv-
ing a gift to Russia. 
He kept going on and on. He put a 
moratorium on drilling in the United 
States, but then, just weeks ago, he 
tried to ban not only American energy 
but then he goes and begs OPEC and 
Russia to produce more oil. You can’t 
make this stuff up. 
If American energy is so bad, why are 
you begging OPEC and Russia to 
produce fossil fuels? They are either 
good or they are bad. 
The question here, Madam Speaker, 
is: Where should energy be made? 
If you look at this whole global 
warming, Green New Deal push by the 
President to increase taxes on Ameri-
cans, you wonder why Americans are 
paying 40 percent more for gasoline at 
the pump. It is because of President 
Biden’s assault on American energy. 
But he has given OPEC a free pass. In 
fact, he is giving OPEC more leverage 
by cutting off our supply and letting 
them increase their supply. 
Now, you might think Russia or 
Saudi Arabia or China came up with 
this crazy strategy. No, it was Presi-
dent Biden and Speaker PELOSI and a 
Democrat Congress that came up with 
this, and you are seeing it in their tax 
proposal, this crazy $5.5 trillion mas-
sive tax-and-spend proposal we are 
going to see come into play this week 
on the House floor—more assaults on 
American energy. 
Who pays? I will tell you who pays: 
the 
American 
consumer, 
families, 
hardworking families. In fact, the peo-
ple hit the hardest are the lowest in-
come people. 
Remember 
when 
President 
Biden 
promised 
if 
you 
make 
less 
than 
$400,000, you won’t pay a dime in new 
taxes? Sounded great, except he is al-
ready pledging to break that promise 
by increasing taxes on, among many 
other things, natural gas. 
That is right. If you use natural gas 
to heat your home or cool your home, 
you are going to pay more, double dig-
its more, every single month under 
President Biden’s plan. That is right. 
He broke that promise. 
Then if you look at all of his other 
assaults on American energy, if it was 
all about carbon emissions and saving 
the planet, well, guess what? Those for-
eign countries that we were talking 
about, whether it is Russia or OPEC 
nations, they emit more carbon to 
make the same oil. To produce oil 
emits carbon. 
In America, we actually do it better 
than anywhere else in the world. If you 
want to reduce carbon emissions, make 
more of it here in America, not less. 
Why would you want to give a gift to 
countries that don’t have the same 
standards we have? 
Too often, you see liberals on the 
other side wanting to bash America 
every single day. You know, hit Amer-
ica, attack America. 
Enough is enough. People are fig-
uring this out. They are paying more 
at the pump. They are paying more at 
the grocery store. They are paying 
more for everything because of these 
radical assaults on American energy 
and American entrepreneurialism. 
Free market capitalism is under as-
sault by Big Government socialism. 
That is what this fight is about. 
We are going to continue to stand up 
for American energy and to get the 
facts out. If you are going to make 
stuff anywhere in the world, if you 
want to produce steel, make it in 
America, because if you make it in 
China or India or some other country, 
they emit five times more carbon. 
Yet, what President Biden is doing in 
his policies is attacking that very 
American energy that works to create 
great jobs here at home to rebuild our 
middle class, to help those hard-
working families who are sick and 
tired of paying more, and stop giving 
gifts to foreign countries like China. 
I thank my colleague from Pennsyl-
vania for his leadership. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the whip for his con-
cise discussion about the assault on 
American energy and how that affects 
the 
working 
class 
communities 
throughout the United States. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my col-
league 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my esteemed colleague for his 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, this is my genera-
tion’s long-form death certificate. You 
endorsed it. You own it, and you will 
pass it. But I will be the one to pay for 
it. 
My generation, and if America still 
stands, my grandchildren, will pay for 
this Trojan horse of a socialist pro-
posal, $3.5 trillion in unhinged, uncon-
scionable, irredeemable spending. 
It is the final nail in the coffin of the 
American Dream. Karl Marx would 
even call this bill radical. 
Look at this. This is a pallet of $100 
million and, for scale, beside that is 
me. And behind all of that is what the 
Democrats propose to spend. 
You have stolen my generation’s 
checkbook, and, Madam Speaker, we 
want it back. No American who votes 
for this trash should ever see the inside 
of a legislative chamber ever again. 
They should never take another oath of 
office for Congress, for statehouse. 
Hell, they shouldn’t even be able to get 
on the mosquito control board because 
they have endorsed the demise of the 
country they swore to protect. 
b 2100 
This is what crushing, overwhelming, 
unrecoverable debt looks like. And we 
haven’t even talked about the sub-
stance. This proposal is legislative 
malfeasance on the lifeblood of our 
country: 
energy 
independence, 
and 
more importantly, energy dominance. 
You show me a nation’s energy poli-
cies, and I will show you the future of 
that nation. Under President Trump, 
our energy independence carved out 
our standing in the world. We were the 
captains of our destiny, not Middle 
East kingdoms. We augmented our na-
tional security through America First 
energy independence, not foreign reli-
ance. America was leading the world. 
When Joe Biden took office, our soar-
ing, 
thriving 
energy 
independence 
came crashing down. 
Failed policies, fatal spending: that 
is your legacy, Madam Speaker. You 
have put before us a death wish for 
America. 
You stand guilty of financial treason, 
Madam Speaker. But the sentence will 
be served out by my generation. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend from Pennsyl-
vania, Dr. JOYCE, for holding this Spe-
cial Order tonight. 
I find myself increasingly concerned 
with the future of our country, espe-
cially now under the Biden administra-
tion, where it has been one self-in-
flicted crisis after another. 
How have we addressed these situa-
tions? Well, we have seen unprece-
dented intrusions into our daily lives 
by the Federal Government; trillions 
added to our national debt; and the 
birth of new, completely avoidable 
threats to our national security. 
Even this administration’s approach 
to energy unnecessarily threatens the 
safety and security of all Americans. 
On day one of his administration, 
President Biden shut down the Key-
stone pipeline, costing thousands of 
jobs, and then turns around to support 
Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Big 
question mark. 
Make no mistake. This is an America 
last policy. In fact, it could be America 
never. 
We need an energy policy that gives 
America greater energy independence, 
not one where we are forced to rely on 
unstable foreign markets. 
We have the resources and tech-
nology at home, right here, to give us 
that independence, yet Democrat lead-
ership continues to ignore it in favor of 
the Green New Deal. 
Don’t get me wrong. I support energy 
policies that promote resiliency and

sustainability, but I wholeheartedly 
disagree with the notion that we need 
to punish the American energy indus-
try in order to achieve a healthy envi-
ronment. 
I urge this administration and my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
to focus on real investments in Amer-
ican energy, instead of policies that 
make us more dependent on foreign en-
ergy sources while destroying jobs, 
alienating American industry, and de-
pressing the hardworking people who 
continue to strive to keep our coun-
try—that is our country, the United 
States of America—the premier exam-
ple of integrity, innovation, and initia-
tive that leads the world, especially in 
safe, affordable energy. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Michigan for his concise and inspiring 
words. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague from 
Pennsylvania for hosting this Special 
Order. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of every American family. Cold, 
dark, and hungry is where those fami-
lies will be if we continue on this path: 
cold, dark, and hungry. 
Just two years ago, the United States 
became energy independent, the num-
ber one producer of oil and gas in the 
entire world, thanks to the previous 
administration’s leadership on deregu-
lating industry that made greater 
gains in reducing harmful emissions 
than any other administration in the 
history of this country. 
Now, we risk losing our competitive 
edge on the world stage with needless 
regulations and more taxes in the 
budget reconciliation bill that will 
only hurt small and independent pro-
ducers and will hurt every working- 
class family in this country. 
Let’s look across the Atlantic to our 
neighbors in Europe right this second 
who are currently suffering through a 
cataclysmic energy crisis. Their short-
age of natural gas and fuel is causing 
multiple governments across Europe to 
shut down factories and to warn their 
citizens 
to 
prepare 
for 
consistent 
blackouts. Cold, dark, and hungry. 
Meanwhile, the fuel lines are growing 
scarily close to what we saw in the 
1970s. This world of shortages, black-
outs, and fuel lines may be in Europe 
today, but it is going to be a reality 
right here in the United States if this 
administration continues to push reck-
less and destructive energy policies. 
The fate of this is in the hands of this 
body right here, of Democrats who say 
that they support oil and gas. But we 
know that the vote that is going to 
happen 
this 
week 
will 
determine 
whether or not they really support it. 
As technology advances and the 
world population continues to grow, we 
are only going to need more and more 
energy to power this world. 
The truth is that renewables simply 
cannot provide affordable and reliable 
energy. In my home State, in my dis-
trict, we produce more wind energy 
than the entire State of California. We 
know a little bit about renewables. 
A strong energy sector is nonnego-
tiable. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues con-
tinue to push policies that have de-
stroyed American energy independence 
and will devastate over 10 million jobs 
right here in the United States. 
American private energy industry in-
genuity can compete toe-to-toe with 
anyone in the world to deliver a safe 
and responsible energy source, but we 
cannot shackle our production with ill- 
advised policies and regulations. 
The Permian Basin, where I rep-
resent, is the reason that every Amer-
ican can enjoy affordable, reliable en-
ergy in so many other places across 
this United States. 
Energy security is national security, 
and nothing can be more important. 
Anyone voting in favor of reconcili-
ation is voting against American en-
ergy and is voting against the inde-
pendence that keeps our national secu-
rity so strong. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
energy industry and to embrace an all- 
of-the-above energy approach, which is 
so dependent on American oil and gas. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas for his remarks. 
I want to thank all of the members of 
the House Energy Action Team for 
their work tonight and their commit-
ment to the American people. 
We have heard examples of how 
President Biden’s disastrous policies 
are harmful to energy producers and to 
the consumers. We have seen examples 
of how these policies create over-
burdensome 
regulations 
that 
harm 
small businesses and stifle innovation. 
I am proud to be working with my 
HEAT colleagues to push back against 
these disastrous policies. 
Right now, the United States must 
embrace an all-of-the-above energy so-
lution that will combine the needs of 
the consumers with the strengths of 
our producers. 
What does that mean? It means em-
bracing baseload power creators, in-
cluding coal and natural gas produced 
from Marcellus Shale. These are crit-
ical components of Pennsylvania’s en-
ergy industry. 
On the first day in office, President 
Biden signed an executive order that 
suspended work on the needed Key-
stone XL pipeline. 
In Pennsylvania, the natural gas and 
oil industry supports over 300,000 jobs, 
provides over $20 billion in wages, and 
contributes nearly $44.5 billion to our 
economy. 
Between 2018 and 2019 alone, natural 
gas brought in over $450 million in rev-
enue in our Commonwealth. 
We have learned a lot tonight. We 
have learned the strong energy sector 
cannot and should not be negotiable. 
We recognize that energy security is 
clearly national security. 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for al-
lowing 
my 
colleagues 
and 
me 
to 
present this important information to-
night to the United States Congress. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the re-
mainder of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. ROUZER. Madam Speaker, where there 
is an abundance of energy, there is prosperity. 
Energy made in America creates jobs, lowers 
energy costs for American families and small 
businesses, and enhances our national secu-
rity. 
Unfortunately, the Biden administration is 
working overtime to undo all the progress 
made during the previous administration to-
wards 
energy 
independence. 
They 
have 
banned new oil and gas leases on public 
lands and cancelled the Keystone XL Pipe-
line—killing thousands of American jobs and 
increasing our Nation’s dependence on foreign 
countries. 
Now, the liberals in Congress hope to pass 
their $4.3 trillion tax and spend spree that in-
cludes their radical new tax on natural gas. 
Natural gas, by the way, is the primary reason 
why carbon emissions today are substantially 
lower. 
This extreme partisan provision will not only 
decimate American energy, but it will kill thou-
sands of good-paying jobs, burden families 
with higher utility costs, and make the United 
States more dependent on our adversaries, 
whose economies produce dramatically more 
carbon than the United States. 
While President Biden promised not to raise 
taxes on middle-class American families, this 
assault on fossil fuels breaks his promise in 
the form of higher energy costs on families 
who are already feeling the impacts of sky- 
rocketing inflation. 
The Colonial Pipeline cybersecurity attack 
that took place earlier this year underscores 
the need to invest in a more robust and se-
cure energy future. With the pipeline trans-
porting nearly half of the East Coast’s fuel 
supply, gasoline shortages threatened millions 
of Americans. This caused long lines at the 
pump and, in many cases, such as in North 
Carolina, no fuel at the vast majority of gas 
pumps. This is the perfect example of why we 
need more opportunities for reliable energy— 
not less. 
As I stated at the outset: where there is an 
abundance of energy, there is prosperity. And 
instead of attacking American energy pro-
ducers, this administration and Congress 
should be working to ensure our energy sup-
ply is more resilient—not more vulnerable.

The Speaker, on Saturday, Sep-

the following titles:

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who makes the crooked 
places straight, continue to guide our 
lawmakers as they seek to walk with 
wisdom and integrity. May they em-
brace Your wisdom, which is pure, 
gentle, considerate, merciful, produc-
tive, peaceful, and sincere. 
Lord, lead them on a path of integ-
rity that strives to keep a clear con-
science before You and humanity. In-
spired by Your unconditional love, em-
power our Senators to achieve a faith-
fulness that will cause people to glorify 
Your Name. Provide our legislators 
with the courage to turn from evil as 
You do for them more than they can 
ask or imagine. 
We pray in Your righteous Name. 
Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
after today, there will be no doubt 
which party is working to solve the 
problems in our country and which 
party is accelerating us toward an un-
necessary, avoidable disaster. 
Let me say that again without inter-
ruption. 
Madam President, after today, there 
will be no doubt—no doubt—about 
which party in this Chamber is work-
ing to solve the problems that face our 
country and which party is accel-
erating us toward unnecessary, avoid-
able disaster. 
At the end of last week, I filed clo-
ture on proceeding to the continuing 
resolution sent to us by the House of 
Representatives, which, among other 
things, would prevent a government 
shutdown and suspend the debt limit so 
we can pay for our debts incurred dur-
ing the previous administration. 
In a few hours, we will vote on clo-
ture on a motion to proceed to this 
bill. The Democrats will do the respon-
sible thing, the right thing, and the 
thing that has been done for decades by 
both parties and vote yes. 
Now, if Republicans follow through 
with their plans to vote no, they will 
be on record deliberately sabotaging 
our country’s ability to pay the bills 
and likely causing the first ever de-
fault in American history. The con-
sequences of a default would be, in the 
words 
of 
Secretary 
Yellen, 
‘‘cata-
strophic.’’ 
The best case scenario is—the best 
case under this awful situation is—that 
our country would fall into another re-
cession, potentially erasing all the 
progress we have made to pull our-
selves out of the COVID crisis. That is 
if we are lucky. Otherwise, one anal-
ysis warned that default could hurt 
Americans for generations—for genera-
tions. Interest costs would be higher 
and not go down very quickly, and that 
has huge effects on so many different 
people, and that is only one of the ef-
fects of default. 
So I want my Republican colleagues 
to think carefully about the practical 
consequences of what they are doing. A 
default means, quite simply, the gov-
ernment cannot pay its bills. It means 
that suddenly the government is pre-
sented with unimaginable options. Do 
they tell seniors they won’t get their 
Social Security checks, or veterans 
that they won’t see their benefits, or 
tell our military that they won’t be 
getting paid? 
And the consequences on Main Street 
would be equally severe. A default 
would very likely send markets crash-
ing and interest rates skyrocketing, 
making it harder for small businesses 
to make ends meet, for homeowners 
and renters to pay the bills, and for 
consumers to keep our economy going. 
All of the consequences—or so many 
of the consequences—can be boiled 
down into three frightening numbers: 6 
million, 9, $15 trillion—6 million jobs 
lost, 9 percent unemployment, $15 tril-
lion in squandered household wealth. 
Let me say that again. Those are dev-
astating numbers on so many house-
holds throughout America, just about 
every household. That is 6 million jobs 
lost, 9 percent unemployment, $15 tril-
lion in squandered household wealth. 
Yes, that is what we are potentially 
looking at if Republicans get their ir-
responsible and reckless way. None of 
this needs to happen—none of it. The 
only reason we are here and the only 
reason this is even a possibility is be-
cause Republicans are making this a 
possibility by preventing the govern-
ment from paying its bills. It is an un-
hinged position to take, one that not 
long ago only the most radical ele-
ments of the Republican Party would 
have embraced.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6684 
September 27, 2021 
There is no scenario on God’s green 
Earth where it should be worth risking 
millions of jobs, trillions in household 
wealth, 
people’s 
Social 
Security 
checks, veterans’ benefits, and another 
recession, just to score a short-term, 
meaningless political point. That is 
what Republicans seem fixated on 
doing. 
Now, there is a very simple step we 
can take today to guarantee the gov-
ernment won’t default and won’t shut 
down. Both sides can come together to 
vote yes on today’s vote and vote to 
pass the continuing resolution. Just as 
Democrats worked in a bipartisan fash-
ion under the Trump administration, 
Republicans must now step up to the 
plate. To do otherwise is the height of 
recklessness and irresponsibility. 
Republicans say they don’t want to 
see a government shutdown. They say 
they don’t want to see our government 
default on our debt. Then, they should 
vote yes. It is plain and simple. It is 
very clear. There is no obfuscation 
here—crystal clear. Voting yes means 
avoiding default and avoiding a govern-
ment shutdown. Voting no says: Let’s 
risk it. Let’s risk it. 
By choosing to block today’s resolu-
tion, Republicans are intentionally 
making default more likely. By block-
ing an extension of the debt limit, Re-
publicans will solidify themselves for a 
long time as the party of default. 
I cannot emphasize that this isn’t 
just another political game. We are 
facing a parade of horribles that will 
hurt every single American in this 
country. And it is important to remem-
ber that today’s vote will also advance 
a number of priorities besides just 
funding the government and avoiding 
default, as important as those are. It 
would 
provide 
desperately 
needed 
emergency funding for millions of peo-
ple affected by natural disasters from 
this 
summer, 
including 
hurricanes, 
wildfires, and flooding across Ten-
nessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. It will 
provide billions to help resettle Afghan 
refugees who risked their lives helping 
our troops abroad. Both sides claim 
they support these priorities. So the 
easy answer is to vote yes later today. 
Being elected to office means some-
times you have to do things to rise 
above partisan politics. It means we 
have an obligation to work together 
when our country faces an acute crisis. 
Tearing the barn down is easy. Build-
ing it up, preserving it, and keeping it 
standing year after year takes hard 
work and cooperation. And, at the end 
of the day, the only thing that matters 
in this Chamber is how its Members 
vote. 
Rest assured, Democrats will vote 
today to do the right thing. The Amer-
ican people will be watching whether 
or 
not 
our 
Republican 
colleagues 
choose to vote in favor of preserving 
our full faith and credit or vote in 
favor of an unprecedented default. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
VACCINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I am glad to share that, a few minutes 
ago, I received a booster vaccination 
for COVID–19. All throughout the pan-
demic, I have followed the best advice 
from experts and especially from my 
own healthcare providers. It was an 
easy decision to receive a booster. 
I am a survivor of childhood polio 
from before vaccines—before vaccines 
eradicated that disease here in our 
country and around the world now. So 
I have been a lifelong champion of vac-
cinations. 
Mountains of evidence tell us these 
shots are safe, effective, and dramati-
cally shrink the odds of severe disease 
or death from COVID. Like I have been 
saying for months, these safe and effec-
tive vaccines are the way to defend 
ourselves and our families from this 
terrible virus. They are also how we 
stay on offense against COVID as a 
country. All Americans should speak 
with their doctors and get vaccinated. 
ECONOMY 
Madam President, now, on a com-
pletely different matter, it is not un-
usual for a President to have a rough 
spell. Every administration faces a 
stretch of time where nothing seems to 
go their way. But what we are wit-
nessing today is entirely different. 
President Biden has not been dealt a 
bad hand by forces outside his control. 
This 
White 
House 
is 
not 
sailing 
through some unavoidable patch of 
choppy water. No, the Democrats have 
steered our country straight into a 
storm of serious crises all of their own 
making. 
On issue after issue, Americans are 
hurting 
because 
of 
specific 
policy 
choices that Democrats have made 
over the objections of people who actu-
ally knew better. Democrats did not in-
herit most of the painful inflation that 
is hammering working families. Their 
decisions have fueled it. Even liberal 
economists warned the President that 
runaway liberal spending could send 
costs soaring—soaring—for the middle 
class. Now working Americans are pay-
ing dearly at the grocery store, at the 
gas station, and practically everywhere 
that matters to families. 
And 
what 
are 
Democrats 
doing 
today? Putting together yet another 
reckless taxing-and-spending spree be-
hind closed doors that would make in-
flation even worse. 
Now, President Biden did not inherit 
humiliation in Afghanistan either; he 
deliberately chose that as well. The 
Biden administration’s own experts 
warned the White House that a reck-
less withdrawal would embolden terror-
ists and harm our ability to gather in-
telligence that keeps us safe. But the 
President clung to his made-up dead-
line, handed huge momentum to the 
Taliban and their terrorist friends, and 
broke his explicit promise to leave no 
American behind who wanted out. As 
one former Democratic Member of Con-
gress said last week, ‘‘The way the ad-
ministration executed that withdrawal 
last week has been an utter and abject 
disaster.’’ 
Democrats did not inherit this border 
crisis either. This security nightmare 
and human tragedy is yet another di-
rect result of their own policies. Presi-
dent Biden and his allies spent 2 years 
campaigning on the concept of Big 
Government giveaways to people here 
illegally. Then they took office and 
began dismantling enforcement on the 
border. So what do they expect? Wave 
after wave of vulnerable people have 
been lured into hellish conditions by 
the mirage the Democrats have set 
up—cruelty masquerading as compas-
sion. Untold thousands of people have 
simply been released into our country 
with what amounts to a polite invita-
tion to show up—show up—for a hear-
ing. Even before the Biden surge, only 
about 
half 
of 
individuals 
actually 
showed up. 
One self-created crisis after another 
from our unified Democratic Party 
government. The latest additions are 
their confusion about how to fund the 
government and raise the debt ceiling. 
For more than 2 months now, Senate 
Republicans 
have 
been 
completely 
clear about how this process will play 
out, so let me make it abundantly 
clear one more time. 
We will support a clean continuing 
resolution that will prevent a govern-
ment shutdown, get disaster relief to 
Louisiana, help properly vetted Afghan 
refugees who put themselves on the 
line for America, and support the Iron 
Dome assistance for our ally Israel. We 
will not provide Republican votes for 
raising the debt limit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6685 
September 27, 2021 
As we speak, Democrats are behind 
closed doors, assembling a multitril-
lion-dollar reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree. There is no chance Repub-
licans will help lift Democrats’ credit 
limit so they can immediately steam-
roll through a socialist binge that will 
hurt families and help China. 
There is no particular tradition that 
the minority will always vote for debt 
limit hikes during united government. 
When Republicans had unified control 
in the early 2000s, then-Senators Biden 
and Schumer voted no on a debt limit 
increase and made the party in power 
handle it on their own—exactly the sit-
uation we are in now. The roles were 
reversed. Bipartisanship is not a light 
switch—a light switch—that Demo-
crats get to flip on when they need to 
borrow money and switch off when 
they want to spend money. 
The debt suspension that expired in 
August covered all the debt that had 
been accumulated to that point. This is 
an argument about the future. Demo-
crats want to use this temporary pan-
demic as a Trojan horse for permanent 
socialism. They have all but said so. 
And that is what millions and millions 
of Americans elected 50 Republican 
Senators to fight against. 
For 10 weeks now—10 weeks—Demo-
crats have known what kind of govern-
ment funding legislation could pass the 
Senate and what kind would fail. Re-
publicans are not rooting for a shut-
down or debt limit breach. We have 
given the united Democratic govern-
ment total clarity about how each can 
be avoided. Republicans have explained 
exactly what kind of continuing resolu-
tion can pass the Senate with our sup-
port. 
Late last week, the House Demo-
cratic 
leader 
publicly 
said 
House 
Democrats are ready to swallow what-
ever CR the Senate can send them. So 
the House is ready. Senate Republicans 
are ready. We could have a bipartisan 
vote to fund the government today if 
not for the odd tactics of the Senate 
Democratic leader. 
Before we vote this afternoon, I will 
ask consent to strike the partisan CR 
that is dead on arrival and instead 
have the Senate vote on a clean con-
tinuing resolution that could pass this 
Chamber easily. We will see if Wash-
ington Democrats actually want to 
govern or whether they want to add the 
prospect of a government shutdown to 
the list of inflation, Afghanistan, the 
border, and all the other national cri-
ses that are the direct results of their 
own decisions. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
JANUARY 6 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, you 
remember the day—you will never for-
get it—January 6. Here we were in this 
Chamber in the process of certifying 
the electoral college votes. It was a 
pretty solemn occasion because this 
happens once every 4 years. We have 
documents coming from the States 
telling us what happened in the elec-
tion of last year for President of the 
United States. It is our job to make 
sure that those reports are documented 
and that the ordinary process of the de-
mocracy proceeds. 
This January 6 was not an ordinary 
day by any means. Before we set about 
our task here in the Senate and the 
House, the President of the United 
States, Donald Trump, held a rally, 
claiming that, in fact, he didn’t lose 
the election, that he won the last elec-
tion, and he alleged all sorts of fraud 
and misconduct on the part of Demo-
crats and others that resulted in this 
faulty report that somehow or another 
he had lost the election. 
Well, his crowd got so fired up that 
they decided to march on the Capitol 
as we were counting the electoral col-
lege ballots. I can remember it well. 
Vice President Pence was sitting where 
you were, I say to the Presiding Offi-
cer. We were going through the regular 
process, and it was a little after 2 
o’clock in the afternoon. All of a sud-
den, that door opened over there, and 
people came in in suits I had never seen 
before and literally yanked the Vice 
President off the podium and pulled 
him out that door. 
It was only a minute or two later 
that a member of the Capitol Police— 
the men and women who guard us and 
guard the visitors to this Capitol—a 
member of the Capitol Police stood 
where you are sitting and reported to 
us that there was a demonstration out-
side and that we should remain in this 
Chamber, in this Senate Chamber, be-
cause they were going to make it a safe 
room in the Capitol. At that time, I no-
ticed staff people were being brought in 
and lined up along the back of the 
room itself. 
It wasn’t 10 minutes later until the 
same member of the Capitol Police 
stood up and said: Change in plans; ev-
erybody leave as quickly as possible. 
And we all did, filing out toward the 
back of the room, every Member of the 
Senate. Luckily, the Parliamentarian 
or some other office decided to grab 
the boxes with the electoral college 
votes in them to preserve this impor-
tant piece of history from possible mob 
action. 
As we were filing out of the Capitol, 
I couldn’t help but look out the window 
and see the mobs coming on the Cap-
itol, converging on the Capitol, car-
rying Trump signs. We went to a safe 
location and waited it out and later 
that evening resumed our activities on 
the floor of the Senate, counted the 
votes, and made it official, with the 
Vice President present. 
It was an important part of history. 
You would think that would be enough 
of an embarrassment to President Don-
ald Trump that he would drop his 
claims that the election was stolen. He 
has done just the opposite. He has in-
tensified these false, malicious claims 
that somehow or another the vote was 
rigged or stolen, whatever his term 
might be—a fraud on the public—de-
spite clear evidence to the contrary. 
He pointed to a number of States 
that he said proved his point, where he 
just 
could 
not 
have 
lost—Donald 
Trump could not have lost these 
States—so clearly, he argued, some-
thing happened there that was criminal 
or wrong, and an investigation would 
show it. 
Well, one of those States was Ari-
zona. Joe Biden carried Arizona by 
roughly 10,500 votes. Forty-five thou-
sand Biden votes came from Maricopa 
County, so it was obviously crucial to 
his win. So the Republicans in Arizona 
decided they were going to zero in on 
Maricopa County and prove once and 
for all that Donald Trump didn’t lose 
that county by 45,000 votes. Well, they 
went to great lengths to do it. 
First, they gathered all their right-
wing groups and Trump’s defenders and 
raised $5.7 million in donations. Then 
they hired a group with the unlikely 
name—I am looking for it here; some-
thing to do with ninjas. I am sure it 
will pop up. Oh, Cyber Ninjas. This 
group has no experience analyzing an 
election. Yet they turned over all the 
ballots from Maricopa County to them 
to recount. 
Well, they pursued many bizarre 
theories, one of which I think was pro-
mulgated by the ever-reliable Rudy 
Giuliani that somehow or another 
there were bamboo fibers found in 
these election ballots, and those were 
an indication of wrongdoing and can 
connect the conspiracy maybe even to 
international sources. 
The Cyber Ninjas rolled up their 
sleeves, pulled in the boxes of ballots, 
and started their count. They were de-
termined to prove, once and for all, 
that the result that was announced 
that Biden carried the county by 45,000 
votes was wrong. And they proved it. 
Through all their hard work and all the 
money that was spent, it turns out the 
draft report from the company, Cyber 
Ninjas, found that there were 99 addi-
tional votes for Joe Biden, rather than 
the amount presented by the 261 fewer 
votes for Donald Trump in Maricopa 
County, just the opposite of what they 
had predicted. 
Well, you would think that President 
Trump would at least be quiet or 
maybe even acknowledge that he was 
wrong. Come on, you remember him. 
Here is what he said in a statement 
after the review was announced. He 
said the review ‘‘has uncovered signifi-
cant 
and 
undeniable 
evidence 
of 
FRAUD! Until we know how and why 
this happened, our Elections will never 
be secure.’’ 
He just won’t quit. And the problem, 
of course, is that so many Americans 
are buying it, primarily Republicans, 
increasing their numbers, believing his 
Big Lie about the election being stolen

from him. God forbid this man could 
lose an election. Who would ever dream 
of that? He can’t think of the possi-
bility. And they are joining him in the 
chorus, despite hard evidence that 
proves time and time and time again 
that he lost. 
It was a spirited election—Joe Biden 
and Donald Trump—and when it was 
all over, the American people made 
their choice. They accepted the reality 
of change. Now it is time for Donald 
Trump and his followers to do the 
same. 
I don’t know if the cyber ninja tur-
tles, or whoever they are, are going to 
go at it again in some other State, pick 
another State to do some investiga-
tion. More power to them. They are 
building up the majority for Joe 
Biden—just the opposite of what was 
predicted. 
DEBT CEILING 
Madam President, I would like to 
speak on another topic, if I might. 
We are going to have a vote later this 
afternoon, and it is not an ordinary 
vote in the U.S. Senate. We are voting 
on what is called the debt ceiling. 
The debt ceiling is the acknowledge-
ment of the government’s debt. It 
looks backward, and it says: Over a pe-
riod of time since we last expanded the 
size of the debt, we have incurred more 
debt, and, therefore, we have to ac-
knowledge the new debt ceiling in 
order to establish that the United 
States is going to pay that debt— 
which, of course, we want a reputation 
for paying just bills. And, in this situa-
tion, these were bills for debts incurred 
during the Trump administration. 
It should be a rather routine thing. 
In fact, one might make the argument 
that the Senate and the House should 
not even be involved in this acknowl-
edgement; it is simple accounting and 
should be announced to the American 
people. But for the time being, it is 
subject to a vote in the House and the 
Senate, and that is where the problems 
arise. 
Senator MCCONNELL, the Republican 
leader from Kentucky, is hoping that 
the American public will not clearly 
understand the gravity and the impor-
tance of this vote. He has announced 
that he is going to boycott this vote 
and not a single Republican will vote 
to acknowledge the true debt of the 
United States of America. 
I don’t know if he will be able to keep 
his word and whether every Republican 
Senator will march blindly behind him. 
They did once before, under the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, when Joe Biden pro-
posed that we do the things necessary 
to bring this pandemic to an end and 
get America back on its feet. Not a sin-
gle Republican would vote for it. 
We promised cash payment of $1,400 
for every family in America. It was in 
the American Rescue Plan. The Repub-
licans all voted against it. We passed 
the money, billions of dollars, so that 
we 
could 
actually 
administer 
the 
COVID vaccine across America. We had 
discovered the vaccines, but, of course, 
there is a huge infrastructure needed 
to make sure that they are safely ad-
ministered to the American people. 
That was in the American Rescue Plan, 
and all the Republicans voted against 
it. 
There was also a provision in there to 
deal with helping businesses reopen 
their doors. Saturday night in Chicago, 
I spoke to a restauranteur who told me 
about problems he had faced and the 
debts he incurred to get back on his 
feet. The American Rescue Plan helped 
Americans. 
And 
every 
Republican 
voted against it. Not a single Repub-
lican Member in the House or the Sen-
ate would support it. 
We are getting the same threats that 
the Republicans will walk out of the 
room. Resolving the debt ceiling is nec-
essary to pay for decisions made. This 
is debt incurred during the Trump ad-
ministration. And lest you think that 
this 
fiscally 
conservative 
Donald 
Trump was a good Republican when it 
came to debt, think again. The great-
est increase in America’s national debt 
in any 4-year period in our history, a 
36-percent increase. 
Let me repeat. Raising the debt ceil-
ing has nothing to do with future 
spending. 
We 
are 
paying 
Donald 
Trump’s bills. We are acknowledging 
what was done by the House and Sen-
ate, Republicans and Democrats—what 
was spent and now has to be repaid. 
This is about paying what we already 
owe, and it is also about averting an 
economic catastrophe. 
As a candidate, Donald Trump used 
to brag that he was ‘‘king of debt.’’ 
How about that. ‘‘King of debt’’ is what 
he says. Well, he proved it. His reckless 
spending as President, with America’s 
credit card, added nearly $8 trillion to 
our national debt—$8 trillion. This is a 
third of the entire debt. It was incurred 
during the Trump administration. 
And now the Republicans, his party, 
refuse to acknowledge that debt and 
the fact that we have to pay it back. 
He racked up all that debt in 4 years. 
Two trillion of that $8 trillion in 
Trump debt, incidentally, was spent on 
tax cuts for the richest people in Amer-
ica. Yes, that was the Trump plan, sup-
ported by the same Republicans who 
today are saying they won’t even cast 
a vote to acknowledge that they did it, 
and it added to the deficit. 
By 2027, 83 percent of the benefits of 
the Trump tax cuts, supported by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL and the Republicans, 
will go exclusively to the top 1 percent 
of wage earners in America. Republican 
Senators passed those tax cuts all on 
their own through reconciliation. 
I will tell you this. I didn’t vote for 
it. No Democrats voted for it. What we 
are doing today is paying the piper, ac-
knowledging that this is a legitimate 
debt of this country. We can change 
policy going forward, but since we en-
acted those tax cuts 4 years ago, it has 
added to the national debt. And we ac-
knowledge 
it 
today, 
and 
Senator 
MCCONNELL and the Republicans refuse 
to acknowledge it. 
During Trump’s one term in office, 
the national debt increased by almost 
36 percent—4 years: 36 percent. Our Re-
publican colleagues voted to raise the 
Federal debt ceiling once and to sus-
pend it twice during Donald Trump. 
And the Democrats stood with them 
because we understood that this is just 
basic requirement 101 of constitutional 
government. We shared the responsi-
bility not because we agreed with his 
policies—we don’t—but because we un-
derstood that defaulting on the na-
tional debt could cause real damage to 
America. 
What would the costs of defaulting 
on our debt be exactly? According to 
some economists, we would see an esti-
mated $15 trillion of household wealth 
wiped out, 6 million jobs lost, and a 9- 
percent unemployment rate. Every last 
American would feel the pain. If it con-
tinued for any period of time, it would 
threaten retirement funds, Social Se-
curity checks, even job security. 
Mark Zandi, a pretty well-respected 
economist with Moody’s, warned that a 
default on America’s debt would trig-
ger ‘‘financial Armageddon,’’ threat-
ening America’s status as a world re-
serve currency, all because the Repub-
licans refuse to acknowledge debt they 
voted for and created under Republican 
President Donald Trump. 
Even toying with the notion of de-
fault would have severe consequences. 
Back in 2011, House Republicans ini-
tially refused to raise the debt limit. 
America’s credit rating was down-
graded because of it. The result: higher 
borrowing costs and confidence in 
American leadership shaken globally. 
We will see if every Republican will 
fall under the dictates of Senator 
MCCONNELL when it comes to default-
ing on America’s debt for the first 
time, and we will also see what the re-
action to that is going to be. 
This measure we are going to vote on 
in about 2 hours suspends the debt ceil-
ing to avoid default by the govern-
ment, and it keeps the government 
open, just that basic. After all that we 
have been through and what we are 
going through with the pandemic, how 
can the Republicans play with this 
deadly economic strategy? 
Without a continuing resolution, the 
Federal Government will shut down in 
less than 4 days. With the Delta vari-
ant still taking 2,000 American lives a 
day, this is no time to shut down the 
Federal Government. With victims of 
hurricanes and floods and wildfires des-
perate for help, this is not the time to 
close the doors of the Agencies that 
can help them. With our economy still 
recovering, now is not the time to dam-
age it, intentionally, for political rea-
sons. 
Right now, our No. 1 priority is keep-
ing our Nation’s economy on a path to 
recovery and helping families through 
a difficult time. We need to come to-
gether and fund the government. That 
is our fundamental responsibility. We 
need to pay our bills on time. We need 
to provide financial relief to Americans

who are battling disasters, whether 
they are in California or Oregon, Lou-
isiana or Illinois, or Hawaii. And we 
need to grow our economy for future 
generations, 
increasing 
funding 
for 
childcare and healthcare and help for 
working families. 
President Biden’s Build Back Better 
plan is a proven investment in our eco-
nomic future. It includes the largest 
middle-class tax cut in history. 
Do you know what the Republicans 
call the largest middle-class tax cut in 
history? Socialism. Socialism. I heard 
Senator MCCONNELL say it: They just 
want to pursue socialism. The largest 
tax cut for working families and chil-
dren in American history. 
Unlike President Trump’s tax give-
away to the rich, which Senator 
MCCONNELL voted for and doesn’t want 
to pay for, the Build Back Better plan 
will have the corporations pay their 
fair share. 
No one—this is a promise by Presi-
dent Biden to be held to—no one who 
makes $400,000 a year or less will pay 
more in taxes. He has been pretty clear 
on that, hasn’t he? So this notion that 
we are going through some socialist 
tax-and-spend scheme here just isn’t 
true. 
Seven months after he signed his tax 
cut into law, Donald Trump told the ef-
fervescent Sean Hannity of FOX News 
that: ‘‘When [the Trump tax cut] kicks 
in, we’ll start to pay off the debt like 
it’s water’’—Donald Trump. That was a 
con. 
Now the bills are coming due, and the 
Republicans are racing for the exits. It 
is time to stop this ruse and fraud on 
the American people. We need to pay 
our bills, act responsibly, and actually 
help working families. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
DUCKWORTH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
this afternoon to bring further atten-
tion to the growing humanitarian and 
national security crisis we see at our 
southern border. 
President Biden’s and Vice President 
HARRIS’s handling of the southern bor-
der has been as incompetent as it has 
been inhumane. This is not a partisan 
view: their own special envoy to Haiti 
has resigned in protest. 
This administration is in denial; it is 
in denial about the scope of this crisis. 
Migrant crossings into the United 
States have already reached historic 
levels and, as I speak, thousands con-
tinue to arrive along our U.S.-Mexico 
border. 
Since taking office, President Biden 
and 
Vice 
President 
HARRIS
have 
shirked responsibility for this crisis by 
placing blame on the historic levels of 
illegal crossing on everything from 
COVID–19 to climate change, to former 
President Trump. They are hoping 
Americans will forget that President 
Biden’s first order of business was to 
repeal nearly every immigration policy 
of the previous administration. 
The Biden administration’s talking 
points say our borders are closed, but 
their actions indicate just the opposite. 
More than 12,000 of the Haitians who 
gathered under the bridge in Del Rio 
over the past week have been released 
into the country. 
This is not a new policy—tens of 
thousands of migrants who have ille-
gally crossed our border have been re-
leased since President Biden took of-
fice. Many were released without a 
court date and given nothing more 
than a list of ICE offices around the 
country, with instructions to report 
within 60 days. 
Unsurprisingly, it was reported in 
July that nearly 87 percent of 50,000 in-
dividuals released without a court date 
fail to report as directed. This is a 
clear message that, if you make it to 
the United States, you will be allowed 
to stay without facing repercussions. 
This encourages families to make the 
dangerous trek north and entrust their 
safety to dangerous drug cartels at the 
risk of being murdered, assaulted, or 
trafficked because the reward is worth 
the risk. 
The Haitian refugees who recently 
began arriving at the U.S.-Mexico bor-
der are evidence of that mindset. They 
believed the administration’s actions, 
not their words. They watched as thou-
sands were allowed to stay in the coun-
try, and they gambled that they, too, 
would get the same treatment; that 
after living nearly a decade in coun-
tries like Brazil and Chile, now is the 
time to come. 
Nearly 9 months into the Biden Pres-
idency, it is irrefutable that this ad-
ministration’s policies are fueling, are 
increasing the crisis both for our secu-
rity and the humanity of people. 
The historic levels of crossing at the 
southern border have not only created 
this humanitarian crisis and put an in-
credible strain on our immigration sys-
tem, but have seriously compromised 
our national security. 
In April, a few months ago, I visited 
the border and had the opportunity to 
speak with Agents of the FBI and DEA 
to hear firsthand how the crisis has af-
fected their operations and the chal-
lenges it has created for them in car-
rying out their mission to disrupt 
transnational criminal organizations 
and apprehend major drug traffickers. 
The cartels that operate in Central 
America are sophisticated, adaptable, 
and ruthless. Not only do they take ad-
vantage of individuals attempting the 
trek to our southern border by forcing 
them to pay thousands of dollars to 
fund their operations and subject them 
to abuse, rape, and murder, they use 
these individuals to their strategic ad-
vantage. They will send thousands of 
individuals across the border at the 
same time in an attempt to overwhelm 
while cartels bring drugs and guns un-
detected. 
Just today, the DEA issued a public 
safety alert to warn against the alarm-
ing increase in counterfeit prescription 
pills containing fentanyl and meth 
that are being trafficked in the United 
States. Thus far this year, more than 
9.5 million counterfeit pills have been 
seized—a rate that puts 2021 on a path 
to more seizures than the last 3 years 
combined. This is no coincidence. 
The administration’s decision to con-
tinue ignoring this humanitarian and 
national security crisis is allowing a 
horrible situation to get even worse. 
Actions always speak louder than 
words. The Biden administration must 
take immediate action to secure the 
border and enforce our immigration 
laws. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I have noticed over the past few 
months that my Democratic colleagues 
have developed a habit of explaining 
away the anger of the citizens of this 
country. There is anger, and there is 
frustration. And what they do is to do 
a little turn in the conversation and 
make it the cause of the citizens. 
It is kind of blaming it on them in-
stead of looking at themselves as Mem-
bers of the Senate and saying, ‘‘You 
know, what could we do better?’’ 
What I have seen is my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle demand to 
know what is wrong with the American 
people; how could they not be on board 
with President Biden’s so-called trans-
formative agenda—change it all? Why 
won’t they stand by and let us spend 
the country into economic oblivion 
while businesses fail, Main Streets see 
shuttered businesses, and once-safe 
border communities are being turned 
into war zones? 
You see, what they are really doing 
is trying to force the American people 
to adjust and abandon their prin-
ciples—things that they have long be-
lieved, the founding first principles of 
this country. They want them to aban-
don that—abandon their expectations, 
and then accommodate the miserable 
failure that is Joe Biden’s first few 
months in office. He has been wrong 
about most all of it. 
I honestly believe that many of the 
Democratic leaders have it wrong on 
this. The people aren’t the ones who 
need to adjust. That burden belongs to 
the Democratic leadership—in the Sen-
ate, in the House, in the White House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6688 
September 27, 2021 
No matter how they try to dress it up 
or change it or smile, they are fast- 
tracking the road to socialism. 
The anger bubbling to the surface 
didn’t come from out of nowhere. Con-
trary to popular belief, outrage is not 
our natural state, no. What you are 
seeing is beyond buyer’s remorse or 
even buyer’s fear. It is buyer’s anger, 
righteous anger, at what they see hap-
pening; and it is the culmination of al-
most a year’s worth of confusion, fear, 
frustration at the Biden administra-
tion for how they have failed to lead— 
weak leadership. 
You see, the American people aren’t 
accustomed to watching their leaders 
intentionally—intentionally—jeop-
ardize our security and prosperity on 
such a fundamental level. They are 
looking at all that has fallen apart and 
realizing that things are the way they 
are because President Biden and the 
Democratic leadership wants it to be 
this way. This is intentional. 
On day one, President Biden halted 
construction of the border wall and left 
those crossings wide open to drug traf-
fickers, to sex traffickers, human traf-
fickers, and gangs—basically hung out 
the ‘‘y’all come, you’re welcome’’ sign, 
opening that southern border. 
They did this knowing that hundreds 
of thousands of migrants were already 
on their way from Mexico and Central 
America. One hundred fifty countries 
this year have crossed that border ille-
gally, and that—the vast majority of 
them would pay the cartels for their 
passage north by serving as drug 
mules, as prostitutes. What is being 
done to women and children is really 
awful. It is a humanitarian crisis. 
If they wanted to, Biden and the 
Democrats could put themselves be-
tween us and that threat. They could 
support strong immigration policies 
that protect refugees and also secure 
the border. It is possible, but they have 
refused to do it. Instead, they are fun-
neling crowds of unvetted migrants 
into American communities and ena-
bling the cartels to traffic women and 
children across State lines with impu-
nity. 
How dare they? How dare they traffic 
like they are trafficking? 
Ignoring this problem isn’t humani-
tarianism. It is not anti-racism. It is 
dangerous and exposes an appalling 
lack of wisdom on the part of the 
President; the Vice President, who is 
supposed to be the border czar; and 
their advisers. 
This administration seems to believe 
that threats to our national security 
will evaporate if we ignore them: Just 
don’t think about it; don’t talk about 
it; what you are seeing, you are really 
not seeing. 
What they are doing is creating pol-
icy in a bubble, which works well for 
grad seminars but fails miserably when 
there are lives on the line. 
The Biden administration failed in 
Afghanistan. Now, we can argue for the 
next decade—and I am sure we will— 
about lessons learned, but here is what 
the American people see: The Biden ad-
ministration gave a terrorist organiza-
tion the benefit of the doubt. 
That is right. They trusted the words 
of the Taliban above the words of the 
commanders on the ground. The com-
manders on the ground warned that 
such an abrupt withdrawal would end 
in chaos and casualties. 
But you know what? They wanted to 
be out by September 11. They wanted 
that date circled on the calendar. Joe 
Biden wanted to be the President who 
ended the war, but all he has done is 
emboldened the terrorists. And the war 
on terror continues. It continues. He 
ended nothing with the war on terror. 
We came out of Afghanistan, but now 
the families of 13 American service-
members are left to grieve, while State 
Department 
officials 
make 
absurd 
claims about the power of diplomacy 
and the Taliban’s role in regional poli-
tics, all the while ignoring the allies 
and the partners they abandoned. They 
still don’t know how many Americans, 
how many of our SIV holders, appli-
cants, their families are left behind 
enemy lines. 
And the people? The people in Ten-
nessee whom I talk with when I go 
home every weekend—they are watch-
ing this. They are astounded, and they 
cannot believe what they are seeing 
the Democratic Party do. 
There is no reason, no account-
ability, no incentive to trust that the 
self-proclaimed ‘‘adults in the room’’ 
know what is best. 
Especially when it comes to the econ-
omy, Tennesseans can see a socialist 
agenda pulling the strings. Right now, 
they are staring down the barrel of a 
$3.5 trillion budget that the Democrats 
have weaponized against personal re-
sponsibility and decentralized control. 
Just seeing that pricetag was bad 
enough, and now we are hearing the 
pricetag is growing. 
But, now, Tennesseans know that the 
Democrats don’t even care how much 
this costs nor do they care that, if all 
goes to plan, American businesses will 
carry a heavier tax burden than com-
munist China. That is correct. The 
American businesses will have a higher 
tax burden than those in communist 
China. Living life as we know it will be 
too expensive for most of us to afford. 
No serious person could stand here on 
the floor of the Senate and pretend to 
be shocked at the level of anger and 
frustration that we are seeing back 
home. I talk to people every single 
week who feel betrayed—betrayed—by 
this administration. They feel unsafe. 
Many of the Tennesseans I speak to 
every day who voted for President 
Biden wish they had made another 
choice in the voting booth because, 
yes, they voted for the President, but 
they did not vote for this. They did not 
vote for the Afghanistan withdrawal 
and the manner we came out. They did 
not vote to embolden the communist 
Chinese. They did not vote for open 
borders. They did not vote for inflation 
that is skyrocketing, taxes—$2 trillion 
of taxes coming their way. No, they did 
not vote for that, and this is what 
makes them angry. 
I hear their anger with every tele-
phone townhall, with every conversa-
tion. I hear their frustration. They are 
angry at the White House officials who 
use the full force of the U.S. Govern-
ment to cover up their mistakes and 
try to make it sound like it is the prob-
lem of the people, because they know 
they have messed up. 
And the people have every right to be 
angry. The things we do in this Cham-
ber don’t exist in a bubble. They have 
real world consequences for real people 
who have real lives that they are living 
every day, and they know that they are 
beginning to live these lives in a more 
dangerous 
setting: 
crime 
on 
the 
streets, crime on the rise, open borders, 
unvetted migrants coming to their 
communities, 
COVID, 
measles 
out-
breaks. 
They are angry. They have ‘‘buyer’s 
anger.’’ I like to say, as I talk to 
women: Security moms are back. They 
are back in full force. They are back 
because they don’t like the crime in 
the streets. They want safe commu-
nities. They want their children safe. 
They want their children who are going 
to college this fall to be safe. They are 
upset 
with 
the 
Afghanistan 
with-
drawal, with the continuation of the 
war on terror, and that their children 
are going to have to go refight this. 
They are angry, and we hear their 
anger, and we know it is time for Mem-
bers in this Chamber to stop playing 
politics with how much spending you 
can force out the door and address 
these problems that moms and dads 
and Americans across this country are 
faced with each and every day. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
later this evening, the Democrat-con-
trolled Senate will hold a vote on an-
other dead-on-arrival bill. 
This time, though, it isn’t just a mes-
saging bill designed to put on a show 
for their far left. This is legislation 
that is actually critical to the stability 
of our government, our economy, and 
the livelihood of millions of public 
servants. 
For months now, Republicans have 
made clear, though, we will not split 
the ticket when it comes to Democrats’ 
reckless tax-and-spending spree. We 
will not vote to raise the debt limit 
just so Democrats can spend another 
$3.5 trillion and add that to the Amer-
ican people’s credit card in a purely 
partisan exercise. 
If this was ever a secret, it was the 
worst kept secret in Washington, DC.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6689 
September 27, 2021 
But our Democratic colleagues simply 
can’t resist a chance to virtue signal 
even if it wastes valuable floor time 
here in the Senate. 
We have seen this before. In fact, 
Democrats’ 
designed-to-fail 
agenda 
practically dominated the Senate’s cal-
endar this summer. There was a bill to 
exploit the cause of gender pay fairness 
in order to line the pockets of trial 
lawyers. There was legislation to over-
haul America’s election system and 
hand Democrats a permanent gov-
erning majority. The latest version of 
this bill, which will also fail, will come 
up for a vote in a matter of days. 
Senator SCHUMER has even forecasted 
votes on other bills that were so un-
popular, as it turned out, that they 
didn’t even make it to the Senate floor. 
There was one that would have eroded 
American’s Second Amendment rights 
and another that would punish schools 
and hospitals that refused to comply 
with ‘‘woke’’ social norms. 
Now, this isn’t an agenda to better 
the lives of the American people or pro-
tect the country from global threats. It 
is pandering, pure and simple. While 
pandering to their radical base is the 
focus of the Democrat-led Senate, 
there are a number of threats this body 
should actually address. The most ob-
vious is the need to prevent another 
government shutdown. 
Let’s not forget the Biden border cri-
sis on our southern border. For the en-
tirety of President Biden’s term of of-
fice, Democrats have refused to ac-
knowledge any sort of problem at all 
with our southern border because, ap-
parently, they don’t actually believe in 
borders or apparently care little about 
the drugs smuggled into this country 
that took the lives of 90,000 Americans 
last year alone. Even as hundreds of 
thousands of migrants poured across 
our border every month, Democrats 
showed no concern or didn’t even ac-
knowledge that there was a problem. 
Then things came to a head. Finally, 
the news media began to pay attention 
to Del Rio. Within a matter of days, 
30,000 
migrants—nearly 
30,000, 
pri-
marily from Haiti—crossed the border 
and set up camp under the Inter-
national Bridge in Del Rio, TX. Early 
statements indicated that the adminis-
tration would make heavy use of title 
42, which is a public health title de-
signed to protect the American people 
against the spread of COVID–19. Early 
statements indicated the administra-
tion would make use of that public 
health title and expedited removal to 
return these individuals to their home 
countries. It sounded like a pretty re-
markably sensible strategy. 
But now that the migrant camp has 
been cleared, we know that is not what 
happened. Only about 2,000 migrants 
were returned to Haiti, a small per-
centage 
of 
the 
nearly 
30,000 
who 
crossed into Del Rio. Some 8,000 volun-
tarily returned to Mexico, but I expect 
many of those migrants and their fami-
lies will make another attempt to reen-
ter the United States. Another 5,000 of 
that number are currently being proc-
essed by the Department of Homeland 
Security. 
In a television appearance this week-
end, Secretary Mayorkas said 10 to 
12,000 migrants, the ones that were 
huddled under the bridge in Del Rio, 
TX—10 to 12,000 migrants—have been 
released into the United States, untest-
ed for COVID–19, unvaccinated, when, 
in fact, the Biden administration has 
said that the public health title 42 was 
going to be used to exclude them. 
Well, those numbers are likely to 
grow in the coming days because, 
frankly, all the Biden administration 
was concerned about, apparently, was 
the bad optics of 30,000 migrants 
huddled under a border bridge in Del 
Rio, TX. 
What the Biden administration did, 
as opposed to what they said they were 
going to do, is an open invitation for 
more migrants to illegally come to the 
United States. Individuals who are try-
ing to decide whether to make the dan-
gerous journey to our borders are read-
ing the same headlines and watching 
the same TV news shows that we are, 
and many of them are simply calling 
their relatives in the United States 
saying: Should I still come? 
And they are being given the green 
light because of the failure of the Biden 
administration to do anything to deter 
or to sway or to add costs to people il-
legally entering the United States. In 
so doing, the Biden administration is 
sending an unmistakable message to 
more migrants to come to the United 
States because, if you do, there is a 
good chance you will be released into 
the American countryside and dis-
appear into that great American heart-
land. Migrants will ignore what Presi-
dent Biden is saying because they 
know what his administration is doing 
or, in this case, not doing, which is not 
securing the borders. 
Unless something changes, the Hai-
tian migration and the crisis in Del Rio 
that fixated the attention of the news 
media and all America—unless some-
thing changes from a policy perspec-
tive, this is going to happen again. 
We already know that border cross-
ings are at their highest levels in 20 
years. Now the administration is ap-
parently opening the door to even more 
illegal migration. And the smuggling 
organizations—the 
organized 
crime 
syndicates that profit from charging 
these migrants thousands of dollars to 
get them into the country—will con-
tinue to get rich because of the admin-
istration’s unwillingness to enforce our 
immigration laws. 
Well, Congress has a duty to take ac-
tion and address this crisis before it 
grows even more out of control. Demo-
crats cannot ignore the responsibility 
to enforce our laws and secure our bor-
ders just because it upsets part of their 
political base. 
There are a lot of things we need to 
do in the Senate, and this parade of 
dead-on-arrival bills does nothing to 
move us in the right direction. Clearly, 
our Democratic colleagues are finding 
their 
newfound 
majority—they 
are 
having a lot of trouble using this power 
to actually govern. They have a wide 
gulf between the so-called moderates of 
their party—what they can stomach 
and what the progressive leftwing de-
mands. 
They are up against the government 
funding deadline in just the next few 
days that could risk a shutdown during 
what is already tough economic times 
for many Americans because of the 
pandemic. They are trying to use a par-
tisan budgetary process to pass tril-
lions of dollars of more deficit-spend-
ing while also trying to get another 
trillion-dollar 
infrastructure 
bill 
signed into law. To top things off, they 
have fanned the flames of the crisis at 
our border, struggled to defend an inde-
fensible, disastrous withdrawal from 
Afghanistan, and offended America’s 
oldest ally. This is not what governing 
looks like. 
There is no spotlight on a party like 
there is when you hold all the cards— 
when you control the White House, the 
House, and the Senate. The American 
people know who is responsible for the 
status quo. When the majority party 
all but refuses to work with the minor-
ity party, that spotlight grows even 
brighter. 
I hope—but frankly I don’t expect— 
that our Democrats will reevaluate the 
wisdom of this parade of failed bills 
and spend a little bit of time working 
with Republicans on legislation that 
could actually pass and make a posi-
tive difference for our country. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
in recent days, much has been said 
about Afghanistan. I spoke about it 
last time on September 15, and most of 
my colleagues have spoken on the very 
same subject. I come to speak more 
about it. Today, I will look at it from 
a very different angle. I am going to 
look at it from the angle that you see 
through the Inspector General lens. 
The sudden collapse of the Afghan 
Government and the Afghan Army 
threw me right back to years of over-
sight work and audits conducted by the 
Special Inspector General for Afghani-
stan Reconstruction. Now, the termi-
nology ‘‘Special Inspector General for 
Afghanistan Reconstruction’’ goes by 
the acronym SIGAR. That person goes 
by the name of his real name, Mr. John 
Sopko. 
SIGAR, in its reports, pulled no 
punches. Report after report over the 
years exposed and documented grim al-
legations of weak security, systemic

September 27, 2021 
corruption, and waste—waste of tax-
payers’ dollars. Those core problems 
were brushed aside and allowed to eat 
away at the foundation of our commit-
ment. In other words, our leaders were 
not heeding the warnings from the In-
spector General, Mr. John Sopko. 
An inability to solve these problems 
prompted SIGAR to send warning sig-
nals. Those warning signals said our 
mission in Afghanistan was failing. 
And that is not a recent conclusion; 
that is things he stated over and over, 
over the years. This was all to the det-
riment of U.S. foreign policy and our 
national security—the fact that most 
of SIGAR’s advice fell on deaf ears. 
SIGAR was like a lone wolf, howling 
out there in the wilderness. 
As the final scene of the Afghan trag-
edy unfolded, as we all saw on tele-
vision at the Kabul Airport, in those 
circumstances, President Biden cut and 
run. He assigned blame squarely on the 
Afghans’ shoulders, but that is not the 
whole truth. Just pick up any SIGAR 
report; it is plain to see in those re-
ports that something was wrong. We 
were the chief architect and financier 
for the lion’s share of the construction 
in Afghanistan that collapsed. If we are 
to learn from this experience, we need 
to begin by looking in the mirror. 
SIGAR’s ‘‘lessons learned reports’’ 
clearly indicate that security against 
the Taliban threat was a top priority. 
According to SIGAR, security was 
never achieved. Based on repeated as-
sessments of the army’s readiness, 
SIGAR concluded that the Afghan 
Army lacked the capability to inde-
pendently defend the country against 
internal and external threats, contrary 
to President Biden’s hailing the capa-
bility of the Afghan military to pre-
serve the country and defend it from 
the Taliban. 
And without security, nation build-
ing was a nonstarter. Now we question 
whether or not nation building ought 
to be part of the policy, but it seemed 
to be too often. 
When coupled with the systemic cor-
ruption I just mentioned—and SIGAR 
characterized that as an ‘‘existential 
threat . . . that eroded army readi-
ness’’—prospects for survival of the 
government and the army of Afghans 
doing their job were very dim. 
Against advice that I have given pre-
vious administrations, the President 
announced the date certain for pulling 
out the U.S. military. And, by the way, 
that wasn’t wise because you never tell 
your enemies what your plans are. 
So within days, the Taliban elimi-
nated the Afghan Army with hardly a 
struggle. The Taliban then seized U.S. 
military assets. 
The Biden administration left Ameri-
cans and Afghan allies behind enemy 
lines. Adding tragedy to the deeply 
flawed military exit, a U.S. drone 
strike killed 10 civilians. 
There is clear and present urgency 
for accountability. Do my fellow Sen-
ators pay appropriate attention to the 
work of the IGs throughout govern-
ment? Maybe not often enough, but 
surely listening to SIGAR, not enough 
of us listened to him. 
Afghanistan’s collapse underscores 
the merits of SIGAR’s work out of 
three dozen confirmed IGs. IGs do im-
portant work, and their work should be 
considered greatly. And the fact that 
we ignored SIGAR’s work in Afghani-
stan is a tragedy, particularly when 
the people in the executive branch of 
government ignored it. 
SIGAR was created to watchdog the 
huge sums of money pouring into Af-
ghanistan. Mr. Sopko, the IG, did his 
job well. He issued aggressive, hard-hit-
ting reports, documenting egregious 
waste and blatant corruption on both 
sides—our side and the Afghan side. 
Large sums of money simply dis-
appeared. 
In a recent report, SIGAR served up a 
classic case of waste and corruption, 
and he did it on a silver platter. It is 
symptomatic of the rot that derailed 
our efforts in Afghanistan. 
One example involved the purchase of 
20 refurbished Italian G222 medium-lift 
aircraft for the Afghan Air Force. They 
added $549 million to the taxpayers’ 
tab. These aircraft were needed but 
unsupportable and inoperable. 
The squandering on this project was 
matched by others exposed by SIGAR, 
like the 64,000 square-foot surge com-
mand center that was built for $34 mil-
lion but never needed and never occu-
pied. 
The G222 aircraft was just another 
notch in Uncle Sam’s belt of wasteful 
spending. Those planes were thrown in 
the junk heap because of crooked mis-
management—and that was on our 
side. 
The Air Force general who led the 
program while on Active Duty, and 
then as vice president for the company 
selling the Italian aircraft, allegedly 
violated criminal conflict-of-interest 
statutes. 
SIGAR wanted to pursue criminal 
charges, but the Department of Justice 
refused to prosecute. The Department 
of Justice turned a blind eye to the 
general’s alleged misconduct. Let that 
sink in. 
A half-billion taxpayer dollars went 
up in smoke, and no one was held to ac-
count. At a minimum, this reckless 
spending demanded disciplinary action. 
With little or no accountability, it was 
easy for crooks to line their pockets 
with schemes like the G222 aircraft. 
Now, SIGAR exposed that. It wasn’t 
prosecuted, but SIGAR nailed quite a 
few. Investigations resulted in 160 
criminal convictions. Corruption was 
found on both sides. 
The convicted included 42 Afghanis, 
58 U.S. military personnel, 49 U.S. con-
tractors, and 11 U.S. Government per-
sonnel and citizens. 
Some money was recovered, but obvi-
ously you don’t recover all of it. How-
ever, in such a target-rich environ-
ment, I suspect that SIGAR’s inves-
tigators barely scratched the surface. 
Unfortunately, while SIGAR’s finger 
was stuck in the dike, Uncle Sam kept 
spending money—kept the spigot wide 
open. Some estimate that over $2 tril-
lion flowed through the pipe to a gov-
ernment and an army known by SIGAR 
to be riddled with systemic corruption. 
We tolerated it, and the money kept 
flowing. 
What happened in Afghanistan boils 
down to the fundamental principle of 
good government. Oversight is critical 
to accountability. SIGAR has more 
work to do. SIGAR will need to provide 
a full accounting for all the captured 
and abandoned weapons and equip-
ment. 
You see a figure of $85 billion of that 
stuff left over there for the Taliban to 
use for whatever they want to use it 
for—hopefully, 
never 
against 
the 
United States. 
The IG will need to track down unex-
pended dollars in the pipeline, esti-
mated at $61⁄2 billion or more, so those 
tax dollars can be returned to the 
Treasury or allocated for other legiti-
mate and needed purposes. 
The IG will need to investigate alle-
gations that high officials fled with 
hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in 
cash. And we are told that one of those 
was the former President. The most re-
cent President of Afghanistan got away 
with millions and millions of dollars. 
Now, if true, this would be more 
proof of systemic corruption that was 
the country’s undoing. Stolen tax dol-
lars should be recovered. 
The House Defense authorization bill 
already instructs SIGAR to address 
these and other issues. I call on the 
Senate Armed Services Committee to 
adopt those same measures and author-
ize funding needed to finish the job by 
SIGAR. 
Congress needs to know why SIGAR’s 
alarm bells on poor security, corrup-
tion, and waste were largely ignored. 
They were unmistakable indicators of 
the impending collapse that we now 
know has happened to the country of 
Afghanistan—to the Taliban. 
Once the decision was made to pull 
out U.S. troops in early 2020, prepara-
tions for evacuations were mandatory. 
So then why did our President make 
such a panicked and haphazard exit? 
Did no one see the warnings coming 
and the signs that showed what would 
happen? Did the military fail to de-
velop an orderly exit strategy and 
evacuation plan, as alleged by Sec-
retary Blinken? 
If true, who is responsible for that 
blunder? 
A 
congressional 
autopsy 
might help us avoid the same mistakes 
in the future. It might help us put for-
ward a better foot to strengthen stra-
tegic alliances. 
As painful as it may be, we must 
never give up trying to learn from our 
past mistakes. We still face threats 
from terrorist groups with the same 
ideology as the 9/11 attackers have. 
And you know where they got their 
training—in Afghanistan. 
We still have troops in many coun-
tries combating terrorism in partner-
ship with local forces. We can’t afford

just move on and forget about it. 
Without some soul searching, Amer-
ica risks further humiliation like we 
have just witnessed, which will only 
embolden our would-be adversaries. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
(The remarks of Mr. TUBERVILLE per-
taining to the introduction of S. 2857 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
EXTENDING GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND 
DELIVERING EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE ACT 
Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I 
had hoped to be standing here today 
making a statement in support of the 
bill before us. For weeks, Chairman 
LEAHY and I, along with chairs and 
ranking members of the subcommit-
tees of the Appropriations Committee, 
worked cooperatively to produce a bi-
partisan package—a package that in-
cludes a continuing resolution to keep 
the government operating, as well as, 
two, emergency supplemental funding 
for disaster relief, and, three, to sup-
port those who needed rescuing fol-
lowing the President’s hasty with-
drawal from Afghanistan. 
Bipartisan support for anything is a 
rare commodity around here. Senator 
LEAHY and I know that. But we have 
experienced bipartisan support with 
each other in the past, and it works. It 
is something that should be embraced 
and, I hope, emulated. 
We nearly got our work done, as ap-
propriators so often do, but larger 
forces intervened. We are not by our-
selves here. Leadership on the other 
side of the aisle intervened to pursue 
partisanship over comity and sabotage 
over constructive engagement by, I be-
lieve, unnecessarily forcing the debt 
limit increase into what would other-
wise be a bipartisan package. 
The 
Republican 
leader, 
Senator 
MCCONNELL, has been clear. We will not 
support any effort to increase the debt 
limit. The road to success was clearly 
marked; nevertheless, my Democratic 
colleagues chose to drive this package 
right into a ditch rather than embrace 
a bipartisan path forward. 
This is not complicated. There is a 
simple solution. Take up and pass a bill 
that was negotiated on a bipartisan, bi-
cameral basis, which has support on 
both sides of the aisle—a bill that, one, 
keeps the government open, which we 
all want to do; two, provides much 
needed disaster assistance to storm- 
ravaged areas of our country; and 
three, delivers the aid necessary to ad-
dress the Afghanistan withdrawal cri-
sis. That is S. 2789, the Shelby-McCon-
nell bill—who is here. 
If we don’t take that path, I believe 
my colleagues on the other side of aisle 
owe the American people some answers 
here. For example, why did they—the 
Democrats—why did they choose to un-
dermine a bipartisan effort to provide 
the American people with desperately 
needed disaster relief? Yes. And why 
did they choose to ignore the imme-
diate needs of Afghans who deserve our 
support? Why are they threatening to 
shut down the government now that we 
have an alternative that would avoid 
that outcome? 
This does not have to happen. We 
know Thursday is the deadline. Instead 
of accepting victory, my Democratic 
colleagues, I believe, are embracing de-
feat and creating a new crisis that we 
all ought to avoid. 
It is a perilous path they are putting 
the country on, but it still is not too 
late. Today is Monday. We have a few 
days left. The majority can reverse 
course and put us back on track by im-
mediately passing the Shelby-McCon-
nell bill. It will keep the government 
open and provide much needed emer-
gency funding. This is the bill we 
should be considering. I urge the ma-
jority to do so. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
know the speeches on the other side 
have gone a little longer than we ex-
pected, so I ask unanimous consent 
that I have time to complete my state-
ment on the continuing resolution and 
national debt, which will be relatively 
short. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Madam 
President, 
today, the Senate will hold a vote to 
allow for the consideration of a tem-
porary, stopgap measure to keep the 
government funded through December 
3. The measure also provides $28 billion 
to help States ravaged by hurricanes 
and wildfires, like Hurricane Ida that 
recently tore through both the South 
and the Northeast. It provides critical 
assistance to Afghan refugees who fled 
the Taliban in the wake of the U.S. 
withdrawal from Afghanistan. Finally, 
it will raise the debt ceiling to Decem-
ber 2022, including the $8 billion of debt 
that was incurred under President 
Trump. 
Now, this shouldn’t even be a close 
call. A government shutdown, if we had 
one, would needlessly cost the tax-
payers billions of dollars—billions of 
dollars—throughout our country. It 
would throw hundreds of thousands of 
people out of work. A government de-
fault would be catastrophic. And that 
is all completely avoidable. 
Yet, in the wake of the deadliest pan-
demic our country has seen in over 100 
years and in the wake of natural disas-
ters that have left a trail of death and 
destruction, the Republican leader and 
his party have decided to play a dan-
gerous 
game 
of 
political 
brinksmanship. They have chosen—and 
it was a free choice on their part—to 
withhold their votes and prevent this 
bill from even being debated, threat-
ening to shut down the U.S. Govern-
ment—the U.S. Government—and have 
it default on its debts for the first time 
in the history of our great country. 
I think that is the height of irrespon-
sibility and callousness. It is also pret-
ty hypocritical, because who pays the 
price for this political brinksmanship? 
Not the Republican leadership careen-
ing us towards disaster but the Amer-
ican people. A government shutdown 
has serious consequences for people 
just trying to make ends meet—sup-
port their families, live their lives. 
Important food and nutrition pro-
grams—SNAP and WIC—would dry up 
in a matter of days, leaving millions of 
Americans in the wealthiest Nation on 
Earth without the help they need to 
put food on the table. 
Also, I look at our Nation’s schools 
that are struggling to reopen after a 
pandemic. Assistance to those schools 
would be delayed. 
Then we look at our public health re-
sponse to the mental health and sub-
stance abuse crisis. That would be se-
verely hampered. And we cannot forget 
that we have an epidemic of drug 
overdoses in this country happening 
alongside the COVID pandemic. 
The Small Business Administration 
that provides so much assistance to 
our Nation’s small businesses—I be-
lieve, as I said many times on this 
floor, that small businesses are the 
backbone of the American economy— 
would be forced to close the door. 
More than half of the CDC would be 
furloughed just weeks after COVID 
deaths passed the grim toll of the 1918 
pandemic in our own country and right 
before the start of the annual flu sea-
son. 
These are just a few examples of the 
needless pain a government shutdown 
would cause. 
As painful as a government shutdown 
would be, the consequences of default-
ing on our debt for the first time, the 
first time in American history—that is 
even worse. The government of the 
wealthiest country in the world would 
not have funds to operate, meet its ob-
ligations, and pay its debts. 
The last time we even toyed with 
such an irresponsible idea, the credit 
rating of the U.S. Government was 
downgraded for the first time in his-
tory, and, boy, that cost every Amer-
ican, directly or indirectly, money. It 
certainly hurt businesses all over our 
country. 
If we were to default on our debt, 
then the women and men of the mili-
tary would be handed IOUs in exchange 
for their bravery defending our coun-
try; Social Security checks that people 
earned and rely on to survive would 
stop; and the economy would take such 
a hit from which it would be hard to re-
cover. The stock market would no 
doubt take a dive and then put millions 
of Americans’ lifetime savings at risk. 
All of this as we are still recovering 
economically from the last 18 months 
of a global pandemic. And for what? So 
Republicans can make campaign com-
mercials claiming they are the party of 
fiscal responsibility and do that with a 
straight face? Come on.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6692 
September 27, 2021 
While President Trump was in office, 
U.S. debt increased by $8 trillion—$51⁄2 
trillion alone since we last raised the 
debt ceiling under President Trump. 
Incidentally, on that one, because it 
was so important to the country, there 
was bipartisan support for it. 
Republicans’ irresponsible tax cut for 
the wealthiest Americans is partly to 
blame, but Democrats still supported 
the Trump administration when it 
needed to raise the debt limit to ac-
count for the resulting bills because, if 
we did otherwise, everybody in this 
country was going to be hurt. It would 
have been irresponsible. It would have 
been dangerous for the U.S. economy. 
The argument made by my col-
leagues that Republicans will not sup-
port raising the debt limit because 
they are not going to support the tax- 
and-spend policies of the Democrats— 
well, it is probably just as well that 
many people wear masks these days be-
cause it hides their smiles, because 
that argument does not hold water. 
The bills they falsely claim to be so-
cialist bogeymen have not even passed 
Congress, let alone been signed into 
law, and they are going to be fully paid 
for. In 2017, my friend the Republican 
leader chose not to take that path 
when Republicans passed a massive tax 
cut—massive tax cut—for the wealthi-
est in this country, and that was not 
paid for. 
Raising the debt limit is about meet-
ing obligations our country has already 
made, and many of those obligations 
were made under President Trump. So 
playing political games with so much 
on the line—that is as irresponsible as 
it is irrational. 
The bill before us today provides a 
path out of this made-in-Washington 
crisis—a path that could help all of our 
country. It can fund the government 
through December 3. It can raise the 
debt limit through December 2022. It 
could provide relief to communities all 
over our country that have been dev-
astated by natural disasters and pro-
vide assistance for the brave Afghans 
who supported our mission through two 
decades of war. 
So we really have an off-ramp from 
this crisis. I wish my colleagues would 
take it. Vote to advance this bill. 
Stave off an unnecessary crisis. Put 
the American people first, ahead of the 
party. That is actually, I think, a pret-
ty simple choice. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that Senators 
CASSIDY, KENNEDY, and I be allowed to 
complete our remarks prior to the 
vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—SHELBY- 
MCCONNELL AMENDMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. So, Madam Presi-
dent, the Democratic leader has sched-
uled a vote today that he knows will 
fail. For more than 2 months, since 
July, Republicans have been clear 
about where we stand: We are willing 
to work together to keep the govern-
ment open. We are not willing to help 
Democrats raise the debt ceiling while 
they write a reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree of historic proportions behind 
closed doors. 
Democrats control the entire govern-
ment—the 
Senate, 
the 
House, 
the 
White House. They intend to sideline 
Republicans and go it alone to slam 
American families with historic tax 
hikes and borrowing. So they will need 
to raise the debt limit on a partisan 
basis as well. And they have known 
that for 2 months now—2 months. 
Just like then-Senator Biden and 
Senator SCHUMER voted no on a debt 
limit increase and made a unified Re-
publican government handle it alone 
back in the early 2000s, this has hap-
pened before. 
Earlier this year, Senate Democrats 
requested and won additional flexi-
bility to make policy on party lines. 
They have every single tool they need 
to do their job. 
The Democratic leader, the Speaker 
of the House, and the President of the 
United States have had 10 weeks—10— 
to plan for funding the government and 
addressing the debt limit. There never 
had to be one ounce of drama to any of 
this. Any drama here is self-created by 
the Democrats. Republicans continue 
to try to help our Democratic friends 
avoid multiple new crises of their own 
making. 
On the debt limit, Democrats have 
all the time and all the tools to do 
what they have to do, and I have ex-
plained in detail how they need to pro-
ceed. Because Democrats ignored our 
warning back in July, they must 
amend their previous budget resolution 
with debt limit instructions and pro-
ceed through a fast-track process. 
On the more urgent issue, govern-
ment funding, Senator SHELBY and I 
have a clean CR that could pass today. 
Our bill tracks with bipartisan talks. It 
would keep the government open, fund 
disaster relief for Louisiana, and fund 
defensive assistance for our ally Israel 
and their Iron Dome, and it drops the 
debt limit language that Democrats 
have known is a nonstarter for more 
than 2 months. 
The Senate could advance this bill 
tonight. If Democrats will let us, we 
could take a bipartisan step tonight to-
ward guaranteeing there will be no 
government shutdown. If the Demo-
cratic leader lets us, the Senate could 
advance government funding legisla-
tion with a big bipartisan vote yet to-
night. 
The House Democratic majority lead-
er has said they will take up whatever 
CR the Senate sends them. The House 
is ready. Senate Republicans are ready. 
The only holdout is the Senate Demo-
cratic leader and his partisan tactics. 
So, in just a moment, I will ask con-
sent that Democrats forget about the 
vote they know will fail and instead let 
the Senate vote on a bill that can actu-
ally pass. 
It is up to the Democrats. We can ei-
ther move this legislation forward to-
night or we can have a show vote, 
which they know will fail, and inch 
closer toward another crisis of their 
own making. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise supporting my colleague’s pro-
posal. 
This proposal provides disaster sup-
plemental assistance relief for South-
west and Southeast Louisiana; it ex-
tends the National Flood Insurance 
Program; it funds the government; and 
it restores funding for Israel’s Iron 
Dome. 
We are 3 days away from a govern-
ment shutdown for one reason: Demo-
crats control Washington. 
A clean vote on disaster relief and a 
continuing resolution to fund the gov-
ernment—legislation filed by Senators 
MCCONNELL and SHELBY—passes today 
with overwhelming bipartisan support. 
We know that. But my Democratic col-
leagues are holding this critical fund-
ing set not just to fund the government 
but funding set to benefit victims of 
disasters in my State and elsewhere 
hostage to fund their planned tax-and- 
spend extravaganza. 
Disaster victims need disaster relief. 
It is 1 month since Hurricane Ida, 6 
months from unprecedented ice storms, 
12 months since Hurricanes Laura and 
Delta wreaked havoc on Southwest 
Louisiana. Disaster assistance is long 
overdue. This bill gets it done. 
And while we are recovering from 2- 
years’ worth of storms, we can’t allow 
the National Flood Insurance Program 
to expire. Many policyholders, espe-
cially in Louisiana, are still recovering 
from hurricane damage. Government 
shouldn’t pull the rug of insurance 
from beneath them. It is critical the 
program is extended so homeowners 
are covered if there is another storm. 
This proposal extends NFIP. It also 
provides disaster relief. 
The proposal is good for Louisiana. It 
is good for the country. I urge my col-
leagues to support this proposal. 
With that, I yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
rise in support of Senator MCCONNELL’s 
legislation. 
On August 27, 2020, just 13 months 
ago, Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana. 
Forty-five days later, Hurricane Delta 
hit Louisiana. Nineteen days after 
that, Hurricane Zeta hit Louisiana. We 
got a little bit of a break. Four months 
after that, we were part of the historic 
winter storm, about which we have all 
read. And then 3 months after that, we 
had a historic rainfall event in Lou-
isiana, up to 12 inches, unrelated to a 
hurricane. Three months after that, 
Hurricane Ida hit Louisiana. And 2 
weeks later, Hurricane Nicholas hit 
Louisiana. 
Every one of these storms was over 
100 miles per hour sustained winds. The

September 27, 2021 
wind for Hurricane Ida was clocked at 
its highest at 185 miles per hour. If you 
add up all the damages, it is about $150 
billion in 13 months. 
Now, other States were impacted by 
these storms, but Louisiana took it full 
in the face. This was as brutal a blow 
as nature has inflicted on an American 
State in modern history. We will be 
coughing up bones for years, and this 
legislation is going to help us recover. 
In fact, this legislation does every 
single thing that my colleagues Sen-
ator CASSIDY and Senator MCCONNELL 
talked about that my Democratic 
friends want to do, everything: keeps 
government open, maintains flood in-
surance, gives disaster relief not just 
to Louisiana but to my friends in the 
Northeast part of our country, to my 
friends on the west coast. It does help 
my State, Southwest, Southeast, North 
Louisiana, but we are not the only 
ones. 
Senator 
MCCONNELL’s 
legislation 
does everything except one thing, one 
thing: increasing the debt ceiling that 
Senator SCHUMER can do in a matter of 
days on his own. 
Why are we fighting over this? You 
know, nature abhors a moron. It is mo-
ronic for us to be having this fight 
when it can be so easily solved. 
Everything in Senator MCCONNELL’s 
legislation can easily pass this body 
with 70 votes, and we know it. And 
then Senator SCHUMER can come right 
behind by simply amending the budget 
resolution, 
and 
our 
problems 
are 
solved. Nature abhors a moron. Let’s 
don’t be moronic. 
I yield back to Senator MCCONNELL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to Calendar No. 137, H.R. 
5305. I further ask that the first amend-
ment in order be the Shelby-McConnell 
amendment to the text of which is 
identical to Calendar No. 135, S. 2789; 
that there be 2 hours of debate, equally 
divided between the two leaders or 
their designees, and upon the use or 
yielding back of that time, the Shelby- 
McConnell amendment be agreed to; fi-
nally, upon disposition of the Shelby- 
McConnell amendment, the bill, as 
amended, be read a third time and the 
Senate vote on passage of the bill, as 
amended, with a 60-affirmative-vote 
threshold required for passage. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. I have listened to this 
debate. I have also listened to my two 
dear friends from Louisiana speak 
about the disaster recovery, and I sup-
port disaster recovery for that. But I 
would just point out that on the pro-
posal of the Republican leader, there 
would be no funds in the Treasury to 
pay for disaster recovery or for writing 
a check to Israel for the Iron Dome be-
cause it doesn’t raise the debt limit. 
And the substitute offered by my 
friend, introduced by my dear friend 
the vice chairman of the Appropria-
tions Committee, Senator SHELBY, does 
not solve the problem in front of us. It 
doesn’t address the looming debt crisis 
facing our Nation, so it ignores that 
that exists. 
Now, perhaps my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle want to wash 
their hands of this. They can. Much of 
that debt was incurred under a Repub-
lican President and under a Repub-
lican-controlled 
Senate 
and 
debt 
racked up by irresponsible tax cuts 
championed by the Republican Party 
for the wealthiest of Americans. And, 
yes, debt also occurred in a bipartisan 
fashion to deal with multiple crises 
that faced the Nation: Disaster assist-
ance in the wake of hurricanes and 
wildfires keep getting worse every year 
because 
we 
don’t 
combat 
climate 
change; COVID relief to keep this coun-
try from careening head first into eco-
nomic disaster in the wake of a world-
wide pandemic; historic levels of sup-
port and investment in our Nation’s 
military and our men and women in 
uniform. 
And to try to put this all at the feet 
of President Biden’s Build Back Better 
agenda, a yet-unpassed reconciliation 
bill that is not the law—it hasn’t been 
passed—is ridiculous. We are talking 
about debt we already incurred, not 
spending in the future. 
And as my Republican colleagues 
know, we expect to fully pay for those 
investments. They may not like how 
we are going to offset the spending, but 
that is what the legislative process is 
for, to debate them. At least we are 
willing to pay for the bills we incur, 
which is more than could be said for 
the Republicans when they pushed a 
massive tax cut for the wealthy that 
was not paid for. 
So 
let’s 
stop 
this 
political 
brinksmanship. Let’s secure the full 
faith and credit of the United States. 
Let’s pass and increase the debt limit. 
To do otherwise puts our country and 
our economy at risk. 
The substitute also scales back the 
assistance provided to Afghan refugees 
that was included in the House-passed 
bill. 
Now, I was pleased when we reached 
bipartisan and bicameral agreement of 
$6.3 billion in the House-passed bill for 
much needed assistance for the brave 
Afghans who supported our mission 
through two decades of war. It is our 
duty; it is our obligation to support 
them. 
But the substitute bill they are seek-
ing to pass would shorten the length of 
time we provide assistance to thou-
sands of Afghan women and men who 
fled to the United States to escape the 
wrath of the Taliban—food, medical 
care, housing, basic things they need. 
The bill also eliminates their right to 
obtain a REAL ID-compliant U.S. driv-
er’s license, yet we want them to go 
out and seek jobs. 
How are they going to do that if they 
can’t drive? 
There shouldn’t even be a debate. I 
could give a dozen more reasons, but I 
know people are ready to vote, so I ob-
ject.

tion is heard.

NOT VOTING—2

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HEINRICH). On this vote, the yeas are 
48, the nays are 50. 
Three-fifths of the Senators duly cho-
sen and sworn not having voted in the 
affirmative, the motion is not agreed 
to. 
The motion was rejected. 
MOTION TO RECONSIDER 
Mr. SCHUMER. I enter a motion to 
reconsider the failed cloture vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is entered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, I 
want to make sure everyone under-
stands exactly what has happened here 
on the Senate floor. The Republican 
Party has now become the party of de-
fault, the party that says America 
doesn’t pay its debts. 
Our country is staring down the bar-
rel of two totally Republican-manufac-
tured disasters—a government shut-
down and a first-ever default on the na-
tional debt. The impacts of both would 
gravely harm every single American in 
this country. Republicans would let the 
country default for the first time in 
history. 
A few moments ago, the Senate had 
an opportunity to begin solving these 
problems right away. Democrats did 
their part and voted yes, but Senate 
Republicans meanwhile voted to drive 
our country straight toward a govern-
ment shutdown and the first default in 
our country’s history. 
Let me be clear. What the Repub-
licans in the Senate did tonight is not 
normal. This isn’t your typical Wash-
ington practice, and it shouldn’t be 
treated as such. It has far more severe 
consequences than the typical political 
cat fight. Republicans know the con-
sequences of their obstruction. They 
know a default would likely create a 
recession. They know that middle-class 
families will suffer immensely. They 
have heard the same warnings that we 
have. And by many calculations, the 
Republican default will raise the def-
icit by more than the American Rescue 
Plan, and yet Republicans still ob-
structed tonight. 
It is one of the most reckless, one of 
the most irresponsible votes I have 
seen take place in the Senate, and it 
should send a signal to every family, 
small business, market watcher about 
who in this Chamber is in favor of en-
dangering the economic stability of our 
country and who isn’t. 
Let me repeat: The Republican Party 
has solidified itself as the party of de-
fault, and it will be the American peo-
ple who pay the price. Social Security 
checks, Medicare benefits, veterans 
benefits, small business—all this and 
more are now on the chopping block 
because Senate Republicans are play-
ing games with the full faith and credit 
of the United States. 
Now, 
despite 
Republican 
intran-
sigence, this matter cannot be set aside 
for even a moment. Before the vote, I 
changed my vote from yes to no in 
order to reserve the option on addi-
tional action on the House-passed leg-
islation. 
Keeping the government open and 
preventing a default is vital to our 
country’s future, and we will be taking 
further action to prevent this from 
happening this week.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO ATOMIC VETERANS 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I draw at-
tention to and recognize the immense 
service and commitment to our coun-
try of our Nation’s Atomic Veterans. I 
also extend special recognition and 
gratitude to Idahoan and Atomic Vet-
eran Noelan ‘‘Mac’’ McCormack for his 
service to our country and his efforts 
to ensure his fellow veterans receive 
appreciation and recognition for their 
service and sacrifices. 
Mac McCormack of Coeur d’Alene, 
ID, served in the U.S. Marine Corps 
Test Unit #1, a unit active from 1954– 
1957 involved in specialized tactics, in-
cluding warfare as it related to nuclear 
weapons. An Atomic Veteran is a vet-
eran who, as part of his or her military 
service, participated in nuclear testing 
between 1945 and 1962, served in the 
U.S. military forces in or around Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki through mid-1946, 
or was held a prisoner of war in or near 
Hiroshima or Nagasaki. 
Earlier this year, when designating 
July 16, 2021, as National Atomic Vet-
erans Day, President Biden noted the 
considerable challenges Atomic Vet-
erans have faced, ‘‘Atomic Veterans

served our Nation with distinction, but 
their service came at a great cost. 
Many developed health conditions due 
to radiation exposure, yet because they 
were not able to discuss the nature of 
their service, they were unable to seek 
medical care or disability compensa-
tion from the Department of Veterans 
Affairs for their illnesses.’’ Decades 
after their service, in 1996, Congress re-
pealed the Nuclear Radiation and Se-
crecy Agreement Act, which enabled 
Atomic Veterans to seek services and 
share their experiences. The U.S. De-
partment of Veterans Affairs provides 
information to connect Atomic Vet-
erans with medical services and com-
pensation. However, the National Asso-
ciation of Atomic Veterans, Inc., notes, 
‘‘Currently, there are approximately 
195,000 Atomic Veterans across Amer-
ica who either do not know their oath- 
of-secrecy has been rescinded, and who 
are not aware of the potential mone-
tary benefits due them for (service con-
nected) radiation induced illnesses.’’ 
While the best healthcare and other 
services in the world can never reverse 
what many Atomic Veterans and their 
families have endured, we owe it to 
America’s servicemembers who have 
answered the call to duty to ensure ac-
cess to high-quality services and re-
sources to support their commitment 
to our country. As part of this effort, I 
cosponsored S.565, the Mark Takai 
Atomic Veterans Healthcare Parity 
Act, which would reclassify veterans 
who participated in the cleanup of the 
Enewetak Atoll as radiation-exposed 
veterans, making them eligible for the 
same benefits afforded to those covered 
by Radiation Exposure Compensation 
Act, RECA. Work also continues on bi-
partisan legislation to extend and ex-
pand RECA eligibility to those in Idaho 
and other States who have suffered 
from cancers related to fallout from 
nuclear weapons testing during the 
Cold War period of the 1950s and 1960s. 
As work continues on these and other 
efforts to support veterans, I join in 
honoring Atomic Veterans whose serv-
ice has been a central part of our na-
tional defense. I hope recognition can 
also draw attention to available serv-
ices and resources for Atomic Vet-
erans. 
In 
1983, 
then-President 
Ronald 
Reagan urged fellow citizens to join 
him in appreciation of the service of 
Atomic Veterans he characterized as, 
‘‘those 
patriotic 
Americans 
who 
through their participation in these 
tests helped lead the United States to 
the forefront of technology in defense 
of our great Nation and the freedoms 
we as Americans hold so dear.’’ 
Thank you, Mac McCormack, and 
your fellow Atomic Veterans, for your 
immeasurable 
and 
in 
many 
ways 
unrepayable service. I hope you know 
how deeply grateful we as a nation are 
for your patriotism. 
TRIBUTE TO FATHER GEORGE 
POULOS 
∑ Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize the Very Rev-
erend Father George Poulos, a deeply 
admired community leader, who turns 
100 on September 30. 
Born in Massachusetts to Greek im-
migrants in 1921, Father George joined 
the priesthood in 1943. He began his 
studies in Connecticut at the Holy 
Cross Seminary in Pomfret. Upon grad-
uating in 1948 from the Holy Cross 
Seminary in Brookline, MA, Father 
George served as a pastor of the Holy 
Trinity Church in Norwich, CT. Then, 
in 1956, he was assigned to the Church 
of the Archangels in Stamford, CT. In 
2009, after over six decades of remark-
able service, Father George retired. He 
still plays an active role at the Church 
of the Archangels, serving as pastor 
emeritus. 
I have been privileged to know Fa-
ther George as a leader of courage and 
conviction, 
whose 
great 
work 
has 
touched countless lives. His vision and 
dedication enabled the Church of the 
Archangels to build an amazing, 11th 
Century Byzantine-style Greek Ortho-
dox Church, which was consecrated in 
1959. Later, in 1976, the church campus 
opened the Greek Cultural Center, 
which offered athletic amenities for 
church youth and banquet facilities for 
the entire community. In 1995, this 
center became the Stamford Athletic 
Club, providing invaluable services to 
the public. 
Father George oversaw the creation 
of Ionian Village, a summer camp 
youth program in Greece. Since 1970, it 
has hosted thousands of Greek-Amer-
ican campers, giving them the oppor-
tunity to further explore their cultural 
history, religious roots, and language. 
Father George also established ‘‘Byzan-
tine Fellowship’’ in America, and in his 
30-year tenure as executive director, 
helped sponsor Greek cultural events 
in the United States and pilgrimages. 
Father George’s tireless dedication 
to helping others has earned him enor-
mous respect and affection, as well as 
official recognition. He was appointed 
as vicar general of the churches in Con-
necticut by the Greek Orthodox Arch-
diocese, and in 2017, he received an hon-
orary doctorate of divinity from Holy 
Cross Seminary. Father George is a 
prolific author and is actively involved 
in community service, as chaplain of 
the Stamford Fire Department, vice 
president 
of 
the 
local 
Council 
of 
Churches and Synagogues, and a major 
in the U.S. Air Force Civil Patrol. 
I am honored to know Father George 
and his family for many years—indeed, 
decades. I can attest firsthand to his 
wonderful generosity and loyalty as a 
friend and his love for humanity, as 
well as the warm and welcoming spirit 
of his congregants. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in congratulating 
the Very Reverend Father George 
Poulos, his wife, Christine, their five 
sons, and their six grandchildren on 
this milestone of Father George’s 100th 
birthday.∑ 
ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING 
THE 
WALT 
WHIT-
MAN HIGH SCHOOL CLASS OF 
1970 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, on 
Saturday, October 9, 2021, nearly 200 
members of the class of 1970 of Walt 
Whitman High School in Bethesda, MD, 
will hold their 50th class reunion, an 
event delayed a year by the COVID–19 
pandemic. It is my pleasure to con-
gratulate them on this special occa-
sion. 
This distinguished class of 1970 from 
Walt Whitman has an exemplary his-
tory of contributions to society and to 
advancing social justice. As children, a 
number of class members from the 
Bannockburn 
neighborhood 
in 
Be-
thesda joined a contingent from How-
ard University for the first multiracial 
civil rights protest in America, pick-
eting segregated Glen Echo Amuse-
ment Park daily for 22 weeks in 1960 
after Blacks were arrested for riding 
its carousel. As the result of these and 
other efforts, the policy was changed, 
and the park reopened to all the next 
year. And this year, those members of 
the class of 1970 will return to Glen 
Echo during their 50th reunion to ride 
that same carousel on its 100th anni-
versary. 
The class of 1970 came of age at an 
important time in our Nation’s his-
tory, a period of great change and dra-
matic events. When they were 8 years 
old in 1961, they saw President John F. 
Kennedy call for all citizens to commit 
to work for the common good. They 
saw the beginning of space exploration, 
the Cuban Missile Crisis, the arrival of 
the Beatles, the passage by the U.S. 
Congress of landmark bills on voting 
rights and fair housing, the Vietnam 
war, and the tragedies of the assassina-
tions of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
and Senator Robert Kennedy. 
This social awareness led to lifelong 
commitment and activism for so many 
in this remarkable class. In protest of 
the Vietnam war, many participated in 
the National Moratorium Against the 
War. In the dramatic March Against 
Death, dozens of members of the class 
carried the names of fallen soldiers 
whose families could not travel here to 
join the protest. As the first class of 
students subject to a draft lottery con-
ducted by the Selective Service Sys-
tem, many classmates participated in 
efforts to abolish military conscription 
in the U.S. and in support of lowering 
the voting age from 21 to 18. 
In 1970, when members of this class 
were in their senior year, WWHS was 
named the No. 1 public high school in 
the Nation by ‘‘U.S. News & World Re-
port,’’ which also recently named Whit-
man the best high school in Maryland. 
Whitman’s first principal, Dr. Daryl 
Shaw, called the class of 1970 ‘‘the most 
challenging’’ he ever had, in light of 
their frequent questioning of authority 
and 
vigorous 
advocacy 
for 
social 
change. Profound events that changed

the Nation happened during their high 
school years. The first moon landing 
and Woodstock happened only 27 days 
apart. And just 5 weeks before gradua-
tion, in a reflection of the profound 
tension in our Nation, 13 unarmed stu-
dents were shot at Kent State, four fa-
tally. 
Some in their generation warned, 
‘‘Don’t trust anyone over 30.’’ Now, as 
the class of 1970 approaches 70, its 
members can look back on 50 years of 
lives well lived. This class can boast of 
significant achievement, as its mem-
bers include, among many other grad-
uates of great distinction, elected offi-
cials, physicians, lawyers, real estate 
developers, orchestra conductors, musi-
cians, magazine publishers, and at 
least one juggler. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
sending our very best wishes and con-
gratulations to the Walt Whitman High 
School class of 1970 as its members 
gather—1 year late—for their 50th re-
union.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO STEPHANIE BARNA  
∑ Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my 
honor to pay tribute to Stephanie 
Barna, who is retiring October 15 after 
more than 30 years of Federal service. 
A dedicated public servant, a fierce ad-
vocate for our Nation’s men and 
women in uniform, and an astute legal 
mind, the Senate Committee on Armed 
Services has been extremely fortunate 
to have Ms. Barna as Republican Gen-
eral Counsel for the past 3 years. 
Ms. Barna joined the Committee on 
Armed Services in November 2018, after 
decades of working within the Depart-
ment of Defense both as a uniformed 
officer and as a civilian. As a career 
Senior Executive at the Pentagon, Ms. 
Barna held critical positions that fo-
cused on Total Force management, per-
sonnel matters, and improving the 
lives of our servicemembers and their 
families. Most recently, she performed 
the duties of the Under Secretary of 
Defense for Secretary of Defense Jim 
Mattis. Before that, she served as sen-
ior policy adviser to then-Under Sec-
retary of Defense Robert Wilkie; Prin-
cipal Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Manpower and Reserve Af-
fairs; performed the duties of Principal 
Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for 
Personnel and Readiness; and Deputy 
General Counsel for Operations and 
Personnel in the Office of the Army 
General Counsel. 
Ms. Barna began her public service 
career in 1989 as a lieutenant in the 
U.S. Army Judge Advocate General’s 
Corps. Ultimately, she retired from the 
U.S. Army Reserve in 2011 in the grade 
of colonel. She is also qualified as an 
Army Jumpmaster, and if she is willing 
to jump out of a perfectly safe plane, 
she is definitely able to work in Con-
gress. 
As a member of my staff on the Sen-
ate Committee on Armed Services, Ms. 
Barna played a critical role in the 
drafting and enactment of the fiscal 
year 2020 and 2021 National Defense Au-
thorization Acts, NDAA. Because of 
her work and commitment to bipar-
tisan solutions, we successfully en-
acted the 59th and 60th consecutive 
NDAAs 
when 
many 
speculated 
it 
couldn’t be done. I am grateful for her 
work this year to help usher the fiscal 
year 2022 NDAA toward the finish line 
as well. With creativity and tenacity, 
Ms. Barna shepherded important policy 
reforms that strengthened national se-
curity, improved the management of 
the Pentagon, and bettered the lives of 
our servicemembers. 
Over her career, Ms. Barna received 
numerous, well-deserved accolades, in-
cluding the Legion of Merit, the Meri-
torious Executive Presidential Rank 
Award, the Department of Defense 
Medal for Distinguished Civilian Serv-
ice, and the Department of the Army 
Exceptional Civilian Service Award— 
twice. 
Most telling to her leadership, Ms. 
Barna has never asked for recognition. 
She is a tireless worker, wholly dedi-
cated to serving her Nation. If you 
were to look up the definitions of 
‘‘competent,’’ ‘‘capable,’’ and ‘‘grace 
under fire’’ in the dictionary, I am sure 
you would see her picture. 
Ms. Barna leaves behind a legacy of 
getting things done, of doing what is 
good and right, and fulfilling the law to 
the best of her understanding. Because 
of her, the Department of Defense oper-
ates better, our troops are better cared 
for, and long-standing institution of 
the U.S. Senate live on. While she will 
leave big shoes to fill on the Senate 
Committee on Armed Services, I wish 
her very well in her well-earned retire-
ment. For her service, she has my 
thanks and the thanks of a grateful na-
tion.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO SUSAN MEUSCHKE 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today I am honored to recognize Susan 
Meuschke, executive director of the 
Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and 
Sexual Violence—NCEDSV—who will 
officially retire on September 30, 2021. 
Ms. Meuschke has been a champion 
for victims of domestic violence and 
their families for more than three dec-
ades. Her career in advocacy and 
awareness of the problem of family vio-
lence in our communities began when 
she was a volunteer for the Committee 
to Aid Abused Women in Reno, NV. It 
was there, while listening to the strug-
gles and the courage of those dealing 
with family violence, that she found 
her lifelong passion for helping those in 
need. Ms. Meuschke then went on to 
work with NCEDSV for 32 years and 
was instrumental in developing the or-
ganization into a powerful force in the 
State of Nevada with 10 full-time staff 
members, a variety of consultants, and 
offices in both Reno and Las Vegas. Ms. 
Meuschke is also a founding member of 
the Nevada Domestic Violence Preven-
tion Council and a former member of 
the National Coalition Against Domes-
tic Violence Steering Committee. In 
2019, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak 
proclaimed February 1 as a day in 
honor of Ms. Meuschke, a fitting trib-
ute for such a remarkable woman. 
It has been an honor to work with 
Ms. Meuschke to help grow domestic 
violence programs. While I was Ne-
vada’s attorney general, 
I 
worked 
closely with Ms. Meuschke to ensure 
we passed legislation to create dedi-
cated funding for domestic violence 
programs through fees on marriage li-
censes. Before her retirement, Ms. 
Meuschke and NCEDSV were also 
working on a bill to increase statewide 
funding for domestic violence services 
and to create funding for sexual vio-
lence services. These efforts reflect her 
dedication to working across the aisle 
to build a safer, more caring world for 
survivors of domestic and sexual vio-
lence. 
During 2020 and the height of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Ms. 
Meuschke 
worked hard to ensure that Federal 
coronavirus relief funding delivered to 
NCEDSV went to programs aimed at 
providing education and support to sur-
vivors in rural communities. The fund-
ing also sought to improve the finan-
cial independence of survivors through 
the Financial Empowerment Microloan 
program. Ms. Meuschke was crucial in 
seeing that the funds were distributed 
equitably to programs that would 
make the biggest difference in the lives 
of survivors. 
As Ms. Meuschke enters her retire-
ment, I want to make sure her decades 
of strong advocacy and empowerment 
are recognized for the important im-
pact they have had in the State of Ne-
vada. First as Nevada’s attorney gen-
eral and now as a U.S. Senator, I have 
been fortunate to work side-by-side 
with Ms. Meuschke to support families 
and 
make 
our 
communities 
safer. 
NCEDSV is not only a strong advocate 
for policies that protect victims but a 
resource for survivors who are looking 
for help. Much of its strength can be 
attributed to Ms. Meuschke’s leader-
ship and her unwavering resilience and 
fortitude to advocate on behalf of all 
survivors.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. TUBERVILLE: 
S. 2857. A bill to prohibit any Federal 
agency from requiring financial insti-
tutions to report on the financial 
transactions of their customers; to the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
you know, these days, information is 
only a few clicks away on your com-
puter, and there is more information to 
be consumed than there are hours in 
the day. It is information overload, and 
it is overwhelming to sift through all 
the noise. But no matter the narrative 
being pushed, one thing remains: the 
facts. The facts don’t lie. It is informa-
tion overload. 
The facts tell the story better than 
anyone. Facts take many forms and 
play out in many ways. They are the 
impacts of decisions made and actions 
taken, whether we like it or not. But it 
doesn’t take long for anyone to see this 
fact: The decisions coming out of the 
White House have followed one overall 
thought, one guiding ideology. It is not 
a unifying ideology that protects the 
freedoms and liberties we hold dear as 
Americans. It doesn’t safeguard the 
values of our country or promote a vi-
sion for a brighter tomorrow and a 
more prosperous nation for future gen-
erations. It is a Big Government, so-
cialist ideology. It is a vision of trans-
formation. It is a strategy of undoing 
everything done by the previous ad-
ministration even if those policies were 
successful. 
Since President Biden’s inaugura-
tion, every executive order, every regu-
latory rollback, and every message of 
so-called unity we were once promised 
has been in the spirit of doing the op-
posite of the previous administration, 
with an emphasis on the ‘‘woke’’ trans-
formation of America’s founding prin-
ciples. ‘‘But not Trump’’ is not a strat-
egy. It is not a policy stance. It is a re-
actionary and misguided posture that 
has plunged our Nation into domestic 
and international disarray. 
It is a backward approach to imple-
menting an agenda to transform the 
culture and the values of America, and 
we are seeing the on-the-ground effects 
of this approach in our communities, 
at our borders, and abroad. 
When the singular driving force of 
your Presidency is simply being the op-
posite of your predecessor, our country 
faces the consequences of that decision. 
We are facing crises that were prevent-
able, crises that are a direct result of 
policy decisions. This is an uncomfort-
able and inconvenient fact for Presi-
dent Biden, and Democrats don’t seem 
too interested in the facts about the 
consequences of this administration’s 
decision, either. 
So let me lay them out. Here are 
some facts. The Biden administration 
inherited 
a 
conditions-based 
with-
drawal strategy on Afghanistan. The 
idea was that we will have a with-
drawal of forces that kept some boots 
on the ground to maintain stability 
and limit chaos and, importantly, pre-
serve the progress our troops had 
made. Instead of continuing this condi-
tions-based approach that would pro-
tect our servicemembers, allies, and in-
nocent civilians, President Biden came 
up with a new plan, one he thought 
would make for better headlines, rath-
er than listening to our commanders 
on the ground. 
President Trump’s plan was to roll 
people out strategically and maintain 
our assets to prevent attacks on the 
United States in the future. The plan 
certainly did not involve leaving Amer-
ican citizens behind. Instead, President 
Biden’s decision left chaos in its wake. 
His decision left our troops vulnerable 
and resulted in the death of 13—13— 
U.S. servicemembers. The average age 
of these servicemembers was 22 years 
old.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6706 
September 27, 2021 
His decision has disrespected the sac-
rifices of more than 800,000 U.S. vet-
erans who bravely served during the 
War on Terror. His decision gave the 
Taliban their greatest victory to date 
and made them one of the top 10 most 
well-equipped militaries in the world, 
funded by the hard-working taxpayers 
of this country. His decision abandoned 
innocent Americans in a country gov-
erned by radical terrorists, and it is 
clear that he ignored the best military 
advice given to him by his top com-
manders and ordered our troops to put 
down their weapons and retreat. 
President Biden’s decision to with-
draw from Afghanistan this way gave 
the Taliban everything they wanted: 
control of the region, our own weapons, 
and, ultimately, a breeding ground for 
terrorism. The fact of the matter is, 
our country will be facing the con-
sequences of President Biden’s decision 
for decades—for decades to come. 
Our country was safer for the past 20 
years thanks to the bravest fighting 
forces in the world, our men and 
women in uniform. Counterterrorism is 
still necessary, but we just made it 
harder on ourselves by not having 
ground forces and by closing Bagram 
Airfield. 
The myth from the White House is 
that our country had no choice but 
that we were beholden to a deal made 
before January 20. But the policy deci-
sions 
made 
by 
President 
Biden 
emboldened the Taliban, endangered 
Americans, and encouraged our adver-
saries. 
Tomorrow, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee will hold the first open 
hearing—hopefully, one of many—to 
review President Biden’s decision and 
what caused our time in Afghanistan 
to conclude the way it did. The Amer-
ican people deserve facts, and I and the 
rest of our delegation will not rest 
until we have answers from the people 
involved. 
From abroad to right here at our own 
southwest border, we are witnessing 
the disastrous effects of the Biden 
Presidency play out in epic propor-
tions. The numbers do not lie. 
Fact: In July and August, apprehen-
sions at the southern border surpassed 
200,000 each month. That is quadruple 
the amount from this time last year. 
Fact: We have seen recordbreaking 
numbers of illegal immigrants at our 
southwest border from the day Presi-
dent Biden was inaugurated. Over 1.3 
million people have been apprehended 
trying to illegally cross our southwest 
border, and that is only the ones we 
know of. There are hundreds of thou-
sands more getting into our country. 
And fact: All of this is a direct result 
of President Biden’s open border poli-
cies, a reversal from those of the pre-
vious administration. 
This is a prime example of the Biden 
administration putting politics over 
policy. On January 20, his first day in 
office, President Biden announced a 
suspension of the border wall construc-
tion. Now billions of taxpayer dollars 
are being spent to cover the cost of 
canceling the contracts the Federal 
Government entered into to build the 
wall. On the same day, he terminated 
the Migrant Protection Protocols pol-
icy. 
In February, President Biden termi-
nated the asylum cooperative agree-
ments with the Northern Triangle 
countries established under President 
Trump. Doing away with these agree-
ments has allowed caravans to travel 
thousands of miles through multiple 
countries to our southwest border, 
without any capacity support from our 
regional partners. 
These decisions have directly con-
tributed to the unprecedented numbers 
of illegal immigrant encounters we 
have seen, because with these deci-
sions, President Biden signaled to the 
world that anyone wanting to leave 
their country for ours would be admit-
ted to the United States of America. 
After months of avoiding the word 
‘‘crisis’’ to describe the border, Presi-
dent Biden recently said: ‘‘We will get 
the border under control.’’ To even say 
he will ‘‘get the border under control’’ 
means he acknowledges that it is not 
under control. 
Well, I guess that is one fact that we 
can all come to agreement on. 
The facts that Democrats seem to 
want to ignore most are those that 
deal with our economy. The separation 
from fact to fiction for our friends 
across the aisle could not be starker 
than when it comes to the American 
economy. 
It is a fact that inflation is sky 
high—as high as it has been since 2010. 
Despite rising inflation and increasing 
prices, the President is still marching 
forward with his vision of Big Govern-
ment—a big government welfare State, 
enacted through the Democrats’ reck-
less tax-and-spend spree. He wants to 
create a massive welfare State paid for 
by staggering—and I mean staggering— 
tax hikes that would destroy economic 
growth. 
And the Democrats are his captive 
audience. President Biden’s America is 
one where our businesses and job cre-
ators pay for all. That is not ‘‘pay your 
fair share.’’ That is wealth distribu-
tion. 
He is not interested in boosting the 
economy and helping Americans. He is 
interested in remaking the system 
with subsidies and entitlements—a wel-
fare state to keep everyone beholden to 
the 
government—no 
work 
require-
ments, just complete government de-
pendency. 
Our country was founded on freedom. 
It was founded on opportunity—the op-
portunity to work hard and to achieve 
the American dream. That is what this 
country owes you, not a handout but a 
hand up. 
The programs laid out in the Demo-
crats’ reckless tax-and-spend spree are 
a transparent effort to a woke trans-
formation of the values and culture 
upon which our country was built. If 
that wasn’t bad enough, they are going 
to raise taxes to pay for them, picking 
from a menu of more than 30 new 
taxes. 
Our businesses, small and large, cre-
ate jobs and grow the economy. In-
creasing their taxes means they can’t 
spend and invest in their own busi-
nesses. If they can’t expand, they can’t 
create more jobs. In fact, it is quite the 
opposite. Businesses will squeeze in-
ward, cutting workers and wages. 
A higher corporate tax rate isn’t 
‘‘paying their fair share.’’ It is destroy-
ing the blue-collar jobs that have 
fueled the middle class. 
Why would we ever take pride in the 
fact that our corporate tax rate is 
higher than China’s? When did that be-
come a worthy goal? 
I have an answer for you: It is not. 
But the terrible proposals to offset the 
cost of this bill just keep on coming. 
The Biden administration wants to 
require financial institutions to report 
account 
balances 
and 
transactions 
greater than $600 made by Americans 
to the IRS, the Internal Revenue Serv-
ice. Any transaction you make over 
$600 will be reported to the IRS. That is 
every taxpayer in this country. Today, 
only transactions over $10,000, which is 
a lot of money, are reported. 
Yes, that is the same Agency with a 
long history of data security failures. 
Earlier this year, the confidential tax 
information of a number of prominent 
Americans 
leaked—surprisingly, 
leaked—from the IRS and was pub-
lished in the press. 
The Agency also has a history of sin-
gling out certain taxpayers for polit-
ical purposes. You have a rent payment 
over $600, planning to buy airplane 
tickets over $600—how about a new 
hunting rifle? a wedding dress for your 
daughter? All of this—any transaction 
over $600—would be sent to the IRS 
under President Biden’s plan. This is 
Big Brother Government at its worst. 
We are talking about routine finan-
cial transactions that Americans make 
every day. The IRS has no business 
monitoring these—none. The IRS is in-
trusive enough as it is. This is some-
thing Americans of all political stripes 
should agree on. 
Not only would the IRS be looking 
over Americans’ shoulders, but this 
would place a heavy burden on commu-
nity banks and credit unions that play 
a key role in providing financial serv-
ices to rural and minority commu-
nities. These financial institutions can-
not afford to monitor and report all 
this data to the IRS. They can’t afford 
it. It will put many of these folks out 
of business, destroying mainstream 
American communities that rely on all 
of them in the process. 
But don’t just take my word for it. 
The Independent Community Bankers 
of America’s Minority Bank Advisory 
Council wrote: 
Our primary concern is that the proposal 
would undermine the critical relationship of 
trust we foster within the communities we 
serve—communities prone to distrust of in-
stitutions and government agencies. We fear

that invasive and indiscriminate account re-
porting would undermine the policy priority 
of bringing more people into the banking 
system and may drive many of those in the 
system to leave. 
I couldn’t have said it better. 
This is one of the most outrageous 
proposals coming from this administra-
tion—and there have been a lot of them 
over the last 9 months. This is like a 
shakedown squad coming around to try 
to get every single cent from you that 
they can. 
So, today, I introduced a bill called 
the Protecting Financial Privacy Act 
that would proactively prohibit this. 
My bill prohibits any Federal Agency 
from creating, implementing, or ad-
ministering a financial account infor-
mation reporting regime that would re-
quire financial institutions or individ-
uals to report data on financial trans-
actions or account balances to the IRS 
in excess of what is already required by 
the Bank Secrecy Act. The last thing 
Americans want or need is Big Brother 
looking over their shoulders. 
The President wants to run from the 
facts. He would rather hide behind 
them and point fingers. The facts, for 
him, don’t fit. But it is time for the 
President to wake up. It is time to stop 
blaming President Trump for disasters 
that are clearly his own making. It is 
time to stop an entitlement state of 
our country that Americans don’t 
want. It is time for the President to 
face the facts and listen to the Amer-
ican people. He cannot be allowed to 
deflect responsibility and attempt to 
distract the American people from cri-
ses that were predictable and prevent-
able, especially when the facts couldn’t 
be clearer.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 387—RECOG-
NIZING THE 60TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE PEACE CORPS AND COM-
MENDING 
THE 
VOLUNTEERS 
WHO 
HAVE 
DEDICATED 
THEIR 
LIVES 
TO 
MAKING 
A 
DIF-
FERENCE IN THE WORLD 
Mr. MENENDEZ submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions: 
S. RES. 387 
Whereas the Peace Corps Act of 1961 was 
signed into law by President John F. Ken-
nedy on September 22, 1961; 
Whereas the Peace Corps’ mission is to 
promote world peace and friendship by— 
(1) helping the people in interested coun-
tries to meet their need for trained workers; 
(2) helping to promote a better under-
standing of Americans by people in countries 
where volunteers have served; and 
(3) helping to promote a better under-
standing of such people by Americans; 
Whereas Peace Corps volunteers work to 
advance both international development and 
public diplomacy, with more than 240,000 
Americans who have answered the call to 
service by cumulatively serving in 142 coun-
tries and providing more than 3,000,000,000 of 
service to our Nation and the world; 
Whereas Peace Corps volunteers exemplify 
American values and grow trust and faith in 
the United States in developing countries 
by— 
(1) building connections with the people 
with whom they live and work; and 
(2) helping communities realize the full po-
tential of their present assets and discover 
new opportunities; 
Whereas returned Peace Corps volunteers 
enter the job market with— 
(1) the experience of working with limited 
resources and navigating bureaucratic insti-
tutions; and 
(2) proficiency in many languages and com-
munication styles; 
(3) passion about mission-driven work; and 
(4) the ability to invest in their commu-
nities in a lasting way; 
Whereas due to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the Peace Corps made the difficult decision, 
in early 2020, to temporarily suspend all vol-
unteer missions and recall approximately 
7,300 volunteers and trainees from their 
countries of service; 
Whereas the Peace Corps and the broader 
Peace Corps community have utilized this 
temporary recall to deeply explore how the 
many ways in which the Peace Corps could 
be improved in its support of volunteers and 
its collaboration with the communities in 
which such volunteers are serving, including 
facilitating COVID–19 testing and the dis-
tribution of COVID–19 vaccines; 
Whereas beginning in December 2021, the 
Peace Corps will gradually resume its volun-
teer missions abroad, beginning with mis-
sions located in parts of Latin America and 
the Caribbean. 
Whereas Peace Corps volunteers play a sig-
nificant role in implementing presidential 
initiatives at the local level, including train-
ing and deploying more than 800 specialized 
malaria prevention volunteers to serve in 
communities across Africa since 2011; 
Whereas the Peace Corps, in partnership 
with the United States Agency for Inter-
national Development, has generated an ad-
ditional $34,000,000 in local community and 
third party contributions through the Small 
Project Assistance Program in support of 
important development outcomes, includ-
ing— 
(1) efforts to combat human trafficking; 
(2) enhanced civic engagement and public 
accountability; 
(3) 
improved 
maternal 
and 
children’s 
health outcomes; 
(4) preventing the spread of malaria; 
(5) bolstered community resilience and pre-
paredness to environmental disasters; 
Whereas 42 percent of Peace Corps volun-
teers work in the education sector by— 
(1) increasing the English language com-
petency of local students and teachers; 
(2) developing teaching materials and im-
proving the teaching techniques of local 
teachers; or 
(3) assisting after-school programs, youth 
clubs, and the development of libraries; 
Whereas the Peace Corps advances the 
principles of gender equality worldwide and 
maintains a volunteer force that is 65 per-
cent female; and 
Whereas the Peace Corps is integral to re-
alizing United States’ foreign policy, ad-
dressing critical global challenges that re-
quire United States’ leadership, and ad-
vances our United States’ national security 
interests: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the 
Peace Corps; 
(2) honors all of the volunteers who have 
dedicated their lives to address the serious 
global challenges of our time, including illit-
eracy, environmental degradation, food inse-
curity, and communicable diseases; 
(3) commends the tireless service of the 
civil servants, recruiters, medical and secu-
rity personnel, and in-country support staff 
that run the Peace Corps on a daily basis; 
and 
(4) renews the United States’ commit-
ment— 
(A) to promoting world peace and friend-
ship; and 
(B) to helping developing countries reach 
their development goals.

EXTENDING GOVERNMENT FUND-
ING 
AND 
DELIVERING 
EMER-
GENCY ASSISTANCE ACT 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I 
want to talk about transparency, and I 
want to talk about the need for trans-
parency here in the U.S. Senate more 
than ever. 
The House and the Senate are mov-
ing with breakneck speed to pass one of 
the biggest, most reckless spending so-
cial bills in U.S. history, over $31⁄2 tril-
lion—a spending spree that will be the 
largest in a generation—which will in-
clude the largest tax hike that we have 
seen in peacetime and something that 
the majority leader himself has called 
the largest transformation in a genera-
tion. 
Make no mistake. This is trying to 
transform America—cradle to grave so-
cialism. Don’t take my word for it. 
Here is the way the New York Times 
described this $31⁄2
trillion reckless 
spending bill from the House coming to 
the Senate. It is legislation that would 
touch virtually every American’s life 
from conception to age and infirmity, 
from cradle to grave. That is the New 
York Times. In other words, the Fed-
eral Government will be involved in all 
facets of every single American life, 
from birth to death—one of the biggest

September 27, 2021 
tax-and-spend programs certainly since 
President Johnson’s Great Society or 
President Roosevelt’s New Deal. 
With that involvement of our govern-
ment will come higher taxes, taxes on 
smaller businesses, taxes on the middle 
class, and, yes, we believe our Senate 
colleagues are planning a tax cut for 
those who live in the big cities, known 
as the ‘‘Blue State Bailout.’’ The chair-
man of the Budget Committee, who is 
crafting this bill, Senator SANDERS, 
who has called himself ‘‘a proud social-
ist,’’ is going to have tax cuts for mil-
lionaires and billionaires in this legis-
lation. 
So one would think that a bill of this 
magnitude, 
this 
size, 
this 
trans-
formational an impact on every single 
American, would be a bill that the U.S. 
Senate, the so-called most deliberative 
body in the world, would actually hold 
one hearing on—just one—and would 
actually hold a markup or two in the 
different committees. Right now, our 
Democratic colleagues, with no expla-
nation, are not planning on one hear-
ing or one markup in any committee— 
none. As, I think, anybody who knows 
anything about this body knows, that 
is unprecedented. 
The House rushed, no doubt. They 
have already marked up this legisla-
tion, way too fast, but, at least, they 
allowed for amendments. At least, they 
debated it. 
When 
Republicans 
controlled 
the 
Congress in 2017, with regard to the 
2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which went 
through reconciliation, we held numer-
ous hearings in Senate committees. We 
had markups. We debated amendments. 
But for this bill—31⁄2
trillion—right 
now, our colleagues are not going to do 
any of that. 
Of course, the media has given them 
a free pass. Nothing. The most delib-
erative body in the world, the trans-
formational bill of a generation, the 
Green New Deal and all the other so-
cialist ideas, and we are not going to 
have one hearing, not going to have 
one markup in one committee. 
What is going on? Well, I would love 
it if the majority leader or any other 
Senate Democrat would come down to 
the Senate floor and explain to the 
American people why. Why aren’t we 
doing that? No transparency? 
So I have a theory, because we are 
not going to hear from the majority 
leader or any of my other colleagues. I 
would love to hear them. 
Come on down. Explain why we are 
not having one hearing on the biggest 
bill in a generation—31⁄2 trillion. 
Here is my theory. There are several 
reasons why they don’t want the public 
to see a hearing or a markup relating 
to this bill. 
First and foremost, they don’t want 
to have to defend what is in it. They 
don’t want the public, who is seeing 
skyrocketing prices at the pump, at 
the grocery store, seeing all the in-
creases in prices across our country, to 
see the specifics of a bill that are clear-
ly going to supercharge more inflation. 
They don’t want to have to defend a 
bill that will have the largest tax in-
crease in American history. They don’t 
want to have to defend a bill or show 
the American people tax rates on small 
businesses that will be bigger than 
anything in the European Union or in 
communist China, or hundreds of bil-
lions to bail out health insurers or $200 
million for the Speaker’s pet project in 
the Presidio Park in San Francisco or 
$5 billion for an environmental justice 
tax credit for universities, whatever 
the heck that is. Or how about $100 bil-
lion for amnesty for 10 million illegal 
immigrants, making them eligible for 
Federal benefits? They don’t want to 
have to defend that. They don’t want 
to have to debate that. These are just 
a few core elements of the bill as we 
know it. As I mentioned, there are also 
the tax cuts for millionaires and bil-
lionaires in big cities. 
And they don’t want to have to talk 
about the debt ceiling that my col-
leagues are trying to raise so they can 
continue their trillion dollars of reck-
less spending. The majority leader just 
mentioned that. He doesn’t mention 
what is in the bill, won’t have hearings 
about what is in the bill, won’t have 
markups for the American people to 
see. 
And on the debt ceiling, you know, 
just last month, 45 of my Senate Re-
publican colleagues and I signed a let-
ter, putting our colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle on notice that we will 
not vote to increase the debt limit if 
they continued down this reckless 
path. And the reason is simple: My 
Democratic colleagues are content to 
go it alone and pass their irresponsible 
$31⁄2
trillion socialist spending spree 
with no hearings, no markup, no noth-
ing, with just Democratic input, which 
is all we have. 
Again, when we were going through 
our budget reconciliation process, we 
took amendments, we debated them, 
and we voted on them. They are not 
doing that. 
If they are doing this solely by them-
selves, with no transparency, then our 
Democratic friends should be solely re-
sponsible for raising the debt ceiling to 
accommodate 
it. 
They 
control 
all 
branches of the government. The ma-
jority leader clearly knows they could 
fix that right now. They are creating 
their own crisis, and they can solve it. 
So, once again, this $31⁄2 trillion bill 
is being rushed. What is another rea-
son? I think they are getting a little 
nervous that if you had a markup, say, 
in the Budget Committee, you would 
see that the author of the bill, the 
chairman of the Budget Committee, is 
promoting a socialist agenda that he is 
proud of because he is actually an 
avowed socialist. 
Now, I am not trying to insult any-
one. This is what he calls himself. 
So I think my Democratic colleagues 
get a little nervous that a bill authored 
by a socialist in the Senate would have 
to be defended. But, again, no hearings, 
no markup, and I know a lot of my 
Democratic colleagues are uncomfort-
able with this. They are uncomfortable 
with the bill. They are uncomfortable 
with the lack of transparency, but they 
are not calling for transparency. They 
are saying: Let’s just move this as 
quickly as possible so nobody in Amer-
ica can see it. 
So far, they are being successful, but 
I think we need to put this into con-
text. Here is a piece from the Wall 
Street Journal from last week, where 
it talked about putting this rush job on 
the reckless spending bill from the ma-
jority leader and the Speaker of the 
House in historic context. It said: 
FDR’s New Deal programs were passed in-
crementally over two Presidential terms 
with overwhelming Democratic majorities. 
Democrats created the Great Society over 
two years, with supermajorities under Presi-
dent Johnson. ObamaCare was hashed out 
over nine months before Democrats enacted 
it into law with 56 votes in the Senate. The 
2017 GOP tax reform bill— 
as I just mentioned— 
was debated for months, and its principles 
for years before Congress voted and marked 
it up. 
Now with merely 50 Democrats in the Sen-
ate— 
fifty-fifty here— 
and a five-Member House majority, Demo-
crats are planning to rush through the big-
gest tax and spending increase in half a cen-
tury— 
With not one hearing in the U.S. Sen-
ate, without one markup in any com-
mittee. 
There is no mandate for this, but for 
most of my colleagues, the quicker the 
better to move on. Don’t look, Amer-
ica. Don’t look that the author of this 
bill is actually a socialist, because it is 
socialism. 
Now, this rush job is not good for the 
American people. So here is a better 
idea, and it comes from a Senate Dem-
ocrat, my colleague Senator MANCHIN. 
A couple of weeks ago, he very wisely 
called for a ‘‘strategic pause.’’ 
In an op-ed in the Wall Street Jour-
nal he said that there is another reason 
for a strategic pause. 
Now I am quoting Senator MANCHIN: 
We must allow for a complete reporting 
and analysis of the implications a multitril-
lion-dollar bill will have for this generation 
and the next. Such a strategic pause will 
allow every member of Congress to use the 
transparent committee process to debate: 
What should we fund, and what can we sim-
ply not afford? 
That is Senator MANCHIN. His op-ed 
also said that amid the inflation that 
we are seeing, debt and the inevi-
tability of future crises, Congress needs 
to take a strategic pause on this $31⁄2 
trillion reckless spending spree. 
So one of my Democratic colleagues 
is wisely calling for what we all know 
we need here, which is the precedent of 
this body, the most deliberative body 
in the world—a pause, hearings, mark-
ups so the American people can see 
what is actually in this. 
It sounds like that is not going to 
happen, and I would love it if any of 
my Democratic colleagues would come

to the floor and tell the American peo-
ple why. 
We can and should have debates 
about our respective visions for our 
great country. 
No one should be afraid of looking 
closely at this $31⁄2
trillion mon-
strosity. Let’s have a debate about it. 
Let’s debate the massive increases in 
taxes, the vast expansion of entitle-
ments, the cradle-to-grave socialism 
that certain Democrats are proposing 
for every individual American’s life. 
The American people deserve this. 
My constituents back home in Alaska 
certainly would welcome such a debate, 
but the American people deserve this. 
Why are my colleagues afraid to de-
bate and have hearings and a markup 
on this massive legislation? It is the 
American people’s money, after all, 
that will pay for this transformational, 
socialist bill, and it is their lives that 
will be impacted and upended if this 
reckless, rushed bill becomes law. 
So let’s do this. Let’s hit a strategic 
pause, as Senator MANCHIN asked for. 
Let’s pry this bill open, hold hear-
ings, and lay out our visions for our 
country. Let’s have a debate: More 
taxes or freedom? Socialism versus 
market capitalism. Do we want a fun-
damental transformation, as the ma-
jority leader and the budget chairman 
have asked for, or do we want common-
sense legislation that helps working 
men and women in our country achieve 
their dreams? 
I am hopeful that the majority leader 
will agree with Senator MANCHIN and 
do what is right for the American peo-
ple: Hit a pause, hold hearings, and 
hold markups before he makes a mock-
ery of the phrase ‘‘the world’s most de-
liberative body,’’ which he is now try-
ing to do with this rushed and reckless 
spending bill.

GABBY PETITO AND FEMICIDE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, 
the tragic story of 22-year-old Gabby 
Petito, whose body was recently found 
at the Grand Teton National Park in 
Wyoming, has captured the attention 
of our Nation. It is an awful story that 
is still playing out. We pray for her 
parents and her loved ones, and we 
hope that they soon will receive jus-
tice. 
As we watch the story unfold, we 
empathize with her family and her 
friends, and we mourn with them, and 
we think about how this horrible crime 
hurts all of them, their neighbors, our 
fellow citizens, the result of such a bru-
tal murder. We think of our daughters 
and think of the daughters of others, 
all of our Nation’s daughters. And all 
of this reminds some of us of another 
terrible tragedy in America, and it is 
this: Native and indigenous women in 
America are murdered and sexually as-
saulted at rates as high as 10 times the 
national average. Think about that. 
Horrendous. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has reported that murder is 
the third leading cause of death among 
American Indian and Alaska Native 
women. However, this issue rarely, if 
ever, receives much coverage or aware-
ness. But awareness often results in ad-
ditional resources—something that has 
unfortunately been lacking in our 
criminal justice system on this issue, 
the issue of missing and murdered in-
digenous women. 
According to the FBI’s National 
Crime Information Center, there are 
roughly 1,500 unsolved cases of missing 
and murdered indigenous women in 
America—1,500. Alaska has about 300 of 
these unsolved cases. Experts think 
there are many more such cases that 
don’t make it into the Federal data-
base. 
There has been some progress. Under 
the previous administration, the As-
sistant Secretary of the Interior for In-
dian Affairs, Tara Sweeney, who did 
such a great job, began an initiative 
throughout the Federal Government 
called Operation Lady Justice, the 
whole point of which was to bring light 
to this horrible issue of missing and 
murdered indigenous women, to bring 
justice and hope and closure to their 
families. Operation Lady Justice, the 
task force, has opened up numerous of-
fices across America, including one in 
Alaska. Last year, we in a bipartisan 
way here in the Senate passed Savan-
na’s Act and the Not Invisible Act to 
address the crisis of missing, murdered, 
and trafficked indigenous women in 
our country. Progress is being made, 
but we need to continue to keep this 
issue front and center. 
As we pray for the family of Gabby 
Petito, we also offer our thoughts and 
prayers to the families of these missing 
and murdered indigenous Americans 
and commit to continue to focus on all 
of these issues to make our country a 
better place. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING TOM BUGNITZ ON HIS 
RETIREMENT 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize 
the 
accomplishments 
of 
Tom 
Bugnitz and congratulate him on his upcoming 
retirement. For over 20 years, Tom was a 
proud resident of Colorado where he dedi-
cated his career to helping manufacturing 
businesses and their people be and do better. 
Most recently, Tom led Manufacturers Edge, 
a non-profit that positioned itself as the ‘‘go to’’ 
resource for the manufacturing industry in Col-
orado. Under Tom’s leadership, Manufacturers 
Edge built a strong team of dedicated profes-
sionals and developed an extensive portfolio 
of services—all while dealing with economic 
uncertainty amid the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Tom’s inspirational leadership in manufac-
turing, however, is not confined only to Colo-
rado state lines. Tom was instrumental in 
forming the Center Leadership Team (CLT) for 
the National Institute of the Standards and 
Technology’s (NIST) Manufacturing Extension 
Partnership (MEP) program that developed 
and deployed cybersecurity services to manu-
facturers across the United States. Addition-
ally, as the MEP Center Director for Colorado, 
Tom mentored, inspired, and supported other 
Center Directors across the country while 
working to ensure the voice of Colorado man-
ufacturers were heard by local, state, and fed-
eral lawmakers. 
Throughout Tom’s career he has been a 
champion for small- and medium-sized manu-
facturers both in Colorado and across the 
country. Further, his coworkers attest that 
through hard work, integrity, and a genuine 
passion for making an impact on those around 
him, Tom changed the staff of Manufacturer’s 
Edge from a group of people who work to-
gether to a family united behind the same mis-
sion—to grow and strengthen the Colorado 
manufacturing community. 
Tom’s contributions to the community, the 
manufacturing industry, and those around him 
have been enormous. I congratulate Tom 
Bugnitz on his retirement and thank him for 
his service to our community.

HONORING ANN AWALT 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
a key leader and transformative figure in 
South Texas, Ann Awalt. Ann has over four 
decades of first-hand experience in developing 
rural community service systems and has 
dedicated her time and leadership to the peo-
ple of South Texas. Her service and passion 
for her work is reflected in the lasting impact 
she has had on TX–34 communities and fami-
lies. 
Ann Awalt is a South Texas native, where 
she attended The University of Texas at Aus-
tin and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 
Political Science and Government. She went 
on to develop several rural service systems, 
including the Community Action Corporation of 
South Texas (CACOST) and its network of re-
sources. Ann then attended graduate school 
at The University of Texas at Arlington and 
graduated with a Master of Public Administra-
tion. 
Ann is now the Executive Director of 
CACOST, which serves South Texans in 17 
counties by providing an integrated range of 
health and human services. The network in-
cludes federally qualified health centers, child 
and family development services through 
Head Start and Early Childhood Intervention, 
and community services for nutrition, housing, 
and energy assistance. 
In 2013, Ann strongly advocated for the 
funding of Head Start, a federally subsidized 
program that provides traditionally under-
served children from birth through age five, 
with meals, educational programs, and other 
services to build a solid foundation as these 
children head into their school years. In 2020, 
over 4,200 children benefited from Head Start 
programs in TX–34. The program also in-
cludes senior nutritional services, which pro-
vide elderly residents home-delivered meals; 
and last year served nearly 16,000 persons 
through their Federally Qualified Health Center 
and assisted over 13,000 persons with utility 
assistance. Her hands-on leadership and com-
mitment 
to 
her 
community 
has 
helped 
CACOST secure funding from contracts and 
grants at the federal and state levels, including 
those available through the Head Start model, 
which have enriched the lives of seniors, chil-
dren and families. 
This past year, Ann led the Community Ac-
tion Agency’s response efforts to the chal-
lenges from the COVID–19 pandemic. Along-
side a team of medical experts, she set up six 
clinics around the Coastal Bend to provide life-
saving vaccines and COVID–19 tests for the 
region. Her perseverance led to over 22,000 
vaccinations administered by CACOST. Ann’s 
collaboration with community partners in the 
Coastal Bend ensure that these vital health 
and nutritional services will continue to be 
available to those living throughout South 
Texas. Ann also represents South Texas as a 
member of the Texas Association of Commu-
nity Action Agencies, serving on both the Ex-
ecutive Committee and the Legislative Com-
mittee. 
Ann Awalt is truly a pillar of determination 
who exemplifies selfless service and dedica-
tion to her community. She continues to foster 
growth and action, while advocating for the 
people who need it most. It is clear that Ann 
Awalt is deeply invested in the people of 
South Texas and we cannot thank her enough 
for her service.

Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, the National

I am proud to announce that Brandon Ele-
mentary School was recognized as a National

believe the education of our youth, the future

HONORING THOMAS HUFFORD 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Thomas Michael Hufford, who 
passed away on August 29, 2021, at the age 
of 86. Mr. Hufford was a prominent business 
owner and community leader in the Roanoke 
area. 
Mr. Hufford was born on August 14, 1935 in 
Huntington, West Virginia to Genevieve Eloise 
Kirley Wippel Hufford of Huntington and An-
thony Wippel. He graduated in 1953 from St. 
Joseph High School in Huntington, West Vir-
ginia where he served as president of his 
class. He attended Virginia Polytechnic Insti-
tute in Blacksburg, Virginia, graduating in 
1957. Following college, he was in the army 
reserves at Fort Knox. 
Mr. Hufford was an insurance agent by 
trade and owner of Hufford Insurance in Roa-
noke, Virginia. For all his life, he sustained a 
strong voice in politics and his community. He 
served as the Planning Commissioner of Roa-
noke County for several years. He also ran for 
State Senate and Congress of Virginia in the 
1970s. His civic service through business and 
leadership made a profound impact on his 
community and those around him. 
Mr. Hufford was preceded in death by his 
wife, Ada D. Hufford. He is survived by his two 
daughters, Karen Hufford and Jill Hufford, and 
his younger brother, Frederick M. Hufford. He 
also has two granddaughters, Morgan Dilling 
and Samantha Hufford, and a great-grand-
daughter, Melah Grace Dilling. I offer them my 
condolences on their loss.

IN RECOGNITION OF MRS. ELLA B. 
SPEED ON HER 101ST BIRTHDAY 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Apalachicola native Ella Breedlove 
Speed, who is turning 101. 
Mrs. Ella is a pillar in her community and a 
role model for many. For more than two dec-
ades, she worked for the Franklin County 
School District as a bookkeeper. She also has 
served as a missionary in the Holiness Church 
of the Living God and is currently serving as 
an elder and bishop in the Love Center 
Church. 
Bishop Speed’s heart for serving others is 
unmatched and her energetic spirit is infec-
tious. Make no mistake, age is just a number. 
Mrs. Ella is still just as sharp as she was in 
her younger days and she has not stopped 
serving and comforting others. 
I want to personally thank this incredible 
woman for her contribution to Apalachicola 
and Florida’s Second Congressional District as 
a whole. Happy birthday to Mrs. Ella.

HONORING DR. PATRICK 
BURCHFIELD 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the work of Dr. Patrick Burchfield, Direc-
tor of the Gladys Porter Zoo, which is located 
in Brownsville, Texas. Under Dr. Burchfield’s 
leadership, the Gladys Porter Zoo has grown 
significantly since it first opened in 1971, and 
he has served at the forefront of one of the 
world’s most notable international endangered 
species recovery programs. 
Dr. Burchfield joined the staff at the Gladys 
Porter Zoo in 1971, working in every capacity 
and eventually became director in 2007, which 
he earned through hard work and dedication 
to the Zoo. 
As director of the Zoo, Dr. Burchfield has 
led efforts to make the zoo more inclusive and 
accessible to all members of his community— 
but especially those with disabilities. Last year, 
the zoo opened a newly renovated Giraffe 
Landing Feeding Experience—complete with 
an ADA-accessible platform so that all may 
participate. 
Under his leadership, the zoo has added fa-
cilities for critically endangered species such 
as Orinoco crocodiles and threatened species 
like nurse sharks. Along with creating a safe 
environment for these imperiled species, the 
Gladys Potter Zoo has showcased species 
that are native to the Rio Grande Valley such 
as 
diamondback 
terrapins, 
black-spotted 
newts and red-crowned amazons. 
Forty years ago, endangered Kemp’s ridley 
sea turtles were on the brink of extinction, but 
this changed shortly after Dr. Burchfield, then 
the Zoo’s Curator of Herpetology, stepped into 
the picture. In 1981, Dr. Burchfield, at the re-
quest of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, ac-
cepted the role of Coordinator for the U.S. 
contingent 
of 
the 
U.S./Mexico 
Binational 
Kemp’s Ridley Sea Tuttle Recovery Program. 
Program activities included protecting the wild 
nests and hatchlings of this imperiled species 
at its primary nesting grounds in Rancho 
Nuevo, Mexico. From 1985 to present, the 
number of nesting female turtles rose from 
283 to an estimated 7,000 to 9,000. 
When asked why he cared so much about 
Kemp’s Ridley sea turtles, Dr. Burchfield said, 
‘‘I saw an opportunity to try and do something 
meaningful, and that maybe we would have a 
shot at saving this species. So, my job was to 
do whatever I could do to help make that hap-
pen.’’ 
Since 1992, Dr. Burchfield has been an in-
structor at the University of Texas Rio Grande 
Valley in the Department of Biology. He is pri-
marily responsible for the development and 
implementation of the introductory zoo biology 
course, 
a 
prerequisite 
for 
all 
aspiring 
zoologists. In this capacity, Dr. Burchfield 
sought to further the efficacy of his animal 
conservation efforts by inspiring the environ-
mental champions of tomorrow right in the 
heart of South Texas. 
Madam Speaker, not only is Dr. Burchfield 
a leader in animal conservation, but he is un-
doubtedly one of the most humble men I have 
had the pleasure of meeting. His work has 
never revolved around self-interest or acco-
lades, but rather his genuine desire to save 
species and raise awareness about the need 
to preserve our planet’s dwindling natural re-
sources. I thank him for the essential role he 
has played in shaping a healthier future for all 
and for choosing to make Brownsville, Texas 
his home.

HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today regarding a vote I missed on September 
23, 2021. Had I been present for Roll Call 
Vote 284 to H.R. 4350, the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, I would 
have voted no. I do not believe that a 10 per-
cent across the board reduction in funding, as 
this amendment proposed, is a responsible 
way to reduce spending.

Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Ridge, Colorado for receiving the 2021 Wheat 
Ridge Chamber of Commerce Volunteer of the 
Year Award. 
The Wheat Ridge Chamber of Commerce 
Volunteer of the Year Award recognizes a

their outstanding volunteer services and con-
tribution to their local community. Sean Neelan 
is the recipient of this year’s award due to his 
unmatched willingness and dedication to an-
swer the call of his community. Sean went 
above and beyond and dedicated countless 
hours of service to the Wheat Ridge commu-
nity. 
Congratulations to Sean Neelan for his pub-
lic service and I extend my deep appreciation 
for his contributions to our community.

HONORING MEL HUBER 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Melvyn Jay Huber of Blacksburg, Vir-
ginia. At 92 years of age, this Marine Corps 
veteran is not done serving his country or 
looking out for others. Mel has been troubled 
by the divisions too often found in our country 
and the despair it has created for some. For 
them, he has a simple message: your life mat-
ters. 
‘‘Your life matters’’ is how he greets people. 
It is what he writes on the lowest left of every 
envelope that leaves his mailbox. He pur-
chased 100 yard signs with this message, and 
since he is currently in hospice care, others 
have come by to pick up the signs and put 
them on display. Currently, the signs can be 
found in six counties and two independent cit-
ies of Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District, 
which I represent, as well as three north-
eastern states. 
For someone in trouble, hearing from an-
other the simple words ‘‘your life matters’’ can 
be tremendously reassuring. I commend Mel 
Huber, a resident of the Ninth District, for 
sharing his healing message.

CELEBRATING FILIPINO AMERICAN 
HISTORY MONTH 
HON. ANDY LEVIN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam Speaker, 
this October, I am proud to celebrate Filipino 
American History Month, which acknowledges 
the vast contributions of Filipino Americans to 
our communities in Michigan and across the 
country. I am thrilled to join the residents of 
Macomb and Oakland Counties in highlighting 
the vibrancy of this community and celebrate 
Filipino Americans. 
For generations, Filipino Americans in Michi-
gan have influenced the culture and history of 
our state—engaging deeply in public institu-
tions, our local economies and statewide cul-
tural events. I am grateful for their emphasis 
on service and selfless commitment to their 
neighbors. Further, Filipino Americans have 
gifted Southeast Michigan with a rich culture 
and history that enhances the fabrics of our 
communities. I also recognize the vital con-
tributions of the Filipino Americans in building 
spaces free of discrimination, prejudice and ig-
norance. 
Additionally, I am honored to present the 
United States Pinoys 4 Good Governance 
(USP4GG) Michigan with special recognition 
for their efforts throughout the state. USP4GG 
has been instrumental in promoting Filipino 
culture and tradition in Michigan, helping all of 
us develop a better understanding of their his-
tory. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Michiganders to fol-
low the many ways USP4GG and our other 
Filipino neighbors are helping us celebrate the 
Filipino American History Month this year. 
RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF ARI-
ZONA STATE REPRESENTATIVE 
FRANK PRATT 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize and honor the life of Arizona 
State Representative Franklin M. Pratt. Frank 
represented the 8th Legislative District of Ari-
zona well and served his community as a 
member of both the House and the Senate. A 
principled conservative who stood firmly for 
the values he believed in, Frank tirelessly ad-
vocated for the people of rural Arizona. He 
loved the state he called home and led a long 
and admirable life of civil service. 
In addition to Frank’s public service as a 
state legislator, he also served his community 
as a farmer, rancher, businessman, and was 
a dedicated family man. Madam Speaker, I 
am here to express my appreciation for the 
impact of Frank’s service in our Arizona com-
munities and to offer my deepest condolences 
to his family and beloved wife, Janice. Frank’s 
achievements and community impact will 
never be forgotten by the people of Arizona.

IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 4350, THE NA-
TIONAL 
DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank Chairman SMITH, Ranking Mem-
ber ROGERS, and the Members of the Com-
mittee for their leadership in crafting a De-
fense Authorization Bill that is in line with what 
Secretary Mattis said we needed in the 2018 
National Defense Strategy: 3–5 percent real 
growth from FY22 to FY25. 
This bill addresses the critical areas of 
emerging tech, research and development, 
Airpower and Sea power, shipbuilding, and 
Space among many others. 
I would specifically like to thank the Chair 
and Ranking Member for the inclusion of crit-
ical innovation priorities that I requested, such 
as: 
The designation of Entrepreneurial Innova-
tion Projects, which will more effectively transi-
tion Small Business Innovation Research pro-
grams into the Services’ budget process; 
The Pilot Program to Facilitate the Agile Ac-
quisition of Technologies for Warfighters and 
new line for Agile Procurement Transition Pilot 
programs in the amount of $100,000,000. This 
authorization will be critical as we seek to 
compete with China by leveraging the innova-
tive power of our private sector; 
And for the much needed report on flexible 
funding for transitioning science and tech-
nology. 
The DoD should not be doing research and 
development for the sake of doing research. 
We should always have an eye on developing 
cutting edge capabilities for the warfighter. For 
far too long the DoD has struggled to transi-
tion and scale critical innovative technologies 
from development projects to acquisition pro-
grams in a time period that meets the needs 
of the warfighter and ensures technology pro-
viders are able to survive. This report will help 
Congress understand why so we can develop 
ways to solve the problem of ‘‘the valley of 
death’’. 
Let me be clear, we are in a geopolitical 
competition with China, and experts on both 
sides of the aisle agree that the current budg-
eting and acquisition process is not adequate 
to compete and win. 
As the Defense bills move through Con-
gress, I look forward to Authorizing and Appro-
priating the funding, capabilities, and re-
sources that our warfighters need to fight to-
night and modernize for the future.

HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
PINE 
BLUFF FIRE AND EMERGENCY 
SERVICES, ENGINEER CORY COL-
LINS 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Cory P. Collins, 
a Fire and Emergency Services Engineer at 
Pine Bluff Fire Station No. 6 in Pine Bluff, Ar-
kansas. Engineer Collins passed away on Au-
gust 21, 2021, after a battle with COVID–19. 
Cory was a 9-year veteran of Pine Bluff Fire 
and Emergency Services where he served his 
community honorably alongside fellow emer-
gency responders who were like brothers to 
him. He excelled as a firefighter and was pro-
moted to engineer in May 2018. Engineer Col-
lins was a ‘‘jack of all trades,’’ and in his free 
time, he enjoyed working on numerous 
projects, spending time with his family, and 
escaping to the outdoors. He will be greatly 
missed by his family, his brothers and sisters 
at Pine Bluff Fire and Emergency Services, 
and by his community. 
I take this time today to honor Engineer Col-
lins’ exceptional service to our Pine Bluff com-
munity. His steadfast approach and dedication 
to his neighbors during the current public 
health crises will be forever cherished. With a 
heavy heart, I thank Engineer Collins and his 
family for their unwavering dedication to the 
city of Pine Bluff and surrounding area.

Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the National Defense Au-
thorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022, including 
my three amendments included in this legisla-
tion. 
The FY 22 NDAA authorizes critically impor-
tant funding and programs for our Armed 
Forces who put their lives on the line to pro-
tect our nation and our people. The legislation 
ensures our servicemembers and their families 
have the resources they need and deserve to 
continue serving our country.

safe and healthy. I had the pleasure of watch-
ing them grow up and become the men they 
are today. 
I think we can all agree that a parent’s worst 
nightmare is losing a child. Any parent that 
has to bury to their child deserves the time 
and dignity to cope with that grief—a hole in 
the heart that doesn’t heal, but around which 
one must build anew and move forward how-
ever possible. 
I hope that someday time to fully mourn a 
child is available for everyone in America, but 
at least my amendment to the FY 22 NDAA 
would guarantee paid bereavement leave for 
federal employees. This is an important step 
forward and I hope that we can show even 
more compassion in the future. 
My second amendment would codify the 
Boots to Business program into law. 
Boots to Business is an established, suc-
cessful training program that has helped 
servicemembers transitioning into civilian life 
to start their own businesses. It has already 
trained more than 100,000 servicemembers on 
the essential skills of entrepreneurship and 
this amendment would ensure that many more 
can benefit from it. 
My final amendment would have the Depart-
ment of Defense create a U.S.-Israel Oper-
ations-Technology Working Group. This work-
ing group will enable further sharing of infor-
mation vital to combating current and future 
threats and enhance our mutual security and 
the security of the Middle East as a whole. 
I appreciate the inclusion of my three 
amendments in the FY 22 NDAA and support 
its passage.

HONORING ANTHONY J. WONG 
HON. DWIGHT EVANS 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor an influential and dedicated gentleman 
from Philadelphia, Anthony J. Wong, a de-
voted public servant, and former Philadelphia 
Police Chief Inspector who died on September 
8, 2021 at the age of 93. 
Anthony J. Wong was born in Philadelphia 
on April 17, 1928 and was the only child of 
Chinese immigrants who owned a restaurant 
in Chinatown. After high school, he joined the 
Army and served in the World War II Occupa-
tion Forces in Europe. He also served in the 
Korean War. In the Army, he served in coun-
terintelligence, as interrogator, a translator, 
and in the military police. 
Inspector Wong dedicated his life and ca-
reer to this country and to the city of Philadel-
phia. He joined the Philadelphia Police Depart-
ment in 1953 after serving in the U.S. Army. 
At that time, he was the sole Chinese Amer-
ican officer on the force. He retired from the 
police force in 2003 as the highest-ranking of-
ficer of Asian American descent. 
While in the Philadelphia Police Department, 
Mr. Wong served in several units, including in 
narcotics, vice enforcement, and patrol. He 
twice led the Training Bureau and commanded 
the Community Relations Division and the Pa-
trol Bureau, which encompassed emergency 
planning. His last assignment was as Com-
manding Officer of the Police Training Bureau 
at the Police Academy. 
Mr. Wong was well rounded and highly re-
spected by many. A man with many talents, 
he spoke multiple languages. He attended the 
University of Vienna in Austria, the Fels Insti-
tute of Local and State Government at the 
University of Pennsylvania, and the Universal 
School of Languages and Translation Bureau. 
Additionally, Mr. Wong was a college ad-
junct professor. He taught criminal justice, 
criminal investigation, and laws and proce-
dures at the Community College of Philadel-
phia. He was fluent in German and used his 
skills to help Jewish concentration camp sur-
vivors who relocated to Philadelphia. 
Furthermore, he was very active in his com-
munity. He was a founding member of the 
Philadelphia Chinatown Development Corp. 
(PCDC), which was founded in 1969 after the 
Chinatown community in Philadelphia began 
fighting plans to demolish Holy Redeemer 
Catholic Church and School to build the Vine 
Street Expressway. Although he was a police 
captain and could not partake in the street 
protests, he attended meetings and offered his 
expertise. He was also on the board of the On 
Lok House, an apartment building for low-in-
come senior citizens. According to Cecilia Moy 
Yep, the PCDC founder, Mr. Wong was ‘‘very 
faithful to Chinatown. He was active in the 
meetings, particularly on the On Lok House. 
That was his baby.’’ 
As evidenced by his historic career Anthony 
J. Wong, dedicated his life to advocating and 
improving the lives of others. He was a model 
public servant. The 3rd Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania extends gratitude to Mr. 
Wong for his dedicated support and service to 
the Chinatown community and the city of 
Philadelphia. And offer sincere condolences to 
his family and friends on his passing. 
RECOGNIZING THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE GOOD HART GEN-
ERAL STORE 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the 
Good Hart General Store of Emmet County, 
Michigan. Through its five decades of service 
and steadfast devotion to its community, the 
General Store has become a local landmark 
and an indispensable part of Michigan’s First 
District. 
The General Store was first constructed in 
1934 by local resident, Cliff Powers. Along 
with serving as a local Postmaster, Mr. Pow-
ers used his store as a grocer and gas station 
to bring needed supplies to his community. He 
would continue to operate his local business 
for almost 40 years until selling it to Carolyn 
Sutherland in 1971. She has successfully pre-
served the history and significance of the Gen-
eral Store ever since. While also managing 
the store, Ms. Sutherland leads Graham Real 
Estate in Good Hart where she has continu-
ously worked to better the lives of her commu-
nity and the State of Michigan. 
Madam Speaker, it’s my honor to recognize 
the Good Hart General Store for fifty years of 
success and service to Northern Michigan. 
Michiganders can take great pride in knowing 
the First District is home to such dedicated 
citizens that help preserve our most treasured 
businesses and landmarks. On behalf of my 
constituents, I wish them all the best in their 
future endeavors.

Park in the District of Columbia as ‘‘Rock 
Creek National Park.’’ Renaming this park will 
highlight its significance to the nation, includ-
ing visitors to the nation’s capital, and will 
draw much-needed funding for the park’s invit-
ing trails, waterways and other unique fea-
tures. 
Rock Creek Park is already a ‘‘national’’ 
park, as it was established by Congress in 
1890 ‘‘for the benefit and enjoyment of the 
people of the United States.’’ Rock Creek Park 
was the first federally managed urban park 
and the third federal park ever created, after 
Yellowstone and Sequoia. Rock Creek Park 
was designed to preserve animals, timber, for-
estry and other interests in the park, and to 
ensure that its natural state is maintained as 
much as possible not only for D.C. residents, 
but for all Americans. The park also preserves 
the ancient history of the land, as it was used 
for temporary settlements and as a quarry for 
weapons and tools by Native Americans from 
7000 BCE until the 1600s. 
Since Congress first designated Rock Creek 
Park, several structures and properties have 
been established or donated to further pre-
serve Rock Creek Park, creating a vast con-
nected park area that falls under a central 
NPS jurisdiction. In 1892, the federal govern-
ment acquired Peirce Mill in Rock Creek Park, 
one of the mills used by local farmers during 
the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. In 1950, the 
Old Stone House located in Georgetown, with 
its great pre-Revolutionary War architecture, 
was acquired by the park. The building was 
restored and programs explain the house’s 
rich history from the colonial period to the 
present day. The Fort Circle Parks were also 
acquired to interpret and preserve the Civil 
War Defenses of Washington, which created a 
ring of protection for the nation’s capital during 
the Civil War. The Carter Barron Amphi-
theater, established in honor of the 150th an-
niversary of the nation’s capital, became an in-
tegral part of D.C.’s live music scene, and has 
featured acts including Ella Fitzgerald, Diana 
Ross and Earth, Wind and Fire, as well as 
local artists. The redesignated ‘‘Rock Creek 
National Park’’ would encompass these later 
additions to the park. 
Today, Rock Creek Park offers residents of 
D.C., Maryland and Northern Virginia, as well 
as thousands of visitors, an escape from our 
increasingly urban environment. Residents 
and tourists alike enjoy many activities in the 
park’s 2,000 acres, including hiking and biking 
on the historical trails, horseback riding, pic-
nicking, tennis and other recreational activities 
in some of the open fields. Our residents have 
expressed their appreciation by volunteering to 
clean up and maintain the forests, trails and 
waterways. 
In 1918, landscape architects John Charles 
Olmstead and Frederick Law Olmstead, Jr. 
wrote of Rock Creek Park, ‘‘No matter how 
perfect the scenery of the park may be or may 
become, no matter how high its potential 
value, that value remains potential except in-
sofar as it is enjoyed by large and ever larger 
numbers of people, poor and rich alike.’’ Re-
designating Rock Creek Park as Rock Creek 
National Park will help recognize the national 
status of the park and protect and revitalize 
this remarkable resource in our nation’s cap-
ital. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
legislation.

H.R. 4350, NATIONAL DEFENSE AU-
THORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL 
YEAR 2022 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, on Sep-
tember 23, I voted in opposition to H.R. 4350, 
the 
National 
Defense 
Authorization 
Act 
(NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. While I 
support several Democratic policy priorities in-
cluded in this legislation, I also have signifi-
cant concerns with numerous provisions, in-
cluding the irresponsibly bloated topline de-
fense spending of $768 billion that this legisla-
tion authorizes. 
I strongly support the well-deserved 2.7 per-
cent pay raise that this legislation grants our 
men and women in uniform. This is the very 
least we can do for those who continue to 
make extraordinary sacrifices for our country. 
This legislation includes additional vital ben-
efits for military servicemembers and their 
families, such as expanded parental leave, im-
proved mental health care services, a new 
basic needs allowance for lower income 
servicemembers, and more. 
I also strongly support the provisions in-
cluded to combat the scourge of sexual as-
sault in the military, including by creating an 
Office of Special Victim Prosecutor to pros-
ecute these crimes, removing the commanding 
officer from decisions related to sexual as-
sault, and finally criminalizing sexual harass-
ment under the Uniform Code of Military Jus-
tice. 
As a long-time advocate for strengthening 
Congress’s constitutional war powers authori-
ties and limiting executive authority to engage 
in armed conflict without Congress’s consent, 
I cosponsored an amendment to prohibit un-
authorized U.S. participation in the Saudi-led 
coalition’s war in Yemen. I am pleased that 
this amendment passed the House and will 
push my colleagues to keep this amendment 
in the final NOAA conference legislation. 
While I strongly support provisions in this 
year’s NDAA, I ultimately voted against it be-
cause I believe this legislation should have in-
cluded additional provisions to rein in our 
bloated and wasteful defense spending, take 
back Congress’s constitutional war powers au-
thority, and more. 
Instead of increasing the defense budget by 
several billion dollars for yet another year in a 
row, I strongly believe this legislation could 
have made responsible cuts to our defense 
budget without jeopardizing the safety of our 
troops or undermining our national security. 
It’s beyond time for us to invest in domestic 
priorities for Oregonians and the American 
people here at home. 
That’s why I supported an amendment to re-
sponsibly reduce the Pentagon budget while 
retaining exceptions to protect service mem-
bers, civilian employees, and the vital Defense 
Health Program from this reduction. Unfortu-
nately, this amendment failed to pass the 
House. 
For years, Congress has continued to in-
crease the Pentagon’s budget despite over-
whelming evidence of its waste, fraud, and 
abuse of taxpayer money. It’s absolutely ridic-
ulous and irresponsible to continue throwing 
increasing amounts of taxpayer money at the 
Pentagon and lining the pockets of greedy de-
fense contractors and special interests every 
year, when the Pentagon cannot even account 
for where this money goes. 
I have long supported a financial audit of 
the Pentagon. Unlike every other federal 
agency, the DOD has yet to ever pass a finan-
cial audit. For three years in a row, the Pen-
tagon has spectacularly failed full audits, each 
of which highlighted numerous examples of 
waste and abuse. It is ridiculous to provide the 
Pentagon a massive spending increase—as 
this bill does—when the Pentagon cannot 
even account for how it spends taxpayer 
money. That’s why I’m a cosponsor of legisla-
tion to require and incentivize every compo-
nent of the DOD to finally pass an audit. 
This legislation should have included more 
provisions to take back Congress’s constitu-
tional war powers authority, including repeal-
ing the long-outdated 2001 and 2002 author-
izations for the use of military force (AUMFs). 
I also cosponsored and voted in favor of an 
amendment to end unauthorized U.S. military 
involvement in Syria. TI1e U.S. military has 
maintained a years-long presence in Syria 
without congressional approval, in contraven-
tion of the Constitution and the War Powers 
Resolution of 1973. While this amendment un-
fortunately failed, I will continue fighting to 
stop this unauthorized, endless war. 
I am also disappointed that amendments I 
supported either failed to pass the House or 
were not made in order. This includes amend-
ments to curb the irresponsible expansion of 
U.S. nuclear weapons, to strengthen Buy 
America provisions to ensure the military sup-
ports U.S. manufacturers, to ensure veterans 
who were wrongfully dishonorably discharged 
for their sexual orientation are able to receive 
the veterans benefits they earned, and more. 
I also strongly oppose provisions in this leg-
islation that would expand military draft reg-
istration to all Americans aged 18–25, includ-
ing women. I have long opposed military draft 
registration and have introduced legislation to 
repeal the Selective Service System (SSS) al-
together. The SSS is an archaic, unnecessary, 
unwanted, and wasteful bureaucracy that vio-
lates Americans’ civil liberties and subjects 
Americans who fail to register—largely through 
no fault of their own—with unnecessarily se-
vere, lifelong penalties, all without due proc-
ess. These penalties can include denial of em-
ployment, job training, educational benefits, 
student loans, grants, citizenship, driver’s li-
censes, and more—at both the federal and 
state levels—and they disproportionately affect 
low income individuals and people of color. 
The military itself and presidents of both 
parties have consistently agreed there is no 
military or national security imperative to ever 
reinstate a draft. 
That’s why I co-led amendments to repeal 
military draft registration and eliminate these

extrajudicial penalties. While these amend-
ments were not made in order, I will continue 
fighting to repeal the SSS and end military 
draft registration. No American, regardless of 
gender, should ever be subject to or forced to 
register for an obsolete military draft. 
The bottom line is that fiscal responsibility 
and accountability at the DOD would allow for 
taxpayer funds to be better spent supporting 
the needs of our troops, meeting our obliga-
tions to veterans, and ensuring our legitimate 
defense needs are prioritized while also bol-
stering long-underfunded domestic priorities. I 
will continue fighting to responsibly lower our 
bloated defense spending and finally put an 
end to our endless wars.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JOSH GOTTHEIMER

Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, on

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
BISHOP 
HARRY S. GRAYSON AND HIS 30 
YEARS OF SERVICE TO MESSIAS 
TEMPLE CHURCH 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, September 27, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bishop Harry S. Grayson. 
of Ypsilanti, Michigan. He is an extraordinary 
leader in faith and an example of compassion 
personified. His lifetime of service and dedica-
tion to our community is worthy of commenda-
tion. 
Bishop Grayson grew up on the southside 
of Ypsilanti, Michigan. He became Bishop of 
Messias Temple Church in Ypsilanti on Sep-
tember 1991 with the support of his congrega-
tion, he was installed by Bishop Willie Burrell 
in January 1992. In 1999, he became a Dis-
trict Elder and in 2011 was named Suffragan 
Bishop. In 2018, he was elevated to the office 
of Diocesan Bishop of the 60th Episcopal Dis-
trict Council of the Western Cape, South Afri-
ca. His ministry in Africa has led him across 
the continent from Egypt in the north to 
Zimbabwe in the south. After a ten-day stint in 
Harare, Zimbabwe spent spreading the word, 
Bishop Grayson was able to provide the need-
ed funding for a new church sanctuary and for 
the construction of a new medical clinic to be 
named in his honor. 
A man of conviction and steadfast faith, 
Bishop Grayson is a trusted leader and friend 
to those who know him. He is mentor to chil-
dren and adults alike, from the youth of the 
church to government and educational lead-
ers—they all benefit from his wisdom and 
love. Even in the face of a lengthy battle with 
COVID–19, his strength has never once fal-
tered. We are grateful that he is a distin-
guished leader in our community who con-
tinues to give back to the place where he 
came of age. Where some see hopelessness, 
he can see opportunity. Whether it is in clean-
ing up local parks, mentoring the formerly in-
carcerated, or helping out with Messias Tem-
ple Church’s expansive ‘‘We Care We Share’’ 
ministry—Bishop Grayson provides compas-
sion to those who need it the most. Never 
once in his thirty years has he given up in the 
face of a challenge. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Bishop Harry S. Grayson, a 
pillar of our community, a son of Ypsilanti, a 
leader, and a man of true faith. We extend our 
thanks to his family for their everlasting sup-
port—his wife First Lady Mary Grayson, and 
his children Evan, Maya, and Shari. We join 
with his congregation, friends, and family in 
wishing Bishop Grayson the best in the years 
to come and thank him for his work in 
bettering the community for us all.
