REMEMBERING OFFICER KAIA 
GRANT 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor fallen Springdale police officer and hero 
Kaia Grant, who gave her life in the line of 
duty. 
Growing up in Wyoming, Ohio, friends, fam-
ily, and peers knew Officer Grant was des-
tined for greatness. Officer Grant exemplified 
the best of what our nation has to offer—com-
mitment to fighting for justice and protecting 
our people. She was a dedicated public serv-
ant who lost her life trying to help others. 
The loss of Officer Grant is deeply felt in 
Wyoming, in Springdale, and across Hamilton 
County. Community members have displayed 
blue hearts on their front doors in memory of 
her and in solidarity with the Springdale Police 
Department. 
I pray that God will bring comfort to Officer 
Grant’s family, to the law enforcement commu-
nity, and to all those in the Hamilton County 
community grieving her loss. While God has 
called Kaia Grant away from us, the positive 
impact of her service shall never die. 
God bless.

THANK YOU TO WASHINGTON 
STATE’S FIRST RESPONDERS 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today with appreciation for health 
care workers in Washington state who are 
leading the charge against COVID–19. 
The bravery and resilience of health care 
professionals throughout the COVID–19 re-
sponse is inspiring. Many health care workers 
are facing the toughest challenges of their pro-
fessional careers. Still these professionals 
continue to provide lifesaving care to their pa-
tients. In my conversations with health care 
professionals, I know the personal toll these 
past weeks have taken, as they work to keep 
communities safe while living with the fear of 
contracting COVID–19 and exposing their 
loved ones to the disease. 
In addition, I want to express all of North-
west Washington’s gratitude to the hundreds 
of volunteer health care workers across Wash-
ington state who have stepped up. In this time 
of crisis, retired health care workers and med-
ical students are rising to the occasion, treat-
ing patients and keeping Washingtonians safe. 
Madam Speaker, the current COVID–19 
pandemic has presented Washington’s health 
care workers with what seem like impossible 
challenges. Despite the obstacles, doctors, 
nurses, volunteers and other medical profes-
sionals are showing up every day to care for 
their friends, neighbors, and communities. On 
behalf of a grateful community, I express my 
sincere thanks.

TRIBUTE TO LUCIE GIKOVICH 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and pay tribute to an outstanding in-
dividual and my dear friend, Lucie Yvonne 
Gikovich, who lost her hard-fought battle with 
pancreatic cancer at the age of 70 on March 
11, 2020. Lucie was a lover of life, a caring 
friend and she will be deeply missed. 
In all Lucie did, every role she played, and 
every job title she held, she had a lasting im-
pact on those around her. She began her ca-
reer as an integral part of Jerry Brown’s team, 
both throughout his gubernatorial campaign 
and during his first eight years in the California 
Governor’s office. She worked behind the 
scenes, often running the day-to-day oper-
ations of the office as Brown’s executive as-
sistant. She went on to also serve as his 
scheduler, as a cabinet secretary, and as the 
campaign press secretary during his run for 
the U.S. Senate. 
Lucie received her undergraduate degree 
from Immaculate Heart College and pursued a 
graduate degree from the University of San 
Francisco before joining Brown’s campaign in 
1974. After serving in the Governor’s office, 
Lucie began a successful career in public af-
fairs and lobbying. She was an integral player 
in the organization of the 1984 Summer Olym-
pics in Los Angeles and subsequently man-
aged public affairs for Major League Baseball. 
Later, she joined the Crane Group and went 
on to have a successful career in government 
relations in both Sacramento and Washington 
D.C. 
Beyond her long list of career accolades, 
Lucie will be remembered for love of her Cro-
atian heritage. Lucie’s father immigrated to the 
United States from Croatia and her mother 
was also of Croatian descent and to honor 
that legacy she helped to establish the Cro-
atian Congressional Caucus. She will also be 
remembered as a fighter, as prior to her battle 
with pancreatic cancer, Lucie beat breast can-
cer twice. I extend my heartfelt condolences to 
the Gikovich family, and although Lucie may 
be gone, the impact she made on her commu-
nity will be long lasting. 
EXPRESSING THE UNITED STATES’ 
SOLIDARITY WITH FRIENDS AND 
ALLIES IN EUROPE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise to re-
port discussions I had last week during a 
video conference with members of the Organi-
zation for Security and Co-operation in Europe 
(OSCE) Parliamentary Assembly, and their re-
sponse to COVID–19. 
Let me stress at the outset that our country 
has not only treaty-bound allies in Europe, but 
genuine friends. Our friends and colleagues 
abroad welcomed Senator ROGER WICKER and 
my participation on behalf of the United States 
to discuss how we will continue our important 
duties amidst the dire situation facing the 
globe. I reported on the increasingly dire situa-
tion here in the United States and the efforts 
of the U.S. Congress to provide relief to our 
citizens. We all expressed solidarity with each 
other and a determination to move forward. 
Every country in Europe is affected by this 
pandemic, Madam Speaker, just as every 
state in the United States is affected. The 
President of the Lombardy in Italy spoke about 
the particularly critical situation his region is 
facing. In a crisis like this, while we have our 
primary responsibilities here at home, it is im-
perative we continue to help our international 
friends and partners. I assured our partners 
that the United States will continue to support 
our allies and provide considerable assistance 
to public health worldwide. 
Such expressions of transatlantic unity, in 
my view, are important in times like these. 
They give our European friends and allies the 
confidence they need to move forward. It also 
helps to counter the considerable amount of 
misinformation and misperception currently 
spreading and dispel the malign influence at-
tached to offers of help and friendship from 
elsewhere around the globe. We cannot let ul-
terior motives divide and weaken our ties at 
this time of vulnerability. 
In spite of this crisis, other threats to Euro-
pean security have not gone away. Russian 
aggression against its neighbors, terrorist 
threats, and protracted conflicts in Eastern Eu-
rope and the Caucasus all still exist, requiring 
our continued attention. Much of our par-
liamentary conversation focused on how we 
can address these continual challenges we 
face while we are unable to meet and delib-
erate in person as scheduled. Despite the un-
certainty, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly 
will find a way and with a little creativity, will 
continue having these important discussions. 
A final point made in the video conference 
is the need to defend our democratic prin-
ciples and human rights in a time where re-
strictions and limits are imposed that could be 
abused. Our country defended Europe from 
tyranny last century, so it is rewarding to see 
our friends and allies determined to preserve 
those gains moving forward into this century.

April 7, 2020 
Madam Speaker, we have the capacity to 
address the ongoing threats to our security 
even as we address this unprecedented public 
health crisis amidst an economic downturn. 
The bicameral group of legislators who serve 
on the U.S. Helsinki Commission do so in a 
bipartisan way, and when we participate in the 
OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, we do so with 
our European friends and allies in this effort. 
I concluded from my discussions last week 
that more difficult times may lie ahead, but by 
working together, we will persevere. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today rec-
ognizing the importance of these discussions 
with our European allies and friends.

TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT MAJOR 
RALPH SARGENT 
HON. SETH MOULTON 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. MOULTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the service of an American pa-
triot and decorated Marine, Sergeant Major 
Ralph Sargent. Sargent took part in some of 
the most intense fighting of the Vietnam War, 
including the Battle of Khe Sanh, when the 
hilltop outpost of 6,000 Marines was sur-
rounded by 34,000 North Vietnamese troops. 
Despite heavy artillery bombardment and the 
constant threat of being overrun, the Marines, 
of course, held their ground. Later while on 
patrol, his company got into an extended fire-
fight that would claim the lives of 35 Marines, 
but it would have been far worse if not for Ser-
geant Major Sargent’s actions that earned him 
the Bronze Star with a ‘‘Combat V’’ for ex-
traordinary heroism, in addition to his Navy 
Commendation Medal. 
But one of the greatest stories of his service 
was when he saved the life of another Marine 
decades after Vietnam. That Marine is his 
grandson, whom I was privileged to serve with 
in Iraq. The salty Marine sergeant major rec-
ognized what was wrong with his grandson 
when this great Marine returned from the war 
and, like so many of us, had trouble finding 
meaning in life back home. So one day the 
sergeant major asked his grandson to drive 
him to the VA for an appointment, but when 
they arrived, he told his grandson that the ap-
pointment was actually for him. His grandson, 
my friend, followed the sergeant major’s or-
ders and started going regularly to the VA. I’m 
not sure he would be alive today if he hadn’t. 
And months later, after Sergeant Major Sar-
gent saw what a difference the VA had made 
in his grandson’s life, he decided, for the first 
time, to go himself. 
Madam Speaker, Sergeant Major Sargent 
lived a life of service. Many Marines made it 
through Vietnam thanks to their sergeant 
major, and one of my great Marine friends is 
alive today because of his grandfather. What 
an American hero. 
THANK YOU TO WASHINGTON 
STATE’S FIRST RESPONDERS 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to recognize the valuable service of 
grocery workers. 
Nearly three million grocery workers punch 
the clock in communities across the United 
States. 
In 
Northwest 
Washington, 
these 
women and men put themselves at risk to 
make sure their neighbors are fed. 
Since the COVID–19 outbreak began, I 
have heard from families of grocery employ-
ees who worry every time their loved ones go 
to work. 
Congress must support grocery workers the 
same way they support their communities. 
This means providing paid family and medical 
leave, guaranteeing workers’ rights are pro-
tected and listening when they tell employers 
and Congress what they need to stay safe on 
the job. 
I would like to thank and recognize grocery 
workers for their commitment to keeping 
Washington healthy and fed during this un-
precedented crisis. I encourage my colleagues 
to support these essential workers in any fu-
ture relief package.

INTRODUCTION OF THE IMPROV-
ING ACCESS TO SERVICES ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to introduce the Improving Access to 
Services Act along with my colleagues Con-
gresswoman AYANNA
PRESSLEY
and Con-
gressman MARK TAKANO. 
Our transportation system is failing Ameri-
cans who are stuck in congestion, traveling on 
roads and transit systems in disrepair, and 
forced to travel further and further to reach es-
sential services. 
The Improving Access to Services Act 
would require that ‘safe and convenient ac-
cess to services’ is an added condition for 
States’ minimum standards for public roads— 
for both new construction and roadway im-
provement projects. These services include 
health care facilities, child care, education and 
workforce training, affordable housing, food 
sources, banking and financial institutions, and 
other retail shopping establishments. 
States and metropolitan planning organiza-
tions will assess how the transportation sys-
tem connects people to services by auto, tran-
sit, bike, and pedestrian investments, and en-
sures new investments do not degrade transit, 
bike, and pedestrian access. 
The Improving Access to Services Act will 
also adjust the definition of access to incor-
porate a measurement of travel times, travel 
stress for active travel (bike and pedestrian), 
and cost for low-income travelers. 
I am glad that the Improving Access to 
Services Act is endorsed by Transportation for 
America (T4A), Sierra Club, National Re-
sources Defense Council (NRDC), National 
Association of City Transportation Officials 
(NACTO), Environmental Law and Policy Cen-
ter (ELPC), Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. 
The Improving Access to Services Act will 
reconnect our communities, enabling people to 
take shorter, more convenient trips, reducing 
congestion and emissions, and improving ac-
cess to services for all. 
I urge this body to swiftly pass this legisla-
tion.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ABOUT 
THE CARES ACT 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, The vote we 
took on March 27, 2020, may be the most 
monumental vote during our tenure in Con-
gress. The amount of money we committed 
our nation to is, in itself, epic. The causes of 
this legislation—the coronavirus and govern-
ment reaction to the threat, which has placed 
our economy into a recession—are equally 
momentous. 
The President has wisely acted to limit the 
spread of the outbreak, and he and Senate 
Majority Leader MCCONNELL tried to negotiate 
in good faith with House Democrats. Unfortu-
nately, Speaker PELOSI and Minority Leader 
SCHUMER chose instead to derail the process. 
As a result, we have a bill before us that is 
loaded down with more negative provisions 
than positive ones. 
I have spent the past few days imagining 
what could have been, had the Democrats de-
cided to act as honest brokers. 
Could we have provided the liquidity and 
necessary interim relief for the families and 
businesses of Main Street USA for less than 
$2 trillion? 
Most certainly. And we should have found 
ways to help them because these businesses 
needed our support, because state and local 
governments have shuttered them and placed 
many Americans in economic peril. 
Could we have acted more swiftly? 
Without a doubt. 
Could we have taken the time to repair the 
unemployment compensation portion of the bill 
that Senators SCOTT, SASSE, and GRAHAM 
noted will incentivize people not to work, be-
cause the compensation for unemployment 
will be superior to their wages? 
Might we have produced a bill that didn’t 
spend millions of dollars for non-essential, 
non-emergency-related funding to institutions 
such as the Kennedy Center, NPR, Smithso-
nian, Institute of Museum and Library Serv-
ices, and the National Endowments for the 
Arts and Humanities? 
Could we have done this without strength-
ening the hands of unions in the private sec-
tor? 
These are all painful hypotheticals to think 
about as we look at the enormous sums of un-
necessary spending in this bill. 
To offer merely a few examples, we gave 
$88 million to the Peace Corps, which fired 
over seven thousand volunteers in March. We 
spent millions more for refugee assistance, 
election security, and the Department of Edu-
cation. Some of these efforts may be worth 
funding, but they certainly have no place in an 
economic relief package.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E353 
April 7, 2020 
We currently have a structural deficit of ap-
proximately $1.2 trillion—which, coincidentally, 
is about equal to the discretionary spending of 
Congress. This proposal dwarfs in spending, 
in one day, what we spend on discretionary 
projects in one year. 
Some economists forecast tough times 
ahead for GDP growth. If our amazing econ-
omy, structurally sound just a few weeks ago, 
has slower growth while we are more than 
doubling our structural deficit for the current 
fiscal year—not counting the input of the 
Phase 1 and 2 relief packages, and excluding 
the proposed Phase 4 and 5 packages—we 
could move into an upside-down position in 
the ratio of national debt to GDP. Such a situ-
ation would likely precipitate a sovereign debt 
crisis. 
The President is highly concerned about 
whether our economic cure may be worse 
than the sickness. I suggest that the tem-
porary gains this bill provides are outweighed 
by the acceleration of our already unimagi-
nable national debt, which even before the 
spending package exceeded $23 trillion. 
Lastly, I am disappointed that the bill: 
Grants checks to millions of Americans who 
do not immediately need them and likely will 
not spend them. 
Does not expand Health Savings Accounts. 
Does not go nearly far enough to deregulate 
the healthcare industry or the rest of the econ-
omy. 
Grants far too much discretion to the federal 
bureaucrats to pick-and-choose which compa-
nies outside of the airline industry warrant re-
lief, allowing for government to pick economic 
winners and losers. 
Places so many strings on small business 
assistance that the resulting ‘‘loans’’ are better 
categorized as mandates. 
President Trump asked us all to come to-
gether during this national emergency to pass 
relief that would truly help our country return 
to prosperity. It’s a shame that Democrats 
chose to leverage the outbreak to include their 
agenda instead of focusing on the need of the 
nation. 
Congress failed to consider historical exam-
ples of relief proffered to American citizens. 
We can learn of the ineffectiveness of direct 
payments by examining the record of direct 
stimulus payments on behavior. 
The federal government has sent direct 
stimulus payments to individuals or house-
holds on three separate occasions, in 2001, 
2008, and 2009. The 2001 and 2008 direct 
stimulus payments were tax rebates of varying 
sizes offered to the overwhelming majority of 
individuals or households filing an IRS tax re-
turn in 2000 or 2007, respectively (which ac-
counts for approximately 86 percent of the 
population, both in 2008). 
In 2008, the year for which we have the 
best data, $96 billion was distributed to 83 
percent of filers (individuals or households at 
the highest income levels were not eligible for 
a rebate). 
The 2009 direct stimulus payments, unlike 
the 2001 and 2008 payments, were not meant 
to be nearly universal; instead, they were di-
rected primarily to the predominantly poor or 
elderly populations who may not have filed 
taxes in 2007 (or 2008). 
Stimulus checks in 2009 were paid directly 
out of various Social Security, Supplemental 
Security Income, Railroad Retirement, and VA 
accounts, instead of from the Treasury. 55 mil-
lion individuals received $14 billion from this 
stimulus. 
The maximum tax rebate in 2008 was 
$1,200 for joint filers, $600 for others, and an 
additional $300 per dependent. The 2009 
stimulus payments were $250 per recipient. 
A 2010 National Bureau of Economic Re-
search survey (Sahm, Shapiro, and Slemrod) 
found that only 23 percent of individuals or 
households receiving a 2008 stimulus check 
indicated they would ‘‘mostly spend’’ it. 24 per-
cent of those surveyed indicated they would 
‘‘mostly save’’ the money, and 53 percent said 
they would ‘‘mostly pay off debt’’ with the 
funds. 
The study also found that about 26 percent 
of families with incomes above $75,000 
planned to spend the 2008 rebate, as com-
pared to about 19 percent of lower-income 
families. 
Congress did not even discuss the ramifica-
tions of the direct payment program, ‘‘Eco-
nomic Impact Payments.’’ The advocates for 
direct payments exhibited hope and ignored 
the economic reality revealed in past efforts. 
A number of my colleagues and I put for-
ward a number of alternatives to the bound-
less spending package that would have pro-
vided immediate and lasting relief without 
causing potentially long-term harm to our 
economy. 
Only a few of the following proposals were 
incorporated into the CARES Act. All of them 
have advantages and disadvantages, but they 
all warranted far more consideration than they 
received: 
Payroll tax holiday: This is the original 
Trump administration plan. The advantage is 
that it helps individuals who are the biggest 
aggregate contributors to the economy. On the 
other hand, it does less to (directly) help poor-
er workers, workers in tip-dependent indus-
tries, and retirees. 
Temporary 
deregulation 
‘‘Require 
every 
agency within one month to identify and sus-
pend significant regulations that will reduce 
cost in the American economy—both compli-
ance costs and economic social costs. Upon 
approval by the President, such regulations 
(except those needed to protect human health 
and safety) shall be suspended until the Presi-
dent (or Congress) determines that the sus-
pension is no longer needed to provide relief 
of the economic crisis. Notice and Comment 
and other APA provisions shall not apply to 
the suspension of the regulations, but shall 
apply to the re-establishment of the regula-
tions. (This will reestablish the President’s 
goal of eliminating two regulations for every 
new regulation.)’’ 
From Club for Growth’s Policy Options for 
the Senate in Replacing the Pelosi/Mnuchin 
Coronavirus Stimulus with Economic Free-
dom that protects the American Economy: 
Prepayment of tax refunds: Give every 
household a refund of $5,000—roughly equal 
to the average refund for the 2019 and 2020 
tax years combined. This refund could gradu-
ally be recouped through the withholding of 
future refunds or by setting surcharges once 
the economy improves (perhaps after 2022). 
Idea from the American Enterprise Insti-
tute: 
Reduction of the pass-through tax rate: 
The businesses that are going to be hit hard-
est during the corona virus crisis are small 
firms of fifty or fewer employees, which 
make up a majority of businesses in the East 
Valley and most other parts of the country. 
We could advocate for your ‘‘Small Business 
Prosperity Act’’ (H.R. 4947) or even more ag-
gressive measures. 
Modification of the net operating loss 
(NOL) assessment: The TCJA eliminated 
‘‘carrybacks’’ 
and 
permitted 
unlimited 
‘‘carryforwards’’ of NOLs instead. New policy 
could 
once 
again 
allow 
businesses 
to 
carryback to more profitable times, or, al-
ternatively, it could allow firms to draw 
down NOLs by making them refundable. 
Elimination of paid-leave mandates: Sen-
ator Johnson tried unsuccessfully to amend 
the second coronavirus relief bill to strip its 
paid-leave mandates. His argument was that 
most small business owners are primarily 
concerned with preserving liquidity and 
guaranteeing their future solvency. Paid- 
leave mandates could inadvertently force 
some of these rattled small businesses to lay 
off workers permanently. Most senators who 
opposed the second coronavirus package did 
so on these grounds. 
Protection of industries from regulatory 
takings: Allow businesses forced to close or 
pare back operations (i.e. airline companies, 
restaurants) due to government mandates a 
reprieve from regulatory takings via tem-
porary, interest-free loans provided by the 
Treasury. 
Expansion of tax deductions and/or credits 
for individuals who work from home: The 
coronavirus 
may 
spur 
more 
permanent 
changes in workforce behavior. In addition 
to expanding existing tax deductions for in-
dividuals who work from home, policy-
makers could make them more flexible to 
account for any ‘‘gig’’ work that individuals 
may be forced to take on in the short-term. 
Expansion of tax deductions and/or credits 
for individuals who start a business: Some 
entrepreneurial individuals may see the cur-
rent crisis as an opportunity to leave their 
current jobs entirely and start their own 
businesses. 
Pausing of foreclosures/evictions/reposses-
sions for homeowners, business owners, and 
car owners: State governments are already 
starting to take the lead on this issue in 
many places, and the Trump administration 
has started to act at the federal level 
through executive order. 
Expansion and streamlining of the SBA 
disaster loan program: ‘‘The Small Business 
Administration (SBA) disaster loan program 
for those impacted by the coronavirus should 
be immediately made available nationwide, 
eliminating 
the 
complex 
and 
time-con-
suming local certification processes. The 
SBA also should be given the authority to 
streamline its disaster-loan approval process 
for amounts below $350,000 in order to pro-
vide emergency capital more quickly. This 
should include removing the requirement 
that small businesses demonstrate that they 
cannot access credit elsewhere before turn-
ing to the SBA. These loans may be used to 
pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable, 
and other bills that can’t be paid because of 
the virus’s impact. The interest rate is 3.75 
percent for small businesses and 2.75 percent 
for non-profits.’’ 
From the U.S. Chamber of Commerce: 
Additionally, because the relief packages, 
Phases 1, 2, and 3, all were ostensibly passed 
to provide relief due to the impacts of the 
COVID–19 outbreak, I and my colleagues rec-
ommended some of the following measures 
dealing with health policy. Be forewarned 
that my Democrat colleagues will attempt 
to reinstate Obamacare and its plethora of 
regulations. The policies set faith would be 
helpful in addressing the virus outbreak and 
would make the entire medical system more 
favorable to consumers and providers: 
Expansion of Health Savings Accounts: We 
should make it even easier for consumers to 
use pre-tax dollars on a wide range of serv-
ices. Some new guidance has already been re-
leased by the IRS in the wake of the 
coronavirus outbreak.

THANK YOU TO WASHINGTON 
STATE’S EDUCATORS 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to sincerely thank the teachers, 
paraeducators, food service workers, bus driv-
ers, custodial staff and others keeping the 
education of kids on track in Washington state 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Schools are always adapting to suit the 
needs of their students. When Washington 
state closed schools to prevent the spread of 
COVID–19, education professionals rapidly 
adjusted to on line education, ensuring stu-
dents would not fall behind. 
Distance learning has forced schools to 
tackle serious student equity issues, including 
access to technology and broadband, and 
making sure thousands of students who rely 
on school meals do not go hungry. These 
educators need Congress to step up to help 
address these issues. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the sac-
rifices teachers and school employees of all 
kinds across Washington state are making to 
provide for their students amid this public 
health crisis. And I call on Congress to provide 
necessary tools for school districts to ensure 
equitable online learning and sufficient re-
sources for students during this pandemic and 
beyond.

TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 748 con-
tains a critical provision that will be used to 
assist state and local governments in their re-
sponse to the crisis engulfing our nation. In-
deed, local governments are bearing the 
heavy burden of response with dwindling re-
sources while helping terrified Americans man-
age as best they can. As the entities closest 
to the ground, these local governments are on 
the front line of the fight, and we must ensure 
they have adequate funding. 
This provision, Section 5001 of the CARES 
Act, provides that Treasury will provide assist-
ance directly, and not through the State inter-
mediary to units of local government with 
more than 500,000 people. The provision, al-
lows for a significantly broad definition of local 
governments and specifies that ‘‘[t]he term 
‘unit of local government’ [includes] . . . other 
unit of general government below the State 
level with a population that exceeds 500,000.’’ 
Section 5001 explicitly allows any government 
that represents more than 500,000 and in-
cludes regional councils of government which 
are chartered under state law. 
In Ohio, Chapter 167 of the revised code 
provides broad authority for a regional council 
of government to act as a local unit of govern-
ment, to plan, enter cooperative agreements 
related ‘‘to matters affecting health, safety, 
welfare, education, economic conditions, and 
regional development.’’ See Ohio Revised 
Code, Sec. 167.03. 
In drafting and approving H.R. 748, the 
House and Senate intended section 5001 to 
be administered liberally, and for Treasury and 
the Courts to construe the statute broadly so 
as to encompass all local government entities 
with more than 500,000 citizens to act directly, 
and not through the intermediary of a state 
government. In fact, the State of Ohio has 
specifically devolved local authority to the re-
gional council of governments to act in the 
general welfare interests of their citizens as a 
unit of general government. 
As Treasury promulgates regulations to im-
plement this statute, the law intends for these 
regional councils of government to act as a 
general unit of local government, and envi-
sions them to be eligible to certify and receive 
the state stabilization dollars.

TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BRAD SHERMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, over 122,000 
cases of coronavirus, otherwise referred to as 
COVID–19, have been confirmed in the United 
States since the inception of the outbreak, in-
cluding more than 5,000 confirmed cases in 
my home state of California alone. More than 
two thousand Americans have died as a result 
of the virus, and many more stand to do so if 
we do not act quickly to mitigate its spread 
and address the myriad of medical challenges. 
While Congress has passed several meas-
ures to provide significant amounts of money 
for research activities at federal agencies, this 
is not enough. I am disappointed that H.R. 
748 does not adequately fund nor provide in-
centives for, research and development into 
treatments and vaccines that leverage the ex-
pertise of the public and private sectors. Chief-
ly, the CARES Act fails to adequately support 
research on the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) campus and at clinical research institu-
tions across the country to pursue all reason-
able avenues to develop treatments for the 
coronavirus, including diagnostic tests, thera-
pies and vaccines. The NIH should have sig-
nificantly more than $945 million to carry out 
COVID–19 related research and should also 
be directed to focus primarily on those pos-
sible treatments that are not subject to a pat-
ent and thus are not the focus of U.S. phar-
maceutical companies. 
Finally, the Trump administration uses this 
must-pass relief bill to advance their anti-re-
production rights agenda. The bill gives the 
Small Business Administration broad discre-
tion to exclude Planned Parenthood affiliates 
and other non-profits serving people with low 
incomes and deny them benefits under the 
new small business loan program. Addition-
ally, the bill attaches a harmful Hyde Amend-
ment provision to a state stabilization fund for 
state, local, and tribal governments providing 
coronavirus relief. Reproductive health care is 
essential health care, and Planned Parent-
hood health centers are a critical component 
of the health care system. Attempting to limit 
access to reproductive health care services 
during a pandemic will only worsen the public 
health care crisis.

TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NEAL P. DUNN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, oftentimes, when 
both sides of the aisle acknowledge that a bill 
is not perfect, it ultimately means it is actually 
quite good. With that said, I do want to high-
light some specific concerns that I have with 
provisions in this bill, both in their direct ef-
fects, and also the future precedent that they 
may set. 
Historically there is little evidence that direct 
to consumers stimulus checks have a signifi-
cant impact on the economy or that they lead 
to the kind of spending necessary to counter-
act an economic downturn. The Economic 
Stimulus Act of 2008 (signed February 13, 
2008) provided $600 checks to individuals and 
cost $168 Billion. A study by the Bureau of 
Labor statistics later showed that, ultimately, 
nearly 70 percent of recipients either used the 
money to pay off existing debt, or simply put 
it into savings. Those are not activities that 
stimulate the economy, and unsurprisingly that 
effort failed to stop a four percent contraction 
in GDP, the loss of over eight million jobs, and 
the worst overall economic disaster since the 
great depression. Overall, I believe that this 
bill will help us to avoid the same fate, but that 
will be due to other more robust provisions 
that acknowledge the importance of our small 
businesses and job creators in the private sec-
tor. 
The incentive and ability for anyone, regard-
less of their circumstances, to work hard and 
improve their life is a fundamental tenet of the 
American dream. It is essential that we do not 
allow this stimulus payment to serve as a pilot 
program for a Universal Basic Income, as 
some have suggested. Furthermore, it is true 
that this bill will at times create a situation 
where some people could actually earn more 
money by filing for unemployment if fur-
loughed than they would by staying in the 
workforce. We must acknowledge the potential 
for this to set a damaging precedent. 
This bill provides robust funding for our na-
tion’s hospitals and some needed flexibility in 
the telehealth space to ensure Americans, 
particularly seniors, are able to visit with their 
doctors in the lowest risk setting possible. I 
was disappointed however in the lack of a

specific carve out that acknowledges the 
unique challenges faced by our rural hospitals, 
like the many that serve Florida’s second dis-
trict. I was also disappointed that the bill does 
not provide statutory relief for those who may 
not have video phone capabilities required to 
meet reimbursement criteria for telehealth vis-
its. It is my understanding and hope however, 
that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
services will be able to provide adequate guid-
ance to allow for ‘‘audio only’’ visits. 
I believe that the $9.7 Billion provided to 
Secretary Sonny Perdue to aid our agriculture 
industry is a good first start, but ultimately 
more resources will need to be made available 
in the near future. Recent volatility in the glob-
al trade markets and natural disasters, com-
bined with an already weakened Agriculture 
economy mean our producers need help now 
more than ever. It is my hope that we can pro-
vide additional relief to our farmers, ranchers, 
and foresters suffering from this crisis soon. 
Finally, in an effort to protect the safety of 
this legislative body, this bill was largely nego-
tiated by a few individuals within our leader-
ship and the Administration. Their work, espe-
cially given the fact that they willingly put their 
own health at risk, is commendable. However, 
this came at the cost of a lack of input from 
the vast majority of our constituents and led to 
the inclusion of funding priorities that should 
have been debated over the course of the reg-
ular appropriations process. Programs like the 
National Endowment for the Arts, Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting, Institute of Museum 
and Library Services, and the Kennedy Center 
total hundreds of millions of dollars in this bill. 
We must ensure that any future relief package 
is entirely focused on the Coronavirus relief, 
and that vital resources are directed in the 
most effective way possible.

MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019 
SPEECH OF 
HON. BRADLEY BYRNE 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 27, 2020 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in support of the CARES Act. The situa-
tion on the ground demands action, which we 
must provide today. 
Last week, 3.3 million Americans filed for 
unemployment. Small businesses around this 
country are shuttering. Millions of Americans 
and their children are at home practicing so-
cial distancing, a term that few knew 2 weeks 
ago. Countless others are on the front lines in 
our hospitals, doctors’ offices, and pharmacies 
or simply checking us out at the grocery store. 
The American people need our help. 
No region or section of the economy has 
been spared by this pandemic but South Ala-
bama, which I represent, has been particularly 
hit hard. Millions of Americans come here 
every year to enjoy the weather, the beaches, 
and our southern way of life during the March 
and April Spring Break seasons. This all 
changed overnight. Countless small business 
owners have lost one of their busiest times of 
the year, and thousands of hard-working Ala-
bamians have been let go from their job 
through no fault of their own. 
The Constitution states that private property 
shall not be taken for public use without just 
compensation. This principle guides my sup-
port of this bill today. In essence, the govern-
ment has asked our nation’s businesses and 
workers to shoulder the burden of economic 
shutdown, during good times, for the wellbeing 
of the country. For that reason, it is fair and 
just that we provide them a lifeline to help 
them weather this storm. 
The situation is truly dire. Many small busi-
nesses are weeks or days away from deplet-
ing their cash reserves. When these small 
businesses close, rarely do they reopen. Thus, 
if we do not act, the economic devastation 
caused by extreme social distancing could 
plague communities for years. 
Yesterday, I spoke to many small busi-
nesses in my district on a call. I was struck 
when one asked me to give them hope. To 
the American people who are watching, there 
is hope, and the help you need is on the way. 
To small business owners, I say there is no 
more important provision in this bill than the 
Paycheck Protection Program. Through this 
program or nation’s small businesses and 
501(c)(3) nonprofits will be able to obtain a 
new 100 percent federally backed loan at an 
attractive interest rate. These loans will feature 
an automatic deferral for 6 months. 
Most importantly, if the small business or 
non-profit uses their Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram loan to cover their payroll, rent, mort-
gage interest, or utilities during an eight-week 
period, the loan will be forgiven. The only re-
quirement for this forgiveness is for employers 
to maintain their payroll or hire their workers 
back. Thus, we have effectively said to these 
hurting small businesses, don’t close your 
doors and keep your employees. And, if you 
do those things, which are necessary for us to 
exit the crisis quickly and effectively, we will 
give you a grant. 
Congress specifically wrote this program to 
utilize the existing SBA 7(a) loan program. Un-
like SBA disaster loans, these loans are gen-
erated by private banks, credit unions, and 
other lending institutions. We did this purpose-
fully. We don’t want bureaucrats at the SBA 
holding things up. We want the banks and 
credit unions you trust to get the money out to 
you as quickly as possible. 
For our nation’s workers who are struggling, 
we have provided enhanced unemployment 
benefits for those who have lost their job be-
cause of the coronavirus through no fault of 
their own. I strongly support this aid to help 
the millions who have been laid off and fur-
loughed get through this difficult time. 
Unfortunately, it is my fear that in our haste 
to help, we may have done real economic 
harm. Almost everyone supports enhanced 
unemployment benefits for those who have 
lost their job due to COVID–19, but by having 
a flat $600 benefit for many workers on top of 
their normal state benefit, we will put some 
workers in a better position to not work than 
they would have been had they not been laid 
off due to the pandemic. This could lead to 
employers increasing layoffs and could cause 
employees to fail to seek to work once the cri-
sis is abated. Not only is this a recipe for a 
government financed work disincentive, but 
the loss of these workers from the economy 
could strain our recovery. Basic economics 
should dictate to all of us that we should never 
make the cost of not working better than the 
cost of working. For that reason, I am deeply 
disappointed that the Democrats in the House 
and the Senate refused to provide for a simple 
fix to cure this issue. 
I am also disappointed that other special in-
terest and pork provisions crept into this bill at 
the last minute. The essential pieces of this 
legislation were ironed out almost a week ago, 
yet Democrats held up this important bill with 
a list of demands. Fortunately, most were re-
jected by negotiators from the Trump Adminis-
tration but some were included in the bill. 
At the request of House and Senate Demo-
crats, a number of pet projects received pork 
funding in this legislation. The American peo-
ple should know that Republicans fought these 
provisions. Yet, despite our best efforts to 
keep them out, funding for the Kennedy Cen-
ter, Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Am-
trak, and the Postal Service was included, 
among others. Additionally, at a time when 
employers are cutting back, new funds for 
Congressional staff and expenses were also 
added. This is disgraceful. Had the Speaker 
allowed an up or down vote on including these 
funds, they would have been stripped from the 
bill with bipartisan support. Yet, Washington 
as usual has resulted in their inclusion. The 
American people have a right to be angry 
about this pork. I hope there is bipartisan sup-
port to rescind it in the coming days. 
The provision of the bill designed to help 
mid-sized companies also contains several 
lines that—while they may seem innocuous— 
are special interest gifts to big labor. Specifi-
cally, the bill requires that employers maintain 
existing collective bargaining agreements al-
ready in place and requires neutrality in any 
attempt to unionize. Changing times call for 
changing agreements between management 
and labor. By locking existing collective bar-
gaining agreements in place, we put the 
thumb on the scale of labor to the detriment 
of the health of the business. More fundamen-
tally, ‘‘neutrality’’ in organizing means allowing 
the union to talk to a business’s employees 
without the employer being able to present the 
other side of what unionization could mean to 
the employer. This is fundamentally unfair to 
employers and employees. 
These provisions will undoubtedly make cer-
tain industries and certain companies less like-
ly to apply for the assistance they need to 
maintain their workforce. It will also provide an 
unfair advantage to companies already union-
ized over those who are not and to areas of 
the country that have a heavy union presence. 
Union membership is declining nationwide. We 
don’t need a union bailout in a bill to help with 
the coronavirus recovery. 
Finally, I note the enormous price tag of this 
bill. We should all pause to think about over 
$2 trillion—the largest appropriations bill in the 
history of the Congress—being rung up on our 
nation’s credit card with little warning. I do not 
question the need for such a major economic 
rescue package but we cannot continue to 
borrow in good times with the idea that we will 
simply borrow even more in the bad. America 
must have a serious conversation about how 
much government we are willing to pay for. 
This crisis should show us that the inter-
national order for things that we have de-
pended on for decades is not more than a cri-
sis away from a collapse. Today it is a med-
ical supply collapse. Tomorrow it may be our 
debt. No party is without blame for our debt 
situation. Many things must change in the 
aftermath of this crisis, and we must ensure 
that our lack of fiscal responsibility is one of 
them. 
Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is there are 
many things in this bill I do not like. There are

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRED 
STARR 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Fred Starr of Greensboro, 
North Carolina. 
Fred was born on December 11, 1932 in 
Springfield, 
Massachusetts. 
He 
graduated 
from Trinity College in 1955 and went on to 
serve his country in the U.S. Army for two 
years. After more than a decade in sales and 
management positions, Fred eventually found 
his way to Thomasville Furniture Industries. 
He started there in 1974 and rose up the 
ranks to become President and CEO by 1982. 
He oversaw Thomasville Furniture Industries 
until 1998. 
Outside of being active in the furniture 
world, Fred was deeply involved with many 
different organizations in our community. 
Some of the positions he held included Presi-
dent of the Piedmont Triad Partnership, Vice 
Chairman of the University of North Carolina 
at Greensboro, board member of High Point 
University, board President of the Eastern 
Music Festival, and chairman of the North 
Carolina Shakespeare Festival. 
When thinking of the giants in the North 
Carolina furniture industry, Fred Starr is cer-
tainly at the top of the list. He had a significant 
impact on his community and on the state of 
North Carolina. His contributions will live on 
for years to come. 
Please join me in gratitude for Fred’s life 
and in praying for Sue, his wife of 62 years, 
and for the entire Starr family.

INTRODUCTION OF THE 
IMPROVING ACCESS TO JOBS ACT 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to introduce the Improving Access to Jobs 
Act along with my colleagues Congresswoman 
AYANNA PRESSLEY and Congressman MARK 
TAKANO. 
Americans are stuck in congestion, on 
crumbling roadways and transit systems, and 
are too often forced to travel further and fur-
ther for jobs because our system fails to pro-
vide safe and convenient choices other than a 
car trip. 
The Improving Access to Jobs Act requires 
that ‘safe and convenient access to employ-
ment’ is an added condition for States’ min-
imum standards for public roads—for both 
new construction and roadway improvement 
projects. 
States and metropolitan planning organiza-
tions will assess how the transportation sys-
tem connects people to jobs by auto, transit, 
bike, and pedestrian investments, and ensures 
new investments do not degrade transit, bike, 
and pedestrian access. 
The Improving Access to Jobs Act will also 
adjust the definition of access to incorporate a 
measurement of travel times, travel stress for 
active travel (bike and pedestrian), and cost 
for low-income travelers. 
I am glad that the Improving Access to Jobs 
Act is endorsed by Transportation for America 
(T4A), Sierra Club, National Resources De-
fense Council (NRDC), National Association of 
City Transportation Officials (NACTO), Envi-
ronmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC), 
Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. 
The Improving Access to Jobs Act will re-
connect our communities, enabling people to 
take shorter, more convenient trips, reducing 
congestion and emissions, and improving ac-
cess to jobs for all. 
I urge this body to swiftly pass this legisla-
tion.

THANK YOU TO WASHINGTON 
STATE’S FIRST RESPONDERS 
HON. RICK LARSEN 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 7, 2020 
Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to thank the 3,360 emergency 
medical technicians and paramedics, 7,190 
firefighters, and 9,670 police and sheriffs pa-
trol officers who are on the front lines in the 
fight against the COVID–19 pandemic in 
Washington state. 
While most workers are under stay at home 
orders, these Washingtonians go out into the 
field, risking exposure to a contagious and 
deadly virus in order to protect the public. 
The lack of personal protective equipment 
for public safety offers is unacceptable. I have 
spoken with first responders from my district 
who have contracted COVID–19 or been 
forced to self-isolate because of potential ex-
posure. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to express my grati-
tude for first responders and call on Congress 
to ensure firefighters, police officers, EMTs 
and paramedics have the personal protective 
equipment they need to do their dangerous 
jobs safely during the ongoing pandemic.
