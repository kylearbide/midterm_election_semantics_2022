MONDAY, MAY 18, 2020 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Master, the Father of us all, 
we thank You that, through Your Spir-
it, You have provided our legislative 
body with the talents and capabilities 
to fulfill Your purposes. 
May our Senators remember that 
this body has many parts, each making 
its distinctive contribution to the suc-
cess of the whole. As our lawmakers 
acknowledge and honor the value added 
by each Member of this body, unite 
them with faith, civility, courage, and 
gratitude. 
And, Lord, we pray for the first re-
sponders and healthcare workers, who 
stand on the frontlines during this 
global health crisis. 
We pray in Your unifying Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 45 seconds. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
GRADUATING CLASS OF 2020 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this 
time of year is typically spent cele-
brating students of all ages as they 
graduate on to their next endeavors. 
Most graduations have a different look 
this year due to the pandemic, but the 
occasion has not lost its significance. 
Graduations are a time to celebrate the 
hard work and dedication students put 
into their educations. 
I congratulate all Iowans who are 
graduating this spring as you begin 
new chapters in your lives. Barbara 
and I wish you all more years of con-
tinued success. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
COVID–19 pandemic continues to hold 
our Nation on high alert. 
More than 1.4 million Americans 
have been infected; more than 80,000 
lives have been tragically lost; and the 
livelihoods of tens of millions of work-
ing families have been turned upside 
down in what seems like the blink of 
an eye. Our Nation’s healthcare system 
has not been stressed by contagion on 
this scale in over a century, and unem-
ployment has not been this high since 
the Second World War. 
A new generation of American he-
roes—from medical professionals, to 
lab researchers, to grocery store work-
ers, to custodians and janitors, to com-
munity volunteers—has been called up 
to the frontlines to serve its neighbors 
and our country. So, for several weeks 
now, the Senate has counted ourselves 
among those ranks of essential work-
ers. They are showing up for our coun-
try, so we are showing up for them. 
With respect to the pandemic itself, we 
are conducting rigorous oversight of 
the Senate’s historic CARES Act res-
cue package and are helping to plan 
the pivot toward reopening. 
Last week, Chairman ALEXANDER and 
the Committee on Health, Education, 
Labor, and Pensions engaged with Dr. 
Fauci, Dr. Redfield, Admiral Giroir, 
and other top experts to discuss paths 
for schools and businesses to reopen, 
and numbers of our colleagues are join-
ing me and Senator CORNYN in think-
ing proactively about the issue of legal 
liability that could crush the recovery 
on the runway. We need strong legal 
protections to ensure that our historic 
recovery efforts are not drained away 
from healthcare workers, schools, and 
universities or small businesses in 
order to line the pockets of trial law-
yers. 
At the same time, we have kept our 
eye on the ball on other significant 
global challenges. Last week, on a bi-
partisan basis, the Senate reauthorized 
critical surveillance authorities for our 
national security professionals. We 
also made sure to include important 
new reforms to begin to address the 
abuses that marred the 2016 election,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2470 
May 18, 2020 
the disturbing details of which are con-
tinuing to come to light every day. Our 
action on that subject is not finished. 
Thanks to leadership from Senator 
RUBIO, we passed legislation to con-
tinue ratcheting up the pressure on the 
Chinese Communist Party. In this case, 
our bill will shed new light and impose 
new consequences for the egregious 
abuses against the Uyghur people and 
other Muslim minorities. We also con-
firmed well-qualified nominees to im-
portant roles at the National Counter-
intelligence and Security Center, the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the 
Department of Homeland Security, and 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. 
In other words, we have done more 
for the American people in 2 weeks on 
this side of the Capitol than the House 
of Representatives has done in the last 
2 months. In the two months that the 
House Democrats have spent away 
from their duty stations, they have 
seemingly given themselves just one 
assignment—to draft an enormous po-
litical messaging bill and brand it as 
coronavirus relief. 
Yet, even on this basis, they have 
failed. The 1,800-page doorstop that 
Speaker PELOSI dropped last week was 
appropriately greeted as the legislative 
equivalent of a standup comedy. There 
were tax hikes on small businesses in 
the midst of a small business crisis, 
and there were targeted tax cuts for 
the wealthiest people in the bluest 
States. There were two separate tax-
payer-funded studies on diversity and 
inclusion in the market for marijuana. 
In sum, it was a $3 trillion wish list 
slapped together in a clumsy effort to 
never let a good crisis go to waste—se-
rious work here in the Senate and par-
tisanship pointlessness over in the 
House. 
The Senate will stay on course and 
continue our serious work at this seri-
ous time. Tomorrow morning, our col-
leagues on the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs will hear 
from 
Secretary 
Mnuchin 
and 
Fed 
Chairman Powell on the latest status 
of the CARES Act implementation ef-
forts. The Homeland Security and Gov-
ernmental Affairs Committee will meet 
this week to consider the nomination 
of Brian Miller to serve as Special In-
spector General for the pandemic re-
covery programs. The Special Com-
mittee on Aging will be examining the 
challenges facing American seniors 
during this pandemic as both the virus 
itself and the social distancing meas-
ures take a heavy toll on older Ameri-
cans. Of course, we will continue to up-
hold our responsibilities beyond the 
scope of COVID–19. We will consider 
more nominations to the Federal Elec-
tion Commission and to the Federal 
bench. 
Tomorrow, our colleagues on the In-
telligence Committee will vote on re-
porting 
the 
nomination 
of 
JOHN 
RATCLIFFE to serve as Director of Na-
tional Intelligence. This role is essen-
tial for monitoring and countering 
evolving threats from Russia to China, 
to terrorist groups, and for ensuring 
the intelligence community’s impor-
tant work is not tainted by partisan 
bias or political weaponization. 
We have a busy week ahead of us. 
This pandemic is not going to defeat 
itself; a careful reopening will not plan 
itself; and our Nation’s other chal-
lenges are not about to politely step 
aside in the meantime. All kinds of 
American heroes across the country 
are tackling the coronavirus head on. 
We are going to do all we can to keep 
them safe and supported while they do.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Scott H. Rash, of Arizona, to 
be United States District Judge for the 
District of Arizona. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
for the third week in a row, the Repub-
lican majority in the Senate has no 
COVID-related business on the agenda. 
For the third week in a row, Leader 
MCCONNELL has scheduled zero votes on 
legislation having to do with the crisis. 
Senate Democrats have had to re-
lentlessly pressure our Republican col-
leagues to secure even the most rou-
tine oversight hearings on the pan-
demic. If we had not pressured them, I 
doubt there would be any hearings at 
all, and they are few and far between. 
The hearings will be the only work we 
will have done in the Senate on 
COVID–19 in the entire month of May, 
and the Republican majority has had 
to be pressured into doing even those. 
There are now more than 35 million 
Americans out of work through no 
fault of their own. Almost 1.5 million 
Americans are sick, and nearly 90,000 
have died. Yet Senate Republicans 
have decided to take the month off 
from the coronavirus. 
The American people may be won-
dering: What is the Republican-led 
Senate doing instead of addressing this 
urgent national crisis? What could be 
more pressing? What is the Republican 
Senate doing in the midst of the crisis? 
Well, Leader MCCONNELL has sched-
uled five rightwing judges for the floor 
of the Senate, and the Republican 
chairman of the Homeland Security 
Committee will be holding a hearing 
designed to slander the family of the 
President’s political opponent. Is the 
chairman of Homeland Security calling 
in FEMA to find out if our hospitals 
have enough PPE? No. He wants to 
echo Kremlin-backed conspiracy theo-
ries in order to go on a fishing expedi-
tion to smear Joe Biden’s son. 
We all know this is what the Presi-
dent focuses on instead of the COVID 
crisis, but must our Republican col-
leagues gamely follow such an absurd, 
diversionary, and untruthful agenda? I 
guess so. It is a shame. 
Even more shameful, the company 
that the Senator from Wisconsin wants 
to issue a subpoena for is voluntarily 
cooperating and providing relevant 
documents to the committee. Did you 
hear that? They want to make a big 
show of subpoenaing, but the company 
says it will cooperate. It is a show. It is 
a sham. It has nothing to do with 
COVID and everything to do with 
Kremlin-backed rumors that they want 
to use to divert attention from the 
President’s poor showing on COVID. 
The subpoena is just for show. It is not 
necessary because the company will co-
operate. It is a way to kick up dirt for 
exclusively partisan purposes. 
It would be bad enough if they were 
doing this when COVID–19 wasn’t rag-
ing, but with COVID–19 raging, to 
spend time doing this instead of focus-
ing on the way to get relief to people— 
unbelievable. It is a low point for that 
committee, a low point for the Senate. 
This is what is on the Senate Repub-
licans’ agenda in the midst of historic 
unemployment and a national crisis: 
five rightwing judges and the exploi-
tation—a show, mock hearing for par-
tisan mudslinging. America is in crisis, 
and 
Senate 
Republicans 
are 
rear-
ranging the Nation’s deck chairs and 
trying to put them in a political as-
sembly. 
The Chairman of the Federal Re-
serve, Jay Powell, appointed by Presi-
dent Trump, said last week that we are 
looking at the worst recession since 
World War II. Yesterday, Mr. Powell 
warned that layoffs would continue for 
several months and that unemploy-
ment could reach 20 or even 25 percent. 
He said: 
If we let people be out of work for long pe-
riods of time, if we let businesses fail unnec-
essarily, waves of them, there’ll be longer 
term damage to the economy. The recovery 
will be slower. The good news is we can avoid 
that by providing more support now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2471 
May 18, 2020 
Mr. Powell went on to encourage pol-
icymakers to provide greater assist-
ance to families and implement meas-
ures to keep workers in their homes. 
He also pointed out if State and local 
governments don’t receive additional 
aid, they will be forced to lay off public 
employees and cut back on public serv-
ices at the worst possible time. 
Mr. Powell is spot-on, and tomorrow, 
in the Senate Banking Committee, my 
Republican colleagues will have a 
chance to hear this critical message 
straight from the horse’s mouth, with 
Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Powell set to tes-
tify only after Senate Democrats had 
to push and push and push for such a 
hearing. We asked for it 3 weeks ago. It 
should have happened 2 weeks ago be-
cause the country is calling out for ac-
tion. Trump appointees are calling out 
for action. Governors across the coun-
try—Democratic and Republican Gov-
ernors—are calling out for action. 
When will my Republican colleagues 
hear the message? After all, there is no 
shortage of action the Senate could 
take. 
Millions of Americans are having dif-
ficulty receiving the expanded unem-
ployment insurance benefits that Con-
gress recently passed. Why aren’t Sen-
ate Republicans holding a hearing on 
why millions of our citizens aren’t get-
ting the aid we intended to provide in-
stead of these sham political show trial 
‘‘gotcha’’ hearings? 
Testing continues to be a major prob-
lem. A blockbuster report in the Wash-
ington Post last night says we are ‘‘far 
short of the [testing] number that most 
independent analysts say will be need-
ed to avoid another wave of death and 
illness.’’ The report described a con-
cerning shortage of PPE, nasal swabs, 
and reagents in nursing homes and 
other frontline settings. The report 
outlined another problem: There is a 
startling lack of awareness in many 
communities about the need to get 
tested. 
Why aren’t Senate Republicans fo-
cusing on these issues? These are life- 
and-death issues. They relate to peo-
ple’s health and people’s lives, and they 
relate to our economy getting well. 
Why isn’t President Trump leading a 
nationwide push to increase testing ca-
pacity and frequency and awareness? 
President Trump is so desperate to 
reopen the country as quickly as pos-
sible, but he refuses to roll up his 
sleeves and do the work that would 
allow us to do it safely. There is an 
anomaly here. He demands that people 
get back to work but doesn’t do his 
work to make sure we have testing, to 
make sure there are guidelines, to 
make sure this works correctly so that 
we don’t have a crisis a few months 
from now. 
House Democrats have put together a 
major bill that would provide urgent 
and necessary relief to the American 
people. My colleagues on the Repub-
lican side don’t have to like everything 
in it. They could easily say: Let’s sit 
down and negotiate. Let’s find some 
common ground. 
Instead, Leader MCCONNELL has said 
that Republicans have yet to feel ‘‘the 
urgency of acting immediately’’—Her-
bert Hoover redux. Instead, his party is 
slowly preparing legislation to give 
legal immunity to big corporations 
that put workers in dangerous situa-
tions. Is that the No. 1 problem on 
every American’s mind? Is that the No. 
1 problem of people who are losing 
their jobs, people who have small busi-
nesses that are going bankrupt, people 
who can’t feed their kids—protecting 
corporations from liability? 
This Republican Party is so, so out of 
touch with America. It is so off-kilter, 
so in obeisance to the hard right that 
they can’t even focus on a crisis when 
it is right before their eyes. 
We are confronted with a period of 
prolonged economic misery for mil-
lions of American workers and fami-
lies—Americans who, for the first time, 
are waiting in staggering lines at food 
banks, Americans who, for the first 
time, don’t know if they will be able to 
keep a roof over their heads, put food 
on the table or pay the rent. How long 
will it take—how long? How much eco-
nomic hardship—how much before Re-
publicans feel the urgency to act? 
STATE DEPARTMENT IG 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
last Friday night, in the dark of night, 
President Trump fired the inspector 
general of the State Department, Mr. 
Steve Linick. Mr. Linick, according to 
reports, had been investigating the 
misuse of public resources by Secretary 
Pompeo and the Trump administra-
tion’s arms sales to Saudi Arabia. 
Mr. Linick is now the fifth—yes, the 
fifth—inspector general to be fired by 
President Trump from his or her post 
in the last few months. They all shared 
one thing in common. They had the au-
dacity to do their jobs and speak the 
truth. They had the audacity to try 
and drain the swamp. 
What is Donald Trump’s reaction 
when he hears the truth? He fires the 
people who have spoken it. What kind 
of President is that? 
During 
normal 
times 
it 
is 
bad 
enough, but during a crisis, it is more 
awful. The Inspector General of the In-
telligence Committee delivered a whis-
tleblower report to Congress as re-
quired by law. For this, it seems, he 
was fired. 
It was through the work of the HHS 
inspector general the public learned 
the extent of the Trump administra-
tion’s failure to provide hospitals and 
medical workers with testing, PPE, 
and necessary personnel in the early 
days of the pandemic. She has been 
fired too. 
The inspector general for the Defense 
Department and the Transportation 
Department have been fired, as well, 
just as they were about to oversee 
parts of the administration’s response 
to COVID. 
Now it is Mr. Linick who was looking 
into potential wrongdoing at the State 
Department. 
The inspectors general are the watch-
dogs for our Federal agencies, making 
sure our government is working for the 
people. That is what they are there to 
do: Hold government accountable for 
waste and fraud and abuse. But if they 
actually do their jobs and say that the 
President is doing something wrong, he 
fires them. 
The President can’t handle the truth 
and will not tolerate oversight of his 
administration when truth speakers 
speak out. No other administration has 
come close to doing this. This Presi-
dent is so different, running almost a 
rogue administration that defies truth, 
that defies facts. Now five inspectors 
general have been fired all because 
they were doing their job, telling the 
truth, and trying to clean up the mess 
in Washington. 
We 
know 
this 
about 
President 
Trump, but where the heck are my Re-
publican colleagues in the Senate? My 
friends on the other side, especially the 
senior Senator from Iowa, have long 
defended and even sought to pass legis-
lation to further empower inspectors 
general. Well, the President has just 
fired a parade of independent watch-
dogs and given no legitimate expla-
nation for their dismissals. 
Is a mild rebuke the most my Repub-
lican colleagues can muster—a tweet? 
Some concerned statements? 
This is not the first time the Presi-
dent has fired an IG and failed to pro-
vide a sufficient explanation. So what 
are our Republican colleagues going to 
do about it? Nothing, it seems. Noth-
ing. They are so afraid of President 
Trump. They so cling—almost to his 
ankles—that when they know he is 
doing wrong, when they know he is hid-
ing the truth, they are afraid to say it. 
They shudder. 
I have never seen anything like it: a 
President who is so out of control with 
his party so in line behind him, march-
ing in lockstep. But when history looks 
back on this chapter, on President 
Trump’s purge of independent watch-
dogs during a time of national crisis, it 
will not give credit to Senate Repub-
licans who let the President off the 
hook with at most and only, at times, 
a polite slap on the wrist. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The legislative clerk proceeded to

HEROES ACT 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to discuss the 
House Democrats’ $3 trillion spending 
spree. 
The American people are at a point 
where they need a life preserver. In-
stead, Speaker PELOSI has just thrown 
them an anvil. 
It is absurd. Her COVID–19 proposal 
is pricey, partisan, and it is a pipe 
dream. It is a bloated bonanza of all of

her 
leftwing 
socialist 
projects. 
It 
weighs in at over 1,800 pages, but there 
is one glaring omission: House Demo-
crats 
forgot 
to 
help 
fight 
the 
coronavirus. 
This bill is NANCY PELOSI’s socialist 
Democratic dream, but it is a night-
mare for the American people. NANCY 
PELOSI
needs a very serious reality 
check. The far-left fantasy will never 
become law. It cannot pass the Senate. 
The country is trying to recover from 
the coronavirus. People are stressed. 
They are struggling. They are sacri-
ficing. They are suffering. They need 
help to survive the crisis. 
People have been living through 2 
months of lockdowns to slow the 
spread of the disease. While the infec-
tion rate has finally started to flatten, 
tragically, tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans have already died. More than 36 
million people have lost their jobs. 
People back home in my State of Wy-
oming and people who, I am sure, are 
back home in the Presiding Officer’s 
home State of Missouri—people all 
across the country know what we need 
to do. We need to get back to business 
safely. We need this disease behind us. 
We need our communities back, and we 
need it as soon as possible. 
Yet, as States reopen, incredibly, the 
Democrats are exploiting and pro-
longing the Nation’s pain. Why? It 
seems to me they are trying to do it for 
political gain. 
Joe Biden has called this deadly dis-
ease ‘‘an incredible opportunity . . . to 
fundamentally transform the country.’’ 
NANCY PELOSI agrees. The global out-
break, she said, is a ‘‘wonderful oppor-
tunity’’ according to the Speaker of 
the House. She cannot let a crisis go to 
waste. I have seen the video of Hillary 
Clinton saying that you do not want a 
crisis to go to waste. So what is NANCY 
PELOSI
doing? She is wasting the 
public’s time on a proposal that does 
not have a single chance in the world 
of becoming law. 
This bill really is a political payoff 
to NANCY
PELOSI’s constituency and 
her allies. Look at the wish list. Top-
ping the House Democrats’ $3 trillion 
liberal wish list is the great blue State 
bailout. It has $1 trillion to bail out 
very badly mismanaged Democrat-run 
States and local governments, sanc-
tuary cities, one after another. The bill 
rescues underwater blue State pension 
plans. It includes a tax cut to the 
wealthiest 1 percent who live in those 
specific States—Illinois, New York, and 
California. It is a windfall for wealthy 
taxpayers in Democrat-run States. 
That is not all. The bill provides di-
rect payments to illegal immigrants. 
Apparently they forgot about that in 
the last bill, so they put it in this one— 
direct payments to illegal immigrants. 
Astonishingly, there is not an addi-
tional dime for paycheck protection 
funds, not for the small businesses that 
we need to keep on the payroll, even 
though the paycheck protection plan 
has saved 50 million jobs already in 
America. 
The bill does want to seek to release 
prisoners from ICE detention centers, 
so NANCY PELOSI is focusing on that. 
But there is no liability protection for 
the small businesses that we need to 
get to reopen the country. That is not 
included in her bill. 
These mom-and-pop businesses in my 
State of Wyoming are facing an ava-
lanche of abusive lawsuits as they try 
to reopen. The Wyoming legislature ac-
tually addressed it in a special session 
on Friday. We need to address it as a 
nation. 
The proposal that Pelosi has put out 
abolishes State voter ID requirements 
and overrides State voting laws. It is 
all a part of her master plan for Fed-
eral control of State election laws. As 
a former attorney general, the Pre-
siding Officer understands clearly the 
importance of States having the pre-
eminent role in the election process, 
not the Federal Government. 
The Pelosi bill bales out the U.S. 
Postal Service, and it funds something 
that she calls environmental justice 
and does it to the tune of $50 million. 
How does that help in the fight of 
coronavirus? 
The proposal takes good care of the 
marijuana industry—absolutely—even 
though selling pot is still a felony in 
most States. I don’t know how that 
helps 
in 
the 
fight 
against 
the 
coronavirus. 
No matter. The Pelosi plan gives the 
cannabis business special access to cut- 
rate finance. In fact, her bill reads 
more like a marijuana measure than a 
pandemic package. That is because it 
includes 
the 
word 
‘‘cannabis’’ 
68 
times—more often than she mentions 
jobs, 
hiring—the 
important 
thing 
about getting our country open and 
getting our communities back. 
This Democratic socialist Christmas 
list just goes on and on—and the astro-
nomical price: $3 trillion. 
If enacted, this Pelosi package would 
be the largest waste of taxpayer dollars 
in U.S. history. It is the largest bill, fi-
nancially, ever passed in Congress. For-
tunately, it will never become law. 
Now, NANCY PELOSI must not realize 
that families all across America are 
having a hard time paying their bills, 
feeding their kids, paying the rent. She 
must not recognize that; otherwise, 
why would she put all of this money in 
all of these things—these priorities: 
payouts to sanctuary cities—how does 
that help us fight the coronavirus?—fa-
vorable financing to the marijuana in-
dustry, tens of millions of dollars for 
environmental justice. 
Keep in mind, much of the money 
from the bipartisan CARES relief pack-
age that Congress already passed, 
money that has been appropriated, has 
not yet been spent. In March, Congress 
approved nearly $3 trillion in combined 
coronavirus aid. 
Lots of it has gone to States. My 
home State of Wyoming just had a spe-
cial session of the legislature this past 
Friday-Saturday to see how we are 
going to go ahead spending the bil-
lions—$1.25 billion—that have come to 
so many States. And Wyoming—while 
there are a number of other States 
smaller in size—got the lowest amount 
of money. They haven’t spent it. They 
are having a special session to decide 
how to spend it. Some States may need 
more flexibility in spending it. But 
NANCY PELOSI is trying to send out an-
other trillion dollars to States and to 
cities. 
As a Republican, I would say, from 
the start, our focus has been on helping 
people through the health and eco-
nomic crisis that is upon us. We want 
to help the American people weather 
the storm. 
Now, when House Democrats say that 
NANCY PELOSI lays down a marker—as 
she says—for future bipartisan talks, 
in reality, Democrats are only weak-
ening their position by betting big 
against the American economic recov-
ery. That is what they are doing in the 
bill that they put together because the 
Pelosi bill includes specific what I be-
lieve 
are 
job-killing 
proposals—not 
things to help more Americans work 
but things making it harder for Ameri-
cans to get back to work. 
This bill would slow the recovery by 
keeping millions of Americans on the 
government payroll all the way into 
2021. The Presiding Officer has been a 
leader in this fight about perverse in-
centives that we see in some of the leg-
islation that has already passed. 
This bill, this fantasy island that 
NANCY PELOSI is on, extends increased 
unemployment benefits so people could 
make more money by not working than 
by going back to work. Now, that 
means as much as half of the workforce 
could earn more by not working than 
by returning to work all the way into 
2021. 
So the Democratic socialists want 
the businesses that are trying to re-
open and to rehire workers to compete 
with unemployment benefits until 2021, 
until April of next year. The Demo-
crats are proposing that these Amer-
ican businesses—instead of hiring 36 
million Americans who are out of 
work, they want to make it easier for 
them to hire illegal immigrants than 
the Americans who are currently out of 
work. That is what she has set up in 
her scheme. 
The bill also raises taxes on strug-
gling small businesses. It mandates 
paid family leave through the end of 
2021 and removes a small business tax 
exemption. 
It is as if Democrats don’t want the 
economy to reopen and don’t want peo-
ple to return to work. That is what I 
see when I read through the 1,800 pages. 
Before the pandemic hit, we had 
record job growth, record low unem-
ployment, and record-high consumer 
confidence. Now, unemployment is ap-
proaching the level of the Great De-
pression. 
The best way to help the 36 million 
people who are out of work is to reopen 
our communities and reopen our coun-
try. It is telling that House Democrats’

$3 trillion bill includes no measures to 
help Americans get back to work, no 
added support for hard-hit small busi-
nesses, and no protections for Amer-
ican jobs. 
Congress will be considering pro-
viding 
more 
virus 
aid 
in 
coming 
months and weeks. Any recovery legis-
lation will have to be targeted, tem-
porary, and tailored to address the 
coronavirus emergency. 
COVID–19 legislation must include 
reasonable, responsible liability pro-
tections for healthcare providers and 
for employers, for the small businesses 
in our States, and it needs to promote 
economic jobs and growth. 
Now, Senate Republicans are focused 
on reopening America. The American 
taxpayer can’t be asked to pay for 
items on Speaker PELOSI’s $3 trillion 
socialist Christmas list. The American 
people need us to throw them a life pre-
server, not the anvil that NANCY 
PELOSI has thrown their way. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER.

The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
after every natural disaster, after 
every major emergency, there is al-
ways a period of response—that initial 
triage. Think about performing search 
and rescue operations, providing med-
ical care, and setting up emergency 
shelters. You are moving quickly to 
complete these time-sensitive tasks to 
get everyone to safety and minimize 
the loss of life. 
At some point, though, you begin to 
transition to recovery—clearing the de-
bris, restoring power, rebuilding, and 
eventually trying to return to life as 
normal. As always, there will be a pe-
riod of transition between those peri-
ods in which you continue to focus on 
the short-term response while you plan 
for the longer term recovery. While we 
face a much different type of crisis 
today, I believe the same principles 
apply. 
Our heroic healthcare workers con-
tinue to respond to this virus on the 
frontlines. Our farmers, our ranchers, 
our truckers, our grocery store em-
ployees, and food banks are ensuring 
people have food on their tables. The 
mailmen, delivery drivers, waste col-
lectors, and other workers in critical 
sectors are keeping the cogs of our so-
ciety and our economy running, and 
slowly but surely, recovery is hap-
pening too. 
In Texas and other States across the 
country, businesses are welcoming cus-
tomers through their doors for the first 
time in a while. Parks are beginning to 
reopen, and schools are making plans 
for the fall. Every day, the needle is 
moving in a positive direction, but I 
am worried that, without some protec-
tions for these workers, these busi-
nesses, these churches, and these food 
banks, we are going to reverse course 
or stop them dead in their tracks. We 
are already seeing lawsuits piling up 
that claim somebody did this or did 
that in a corona-related incident. Un-
fortunately, there is an economic in-
centive to use as a cash cow the virus 
that has infected some 1.5 million Tex-
ans, and we are setting up for what 
could be one of the biggest bonanzas in 
history in terms of litigation. 
You had better believe that those 
who could find themselves on the re-
ceiving end of these lawsuits are tak-
ing notice. A recent survey by the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Busi-
ness found that nearly 70 percent of 
small business owners are concerned 
about liability claims and that hos-
pitals are cautious about resuming pro-
cedures, like organ transplants or can-
cer biopsies, because they could get 
sued as well. Even if you have done ev-
erything the public health officials say 
you should do and even if you have ac-
commodated every request that the 
President, the Governor, or the mayor 
has made, you could still be sued. Even 
if businesses and hospitals follow all of 
the relevant guidelines and act in good 
faith, they could end up fighting very 
long and very expensive lawsuits. They 
could end up winning those lawsuits, 
but they could also end up going bank-
rupt in the process because defending a 
lawsuit is not cheap. At a time when 
we want people to focus like a laser on 
reopening their businesses and refilling 
these jobs, we can’t allow that incen-
tive for a lawsuit lottery to bleed our 
health workers dry and deter our re-
covery. 
Congress needs to take action to pre-
vent these opportunistic lawyers from 
using this crisis to make money and to, 
at the same time, hurt our economy 
and hurt our recovery. Leader MCCON-
NELL and I and others are working on a 
proposal that would put commonsense 
reforms in place and protect those who 
act in good faith from being sued into 
oblivion. I want to be absolutely clear 
about the goals of this legislation. 
There is no effort to pass a blanket im-
munity. There is no effort to protect 
bad actors who willingly put their pa-
tients, their employees, or customers 
in danger. What we are talking about is 
temporary and targeted liability pro-
tection for those who act in good faith 
and follow all of the relevant public 
health guidelines and direction. 
First, we must protect the healthcare 
workers who are on the frontline of 
this crisis. These men and women have 
made tremendous physical and mental 
sacrifices while serving during this un-
precedented time, and we simply can’t 
allow them to be taken to the cleaners 
by those who are looking for a payout. 
More than a dozen States have al-
ready 
provided 
protections 
for 
healthcare workers by raising the 
threshold for medical malpractice law-
suits. The Democratic Governor of New 
York, Andrew Cuomo, has issued an ex-
ecutive 
order 
granting 
healthcare 
workers immunity from civil liability. 
Let me make sure people get this. The 
Democratic Governor of New York has 
issued an executive order granting 
healthcare workers immunity from 
civil liability. Again, this is not a blan-
ket immunity. There are exceptions for 
gross negligence and willful conduct. 
If limiting liability makes sense in 
New York, then I think it certainly 
makes sense elsewhere. We need to pro-
vide the same level of protection for 
healthcare 
workers 
all 
across 
the 
United States so they can operate 
without fear of having to defend them-
selves in lawsuits when they are doing 
their very best, in a time of crisis, to, 
in good faith, follow all of the appro-
priate guidance. Yet we can’t stop 
there. We have to provide similar pro-
tections for the workers, the busi-
nesses, the schools, the nonprofits, and 
other institutions that are critical to 
our recovery. 
Think about small business owners— 
70 percent of whom I know are worried 
about liability lawsuits, which is ac-
cording to the National Federation of 
Independent Business. Once they re-
ceive the green light to open their 
doors, they have to make a very impor-
tant decision: Is it worth the risk? 
Let’s say that you are a restaurant 
owner who has gone through the CDC’s 
newly released decision tree for res-
taurants and bars and that you are pre-
pared to implement all of the rec-
ommended health and safety actions as 
well as to monitor your staff. There is 
nothing stopping the first person who 
walks through the door from suing you 
in a few weeks because one believes one 
contracted the virus at your res-
taurant. It is not just businesses that 
are facing these types of decisions. Any 
nonprofit organization or agency that 
serves the public is in a similar posi-
tion, even if it has gone to great 
lengths to comply with public health 
recommendations. 
As our public schools, colleges, and 
universities weigh decisions about re-
opening this fall, liability protections 
are going to play a major factor. Last 
week, the Committee on the Judiciary 
held a hearing on liability protections. 
One of the witnesses we heard from was 
Lee Tyner, who serves as the general 
counsel for Texas Christian University 
in Fort Worth, TX. In his testimony, 
Lee called this the ‘‘cliff problem.’’ He 
said that this is what his University of 
Virginia law school professor used to 
describe as being an uncertain standard 
of care. A liability cliff is some sort of 
line that would be catastrophic to 
cross. 
If you know where that cliff is, you 
are able to make good decisions about 
how far you are willing to go and what 
kind of risks you are willing to take, 
but if you do not know exactly where it 
is, then uncertainty will likely lead 
you to avoid the area altogether. In

this case, as Lee pointed out, our coun-
try needs our colleges and universities 
to walk toward the cliff but not to go 
over it, just as we need healthcare 
workers, businesses, nursing homes, 
and nonprofits to do the same. Yet we 
can’t ask them to do it blindly or in 
the dark or without providing the 
needed clarity so that they can manage 
their risks. 
I think what is so different about 
this pandemic is that people get so 
much contradictory and conflicting in-
formation from a variety of sources. 
Most of us know how to manage risk in 
our lives, but it is hard to manage un-
certainty, and that is what we are ask-
ing the Senate and the Congress to do 
is to provide some certainty in the 
midst of this uncertainty. These work-
ers and institutions are critical to 
helping our response and recovery 
move forward, and we can’t ask for or 
expect them to make decisions without 
having some level of certainty. They 
need to know with confidence that, if 
they are operating in good faith and 
obeying the public health and other 
government guidelines, that they will 
not inadvertently step over the edge of 
the cliff and find themselves in free 
fall. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
SAFEGUARDING AMERICA’S FIRST RESPONDERS 
ACT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
come to the floor to discuss a piece of 
legislation that Senator BOOKER and I 
worked on to help public safety offi-
cers. 
Since the COVID–19 pandemic began, 
over 100 first responders have lost their 
lives to this virus. Unlike the rest of 
us, these brave men and women, by the 
very nature of their work, haven’t been 
able to stay home or social distance. In 
firehouses across the country, fire-
fighters have had to continue sharing 
confined spaces and respond to emer-
gencies in cramped trucks. Police offi-
cers have had to continue to respond to 
911 calls and also interact with the 
public in very close quarters. While 
most of us are avoiding COVID at all 
costs, State and county EMT crews 
have been transporting the infected 
and others to hospitals for emergency 
care. 
While I am inspired by the bravery of 
these first responders, I am not at all 
surprised by the actions they take to 
protect the people they serve. First re-
sponders always answer the calls to ac-
tion, selflessly placing others before 
themselves. So, in recognition of the 
many sacrifices they make, Congress 
established the Public Safety Officers’ 
Benefits Program a long time ago, in 
1976. This law provides first responders 
with onetime payments if they die or 
are totally disabled on duty. 
Let me be very clear. Nothing can 
ever put a family back together who 
has lost a loved one, but the Public 
Safety Officers’ Benefits Program pro-
vides some economic relief to grieving 
families and gives peace of mind to the 
first responders themselves in their 
knowing that their families will not be 
left destitute if tragedy is to befall 
them. 
Unfortunately, the Public Safety Of-
ficers’ Benefits Program wasn’t de-
signed to deal with a global pandemic 
of this type or magnitude that we were 
made aware of in the United States in 
late January. Under the existing stat-
ute then, to be awarded benefits, first 
responders had to be able to prove that 
they contracted COVID on duty. From 
the reports we get, it is kind of hard to 
tell where one comes in contact with 
it. So the last thing a grieving family 
needs to be worried about then, after 
experiencing the loss of a loved one, is 
whether the family will be able to suc-
cessfully prove that its loved one con-
tracted COVID in the line of duty and 
that it qualifies for the loss of life 
under the 1976 law. 
Almost as soon as the nationwide 
stay-at-home order was instituted, I 
began working with Senator BOOKER to 
craft language to create a presumption 
that would allow families to receive 
benefits without having to prove that 
their loved ones contracted a deadly 
virus on duty. Senator BOOKER and I 
were determined to get this done as 
soon as possible because we understood 
that families who have lost loved ones 
will soon begin filing for benefits. We 
know that the number is about 100 at 
this point. 
Our bill is entitled ‘‘Safeguarding 
America’s First Responders Act,’’ or 
SAFR, pronounced ‘‘safer’’ for short. 
The bill was introduced on May 5, 
which was 1 day after the Senate re-
turned to session. 
This bill is the product of several 
weeks of friendly negotiations and 
input from fire groups and police 
groups. The bill garnered a total of 22 
bipartisan cosponsors, including the 
entire New York and New Jersey dele-
gations. Last Thursday, the Senate 
unanimously passed our bill. It now is 
in the House, where we hope it will re-
ceive immediate consideration. I know 
our colleagues in the House are deeply 
concerned about our first responders, 
and I would expect this to have a suc-
cessful effort over there. I have been 
working with Congressman PASCRELL 
and others on several other reforms for 
the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits 
Program, so I think it has been well re-
ceived over there by some outstanding 
people who can carry it to victory. 
There is no excuse for this bill not to 
receive a vote as soon as possible. It is 
the only bill of its kind that has the 
support of the International Associa-
tion of Firefighters, of the Inter-
national Association of Fire Chiefs, 
and of several State and Federal police 
groups. It was coauthored by Senator 
BOOKER and features the support of 11 
Democrats and 10 Republican Senators 
as original cosponsors, including the 
Senate minority leader. SAFR, this 
bill, also has the support of the Depart-
ment of Justice, which stands ready to 
pay out benefits to grieving families 
but is limited by statute as to what it 
can do under existing law—hence, the 
importance of this legislation. 
Simply put, this bill is a no-brainer. 
I urge Speaker PELOSI to schedule a 
vote on SAFR as soon as the House re-
turns to session. 
It is now my privilege to thank Sen-
ator BOOKER and to yield to my col-
league from New Jersey, who worked 
so hard to get this done as well. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, let 
me just say, right at the top, how 
grateful I am to stand on the Senate 
floor again with Senator CHUCK GRASS-
LEY. He has been one of the great part-
ners I have had in my short time in the 
Senate, and I am honored to have got-
ten a lot of good work done and good 
law passed. I thank him and his entire 
staff. They were all tremendous to 
work with and went above and beyond 
for us to get this done at a very quick 
pace. I thank our colleagues for acting 
with the urgency that this issue de-
mands. 
I am excited that this bill was able to 
pass, for it will ensure that the fami-
lies of first responders who lose their 
lives to the coronavirus will be taken 
care of under the Public Safety Offi-
cers’ Benefits Program. We expect now 
that over 100 of these death benefit 
claims will be submitted to the Depart-
ment of Justice in the coming days and 
weeks, and we cannot leave these 
grieving families to fight alone for the 
benefits they need and deserve. As Sen-
ator GRASSLEY very pointedly put it, 
we hope that the House of Representa-
tives will pick up this legislation for 
immediate consideration. 
While COVID–19 has changed daily 
life across this country, for so many of 
us, I am grateful that my colleague and 
so many of my colleagues understand 
that our firefighters, our EMTs, our po-
lice officers, and our other emergency 
service personnel continue to put their 
lives on the line to protect our commu-
nities and have done so at significant 
and increased risk to themselves and 
their families. 
In hard-hit areas across our Nation, 
we see first responders stepping up to 
enormous risk. Being a first responder 
during this pandemic is not a job; it is 
an all-consuming mission and, unfortu-
nately, a tremendous sacrifice. It is re-
sponding to a call and knowing that, 
just 
by 
stepping 
inside 
someone’s 
home, you are running a high risk of 
exposing yourself to the virus. It is 
wondering whether your personal pro-
tective gear—or PPE—that you have 
on is enough. In many cases, it is won-
dering whether your PPE is even real, 
with there being so many of our first 
responders, unfortunately, using what-
ever they can scrounge up. Whether it 
is the buying of foreign masks that are 
not designed for use in the United 
States or the buying of them from un-
known vendors, they are doing what 
they can to protect themselves as they 
go about their urgent mission.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2475 
May 18, 2020 
When they remove their PPE, there 
is a concern with their gloves or gog-
gles or gown as they take them off 
piece by piece. They strain to remem-
ber what they touched, washing their 
hands repeatedly but wondering and 
worrying if it is enough. When per-
forming 
lifesaving 
procedures 
like 
CPR, which may aerosolize the virus, 
you hope that the PPE you are wearing 
is enough to protect you. These are the 
daily, hourly, moment-by-moment con-
cerns our first responders have. 
Senator GRASSLEY has worked with 
first responders in so many ways, and 
he knows the challenges this brings, 
from having to meticulously clean 
every surface of an ambulance, clean-
ing the squad houses, police stations, 
knowing that the virus could be lin-
gering there, and when they are going 
home, undressing in the basement, ga-
rage, or even outside their homes, 
heading straight into the house for a 
shower but still worrying if it is 
enough to protect their family. 
We know that many of these first re-
sponders aren’t actually going home to 
their families. They are separating 
themselves for periods of time because 
they live in fear of spreading the dis-
ease to a spouse, child, or parent. 
There is emotional stress and strain 
when responding to a call, doing every-
thing they can to save someone from 
this virus. But we know our first re-
sponders are often seeing death in 
areas of the country at a rate and at 
levels that they have never experienced 
before. This all adds to the fear and 
anxiety, the worry about their fami-
lies, and the worry about their commu-
nities. 
Our first responders are doing what 
very few of us will ever have to do. 
They put their lives, their health, and 
often the health of their families on 
the line to protect their communities. 
They have always helped, but now, in 
the time of coronavirus, their sac-
rifices are intensified. 
The very least we can do is to ensure 
that they don’t have to worry about 
what will happen to their loved ones if 
something should happen to them. The 
Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Pro-
gram that Senator GRASSLEY
men-
tioned was created to provide death 
and disability benefits to families of 
law enforcement officers, firefighters, 
EMS, and other first responders who 
are killed in the line of duty. Their 
benefits come in the form of financial 
support, as well as educational scholar-
ships, for surviving spouses and chil-
dren. 
As Senator GRASSLEY said, it cannot 
replace the life that is lost, but it is 
something that could give comfort to 
those families and even to the first re-
sponders who themselves are being put 
in grave danger. 
Infectious disease is currently cov-
ered under the program, though the of-
ficer’s family or department is required 
to provide evidence that the disease 
they contracted occurred while on 
duty. Providing that evidence can be 
straightforward, when the first re-
sponder came into contact with a dirty 
needle, for example, and then was in-
fected by something that caused their 
death. 
The problem with COVID–19 is that it 
presents an entirely different chal-
lenge. While the Department of Justice 
works to ensure that families who have 
members who are killed by COVID–19 
are covered, we must eliminate the in-
stances when families are asked to 
prove what is unprovable, to prove that 
somehow they caught this while they 
were in the hours of their duties. This 
is why our bill makes urgently needed 
changes to the PSOB program to re-
flect the unique threat that COVID–19 
poses to first responders in putting 
their lives on the line in this crisis. 
Many first responders have already 
made the ultimate sacrifice. I am so 
grateful that Senator GRASSLEY men-
tioned that. In New Jersey alone, 29 
first responders have lost their lives to 
coronavirus just in the past 7 weeks. 
We know this crisis is ongoing in our 
country. 
The bill that CHUCK GRASSLEY and 
our team wrote creates a presumption 
that, if a first responder contracts 
COVID–19 during this pandemic and 
tragically dies, their death will be 
treated as a line-of-duty death without 
the need to affirmatively prove their 
illness was contracted while on the job. 
When this bill is passed by the House 
and signed by the President, this pre-
sumption will be retroactive to Janu-
ary 1, 2020. It will last until the end of 
2021. The bill ensures that the families 
of first responders have the support 
they need and deserve when they face 
unimaginable loss. 
Twenty-seven 
years 
ago, 
New 
Jerseyan John Careccia watched as two 
EMTs saved his son’s life. That same 
year, he became a volunteer EMT so 
that he could pay it forward. Since 
then, he has worked as an EMT and 
served as the chief and training direc-
tor at the Woodbridge Township Ambu-
lance and Rescue Squad in Woodbridge, 
NJ. 
John passed away on April 17, after 
contracting COVID–19. He is survived 
by his children, Toni, Roseanne, and 
John, and his 10 grandchildren. 
John’s loved ones shared in his obit-
uary that he ‘‘will be remembered for 
his contagious laugh, big heart and 
greeting you with ‘hey guy.’ He loved 
to spend time with his family and al-
ways had a story to tell. His favorite 
place to eat was the Reo Diner. He al-
ways chose to bring a chocolate cream 
pie for his dessert contribution to any 
family gathering.’’ 
His family asked that in lieu of flow-
ers being sent, ‘‘John would hope that 
you will perform an unexpected act of 
kindness for someone in his name.’’ 
Charles ‘‘Rob’’ Roberts joined the 
Glen Ridge, NJ, Police Department in 
2000. He lived in Glen Ridge with his 
wife, Alice. Together they raised their 
three children, Shea, Natalie, and 
Gavin, right there in Glen Ridge. 
Officer Roberts contracted COVID–19 
in the line of duty in April and was 
rushed to Mountainside Medical Center 
after being resuscitated in his home by 
his fellow officers and members of the 
volunteer ambulance squad. On May 11, 
Officer Roberts passed away at the age 
of 45. 
Last week, hundreds of residents of 
his town of Glen Ridge stood on their 
front lawns and sidewalks to pay trib-
ute to Officer Roberts’ life, his service, 
his love of community and family. 
In a New York Times article pub-
lished after his passing, many of Offi-
cer Roberts’ colleagues and neighbors 
shared stories about his kindness and 
his calm demeanor in the face of chal-
lenges. Quoting from the article: 
There was the couple who remembered how 
calm he was when he helped deliver their 
baby in their kitchen. 
There was the older woman, forever grate-
ful for the gentle way he held her hand when 
she broke her hip and they waited for an am-
bulance. And there was the father who strug-
gled with a difficult son and remembered 
how Mr. Roberts looked him in the eye and 
reassured him that his boy was a good kid. 
Officer Roberts’ father shared at his 
memorial that he ‘‘wanted to make 
others happy.’’ 
Israel ‘‘Izzy’’ Tolentino served in the 
U.S. Marine Corps before becoming a 
volunteer EMT and then a firefighter 
for the City of Passaic, NJ. Izzy con-
tracted COVID–19 in the line of duty 
and on March 31 passed away at the age 
of 33, the first New Jersey firefighter to 
be killed by the virus. 
Israel is survived by his wife, Maria, 
and 
their 
two 
children, 
daughter 
Ailani, age 9, whom he called his prin-
cess and his son Israel, age 7, whom he 
called his best friend. 
I would like to share a few words 
from an NJ.com article published in 
the wake of Izzy’s passing. 
Israel Tolentino was born to be a fire-
fighter. 
It wasn’t out of love of the uniform, 
though Tolentino beamed with pride every-
day he walked out wearing the Passaic Fire 
Department emblem. It wasn’t even out of a 
mountain of bravery or a penchant for run-
ning towards the flames. 
It was, his wife Maria Vasquez said, be-
cause he couldn’t help but be selfless. 
‘‘It fulfilled his urge to serve others,’’ said 
Vazquez, his wife of more than 10 years. ‘‘He 
was so selfless. It drew me closer to him. It 
drew everyone closer to him.’’ 
These are only 3 among the 29 heroes 
just from New Jersey. There are count-
less more first responders across the 
country who lost their lives in respond-
ing to this crisis. Some of their names 
we know, and some we will learn in the 
weeks and months to come. What we do 
know is, we owe it, as a nation, to their 
families and to the departments they 
served to be there for those families 
and to be there for those children. 
Their families and the families of all 
first responders across the country who 
have lost loved ones to this virus de-
serve to be taken care of. For their 
sake, I hope the House of Representa-
tives will act quickly to pass this legis-
lation and that the President will sign 
it into law.

S2476 
May 18, 2020 
Our first responders in this unprece-
dented global pandemic did not hesi-
tate or equivocate. They did their 
duty. They stood up and faced danger. 
They answered the call. We now must 
answer the call, and we must have 
their backs just as they had ours. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
KLAMATH AREA DROUGHT 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, at 
this moment, Americans everywhere 
are confronting unprecedented chal-
lenges and uncertainties as we con-
tinue to grapple with the coronavirus 
pandemic and the associated economic 
implosion. 
That is not all that is going on across 
the country. Although some of the 
challenges we face are quite severe, 
they are just getting drowned out by 
the daily news about the pandemic. 
But imagine being a family farmer in 
the midst of this crisis. You have al-
ready faced any number of challenges 
in recent years—low commodity prices, 
tariff wars—only to face the greatest 
health and economic disaster any of us 
have experienced in our lifetime. Then, 
when you thought nothing else could 
go wrong, something else does go 
wrong. You have to face a severe 
drought. Twelve hundred farms in the 
Klamath Basin in Oregon and Cali-
fornia don’t have to imagine this situa-
tion because they are living through it 
as we speak. 
The Klamath Basin is sometimes re-
ferred to as the ‘‘Western Everglades,’’ 
an area rich with agricultural re-
sources and exceptional populations of 
wildlife. This basin attracts 80 percent 
of the Pacific Flyway’s waterfowl and 
supports the largest overwintering pop-
ulation of bald eagles anywhere in the 
lower 48 States and is home to some of 
the country’s most productive salmon 
river systems in the country. 
It is also home to 1,200 family-owned 
farms of different sizes, encompassing 
some 200,000 acres of farmland. That 
farmland is irrigated with water from 
both the tributaries of the Klamath 
River and Klamath Lake. Those who 
are familiar with the basin will know 
that the water is essential to the 
health of the river, the health of the 
lake, the wildlife in the refuge, and the 
economic success of the ranchers and 
farmers. 
In many years, there is enough water 
to address all of these needs, but in 
other years, such as this year, 2020, 
there isn’t enough water to go around. 
So when there is a dry year with less 
water in the lake and river, it is bad 
for everyone—bad for the refuge, the 
river, the lake, and it is a horrific chal-
lenge for our ranchers and for our 
farmers. 
This year, 2020, isn’t just a dry year; 
it is ‘‘as difficult a year as anyone 
could have imagined,’’ according to 
Jeff Nettleton, Area Manager of the 
Bureau of Reclamation, Klamath Basin 
area office. 
As Governor Kate Brown put it back 
in March, ‘‘Drought conditions arrived 
early and have persisted, including re-
duced snowpack, precipitation, and 
minimal streamflow.’’ In other words, 
this is a perfect storm of challenges. 
The Governor went on to say that 
‘‘the long-term forecast for the region 
continues for warmer than normal 
temperatures and lower than normal 
precipitation.’’ There has been nothing 
in the 2 months since she said that 
which has reversed that course. 
As of last Friday, the snowpack in 
the Klamath region, the natural res-
ervoir that replenishes the lakes and 
streams providing water for the irriga-
tion system for the summer, was just 
28 percent of normal. 
You can get some sense of how bad 
the drought is this year by looking at 
the historic numbers on this chart. 
This is one way of presenting it. We 
can see deliveries that are coming to 
the Upper Klamath Lake project, and 
the blue lines are the more normal 
years. Then we have the worst ever 
drought of 2001. Then we have the ter-
rible drought of 2010, and here we are 
with this year’s drought deliveries 
forecast to be essentially the same as 
2001. 
In 2001 there was a water war in Or-
egon. Some of you may remember that 
there was a bucket brigade to take 
water out of a canal ditch or to put 
water into the canal ditch. There were 
protests. There was great anger and 
frustration. Since then, in 2010, though, 
we had worked out partnerships be-
tween the competing constituencies. 
They worked together to try to develop 
a plan for the region so that when cri-
sis hit, they could be in partnership 
rather than in conflict. 
So 2010 didn’t end up to be national 
news like 2001. Well, I am here tonight 
to say that part of that partnership 
was working with the Federal Govern-
ment intensely to provide assistance, 
to provide assistance in funding that 
would help retire or disconnect the use 
of water rights for a given year and to 
pump water out of the ground—use 
groundwater—which is very expensive. 
The Klamath Water Users Associa-
tion says that, typically, 350,000 acre- 
feet of water is needed to fully irrigate 
the basin. Now, at the beginning of this 
season, farmers were told they would 
get a fraction of that, maybe 140,000 
acre-feet of water. 
So they went to work with that in 
mind. They have to charge the canals, 
get initial water into the canals to pre-
pare for planting, prepare for the water 
that would come with summer. And 
they used about 25,000 of that 140,000 
acre-feet. 
But there was less water even than 
anticipated, unexpectedly low inflows 
from the snow pack—not enough snow, 
and it melted too fast. 
So, now, it is not 140,000 acre-feet; it 
is 80,000, again, putting it on par with 
2001 that generated so much tension 
and conflict and anxiety. That means 
that just 55,000 acre-feet remain. Com-
pare that to the typical 350,000 needed 
to fully irrigate the basin. 
So farmers are going to be cut off. 
Ranchers are going to be cut off. We 
need, here in Congress, to come to 
their aid. The basin and its 1,200 farm-
ers are in deep trouble. 
The impacts don’t just stop with 
them. It will be felt up and down the 
economy. With no crops to harvest, our 
food chain takes a big hit. The workers 
who usually harvest these crops aren’t 
going to have jobs to go to. Local busi-
nesses that supply things like seed and 
fertilizer and farm equipment, well, 
they are hit hard too. 
So the farmers and the community— 
the economic community—need our 
help, and they need it now. The worst 
thing we can do is stand by and say 
that, in these times of trouble, we 
aren’t here to help. 
That is why, tomorrow, I will be in-
troducing a bill that will give the Bu-
reau of Reclamation flexibility and au-
thority to utilize the $10 million a year 
that has been previously authorized 
and appropriated to work with the 
farmers and the basin’s ranching com-
munity. 
Now, this money, as I mentioned, has 
already been authorized. It has already 
been appropriated. So why should I 
need to introduce a bill? Well, the an-
swer is, a lot of bureaucratic redtape. 
In 2018, Senator WYDEN and I worked 
here and GREG WALDEN worked on the 
House side—the congressman who rep-
resents this district—and we got a con-
cept into the Water Resources Develop-
ment Act, the WRDA bill, and it 
passed. That bill passed. 
It went to the Oval Office. It had 
President Trump’s support. But, after 
the bill was enacted, the lawyers at the 
Bureau of Reclamation said: We are 
sorry. The language we gave you isn’t 
quite right, on further examination, 
and we can’t release these funds. 
So, last year, Senator WYDEN and I 
were able to work again in partnership 
with Congressman WALDEN, and in July 
2019 we passed language here in the 
Senate to fix this. 
Well, OK. That is great, except that 
bill didn’t make it through the House. 
That technical corrections bill never 
made it to the Oval Office. 
So there is $10 million out there—au-
thorized, previously appropriated—that 
needs a technical fix to be able to help 
out our farmers and ranchers right 
now. Now, I am not saying to all of you 
that this will be enough help in this in-
credibly horrific drought year. We may 
well need significantly more, but at 
least this first step should be taken 
right away. 
That is the bill I will be introducing 
tomorrow with the full support, again, 
of my partners in this effort: Congress-
man WALDEN and Senator WYDEN. 
Farmers and ranchers need help, and 
they need it now. This is not a silver 
bullet, but it is something easily with-
in our reach. Let’s do these simple 
things that are within our reach: 
Money 
that 
has 
been 
authorized, 
money that has been appropriated, 
money that hit a technical glitch at

the Bureau of Reclamation—let’s fix it 
and get help right now to idle land and 
to pump water to provide assistance. 
I thank all my colleagues who helped 
so much in 2010 when I came to this 
floor under similar circumstances and 
we gave unanimous consent for this 
bill. Congressman WALDEN came down 
the hallway to vouch for the issues we 
were facing, so we were hearing bipar-
tisan representation of the challenges 
and addressing the challenges that our 
ranchers and farmers in Klamath Basin 
faced. 
That is all we are doing again. I ask 
for each and every Member’s support 
that we get this done and we get it 
done quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
have just returned from being in Ten-
nessee this weekend and lots of phone 
calls, seeing a lot of people out and 
about. I will tell you, this COVID–19 
has changed a lot about how we go 
about our daily lives, but it has not 
changed the way Congress works out 
its differences. We are still arguing 
about spending and debt. We are still 
debating the importance of federalism 
and how the Constitution can help us 
determine what we can and should do 
on a Federal level to help our commu-
nities back at home. 
Now, in Tennessee, our cities all 
across the State, from one corner to 
another, are getting back to that daily 
routine. Many of those businesses were 
able to improvise their way through 
the early weeks of lockdown, and now 
they are finding what they are calling 
their new normal, their new processes. 
Some of them received emergency 
loans from the SBA. Others became one 
of the more than 80,000 small busi-
nesses and self-employed workers who 
were able to take advantage of the 
Paycheck Protection Program. 
But no matter how hard they work or 
how smart their plans are, we know 
that, in the end, we are going to lose a 
lot of our favorite neighborhood stops. 
It is tough. It is really tough out there. 
Some of those businesses are already 
gone. And that is going to happen in 
spite of the unprecedented investment 
that the Federal Government, working 
with our State and local governments, 
has made into our business and our 
healthcare 
sectors, 
making 
certain 
people are able to stay afloat and 
bridging from that rescue to a business 
restart and bridging on to recovery. 
Well, as we saw this week, the more 
Washington spends, the more Washing-
ton’s focus drifts away from emergency 
measures and that rescue, and it 
doesn’t go to a restart or a recovery. 
What does it do? It goes to, How can we 
use this crisis to grow government? 
How can we use this crisis to take 
away a little bit more of your freedom? 
Last week, House Democrats passed a 
$3 trillion spending package that they 
used as a vehicle for a lot of their pet 
projects. We have all heard about it: 
pension bailouts, unsustainable envi-
ronmental 
mandates, 
fundamental 
changes to tax policy, all of these line 
items that have no business being 
slapped on the coattails of a bill that 
was sold as being a safety net for pan-
icked Americans. 
You will be relieved to know that 
that bill will never see the light of day 
here in the Senate. But, you know, it 
might not be a bad idea just to put it 
on the floor and see if our friends 
across the aisle want to vote for it—$3 
trillion, $3 trillion. 
It is disrespectful to people who are 
hurting. It is disrespectful to small 
businesses that they have become a 
bargaining chip for the Democratic, 
left-leaning socialist wish list. That is 
what they think of you. When you walk 
down Main Street and you see shut-
tered businesses, I want you to remem-
ber that. That is what they think of 
you: They can use you to get what they 
want. 
In fact, I will say this. We have been 
pretty busy focusing on bipartisan ef-
forts that will help in the short term 
and will help with a postpandemic fu-
ture, something that will really bring 
relief and clarity to the American peo-
ple—not things like a liberal wish list. 
SECURING AMERICA’S MEDICINE CABINET ACT 
Mr. President, here is one I have 
heard a lot about, especially this week-
end, for all the moms and dads out 
there who are wondering about how 
safe their child’s image and their 
child’s data are in the virtual class-
room. Well, this is something that I 
had lots of questions about also. How 
do you protect your virtual you? 
Last week, I led a bipartisan group of 
my colleagues and asked the FTC to do 
a deep dive into how the tech industry 
collects and stores your child’s data 
and to use that information to make 
children’s online privacy protections 
stronger. 
Let’s make certain you can protect 
them in the virtual space the same as 
you can in the physical space. My bi-
partisan SAM–C bill, which Senator 
MENENDEZ
and 
I 
have 
introduced, 
would offer incentives to American 
pharmaceutical companies to bring 
those operations back home. 
Let’s make that in America. This 
would create thousands of jobs, and it 
would help secure our pharmaceutical 
supply chain. 
We are focusing on these things be-
cause recovery is going to require more 
than a blank check. If we want to be 
successful, we have to learn to recog-
nize the practical damage this disease 
has inflicted on our economy and then 
do something to address the many root 
causes of it. 
Every day, we witness local, State, 
and 
Federal 
Government 
officials 
struggling to balance the provision of 
community health with the needs of a 
struggling economy. Often, regulatory 
constraints prevent them from imple-
menting the more agile policies so des-
perately needed by local businesses and 
service providers. 
Last week, I and a number of my col-
leagues asked Majority Leader MCCON-
NELL and Minority Leader SCHUMER to 
include statutory changes in the next 
round of relief legislation that would 
reduce the redtape, the paperwork, and 
the other requirements that could and 
will inevitably get in the way of eco-
nomic recovery. 
If we take a hard look at these regu-
lations and strip away those that serve 
no real purpose, we will save businesses 
an estimated—get this—$1.9 trillion, 
promote competition, and encourage 
investment. That is $1.9 trillion. That 
is what the regulatory state costs 
American businesses. 
To survive the pandemic, each and 
every one of us is going to have to re-
examine our approach. We need to ask 
ourselves: What is the purpose of all 
the regulations? Do they help? Do they 
hurt? If we didn’t need it in COVID–19, 
why do we need it now? What is the ac-
tual cost to businesses, to commu-
nities, to local governments of these 
regulations? As companies go through 
the restart, is this something that is 
going to speed the process or is it 
something that is going to slow the 
process, or is it something that is 
going to be so cost-prohibitive that 
that 
small 
business 
manufacturing 
company will just throw their hands up 
and say: ‘‘I give up. I give up’’? That is 
not what we want. That is not recov-
ery. That is not optimism. That would 
be defeat. I encourage us all to join in 
this effort to create an environment 
that will support a full economic recov-
ery. 
I yield floor.

REMEMBERING TOM COBURN 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, in March, 
our country lost a great statesman and 
my fellow ‘‘squealer,’’ former Senator 
Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. A family 
physician who delivered more than 
4,000 babies, he was known as ‘‘Dr. 
Tom’’ in Oklahoma, but in Washington 
he was called ‘‘Dr. No’’ because of his 
fierce opposition to adding more red 
ink to the national debt. 
Having served just 10 years in the 
Senate before retiring in 2019, the year 
I was elected, I never had the honor to 
serve alongside Dr. Coburn. Nonethe-
less, his leadership and his efforts to 
eliminate government waste and over-
reach continues to be an inspiration to 
me and to many others. 
‘‘If you cannot find waste in any part 
of the Federal budget,’’ he once com-
mented, ‘‘it can only be for one rea-
son—you haven’t looked.’’ Many of the 
outlandish examples he exposed are 
now what I call legendary. Take, for 
example, the shrimp on a treadmill, 
and of course there was the ‘‘bridge to 
nowhere.’’ 
Every Federal agency in Washington 
feared the notoriety of being called out 
in Dr. Coburn’s annual report of gov-
ernment excess known as the waste 
book. He led the fight that ended con-
gressional earmarks that were known 
as pork projects. While others got cred-
it for creating new government pro-
grams, Dr. Coburn took on the thank-
less job of trying to unravel the maze 
of duplicative, overlapping programs 
and redundant and inefficient bureauc-
racy. 
The law he authored requiring the 
Government Accountability Office, or 
GAO, to identify duplication within 
Federal programs has saved our tax-
payers more than $260 billion to date. I 
think the head of GAO said it best; 
that this law is ‘‘the gift that keeps on 
giving, and it will for a long time.’’ 
This effort is not just saving money; it 
is making government more efficient 
in other important ways. 
An egregious example found that as a 
result of Coburn’s duplication law, 
there are 10 different agencies with 23 
different overlapping and fragmented 
definitions for sexual violence. If we 
can’t even define the problem, how are 
we going to stop it, folks? That is why 
I am proud to say that I have joined 
Senator RON JOHNSON’s efforts to clar-
ify the definition of sexual violence 
and improve data collection so that we 
can address this issue head on. 
Another law Coburn authored with 
none other than then-Senator Barack 
Obama put all Federal expenditures on-
line so that taxpayers could simply 
Google to find out how their tax dol-
lars are being spent. Hailed as the 
greatest government transparency re-
form since the Freedom of Information 
Act, 
the 
public 
website, 
USAspending.gov is helping to keep 
Washington accountable for how every 
cent is spent. If you go on the website 
today you can find ridiculous examples 
of binge-buying bureaucrats who are 
ringing up tens of billions of dollars of 
last-minute, unnecessary purchases at 
the end of a fiscal year, splurging on 
unnecessary things like tons of Tater 
Tots, $4.6 million on crab legs and lob-
ster, and even a foosball table. When I 
heard of this outlandish spending, I 
embraced my inner Tom Coburn and 
took action, putting forward a bill to 
end Washington’s year-end, use-it-or- 
lose-it spending sprees. 
Folks, Tom Coburn was not afraid to 
work across the aisle to find com-
promise 
without 
compromising 
his 
principles or values. There is no better 
example than the friendship he struck 
up with President Obama. The two 
were elected to the Senate the same 
year, and they were on opposite sides 
of nearly every major issue during 
their time in Washington. Yet Dr. 
Coburn would regularly call to offer en-
couragement to President Obama and 
pray for him and his family. The two of 
them could even be spotted hugging 
and laughing together at the State of 
the Union Address. 
At a time when the focus too often is 
on what separates rather than unites 
us, these are relationship goals we 
should all aspire to achieve with one 
another if we hope to tackle the un-
precedented problems now facing our 
Nation. 
Our hearts and prayers are with Dr. 
Coburn’s wife Carolyn and his daugh-
ters and grandchildren as they grieve 
his loss. While he can never be re-
placed, we can all take comfort know-
ing Tom Coburn has made this world a 
better place and that the legacy he left 
behind endures through many of his 
staff members as well, such as Roland 
Foster, who is now on my staff. The 
legacy he left behind endures and the 
crusade he championed continues. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor to my 
colleague from Indiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank 
Senator ERNST for that beautiful testi-
mony to Senator Tom Coburn. 
While I was running for Senate, I was 
often asked who my heroes were in the 
U.S. Senate. The first name that al-
ways came to mind was Dr. Tom 
Coburn. 
As a legislator, Dr. Coburn was a 
force of nature. As a conservative stal-
wart who stood by his principles—no 
matter the pressure—and with whom-
ever would stand with him, regardless 
of party, Dr. Coburn’s entire career was 
a profile in courage. He believed so 
strongly that America’s best wisdom 
wasn’t held on Wall Street or Pennsyl-
vania Avenue but on Main Street, 
among the small business owners, doc-
tors, families, and workers who really 
keep our country going. 
Dr. Coburn blasted a path for con-
servative outsiders to take on Wash-
ington orthodoxy on everything from 
national debt to term limits, to our 
broken healthcare system, and his ca-
reer was an inspiration for me to leave 
my business and run for the Senate. 
His 
bedside 
manner 
was 
often 
brusque, but on the tough issues, like 
any good doctor, Tom Coburn told peo-
ple what they needed to hear, not what 
they wanted to hear. 
To Dr. Tom Coburn, our towering na-
tional debt was not just a thorn in

May 18, 2020 
America’s side; it was a supreme moral 
failing. As one of the few true fiscal 
hawks 
in 
recent 
decades, 
Senator 
Coburn wore the nickname ‘‘Dr. No’’ as 
a badge of courage, understanding that 
there is nothing commendable about 
spending our grandchildren’s money 
just because we will not be at the table 
when the bill comes due. 
If there is one thing that could fix 
Washington more than any other, it is 
strict term limits and more account-
ability for Congress. Inspired by Dr. 
Coburn, I made my pledge to only serve 
two terms a fixture of my campaign 
and am following his example by refus-
ing to accept a congressional pension 
when I leave. 
Last year, my bill to make pensions 
for Congress optional passed the Sen-
ate, putting us one step closer to get-
ting rid of this outdated, taxpayer- 
funded perk altogether. 
No Budget, No Pay, a bill Dr. Coburn 
championed in the Senate, was the 
first bill I introduced after taking of-
fice. It is a simple measure: Congress 
doesn’t need a paycheck until they 
pass a budget. I am proud to say it has 
now cleared committee thanks to the 
work from fellow conservative out-
siders like Senator RICK
SCOTT
and 
DAVID PERDUE. 
As a family physician who continued 
to see patients even as he served in 
Congress, Dr. Coburn always had a spe-
cial passion for fixing our broken 
healthcare system. He understood bet-
ter than anyone that our healthcare 
woes began at a fundamentally broken 
system in need of transparency, more 
choice for patients, and market-driven 
reforms to put decision-making back 
into the hands of Americans and their 
care providers. 
My bills to lower prescription drug 
prices and ensure every patient knows 
what they have to pay before they pay 
it were introduced with invaluable 
input from Dr. Coburn. As we all 
should, he recognized that, no matter 
how vast the distance between our po-
sitions seems to be, healthcare is and 
always should be a bipartisan issue 
where compromise is necessary to help 
patients. 
In the summer of 2018, I was honored 
that Dr. Coburn came to Indiana to 
campaign with me. I will never forget 
what he said to a young man from the 
crowd at one of our events. 
‘‘What can I do now if I want to be a 
Senator someday?’’ 
Dr. Coburn didn’t tell him to go to 
law school. He didn’t tell him to run 
for office or intern in a congressional 
office. 
‘‘Go work really hard at something 
for 40 years so you have something to 
say when you get there.’’ 
I loved it. Dr. Coburn ushered in the 
era of the outsider in Washington, the 
effects of which are only just now be-
ginning to be realized. I think we could 
get a much better product out of DC 
with more people like him whose be-
liefs come from a deep well of real- 
world experience. 
He was more than just an inspiration 
for me and other conservatives to leave 
the private sector and shake up busi-
ness as usual in DC. He was one of the 
greatest Senators, most effective prob-
lem-solvers, and most important con-
servative voices of our time—the great 
outsider. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). The majority leader.

formation and search history from

intel-
ligence and international terrorism in-
vestigations. On vote No. 89, had I been

I was also necessarily absent for roll-
call vote No. 90, adoption of amend-
ment No. 1584, to improve the amicus

f 
NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, each 
year, I look forward to National Foster 
Care Month as an opportunity to honor 
the more than 440,000 children and 
youth in foster care nationwide. It is 
also an opportunity to honor the foster 
and kinship families and child welfare 
workers who support them. 
This year, in particular, the impor-
tance 
of 
supporting 
the 
children, 
youth, families and skilled workers in 
the foster care system has been under-
scored 
by 
the 
devastation 
of 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic. It is essential that 
Congress not only honor those who 
give and receive care as part of this 
system, but also those who take mean-
ingful action to protect families, chil-
dren, youth, and workers from the 
spread of the virus. 
In my home State of Oregon, more 
than 11,000 children and youth enter 
foster care in a given year, and about 
7,900 children and youth are living in 
out-of-home placements on any given 
day. Oregon provides transition serv-
ices to about 1,350 young adults, but 
many continue to struggle to find 
work, go to college, or complete tech-
nical training. The COVID–19 virus has 
hit these older youth particularly hard. 
As we consider actions to help the 
nation weather this pandemic, I would 
like to recognize a nonprofit organiza-
tion in my State that represents a crit-
ical part of the response to COVID–19 
for children and youth in the foster 
care system and those who have aged 
out of the system without finding a 
home to call their own. FosterClub is 
based in a beautiful town on the Or-
egon coast, Seaside. FosterClub is 
marking its 20th anniversary working 
to improve the lives of children and 
youth in foster care by connecting 
them to resources, teaching them how 
to become self advocates, and helping 
elevate their lived experiences and 
voices to members of Congress. By 
doing so, they are able to inform posi-
tive changes in our federal foster care 
system. 
And that is what this month is about: 
honoring the strength of those cur-
rently in and those who have exited the 
foster care system. It is about listening 
to their experiences and their needs. 
Over the years, I have been proud to 
work with my colleagues on a bipar-
tisan basis to craft and get across the 
finish line legislation to strengthen 
and improve the foster care policies in 
Oregon and around the country. Not 
too long ago, then-Chairman Orrin 
Hatch and I were able to come together 
and pass into law the landmark Family 
First Prevention Services Act, com-
monly known as Family First. 
Family First was Children Defense

foster care system focused on helping 
families stay together. This bipartisan 
legislation transformed the child wel-
fare system to provide parents the help 
they need to prevent the trauma that 
occurs when children and youth are re-
moved unnecessarily from their homes 
and placed in foster care. I remain 
committed to responding to the needs 
of children and youth in foster care and 
am dedicated to pursuing bipartisan 
ways to address the challenges faced by 
children, youth, families, and workers 
in the foster care system and especially 
now during the COVID–19 public health 
emergency. 
I call on my colleagues, especially 
those across the aisle, to remember our 
Nation’s foster care recipients and ac-
knowledge the strain our Nation’s 
most vulnerable are facing during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. As we work to-
wards future ways to address the 
COVID–19 pandemic, we must act swift-
ly to provide support for the children, 
youth, families, and workforce in-
volved in the foster care system and es-
pecially the young adults who have 
aged out of the system without finding 
a forever home. 
I encourage my colleagues to listen 
carefully to the voices of children and 
youth impacted by the foster care sys-
tem, act quickly to support these 
young people through this pandemic 
and help them transition to adulthood 
successfully. They deserve nothing less 
from their representatives in Congress.
