PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Lord of all creation, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
Americans can see on television 
trucks carrying the first rollout of vac-
cinations in our country. For many 
this is a great sign of hope, for others 
a moment of concern. Give Your people 
hope, and courage where needed, to 
take advantage of this tremendous 
breakthrough. 
We praise Your holy name that You 
have gifted so many men and women 
who have labored to bring this day to 
fruition: Brilliant medical scientists, 
down to logistical professionals, to de-
livery personnel. We are all served so 
well by these generous brothers and 
sisters. 
Continue to strengthen the resolve of 
legislators here in the Capitol in their 
efforts to provide an economic relief 
bill and funding the government. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H7282 
December 20, 2020 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.J. Res. 
110, currently under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, on Friday, I informed 
the House that we were very close to 
agreement on a year-end funding pack-
age. 
I am pleased to say that we have now 
reached agreement, but logistics of as-
sembling such a comprehensive bill re-
quire additional time. This continuing 
resolution 
provides 
that 
additional 
time and will allow this Congress to 
complete our work on government 
funding and coronavirus relief. I urge 
my colleagues to join me in support of 
this clean extension of funding. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of this short- 
term continuing resolution. 
As I said last week, we have been ne-
gotiating night and day for weeks to 
reach agreement on full-year appro-
priations bills and a coronavirus relief 
package. I am proud that we have 
reached agreement that will fully fund 
the government for the rest of the fis-
cal year and provide more desperately 
needed relief for the American people 
and 
businesses 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
Passing this CR is simply a stopgap 
measure to give the House and the Sen-
ate time to pass this bipartisan agree-
ment and get it to the President’s desk 
for a signature. I urge my colleagues to 
join me in voting in favor of this con-
tinuing resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
supporting this stopgap measure to 
avoid a government shutdown as we 
finish our critical work to fund govern-
ment and respond to the COVID pan-
demic. 
As my time in Congress nears a close, 
I must briefly, very briefly, reflect on 
my 32 years of service, which has been 
guided by a basic principle: When you 
see a problem, do something about it. 
In times of crisis like we face today, 
and after September 11 and Superstorm 
Sandy, delivering relief has been my 
sacred duty. 
I will be forever grateful to col-
leagues, advocates, and excellent staff 
who helped me secure critical Federal 
funds directly for my district, indelibly 
shape women’s health policy, enact 
lifesaving food allergy labeling and the 
.08 BAC drunk driving standard, and 
too many other achievements to fully 
recount now. 
Limited debate time leaves me un-
able to acknowledge by name all of my 
exceptional staff, but I must thank my 
chief of staff for the last 16 years, Eliz-
abeth Stanley, and my unequaled dis-
trict director, Pat Keegan, who, for 
more than 26 years, has led my out-
standing district staff in solving thou-
sands of cases for constituents who 
needed help. 
Our successes are often overlooked 
amid partisan rancor and the notion 
that institutions of government are ir-
revocably broken. I do not believe they 
are. 
To my colleagues from both sides of 
the aisle, across the country, and the 
political spectrum, our work together 
is a testament to the enduring values 
of public service and of a collective 
commitment to better the world. You 
inspired me to be a better legislator, 
and I am grateful. While I leave Con-
gress as the first chairwoman of the 
House Appropriations Committee, the 
title I still cherish most is United 
States Representative from New York. 
To those I have represented: Thank 
you for your trust and confidence. 
To my family, my wonderful hus-
band, Steve; my children and their 
spouses, Dana and David, Doug and 
Ellen, and Jackie and David; and my 
grandchildren, Jillian, Daniel, Ilan, 
Jesse, Jonah, Rebecca, Jonathan, and 
Solene, your endless support has made 
my career possible. I hope you are 
ready for a lot more of me. 
Mr. Speaker, with gratitude for hav-
ing had the honor and privilege to 
serve, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
LOWEY) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the joint resolution, H.J. 
Res. 110. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 329, nays 65,

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 20, 2020 
No. 217 
Senate 
The Senate met at 1 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY).

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Our Father in Heaven, You keep us 
from stumbling and falling. We trust 
Your power. We sing of Your steadfast 
love and proclaim Your faithfulness to 
all generations. Make us one Nation, 
truly wise with righteousness, exalting 
us in due season. 
Today, inspire our lawmakers to 
walk in the light of Your countenance. 
Abide with them so that Your wisdom 
will influence each decision they make. 
Keep them from the evil that brings 
grief, enabling them to avoid the pit-
falls that lead to ruin. Lord, empower 
them to glorify You in all they say and 
do. 
We pray in Your Holy Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COR-
NYN). The President pro tempore is rec-
ognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to, please, have 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
117TH CONGRESS 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today is Sunday, and I want to remem-
ber what Senator Byrd said on a lot of 
Sundays when the Senate was in ses-
sion. He didn’t say this because he 
didn’t want to work on Sunday, but he 
wanted everybody to remember the sig-
nificance of Sunday for some people, 
particularly 
Christians. 
He 
always 
said: ‘‘Remember the Sabbath and keep 
it holy.’’ 
Now, I want to refer to another par-
ticular Sunday. Never in the Senate’s 
history has the Senate convened Con-
gress—meaning a new Congress—on a 
Sunday. The Constitution mandates 
that Congress convene at noon on Jan-
uary 3, unless the preceding Congress, 
by law, designates a different day. 
Of course, January 3 has fallen on a 
Sunday over the last 238 years, and 
each time, by unanimous consent, the 
Congress set a new convening day 
other than that Sunday. So now it ap-
pears, for the first time in history, that 
Senate Democrats don’t want to agree 
to such unanimous consent and instead 
are insisting that the Senate start the 
117th Congress on Sunday. 
I am not looking to get out of work. 
I have proven that I have respect for 
attendance in the Senate. But out of 
respect, the Senate usually does not 
have business on religious holidays ob-
served by members of various faiths. 
So just like Senator Byrd, I also 
think the Lord’s Day, particularly 
when it is paired with the weight of 
starting a new Congress, deserves rev-
erence. 
I yield.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
bipartisan, bicameral discussions on 
another major pandemic rescue pack-
age continued all night and this morn-
ing. We are winnowing down the re-
maining differences. I believe I can 
speak for all sides when I say I hope 
and expect to have a final agreement 
nailed down in a matter of hours. 
Yesterday evening, our Democratic 
colleagues agreed to important lan-
guage authored by Senator TOOMEY. 
Back in March, in the CARES Act, 
Congress funded several new emer-
gency lending facilities to be operated 
by the Federal Reserve. Their purpose 
was simple: to backstop the basic foun-
dations of our economy and prevent 
any kind of sweeping financial paral-
ysis. 
Our actions worked. The other his-
toric relief that Congress passed, com-
bined with the existence of these lend-
ing facilities staved off systemic col-
lapse. American workers and families 
still need much more help, but a total 
financial meltdown never materialized. 
These new emergency lending facili-
ties were always intended to sunset at 
the end of this year. Senator TOOMEY 
and our Democratic colleagues have 
landed on compromise language that 
ensures this will, in fact, happen. 
It also redirects the dormant money 
in these accounts toward the urgent 
needs of working Americans and en-
sures that these expired programs can-
not be simply restarted or cloned with-
out another authorization from Con-
gress, all while preserving both the 
independence of the Federal Reserve 
and the proper authority of Congress. 
It is yet another example of good-faith 
bipartisan collaboration that has de-
fined our discussions all week. 
At this point, we are down to the last 
few differences that stand between 
struggling Americans and the major 
rescue package they need and deserve. 
These days and nights of negotia-
tions have been encouraging, but our 
citizens need this waiting game to be 
over. Yesterday alone, another 3,388 of 
my fellow Kentuckians tested positive 
for the coronavirus. The virus con-
tinues to spread throughout our coun-
try. Thousands of Americans are being 
robbed of their lives on a daily basis. 
And while the resilience of the Amer-
ican people have brought along our 
economic recovery faster than ex-
pected, it will remain both insufficient

and tenuous until the vaccines that 
will end this fight have been distrib-
uted all across the Nation. 
For months—literally months—Sen-
ate Republicans have been calling for 
another targeted package to reopen the 
job-saving Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, extend Federal unemployment 
benefits, fund K–12 schools, fund vac-
cine distribution, and get a lot more 
help onto the frontlines as fast as pos-
sible. I am relieved that we appear to 
be just hours away from legislation 
that will finally do that. 
When we get this done, Congress will 
not deserve any special praise, not with 
this relief having waited until late De-
cember and not with some of our 
Democratic colleagues openly saying 
the reason they finally changed their 
tuned was that they finally got a Presi-
dent-elect of their own party. When we 
finalize this measure and pass it, Con-
gress will only have done our job. We 
will have finally done our duty in get-
ting more relief to those who need it 
most. 
Let’s make today the day we join to-
gether, put differences aside, and fi-
nally get it done.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
we have spent the past 4 to 5 days 
locked in intense bipartisan negotia-
tions over the final details of an emer-
gency relief package. There are a few 
issues outstanding, but I am quite 
hopeful that we are closing in on an 
outcome. It appears that, barring a 
major mishap, the Senate and House 
will be able to vote on final legislation 
as early as tonight—tonight. 
Many of the provisions in this bill 
are already public. They are all items 
that the country desperately needs and 
upon which there is no disagreement. 
We all are ready to deliver a des-
perately needed extension of enhanced 
unemployment benefits; direct survival 
checks to millions of American fami-
lies; crucial relief to our schools, our 
small businesses, our healthcare sys-
tem; and funding to support the pro-
duction and distribution of a vaccine. 
As of yesterday, we have been stead-
ily working through all of the other 
outstanding 
issues, 
but 
one 
issue 
threatened to derail the bill. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania made an elev-
enth-hour demand to curtail the au-
thority of the Fed to respond to eco-
nomic crises, potentially leaving the 
Fed with less authority than it had 
even prior to the pandemic. 
The language in his provision was so 
broad, the intent seemed to be to sabo-
tage the incoming administration’s 
ability to stabilize the economy and 
save jobs. That was completely unac-
ceptable to Democrats. 
But late last night the logjam was 
broken. Senator TOOMEY accepted my 
compromise to remove the dangerous 
‘‘similar to’’ language in his bill that 
was overly broad. We sent the Senator 
far more limited language around 8 
p.m. last night, and it was accepted a 
few hours later with a few technical 
changes. As a result, the Federal Re-
serve will retain its tools and author-
ity in the event of a true emergency. 
Now, this compromise should not 
have taken as long as it did, and, 
frankly, it was irresponsible to threat-
en the entire package with this ideo-
logical attempt to limit the Fed and 
Treasury’s powers in an emergency. 
But I am very glad that our Repub-
lican colleagues relented and accepted 
our offer. The Toomey legislation was 
the last significant stumbling block to 
a bipartisan agreement moving for-
ward. 
Solving our disagreement over the 
Fed’s authority was a key to unlocking 
the rest of the bill and putting us on a 
path to final legislation. Now that we 
have solved that disagreement, we can 
close in on a final agreement, finish 
drafting 
legislation, 
and 
move 
it 
through both Chambers of Congress— 
hopefully, as soon as tonight. As we 
speak, the legislative text is being fi-
nalized. 
The time has come to move forward 
and reach a conclusion. The legislation 
that is coming together will put money 
in the pockets of everyday people and 
extend many of the benefits that we in-
cluded in the CARES Act, a bill I was 
proud to negotiate with Secretary 
Mnuchin. 
I will be the first to admit that, 
while this short-term deal is necessary 
to meet the urgent and growing needs 
that so many people are facing imme-
diately going into the winter, this bill 
is not sufficient. It is necessary. It is 
not sufficient. 
Democrats would have liked to pro-
vide more relief, especially to State 
and local governments and especially 
to American families on the brink of fi-
nancial collapse. The survival checks 
in this bill are a good start, but there 
was 
bipartisan 
support 
for 
$1,200 
checks. 
So let me be clear about one thing: 
This bill will not be the final word on 
congressional COVID relief. 
When this Chamber gavels back in 
2021, we must pick up immediately 
where we left off. We must protect peo-
ple’s jobs, whether they work for a 
company or a local government; wheth-
er they live in blue States or red 
States; whether they are office employ-
ees or teachers, bus drivers and fire-
fighters. 
Still, the significance of this package 
should not be underestimated. We will 
deliver the second largest Federal 
stimulus in our Nation’s history. Only 
the CARES Act will have been bigger. 
This package will give the new Presi-
dent a head start as he prepares to 
right our ailing economy. And it won’t 
include any provision to limit the legal 
rights of workers who are put in harm’s 
way. It won’t include any provision to 
gratuitously limit the authority of the 
Fed. 
On many issues, where Republicans 
once refused to grant an inch, we were 
also able to make meaningful steps for-
ward. Republicans, in their initial pro-
posal, wanted zero direct payments. 
They wanted zero unemployment in-
surance. They wanted zero rent relief. 
Only a few months ago, the Republican 
leader admitted that 20 Members of his 
caucus didn’t want to approve another 
dime in spending. Now we are on the 
verge of passing more than $900 billion. 
Once an agreement is finalized, I will 
have a lot more to say about the con-
tents of the bill and the process it took 
to achieve it. But for now, I am happy 
to report we have surmounted the final 
largest hurdle, and an ending is in 
sight. Let’s get the job done together 
for the sake of the American people. 
I yield the floor.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the fact 
that we are here on a Sunday indicates 
to me something is different about 
what we are about and, to me, speaks 
to a sense of urgency that we ought to 
have to complete our work before the 
Christmas holiday, and there are few 
things more pressing than our agenda 
today. 
Government funding, as we know, is 
scheduled to expire at 12 midnight to-
night, and unless we take action in the 
next few hours, our country will be 
thrown into another government shut-
down. I hope every Member of this 
body can understand why this is simply 
not an option. I have heard some peo-
ple talk about, well, it is not a real 
shutdown if it happens for just a few 
hours or a couple of days over the 
weekend, but I think the appearance is 
horrible and speaks to our not living 
up to our responsibility to do this on a 
timely basis and without any lapse in 
government funding. This is not the 
time to furlough hard-working public 
servants or send our various govern-
mental Departments and Agencies into 
chaos. 
We need to pass a funding bill that 
will provide stability for the remainder 
of the fiscal year, through the end of 
September next year, and give our gov-
ernment the ability to operate with 
certainty. All you have to do is talk to 
the leaders at the Pentagon, and they 
will tell you how chaotic and ineffi-
cient it is when Congress passes short- 
term continuing resolutions, which 
speaks to the importance of providing 
some certainty and predictability to 
the funding stream, but we know gov-
ernment funding is only one of the 
things left to do on our list. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. President, our country is racing 
to distribute two now successful vac-
cines to bring an end to this pandemic 
that we have been living through that 
has claimed the lives of more than 
315,000 Americans. Millions of workers 
have lost their jobs. They have no in-
come. They lost those jobs either 
weeks or several months ago and have 
been struggling to support themselves 
and their families. Sometimes I won-
der, as we delay in responding and pro-
viding additional relief, whether those 
who receive paychecks have sufficient 
empathy for those who are receiving no 
paychecks. Time is of the essence. 
Small businesses are crunching the 
numbers, trying to determine how 
much longer they can hang on and 
keep their employees on the payrolls, if 
they have been able to at all. 
Of course, teachers are doing the best 
they can to teach our children vir-
tually or in hybrid situations, with 
some children going back to the class-
room. This has been a tragic cir-
cumstance, I believe, particularly for 
many low-income children for whom 
virtual learning is simply not an op-
tion or is simply failing them because 
many of them have no access to 
broadband. They may not have suffi-
cient supervision at home to help them 
through their studies. To me, it is in-
credible that we expect to put children 
who are in elementary school in front 
of computer screens for 8 hours a day 
and expect them to get what they need 
in terms of their education. 
Of course, none of this is news. We 
have known about not only the need 
but the urgency of each of these prior-
ities for months now. Unfortunately, 
the partisan dysfunction leading up to 
the election prevented us from making 
more progress since the CARES Act 
was passed last March. Yet, with the 
election in November, we finally saw 
some interest on the part of congres-
sional leaders on both sides of the 
aisle, on both sides of the Capitol, in 
negotiating a compromise. 
There are many of our colleagues— 
some of whom are sitting here in the 
Chamber today—who have dedicated a 
lot of time and effort to trying to help 
the leadership build a consensus and 
get to yes, which I hope we will get to 
very soon. We know there have been a 
lot of negotiations and a lot of loose 
ends, but vaccines, workers, small busi-
nesses, and schools should be our pri-
ority. 
According to the Democratic leader 
and the majority leader, we apparently 
are just hours away from finalizing a 
bipartisan deal, but none of us have ac-
tually seen the text yet of what this 
looks like. The only responsible thing 
is for us to be able to study it and un-
derstand exactly what is happening. 
The House Committee on Rules, pre-
sumably, will meet and pass a rule, and 
then it will go to the House floor. I 
know some people are saying we can 
get this done today. To me, that seems 
unlikely, but I guess we can all hope. I 
hope we do this responsibly and not 
just quickly. 
We do know that the American peo-
ple are suffering and that this is not 
the time for politics or delay for 
delay’s sake. This is a time to come to-
gether to compromise and make good 
on the commitment we have made to 
support the American people. I am sort 
of expecting smoke signals from some 
quarters, but I hope the signs that we 
are all trying to read, the tea leaves 
and the like, become a lot clearer 
today so that we can chart a clear path 
forward to both government funding 
and coronavirus relief. 
While the size and shape of this legis-
lation is still coming together, I hope 
it will include legislation I introduced 
earlier this year to help some of our 
hardest hit small businesses. 
Over the last few months, we have 
heard much about the incredible suc-
cess of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, which deserves all of the acco-
lades it has received because it has pro-
vided a vital lifeline to America’s 
small businesses and their employees. 
These loans helped employees make 
payroll and cover business expenses 
during the most difficult parts of the

pandemic, and by any measure, the 
program has been an incredible suc-
cess. 
But not all small businesses have 
been eligible for the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, and some of the most 
heavily impacted are our small, inde-
pendent venues. These businesses were 
the first to close when COVID–19 hit, 
and they are likely to be the last to 
open when it is behind us. 
Live, cultural, musical, theatrical 
events are not only critical cultural in-
stitutions, but they are huge drivers of 
local economies. 
A single event can provide paychecks 
not only to the artists and performers 
but to lighting and sound technicians, 
bartenders, ticket takers, concessions, 
and merchandise salesmen, as well as 
security guards, cleaning staff, and the 
list goes on and on. 
Unlike restaurants, which have been 
able to offer at least carryout or out-
door 
dining, 
or 
retailers, 
which 
switched to curbside pickup, there is 
no virtual substitution for these live 
events. 
That is why, working with the Sen-
ator from Minnesota, Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, I introduced the Save Our 
Stages Act so that these venues can be 
kept afloat so that when we are able to 
put the virus behind us, our favorite, 
small, independent venues will be able 
to open their doors once again. 
This is a stressful and scary moment 
for the Texans who work at and fre-
quent our favorite venues, and the 
Save Our Stages Act can provide some 
hope for these cultural institutions. 
I am proud to say that 58 of our col-
leagues have cosponsored Save Our 
Stages, making it one of the most 
widely supported bipartisan proposals 
before the Senate. 
These final hours of negotiations are 
not the time to try to change the basic 
contours of that proposal to benefit 
well-endowed institutions or institu-
tions that don’t, frankly, need the 
money, while these other venues are 
dying unless they get the money. 
Save Our Stages will benefit beloved, 
small, independent music venues and 
other theaters and the like across the 
country and ensure those marquees 
will shine bright once again. 
So as we all know, time is running 
out. The Congress needs to take action 
and take action soon. 
We cannot add the stress of another 
government shutdown to a raging pan-
demic. It is time for us to come to-
gether and get this done for the Amer-
ican people. 
I yield the floor. 
(Mr. HOEVEN assumed the chair.) 
(Mr. DAINES assumed the chair.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BAR-
RASSO). The Senator from Missouri. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss the COVID relief bill 
that I understand is soon to be brought 
before the House and then to this floor. 
I understand that we have finally, at 
long last, a deal that hopefully will re-
sult in real relief for the American peo-
ple. And there is a piece of good news 
that I want to be sure to note, and that 
is that this COVID relief package will 
contain direct assistance to working 
people. For every working family in 
this country that needs it, they will be, 
under this deal, getting a direct check 
just like they did in March. 
Now, that is a victory. There are no 
two ways about it, and we should cele-
brate that victory not on our own be-
half but for the many people in this 
Nation who desperately need it and 
who, until just a few days ago, could 
expect nothing at all in the way of di-
rect assistance from this body. 
I want to thank those who worked so 
hard to make sure that this relief was 
available and is going to the working 
people of this country—not least the 
President of the United States, who 
has been very clear, over and over 
again, that he wants to see direct relief 
to working families, that it should be 
the cornerstone of the bill. Of course, I 
thank Senator SANDERS for his strong 
stand on this issue, and it has been a 
privilege to work with him on it. 
So this is good news—good news for 
working families, good news for work-
ing people just before Christmas, when 
they need the help the most. 
But I have to say that the levels of 
support that I understand will be of-
fered to working people are hardly ade-
quate, and we should not pretend oth-
erwise: $600 per person, $600 per child. 
This is a fraction of what was offered 
to working people in the CARES legis-
lation just a few months ago—legisla-
tion, I might add, that every Member 
of this body voted for—every Member 
voted for. Now they will be getting 
only a portion of that. It all adds up to 
about $100 billion. And we are told that 
there just wasn’t enough left over, that 
there just wasn’t any more available 
for working people. 
Yet I notice that in the spending bill 
that we are also going to vote on as 
part of this package, a bill that costs 
over $1 trillion, we managed to have 
found $65 million for salmon recovery 
in the Pacific, $643 million to carry out 
international communication activi-
ties in the Middle East, $116 million for 
the Export-Import Bank, and $118 mil-
lion for that sterling example of inter-
national leadership, the World Health 
Organization, which has done more to 
undermine world health in the last 
year than I think any international or-
ganization in the history of the world. 
Then there is the so-called bipartisan 
proposal, which is the basis for the 
present deal—the bipartisan proposal 
which included, I might point out, not 
a cent—not a cent—in direct relief for 
working people—almost $1 trillion in 
costs, not one penny in direct relief for 
working people, until it was added re-
cently. That proposal included $20 bil-
lion for higher education—$20 billion. 
This is going to many universities that 
have massive endowments worth bil-
lions and billions of dollars, most of 
that built on the backs of taxpayers, I 
might add. Yet we cannot find any fur-
ther funds to help working people in 
this country. 
I cannot help but note that working 
people were the last consideration in 
the draconian shutdowns earlier this 
year that sent so many of them home, 
that cost them their jobs, that cost 
them their wages, that cost them their 
healthcare on the job, and they have 
consistently been the last consider-
ation in COVID relief in this body ever 
since. Frankly, it is disgraceful and, 
frankly, it is unacceptable. 
So the work that we are going to do 
today—and I hope to see a vote on this 
floor yet today on this relief—is a 
step—a step—in the right direction, 
but it is only a step. And I hope that it 
will be the beginning of a better ap-
proach, the beginning of actually put-
ting working Americans first, putting 
their needs, putting their independ-
ence, putting their strength, their fam-
ilies, their communities first. 
That ought to be the economic policy 
of this Nation. That ought to be the 
economic policy of this body. And I can 
assure you, that is the foundation on 
which economic recovery will be built 
because it is the working people of this 
Nation who power the American econ-
omy. 
Don’t believe anything else. We hear 
a lot about global capital. We hear 
about the need to secure the financial 
markets—oh, and, by the way, the Fed-
eral Reserve. We are taking back $430 
billion from the Federal Reserve in 
this piece of legislation—$430 billion 
from the Federal Reserve—funded to 
the max. Wall Street—funded to the 
max. 
But I say again: Wall Street, capital, 
the financial markets—they are not 
the foundation of this economy. The 
working people of this Nation, the 
working people of Missouri, the work-
ing people of our other States—they 
are the foundation of this economy, 
and it is time that they were put first— 
first for COVID relief, first in our eco-
nomic policy, first in all that we do. 
So I hope that this effort to get them 
direct assistance will be the beginning 
of a larger effort to orient our eco-
nomic policy and the policy of this Na-
tion around the strength and the inde-
pendence and the needs of our great 
working Americans. 
I want to end by saying thank you to 
them, thank you to the working people 
of Missouri who have endured through 
this crisis day in and day out, who have 
gone to work as essential workers, who 
have taken care of children at home, 
who have missed shifts at work in 
order to care for loved ones, who have 
contributed food to others in need even 
when they didn’t have enough food for 
themselves, who have gone without in 
order to see that their children could 
eat. 
The people of this country, the work-
ing people who have sacrificed again 
and again and again and have borne the 
brunt of this pandemic and have con-
tinued to show up for their families, for

Help is on the way. Help is on the

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
U.S. AFRICAN-AMERICAN BURIAL 
GROUNDS NETWORK ACT 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to discuss S. 2827, the African- 
American 
Burial 
Grounds 
Network 
Act, introduced by Senator ALEXANDER 
from Tennessee and me. 
We know that for too long and in too 
many parts of our country, Black fami-
lies were blocked from burying their 
loved ones in White cemeteries. These 
men and women were freed slaves, civil 
rights champions, veterans, mothers, 
fathers, and active workers in commu-
nities. 
Our bill is simple. It directs the Na-
tional Park Service to conduct a study 
on ways to identify and preserve and 
record unmarked, abandoned, or other 
historic 
African-American 
burial 
grounds. 
We need to act now before these sites 
are lost to the ravages of time or devel-
opment. 
In an op-ed published in the Memphis 
Commercial Appeal, Senator ALEX-
ANDER summed up the need for bills 
like ours: ‘‘Our children need to learn 
more history in order to grow up know-
ing what it means to be an American, 
including our struggle with race.’’ 
For more than two centuries, these 
cemeteries have been looked after by 
churches, community groups, and pri-
vate citizens. I learned about these ef-
forts and the struggle to preserve these 
sacred places when I visited Union Bap-
tist Church in Cincinnati, where pa-
rishioners have worked to preserve 
their hallowed space from vandals and 
the inexorable passage of time. 
The cemetery I visited in Cincinnati 
was founded in 1864. It is a final resting 
place for freed slaves, for Black Union 
soldiers, and for civil rights activists. 
I was there last November on a very 
cold morning, I remember, with Ms. 
Angelita Jones, chair of the trustee 
board for Union Baptist Church, and 
other elected officials in the city and 
members of the church, to announce 
funding to help restore the cemetery. 
But there is more to do at this ceme-
tery and so many more like it across 
the country. 
Our bill will help us better under-
stand the scope and the scale of the 
issue and develop the tools needed to 
help churches, historic organizations, 
and communities to protect these sa-
cred burial grounds. 
I would like to take a minute, as we 
move this legislation forward—and I 
appreciate the cooperation of the peo-
ple on all sides—to thank Senator 
ALEXANDER for his help with this bill. 
In fact, almost 3 years ago to the day— 
it was almost exactly this day; I be-
lieve it was December 21, 2017—our bill 
to create an African American Civil 
Rights Network passed this Chamber. 
His interest in and awareness of pro-
tecting and preserving our history and 
the contributions to it by all Ameri-
cans are so important. 
He has been a champion for so many 
issues that I have had the pleasure to 
work with him on over the years, from 
protecting the Smokey Mountains to 
STEM education, to helping me find 
funding for cleanup efforts at a former 
uranium enrichment plant in Southern 
Ohio. His willingness to work across 
the aisle and to work in good faith for 
an agreeable compromise will surely be 
missed. We all regret his retirement 
and thank him for amazing service. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources be discharged from further con-
sideration of S. 2827 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 2827) to amend title 54, United 
States Code, to establish within the National 
Park Service the U.S. African-American 
Burial Grounds Network, and for other pur-
poses. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Brown 
substitute amendment be agreed to and 
the bill, as amended, be considered 
read a third time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 2721) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to, as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following:

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, earlier 
today, the minority leader came down 
to the Senate floor and unfortunately 
once again mischaracterized both the 
objectives and motives of Senate Re-
publicans in the pursuit of the changes 
we wanted to make with respect to the 
CARES Act emergency lending pro-
gram, and I want to address that. But 
let me just say candidly that I under-
stand his frustration. Republicans to-
gether set out four goals for the coun-
try with respect to these programs, and 
we achieved all four goals. I guess that 
is a little bit frustrating. 
Let me go through just a little bit of 
recent history on this. Let’s remember 
that this debate has been going on for 
several months. The Democrats’ origi-
nal position was to keep these pro-
grams in place. In fact, many of them 
wanted to expand them. They certainly 
wanted to extend them well past the 
end of the year. How do we know that? 
Well, among other ways, Senator SCHU-
MER himself sent a letter to Secretary 
Mnuchin and Chairman Powell asking 
exactly that—that they extend these 
programs. 
You might wonder, why would they 
want to extend an emergency lending 
facility when we are clearly not in an 
emergency in terms of the financial 
markets? The reason is that a lot of 
Democrats had other purposes in mind 
for these programs, and in my view, 
those other purposes would have con-
stituted a terrible misuse of those pro-
grams. 
One of the goals clearly was to kind 
of morph the Fed’s Municipal Liquidity 
Facility into a bailout fund for States

December 20, 2020 
and municipalities. How do we know 
that? Well, because the Democrat-con-
trolled House passed a bill that would 
require that. There is no mystery here. 
They passed a bill that specifically 
would require the Fed to use the Mu-
nicipal Liquidity Facility to bail out 
States and municipalities under out-
rageous terms: ultra-low interest rates, 
ultra-long-term loans, 25 basis point in-
terest rate, 10 years. States wouldn’t 
even need to attest, as they do under 
current law, that they were unable to 
secure credit elsewhere. 
Basically, they wanted to turn the 
Fed from the lender of last resort to 
the lender of first resort. So they were 
clear about that. There are many 
Democratic activists and folks here 
who are sympathetic with them who 
have other purposes as well, such as 
using the Corporate Credit Facility as 
a way to coerce the behavior they want 
from corporations. It wasn’t about ex-
tending credit to companies that need 
credit; it is about achieving a social or 
cultural or political objective by at-
taching terms to the loans that would 
result from that. 
Those are the kinds of uses that 
many on their side had. How do we 
know that? Well, among other things, 
they beat us up almost every day for 
not voting on the Heroes Act. I think 
they intended to vote for it, so they 
would have been voting for this very 
misuse. 
So our goal was simple. Our goal as a 
conference or the consensus of Repub-
lican Senators was to end these pro-
grams consistent with the intent of the 
law and, in fact, I believe, the letter of 
the law, prevent the misuse, and make 
sure the Fed’s legitimate functions are 
not impinged upon. How are we going 
to do this? We are going to do this with 
four specific steps, four specific goals 
that would allow us to achieve that 
outcome for the American people. 
No. 1, sweep the unused money out of 
those accounts and repurpose it; use it 
for other, better purposes. We have 
other needs. That is an important ob-
jective. It also makes sure that the 
money is not available for misuse, if we 
are shifting it out of these facilities 
and putting it to good use. 
Now, again, initially the Democratic 
position was in opposition to this, but 
to their credit, the bipartisan group of 
eight folks who got together and really 
were the catalyst for the bill that we 
are working on now—the Republicans 
persuaded the Democrats to accept this 
idea that the money should be swept 
out, and to the credit of the Democrats 
there, they agreed. So that became the 
basis or one of the bases of this piece of 
legislation that we have been working 
on, and it achieves Republicans’ first 
goal. 
The second goal is to end the pro-
grams as the statute intended. As I 
say, I believe the statute achieves that, 
but there is a very aggressive interpre-
tation to the contrary. We know that 
Senator SCHUMER
wanted to extend 
these programs well beyond the end of 
the year. We know it from his letter 
that he wrote. But, to his credit, he ul-
timately relented, and Republicans 
achieved our second goal. 
The third goal that we had was to 
make sure that these programs aren’t 
simply resuscitated next year. We all 
know there is going to be a new Sec-
retary of the Treasury, and a joint de-
cision by the Treasury Secretary and 
the Fed is what governs this program. 
Now, I don’t think they would have the 
legal authority to resume this, but 
many of our Democratic colleagues 
openly advocated that despite the fact 
that Secretary Mnuchin and Powell 
had agreed not to extend these pro-
grams, that a new Treasury Secretary 
should, in fact, resume these programs, 
start them up again. We said no, and 
again, to the credit of our Democratic 
colleagues, they relented, and Repub-
licans achieved our third goal. 
The fourth was simply to forbid the 
creation of a clone that would cir-
cumvent the third; right? If you had to 
end a particular lending facility, but 
you could just create an identical 
version of it or a nearly identical 
version of it and call it something else, 
why, that would defeat the purpose of 
ending the one you ended. So we need-
ed, in statute, to make it clear that 
there would be a prohibition against 
the creation of a clone or a near clone. 
This one, Senator SCHUMER fought us 
hard on. I will say he fought us hard on 
this. In the course of exchanges, we 
kept getting documents that didn’t 
have any reference to this at all, but in 
the end, he agreed that we would have 
this prohibition. 
We then went back and forth on the 
exact language, exactly what would 
constitute a clone, as I am using the 
term, and what wouldn’t. We got to an 
agreement, and we achieved our fourth 
goal. 
I want to commend my Democratic 
colleagues for working with us to get 
here. It wasn’t easy, and I know there 
is a lot in this that they don’t love 
about this, but with respect to these 
really important goals for the Amer-
ican people, we are making progress. 
One of the other things that I just 
have to address because the leader 
brought this up in his comments ear-
lier was a terrible misrepresentation of 
what our objective was or why did we 
think it was so important to end these 
programs in the first place. 
Our intent was not, as Senator SCHU-
MER implied on the floor today, to sab-
otage the incoming administration’s 
ability to stabilize the economy. And 
that is a direct quote. That was not our 
intent. So what was our intent? Well, 
first, I mentioned earlier we think it is 
important that you follow the law, and 
we believe the law requires that these 
be shut down. We understand there was 
going to be an aggressive attempt to 
circumvent that by interpreting the 
law differently, so we felt, clarify the 
statute, make it unambiguous, and we 
would achieve that. 
The second thing is, of course, it is 
completely consistent with congres-
sional intent. Let me say that I was 
one of the two Republican Senators in 
the room when we were negotiating 
this part of the CARES Act with our 
Democratic 
counterparts, 
Secretary 
Mnuchin, our respective staffs, and at-
torneys. There was nobody in the room 
who thought for a minute that these 
were meant to be indefinite programs. 
Remember where we were. We were 
absolutely 
convinced—and 
I 
think 
rightly—that we were on the verge of a 
full-blown financial crisis, a meltdown 
in the financial markets. If that had 
happened, it is very likely we would 
have had a full-blown depression that 
could have lasted a very, very long 
time. Credit markets were freezing. 
Companies couldn’t borrow. Do you 
know what that means when that hap-
pens to a business? They can’t make 
payroll. If they can’t access credit, if 
they can’t borrow, draw down on a 
bank facility or issue their commercial 
paper or issue their corporate bond, if 
they can’t raise the credit they need, 
they can’t pay their bills. When the 
credit markets freeze up and businesses 
can’t pay their bills, including payroll, 
you have a full-blown, unmitigated dis-
aster. That is what we wanted to pre-
vent. 
The purpose of these facilities was 
narrow. It was to restore the normal 
functioning of the private lending and 
capital markets of America. The pur-
pose was never to replace those mar-
kets. The purpose was never to pick 
winners and losers and decide which 
companies and industries should get fa-
vorable terms and which should not. It 
was none of those things. And it was 
very much not intended to be some 
kind of all-purpose cure-all for what-
ever economic ills there are. None of 
that. The purpose was always to ensure 
that creditworthy borrowers could ac-
cess credit through normal channels. 
Well, guess what. It worked. It 
worked better than we could have 
imagined, better than I was even hop-
ing, 
because 
within 
days—within 
days—credit 
markets 
were 
flowing 
again because lenders had the con-
fidence that, through these facilities, 
the markets would not collapse, there 
would not be a freezing up, they would 
be able to function, and therefore they 
had the confidence to make that loan 
to that company that needed to make 
its payroll and all the other innumer-
able transactions that have to take 
place. 
In fact, it worked so well that as of 
now, I think, total credit has flown at 
an alltime record pace in the United 
States of America. Corporate bond 
issuance is off the charts. High credit, 
lower credit, debt and equity—the cap-
ital markets have been flowing. Credit 
lines from banks have been flowing. 
The programs achieved their limited 
purpose extremely well. 
Now, look, are there other economic 
needs in America? Absolutely. I mean, 
there are industries that have been 
devastated—the restaurant industry, 
hotels, transportation. We know that,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7862 
December 20, 2020 
and we have legislation that is at-
tempting to address many of those 
issues with forgivable loans and an in-
crease in unemployment benefits and 
other provisions. It is here on the Sen-
ate floor, through legislation like that, 
that we should decide how, whether, 
and to what extent we are going to ad-
dress those problems. That is our job— 
to do it through an appropriation proc-
ess here in the Senate. That is not the 
job of the Fed. 
That brings me to another really im-
portant reason why we didn’t want 
these programs to continue indefi-
nitely, and that is to protect the Fed 
from being politicized, to preserve the 
independence of the Fed, which is very, 
very important. 
If the Fed ever became simply an ex-
tension of one of the political parties, 
we would be in a very, very bad place. 
But think about it. If these programs 
were going to continue indefinitely and 
our Democratic colleagues got their 
wish that is represented in the Heroes 
Act—to have massive subsidies for mu-
nicipalities—think about the amount 
of political pressure on the Fed to bail 
out whoever is the preferred con-
stituent of the day: private or public, 
municipal or business. 
Just think about how it would be 
used, and think about the strings that 
they would—they have advocated this. 
Many of our Democratic colleagues 
have said: This could be a way to en-
courage unionization or encourage the 
composition of the Board to look like 
we would like it to look. 
It is an endless list, and it is all wild-
ly inappropriate for the central bank of 
America to be engaged in this kind of 
thing. You should never put the Fed in 
the position of the incredible political 
pressure that they would have been 
under. 
So with this bill—and I hope we are 
able to vote on this, if not today then 
tomorrow. There are some things in 
this bill—unrelated things—that I like. 
I do think we need another round of 
PPP loans. I do think we need the ex-
panded eligibility for unemployment 
benefits, for instance. Here are things I 
don’t like. I think direct payments to 
people who have not suffered a loss of 
income makes no sense whatsoever. 
But this topic I have been discussing— 
the end of these 13(3) lending facilities 
is a very important part of the bill that 
I like very much. 
There are four important objectives 
we set out, and we achieved them: 
sweeping the money out; shutting 
down existing facilities, the four exist-
ing CARES-funded facilities; forbidding 
their reopening without the consent of 
Congress; and forbidding clones from 
being an end-run around that—all 
without impinging on the Fed’s ability 
to intervene in the markets in emer-
gency circumstances. Those were our 
objectives. 
In 
this 
legislation, 
we 
achieve all four of those objectives. I 
would say that is a good day’s work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Mr. President, I want 
to 
commend 
Senator 
TOOMEY
and 
thank him for his expertise, for his 
foresight, and for his courage on the 
issue of ending these CARES Act-fund-
ed Federal Reserve programs. 
You have probably seen that over the 
last few days, he has been subjected to 
an onslaught of vicious, dishonest at-
tacks by Democrats and their stenog-
raphers in the Press Gallery, saying 
that he was somehow gumming up the 
works, that we were not going to pass 
this bill because the Toomey language 
was stopping it. Nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth. 
First off, while Senator TOOMEY may 
be our thought leader on this issue, 
this was the Senate Republican con-
ference’s position. That is why our ma-
jority leader stood firm behind it. 
Second, as Senator TOOMEY said, this 
is not a new issue; this is not some-
thing we just started debating. We had 
versions of this in our bill this sum-
mer. As he laid out, the minority lead-
er and the Speaker of the House had a 
version of it in their $3.4 trillion this 
summer as well. The minority leader 
sent a letter about it. This has been at 
the heart of this legislation’s debate 
for months. And the fact that it was in 
their legislation, it was in their let-
ter—they kept saying that we wanted 
to somehow sabotage the economic re-
covery—just goes to show you what 
their intents were with these pro-
grams. It was to use them, as Senator 
TOOMEY said, as political slush funds; 
use them to bail out—I don’t know— 
New York State or the city of New 
York; use them to impose politically 
correct policies on companies that 
could come to the Fed and get low- or 
no-interest-rate loans if they danced to 
the woke left’s tune. 
Senator TOOMEY and Senate Repub-
licans drew the line on this. We drew 
the line on politicizing the Fed. We had 
no intent whatsoever to harm the Fed’s 
background ability to take emergency 
action, and we will be prepared in the 
future, as Congresses in the past have 
been, in an economic crisis to act as 
well, just like we have twice in the last 
12 years—2008 and 2020. 
But nothing you have read in the 
news about Senator TOOMEY and his 
language that he carried on behalf of 
the 
Senate 
Republican 
conference 
could be further from the truth. I want 
to thank him for standing strong, and 
I want to thank the majority leader for 
standing strong on this as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, for 
the information of all Senators—and, 
more importantly, for the American 
people—we can finally report what our 
Nation has needed to hear for a very 
long time: More help is on the way. 
Moments ago, in consultation with 
our committees, the four leaders of the 
Senate and House finalized an agree-
ment. There will be another major res-
cue package for the American people. 
As our citizens continue battling this 
coronavirus this holiday season, they 
will not be fighting alone. 
We have agreed to a package of near-
ly $900 billion. It is packed with tar-
geted policies to help struggling Amer-
icans who have already waited entirely 
too long. For workers at the hardest 
hit small businesses, there will be a 
targeted second draw of the Paycheck 
Protection Program. We have not 
worked so hard to save as many jobs as 
possible, all these months, only to fum-
ble the ball with vaccinations already 
underway. 
Speaking of vaccines, we can’t nul-
lify the success of Operation Warp 
Speed by falling asleep at the switch on 
distribution. This agreement will pro-
vide huge sums for the logistics that 
will get these lifesaving shots to our 
citizens as fast as possible. 
Of course, many millions of Ameri-
cans have lost their jobs—and are con-
tinuing to lose them—through no fault 
of their own. This package will renew 
and extend a number of the additional 
important Federal unemployment ben-
efits that have helped families stay 
afloat. 
Across all kinds of families, in all 
kinds of situations, this has been a dif-
ficult time across the board. So, at the 
particular request and emphasis of 
President Trump and his administra-
tion, our agreement will provide an-
other round of direct impact payments 
to help households make ends meet and 
continue our economic recovery. 
We all know this crisis has tested our 
healthcare providers. This legislation 
will continue to fund the frontlines. 
But the crisis in American education 
has been staggering as well. So this 
package will supply millions and mil-
lions of dollars to help get kids back in 
school and to do so safely. 
These are just some of the key com-
ponents. There are many more. And 
importantly, we are going to supply 
this emergency aid in a way that is 
smart and responsible. We will be 
repurposing more than $560 billion in 
money that was already set aside by 
the CARES Act—but not spent—toward 
these urgent needs that I have out-
lined. 
We will be appropriately paring back 
some of the most expansive powers 
that 
Congress 
temporarily 
gave 
unelected officials to stabilize the fi-
nancial system back in the springtime. 
And I want to particularly thank Sen-
ator TOOMEY for his extraordinary con-
tribution to that effort. 
At long last, we have the bipartisan 
breakthrough the country has needed. 
Now we need to promptly finalize text, 
avoid any last-minute obstacles, and 
cooperate to move this legislation 
through both Chambers. 
This is good news. But I need to close 
with one observation that is regret-
table. From where I stand, from where 
Senate Republicans stand, there is no 
reason this urgent package could not 
have been signed into law multiple 
months ago—multiple months ago.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7863 
December 20, 2020 
For 
months, 
Senate 
Republicans 
have consistently supported a targeted 
rescue package, under $1 trillion, fo-
cused on the same kinds of policies 
that we have actually settled on today. 
As far back as July, and all autumn, 
Republicans 
have 
consistently sup-
ported a targeted package right in the 
ballpark of this total amount, with ex-
actly the same kinds of policies in the 
mix. 
The package that will shortly be-
come law falls exactly within the ball-
park of what Senate Republicans have 
been proposing and trying to pass since 
last summer. This is eerily similar to 
what we were trying to pass last sum-
mer. 
Compare the shape of this major 
agreement with the shape of what I 
proposed all the way back in late July. 
Yes, some fine details are different. 
There is no doubt this new agreement 
contains input from our Democratic 
colleagues. It is, of course, bipartisan. 
But those matters could have been set-
tled a long time ago as well. 
Why did it take all this time? We 
know why. We have heard Democrats 
say openly that they were not willing 
to deal all summer and fall but are 
willing 
now—willing 
now—because 
they have a President-elect of their 
own political party. That is not my ac-
cusation; that is their admission. They 
have been pretty candid about it. 
So, look, I am glad we have gotten 
this done. My Democratic colleagues 
and I have had good discussions this 
past week. Both parties have a lot to 
be proud of. But I really regret that 
some on the Democratic side decided 
that partisan Presidential politics were 
more important than getting urgent 
and noncontroversial relief out the 
door much sooner to families who have 
needed this help badly. 
The progress of this past week could 
have happened in July or August or 
September or October. Senate Repub-
licans were advocating for a package 
just like this one all along in realtime. 
I just wish our partners on the other 
side had put political calculations 
aside and worked with us to make this 
happen a long time ago. 
However, with that said, I appreciate 
the earnest conversations of this past 
week. I want to thank the Democratic 
leader, Speaker PELOSI, Leader MCCAR-
THY, as well as, in particular, Secretary 
Mnuchin, who has been tireless in 
these discussions throughout. Both 
sides, in both Chambers, have really 
stepped up and worked hard to get this 
done. 
We will be moving forward with the 
start of the pandemic relief and full- 
year funding legislation for the Federal 
Government, as well, and I hope we can 
do this as promptly as possible. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, after 
weeks of intense bipartisan negotia-
tion, the leadership of both Chambers, 
as well as the White House, have 
reached an agreement on an emergency 
Federal relief package. The agreement 
on this package could be summed up by 
the 
expression 
‘‘better 
late 
than 
never,’’ although I know many of my 
Republican colleagues wished it was 
never. 
After a long and arduous year, after a 
year full of bad news, finally, we have 
some good news to deliver to the Amer-
ican people. Make no mistake about it, 
this agreement is far from perfect, but 
it will deliver emergency relief to a na-
tion in the throes of a genuine emer-
gency. 
It should have the votes to pass the 
Senate, the House, and reach the Presi-
dent’s desk to become law. We should 
make that happen as soon as possible— 
as soon as possible—even tonight, if we 
can. 
By all rights, a bill of this urgency 
should have passed 8 months—should 
have passed months ago. The country 
needed it. 
But we all know what happened. The 
Republican majority caused more than 
8 months of delays and gridlock. Twen-
ty Members of the Senate majority 
wanted no money. And what the Re-
publican leader simply forgets, for 
months, he said: Let’s examine the cri-
sis; let’s put it on pause, while Demo-
crats were demanding more action. 
And then when he produced legisla-
tion, it didn’t have what was needed 
and had poison pills, a provision that 
would give all corporations—no matter 
how egregious their behavior—immu-
nity and nothing to help the unem-
ployed, no direct checks. 
So the idea that this delay was 
caused by Democrats is ‘‘Alice in Won-
derland’’ history. It was caused by a 
Republican majority that didn’t want 
to vote for the moneys desperately 
needed by the American people. The 
significance of this package, even 
though it is not as large or robust as it 
should be, should not be underesti-
mated. We will deliver the second larg-
est Federal stimulus in our Nation’s 
history. Only the CARES Act will have 
been bigger—only the CARES Act, 
which I was proud to negotiate with 
Secretary Mnuchin. 
In size and scope, this bill will exceed 
the Recovery Act passed in the after-
math of the financial crisis. And once 
this Federal relief bill is signed into 
law, Congress will have allocated well 
over $3 trillion in relief this year alone. 
That is a historic figure to match a 
historic crisis. It will give the new 
President a boost—a head start—as he 
prepares to right our ailing economy. 
The economy is in a deep, deep hole be-
cause of President Trump and the Re-
publican Senate’s failure to act in a 
timely manner. 
But this, at least, begins us getting 
the relief the American people need so 
that when President Biden takes over, 
he can do more and help us dig out of 
this deep hole. 
And the good news, too, the poison 
pills that so stopped any progress put 
in by the majority leader are not in 
this bill. It won’t include any provision 
to limit the legal rights of workers who 
were put in harm’s way or any provi-
sion to gratuitously limit the author-
ity of the Fed. 
Now, it is remarkable how far we 
have come. As I mentioned earlier, this 
summer, the Republican leader admit-
ted 20 Members of his caucus didn’t 
want to vote for another dime of 
COVID relief. Before negotiating with 
Democrats, the majority offered a 
package of $500 billion that contained 
poison pills designed to doom the thing 
from the start. That way, Republican 
Senators wouldn’t be forced to approve 
any new spending. Here at the end of 
the year, reason has prevailed—sweet 
reason—and we will now deliver a 
package of almost a trillion dollars. 
That matters not for any one party. 
It matters for the American people be-
cause we increased the size of this bill, 
expanded its reach. More Americans 
will receive assistance before the holi-
days. For Americans who have lost 
their jobs through no fault of their 
own, this bill will throw out a safety 
net. 
Initially, Republicans were ready to 
let enhanced unemployment benefits 
expire. They were ready to move on 
without help for renters. They opposed 
another round of direct payments. 
Their starting offer for UI and rent re-
lief was zero, zero, and zero again. 
The good news that transcends any of 
the obstacles that we faced is that in 
the final agreement, we will extend all 
three Federal unemployment programs 
created under CARES. We will provide 
$300 in weekly Federal unemployment 
benefits for the next 10 weeks. For fam-
ilies struggling to make ends meet, 
this bill will cushion the blow. 
A new round of survival checks will 
soon be on the way—$600 per adult, an-
other $600 for every dependent in the 
household. Many of us would have 
liked that to be higher, but at least 
this is the quickest way to get money 
into pockets of the American people, 
sending their tax dollars right back 
where they came from. Of course, as I 
said, it is not as much as many Demo-
crats and some Republicans would have 
liked, and we hope that next year the 
same bipartisan support that emerged 
behind $1,200 stimulus checks will pro-
vide even more assistance to working 
families. 
For the first time ever during this 
pandemic, Congress will provide $25 bil-
lion in direct rental assistance to help 
reduce the burden on Americans who 
have fallen behind on their rent. We 
also extend a moratorium on evictions 
to give our fellow citizens more time to 
get back on their feet. 
For small business owners, we are 
providing businesses the opportunity 
to take another draw of the popular

Paycheck Protection Program. Cru-
cially, this bill will provide $12 billion 
for minority-owned and very small 
businesses that struggled to access fi-
nancing during the earlier rounds of 
PPP. 
Local 
newspapers 
and 
local 
broadcasters will have access to this 
assistance as well as nonprofits—I 
worked very hard to see that this hap-
pened—and our nonprofit religious in-
stitutions. Our churches and our syna-
gogues and our mosques—no collection 
plate, no income, but so vital to social 
services and so needed during a time of 
crisis—will, once again, get the help 
they need—something that I authored 
in the CARES bill. 
I am especially pleased that this bill 
will provide money for bars and res-
taurants and $15 billion in SBA grants 
for theater operators and small venue 
owners through the Save Our Stages 
Act. These venues are so important to 
my State and many States across the 
country. They are the lifeblood of our 
communities. They were first to close 
and will be the last to open. This bill 
gives them a fighting chance. 
Of course, today’s agreement will 
give a major boost to our battle 
against the disease itself. There will be 
more than $30 billion to support the 
procurement and distribution of the 
coronavirus vaccine, ensuring that it is 
free and rapidly distributed to every-
one. 
Today’s agreement includes all this 
and more—support for childcare, food 
assistance, 
agricultural 
relief, 
the 
Postal Service, and funding to help 
families gain access to broadband. So 
the American people have a great deal 
to celebrate in this legislation, but, of 
course, the agreement we reached is far 
from perfect. It leaves out direct State 
and local assistance. Despite desperate 
pleas from Governors, mayors, and 
economists across the spectrum, the 
Republicans stubbornly refused to pro-
vide direct aid to State and local gov-
ernments. Over a million public em-
ployees have already lost their jobs. It 
doesn’t matter if you are working for a 
small business and get laid off or if you 
are working for a government and are 
laid off; you still need to feed your 
family. So why is there such a dif-
ference on this side of the aisle be-
tween these same people—flesh and 
blood? Because some work for the gov-
ernment, they don’t get help, but be-
cause some work for a small business, 
they do. Both should get help. 
State revenues, of course, are signifi-
cantly down across the country in 
States red and blue. The continued op-
position to State and local funding 
from the Republicans remains deeply 
irresponsible. It will force States to 
make painful decisions to cut jobs and 
potentially raise taxes on working fam-
ilies, and it will hurt the economy of 
the entire country as millions more 
government workers are laid off at a 
time when we are struggling to re-
cover—hurting us all. 
Still, the Democrats refused to let 
State and local governments be com-
pletely left behind. Today’s agreement 
does include aid for specific State-level 
expenses—$82 
billion 
for 
education 
funding, $27 billion in payments for 
testing and State healthcare programs, 
$45 billion for transit systems. I am 
very proud of the fact that New York’s 
MTA will receive the money it needs to 
keep going. It is so vital to our city’s 
economy and something I worked very 
hard for. 
Make 
no 
mistake—these 
funding 
sources are not a replacement for di-
rect aid to State and local govern-
ments, and we Democrats will continue 
to fight for those in the new year. But 
in this case, a rose by any other name 
smells not quite as sweet, but at least 
it brings some relief. State and local 
governments will receive assistance in 
a number of different ways. 
When this Chamber gavels back in in 
2021, we must pick up where we just 
left off. We have given the administra-
tion a vital headstart, but make no 
mistake about it—our economy is in a 
deep, deep, deep hole, in part, because 
of the Trump administration’s lack of 
policy in fighting the coronavirus. Now 
we will have to help them. This is a 
good start, but a lot more needs to be 
done. We must continue to protect peo-
ple’s jobs whether they work for a com-
pany or a local government. We must 
do so much more, and we have to start 
building and stimulating our economy 
so it gets out of the hole with things 
like infrastructure and wiring every 
home with broadband and improving 
our healthcare and education systems 
and so much more—so much more. 
Let me be very, very clear about one 
thing. Once this deal is signed into law, 
it cannot be the final word on congres-
sional relief. There is more to do in the 
new year with a new administration 
that has a much more favorable atti-
tude toward giving the American peo-
ple the help they need. The bipartisan 
agreement is simply a downpayment. It 
will establish a floor, not a ceiling, for 
coronavirus relief in 2021. 
Over the course of this challenging 
year, tens of millions of Americans 
have been pushed close to the breaking 
point. They have lost their jobs. They 
have lost their homes. Many can’t feed 
their families. Many have lost neigh-
bors, colleagues, friends, and family to 
this vicious, vicious disease. They have 
such great pain—a pain that we can 
only distantly empathize with because 
it hasn’t happened directly to us here. 
As the pandemic enters its worst 
phase, we will continue to be isolated 
from one another, but behind closed 
doors, desperation mounts for millions 
and millions of our fellow Americans. 
This bill is for them—for them—to 
carry them to a brighter day. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HOEVEN). The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, first, 
I am delighted that we are finally at 
the point at which we are passing legis-
lation to deal with the COVID–19 crisis 
that has gripped my State and our 
country. We have a healthcare pan-
demic, and we have an economic crisis. 
I am pleased to say that, on a bipar-
tisan basis, we are now coming to-
gether as we did 9 months ago with the 
CARES Act. It shouldn’t have been 9 
months, but we now have a targeted 
bill that focuses on providing a bridge 
between now and the time at which the 
vaccines will be widely available. We 
need the help. The economy is fal-
tering, as was just said, but also the 
healthcare crisis in my home State and 
in so many other places has gotten 
worse. So it is past time. 
I am told I have given 21 speeches on 
the floor about the bipartisan nature of 
this. There are so many areas of com-
mon ground, and I was pleased to be 
part of the 10-person bipartisan group 
who put together our own package over 
the last month. I think that helped to 
encourage leaders on both sides to see 
that there was a lot of common ground, 
that there were ways for us to come to-
gether. 
One of my colleagues is on the floor 
with me now, Senator STABENOW
of 
Michigan. She is one of those Demo-
crats whom I spoke to over a month 
ago about this bipartisan process, and 
we talked about the common ground 
and the ability for us to find ways to 
move ahead to help those small busi-
nesses that truly are struggling; indi-
viduals who, through no fault of their 
own, lost their jobs because of the eco-
nomic crisis that was precipitated by 
the pandemic; and to help our schools 
and to help our healthcare providers 
and to help ensure that we are doing 
what we can here to help at the local 
level to respond to this crisis. 
f 
GREAT LAKES RESTORATION 
INITIATIVE ACT OF 2019 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
on the floor tonight to join my col-
league Senator STABENOW of Michigan 
to ask our colleagues to support legis-
lation that has to do with the Great 
Lakes. It is called the Great Lakes 
Restoration Initiative. We are asking 
to reauthorize that legislation. 
This is one of those public-private 
partnerships that work. It is not only 
public, like Federal public, and private; 
it is Federal, State, local, and private 
individuals coming together to figure 
out how to keep our Great Lakes the 
amazing treasure that they are. 
I represent Lake Erie. It is on the 
north coast of Ohio. It is the most shal-
low and also the most fertile of the 
Great Lakes. It has incredible fishing. 
There is a gigantic, $7 billion fishing 
industry in the Great Lakes. A lot of it 
is recreational fishing—$7 billion. It is 
being threatened right now, really, by 
a few different things. One is these 
Asian carp, so-called ‘‘bighead carp,’’ 
that are coming up into the lake. We 
are doing all we can to keep them out, 
but this funding, the Great Lakes Res-
toration Initiative, focuses on that 
issue to keep the carp from ruining 
Lake Erie as they have ruined other

bodies of water for recreational and 
commercial fishing. 
Second, we have to deal with our 
toxic algae blooms. You have probably 
heard about this. We have these blooms 
that are increasingly forming in Lake 
Erie, particularly in the western basin 
of the Toledo area. What they do is 
they keep people from being able to use 
the lake. You don’t want to swim in it. 
By the way, you don’t even want your 
dog to swim in it because the dogs can 
actually be injured by this. You don’t 
want to fish in it, of course, and you 
really can’t. 
I have gone fishing in the Great 
Lakes every year for the past many 
years. I love the Great Lakes. Part of 
my childhood was on the Great Lakes. 
When I was a little kid, with my dad, I 
went fishing on the Great Lakes. You 
really can’t fish when the algae blooms 
come in because they are so thick, you 
literally can’t get a lure or bait 
through the algae blooms, and your 
boat has a tough time getting through 
them. 
This is a serious issue. At one point, 
it got so serious in the western basin 
that it actually affected the water sup-
ply for the city of Toledo. So several 
years ago, we had to stop the city 
water in Toledo. I remember going 
there, with my pickup truck full of 
bottles of water, to help hand out 
water 
because 
people—particularly 
moms with babies—couldn’t use the 
water. They were told: Don’t allow 
your babies to have formula made from 
the water in the faucet because it is 
too dangerous, too toxic, because these 
algae blooms had gotten into the water 
system. 
That is how scary this is if we don’t 
ensure that we are taking efforts at 
every level—State, local, in the private 
sector, and at the Federal. Lake Erie 
and the other Great Lakes now provide 
drinking water for 40 million people. 
You want to be sure that treasure con-
tinues, not just for recreation and fish-
ing and swimming and so on but also 
for the water supply for so many Amer-
icans. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive is a downpayment, really, to en-
sure that we can deal with these 
invasive species like the Asian carp 
and others. It is to ensure that we can 
deal with the toxic algae blooms and 
the erosion that is occurring as the 
water level has gone up and also some 
pollution issues that remain in Lake 
Erie and in all the Great Lakes. 
The Great Lakes Restoration Initia-
tive works. I have been to about 10 of 
these sights all around Ohio, and I have 
gone often with people from the private 
sector and the local community and 
sometimes the State government, and 
we talk about how, again, this is a 
model partnership. 
As an example, I was at a farm in 
northwest Ohio, where, instead of tell-
ing them, ‘‘Hey, you have to stop farm-
ing because you are putting nitrogen 
and phosphorus into the creek that 
goes by your farm, and that is going 
into the Maumee River, and that is 
going into Lake Erie and causing these 
algae blooms to grow,’’ I asked, ‘‘Hey, 
how can we work with you as a farmer 
to try to reduce your runoff?’’ 
We have had great success in that, 
but there is some expense in it. Often, 
you have to provide for filters and 
pumps and so on to keep this from 
going into the water supply and deal-
ing with these upstream issues with re-
gard to algae blooms and phosphorus 
nitrogen. 
So I am pleased to say that, as of to-
night, it appears that we have passed 
this on both sides of the Chamber 
through a so-called hotline. We had to 
work with some of our colleagues to re-
solve some remaining questions that 
they had for which we had answers be-
cause this is a program that works, and 
I have seen it work. 
I am really pleased to have partnered 
with Senator STABENOW. We are co-
chairs of the Great Lakes Task Force. 
She is the Democratic cochair, and I 
am the Republican cochair, and to-
night I have partnered with her on this 
legislation. I thank her for her friend-
ship, her work on this issue, and her 
passion for the Great Lakes. 
I would like, if I could, to now turn 
to Senator STABENOW. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is 
always wonderful to work with my 
friend and colleague from Ohio, and 
certainly we share a tremendous part-
nership and passion about our Great 
Lakes. 
For us in Michigan, we are a penin-
sula. We are surrounded by the Great 
Lakes, and we really believe it is about 
our way of life. My friend has talked 
about the fishing industry and the 
boating industry. There are 40 million 
people who get their drinking water 
from the Great Lakes Basin. We have 
more lighthouses all around Michigan, 
actually, than any other shoreline has 
in the country. We say we have the 
ocean without the salt, and it is very 
much in our DNA for us in Michigan. 
As the Senator from Ohio indicated, 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
focuses on a number of things that deal 
with water quality, stopping the spread 
of Asian carp and other invasive spe-
cies, and restoring the shoreline from 
any future contaminations. 
I have to say, as a personal point of 
pride, in 2010, I authored the Great 
Lakes Restoration Initiative as a mem-
ber of the Senate Committee on the 
Budget, and since that time, we have 
funded 5,449 different projects through-
out the entire region of the Great 
Lakes, including 880 projects in Michi-
gan. And we have seen tangible results. 
As Senator PORTMAN has indicated, 
this is a partnership, public-private. It 
is with local communities. It is with 
State governments. It is the Federal 
Government. 
We, in Michigan, have passed four 
areas of concern that have been labeled 
because of the seriousness of what was 
happening to the water and the water 
quality. They have now been removed 
from those areas of concern, where the 
communities worked together using 
Great Lakes Restoration funding and 
working with the communities, and 
they have been delisted, which is a 
good thing. That means things have 
improved. You can fish again. You can 
swim again. You can enjoy the water 
again. And so we are seeing tremen-
dous, tangible results from what we 
have been able to do together. 
And it is also important to note that 
for every $1 we put into investment 
through this important program, it 
produces $3 in economic return. 
So it is fiscally responsible. It is re-
sponsible stewardship for all of us in 
protecting the fresh waters of our 
country. What we are doing in this leg-
islation, basically, would allow us, over 
the next 5 years, to raise the authoriza-
tion level back up to where it started 
in 2010. It has been up and down, and up 
and down, and up and down, and this 
would allow us to be able, within the 
next 5 years, to get that authorization 
back up to where it was. So we do have 
the support of the body. 
Mr. President, as if in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Environment and Public 
Works be discharged from further con-
sideration of H.R. 4031 and the Senate 
proceed to its immediate consider-
ation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 4031) to amend the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act to reauthorize 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, and 
for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 4031) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed. 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
thank you very much. Let me say 
again what a pleasure it is to work 
with my friend from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, one 
other point from Senator STABENOW 
and myself, and that is that we want to 
congratulate and thank our colleagues 
in the House for working with us on 
this Great Lakes Restoration Initiative 
and, in particular, the two cochairs in 
the House from the Great Lakes Task 
Force and the two coauthors of the 
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative leg-
islation. 
That would be Representative MARCY 
KAPTUR
of Ohio and Representative 
DAVID JOYCE from Ohio. We would like 
to thank them for their good work and

congratulate them on tonight’s passage 
as well. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
want to take one other moment just to 
also speak and thank everybody that is 
involved at this point in getting us to 
where we are on this very important 
survival package. 
I have never felt this was a COVID 
stimulus. It is about helping people 
survive over the next several months, 
whether that is making sure they have 
a roof over their head and food on the 
table, can pay the bills, keep the heat 
on. In places like North Dakota and 
places like Ohio, it is going to get pret-
ty cold this winter. Our small busi-
nesses, our farmers, our schools that 
need help to be able to succeed, all the 
support we need to provide for vaccine 
distribution and healthcare, and all of 
the other areas—this has been a tough 
negotiation. 
I do want to say, on a couple of 
points where I have been deeply in-
volved, I want to thank the Presiding 
Officer for his support and help on our 
nutrition and agriculture pieces. We 
have come together in a very impor-
tant step. It is going to allow more 
people to get help to feed their families 
over the next several months—no small 
thing. 
We have a hunger crisis in our coun-
try. We have people who have donated 
to the food bank, worked for the food 
bank, and are now sitting for hours in 
cars, waiting to drive up and get a box 
of food, in the United States of Amer-
ica. 
And so what we are doing as part of 
this package is going to be significant 
to help people be able to purchase food 
in the grocery store, as well as to get 
help in other ways—to help our seniors 
with Meals on Wheels, to help our chil-
dren who aren’t able to eat in school 
right now, and our college students 
who don’t have the opportunity to be 
on campus and get support. 
So we have very significant food ac-
cess and nutrition, very positive efforts 
in this legislation. And for our farmers, 
as well, across the country, there is 
significant support, as well as help in 
our food chain and supply chain areas, 
where we have all been concerned as we 
have watched those involved in the 
supply chain lose their markets in res-
taurants and so on but not have the 
support and the capacity to take that 
milk or take those other commodities 
and be able to move them over and 
package 
them 
differently for con-
sumers to go to the food bank. We 
make some headway in supporting 
that, as well, in this legislation. 
So I want to thank my colleagues. 
This is really the last negotiation that 
Senator ROBERTS and I have led, as he 
retires this year. And it has been, as I 
have said before, a great pleasure to 
work with him and to be able to 
achieve this effort—bipartisan effort. 
The one thank-you I just want to 
give is in a whole other area that has 
been a passion of mine that I have been 
proud to lead with a colleague from 
Missouri, Senator ROY BLUNT. We have 
very significant support, as well, for 
behavioral 
health 
services, 
mental 
health, substance abuse services that 
are desperately needed and have been 
amplified, and the need has been ex-
panded even more because of what has 
happened with the coronavirus. 
And there is important support in 
this legislation, as well, and I am 
grateful to be involved in pushing that 
forward as well. 
So there is more to talk about. I 
know we are a little ways away from 
that final vote, but I am hopeful that 
the coalition that was formed—that all 
of us working together that brought 
this together and negotiated, and my 
colleagues who initiated this bipar-
tisan effort—will find that this is a co-
alition we want to keep going for next 
year, because there is so much more 
that we need to do together, and the 
American people expect us to get 
things done. And this, I hope, is the 
first step of many to celebrate ways 
that we are solving problems and help-
ing people and moving the country for-
ward. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. First of all, I want to 
agree with my colleague from Michi-
gan and thank her for her work con-
cerning behavioral health and working 
with us in a bipartisan group on both 
behavioral health and addiction be-
cause, unfortunately, during this pan-
demic, the epidemic of drug addiction 
and drug overdose and overdose deaths 
has increased dramatically, and it is a 
heartbreaking reality because we were 
making progress, thanks to work here 
in this Chamber and in the States. 
Around the country, we were actually 
reducing not just the number of people 
addicted but the number of people who 
were suffering from overdose and over-
dose deaths. 
Unfortunately, this year we are now 
going to see the largest overdose death 
rate in the history of our country, we 
believe. That is a sad reality, and we 
need to address it—that is part of the 
COVID–19 package—along with the be-
havioral health issues that are also, 
unfortunately, being exacerbated by 
the isolation that comes with the 
COVID–19 issue and the helpless, prob-
ably, and the joblessness that we have 
been seeing. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
JOHNSON). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
AMENDING THE GRAND RONDE 
RESERVATION ACT 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, as if in

consent that the Senate proceed to the 
immediate consideration of Calendar

‘‘(ii) an anthropogenic cause; 
‘‘(iii) a combination of a natural cause and an 
anthropogenic cause; or 
‘‘(iv) an undetermined cause. 
‘‘(B) REVENUE LOSS THRESHOLDS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall apply 
the following 12-month revenue loss thresholds 
in determining whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred: 
‘‘(I) Losses greater than 80 percent shall result 
in a positive determination that a fishery re-
source disaster has occurred. 
‘‘(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 percent 
shall be evaluated to determine whether a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred, based on the 
information provided or analyzed under para-
graph (4)(B). 
‘‘(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not be 
eligible for a determination that a fishery re-
source disaster has occurred, except where the 
Secretary determines there are extenuating cir-
cumstances that justify using a lower threshold 
in making the determination. 
‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource disaster 
has occurred, the Secretary shall consider the 
economic impacts to the charter fishing industry 
to ensure financial coverage for charter fishing 
businesses.

subsistence opportunity, where appropriate. 
‘‘(C) INELIGIBLE FISHERIES.—A fishery subject 
to overfishing in any of the 3 years preceding 
the date of a determination under this sub-
section is not eligible for a determination of 
whether a fishery resource disaster has occurred 
unless the Secretary determines that overfishing 
was not a contributing factor to the fishery re-
source disaster. 
‘‘(D) EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES.—In an ex-
ceptional circumstance where substantial eco-
nomic impacts to the affected fishery and fish-
ing community have been subject to a disaster 
declaration under another statutory authority, 
such as in the case of a natural disaster or from 
the direct consequences of a Federal action 
taken to prevent, or in response to, a natural 
disaster for purposes of protecting life and safe-
ty, the Secretary may determine a fishery re-
source disaster has occurred without a request 
or without conducting the required analyses in 
subparagraphs (A) and (B). 
‘‘(6) DISBURSAL OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS.— 
‘‘(A) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary shall al-
locate funds available under paragraph (9) for 
fishery resource disasters.

FUNDING
AVAIL-
ABILITY.—When there are appropriated funds 
for 1 or more fishery resource disasters, the Sec-
retary shall notify the public and representa-
tives of affected fishing communities with a 
positive disaster determination that is unfunded

(2) CONTENTS OF STUDY.—The report required 
under paragraph (1) shall include—

aged fisheries for the impacts of climate change;

rine Fisheries Commission, or the National Ma-
rine Fisheries Service to prepare and adapt fish-
ery management for the impacts of climate 
change;

capacity of the National Marine Fisheries Serv-
ice to monitor climate-related changes to fish-
eries and marine ecosystems, to understand the

f 
H.R. 6535 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
rise today to address equitable treat-
ment in Native healthcare. When the 
Senate Committee on Indian Affairs 
considered S. 3650, the companion bill 
to H.R. 6535, I noted the strong history 
of Alaska Natives and Native Hawai-
ians working together to ensure that 
there is parity in Federal policy for all 
Native peoples. Enactment of H.R. 6535 
will address the lack of parity in Fed-
eral urban Indian health programs, and 
by sending this bill to the President, 
the Senate is making a necessary cor-
rection that will support delivery of 
healthcare 
to 
Native 
communities 
across the country. But, as we pass this 
measure, we must not forget that a 
lack of parity continues to persist for 
the Native Hawaiian healthcare Sys-
tems funded through the Native Hawai-
ian Health Care Improvement Act. I 
am therefore committed to standing 
with Senator SCHATZ to ensure that 
Native Hawaiian healthcare systems 
are not left behind and will work with 
him to address the inequitable access 
to Federal Tort Claims Act coverage 
among Native health systems in the 
next Congress. Together, we will con-
tinue to fight for the trust and treaty 
rights and access to benefits for all of 
our country’s Native peoples. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING 
SENATORS 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the end 
of a Congress is a bittersweet time. We 
reflect with pride on our accomplish-
ments but have a sense of wistfulness 
with respect to the things we have been 
unable to do. We look forward to the 
holidays, spending more time with our 
families, and having a bit of a respite. 
But we have to say good-bye to several 
colleagues. I would like to take a few 
moments to pay tribute to Senators 
who will not be returning when the 
117th Congress convenes. They are my 
friends as well as my colleagues and I 
will miss them and the unique at-
tributes, skill, and devotion to public 
service they have brought to the Sen-
ate. 
Senator CORY GARDNER is a fifth gen-
eration Coloradan firmly rooted in the 
State’s Eastern Plains whose family 
has been in the farm implement busi-
ness for over one century. He received 
his undergraduate degree from Colo-
rado State University, where he grad-
uated summa cum laude, and his Juris 
Doctor from the University of Colorado 
at Boulder. 
While Senator GARDNER
has only 
been in the Senate since 2015, the ex-
pression ‘‘got it in one’’ certainly ap-
plies to him. Perhaps that is because 
he previously worked in the Senate for 
then-Senator Wayne Allard, quickly 
rising to become Senator Allard’s leg-
islative director. He served for 6 years 
in the Colorado House of Representa-
tives and another 4 years in the U.S. 
House of Representatives before being 
elected to the Senate in 2014. 
Here in the Senate, Senator GARDNER 
has been a serious legislator but with a 
cheerful and affable and civil manner. 
He has worked to bridge partisan di-
vides, particularly on energy policy, 
where he has been one of the Repub-
licans’ leading advocates of renewable 
energy. This year, the esteemed Lugar 
Center ranked Senator GARDNER as the 
third most bipartisan Senator. 
I have had the opportunity to work 
with Senator GARDNER on the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee as he led 
the effort to impose sanctions against 
North Korea in his role as chairman of 
the Foreign Relations Subcommittee 
on East Asia, the Pacific, and Inter-
national 
Cybersecurity 
Policy. 
Through 
the 
committee, 
we 
also 
worked together to introduce legisla-
tion to enhance American maritime ca-
pacity and leadership and increase sup-
port to our allies in the Asia-Pacific re-
gion, the Asia-Pacific Maritime Secu-
rity Initiative Act of 2016. I was also 
pleased to work with Senator GARDNER 
in 2019 to introduce the Wildlife Refuge 
System Protection Act, bipartisan leg-
islation to provide legal authority for 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service— 
USFWS—to seek damages for injury or 
harm on National Wildlife Refuges, Na-
tional 
Fish 
Hatcheries, 
and 
other 
USFWS lands and waters. 
My wife Myrna and I have traveled 
with Senator GARDNER and his wife 
Jaime 
to 
promote 
human 
rights 
abroad. His commitment to global 
human rights was crystal clear to 
Myrna and me. I will miss Senator 
GARDNER and his pleasant demeanor, 
but he is still a young man so I am con-
fident he will find new ways to con-
tinue serving all Americans, but espe-
cially the Coloradans he has rep-
resented with distinction for the past 
16 years. I wish him, Jaime, and their 
children Alyson, Thatcher, and Caitlyn 
all the best. 
Senator Martha McSally has only 
been in the Senate for 2 years, but it is 
impossible not to be in awe of her true

grit and determination, perhaps stem-
ming from being the youngest of five 
children. Her father died when she was 
just 12, leaving her mother to raise and 
support her family. Perhaps it was the 
example 
her 
mother 
set—Senator 
McSally was determined to let nothing 
stand in her way. She was the valedic-
torian of her high school and earned an 
appointment to the United States Air 
Force Academy, where she received a 
bachelor’s of science in biology. I am 
privileged to represent the U.S. Naval 
Academy in Annapolis, MD. I have 
served on the board of visitors, and my 
staff and I interview the hundreds of 
young applicants across Maryland who 
aspire to enroll in one of our service 
academies each year. I am not sure 
most Americans are aware of how in-
tensely competitive these positions are 
and what a tremendous honor earning 
an appointment is. Meeting these ap-
plicants, reviewing their extraordinary 
accomplishments at such a young age, 
and seeing their commitment to serv-
ice—willing to put their lives on the 
line, if necessary—restores one’s faith 
in the boundless future of our Nation. 
Senator McSally certainly put her 
life on the line for us and shattered 
gender barriers along the way. She be-
came the first woman in American his-
tory to fly a fighter jet in combat and 
the first woman to command a fighter 
squadron in combat. She deployed six 
times to the Middle East. She helped 
lead and execute the initial air cam-
paign in Afghanistan after the 9/11 ter-
rorist attacks and she supervised com-
bat search and rescue operations in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq. In total, she flew 
325 combat hours and earned a Bronze 
Star and six air medals. She served in 
the U.S. Air Force for 26 years, retiring 
as a full colonel. 
Senator McSally has never been one 
to rest on her laurels. She earned mas-
ters’ degrees from Harvard University’s 
John F. Kennedy School of Govern-
ment and the U.S. Air War College, 
graduating first in her class of 261 sen-
ior military officers. She ran for the 
House of Representatives, first unsuc-
cessfully by a narrow margin in 2012 
but then successfully—again by a nar-
row margin—in 2014, becoming the first 
Republican woman to represent Ari-
zona in Congress. She was reelected in 
2016. She lost a tough race to Senator 
SINEMA in 2018, but Arizona Governor 
Doug Ducey appointed her to finish the 
unexpired term of another war hero, 
our late friend Senator John McCain. 
Unfortunately, I had little oppor-
tunity to work with Senator McSally 
during her 2 years here in the Senate, 
although I did travel with her to Nor-
mandy for the 75th anniversary of D- 
Day, and I saw firsthand her commit-
ment to America’s service men and 
women—especially military sexual as-
sault survivors—to veterans, and to 
military families. Senator McSally is 
an inspiration to all of us, but espe-
cially to women and girls, for her devo-
tion to duty and the incredible odds 
she has overcome and the barriers she 
has broken in her life. Senator McSally 
has said, ‘‘There’s always more that 
unites us than divides us.’’ I agree 
wholeheartedly with that sentiment. 
She is a fighter who will continue to 
fight for our county, and I am grateful 
for that. 
Senator DOUG
JONES
is a native 
Alabaman, a steelworker’s son, who 
grew up during the great struggle for 
civil rights and desegregation in the 
South. He has been involved in that 
struggle all of his life, active in cam-
pus affairs at the University of Ala-
bama, where he earned his bachelor’s 
degree in 1976, and in trying to mod-
ernize Alabama’s court system. 
Senator JONES has the distinction of 
working, being confirmed by, and being 
elected to serve in the U.S. Senate. 
After he graduated from Cumberland 
Law School at Samford University in 
1979, he worked as a staff counsel on 
the Senate Judiciary Committee for 
then-Senator Howell Heflin. Senator 
JONES served as an Assistant U.S. At-
torney from 1980 to 1984. After he 
worked in private practice for several 
years, President Clinton nominated 
him to serve as the U.S. Attorney for 
the Northern District of Alabama, and 
the Senate confirmed his nomination 
in 1997. 
While Senator JONES was the U.S. At-
torney, he successfully prosecuted two 
of the four men who were responsible 
for the heinous bombing of the 16th 
Street Baptist Church in 1963, an at-
tack that killed four young Black girls 
between the ages of 11 and 14 and 
shocked the conscience of our Nation. 
He prosecuted other domestic terror-
ists, including the Ku Klux Klan and 
Eric Rudolph. He won a hard-fought 
special election to the Senate in De-
cember 2017 and has served with honor, 
distinction, and a commitment to find-
ing bipartisan solutions to our Nation’s 
most-pressing problems. 
Senator JONES has fought to protect 
healthcare and to create equal opportu-
nities for all Americans. He led the 
passage of the bipartisan FUTURE Act 
into law last year, legislation that I 
strongly supported to provide perma-
nent funding for historically Black col-
leges and universities and minority- 
serving institutions. He has also cham-
pioned minority-serving financial in-
stitutions and minority-owned banks, 
supporting the efforts to add additional 
funds for these institutions through 
the Paycheck Protection Program. I 
was proud to work with Senator JONES 
on the successful passage of our legisla-
tion to extend the Caribbean Basin 
Economic Recovery Act this year, 
which extends until 2030 duty-free ac-
cess for certain textile goods from 23 
Caribbean countries that are made 
with U.S. yarns, fabrics, and threads 
until 2030. 
Senator JONES is equally committed 
to civility and civil rights. As the Rev-
erend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., so 
famously said, ‘‘The arc or the moral 
universe is long, but it bends toward 
justice.’’ Thanks to Senator JONES’ 
abiding faith and ceaseless efforts, that 
arc is bending faster. I wish him, his 
wife Louise, their children Carson, 
Christopher, and Courtney, and their 
two grandchildren all the best moving 
forward. I know he will continue to 
serve our country, and I am hopeful it 
will be as a member of the incoming 
administration of President-Elect Joe 
Biden. 
Senator TOM UDALL comes from an 
illustrious extended family with a long 
history of distinguished public service, 
including his father Stewart, 
who 
served as Secretary of the Interior 
under President John F. Kennedy and 
Lyndon Baines Johnson from 1961 to 
1969. His uncle Morris ‘‘Mo’’ K. Udall 
was one of the most accomplished and 
beloved Congressmen in U.S. history, 
representing Arizona’s Second District 
for 30 years. While Senator UDALL was 
born in Tucson, he has deep roots in 
New Mexico, starting with his grand-
mother Luna, who was born in New 
Mexico Territory. 
Senator UDALL
earned his under-
graduate degree from Prescott College, 
a bachelor of laws degree from Cam-
bridge, and J.D. from the University of 
New Mexico in 1977. And then joining 
the family tradition, he began his pub-
lic service by clerking for the Honor-
able Oliver Seth, chief justice of the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth 
Circuit. Later, he became a Federal 
prosecutor 
in 
the 
U.S. 
Attorney’s 
criminal division and chief counsel to 
the New Mexico Department of Health 
and Environment. 
Senator UDALL was elected New Mex-
ico Attorney General in 1990 and re-
elected in 1994. He made his mark in 
several areas, but especially in govern-
ment transparency and ethics, a quest 
he would continue in the U.S. House of 
Representatives, where he served five 
highly productive terms, even though 
he was in the minority for four of 
them, passing legislation to establish a 
national renewable energy standard. 
Here in the Senate, Senator UDALL 
has continued his distinguished service 
for two terms in his low-key, quiet, un-
derstated, and effective manner. Just 
this year, he led the passage of the 
Great American Outdoors Act to fund 
our national parks and Federal land 
agencies. He has championed environ-
mental justice and has devoted himself 
to rectifying the injustices our Nation 
has perpetrated against Indian Nations 
and Tribes. Senator UDALL
has re-
mained steadfast in his commitment to 
good and transparent government as 
the lead Senate sponsor of the For the 
People Act. 
I have been privileged to work close-
ly with Senator UDALL on the Commis-
sion on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe, also known as the U.S. Hel-
sinki Commission, and on the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. We have 
focused on strengthening our relation-
ships with our allies, which President 
Trump has put to the test, promoting 
American values around the world, and

fostering 
human 
rights and inter-
national development and conservation 
efforts. 
I will greatly miss Senator UDALL 
here in the Senate but feel fortunate to 
have served with him these last 12 
years in the Senate and for 8 years to-
gether in the House of Representatives 
before that. New Mexicans and all 
Americans have benefited greatly from 
his 30 years in elected office and life-
time of public service. He has honor-
ably and effectively continued his fam-
ily’s noble tradition of stewardship in 
all regards. My wife Myrna and Sen-
ator UDALL’s wife Jill, a tireless advo-
cate on behalf of the Smithsonian’s Na-
tional Museum of the American Indian, 
have become good friends, and Myrna 
and I will miss both of them. I wish 
them and their daughter Amanda all 
the best. 
Senator MIKE ENZI was born in Brem-
erton, WA, where his father was work-
ing in the naval shipyard during World 
War II. He grew up in Thermopolis, 
WY. He came to Washington, DC, for 
college, earning his bachelor’s degree 
in accounting from George Washington 
University in 1966. He began his public 
service in the Wyoming Air National 
Guard from 1967 to 1973. Later, he 
worked in the U.S. Department of the 
Interior, earned a master’s degree from 
the University of Denver, ran his fa-
ther’s 
show 
business, 
and 
became 
mayor of Gillette, WY, when he was 
just 30. 
Senator ENZI served in the Wyoming 
House of Representatives for 4 years 
and in the Wyoming Senate for 6 years 
before being elected to the U.S. Senate 
in 1996 with 54 percent of the vote. That 
was the closest election he has had; he 
garnered over 70 percent of the vote 
each time he sought reelection. 
Senator ENZI is one of the most con-
servative members of the Senate but 
that has not prevented him from reach-
ing across the aisle. He is quiet but his 
accomplishments speak volumes. While 
he chaired the Senate Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions Com-
mittee, it reported 37 bills, 23 of which 
the Senate passed. As he likes to say, 
‘‘People can agree on 80 percent of the 
issues 80 percent of the time, and if 
they leave the other 20 percent out 
they can get a lot done.’’ He has au-
thored more than 100 bills that Presi-
dents of both parties have signed into 
law. 
Senator ENZI and I have served on 
the Senate Finance Committee to-
gether since the 112th Congress, and on 
the Subcommittee on Health Care, 
where we have worked together to find 
bipartisan solutions to expand access 
to affordable, quality healthcare. We 
have also worked together to ensure 
the stability and health of pension 
funds, including recent efforts related 
to the multiemployer union pension 
crisis, and to bolster financial literacy. 
I have also been pleased to work with 
Senator ENZI on legislation to ensure 
prompt payments to small businesses 
working as Federal contractors across 
the Department of Defense, and on our 
Collegiate Housing and Infrastructure 
Act, to help student groups with colle-
giate housing costs. 
Senator ENZI’s grandfatherly mien 
and calm disposition have helped steer 
the Senate through rocky times, and I 
will miss his steady hand on our rud-
der. My wife Myrna will miss his wife 
of 51 years, Diana, an active member of 
the Senate Spouses Club, who also 
works to provide specially trained dogs 
and handlers to countries infested with 
landmines. Senator ENZI
is an avid 
hunter and fly fisherman, and I know 
he will enjoy the opportunity to spend 
more time with Diana; their children 
Amy, Emily, and Brad; and their four 
grandchildren. 
Senator PAT
ROBERTS
is a native 
Kansan from Topeka and a quintessen-
tial plainspoken Midwesterner and ex- 
marine. He is a fourth generation Kan-
san, 
whose 
great-grandfather, 
J.W. 
Roberts, founded the ‘‘Oskaloosa Inde-
pendent,’’ the State’s second oldest 
newspaper. Senator ROBERTS has jour-
nalism and public service coursing 
though his blood. He earned his bach-
elor’s degree in journalism from Kan-
sas State University and then served in 
the U.S. Marine Corps for 4 years be-
fore working as a reporter and then 
editor of several newspapers in Ari-
zona. In 1967, Senator ROBERTS worked 
for then-U.S. Senator Frank Carlson. 
In 1969, he became administrative as-
sistant to then-U.S. Representative 
Keith Sibelius, who represented the 
First District. 
Senator ROBERTS
went on to rep-
resent the First District himself for 16 
years before being elected to the Sen-
ate in 1996, where he has continued to 
serve with distinction for four terms. 
Senator ROBERTS has a well-earned rep-
utation as a national leader on agri-
culture, defense, and healthcare issues. 
He has the distinction of being the first 
person in history to have chaired both 
the House and Senate Committees on 
Agriculture and to author and pass bi-
partisan farm bills in both Chambers. 
He led the passage of the overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan 2018 farm bill, which 
benefited farmers in my home State of 
Maryland and around the Nation. As 
cochairman of the Senate Rural Health 
Caucus, Senator ROBERTS has sought to 
address the challenges that rural com-
munities face in terms of access to 
high-quality healthcare. 
While Senator ROBERTS chaired the 
Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence, he conducted one of the most 
thorough reviews of U.S. intelligence 
gathering and analysis in the wake of 
the faulty intelligence leading to the 
war in Iraq. The committee unani-
mously issued the bipartisan report, 
which frankly and forthrightly re-
vealed systemic failures and provided 
numerous recommendations included 
in the 9/11 Intelligence Reform Act of 
2004. 
Senator ROBERTS has played a piv-
otal role in the creation of two wonder-
ful monuments, one here in Wash-
ington, DC, and the other in his be-
loved Kansas. He served as Chairman of 
the Dwight David Eisenhower Memo-
rial Commission—and that fine memo-
rial on Independence Avenue to Kan-
sas’s favorite son was dedicated earlier 
this year—a fitting capstone to Sen-
ator ROBERTS’ 40 years as an elected of-
ficial. Back in Kansas, he helped to es-
tablish the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, 
one of the most beautiful and majestic 
places in America. Tallgrass prairie 
once stretched from Canada to Mexico, 
covering more than 170 million acres. 
Today, less than 4 percent of it remains 
intact, mostly in the Kansas Flint 
Hills, largely thanks to the efforts of 
Senator ROBERTS. 
I have had the opportunity to work 
with Senator ROBERTS on agricultural 
and healthcare issues, and legislation 
to encourage retirement savings by fos-
tering the growth of S corporations 
owned by Employee Stock Ownership 
Plans—‘‘S-ESOPS’’. I will miss work-
ing with him and his Semper Fi, ‘‘can- 
do’’ approach to problem-solving, but I 
know he is looking forward to spending 
more time with his wife Franki; their 
three children, David, Ashleigh, and 
Anne-Wesley; and their seven grand-
children. 
Senator LAMAR ALEXANDER has had a 
career in public service as long, varied, 
and distinguished as just about any 
other American, working or serving in 
all three branches of the Federal Gov-
ernment. He is a seventh generation 
east Tennessean whose father was an 
elementary school principal and moth-
er 
was 
a 
pre-school 
teacher—thus 
began Senator ALEXANDER’s lifelong in-
terest in education. He graduated from 
Vanderbilt University with a B.A. in 
1962 and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. 
He earned his J.D. from New York Uni-
versity in 1965, was editor of the law re-
view, and a Root-Tilden Scholar. 
Senator ALEXANDER began his public 
service as a clerk for the Honorable 
John Minor Wisdom on the U.S. Court 
of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. He 
worked on the staff of then-U.S. Sen-
ator Howard Baker and as staff assist-
ant to then-President Richard Nixon. 
In 1978, he walked 1,022 miles across 
Tennessee, spent the night with 73 dif-
ferent families, and won election as 
Governor. As Governor, he helped to 
bring the auto industry to the State. 
He was reelected in 1982 and served as 
chair of the National Governors’ Asso-
ciation from 1985 to 1986. He was presi-
dent of the University of Tennessee 
from 
1988 
to 
1991, 
then-President 
George H.W. Bush’s Secretary of Edu-
cation from 1991 to 1993, and a Pro-
fessor of Practice in Public Service at 
Harvard the Kennedy School of Gov-
ernment from 2001 to 2003. Somehow, 
he has also found the time to cofound 
a law firm and two successful busi-
nesses, be a classical and country pian-
ist who has performed on the Grand 
Old Opry and with symphony orches-
tras, and author seven books.

bills that became law, most of which he 
authored. He sponsored the America 
Competes Act of 2007; the Every Stu-
dent Succeeds Act of 2015, greatly bene-
fitting students in my home State of 
Maryland and nationwide; the 21st Cen-
tury Cures Act of 2016; and the Opioid 
Crisis Response Act of 2018. He also au-
thored legislation to modernize how 
songwriters are compensated for their 
works. The list goes on and on. 
Senator ALEXANDER has been a cham-
pion of higher education reform, seek-
ing to simplify the process of applying 
for financial aid and to increase access 
for all students. I have been proud to 
work 
with 
him 
to 
support 
and 
strengthen historically Black colleges 
and universities and minority serving 
institutions. 
On 
the 
environmental 
front, I had the opportunity to work 
with Senator ALEXANDER on legislation 
to end the dumping of mining waste 
into streams, the Appalachia Restora-
tion Act of 2009. 
Senator ALEXANDER is always cour-
teous, an ‘‘eloquent listener,’’ and al-
ways eager to forge bipartisan solu-
tions to our Nation’s problems. Just a 
few days ago, I know Senators and staff 
were delighted to listen to him play 
Christmas carols and hymns on the 
piano in the Hart atrium. We will 
greatly miss his calm and dignified 
presence in the Senate, but he has cer-
tainly earned the opportunity to spend 
more time with his beloved wife of 51 
years, Honey; their children Leslee, 
Kathryn, Andrew, and William; and 
their nine grandchildren. 
Senators ENZI, ROBERTS, and ALEX-
ANDER have served in this institution 
for 66 years combined. Senator UDALL 
has served 12 years, and Senator GARD-
NER has served 6 years. Senators JONES 
and McSally did not have an oppor-
tunity to serve a full term, but all told, 
we are losing close to 90 years of dedi-
cated service to the institution, our 
colleagues, their constituents, and all 
Americans. There is a tradition for de-
parting Senators to give a farewell ad-
dress, and most use the opportunity to 
bemoan the fact that the Senate has 
become less collegial and more par-
tisan. I share that discontent and sad-
ness. I think the best way we can pay 
appropriate tribute to the fine Mem-
bers who are leaving at the end of this 
Congress is by rededicating ourselves 
to preserving and expanding on their 
legacy of bipartisanship. I want to ex-
press my deep admiration of and appre-
ciation to Senators ALEXANDER, ENZI, 
GARDNER, JONES, MCSALLY, ROBERTS, 
and UDALL. I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity to serve with and learn from 
them, and I cherish our friendships.

after the conclusion of the review under this 
paragraph, the Secretary shall notify the re-
quester and the Governor of the affected 
State or Tribal representative of the deter-

‘‘(5) CRITERIA FOR DETERMINATIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN
GENERAL.—The Secretary shall 
make a determination about whether a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred, based on 
the revenue loss thresholds under subpara-
graph (B), and, if a fishery resource disaster 
has occurred, whether the fishery resource 
disaster was due to— 
‘‘(i) a natural cause; 
‘‘(ii) an anthropogenic cause; 
‘‘(iii) a combination of a natural cause and 
an anthropogenic cause; or 
‘‘(iv) an undetermined cause. 
‘‘(B) REVENUE LOSS THRESHOLDS.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Based on the information 
provided or analyzed under paragraph (4)(B), 
the Secretary shall apply the following 12- 
month revenue loss thresholds in deter-
mining whether a fishery resource disaster 
has occurred: 
‘‘(I) Losses greater than 80 percent may re-
sult in a positive determination that a fish-
ery resource disaster has occurred, based on 
the information provided or analyzed under 
paragraph (4)(B). 
‘‘(II) Losses between 35 percent and 80 per-
cent shall be evaluated to determine whether 
economic impacts are severe enough to de-
clare that a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred. 
‘‘(III) Losses less than 35 percent shall not 
be eligible for a determination that a fishery 
resource disaster has occurred. 
‘‘(ii) CHARTER FISHING.—In making a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred, the Secretary shall con-
sider the economic impacts to the charter 
fishing industry to ensure financial coverage 
for charter fishing businesses. 
‘‘(iii) SUBSISTENCE
LOSS.—In considering 
subsistence loss, the Secretary shall evalu-
ate the severity of loss to the fishing com-
munity instead of applying the revenue loss 
thresholds described in clause (i). 
‘‘(C) INELIGIBLE FISHERIES.—A fishery sub-
ject to overfishing in any of the 3 years pre-
ceding the date of a determination under 
this subsection is not eligible for a deter-
mination of whether a fishery resource dis-
aster has occurred unless the Secretary de-
termines that overfishing was not a contrib-
uting factor to the fishery resource disaster. 
‘‘(D) EXCEPTIONAL
CIRCUMSTANCES.—In an 
exceptional circumstance where substantial 
economic impacts to the affected fishery and 
fishing community have been subject to a 
disaster declaration under another statutory 
authority, such as in the case of a natural 
disaster or from the direct consequences of a 
Federal action taken to prevent, or in re-
sponse to, a natural disaster for purposes of 
protecting life and safety, the Secretary may 
determine a fishery resource disaster has oc-
curred without a request. 
‘‘(6) DISBURSAL OF APPROPRIATED FUNDS.— 
‘‘(A) AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary shall 
allocate funds available under paragraph (9) 
for fishery resource disasters. 
‘‘(B) ALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATED FISHERY

AVAIL-
ABILITY.—When there are appropriated funds 
for 1 or more fishery resource disasters, the 
Secretary shall notify— 
‘‘(I) the public; and 
‘‘(II) representatives of affected fishing 
communities with a positive disaster deter-
mination that is unfunded; 
of the availability of funds, not more than 14 
days after the date of the appropriation or 
the determination of a fishery resource dis-
aster, whichever occurs later. 
‘‘(ii) EXTENSION
OF
DEADLINE.—The Sec-
retary may extend the deadline under clause 
(i) by 90 days to evaluate and make deter-
minations on eligible requests. 
‘‘(C) CONSIDERATIONS.—In determining the 
allocation of appropriations for a fishery re-
source disaster, the Secretary shall consider 
commercial, charter, headboat, or seafood

‘‘(ii) Uninsured losses. 
‘‘(iii) Losses of subsistence and Tribal cere-
monial fishing opportunity. 
‘‘(iv) Losses of recreational fishing oppor-
tunity. 
‘‘(v) Aquaculture operations revenue loss. 
‘‘(vi) Direct revenue losses to a fishing 
community. 
‘‘(vii) Treaty obligations.

120 days after receiving notification that 
funds are available, that shall include the

in the form of a grant, direct payment, coop-
erative agreement, loan, or contract. 
‘‘(iii) ELIGIBLE USES.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—Funds allocated for fish-
ery resources disasters under this subsection 
shall restore the fishery affected by such a 
disaster, prevent a similar disaster in the fu-
ture, or assist the affected fishing commu-
nity, and shall prioritize the following uses, 
which are not in order of priority: 
‘‘(aa) Habitat conservation and restoration 
and other activities, including scientific re-
search, that reduce adverse impacts to the 
fishery or improve understanding of the af-
fected species or its ecosystem. 
‘‘(bb) The collection of fishery information 
and other activities that improve manage-
ment of the affected fishery. 
‘‘(cc) In a commercial fishery, capacity re-
duction and other activities that improve

repay the principal of a Federal fishing ca-
pacity reduction loan. 
‘‘(dd) Developing, repairing, or improving

EMPLOYEES.— 
Where appropriate, individuals carrying out

‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
clauses (ii) and (iii), the Federal share of the 
cost of any activity carried out under the au-
thority of this subsection shall not exceed 75 
percent of the cost of that activity. 
‘‘(ii) WAIVER.—The Secretary may waive 
the non-Federal share requirements of this 
subsection, if the Secretary determines 
that— 
‘‘(I) no reasonable means are available 
through which the recipient of the Federal 
share can meet the non-Federal share re-
quirement; and 
‘‘(II) the probable benefit of 100 percent 
Federal financing outweighs the public in-
terest in imposition of the non-Federal share 
requirement. 
‘‘(iii) EXCEPTION.—The Federal share shall 
be equal to 100 percent in the case of— 
‘‘(I) direct assistance as described in para-

SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF HAN-
COCK COUNTY’S 200TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Hancock County, 
Ohio. The perseverance of pioneers and set-
tlers to overcome the challenges faced during 
the early years of the county’s history has per-
sisted throughout the past 200 years. The 
hard work and spirit shown by generations of 
county residents have made Hancock County 
an outstanding example of American inge-
nuity. 
On February 12, 1820, the Ohio Legislature 
enacted legislation creating fourteen new 
counties in northwestern Ohio. One of the 
counties was named Hancock, honoring the 
American Revolutionary hero, John Hancock. 
Hancock County was officially established in 
1820 and encompasses roughly 531 square 
miles. The county is an asset to the great 
State of Ohio through its many contributions in 
the fields of agriculture and manufacturing. 
One of Hancock County’s noteworthy distinc-
tions was having Ohio Governor Joseph 
Vance and songwriter Tell Taylor reside within 
the county. 
By remembering the 200th Anniversary of 
Hancock County, community members and 
Ohio residents recognize the outstanding 
achievements, maintain our pioneer attitude, 
and strive to better our county through the 
principles on which it was founded. Thank you 
and congratulations to Hancock County on this 
significant milestone.

HONORING BOB HANDY FOR HIS 
PUBLIC SERVICE 
HON. SALUD O. CARBAJAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, today, l 
celebrate the service of one of my constituents 
and good friend, Robert ‘‘Bob’’ Handy, who is 
a staunch advocate for veterans and had a 
prodigious 22-year career in the U.S. Navy as 
a Medical Corpsman. 
Bob is the founder and Chairman of Vet-
erans United for Truth, Inc. (VUFT), a vet-
erans’ support non-profit that played a critical 
role in addressing the Veterans Administra-
tion’s (VA) mishandling or veterans’ medical 
services, particularly of Post-Traumatic Stress 
Disorder (PTSD) cases, and restrictive policies 
within the VA that prevented veterans with 
PTSD from appealing negative findings in their 
cases. 
Bob led VUFT as the principal plaintiff in 
VCS et al. v. Nicholson et al., a 2007 class 
action lawsuit that challenged the federal gov-
ernment’s compliance with the First and Fifth 
Amendments to the United States Constitu-
tion, and with section 504 of the Rehabilitation 
Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 794, as it related to 
veterans’ PTSD cases. 
While the suit was initially successful in the 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals, after being re-
ferred there by a District Court, a subsequent 
revised finding by a full panel of the court re-
jected it. The case was supported by millions 
of dollars of pro bona legal support and lasted 
into 2009. 
Bob Handy’s tireless pursuit of this case in 
the public realm brought new attention to the 
serious health issue of PTSD. His work re-
sulted in important changes to the VA’s ap-
proach on this issue. 
I am honored to celebrate Bob Handy’s dis-
tinguished service, exemplary advocacy, lead-
ership, and commitment on behalf of veterans.

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF PUT-
NAM COUNTY’S 200TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Putnam County, 
Ohio. The perseverance of pioneers and set-
tlers to overcome the challenges faced during 
the early years of the county’s history has per-
sisted throughout the past 200 years. The 
hard work and spirit shown by generations of 
county residents have made Putnam County 
an outstanding example of American inge-
nuity. 
On February 12, 1820, the Ohio Legislature 
enacted legislation creating fourteen new 
counties in northwestern Ohio. One of the 
counties was named Putnam, honoring the 
American Revolutionary hero, Israel Putnam. 
Putnam County was officially established in 
1820, but parts of the county remained in 
Wood County until 1824 and in Williams 
County until 1834. Putnam County contains 
roughly 480 square miles, and it was originally 
set aside for Ohio’s Native American people 
by the Treaty of Greenville. Putnam County is 
an asset to the great State of Ohio through its 
many contributions in the fields of agriculture 
and manufacturing. 
By remembering the 200th Anniversary of 
Putnam County, community members and 
Ohio residents recognize the outstanding 
achievements, maintain our pioneer attitude, 
and strive to better our county through the 
principles on which it was founded. Thank you 
and congratulations to Putnam County on this 
significant milestone.

SARY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Mercer County, 
Ohio. The perseverance of pioneers and set-
tlers to overcome the challenges faced during 
the early years of the county’s history has per-
sisted throughout the past 200 years. The 
hard work and spirit shown by generations of 
county residents have made Mercer County 
an outstanding example of American inge-
nuity. 
On February 12, 1820, the Ohio Legislature 
enacted legislation creating fourteen new 
counties in northwestern Ohio. One of the 
counties was named Mercer, honoring the 
American Revolutionary hero, General Hugh 
Mercer. Mercer County was established in 
1820 and it contains roughly 463 square 
miles, including Grand Lake St. Marys. An es-
sential part of Mercer County’s history is con-
nected to the lake, which was dug between 
1837 and 1845 to provide a water source for 
the Miami and Erie Canal. Grand Lake St. 
Marys was the largest man-made lake in the 
world at the time. Today, it is a major tourist 
destination for all to enjoy. Mercer County has 
also been an asset to the great State of Ohio 
through its many contributions in the fields of 
agriculture and manufacturing. 
By remembering the 200th Anniversary of 
Mercer County, community members and Ohio 
residents recognize the outstanding achieve-
ments, maintain our pioneer attitude, and 
strive to better our county through the prin-
ciples on which it was founded. Thank you 
and congratulations to Mercer County on this 
significant milestone.

H.R. 6535, the Coverage for Urban Indian 
Health Providers Act, when it passed this 
House on Thursday, December 17, 2020. En-
actment of H.R. 6535 will address the lack of 
parity under the Federal Tort Claims Act within 
the Indian Health Service for urban Indian 
health programs, and by sending this bill to 
the Senate, and hopefully to the President, we 
arc making a necessary correction that will 
support delivery of health care to Native com-
munities across the country. 
However, while I am proud of the passage 
of this measure, we must not forget that the 
same lack of parity under FTCA continues to 
persist for the Native Hawaiian Health Care 
Systems funded through the Native Hawaiian 
Health Care Improvement Act. I am therefore 
committed to standing with Native Hawaiians 
and their representatives in Congress, includ-
ing Congressman CASE and Senator SCHATZ, 
to ensure that Native Hawaiian Health Care 
Systems are not left behind, and will work with 
them, the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee, the House Natural Resources Com-
mittee, and the Senate Committee for Indian 
Affairs to address the inequitable access to 
Federal Torts Claims Act coverage among Na-
tive health systems in the next Congress. To-
gether, we will continue to fight for the trust 
and treaty rights and access to benefits for all 
of our country’s Native peoples.

OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Hardin County, 
Ohio. The perseverance of pioneers and set-
tlers to overcome the challenges faced during 
the early years of the county’s history has per-
sisted throughout the past 200 years. The 
hard work and spirit shown by generations of 
county residents have made Hardin County an 
outstanding example of American ingenuity. 
On February 12, 1820, the Ohio Legislature 
enacted legislation creating fourteen new 
counties in northwestern Ohio. One of the 
counties was named Hardin, honoring the 
American Revolutionary hero, John Hardin. 
Hardin County was officially established in 
1820 and encompasses roughly 470 square 
miles. The county is home to Ohio Northern 
University, which was established in 1871. 
Hardin County is an asset to the great State 
of Ohio through its many contributions in the 
fields of agriculture and manufacturing. 
By remembering the 200th Anniversary of 
Hardin County, community members and Ohio 
residents recognize the outstanding achieve-
ments, maintain our pioneer attitude, and 
strive to better our county through the prin-
ciples on which it was founded. Thank you

Wood County until 1824 and in Williams 
County until 1834. The county contains rough-
ly 417 square miles and was once part of the 
Great Black Swamp. The unique nature of the 
former swampland provided rich soil which al-
lowed the agricultural community to prosper.

OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Van Wert Coun-
ty, Ohio. The perseverance of pioneers and 
settlers to overcome the challenges faced dur-
ing the early years of the county’s history has 
persisted throughout the past 200 years. The 
hard work and spirit shown by generations of 
county residents have made Van Wert County 
an outstanding example of American inge-

On February 12, 1820, the Ohio Legislature

counties in northwestern Ohio. One of the 
counties was named Van Wert, honoring the 
American Revolutionary hero, Isaac Van Wart. 
Van Wart aided in the 1780 capture of British 
Major John Andre, who was convicted and ex-
ecuted for spying with Benedict Arnold. Van 
Wert County contains roughly 410 square 
miles, and it was officially established in 1820. 
A noteworthy part of Van Wert County’s his-
tory is the establishment of the Brumback Li-
brary. The library was founded in 1890 as the 
first countywide public library to exist in the 
United States, and it continues to serve over 
29,000 residents. Van Wert County is an asset 
to the great State of Ohio through its many 
contributions in the fields of agriculture and 
manufacturing.

HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the Bicentennial of Williams County, 
Ohio. The perseverance of pioneers and set-
tlers to overcome the challenges faced during 
the early years of the county’s history has per-
sisted throughout the past 200 years. The 
hard work and spirit shown by generations of 
county residents have made Williams County 
an outstanding example of American inge-
nuity. 
On February 12, 1820, the Ohio Legislature 
enacted legislation creating fourteen new 
counties in northwestern Ohio. The fourteenth 
new county came to be known as Williams 
County, honoring the Revolutionary War hero 
David Williams. Williams aided in the 1780 
capture of British Major John Andre, who was 
convicted and executed for spying with Bene-
dict Arnold. When Williams County was offi-
cially established in 1820 it originally con-
tained roughly 720 square miles, but it cur-
rently encompasses 420 square miles. A piv-
otal point in Williams County’s history was the 
twenty-year dispute over the northern part of 
Williams County which contributed to the Ohio 
and Michigan war. Eventually, the territory 
lines between the Indiana line and Lake Erie 
were settled, giving Williams County its first 
beginnings as a county in the great state of 
Ohio. 
By remembering the 200th Anniversary of 
Williams County, community members and 
Ohio residents recognize the outstanding 
achievements, maintain our pioneer attitude, 
and strive to better our county on the prin-
ciples on which it was founded. Thank you 
and congratulations to Williams County on this 
significant milestone.

EXCERPTS FROM IRANIAN POLIT-
ICAL 
PRISONERS 
WHO 
WERE 
WITNESSES TO THE 1988 MAS-
SACRE IN IRAN 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD the following release 
which includes excerpts from the statement of 
former Iranian political prisoners, witnesses to 
the 1988 massacre in Iran. 
The Amnesty International report, ‘‘Blood- 
Soaked Secrets: Why Iran’s 1988 Prison Mas-
sacres are Ongoing Crimes Against Human-
ity,’’ on the 30th anniversary of the massacre 
was an important step in accelerating the jus-
tice movement and holding the regime’s offi-
cials to account as those responsible for com-
mitting this great crime. The following are the 
excerpts from the former Iranian political pris-
oners, witnesses to the 1988 massacre in 
Iran: 
We, political prisoners who personally wit-
nessed the 1988 massacre, as part of the large 
family of the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), 
have made a solemn promise to the 30,000 
proud martyrs of this massacre that we will 
spare no effort to shed light on the scope of 
the horrific and inhumane 1988 massacre and 
to ensure its perpetrators face justice. 
Amnesty International can rely on the 
support of political prisoners, families of the 
martyrs, and the Iranian people as it con-
tinues to speak the truth and expose this 
great crime against humanity. The regime’s 
leaders must face the fact that four decades 
of crime and murder, which continued into 
the November 2019 massacre and the execu-
tions of Mostafa Salehi and Navid Afkari 
will not go unanswered. 
We stress in this regard that insulting and 
attacking Amnesty International and its re-
searchers and reporters is deplorable and 
amount to aligning with and accompanying 
the murderous rulers of Iran. As stated in 
the statement issued by 1,404 political pris-
oners, We consider it to be the urgent obliga-
tion of all political prisoners and any dig-
nified human being to expose anyone, wheth-
er a former prisoner or otherwise, with any 
political claim, who serves the interests of 
the clerical regime, and we condemn any si-
lence with respect to such abhorrent actions. 
Political prisoners, witnesses to the 1988 
massacre. October 2020 
Three decades after the 1988 massacre of 
political prisoners in Iran, we are witnessing 
Amnesty International’s efforts to expose 
the details of this great crime. This is a 
crime that the former designated heir to 
Khomeini described at the time as the great-
est crime committed by the clical regime in 
its history and called its perpetrators crimi-
nals: 
This statement was distributed by the Ira-
nian American Community of Texas, member 
of the Organization of Iranian American Com-
munities-US (OIAC)

NOMINATION 
OF 
RETIRED 
GEN-
ERAL LLOYD AUSTIN AS THE 
28TH U.S. SECRETARY OF DE-
FENSE 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Sunday, December 20, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of Congress, as a proud cit-
izen of the United States, as an African Amer-
ican woman, and as a member of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus, I rise in strong sup-
port of President-elect Joe Biden’s nomination 
of retired General Lloyd Austin as the 28th 
U.S. Secretary of Defense. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin is an accom-
plished and respected trailblazer in the United 
States Army. He is a trusted and crisis-tested 
leader who has broken barriers in his historic 
ascent to the highest ranks of the military. 
With more than 40 years of service, Retired 
General Lloyd Austin is a deeply experienced 
and highly decorated commander who has 
served with distinction in several of the Penta-
gon’s most crucial roles. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin is a son of the 
South. He was born in Mobile, Alabama and 
grew up in Thomasville, Georgia. He grad-
uated from West Point United States Military 
Academy and later earned degrees from Au-
burn University, Webster University, the Army 
Command and General Staff College and the 
Army War College. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin was promoted 
to Lieutenant General in 2006 and assumed 
command of the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort 
Bragg. And in 2009 he handed over his com-
mand to become the Director of the Joint 
Staff. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin retired from 
the U.S. Army in 2016 as the first African 
American 
to 
serve 
as 
Commander 
of 
CENTCOM, the U.S. Central Command, 
where he oversaw America’s military strategy 
and joint operations throughout the Middle 
East and in Afghanistan. 
He was the chief architect of the military 
campaign to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq 
and Syria and became the second highest 
ranking commander in Iraq, taking command 
of the Multi-National Corps—Iraq. As com-
mander, he directed the operations of approxi-
mately 152,000 joint and coalition forces in all 
sectors of Iraq. 
He led the transition of the U.S. and Coali-
tion military forces and equipment out of Iraq, 
the largest logistics operation undertaken by 
the Army in six decades. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin served in the 
82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, Oper-
ations Officer for the Army Indianapolis District 
Recruiting Command, Executive Officer 1st 
Brigade 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, 
Executive Officer for the 2nd Battalion 22nd 
Infantry, Chief of Joint Operations Division J– 
3, Assistant Division Commander for Maneu-
ver 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Com-
mander of 2nd Battalion 505th Parachute In-
fantry Regiment, Commanding General of U.S. 
Forces in Iraq, Army Vice Chief of Staff and 
as Commander of CENTCOM. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin is highly deco-
rated with many awards and decorations in-
cluding four Defense Distinguished Service 
Medals, three Army Distinguished Service 
Medals, a Silver Star, two Defense Superior 
Service Medals, and two Legion of Merit deco-
rations. 
Retired General Lloyd Austin, if confirmed, 
will become the first African American Sec-
retary of Defense which culminates a barrier- 
breaking career as the first African American 
general to command an Army Division in com-
bat, to lead a Corps in combat, to command 
an entire theater of war, and to serve as Com-
mander of U.S. Central Command. 
Secretary-designate Austin has proven and 
demonstrated extraordinary leadership across 
a lifetime of distinguished service and is well 
prepared to lead our nation’s military as a 
strong and dedicated civilian leader.
